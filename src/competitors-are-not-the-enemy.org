[原文地址](https://medium.com/swlh/competitors-are-not-the-enemy-accbaa0fe5b1)

Competitors prove that there is a market for you to try and own.

- Bad Design Is the Enemy
- A Weak Product Is The Enemy
- Bad Cashflow Is The Enemy
- Small Margins Are The Enemy
- Customer Churn Is The Enemy
- Distractions Are The Enemy
- Weak Strategy Is The Enemy
- Bad Execution Is The Enemy
- Ignorance is the enemy

The market is always large enough for many players to stake a decent claim and build a valuable business.

You are not playing a zero sum game.
