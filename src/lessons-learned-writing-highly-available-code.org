- Put limits on everything.
- Retry, but with exponential back-off.
- Use supervisors and watchdog processes.
- Add health checks, and use them to re-route requests or automate rollbacks. 
   - As a developer, think about how to boil all the variables around your system into a single boolean “is this thing healthy? Is it working?”
- Redundancy is more than just nice-to-have, it’s a requirement.
- Prefer battle-tested tools over the “new hotness”.
  - It can be tempting to reach for the newest tools that promise big new features.
  - New technologies frequently have unknown-to-you and unknown-to-them modes of failure.
  - Newer tools also tend to have immature facilities for running in production.
