Indeed, "LISP" originally stood for "LISt Processing." By the same token, I suppose that the C programming language could have been called CHAP(for "CHAracter Processing") and Fortran could have been FLOP(for "FLOating-point Processing").

While lists are the heart of Lisp, functions are the soul.

A LISP programmer knows the value of everything but the cost of nothing - Alan J. Perlis.
