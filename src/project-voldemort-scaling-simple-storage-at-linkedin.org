#+title: Project Voldemort: Scaling Simple Storage at LinkedIn

We really like Google’s Bigtable , but we didn’t think it made sense to try to build it if you didn’t have access to a low-latency GFS implementation. 

We were inspired by Amazon’s Dynamo paper , which seemed to meet the needs we have as well as being feasible to implement with low-latency queries–much of our design for Project Voldemort comes from that.

We were able to move applications that needed to handle hundreds of millions of reads and writes per day from over 400ms to under 10ms while simultaneously increasing the amount of data we store.
