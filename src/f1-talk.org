#+title: F1: The Fault-Tolerant Distributed RDBMS Supporting Google's Ad Business
http://research.google.com/pubs/pub38125.html @ 2012

*** Today's Talk
- F1 - A Hybrid Database combining the
  - Scalability of Bigtable
  - Usability and functionality of SQL databases

- Key Ideas
  - Scalability: Auto-sharded storage
  - Availability & Consistency: Synchronous
    - High commit latency: Can be hidden
      - Hierarchical schema (spanner提供层级schema)
      - Protocol buffer column types
      - Efficient client code
    - Can you have a scalable database without going NoSQL?  Yes.

*** Our Legacy DB: Sharded MySQL
- Sharding Strategy
  - Sharded by customer
  - Apps optimized using shard awareness

- Limitations
  - Availability
    - Master / slave replication -> downtime during failover
    - Schema changes -> downtime for table locking
  - Scaling
    - Grow by adding shards
    - Rebalancing shards is extremely difficult and risky
    - Therefore, limit size and growth of data stored in database
  - Functionality
    - Can't do cross-shard transactions or joins

*** Our Solution: F1
- A new database
  - built from scratch,
  - designed to operate at Google scale,
  - without compromising on RDBMS features.
  - Co-developed with new lower-level storage system, Spanner

- Underlying Storage - [[file:spanner.org][Spanner]]
  - Descendant of Bigtable, Successor to Megastore
  - Properties
    - Globally distributed
    - Synchronous cross-datacenter replication (with Paxos)
    - Transparent sharding, data movement
    - General transactions
      - Multiple reads followed by a single atomic write
      - Local or cross-machine (using 2PC)
    - Snapshot reads
  - Hierarchical Schema
    - Explicit table hierarchies.  Example:
    - Customer (root table): PK (CustomerId)
    - Campaign (child): PK (CustomerId, CampaignId)
    - AdGroup (child):   PK (CustomerId, CampaignId, AdGroupId)
  - Clustered Storage
    - Child rows under one root row form a cluster （属于同一个root的数据形成一个cluster)
    - Cluster stored on one machine (unless huge) （然后这个cluster通常会存放在一个机器上面）
    - Transactions within one cluster are most efficient
    - Very efficient joins inside clusters (can merge with no sorting)
  - Protocol Buffer Column Types （这个应该有很多好处，能够在很大程度上减少表的数量以及减少阻抗）

- Architecture
  - Sharded Spanner servers
    - data on GFS and in memory
  - Stateless F1 server
  - Pool of workers for query execution

- Features
  - Relational schema
    - Extensions for hierarchy and rich data types
    - Non-blocking schema changes
  - Consistent indexes
  - Parallel reads with SQL or Map-Reduce

*** How We Deploy
- Five replicas needed for high availability
  - Why not three?
    - Assume one datacenter down
    - Then one more machine crash => partial outage
  - Replicas spread across the country to survive regional disasters
    - Up to 100ms apart（传输距离达到了100ms以上？）

- Performance
  - Very high commit latency - 50-100ms（因为写需要跨越几个机房）
  - Reads take 5-10ms - much slower than MySQL（如果单次读取在5-10ms算是比较快的了）
  - High throughput

- Coping with High Latency
  - Preferred transaction structure
    - One read phase: No serial reads
    - Read in batches
  - Read asynchronously in parallel
    - Buffer writes in client, send as one RPC
  - Use coarse schema and hierarchy（通过提供protobuf column type来提供粗粒度的schema）
    - Fewer tables and columns
    - Fewer joins
  - For bulk operations
    - Use small transactions in parallel - high throughput
