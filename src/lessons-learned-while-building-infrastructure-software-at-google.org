#+title: Lessons Learned While Building Infrastructure Software at Google

** GFS
- Developed by subset of same people working on indexing system
- Identified minimal set of features needed
   - e.g. Not POSIX compliant
  - actual data was distributed, but kept metadata centralized
  - Colossus: Follow-on system developed many years later distributed the metadata
- Lesson: Don’t solve everything all at once

** MapReduce
- Developed by two people that were also doing the indexing system rewrite
  - squinted at various phases with an eye towards coming up with common abstraction
- Initial version developed quickly
  - proved initial API utility with very simple implementation
  - rewrote much of implementation 6 months later to add lots of  the performance wrinkles/tricks that appeared in original paper
- Lesson: Very close ties with initial users of system make things happen faster
  - in this case, we were both building MapReduce and using it simultaneously 

** BigTable
- no distributed transactions, no cross-row joins
- initial design was just in a single cluster
- follow-on work added eventual consistency across many geographically distributed BigTable instances

** Spanner
- Several variations of eventual client API
- Started to develop with many possible customers in mind, but no particular customer we were working closely with
- Eventually we worked closely with Google ads system as initial customer
- Different API than BigTable
  - Harder to move users with existing heavy BigTable usage

** Designing & Building Infrastructure
- Identify common problems, and build software systems to address them in a general way
- Important to not try to be all things to all people 
  - Clients might be demanding 8 different things
  - Doing 6 of them is easy
  - handling 7 of them requires real thought
  - dealing with all 8 usually results in a worse system
  - more complex, compromises other clients in trying to satisfy everyone
- *Don't build infrastructure just for its own sake:*
  - Identify common needs and address them
  - Don't imagine unlikely potential needs that aren't really there
- *Best approach: use your own infrastructure (especially at first!)*
  - (much more rapid feedback about what works, what doesn't) 
- *If not possible, at least work very closely with initial client team*
  - ideally sit within 50 feet of each other
  - keep other potential clients needs in mind, but get system 
  - working via close collaboration with first client first
