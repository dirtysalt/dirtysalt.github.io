** Foreword
As you get ready for your interviews, consider these suggestions:
- Write Code on Paper
- Know Your Resume
- Don’t Memorize Solutions
- Talk Out Loud

Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly (very few candidates do!), but rather, *it is about answering questions better than other candidates.* So don’t stress out when you get a tricky question - everyone else probably thought it was hard too!

** Introduction

** Behind the Scenes
*** The Microsoft Interview
- Microsoft wants smart people Geeks. People who are passionate about technology.
- You'll have a short interview with a recruiter where he or she will give you a sample question. Your recruiter is usually there to prep you, and not to grill you on techni- cal questions. Be nice to your recruiter. Your recruiter can be your biggest advocate, even pushing to re-interview you if you stumbled on your first interview. They can fight for you to be hired - or not!
- During the day, you'll do four or five interviews, often with two different teams. Unlike many companies, where you meet your interviewers in a conference room, you'll meet with your Microsoft interviewers in their once. This is a great time to look around and get a feel for the team.
- Depending on the team, interviewers may or may not share their feedback on you with the rest of the interview loop.
- When you complete your interviews with a team, you might speak with a hiring manager. If so, that’s a great sign! It likely means that you passed the interviews with a particular team. It’s now down to the hiring manager’s decision.
- You might get a decision that day, or it might be a week. After one week of no word from HR, send them a friendly email asking for a status update.

Definitely Prepare: *“Why do you want to work for Microsoft?”*

In this question, Microsoft wants to see that you’re passionate about technology. A great answer might be, “I’ve been using Microsoft software as long as I can remember, and I'm really impressed at how Microsoft manages to create a product that is universally excellent. For example, I’ve been using Visual Studio recently to learn game programming, and it’s APIs are excellent.” Note how this shows a passion for technology!

*** The Amazon Interview
- Amazon’s recruiting process usually begins with one or two phone screens in which you in- terview with a specific team. The engineer who interviews you will usually ask you to write simple code and read it aloud on the phone They will ask a broad set of questions to explore what areas of technology you’re familiar with.
- Next, you fly to Seattle for four or five interviews with one or two teams which have selected you based on your resume and phone interviews. You will have to code on a whiteboard, and some interviewers will stress other skills. Interviewers are each assigned a specific area to probe and may seem very different from each other.
- They can not see other feedback until they have submitted their own and they are discouraged from discussing it until the hiring meeting.
- Amazon’s “bar raiser” interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high. If one interview seems significantly harder and different, that’s most likely the bar raiser This person has both significant experience with interviews and veto power in the hiring decision.
- While Amazon’s recruiters are excellent at following up with candidates, occasionally there are delays. If you haven’t heard from Amazon within a week, we recommend a friendly email.

Definitely Prepare:
- Amazon is a web-based company, and that means they care about scale. Make sure you prepare for questions in “Large Scale.” You don’t need a background in distributed systems to answer these questions. See our recommendations in the System Design and Memory Limits Chapter.
- Additionally, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object oriented design. Check out the Object Oriented Design chapter for sample questions and suggestions.

*** The Google Interview
- However, because Google HR can be a little disorganized, we recommend being proactive in communication.
- A Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect tough technical questions.
- On your on-site interview, you'll interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer. Interviewer feedback is kept confidential from the other interviewers, so you can be assured that you enter each interview with blank slate. Your lunch interviewer doesn’t submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity to ask honest questions.
- Written feedback is submitted to a hiring committee of engineers to make a hire/no-hire recommendation. Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience and Communication) and you are given a score from 1.0 to 4.0 overall.
- The hiring committee understands that you can’t be expected to excel in every interview, but if multiple people raise the same red flag (arrogance, poor coding skills, etc), that can disqualify you. A hiring committee typically wants to see one interviewer who is an “enthusiastic endorser”. In other words, a packet with scores of 3.6, 3.1, 3.1 and 2.6 is better than all 3.1s. Your phone screen is usually not a strong factor in the final decision.
- The Google hiring process can be slow. If you don’t hear back within one week, politely ask your recruiter for an update. A lack of response says nothing about your performance.

Definitely Prepare:
- As a web-based company, Google cares about how to design a scalable system. So, make sure you prepare for questions from “System Design and Memory Limits”
- Additionally, many Google interviewers will ask questions involving Bit Manipulation, so please brush up on these questions.

*** The Apple Interview
- Much like the company itself, Apple’s interview process has minimal beaucracy.
- The inter- viewers will be looking for excellent technical skills, but a passion for the position and company is also very important. While it’s not a prerequisite to be a Mac user, you should at least be familiar with the system.
- The interview process typically begins with a recruiter phone screen to get a basic sense of your skills, followed up by a series of technical phone screens with team members.
- Once you’re invited on campus, you'll typically be greeted by the recruiter who provides an overview of the process. You will then have 6-8 interviews with members of the team for which you’re interviewing, as well as key people with whom your team works.
- You can expect a mix of 1-on-1 and 2-on-1 interviews. Be ready to code on a whiteboard and make sure all of your thoughts are clearly communicated. Lunch is with your potential future manager and appears more casual, but is still an interview. Each interviewer is usually focused on a different area and is discouraged from sharing feedback unless there’s something they want subsequent interviewers to drill into.
- Towards the end of the day, your interviewers will compare notes and if everyone still feels you’re a viable candidate, you'll interview with the director and then VP of the organization you’re applying to. While this decision is rather informal, it’s a very good sign if you make it. This decision also happens behind the scenes and if you don’t pass, you'll simply be escorted out of the building without ever having been the wiser (until now)
- If you made it to the director and VP interviews, all of your interviewers will gather in a conference room to give an official thumbs up or thumbs down The VP typically won’t be present, but can still veto the hire if they weren’t impressed.
- Your recruiter will usually follow up a few days later, but feel free to ping your recruiter for updates.

Definitely Prepare:
- If you know what team you’re interviewing with, make sure you read up on that product. What do you like about it? What would you improve? Offering specific recommendations can show your passion for the job.
- Also, Apple employees are huge Apple fans. You should show this same passion in your interview.

*** The Yahoo Interview
- While Yahoo tends to only recruit at the top 10 – 20 schools, other candidates can still get interviewed through Yahoo’s job board (or – better yet – if they can get an internal referral). If you’re one of the lucky ones selected, your interview process will start off with a phone screen. Your phone screen will be with a senior employee (tech lead, manager, etc)
- You will typically interview with 6 – 7 people on the same team for 45 minutes each. Each interviewer will have an area of focus(Database,  Archiecture etc). Interviews will often be composed as follows:
  - 5 minutes: General conversation Tell me about yourself, your projects, etc
  - 20 minutes: Coding question For example, implement merge sort
  - 20 minutes: System design For example, design a large distributed cache These questions will often focus on an area from your past experience or on something your interviewer is cur-rently working on
- At the end of the day, you will likely meet with a Program Manag- er or someone else for a general conversation (product demos, concerns about the company, your competing offers, etc). Meanwhile, your interviewers will discuss your performance and attempt to come to a decision The hiring manager has the ultimate say and will weigh the positive feedback against the negative.
- If you have done well, you will often get a decision that day, but this is not always the case. There can be many reasons that you might not be told for several days – for example, the team may feel it needs to interview several other people.

Definitely Prepare:
- Yahoo, almost as a rule, asks questions about system design, so make sure you prepare for that. They want to know that you can not only write code, but that you can design software. Don’t worry if you don’t have a background in this - you can still reason your way through it!

** Interview War Stories

While the technical questions on computer science obviously are very important, the most important interview question is not covered in this guidebook. In fact, it’s often the single most question in your interviewers' minds as they grill you in that little room. Despite the questions on polymorphism and heaps and virtual machines, the question they really want an answer to is ... *Would I have a beer with this guy?*

The team of developers and managers interviewing you have their own tasks and projects waiting for them, back at their own desks. Believe me, they’re hoping that every interview is going to be the last one. They'd rather be doing anything else. There might be a batch of upcoming projects looming on their calendar, and they need more manpower if they’re going to even have a prayer of making their deadline.

While they may not literally be asking themselves “Would I have a beer with this guy (or gal)”, they are looking to see how well you would fit in with the team, and how you would affect team chemistry. If they hire you, you’re all going to be spending a lot of time together for the next few months or years, and they want to know that they can rely on you – and maybe even come to consider you a friend and colleague. They want to know that they can depend on you. And as tempting as it might be to them to just settle and hire the next person who comes along, they know better.

** Before the Interview
*** Resume Advice
Resume screeners look for the same things that interviewers do:
- *Are you smart?*
- *Can you code?*
That means that you should present your resume to show those two things. Your love of tennis, traveling, or magic cards won’t do much to show that, so it’s likely just wasting space.Keep in mind that recruiters only spend a fixed amount of time (about 20 seconds) looking at your resume. If you limit the content to the best, most impressive, most relevant items, they’ll jump out at the recruiter Weak items only dilute your resume and distract the recruiter from what you’d like them to see.

-----

*Writing Strong Bullets:*
- For each role, try to discuss your accomplishments with the following approach: “Accom- plished X by implementing Y which led to Z” Here’s an example:
- “Reduced object rendering time by 75% by applying Floyd’s algo- rithm, leading to a 10% reduction in system boot time”
- “Increased average match accu- racy from 1.2 to 1.5 by implementing a new comparison algorithm based on windiff”
Not everything you did will fit into this approach, but the principle is the same: show what you did, how you did it, and what the results were Ideally, you should try to make the results “measurable” somehow.

-----

*Advice for Non-Native English Speakers and Internationals:*
- Proofreading: Some companies will throw out your resume just because of a typo. Please get at least one native English speaker to proofread your resume.
- Personal Information: For US positions, do not include age, marital status, or nationality. This sort of personal information is not appreciated by companies, as it creates a legal liabil- ity for them However, you may want to include your current work authorization / visa status, particularly when applying to smaller companies who may be unable to sponsor candidates.

*** Behavioral Preparation
Behavioral questions are asked for a variety of reasons
- They can be asked either to get to know your personality,
- to more deeply understand your resume,
- or just to ease you into an interview Either way,
these questions are important and can be prepared for.

Behavioral questions are usually of the form “tell me about a time when you ”, and may ask for an example from a specific project or position. I recommend filling in the following “preparation grid” as shown below:
|                          | Project1 | Project2 | Project3 | Project4 |
|--------------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------|
| Most Challenging         |          |          |          |          |
| What You Learned         |          |          |          |          |
| Most Interesting         |          |          |          |          |
| Hardest Bug              |          |          |          |          |
| Enjoyed Most             |          |          |          |          |
| Conflicts with Teammates |          |          |          |          |

In each cell, put the corresponding story. We recommend reducing each story to just a couple keywords that you can write in each cell This will make the grid easier to study

行为型问题:
- So tell me about yourself.
- What is your greatest weakness?
- Have you ever had a conflict with a co-worker? How did you solve it?
- What is your most challenging/interesting project?
- Where do you see yourself in five years?

-----

*What questions should you ask the interviewer?*
- Genuine Questions: These are the questions you actually want to know ideas of questions that are valuable to many candidates:
  - “How much of your day do you spend coding?”
  - “How many meetings do you have every week?”
  - “What is the ratio of testers to developers to product managers? What is the interac- tion like? How does project planning happen on the team?”
- Insightful Questions: These questions are designed to demonstrate your deep knowledge of programming or technologies.
  - “I noticed that you use technology X How do you handle problem Y?”
  - “Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits like A, B, C, but many companies choose not to use it because of issue D”
- Passion Questions: These questions are designed to demonstrate your passion for technology.
  - “I’m very interested in scalability Did you come in with a background in this, or what opportunities are there to learn about it?”
  - “I’m not familiar with technology X, but it sounds like a very interesting solution Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?”

*** Technical Preparation
- Memorizing or trying to learn specific questions won’t help you!
- Try to solve the problem on your own.
- Write the code for the algorithm on paper.
- Type your paper code as-is into a computer.
- *Do a mock interview.* CareerCup offers a mock interview

** The Interview and Beyond
https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/tree/master/non-technical

*** Handling Behavioral Questions
- Be Specific, Not Arrogant # 将问题说的具体一些就不会显得傲慢
- Limit Details # 同样也不要说的太多具体，限制细节，否则有可能会把面试官搞晕
- Ask Good Questions
- Structure Answers Using S.A.R(Situation, Action, Response) # 当时情况，如何分析的，如何行动的，以及最后的结果。其中如何分析的这点没有办法放在简历上，其他几点在简历上也比较简略，所以这些都可以在面试中体现出来

Arrogance is a redflag, but you still want to make yourself sound impressive. So how do you make yourself sound good without being arrogant? By being specific! Specificity means giving just the facts and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation. Consider an example:
- Candidate #1: “I basically did all the hard work for the team.”
- Candidate #2: “I implemented the file system, which was considered one of the most challenging components because …”
Candidate #2 not only sounds more impressive, but she also appears less arrogant.

*** Handling Technical Questions
A technical interview question can be solved utilizing a five step approach:
1. Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity
2. Design an Algorithm
3. Write pseudo-code first, but make sure to tell your interviewer that you’re writing pseudo-code! Otherwise, he/she may think that you’re never planning to write “real” code, and many interviewers will hold that against you
4. Write your code, not too slow and not too fast
5. Test your code and carefully fix any mistakes

*** Five Algorithm Approaches
*** The Offer and Beyond
- *Negotiating.* It’s Always Negotiable! Ok, maybe not always, but usually an offer is negotiable even if a recruiter tells you otherwise. It helps if you have a competing offer But, *don’t lie – Microsoft knows what Google offers, so it just won’t be realistic if you make up numbers.* Also, technol- ogy is a small world, and people talk. Be honest.
- *What’s the money like, really?* Think about the full offer package Many companies will have impressive salaries, but small annual bonuses Other companies will have huge annual bonuses, but lower salaries Make sure you look at the *full package (salary, signing bonus, health care benefits, raises, annual bonus, relocation, stock, promotions, etc)* It’s very confusing, and it’s often not clear which company is offering more
- *What about your career options?* I can’t give you some magical formula to compute which offer to accept, but here’s what I’d recommend thinking about (in no particular order):
  - Career Path: Make a plan for your career What do you want to do 5, 10 and 15 years out? What skills will you need to develop? Which company or position will help you get there?
  - Promotion Opportunity: Do you prefer to move into management, or would you prefer to become an increasingly senior developer?
  - Money and Benefits: Of course, the money matters (but if you’re early in your career, it probably doesn’t matter much). As mentioned above, make sure you look at the full package.
  - Happiness: Did you like the people? The products? The location? It’s hard to tell, of course, before you work there. What are the options to change teams if you’re unhappy?
  - Brand Name: The company’s brand name can mean a lot for your future career. Some company names will open doors, while others will not as much.
  - *What about company stability? Personally, I think it matters much less than most people think. There are so many software companies out there. If you get laid off and need to find a new job, will it be difficult to find a new one? Only you can answer that.*

*** Top Ten Mistakes Candidates Make
- Practicing on a Computer
- Not Rehearsing Behavioral Questions
- Not Doing a Mock Interview
- Trying to Memorize Solutions
- Talking Too Much
- Talking Too Little
- Rushing
- Not Debugging
- Sloppy Coding
- Giving Up

*** Frequently Asked Questions
*Should I tell my interviewer if I know a question?*

Yes! You should definitely tell your interviewer if you’ve previously heard the question This seems silly to some people - if you already know the question (and answer), you could ace the question, right? Not quite

Here’s why we strongly recommend that you tell your interviewer that you’ve heard the question:
1. Big honesty points. This shows a lot of integrity That’s huge. Remember that the interviewer is evaluating you as a potential teammate I don’t know about you, but I personally prefer to work with honest people!
2. The question might have changed ever-so-slightly. You don’t want to risk repeating the wrong answer
3. If you easily belt out the right answer, it’s obvious to the interviewer. They know how hard a problem is supposed to be. It’s very hard to “pretend” to struggle through a question, because you just can’t approach it the same way other candidates do.

** Interview Questions
- Data Structures
- Concepts and Algorithms
- Knowledge Based
- Additional Review Problems

*** Arrays and Strings
- 1.1 Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?
- 1.2 Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as five characters, including the null character.)
- 1.3 Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer.
- 1.4 Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
- 1.5 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.
- (x) 1.6 Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image
- 1.7 Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0.
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/description/
- (x) 1.8 Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i e , “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).

*** Linked Lists
Questions:
- 2.1 Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
- 2.2 Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.
- 2.3 Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node.
- 2.4 You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1’s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
- (x) 2.5 Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
  - Assume P,Q at head. P proceeds 1 step, and Q proceed 2 step. There is k nodes before entry node of the circular list. And they takes u step to meet each other at p in the circular list. So we have following equations.
       1. k + xn + p= 2u # Q position.
       2. k + yn + p = u # P position.
       3. u = zn # using 1 and 2.
       4. (k + p) = z'n # using 2 and 3.
       5. k % n = (n-p) # done. 这个时候从开头以及当前位置分别追踪直到相遇，相遇点就是loop的起始点

*** Stacks and Queues
Questions:
- 3.1 Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
- (x) 3.2 How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/
- 3.3 Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks, and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
  - FOLLOW UP. Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
- 3.4 In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (e.g., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraints: (A) Only one disk can be moved at a time (B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod. (C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk. Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using Stacks.
- 3.5 Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/
  - https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-queue-using-two-stacks
- (x) 3.6 Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order. You should not make any assumptions about how the stack is implemented.

3.4 这个问题可以做个扩展，就是如何存在R根柱子的话，应该是什么样的解法？我觉得可以先把头部几个plates先放到(R-3)根柱子上，然后按照Hanoi的方法移动下面几个plates, 最后把头部plates放回到目的地。 R=3的时候，最少步数是 2**N - 1. R>3的时候
- 先移动R-3个盘子，
- 剩余的plates需要 2^(N-R+3)-1
- 然后将开始R-3盘子移动到目的地
- 所以总数是2*(R-3) + 2^(N-R+3) - 1

Questions:
- 5.1 You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M. Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10101, i = 2, j = 6. Output: N = 10001010100
- 5.2 Given a (decimal - e.g. 3.72) number that is passed in as a string, print the binary representation If the number can not be represented accurately in binary, print “ERROR”
- (x) 5.3 Given an integer, print the next smallest and next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.
- 5.4 Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n-1)) == 0).
- 5.5 Write a function to determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to integer B.
  - https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/description/
- 5.6 Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e g , bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, etc).
- 5.7 An array A[1...n] contains all the integers from 0 to n except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is “fetch the jth bit of A[i]”, which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?

*** Brain Teasers
- Don’t panic when you get a brain teaser. Interviewers want to see how you tackle a problem; they don’t expect you to immediately know the answer. Start talking, and show the inter- viewer how you approach a problem
- In many cases, you will also find that the brain teasers have some connection back to fundamental laws or theories of computer science.
- If you’re stuck, we recommend simplifying the problem. Solve it for a small number of items or a special case, and then see if you can generalize it.

Questions:
- 6.1 Add arithmetic operators (plus, minus, times, divide) to make the following expression true: 3 1 3 6 = 8. You can use any parentheses you’d like.
  - (3 + 1) / (3 / 6)
- (x) 6.2 There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board?
- 6.3 You have a five quart jug and a three quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
- (x) 6.4 A bunch of men are on an island. A genie comes down and gathers everyone together and places a magical hat on some people’s heads (i e , at least one person has a hat). The hat is magical: it can be seen by other people, but not by the wearer of the hat himself. To remove the hat, those(and only those who have a hat) must dunk themselves underwater at exactly midnight. If there are n people and c hats, how long does it take the men to remove the hats? The men cannot tell each other (in any way) that they have a hat.
- (x) 6.5 There is a building of 100 floors If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it will break. If it’s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You’re given 2 eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.
  - dp[t][s][e] = 1 + min{ i=[s,e], max(dp[t-1][s][i-1], dp[t][i+1][e]) }. if(s>e) 0 else if(t==0) e-s+1
  - #note: not easy to deduce actions from dp
  - #note: and only one step can be decided. I've attached the code below.
- (x) 6.6 There are one hundred closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all one hundred lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then he goes to every third locker and closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed (e.g., he toggles every third locker). After his one hundredth pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker number one hundred, how many lockers are open?
  - only n = p * p have been flipped with odd number and final status is open.

*** Object Oriented Design
*** Recursion
- All problems that can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively (though the code may be much more complicated). Before diving into a recursive code, ask yourself how hard it would be to implement this algorithm iteratively. Discuss the trade-offs with your interviewer.
- Recursive algorithms can be very space inefficient. Each recursive call adds a new layer to the stack, which means that if your algorithm has O(n) recursive calls then it uses O(n) memory Ouch! This is one reason why an iterative algorithm may be better.

Questions:
- 11.1 If you were integrating a feed of end of day stock price information (open, high, low, and closing price) for 5,000 companies, how would you do it? You are responsible for the development, rollout and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the feed. Describe the different methods you considered and why you would recommend your approach. The feed is delivered once per trading day in a comma-separated format via an FTP site. The feed will be used by 1000 daily users in a web application.
- 11.2 How would you design the data structures for a very large social network (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc)? Describe how you would design an algorithm to show the connection, or path, between two people (e g , Me -> Bob -> Susan -> Jason -> You).
  - 我觉得可以为每个人存储2度关系，这个应该是可以接受的。比如Me, Bob, Susan(2rd by Bob)，因为2度扩展出去的人数应该不是很多比如10^6.
  - 然后如果要找到Me->You之间关系的话，因为You, Jason, Susan(2rd By Jason). 这样只需要做两个bit set的join即可找到共同联系人，拿You的2度bits和Me的2度bits做join即可。
  - 大部分情况下面使用这种方式都可以找到共同联系人，除非是这两个人关系特别特别远。

The application is single threaded, and uses only the C standard library. What programming errors could be causing this crash? How would you test each one?
- 12.3 We have the following method used in a chess game: boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y) x and y are the coordinates of the chess board and it returns whether or not the piece can move to that position. Explain how you would test this method.
- 12.4 How would you load test a webpage without using any test tools?
  - response time
  - throughput
  - resource utilization
- 12.6 How would you test an ATM in a distributed banking system?

*** Databases
Questions:
- 15.2 What are the different types of joins? Please explain how they differ and why certain types are better in certain situations.
  - inner join
  - outer join
    - left outer join
    - right outer join
    - full outer join

*** Low Level
Questions:
- 16.1 Explain the following terms: virtual memory, page fault, thrashing.
- (x) 16.2 What is a Branch Target buffer? Explain how it can be used in reducing bubble cycles in cases of branch misprediction.
- (x) 16.3 Describe direct memory access (DMA). Can a user level buffer / pointer be used by kernel or drivers?
  - The “DMA Controller” manages this by requesting the System bus access (DMA request) from CPU.
  - CPU completes its current task and grants access by as- serting DMA acknowledgement signal.
  - Once it gets the access, it reads/writes the data and returns back the system bus to the CPU by asserting the bus release signal.
  - This transfer is faster than the usual transfer by CPU.
  - Between this time CPU is involved with processing task which doesn’t require memory access.
- (x) 16.4 Write a step by step execution of things that happen after a user presses a key on the keyboard. Use as much detail as possible.
  - keyboard controller
  - save scan code into its buffer
  - sends a hardware interrupt to the processor
  - interrupt handler

- 16.6 Discuss how would you make sure that a process doesn’t access an unauthorized part of the stack.
- 16.7 What are the best practices to prevent reverse engineering of DLLs?.
- (x) 16.8 A device boots with an empty FIFO queue. In the first 400 ns period after startup, and in each subsequent 400 ns period, a maximum of 80 words will be written to the queue. Each write takes 4 ns. A worker thread requires 3 ns to read a word, and 2 ns to process it before reading the next word. What is the shortest depth of the FIFO such that no data is lost?
- 16.9 Write an aligned malloc & free function that takes number of bytes and aligned byte (which is always power of 2). EXAMPLE:
  - align_malloc(1000,128) will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128 and that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.
  - aligned_free(p) will free memory allocated by align_malloc.
- 16.10 Write a function called my2DAlloc which allocates a two dimensional array. Minimize the number of calls to malloc and make sure that the memory is accessible by the notation arr[i][j].
