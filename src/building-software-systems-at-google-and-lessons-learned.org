Jeff Dean @ 2010

** Outlines
- Evolution of various systems at Google
  - computing hardware
  - core search systems
  - infrastructure software
- Techniques for building large-scale systems
  - decomposition into services
  - design patterns for performance & reliability

** Google Web Search: 1999 vs. 2010
- # docs: tens of millions to tens of billions *~1000X*
- queries processed/day: *~1000X*
- per doc info in index: *~3X*
- update latency: months to tens of secs *~50000X* *这个似乎加快了不少，搜索实时性是一个很重要的问题*
- avg. query latency: <1s to <0.2s *~5X*
- More machines * faster machines: *~1000X*
- Continuous evolution:
  - 7 significant revisions in last 11 years
  - often rolled out without users realizing we’ve made major changes

*** Caching in Web Search
- Cache servers:
  - cache both index results and doc snippets
  - hit rates typically 30-60%
    - depends on frequency of index updates, mix of query traffic, level of personalization, etc
- Main benefits:
  - performance! a few machines do work of 100s or 1000s
  - much lower query latency on hits
    - queries that hit in cache tend to be both popular and expensive (common words, lots of documents to score, etc.)
- Beware: big latency spike/capacity drop when index updated or cache flushed *使用cache系统就必须注意cache挂掉时候带来的latency spike*

*** Indexing (circa 1998-1999)
- Simple batch indexing system
  - No real checkpointing, so machine failures painful 在做索引的时候没有checkpoint,所以机器故障会非常麻烦
  - No checksumming of raw data, so hardware bit errors caused problems 对于大规模数据来说，checksum还是非常必须的。
  - Exacerbated by early machines having no ECC, no parity
  - Sort 1 TB of data without parity: ends up "mostly sorted"
  - Sort it again: "mostly sorted" another way
- “Programming with adversarial memory”
  - Developed file abstraction that stores checksums of small records and can skip and resynchronize after corrupted records

*** Early 2001: In-Memory Index
- 解决index server压力的办法是通过添加更多的index replicas,但是突然有一天发现 *Eventually have enough replicas so that total memory across all index machines can hold ONE entire copy of index in memory*  replicas机器已经足够多，在内存完全可以存放下index. 然后变成如下结构
- Many positives:
  - big increase in throughput
  - big decrease in query latency
- Some issues:
  - Variance: query touches 1000s of machines, not dozens
    - *因为需要查询更多的机器，因此查询的变化也会非常大，不太容易控制差异*
    - e.g. randomized cron jobs caused us trouble for a while
  - Availability: 1 or few replicas of each doc’s index data
    - Availability of index data when machine failed (esp for important docs): replicate important docs
    - Queries of death that kill all the backends at once: very bad
    - *存在一个问题就是，一个query可能会因为system bug造成crash. 如何解决这个问题，就是下面的canary request*

*** Canary Requests
- 主要就是针对特定query会造成system crash.但是我们不希望所有的nodes都crash.
- Problem: requests sometimes cause server process to crash
  - testing can help reduce probability, but can’t eliminate
- If sending same or similar request to 1000s of machines:
  - they all might crash!
  - recovery time for 1000s of processes pretty slow
- Solution: send canary request first to one machine 可以首先将request发送到一个节点上，如果正常的话那么发送到其他节点，否则重试几次失败就放弃。
  - if RPC finishes successfully, go ahead and send to all the rest
  - if RPC fails unexpectedly, try another machine (might have just been coincidence)
  - if fails K times, reject request
- Crash only a few servers, not 1000s

*** Query Serving System, 2004 edition
我觉得这个应该是google query serving system的最终模型了。leaf所有的数据都是全内存的，但是在GFS上面有on-disk数据做持久化，或者说leaf是一个简单的query system + bigtable吧。之所有使用这种multi-level tree结构在这篇文章后面的pattern部分会说到。

*** Encodings
- Byte-Aligned Variable-length Encodings
  - 7 bits per byte with continuation bit
    - Con: Decoding requires lots of branches/shifts/masks
  - Encode byte length using 2 bits
    - Better: fewer branches, shifts, and masks
    - Con: Limited to 30-bit values, still some shifting to decode
- Group Varint Encoding
  - encode groups of 4 32-bit values in 5-17 bytes
  - Pull out 4 2-bit binary lengths into single byte prefix
  - Much faster than alternatives:
    - 7-bit-per-byte varint: decode ~180M numbers/second
    - 30-bit Varint w/ 2-bit length: decode ~240M numbers/second
    - Group varint: decode ~400M numbers/second

*** 2007: Universal Search
从多个产品整合搜索结果，但是有下面这些问题：
- Performance: most of the corpora weren’t designed to deal with high QPS level of web search 性能匹配
- Mixing: Which corpora are relevant to query? 相关性
- UI: How to organize results from different corpora? UI布局

** System Software Evolution
- The Joys of Real Hardware (Typical first year for a new cluster):
 - ~1 network rewiring (rolling ~5% of machines down over 2-day span)
 - ~20 rack failures (40-80 machines instantly disappear, 1-6 hours to get back)
 - ~5 racks go wonky (40-80 machines see 50% packetloss)
 - ~8 network maintenances (4 might cause ~30-minute random connectivity losses)
 - ~12 router reloads (takes out DNS and external vips for a couple minutes)
 - ~3 router failures (have to immediately pull traffic for an hour)
 - ~dozens of minor 30-second blips for dns
 - ~1000 individual machine failures
 - ~thousands of hard drive failures
 - slow disks, bad memory, misconfigured machines, flaky machines, etc.
 - Long distance links: wild dogs, sharks, dead horses, drunken hunters, etc.
 - *Reliability/availability must come from software!*

** System Building Experiences and Patterns
*** Many Internal Services
- Break large complex systems down into many services!
- Simpler from a software engineering standpoint
  - few dependencies, clearly specified
  - easy to test and deploy new versions of individual services
  - ability to run lots of experiments
  - easy to reimplement service without affecting clients
- Development cycles largely decoupled
  - lots of benefits: small teams can work independently
  - easier to have many engineering offices around the world
- e.g. google.com search touches 200+ services
  - ads, web search, books, news, spelling correction, ...

*** Designing Efficient Systems
- Given a basic problem definition, how do you choose "best" solution?
  - Best might be simplest, highest performance, easiest to extend, etc.
- Back of the Envelope Calculations
- Know Your Basic Building Blocks
  - Core language libraries, basic data structures, protocol buffers, GFS, BigTable, indexing systems, MapReduce, ...
  - Not just their interfaces, but understand their implementations (at least at a high level)
  - If you don’t know what’s going on, you can’t do decent back-of-the-envelope calculations!

*** Designing & Building Infrastructure
- Identify common problems, and build software systems to address them in a general way *尝试从general角度解决问题，这样才能够做出infrastructure*
- Important to not try to be all things to all people *但是对不同需求需要不同对待，不一定需要将解决方案放在一个实现里面*
  - Clients might be demanding 8 different things
  - Doing 6 of them is easy
  - ...handling 7 of them requires real thought
  - ...dealing with all 8 usually results in a worse system
  - more complex, compromises other clients in trying to satisfy everyone
- Don't build infrastructure just for its own sake: *设计通用组件的话，还需要去排除那些潜在的不需要的需求，抑制复杂性*
  - Identify common needs and address them
  - Don't imagine unlikely potential needs that aren't really there
- Best approach: use your own infrastructure (especially at first!)
  - (much more rapid feedback about what works, what doesn't)

*** Design for Growth
- Try to anticipate how requirements will evolve keep likely features in mind as you design base system
- Don’t design to scale infinitely: *扩展性只需要考虑5x-50x左右的扩展即可*
  - ~5X - 50X growth good to consider
  - >100X probably requires rethink and rewrite

*** Pattern: Single Master, 1000s of Workers
master主要完成全局性质的工作，其余工作交给worker完成。通常存在hot standby来做failover. 优点是可以很容易地进行全局控制，但是实现上必须小心，而缺点非常明显就是支撑worker不会很多，在1k级别上。如果涉及到更大规模集群的话，那么worker需要和master有更加频繁的交互，这对于master压力会非常大。

- Master orchestrates global operation of system
  - load balancing, assignment of work, reassignment when machines fail, etc.
  - ... but client interaction with master is fairly minimal
  - Often: hot standby of master waiting to take over
  - Always: bulk of data transfer directly between clients and workers
- Examples:
  - GFS, BigTable, MapReduce, file transfer service, cluster scheduling system, ...
- Pro:
  - simpler to reason about state of system with centralized master
- Caveats:
  - careful design required to keep master out of common case ops
  - scales to 1000s of workers, but not 100,000s of workers

*** Pattern: Tree Distribution of Requests
这个模型本质上是从single master模型发展过来的，是multi master实现。随着master管理worker数目增加，CPU以及network IO都会bounded. 以single master为例，如果每个master最多管理1k worker的话，那么1k master可以由另外一个master管理，这样就可以支持1k * 1k worker级别了。

- Problem: Single machine sending 1000s of RPCs overloads NIC on machine when handling replies
  - wide fan in causes TCP drops/retransmits, significant latency
  - CPU becomes bottleneck on single machine
- Solution: Use tree distribution of requests/responses
  - fan in at root is smaller
  - cost of processing leaf responses spread across many parents
- Most effective when parent processing can trim/combine leaf data
  - can also co-locate parents on same rack as leaves

*** Pattern: Backup Requests to Minimize Latency
通过backup request来降低延迟，因为部分请求可能会成为straggler，这点在mapreduce里面的speculative非常经典。 #note: jeff dean在另外一篇文章tail at scale里面也提到即便如何也存在一些bad case

- Problem: variance high when requests go to 1000s of machines
  - last few machines to respond stretch out latency tail substantially
- Often, multiple replicas can handle same kind of request
- When few tasks remaining, send backup requests to other replicas
- Whichever duplicate request finishes first wins
  - useful when variance is unrelated to specifics of request
  - increases overall load by a tiny percentage
  - decreases latency tail significantly
- Examples:
  - MapReduce backup tasks (granularity: many seconds)
  - various query serving systems (granularity: milliseconds)

*** Pattern: Multiple Smaller Units per Machine
每个机器上部署更小的单元，可以使得调度更加容易，集群资源利用率更高。

- Problems:
  - want to minimize recovery time when machine crashes
  - want to do fine-grained load balancing
- Having each machine manage 1 unit of work is inflexible
  - slow recovery: new replica must recover data that is O(machine state) in size
  - load balancing much harder
- Have each machine manage many smaller units of work/data
  - typical: ~10-100 units/machine
  - allows fine grained load balancing (shed or add one unit)
  - fast recovery from failure (N machines each pick up 1 unit)
- Examples:
  - map and reduce tasks, GFS chunks, Bigtable tablets, query serving system index shards

*** Pattern: Elastic Systems
可伸缩的系统，自动调节整个集群资源利用率。这个东西可以打个比方，如果整个集群资源空闲的话，那么可以减少线程数目，释放一些内存让其他程序可以有效运行。而当压力比较大的时候，可以保持在一个水平不至于崩溃。

- Problem: Planning for exact peak load is hard
  - overcapacity: wasted resources
  - undercapacity: meltdown
- Design system to adapt:
  - automatically shrink capacity during idle period
  - automatically grow capacity as load grows
- Make system resilient to overload:
  - do something reasonable even up to 2X planned capacity
    - e.g. shrink size of index searched, back off to less CPU intensive algorithms, drop spelling correction tips, etc.
  - more aggressive load balancing when imbalance more severe

*** Pattern: Combine Multiple Implementations
多种实现的结合，这点以realtime + batch说明非常直观。

- Example: Google web search system wants all of these:
  - freshness (update documents in ~1 second)
  - massive capacity (10000s of requests per second)
  - high quality retrieval (lots of information about each document)
  - massive size (billions of documents)
- Very difficult to accomplish in single implementation
- Partition problem into several subproblems with different engineering tradeoffs. E.g.
  - realtime system: few docs, ok to pay lots of $$$/doc
  - base system: high # of docs, optimized for low $/doc
  - realtime+base: high # of docs, fresh, low $/doc
