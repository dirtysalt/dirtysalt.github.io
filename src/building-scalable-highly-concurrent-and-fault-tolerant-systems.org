#+title: Building Scalable, Highly Concurrent & Fault-Tolerant Systems: Lessons Learned

** It's All Trade-offs
- How do I know if I have a performance problem? *If your system is slow for a single user*
- How do I know if I have a scalability problem? *If your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load*
- Latency vs Throughput *You should strive for maximal throughput with acceptable latency*
- Availability vs Consistency

** Go Concurrent
 - Shared mutable state Together with threads 线程使用共享可修改状态使得代码不稳定
   - code that is totally INDETERMINISTIC
   - and the root of all EVIL
 - The problem with locks 锁带来的问题
   - Locks do not compose 锁不能够进行组合
   - Locks breaks encapsulation 破坏封装
   - Taking too few locks
   - Taking too many locks
   - Taking the wrong locks
   - Taking locks in the wrong order 错误顺序 
   - Error recovery is hard 错误恢复处理
 - You deserve better tools *高并发更好的工具和做法*
   - Dataflow Concurrency *基于数据流的并发*
     - Deterministic
     - Declarative
     - Data-driven
- Threads are suspended until data is available 
- Lazy & On-demand
    - No difference between 
      - Concurrent &
      - Sequential code
   - Actors *轻量线程模式，传递消息方式进行通信*
     - Share NOTHING
     - Isolated lightweight event-based processes
     - Each actor has a mailbox (message queue)
     - Communicates through asynchronous and non-blocking message passing
     - Examples: Akka, Erlang
   - Software Transactional Memory (STM) *软件事务内存，更新内存是原子操作，类似DB的transaction实现*
     - See the memory as a transactional dataset
     - Similar to a database
     - Transactions are retried automatically upon collision
     - Rolls back the memory on abort
   - Agents *相当于worker角色，做一些异步操作的工作* 

** Go Fault-Tolerant
- Failure management in Java/C/C# etc *在独立的线程里面必须进行错误处理，否则外部没有办法发现错误。这样在线程里面整个错误处理贯穿于逻辑本身* 
  - You are given a SINGLE thread of control
  - If this thread blows up you are screwed
  - So you need to do all explicit error handling WITHIN this single thread
  - To make things worse - errors do not propagate between threads so there is NO WAY OF EVEN FINDING OUT that something have failed
  - This leads to DEFENSIVE programming with:
    - Error handling TANGLED with business logic
    - SCATTERED all over the code base
- The right way *正确的方式是每个线程都有独立的监控线程，所有的错误都会发送到这个监控线程，然后由这个监控线程进行处理。在语义上来说remote和local是一样的，这点可能更容易做错误控制*
  - Isolated Processes (Units of Computation)
  - Process Supervision
    - Each running process has a supervising process 
    - Errors are sent to the supervisor
    - Supervisor manages the failure
  - Same semantics local as remote
  - For example the Actor Model solves it nicely 

** Go Faster & Go More
- Never block
  - ...unless you really have to
  - Blocking kills scalability (and performance) 
  - Never sit on resources you don’t use
  - Use non-blocking IO
- Go Async
  - Use asynchronous message passing
  - Design reactive event-driven systems
  - Use push not pull or poll  #note: 可靠性是个问题
  - Don’t use explicit thread management
- How fast is fast enough?
  - Measure, measure and measure 
  - Start with a baseline
  - Define “good enough” 
  - Beware of micro-benchmarks

** Go Distributed
Werner Vogels’ Misconceptions about Reliable Distributed Computing
   1. Transparency is the ultimate goal
   2. Automatic object replication is desirable 
   3. All replicas are equal and deterministic

*Worth keeping an eye on*
- The CALM Conjecture
- Could be the future of Distributed Computing 
- Declarative
- Deterministic
- Removes TIME, i.e. the need for ordering
- Check out the *BLOOM* language

** Go Big
*** Data
- Imperative OO programming (a la Hadoop) doesn't cut it
  - Object-Mathematics Impedance Mismatch
  - We need functional processing, transformations etc.
  - Examples:Crunch/Scrunch,Cascading,Cascalog, Scalding, Scala Parallel Collections
  - Is the assembly language of MapReduce programming
  - Watch “Why Big Data Needs To Be Functional” by Dean Wampler
- Batch processing (a la Hadoop) doesn't cut it
  - We need real-time data processing
  - Examples:Spark,Storm,GridGain,Akkaetc.
*** DB
- Scaling reads to a RDBMS is hard
- Scaling writes to a RDBMS is impossible
