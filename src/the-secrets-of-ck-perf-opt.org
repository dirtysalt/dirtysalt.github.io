《The Secrets of ClickHouse Performance Optimizations》

To write fast code you just need to:

- keep in mind low-level details when designing your system;
- design based on hardware capabilities;
- choose data structures and abstractions based on the needs of the task;
- provide specializations for special cases;
- try the new, "best" algorithms, that you read about yesterday;
- choose algorithm in runtime based on statistics;
- benchmark on real datasets;
- test for performance regressions in CI;
- measure and observe everything;
- even in production environment;
- and rewrite code all the time;
