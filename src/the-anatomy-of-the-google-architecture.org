#+title: The Anatomy Of The Google Architecture
http://www.slideshare.net/hasanveldstra/the-anatomy-of-the-google-architecture-fina-lv11 @ 2009.12

** The Google Philosophy
- Jedis build their own lightsabres (the MS Eat your own Dog Food)
- Parallelize Everything
- Distribute Everything (to atomic level if possible)
- Compress Everything (CPU cheaper than bandwidth) *优化带宽*
- Secure Everything (you can never be too paranoid)
- Cache (almost) Everything
- Redundantize Everything (in triplicate usually)
- Latency is VERY evil

** The Basic Glue
file:images/the-anatomy-of-google-architecture-basic-glue.png

   1. Exterior Network (Perimeter Architecture) （外部接入层）
   2. Data Centre（数据中心）
   3. Rack Characteristics（机架设计）
   4. Core Server Hardware（硬件设计）
   5. Operating System Implementation（操作系统）
   6. Interior Network Architecture（内部网络架构）

*** Exterior Network
file:images/google-architecture-exterior-network.png

- DNS Load Balanced splits traffic (country, .com multiple DNS, other X1) to FW
- Firewall filters traffic (http/s, smtp,pop etc)
- Netscalar Load Balancers take Request from FW blocks DOS attacks, ping floods (DOS) - blocks non IPv4/6 and none 80/443 ports and http multiplexes (limited caching capability)
- User Request forwarded to Squid (Reverse Proxy) probably HUGE cache (Petabytes?)
  - 反向代理，似乎是穿透型的cache
  - 缓存命中率30-60%
  - All Image Thumbnails caches, much Multimedia cached, Expensive common queries cached 缩略图片，多媒体以及开销比较大的搜索
- If not in Cache forwarded to GWS (Custom C++ Web Server) - now not using Custom apache?
- GWS sends the Request to appropriate internal (Cell) servers

*** Data Centre
- Last estimated were 36 Data Centers, 300+ GFSII Clusters and upwards of 800K machines.（36个数据中心，300+ GFS2集群， *80万机器* ）
- US (#1) - Europe (#2) - Asia (#3) - South America/Russia (#4)
- Australia - on Hold
- Future: Taiwan, Malaysia, Lithuania, and Blythewood, South Carolina.

- Standard Google Modular DC (Cell) holds 1160 Servers / 250KW Power Consumption in 30 racks (40U).（cell有30个rack，支持40U one side.）
- A Data Centre would consist of 100s of Modular Cells.（每个数据中心最多100左右个cell)
- MDCs can also be deployed autonomously at the Perimeter (stand alone). MDC可以独立部署

*** Rack
file:images/google-architecture-rack.png

- Mini Server Size
  - Old Servers are Custom 1U
  - New Servers are 2U
  - seem 1/3 width of a normal 2U Server 宽度为普通2U服务器的1/3宽
-  40U/80U Custom Racks (50% each side)
  - Huge Heating and Power Issues（冷却系统）
  - Optimized Motherboards（主板优化）
  - Have their own HW builds（定制硬件）
- Motherboard directly mounted into Rack
  - servers have no casing - just bare boards（没有盖子）
  - assist with heat dispersal issues

*** Hardware
#note: 配置都非常普通
- 2U Low-Cost (but not slow) Commodity Servers
  - 2009 Currently 2-Way, Dual Core/16GB/1-2TB +- Standard
  - Both Intel/AMD Chipsets - 1 NIC - 2 USB
  - Looks like they RAID1/mirror the disks for better I/O - read performance
  - SATA 7.2K/10K/15K drives? 8 x 2GB DDR3 ECC
- Standard HW Build (Several HW Build Versions at any one time)
  - Currently at 7Gen Build (1G 2005 was probably Dual Core/SMP)
  - Each Server 12V Battery Backup and can run autonomously without external power (lasts 20-30s?)

| YEAR      | Average Server Specification                                                                                                |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1999/2000 | PII/PIII 128MB+                                                                                                             |
| 2003/2004 | Celeron 533, PIII 1.4 SMP, 2-4GB DRAM, Dual XEON 2.0/1-4GB/40-160GB IDE - SATA Disks via Silicon Images SATA 3114/SATA 3124 |
| 2006      | Dual Opteron/Working Set DRAM(4GB+)/2x400GB IDE (RAID0?)                                                                    |
| 2009      | 2-Way/Dual Core/16GB/1-2TB SATA                                                                                             |

*** Operating System
- 100% Redhat Linux Based since 1998 inception
  - RHEL (Why not CentOS?)
  - 2.6.X Kernel
  - PAE(Physical Address Extension) 物理地址扩展，32位下面支持64GB内存
  - Custom glibc.. rpc... ipvs...
  - Custom FS (GFS II)
  - Custom Kerberos
  - Custom NFS
  - Custom CUPS
  - Custom gPXE bootloader #note: open-source network booting software
  - Custom EVERYTHING.....
- Kernel/Subsystem Modifications
  - tcmalloc - replaces glibc 2.3 malloc - much faster! works very well with threads...
  - rpc - the rpc layer extensively modified to provide > perf increase < latency (52%/40%) #todo: ???
  - Significantly modified Kernel and Subsystems - all IPv6 enabled
  - Developed and maintained systems to automate installation, updates, and upgrades of Linux systems.
  - Served as technical lead of team responsible for customizing and deploying Linux to internal systems and workstations.
- Use Python as the primary scripting language
- Deploy Ubuntu internally (likely for the Desktop) - also Chrome OS base

*** Interior Network
Routing Protocol：
- Internal network is IPv6 (exterior machines can be reached using IPv6)
- Heavily Modified Version of OSPF as the IRP
- Intra-rack network is 100baseT
- Inter-rack network is 1000baseT
- Inter-DC network pipes unknown but very fast

Technology:
- Juniper, Cisco, Foundry, HP, routers and switches

Software:
- ipvs (ip virtual server)

** The Major Glue
file:images/the-anatomy-of-google-architecture-major-glue.png

- Google File System Architecture - GFS II
- Google Database - Bigtable
- Google Computation - Mapreduce
- Google Scheduling - GWQ

*** GOOGLE FILE SYSTEM
- GFS II “Colossus“ Version 2 improves in many ways (is a complete rewrite)
- Elegant Master Failover (no more 2s delays...) *master 2s内可以恢复*
- Chunk Size is now 1MB - likely to improve latency for serving data other than Indexing *偏向实时处理,chunksize=1MB*
- Master can store more Chunk Metadata (therefore more chunks addressable up to 100 million) = also more Chunk Servers *支持亿级别chunk*

*** GOOGLE DATABASE
- Increased Scalability (across Namespace/Datacenters)
  - Tablets spread over DC s for a table but expensive (both computationally and financially!) #note: 对于tablet跨数据中心的话代价非常大
- Multiple Bigtable Clusters replicated throughout DC 数据中心之间的bigtable集群相互同步。
- Current Status
  - Many Hundreds may be thousands of Bigtable Cells. Late 2009 stated 500 Bigtable clusters（2009年500个多个bigtable cluster)
  - At minimum scaled to many thousands of machine per cell in production 每个集群上面有上千台机器。
  - Cells manage Managing 3-figure TB data (0.X PB) 每个集群管理PB级别数据。

*** GOOGLE MAPREDUCE
- STATISTICS
  - In September 2009 Google ran 3,467,000 MR Jobs with an average 475 sec completion time averaging 488 machines per MR and utilising 25.5K Machine years
  - Technique extensively used by Yahoo with Hadoop (similar architecture to Google) and Facebook (since 06 multiple Hadoop clusters, one being 2500CPU/1PB with HBase).

*** GOOGLE WORKQUEUE
- Batch Submission/Scheduler System 批量提交和调度系统
- Arbitrates (process priorities) Schedules, Allocates Resources, process failover, Reports status, collects results 优先级分配资源，处理failover，汇报状态
- Workqueue can manage many tens of thousands of machines *管理上万机器*
- Launched via API or command line (sawzall example shown)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
saw --program code.szl --workqueue testing
--input_files /gfs/cluster1/2005-02-0[1-7]/submits.* \
--destination /gfs/cluster2/$USER/output@100
#+END_EXAMPLE

** BUILD YOUR OWN GOOGLE
file:images/the-open-source-google-stack.png

- Google PROFITS US $16M A DAY
- “Libraries are the predominant way of building programs”
- Agile Methodologies Used (development iterations, teamwork, collaboration, and process adaptability throughout the life-cycle of the project) #todo: 敏捷开发？
- An infrastructure handles versioning of applications so they can be release without a fear of breaking things = roll out with minimal QA #todo: 持续集成？
