“For those of you who think we are engaged in some sort of darwinian processes that make things better for us, it’s actually quite the opposite.” http://bit.ly/AlanKay2011

-------------------

NoSQL Technology is a step back.
- Myth1: NoSQL Technology models Applications more closely than traditional Databases.
  - Data is scattered all over NoSQL land!
  - No (simple) way to ensure various quality domains of data
    - timeliness and appropriateness
    - correctness and consistency
  - Data Integration and Data Quality assurance becomes a full-stack concern!
- Myth2: There are no transactions in NoSQL because transactions do not scale. http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/dna/papers/calvin-sigmod12.pdf
- Myth3: NoSQL Data Stores are faster.
  - Yes, they are fast. Except the other guys do their homework, too.
