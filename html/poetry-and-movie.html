<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p class="verse">
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?<br  />
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains<br  />
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways<br  />
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests<br  />
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans<br  />
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard<br  />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard<br  />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?<br  />
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it<br  />
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it<br  />
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'<br  />
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'<br  />
I saw a white ladder all covered with water<br  />
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken<br  />
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children<br  />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
And what did you hear, my darling young one?<br  />
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'<br  />
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world<br  />
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin’<br  />
Heard ten thousand whisperin’ and nobody listenin’<br  />
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'<br  />
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter<br  />
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley<br  />
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Who did you meet, my darling young one?<br  />
I met a young child beside a dead pony<br  />
I met a white man who walked a black dog<br  />
I met a young woman whose body was burning<br  />
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow<br  />
I met one man who was wounded in love<br  />
I met another man who was wounded with hatred<br  />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />
<br  />
Oh, what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?<br  />
Oh, what'll you do now, my darling young one?<br  />
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'<br  />
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest<br  />
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty<br  />
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters<br  />
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison<br  />
Where the executioner's face is always well-hidden<br  />
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten<br  />
Where black is the color, where none is the number<br  />
And I'll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it<br  />
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it<br  />
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'<br  />
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'<br  />
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard<br  />
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall<br  />

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p class="verse">
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand<br  />
Vanished from my hand<br  />
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping<br  />
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet<br  />
I have no one to meet<br  />
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship<br  />
My senses have been stripped<br  />
My hands can't feel to grip<br  />
My toes too numb to step<br  />
Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering<br  />
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade<br  />
Into my own parade<br  />
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun<br  />
It's not aimed at anyone<br  />
It's just escaping on the run<br  />
And but for the sky there are no fences facing<br  />
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme<br  />
To your tambourine in time<br  />
It's just a ragged clown behind<br  />
I wouldn't pay it any mind<br  />
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you<br  />
<br  />
And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind<br  />
Down the foggy ruins of time<br  />
Far past the frozen leaves<br  />
The haunted frightened trees<br  />
Out to the windy beach<br  />
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow<br  />
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky<br  />
With one hand waving free<br  />
Silhouetted by the sea<br  />
Circled by the circus sands<br  />
With all memory and fate<br  />
Driven deep beneath the waves<br  />
Let me forget about today until tomorrow<br  />
<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to<br  />
Hey! Mr. Tambourine man, play a song for me<br  />

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Desolation Row (Bob Dylan)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p class="verse">
They’re selling postcards of the hanging<br  />
They’re painting the passports brown<br  />
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors<br  />
The circus is in town<br  />
Here comes the blind commissioner<br  />
They’ve got him in a trance<br  />
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker<br  />
The other is in his pants<br  />
And the riot squad they’re restless<br  />
They need somewhere to go<br  />
As Lady and I look out tonight<br  />
From Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Cinderella, she seems so easy<br  />
“It takes one to know one,” she smiles<br  />
And puts her hands in her back pockets<br  />
Bette Davis style<br  />
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning<br  />
“You Belong to Me I Believe”<br  />
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend<br  />
You better leave”<br  />
And the only sound that’s left<br  />
After the ambulances go<br  />
Is Cinderella sweeping up<br  />
On Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Now the moon is almost hidden<br  />
The stars are beginning to hide<br  />
The fortune-telling lady<br  />
Has even taken all her things inside<br  />
All except for Cain and Abel<br  />
And the hunchback of Notre Dame<br  />
Everybody is making love<br  />
Or else expecting rain<br  />
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing<br  />
He’s getting ready for the show<br  />
He’s going to the carnival tonight<br  />
On Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Now Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window<br  />
For her I feel so afraid<br  />
On her twenty-second birthday<br  />
She already is an old maid<br  />
To her, death is quite romantic<br  />
She wears an iron vest<br  />
Her profession’s her religion<br  />
Her sin is her lifelessness<br  />
And though her eyes are fixed upon<br  />
Noah’s great rainbow<br  />
She spends her time peeking<br  />
Into Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood<br  />
With his memories in a trunk<br  />
Passed this way an hour ago<br  />
With his friend, a jealous monk<br  />
He looked so immaculately frightful<br  />
As he bummed a cigarette<br  />
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes<br  />
And reciting the alphabet<br  />
Now you would not think to look at him<br  />
But he was famous long ago<br  />
For playing the electric violin<br  />
On Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world<br  />
Inside of a leather cup<br  />
But all his sexless patients<br  />
They’re trying to blow it up<br  />
Now his nurse, some local loser<br  />
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole<br  />
And she also keeps the cards that read<br  />
“Have Mercy on His Soul”<br  />
They all play on pennywhistles<br  />
You can hear them blow<br  />
If you lean your head out far enough<br  />
From Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains<br  />
They’re getting ready for the feast<br  />
The Phantom of the Opera<br  />
A perfect image of a priest<br  />
They’re spoonfeeding Casanova<br  />
To get him to feel more assured<br  />
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence<br  />
After poisoning him with words<br  />
And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls<br  />
“Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know<br  />
Casanova is just being punished for going<br  />
To Desolation Row”<br  />
<br  />
Now at midnight all the agents<br  />
And the superhuman crew<br  />
Come out and round up everyone<br  />
That knows more than they do<br  />
Then they bring them to the factory<br  />
Where the heart-attack machine<br  />
Is strapped across their shoulders<br  />
And then the kerosene<br  />
Is brought down from the castles<br  />
By insurance men who go<br  />
Check to see that nobody is escaping<br  />
To Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Praise be to Nero’s Neptune<br  />
The Titanic sails at dawn<br  />
And everybody’s shouting<br  />
“Which Side Are You On?”<br  />
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot<br  />
Fighting in the captain’s tower<br  />
While calypso singers laugh at them<br  />
And fishermen hold flowers<br  />
Between the windows of the sea<br  />
Where lovely mermaids flow<br  />
And nobody has to think too much<br  />
About Desolation Row<br  />
<br  />
Yes, I received your letter yesterday<br  />
(About the time the doorknob broke)<br  />
When you asked how I was doing<br  />
Was that some kind of joke?<br  />
All these people that you mention<br  />
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame<br  />
I had to rearrange their faces<br  />
And give them all another name<br  />
Right now I can’t read too good<br  />
Don’t send me no more letters, no<br  />
Not unless you mail them<br  />
From Desolation Row<br  />

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold（有一位姑娘她相信闪光的都是金子）<br  />
And she's buying a stairway to heaven（她想买一架通往天堂的阶梯）<br  />
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed（她明白即使商店都已关门）<br  />
With a word she can get what she came for（只要轻启朱唇她就能得到所要的东西）<br  />
Ooh ooh and she's buying a stairway to heaven（她想买一架通往天堂的阶梯）<br  />
<br  />
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure（墙上分明有告示但她却想打听确实）<br  />
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings（因为你知道有些词一语双关）<br  />
In a tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings（在溪边的树上有只鸟儿在歌唱）<br  />

Then the piper will lead us to reason（吹笛人会为我们指点迷津）<br  />
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long（新的一天为那些坚守许久的人们而破晓）<br  />

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow don't be alarmed now（别惊慌如果灌木中传来喧嚷）<br  />
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen（那只是为五月皇后而做的春季扫除）<br  />
Yes there are two paths you can go by（有两条路你可以选择）<br  />
But in the long run（然而长远点说）<br  />
There's still time to change the road you're on（你仍有机会改变现在的路）<br  />

莫那·鲁道：“十五岁那年，我第一次出草，我也紧张胆怯、手脚发抖，但是我的眼神如箭！挥下敌人首级的瞬间，我忘记了什么叫做害怕，因为我知道我将作为勇士回到部落参加欢庆的酒宴，因为我知道从今以后部落里的男女老少都将尊敬我的勇猛！可是这次不一样！今天我们虽然成功血祭祖灵，取得了走过彩虹桥的资格，但是我门接下来要面对的不是酒宴的欢庆，而是选择死亡的方式！早在起事之前你们就知道这种结果了，不是吗！孩子们，别急着害怕！你们今天表现得很勇猛，祖灵们一定都看到了。但接下来要面对的才是真正的战斗，是要让异族人吓破肝胆的战斗！森林的祖灵鸟正驱赶着吃腐肉的乌鸦，水汽后的阳光只会让彩虹更加艳丽。孩子们啊，不要害怕，祖灵会肯定我们是守护猎场的好战士，你们手上的血痕就是印记，你们已经是赛德克巴莱了！！记住，一定要保持骄傲！我们要一起通过彩虹桥！”

Makers of men, creators of leaders, be careful what kind of leaders you’re producin’ here. I don’t know if Charlie’s silence here today is right or wrong, I’m not a judge or jury, but I can tell you this: he won’t sell anybody out to buy his future! And that my friends is called integrity, that’s called courage. Now, that’s the stuff leaders should be made of. Now I have come to crossroads in my life, I always knew what the right path was. Without exception, I knew, but I never took it, you know why, it was too damn hard. Now here’s Charlie, he’s come to the crossroads, he has chosen a path. It’s the right path, it’s a path made of principle that leads to character. Let him continue on his journey. You hold this boy’s future in your hands, committee, it’s a valuable future, believe me. Don’t destroy it, protect it. Embrace it. It’s gonna make you proud one day, I promise you.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: the magician shows you something ordinary, but of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn. The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secret&#x2026;you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.
</p>

<p>
每一项伟大魔术的完成，都与三个过程密不可分：一为“验证”，魔术师展示了看似平常、实则已经动过手脚的表演道具；二为“转移”，魔术师手中看似普通的事物，瞬间变得与众不同，这个时候，如果你想找魔术背后的秘密……那几乎是不可能的，这也是为什么还会有第三步；三为“蒙蔽”，这也是魔术中最关键的环节，是魔术师利用技巧进行掩饰的过程，一旦达成某种平衡，就会产生那种前所未见、让你无比震惊的现象&#x2013;也就是魔术。

没错，我可能被炒掉。那样的话，我44岁只有高中学历，还很想送女儿上大学。而你才二十五岁，耶鲁大学毕业，还有很漂亮的见习履历。我想我们没有说到点子上，我们应该思考的问题是，你到底信不信我们会成功？你觉得我们还有必要向别人解释？不必，向任何人解释。

不，伙计，我可没付你七百万，洋基队付了你一般薪水。他们认为你就值那么多，他们付你三百五十万与他们对打。大卫，你已经三十七岁了，你我为何不开诚布公各取所需呢？我想榨干你最后一点棒球能力，你想继续留在赛场上。我付你薪水不是因为你以前的名声，而是你目前的能力。你很聪明，知道我们努力的目标，给年轻球员做个榜样，做个领袖。
</p>

<p>
你用四千一百万打造了一支打进季后赛的球队，没有Damon, Giambi, Isringhausen, Pena, 没有了他们，你还赢得了更多的比赛。你赢的场次和洋基队一样多，但是洋基队每赢一场花费一百四十万，你只用二十六万。我知道你不同意我的想法，但是第一个敢于打破陈规的人，必定会碰得头破血流。这是必然的，这不但威胁到他们的经营方式，他们的思维，还威胁到了比赛，真正受到威胁的是他们的生活和工作，威胁到他们的处世之道。每次发生这种事情，无论是一个政府，还是一种经营方式，无论主体是什么，那些大权在握掌控全局的人，都抓狂了。无论是哪个球队的经理，如果现在还不拆散自己的队伍，再按照你的模式重建，他们就是老顽固。到十月，他们就会坐在沙发上，眼睁睁地看着Boston Red Sox赢得世界职业棒球大赛。
