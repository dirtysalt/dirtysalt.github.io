<p>
前面很长的篇幅介绍了他和当前火热的深度学习之间的关系，我不是特别感兴趣。反倒是觉得他的求学经历很有意思，以及在70-80年代一片对神经网络看衰的环境下面依然坚持着。
</p>

<p>
Born in Wimbledon and raised in Bristol, England, Prof. Hinton's mother was a math teacher and his father was an entomologist with a fondness for beetles. His great-great-grandfather was 19th-century logician George Boole, the inventor of Boolean algebra, a foundation of modern computing. Prof. Hinton attended what he described as a second-tier private school (called a public school in Britain): "I wasn't particularly good at math at school. I liked physics. And soccer."
</p>

<p>
He went to the University of Cambridge for physics and chemistry but only lasted a month, dropping out and switching to architecture, where he said he only lasted a day. He re-enrolled in physics and physiology but found the math in physics too tough and so switched to philosophy, cramming two years into one.
</p>

<p>
"That was a very useful year, because I developed very strong antibodies against philosophy," Prof. Hinton said. "I wanted to understand how the mind worked."
</p>

<p>
To that end, he switched to psychology, only to decide "that psychologists didn't have a clue." He spent a year as a carpenter before heading to graduate school at the University of Edinburgh in 1973 to study artificial intelligence under Christopher Longuet-Higgins, whose students included Nobel Prize winners John Polanyi, the U of T chemist, and theoretical physicist Peter Higgs.
</p>

<p>
Even then Prof. Hinton was convinced that the discredited neural-net concept was the way forward. But his supervisor had recently converted to the traditional AI camp.
</p>

<p>
"I had a stormy graduate career, where every week we would have a shouting match," Prof. Hinton said. "I kept doing deals where I would say, 'Okay let me do neural nets for another six months and I will prove to you they work.' At the end of the six months, I would say, 'Yeah, but I am almost there, give me another six months.' And since then I have been saying, 'Give me another five years,' and people have been saying, 'You have been doing it these five years, this never worked.' And finally, it worked."
</p>

<p>
He denies ever doubting that neural nets would one day be proven superior: "I never had doubts, because the brain's got to work somehow. The brain sure as hell doesn't work by somebody programming in rules."
