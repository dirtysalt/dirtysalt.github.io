文中很多词汇都不太懂。大致有这么几点：

<p>
不要将焦点放在如何获得快乐这个目的上，而更应该关注过程和你关心的事情上。

<blockquote>
<p>
Mill’s first conclusion was that happiness is a side-effect, not a goal you can achieve directly, nor verify directly by rational self-interrogation. Whenever you ask yourself “can I prove that I’m happy?” the self-consciousness involved will make the answer be “no”. Instead of choosing happiness as your goal, you need to focus on some other thing you care about:

<p>
It’s worth noticing that Mill is suggesting focusing on something you actually care about. If you’re spending your time working on something that meaningless to you, you will probably have a harder time of it.

做事情之前不能计较太多或者说过分思考。过分思考可以制定严密的计划，但是却也容易产生恐惧降低兴趣。
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
On the one hand, rational logical thought is immensely useful in understanding the world: “it enables us mentally to separate ideas which have only casually clung together”. But this ability to analyze also has its costs, since “the habit of analysis has a tendency to wear away the feelings”. In particular, analysis “fearfully undermine all desires, and all pleasures”.
</p>

<p>

Mill’s second conclusion was that logical thought and analysis are not enough on their own. He still believed in the value of “intellectual culture”, but he also aimed to become a more balanced person by “the cultivation of the feelings”. And in particular, he learned the value of “poetry and art as instruments of human culture”.
</p>

<p>
Both nature and art cultivate the feelings, an additional and distinct way of being human beyond logical analysis:

总结下来就是:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Aim in your work not for happiness, but for a goal you care about: improving the world, or even just applying and honing a skill you value.</li>
<li>Your work—and the rational thought it entails—will not suffice to make you happy; rational thought on its own will undermine your feelings.</li>
<li>You should therefore also cultivate your feelings: through nature, and through art.</li>
