Six Advantages of Cloud Computing 6个使用云计算的优势
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Trade capital expense for variable expense. Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.（按需付费而不用在早期过度投资于数据中心建设）
</li>
<li>Benefit from massive economies of scale. By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.（利用集群的规模经济）
</li>
<li>Stop guessing about capacity.Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice. （避免猜测容量）
</li>
<li>Increase speed and agility. In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.（各种升级和部署都更加简单快速）
</li>
<li>Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers. Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.（免去后期维护数据中心的成本）
</li>
<li>Go global in minutes. Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.（利用AWS集群全球化的优势）
</li>
</ul>

Region和AZ的差别。一个Region里面可能有多个AZ，这些AZ在硬件和软件层面都是分开的，但是AZs之间都是通过高速网络互连的。AWS提供的很多产品默认在AZs之间做replication, 至于cross-region replication则是可选的，因为延迟和吞吐通常不太好控制。
</p>

<p>
AWS is available in multiple locations worldwide. These locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. A region is a named set of AWS resources in the same separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones. AWS enables the placement of resources, such as instances, and data in multiple locations. Resources aren't replicated across regions unless you chose to do so.
</p>

<p>
Each region is completely independent and is designed to be completely isolated from the other regions. This achieves the greatest possible fault tolerance and stability. Each Availability Zone is isolated, but the Availability Zones in a region are connected through low-latency links. Availability Zones are physically separated within a typical metropolitan region and are located in lower risk flood plains (specific flood zone categorization varies by region). In addition to utilizing discrete uninterruptable power supply (UPS) and onsite backup generators, they are each fed via different grids from independent utilities to further reduce single points of failure. Availability Zones are all redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers.

Key Considerations When Using AWS for Web Hosting 将应用上云需要注意的事情
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No More Physical Network Appliances. You cannot deploy physical network appliances in AWS. For example, firewalls, routers, and load balancers for your AWS applications can no longer reside on physical devices but must be replaced with software solutions. There is a wide variety of enterprise-quality software solutions, whether for load balancing (e.g., Zeus, HAProxy, NGINX Plus, and Pound) or establishing a VPN connection (e.g., OpenVPN, OpenSwan, and Vyatta). This is not a limitation of what can be run on the AWS Cloud, but it is an architectural change to your application if you use these devices today. （没有任何物理网络设施。原来一些需要物理设备实现的策略都需要切换到软件上来。AWS在这层将很多硬件功能标准化）
</li>
<li>Firewalls Everywhere. Where you once had a simple DMZ and then open communications among your hosts in a traditional hosting model, AWS enforces a more secure model, in which every host is locked down. One of the steps in planning an AWS deployment is the analysis of traffic between hosts. This analysis will guide decisions on exactly what ports need to be opened. You can create security groups within Amazon EC2 for each type of host in your architecture. In addition, you can create a large variety of simple and tiered security models to enable the minimum access among hosts within your architecture. The use of network access control lists within Amazon VPC can help lock down your network at the subnet level.（防火墙无处不在，默认来说所有的机器都只提供最基本的访问权限，用户需要配置SG或者是VPC）
</li>
<li>Consider the Availability of Multiple Data Centers. Think of Availability Zones within an AWS Region as multiple data centers. EC2 instances in different Availability Zones are both logically and physically separated, and they provide an easy-to-use model for deploying your application across data centers for both high availability and reliability. Amazon VPC as a regional service allows you to leverage Availability Zones while keeping all of your resources in the same logical network.（利用Multiple AZ来实现高可用性）
</li>
<li>Treat Hosts as Ephemeral and Dynamic. Probably the most important shift in how you might architect your AWS application is that Amazon EC2 hosts should be considered ephemeral and dynamic. Any application built for the AWS Cloud should not assume that a host will always be available and should be designed with the knowledge that any data that is not on an EBS volume will be lost if an EC2 instance fails. Additionally, when a new host is brought up, you shouldn’t make assumptions about the IP address or location within an Availability Zone of the host. Your configuration model must be flexible, and your approach to bootstrapping a host must take the dynamic nature of the cloud into account. These techniques are critical for building and running a highly scalable and fault-tolerant application.（需要假设所有的机器都是临时的和动态的，但是AWS也提供了足够的灵活性来应对这些问题，比如EBS和EIP等）
</li>
<li>Consider a Serverless Architecture. This whitepaper primarily focuses on a more traditional web architecture. However, newer services like AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway enable you to build a more serverless web application that abstracts away the use of virtual machines to perform compute. In these cases, code is executed on a request-by-request basis, and you pay only for the number of requests and the length of requests. You can find out more about serverless architectures here.（AWS看来还是鼓励serverless架构）
