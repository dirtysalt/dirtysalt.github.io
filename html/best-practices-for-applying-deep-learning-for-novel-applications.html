Understanding what is happening in your model will affect the success of your project. Carpenters have an expression “measure twice, cut once”. You should think “code once, measure twice”. In addition to evaluating the output, you should visualize your architecture and measure internal entities to understand why you are getting the results you are obtaining. Without diagnostics, you will be shooting in the dark to fix problems or improve performance.
