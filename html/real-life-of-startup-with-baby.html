lean in 没有想象的那么容易.

I can see now the specific obstacles of leaning in, and they cannot be overcome by myself. Siobhan is the driving force behind our product and is responsible for giving my career the jumpstart it needed. She can see past the “liabilities” of doctors appointments and last-minute scrambles for childcare. She sees that being a parent makes you take care of business in a serious way. Motivation, organization, and no room for BS. That’s how you parent and that’s how you run a company. # 有娃的人通常会更加严肃地看待工作，自我驱动，更加自律。
