两种不同的release方式
</p>

<p>
There are two ways you can go about releasing open source software. The first is to "go big", build a lot of hype for the project, and then get as much exposure as possible on release. This approach can be risky though, since if the quality isn't there or you mess up the messaging, you will alienate a huge number of people to the project on day one. That could kill any chance the project had to be successful.
</p>

<p>
The second approach is to quietly release the code and let the software slowly gain adoption. This avoids the risks of the first approach, but it has its own risk of people viewing the project as insignificant and ignoring it.
</p>

<p>
I decided to go with the first approach. I knew I had a very high quality, very useful piece of software, and through my experience with my first open source project Cascalog, I was confident I could get the messaging right.

尽可能多地建立social proof. 但是尽管如此还是有很多反馈没有获取到
</p>

<p>
A key issue you have to deal with to get adoption for a project is building social proof. Social proof exists in many forms: documented real-world usage of the project, Github watchers, mailing list activity, mailing list subscribers, Twitter followers, blog posts about the project, etc.
</p>

<p>
I set up a "Powered By" page for Storm to get that last piece of critical social proof going. Rather than just have a list of companies, I requested that everyone who listed themselves on that page include a short paragraph about how they're using it. This allows people reading that page to get a sense of the variety of use cases and scales that Storm can be used for. I included a link to my email on that page for people who wanted to be listed on it. As I did the tech talk circuit, that page continued to grow and grow.
</p>

<p>
Filling the "Powered By" page for a project can be frustrating, as there can be a lot of people using your project that you're not aware of. I remember one time I got an email from one of the biggest Chinese companies in the world asking to be listed on Storm's Powered By page. They had been using Storm for over a year at that point, but that whole time I had no idea. To this day I don't know the best way to get people to tell you they're using your software. Besides the link to my email on Storm's Powered By page, the technique I've used is to occasionally solicit Powered By submissions via Twitter and the mailing list.

"visonary-driven" development 优势和劣势
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>控制代码质量，设计上更加统一
</li>
<li>限制其他人的贡献，并且决策者成为单点。也容易对自己造成很大压力
</li>
</ul>
<p>
和"consensus-driven" development相比，比较适合用在项目初期很多方案都还不太确定的时候
</p>

<p>
The hardest part about building an open source project is building the community of developers contributing to the project. This is definitely something I struggled with.
</p>

<p>
For the first 1.5 years after release, I drove all development of Storm. All changes to the project went through me. There were pros and cons to having all development centered on me.
</p>

<p>
By controlling every detail of the project, I could ensure the project remained at a very high quality. Since I knew the project from top to bottom, I could anticipate all the ways any given change would affect the project as a whole. And since I had a vision of where the project should go, I could prevent any changes from going in that conflicted with that vision (or modify them to be consistent). I could ensure the project always had a consistent design and experience.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, "visionary-driven development" has a major drawback in that it makes it very hard to build an active and enthusiastic development community. First off, there's very little room for anyone to come in and make major contributions, since I am controlling everything. Second, I am a major bottleneck in all development. It became very, very hard to keep up with pull requests coming in (remember, I was also building a brand new infrastructure team within Twitter at the same time). So people would get discouraged from contributing to the project due to the incredibly slow feedback/merge cycle.
</p>

<p>
Another drawback to centering development on myself was that people viewed me as a single point of failure for the project. People brought up concerns to me of what would happen if I got hit by a bus. This concern actually limited the project less than you would think, as Storm was adopted by tons of major companies while I was at the center of development, including Yahoo!, Groupon, The Weather Channel, WebMD, Cerner, Alibaba, Baidu, Taobao, and many other companies.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the worst aspect to centering development on myself was the burden I personally felt. It's a ton of pressure and makes it hard to take a break. However, I was hesitant to expand control over project development to others because I was worried about project quality suffering. There was no way anyone else would have the deep understanding I did of the entire code base, and inevitably that would lead to changes going in with unintended consequences. However, I began to realize that this is something you have to accept when expanding a developer community. And later on I would realize this isn't as big of a deal as I thought.
</p>

<p>
To put it another way, I think "visionary-driven development" is necessary when the solution space still has a lot of uncertainty in it. When the solution space is relatively well understood, the value of "visionary-driven development" diminishes dramatically. Then having that one person as a bottleneck seriously inhibits growth of the project.
