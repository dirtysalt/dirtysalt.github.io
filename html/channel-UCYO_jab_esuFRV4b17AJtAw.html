What about all the lighthouses on the far end?  Well, a more careful calculation will show that the contributions from those lights become more negligible.  In fact, the contributions from almost all lights become negligible.  For the ambitious among you, see this paper for full details.</br></br>If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then "add subtitles/cc".

If this doesn't blow your mind, I don't know what will.</br>Part 2: https://youtu.be/jsYwFizhncE</br>Part 3: https://youtu.be/brU5yLm9DZM</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/clacks-thanks</br></br>New to this channel?  It's all about teaching math visually.  Take a look and see if there's anything you'd like to learn.</br></br>NY Times blog post about this problem:</br>https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/</br></br>The original paper by Gregory Galperin:</br>https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf</br></br>Evidently, Numberphile also described this problem (I had not known):</br>https://youtu.be/abv4Fz7oNr0</br>You'll notice that video has an added factor of 16 throughout, which is not here.  That's because they're only counting the collisions between blocks (well, balls in their case), and they're only counting to the point where the big block starts moving the other way.</br></br>------------------</br></br>These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim</br></br>If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.</br></br>Music by Vincent Rubinetti.</br>Download the music on Bandcamp:</br>https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown</br></br>Stream the music on Spotify:</br>https://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u</br></br>If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then "add subtitles/cc".

I loved it!  Y'all are the best.  Here are just two of my favorites.</br>By a channel STEM cell: https://youtu.be/ils7GZqp_iE</br>By Doga Kurkcuoglu: http://bilimneguzellan.net/bouncing-cubes-and-%CF%80-3blue1brown/</br></br>And here's a lovely interactive built by GitHub user prajwalsouza after watching this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html</br></br>NY Times blog post about this problem:</br>https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/</br></br>The original paper by Gregory Galperin:</br>https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf</br></br>For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.</br></br>Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.</br></br>If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then "add subtitles/cc".

I loved it!  Y'all are the best.  Here are just two of my favorites.</br>By a channel STEM cell: https://youtu.be/ils7GZqp_iE</br>By Doga Kurkcuoglu: http://bilimneguzellan.net/bouncing-cubes-and-%CF%80-3blue1brown/</br></br>And here's a lovely interactive built by GitHub user prajwalsouza after watching this video: https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html</br></br>NY Times blog post about this problem:</br>https://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/pi/</br></br>The original paper by Gregory Galperin:</br>https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf</br></br>For anyone curious about if the tan(x) ≈ x approximation, being off by only a cubic error term, is actually close enough not to affect the final count, take a look at sections 9 and 10 of Galperin's paper.  In short, it could break if there were some point where among the first 2N digits of pi, the last N of them were all 9's.  This seems exceedingly unlikely, but it quite hard to disprove.</br></br>Although I found the approach shown in this video independently, after the fact I found that Gary Antonick, who wrote the Numberplay blog referenced above, was the first to solve it this way.  In some ways, I think this is the most natural approach one might take given the problem statement, as corroborated by the fact that many solutions people sent my way in this last week had this flavor.  The Galperin solution you will see in the next video, though, involves a wonderfully creative perspective.</br></br>If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then "add subtitles/cc".

The math of superposition and quantum states.</br>minutephysics channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/light-quantum-thanks</br>And by Brilliant: https://brilliant.org/3b1b</br></br>Huge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.</br></br>This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.</br></br>I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at http://3b1b.co/essence-of-linear-algebra</br></br>Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!</br></br>*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.</br></br>What's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.</br></br>Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.</br></br>Music by Vincent Rubinetti:</br>https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown</br></br>------------------</br></br>3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is just one specific example of a much more general, relatable, non-quantum phenomenon.</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/uncertainty-thanks</br>And by Art of Problem Solving: http://aops.com/3b1b</br></br>For more on quantum mechanical wave functions, I highly recommend this video by udiprod:</br>https://youtu.be/p7bzE1E5PMY</br></br>Minute physics on special relativity:</br>https://youtu.be/1rLWVZVWfdY</br></br>Main video on the Fourier transform</br>https://youtu.be/spUNpyF58BY</br></br>Louis de Broglie thesis: </br>http://aflb.ensmp.fr/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf</br></br>More on Doppler radar:</br>Radar basics: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1278808</br></br>There's a key way in which the description I gave of the trade-off in Doppler radar differs from reality.  Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  </br></br>This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.  See the above article for more information.</br></br>Music by Vincent Rubinetti: </br>https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown</br></br>------------------</br></br>3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

Some mathematical order amidst the chaos of turbulence.</br>Vortex rings with Physics Girl: https://youtu.be/N7d_RWyOv20</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/turbulence-thanks</br>Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com</br></br>Thanks to Dan Walsh for many great ideas, and thanks to Mike Hansen for many helpful conversations.</br></br>Error correction: I meant to describe Kolmogorov as a “20th-century mathematician” not “19th-century”.  Whoops!  I think during the narration I must have made the classic 1900s vs. 19th-century mix up.  Anyone aware of his work is more than aware of what century he lived in, which apparently applies to quite a few commenters.</br></br>And while we're here, the animation at 9:55 misleadingly has the vortex kind of speed up during the transition, which it should not do.  Really, the velocity scales of eddies decreases for lower length scales.</br></br>Introduction to turbulence:</br>http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~ryden/ast825/ch7.pdf</br></br>More details on vortex stretching:</br>https://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/tabak/vorticity.pdf</br></br>Video on NightHawkInLight with a similar demo:</br>https://youtu.be/K94Cc21KEIA</br></br>Music by Vincent Rubinetti: </br>https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown</br></br>------------------</br></br>3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

The math of superposition and quantum states.</br>minutephysics channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/light-quantum-thanks</br>And by Brilliant: https://brilliant.org/3b1b</br></br>Huge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.</br></br>This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.</br></br>I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at http://3b1b.co/essence-of-linear-algebra</br></br>Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!</br></br>*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.</br></br>What's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.</br></br>Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.</br></br>Music by Vincent Rubinetti:</br>https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown</br></br>------------------</br></br>3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

An explanation of fractal dimension.</br>Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/fractals-thanks</br>And by Affirm: https://www.affirm.com/</br></br>Music by Vince Rubinetti: https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/riemann-zeta-function</br></br>One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).</br></br>The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose "Hausdorff dimension" is greater than its "topological dimension".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  </br></br>Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.</br></br>See Mandelbrot's book "The Fractal Geometry of Nature" for the full details and more examples.</br></br>------------------</br>3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

Since the speed of light is so drastically greater than the speed of things being detected, the Fourier representation for pulse echoes of different objects would almost certainly overlap unless it was played for a very long time.  In effect, this is what happens, since one does not send out a single pulse, but a whole bunch of evenly spaced pulses as some pulse repetition frequency (or PRF).  </br></br>This means the Fourier representation of all those pulses together can actually be quite sharp.  Assuming a large number of such pulses, it will look like several vertical lines spaced out by the PRF.  As long as the pulses are far enough apart that the echoes of multiple objects on the field from different targets don't overlap, it's not a problem for position determinations that the full sequence of pulses occupies such a long duration.  However, the trade-off now comes in choosing the right PRF.

Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!</br></br>For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy</br></br>There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!</br>https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning</br></br>I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/</br></br>For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: </br>https://youtu.be/i8D90DkCLhI</br>https://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs</br></br>For those of you looking to go *even* deeper, check out the text "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  </br></br>Also, the publication Distill is just utterly beautiful: https://distill.pub/</br></br>Lion photo by Kevin Pluck</br></br>------------------</br>Animations largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim</br></br>If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.</br></br>Music by Vincent Rubinetti.</br>Download the music on Bandcamp:</br>https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown</br></br>Stream the music on Spotify:</br>https://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u</br></br>If you want to contribute translated subtitles or to help review those that have already been made by others and need approval, you can click the gear icon in the video and go to subtitles/cc, then "add subtitles/cc".

If it's guessing a private key, you are correct, but for something like guessing which input to a hash function gives the desired output (as in bitcoin mining, for example), which is the kind of thing I had in mind here, 2^256 would indeed be the average number of attempts needed, at least for a true cryptographic hash function.

An explanation of fractal dimension.</br>Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com/</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/fractals-thanks</br>And by Affirm: https://www.affirm.com/</br></br>Music by Vince Rubinetti: https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/riemann-zeta-function</br></br>One technical note: It's possible to have fractals with an integer dimension.  The example to have in mind is some *very* rough curve, which just so happens to achieve roughness level exactly 2.  Slightly rough might be around 1.1-dimension; quite rough could be 1.5; but a very rough curve could get up to 2.0 (or more).  A classic example of this is the boundary of the Mandelbrot set.  The Sierpinski pyramid also has dimension 2 (try computing it!).</br></br>The proper definition of a fractal, at least as Mandelbrot wrote it, is a shape whose "Hausdorff dimension" is greater than its "topological dimension".  Hausdorff dimension is similar to the box-counting one I showed in this video, in some sense counting using balls instead of boxes, and it coincides with box-counting dimension in many cases. But it's more general, at the cost of being a bit harder to describe.  </br></br>Topological dimension is something that's always an integer, wherein (loosely speaking) curve-ish things are 1-dimensional, surface-ish things are two-dimensional, etc.  For example, a Koch Curve has topological dimension 1, and Hausdorff dimension 1.262.  A rough surface might have topological dimension 2, but fractal dimension  2.3.  And if a curve with topological dimension 1 has a Hausdorff dimension that *happens* to be exactly 2, or 3, or 4, etc., it would be considered a fractal, even though it's fractal dimension is an integer.</br></br>See Mandelbrot's book "The Fractal Geometry of Nature" for the full details and more examples.</br></br>------------------</br>3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.

The math of superposition and quantum states.</br>minutephysics channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics</br>Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/light-quantum-thanks</br>And by Brilliant: https://brilliant.org/3b1b</br></br>Huge thanks to my friend Evan Miyazono, both for encouraging me to do this project, and for helping me understand many things along the way.</br></br>This is a simple primer for how the math of quantum mechanics, specifically in the context of polarized light, relates to the math of classical waves, specifically classical electromagnetic waves.</br></br>I will say, if you *do* want to go off and learn the math of quantum mechanics, you just can never have too much linear algebra, so check out the series I did at http://3b1b.co/essence-of-linear-algebra</br></br>Mistakes: As several astute commenters have pointed out, the force arrow is pointing the wrong way at 2:18.  Thanks for the catch!</br></br>*Note on conventions:  Throughout this video, I use a single-headed right arrow to represent the horizontal direction.  The standard in quantum mechanics is actually to use double-headed arrows for describing polarization states, while single-headed arrows are typically reserved for the context of spin.</br></br>What's the difference?  Well, using a double-headed arrow to represent the horizontal direction emphasizes that in a quantum mechanical context, there's no distinction between left and right.  They each have the same measurable state: horizontal (e.g. they pass through horizontally oriented filters).  Once you're in QM, these kets are typically vectors in a more abstract space where vectors are not necessarily spatial directions but instead represent any kind of state.</br></br>Because of how I chose to motivate things with classical waves, where it makes sense for this arrow to represent a unit vector in the right direction, rather than the more abstract idea of a horizontal state vector, I chose to stick with the single-headed notation throughout, though this runs slightly against convention.</br></br>Music by Vincent Rubinetti:</br>https://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown</br></br>------------------</br></br>3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
