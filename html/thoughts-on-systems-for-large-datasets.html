<h1 class="title">Thoughts on Systems for Large Datasets: Problems and Opportunities</h1>
<p>
感觉从2012年之后，jeff工作开始从构建分布式数据库系统，转向构建机器学习和深度学习的分布式系统。这篇presentation后半部分谈到了如何从大量数据，尤其是大量的非结构化的互联网数据里面，找到有价值的信息(通过deep learning)
</p>

<p>
Areas I Wish New Grads Knew More About
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ability to do back-of-the-envelope calculations and quickly evaluate many alternative designs</li>
<li>Understanding the importance of locality at all levels (caches &amp; memory systems, disk I/O, cross-machine, geographic regions, etc.)</li>
<li>Low-level encoding and compression schemes and their tradeoffs</li>
<li>More math and statistics knowledge. e.g. use of randomized, probabilistic algorithms in distributed systems</li>
</ul>

<p>
Roughly in two main areas:
– issues that arise in building systems that store and manipulate large datasets
– automatically extracting higher-level information from raw data
</p>

关于存储和使用大量数据集的分布式系统的几个问题：
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Programming Models.</li>
<li><p>
Distributed Systems Abstractions.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High-level tools/languages/abstractions for building distributed systems</li>
<li>Are there unifying abstractions for other kinds of distributed systems problems?
– systems for handling interactive requests &amp; dealing with intra-operation parallelism
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>load balancing, fault-tolerance, service location &amp; request distribution, &#x2026;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
– systems that seamlessly divide, expand, and contract processing subsystems?
</p></li>

<li>Building Applications on top of Weakly Consistent Storage Systems
– consistent operations (e.g. use Paxos). often imposes additional latency for common case
– inconsistent operations. better performance/availability, but apps harder to write and reason about in this model</li>

<li>Building Applications on top of Weakly Consistent Storage Systems
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Challenge: General model of consistency choices, explained and codified
– ideally would have one or more “knobs” controlling performance vs. consistency
– “knob” would provide easy-to-understand tradeoffs</li>
<li>Challenge: Easy-to-use abstractions for resolving conflicting updates to multiple versions of a piece of state
– Useful for reconciling client state with servers after disconnected operation
– Also useful for reconciling replicated state in different data centers after repairing a network partition</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Adaptivity and Self-Tuning in World-Wide Systems
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Challenge: automatic, dynamic world-wide placement of data &amp; computation to minimize latency and/or cost, given constraints on: bandwidth, packet loss, power, resource usage – failure modes, &#x2026;</li>
<li>Users specify high-level desires:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>“99%ile latency for accessing this data should be &lt;50ms” “Store this data on at least 2 disks in EU, 2 in U.S. &amp; 1 in Asia”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>ACLs in Information Retrieval Systems # 大规模系统下的权限控制问题.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Retrieval systems with mix of private, semi-private, widely shared and public documents
– e.g. e-mail vs. shared doc among 10 people vs. messages in group with 100,000 members vs. public web pages</li>
<li>Challenge: building retrieval systems that efficiently deal with ACLs that vary widely in size
– best solution for doc shared with 10 people is different than for doc shared with the world
– sharing patterns of a document might change over time</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Automatic Construction of Efficient IR Systems.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Challenge: can we have a single parameterizable system that automatically constructs efficient retrieval system based on these parameters?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Information Extraction from Semi-structured Data. # 处理半结构化数据
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Data with clearly labelled semantic meaning is a tiny fraction of all the data in the world</li>
<li>But there’s lots semi-structured data
– books &amp; web pages with tables, data behind forms, &#x2026;</li>
<li>Challenge: algorithms/techniques for improved extraction of structured information from unstructured/ semi-structured sources
– noisy data, but lots of redundancy
– want to be able to correlate/combine/aggregate info from different sources</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
处理半结构化数据.
</p>

<p>
Plenty of Data
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Text: trillions of words of English + other languages Visual: billions of images and videos</li>
<li>Audio: spoken queries, audio portion of video data, &#x2026;</li>
<li>User activity: queries, result page clicks, map requests, etc.</li>
<li>Knowledge graph: billions of labelled relation triples</li>
<li>Biology and Health: genetic data, health care records, &#x2026;</li>
<li>Physical sciences: physics, astronomy, &#x2026;</li>
<li>&#x2026;</li>
</ul>
