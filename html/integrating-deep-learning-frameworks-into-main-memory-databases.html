<h1 class="title">Integrating Deep Learning Frameworks into Main-Memory Databases</h1>
<p>
这篇文章主要说怎么把pytorch嵌入到umbra这个数据库里面去。里面有一段总结了目前把ML和DB结合起来的两种方法： a. 直接把从数据库中导出数据，讲究的就数据移动的便携性  b. 直接在DBMS里面调用ML Operator，讲究的就是和ML训练和预测的集成性。

<b>Connecting Databases to Regular Data Processing.</b>
</p>

<p>
The deep learn- ing framework TensorFlow provides a way of retrieving data from SQLite database engines [26]. Furthermore, it includes an experi- mental feature IODataset, which can connect to a Postgres endpoint [25].
</p>

<p>
Katsipoulakis et al. [7] propose a general way of integrating machine learning into SQL and streaming data between storage and processing systems.
</p>

<p>
Khan et al. present Fireworks [8], which includes data retrieval from databases using SQLAlchemy [24] as a part of their machine learning pipelines.
</p>

<p>
All of these methods require a transfer of all input data from the database to a processing environment. Especially nested queries, which require multiple environment switches will be negatively affected by this.

<b>Integrated Machine Learning in Databases Systems.</b>
</p>

<p>
Microsoft SQL Server’s stored procedures use Python and R scripts to execute virtually arbitrary processing, including deep learning [4]. Further- more, Microsoft SQL Server provides access to many data mining methods including clustering, decision trees, and basic neural net- works [2]. Microsoft’s ML system Raven adds ONNX models to SQL Server and Spark and shows interesting optimizations for queries using tree-based models [6] [16]. Raven improves ONNX Runtime performance of deep learning models leveraging SQL Server’s exe- cution parallelization and model caching.
</p>

<p>
Google’s cloud-based data warehouse BigQuery supports the use of various classical machine learning methods including deep learning models with extended SQL [3]. Furthermore, it allows to deploy trained TensorFlow models. Amazon’s sagemaker can be accessed from the database systems Redshift and Athena [11]. In contrast to our work, these systems are divided into distinct services instead and inherently have larger communication costs.
</p>

<p>
Oracle provides a set of machine learning algorithms including simple neural networks to use directly within SQL queries [15]. Oracle’s implementation performs all computations in the database kernel, which avoids the need to move the data for processing.
</p>

<p>
Sandha et al. present the integration of linear regression and basic neural networks directly integrated to the Teradata SQL En- gine using a Python runtime [19]. Their distributed approach is especially interesting for expensive training algorithms.
</p>

<p>
With TensorDB Kim et al. present a database system which adds tensor data types to the relational model, supporting many tensor operations. Missing automatic differentiation and GPU support render it, however, impractical for neural networks.
</p>

<p>
Luo et al. [12] extend the parallel database system SimSQL to support linear algebra, which can be used for a number of machine learning tasks.
</p>

<p>
With MADlib, Hellerstein et al. create a comprehensive open- source machine learning framework based on SQL and user defined functions for Postgres and Greenplum [5]. While the concepts of MADlib are transferable between database systems, it currently only supports Postgres and Greenplum Database.
</p>

<p>
Schüle et al. introduce lambda expression based tensor process- ing with automatic differentiation to the main-memory database HyPer [20]. Due to its lack of syntactical abstractions and GPU support it is only of limited use for sophisticated deep learning models. In their follow-up work, Schüle et al. add the above lambda expression based tensor processing to the Umbra database system, adding just in time GPU code generation [21]. The use of just in time compilation of GPU code allows query specific optimizations.
