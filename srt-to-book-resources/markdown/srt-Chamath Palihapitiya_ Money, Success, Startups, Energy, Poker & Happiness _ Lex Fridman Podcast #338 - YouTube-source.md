# Chapter 1

in terms of your mistakes society

 tells you don't make them because

 we will judge you and we will look down on you

 and i think the really successful people realize that actually no

 it's the cycle time of mistakes that gets you to success

 because your error rate will diminish the more mistakes that you make you

 observe them you

 figure out where it's coming from is it a psychological

 thing is it a you

 know cognitive

 thing and

 then you fix it

 following is a conversation with your mouth a

 venture capitalist and engineer founder

 and ceo of social capital previously

 in early senior executive at facebook and

 is

 the co-host of the all in podcast a

 podcast that i highly recommend for the wisdom and the camaraderie of the four co-hosts also

 known as besties

 this

 is the lux friedman podcast to

 support it please check out our sponsors in the description and

 now dear friends here's

 chamath balajapatia

 you grew up in a dysfunctional household on welfare you've talked about this before what

 war for you personally psychologically some difficult moments in your childhood

 i'll answer that question in a slightly different way which is that

 i think when you grow up

 in a household that's defined by physical abuse and psychological abuse

 you're

 hyper vigilant all the time

 and so it's actually easier for me to point to moments where

 i was happy

 or i felt compassion or i felt safe

 otherwise every moment i'll give you a couple of examples like

 you know i was thinking about this a while ago

 there was a tree outside of my apartment where we lived when i was growing up

 and my father would sometimes would make me go outside to take the tree branch

 that he would hit me with

 um and so you can imagine if

 you're a 10 11 year old kid and you have to deal with that what

 do you do well

 a hyper vigilant child learns

 how to basically estimate the strength of these branches

 right how far

 can he go before it breaks

 you have to estimate his anger and estimate the effective

 strength of you

 know branches

 and bring back something because you know i

 remember these

 moments where if it was

 he

 would look at it and then he would make me go out again and

 get it right

 get a different one

 um or

 you know there was a certain belt that he wore that had this kind of

 um belt buckle that stuck out

 and

 you just wanted to make sure if that if

 that was the thing that you were going to get hit by

 that it wasn't the buckle facing out because that really hurt

 and so you became hyper aware of

 which part of the buckle was facing out versus facing in in those moments

 and there are like hundreds of these little examples

 which

 essentially i would i would say the through line is that you're just so on edge

 right and you walk into this

 house and you're just basically

 trying

 to get to the point where you leave the house

 um and so in that microcosm of growing up

 any moment that's not like that is

 seared in my memory in a way that i just can't

 describe to a person i'll give you an example

 i

 volunteered

 when i was in grade five or six i can't remember which it was

 in the kindergarten

 of my school

 and i would just go and the teacher would you know ask

 you to clean things up

 and at the end of that great five year

 she took me and two other kids to dairy queen

 and i'd never been i've never i'd never gone to a restaurant literally because

 we just we didn't have the money

 and i remember the first time i tasted

 this you know this dairy queen meal

 it was like a hamburger

 fries a coconut

 a blizzard and i was like what is this and i felt

 so

 special you know because you're getting something that most

 people would take for granted oh it's a sunday or

 it's a you know or i'm really busy

 let me go take my kid to

 to fast

 food i

 think that you know until i left high school

 i think and this is not just specific

 to me but a lot of other people it's

 you're in this hyper vigilant loop

 punctuated with these incredibly visceral moments of compassion by other people you know a different example

 um we had such a strict budget

 and we didn't have a car

 and so you know i was responsible with my mom to always go shopping

 and so i learned very early on how to you

 know look for coupons how

 to buy things that were on sale or special

 and we had a very basic diet because you have to budget this thing really precisely

 but the end of every year

 where i lived there was a large grocery chain called loblaws and loblaws would discount

 a cheesecake from 7.99 to 4.99

 and my

 parents would buy that once a year and we probably did that six or seven times

 and you can't imagine how special we felt myself my two sisters we

 would sit there we would watch the you know the new

 year's eve celebration

 on tv we would cut

 this cheesecake into you know five pieces

 it felt like everything

 um so that's sort of how you know my

 my existence when i was at that age is

 for better or for worse that's how i remember it

 the hyper vigilance loop is that still with you today what

 are the echoes of that that's told you today the good and the bad if

 you put yourself

 in the mind of a young child

 the thing that that does to you

 is at a very core basic level it says you're worthless

 right because if

 you can

 step outside of that and you think about any child in the world

 they

 don't deserve to go through that

 and at some point by the way i should tell you like i don't blame

 my parents anymore it

 was a process to get there but

 i

 feel like they did the best they could

 and they suffered their own issues and enormous pressures and stresses

 and so you know i've

 really for the most part forgiven them

 how did you start to interrupt let go of that blame

 that was a really long process where

 i would say the first 35 years of my life

 i compartmentalized and i avoided all of those memories

 and i saw external validation

 right going back to this self-worth

 idea if you're taught as a child that you're worthless

 because why would somebody do these things to you

 it's not because you're worth something you think to yourself very

 viscerally you're worth nothing

 and so then you go out and you seek external

 validation

 maybe

 you try to go and get into a

 great college you try to get a good job you

 try to make a lot of money you

 try to you know demonstrate

 in superficial ways with the car you drive or the clothes you wear

 that you deserve people to care about you

 to try to make up for that really deep hole

 but at some point you it doesn't get filled in and so you have a choice

 and

 so for me what happened was in in the course of a six-month

 period i lost my best friend and

 i lost my father

 and

 it was really like the dam broke loose because i the compartmentalization

 stopped working because the reminder

 of why i was compartmentalizing was gone

 and so i had to go through this period of disharmony to really understand

 and steel man his perspective

 and can you imagine trying

 to do that to go through all of the things where

 you

 have to now look at it from his perspective and

 find compassion and empathy

 for what he went through

 and then i shift you know the focus to my mom and i said well

 you were not

 the victim actually you were somewhat complicit as well because you

 were of sound mind and body and you were in the room when it happened

 so then i had to go through that process with her and steal man her perspective

 and

 at the end of it i never justified what they did but

 i've been able to forgive what they did

 um i think they did the best they could and

 at the end of the day they

 did the most important thing which is they gave me and my sisters a shot by

 emigrating by

 giving up everything by

 staying in canada and

 doing whatever it took between the two of them

 to sort of claw and scrape together enough money to live so that my

 sisters and i could have a shot and

 i'm very thankful for them could they have done better obviously

 but i'm okay with what

 has taken place but it's it's been a long process

 of of

 that steel manning

 so that you can develop some empathy

 and compassion

 and

 forgive

 do you think if you talk to your dad

 shortly

 after he died and you went to that process or today you'll be able to have

 the same strength

 to forgive him

 i think it would be a very complicated journey

 i think i've learned to be incredibly open about what has happened

 and all of the mistakes i've made

 i think it's it would require him to be pretty radically honest about confirming

 what i think he went through

 because otherwise it just wouldn't work otherwise

 i would say let's keep things where they are which is i did the work

 you know with with people that have helped me obviously but you know it's

 better for him to just you know kind of hopefully he's looking from

 some place and he's thinking

 it

 was worth it i think he deserves to think that all of this because

 you know i

 think the immigrant

 challenge we're not even the immigrant challenge the

 lower middle class challenge anybody who really wants better for their kids and

 doesn't have a good toolkit to give it to them

 some of them

 just they choke up on the bat they just get so

 agitated

 about this idea that all this sacrifice will not be worth it

 that it spills out in really unproductive ways

 and i would put him in that category

 and

 their self

 evaluation

 introspection

 they have tunnel vision so they're not

 able

 to often see the damage they did i mean i've i know like

 yourself

 a few successful people that had very difficult relationships

 with their dad and you take the perspective of the dad

 they're completely in denial about any of it so if you actually have a conversation there

 would not be a deep honesty there

 and that i think that's maybe in part the way of life

 yeah and you know i remember pretty

 distinctly after i left and in this you know in my middle 30s where

 you know by all measure i had roughly become reasonably successful

 and my dad didn't particularly care about that which was so odd

 because i had to confront the fact that you know

 whether it was a title or money or press clippings he

 never really cared he

 moved on to a different set of goals which was more about my

 character and you know being a good person to my family and really preparing

 me to lead our family when he wasn't there

 and that bothered me

 because

 i thought i thought i got to the finish line and

 i thought there was going to be a

 metal

 you

 know meaning like i can tell you lex you

 know he never told me that he loved me

 i'm not sure if that's normal or not it

 was my normality and i thought there's going to be something some gold star which

 never appeared

 and so that's like a hard thing to

 kind of confront because you're like well now what is this what is this all about

 um was this all just kind of a a ruse

 but then i realized well hold on a second there were these moments

 where in his way again putting yourself in his shoes

 i think he was trying to say he was sorry he would hold my hand

 you know and he would interlock

 the fingers which i felt is that's a really intimate way of holding somebody's

 hand i think

 um so i remember those things so

 you

 know these are the things that are just etched in at least in my mind and

 at the end of it you know i think

 i've

 done a decent job in repairing

 my relationship with him even

 though you

 know it was posthumous

 it does make me wonder in which way you

 and i or we might be broken and not see it it

 might be hurting others and not see it well i think that when you grow

 up in those kinds of environments and they're all different kinds of this kind of dysfunction

 but if

 what you get from that is that you're not worthwhile you're

 not you're less than many many other people

 when you enter adulthood or you know semi-adulthood

 in your early 20s

 you

 will be in a cycle where you are hurting other people

 you may not know it

 hopefully

 you find somebody who holds you accountable and tells you and loves you enough through that

 but

 you are going to take all of that disharmony

 in your childhood and you're going to inject that disharmony

 into

 whether it's your professional relationships or your personal relationships or both until

 you get to some form of rock bottom and you start to repair

 and i think there's a lot of people that resonate with that because they

 have each suffered their own things that

 at some point in their lives have told them that they're less than

 and

 um and then they go and cope and when you cope

 eventually

 those coping mechanisms escalate

 and

 at some point it'll be unhealthy either for you but

 oftentimes it's for the people around you

 well from those humble beginnings you are now a billionaire

 how has money changed your life or maybe the landscape of experience in your life

# Chapter 2

 hopefully

 you find somebody who holds you accountable and tells you and loves you enough through that

 but

 you are going to take all of that disharmony

 in your childhood and you're going to inject that disharmony

 into

 whether it's your professional relationships or your personal relationships or both until

 you get to some form of rock bottom and you start to repair

 and i think there's a lot of people that resonate with that because they

 have each suffered their own things that

 at some point in their lives have told them that they're less than

 and

 um and then they go and cope and when you cope

 eventually

 those coping mechanisms escalate

 and

 at some point it'll be unhealthy either for you but

 oftentimes it's for the people around you

 well from those humble beginnings you are now a billionaire

 how has money changed your life or maybe the landscape of experience in your life

 does it buy happiness it

 doesn't buy happiness but

 it buys you a level of comfort for

 you to really amplify what happiness is

 i kind of think about it in the following way let's

 just say that there's a a hundred things on a table

 and the table says find happiness here

 and there are different prices

 the way that the world works

 is that many of these experiences are cordoned off a little bit behind the velvet rope

 where

 you think that there's more happiness as the prices of things escalate right

 if you live in an apartment you admire the person with the house

 if you live in a house you admire the person with the bigger house

 that person admires the person with you know

 um an island right

 um

 some person drives their car admires

 the person who flies who admires

 a person who flies business class who admires

 a person who flies first

 you know to private there's all of these escalations on this table

 and most people get to the first five or six

 and so they just naturally assume that items you know seven through a hundred is

 really where happiness is found

 and

 the just to you know tell

 you the the finish line i've

 tried a hundred and back and then i've tried to 400

 to it

 and happiness isn't there

 um but it does give you a level of comfort i read a study

 and i don't know if it's true or not but it said that

 um the absolute sort of like maximal link between money and happiness

 is around 50 million dollars

 and

 there was a it was just like a social studies

 kind of thing that

 i think one of the ivy leagues put out and

 underneath it the way that they explained

 it was because you could have a home you could have all

 kinds of the creature comforts you could take care of your family

 um and then you were left to ponder

 what it is that you really want

 i think the challenge for most people is to realize that

 this escalating arms race of you know more things will solve your problems

 is not true

 more and better is not the solution it's it's this idea that you

 are on a very precise journey that's unique to yourself you are playing a game

 of which only you are the player

 everybody else is an interloper

 and you have a responsibility to design the gameplay

 and

 i think a lot of people don't realize

 that because

 if they did i think they would make a

 lot of different

 decisions

 about how they live their life

 and i still do the same thing i mean revert

 to basically running around asking other people what

 will make you like me more

 you

 know what will make me

 more popular in your eyes and i try to do it and

 it never works

 um it is just a complete dead end is there negative aspects to money like

 for example it

 becoming harder to find people you can trust

 i think the most negative aspect is that it amplifies

 a 360 degree view of your personality

 because there are a lot of people and society tells you that

 more money is

 actually better you are a better person somehow

 and you're factually more worthwhile than some other people that have less money

 that's also a lie but

 when you're given that kind of attention it's

 very easy for you to become a caricature of yourself

 um that's probably the single worst thing that happens to you but

 i say it in the opposite way i think all i've ever seen in

 silicon

 valley as an example

 um is

 that when

 somebody gets a hold of a lot of money it

 tends to cause them to become exactly who they were meant to be

 they're either a kind person they're either a curious person they're

 either a jerk you know they're either cheap and

 they can use all kinds of masks

 but now that there's no expectations

 and society

 gives you a get out of jail free card you

 start to behave the way that's most comfortable to you so you see somebody's innate personality

 and

 that's a really interesting thing to observe because then you can very quickly bucket sort where

 do you want to spend time and who is really you know additive to your gameplay

 and who is really a negative detractor to your gameplay you're

 an investor but you're also kind of a philosopher

 um you analyze the world in

 all these different

 perspectives on all in podcasts on twitter everywhere

 do you worry that money makes puts you out of touch from

 being able to truly empathize with the experience of the general population

 which

 in

 part first

 of all on a human level that could be limiting but also as an analyst of

 human civilization that could be limiting

 i think it definitely can for

 a lot of people because

 it's just a it's an abstraction

 for you to stop caring

 right

 um i also think the other thing is that you can very quickly

 um especially in today's world become

 the scapegoat

 just to use a girardian

 like rene gerard if you look if you think about like memetic

 theory in a nutshell

 you know we're all competing

 for these very scarce resources that we are told is worthwhile and

 if you view the world through that gerardian lens

 what are we really doing we are all fighting for scarce resources whether

 that's twitter followers money

 acclaim notoriety and we all compete with each other and in that competition

 you know gerard writes like the only way you escape that loop is

 by scapegoating something or somebody

 and i think we are in that loop right now where

 just the fact of being successful

 is

 a thing that one should scapegoat

 to

 end all of this you know tension

 that we have in the world

 i

 i think that it's a little misguided

 because i don't think it solves the fundamental

 problem

 um and we can talk about the solution to some of these problems are but

 um that's i think the loop that we're all living and

 so if you become a character caricature

 and you feed yourself into it

 i mean you're not doing anything to to really advance things

 your nickname is the dictator how did you get the nickname since

 we're talking about the corrupting nature of money that

 came from poker in

 a poker game you know when you sit down it's chaos especially

 like in in our home game there's

 a ton of big egos there's people always watching you know rail birding the game all

 kinds of interesting folks

 and in that somebody needs to establish hygiene and rules and

 i really care about the integrity of the game and

 it would just require somebody to just say okay enough

 and so and then people were just like okay stop dictating and

 that's where that's where that nickname so

 who to you speaking of which is the greatest poker of

 player of all time and why is it phil hellmuth

 exactly

 you know mute probably knew this question was coming yeah

 here's what i'll say i think helmuth is

 the

 antidote to computers more than any other player playing today

 and when you see him

 in a heads up situation so i think like he's played nine

 or ten heads up tournaments

 in a row

 and he's played like basically call it 10 of the top 20 people so far

 and he's beaten all but one of them

 when you're playing heads up you know 1v1 that is the most

 um gto

 understandable

 spot meaning game theory optimal position that's

 where computers can give you an enormous edge the

 minute you add even a third player the

 value of computers and the value of their recommendations

 basically falls off a cliff okay so

 one way to think about it is helm youth is forced to play against people that

 are essentially trained like ais

 and so to be able to beat you

 know eight out of nine of them means that you are playing so orthogonally

 to

 what is considered game theory optimal and your overlaying human reasoning

 the

 judgment to say well in

 this spot i should do x but i'm going to do y it's

 not dissimilar

 in chess like what makes you know magnus carlson so good you

 know sometimes he takes these weird lines he'll sacrifice positions

 you know he'll overplay certain positions for certain you know bishops

 versus knights and all these spots that are very confusing

 and

 what it does is it throws

 people off their game i

 think he just won a recent

 online tournament

 and it's like by move

 six

 there is no gto

 move

 for his opponent to make because it's like out of the rule book maybe

 he read some game you

 know i read the quote it was like he probably read some game in

 some bar in russia in 1954

 memorized

 it and

 all of a sudden by six moves in the

 computer ai is worthless so

 that's what makes helmuth great

 the there is one person that i think is superior

 um and i think it's what daniel also

 said and i would echo that because i played phil as

 well but phil ivey is

 um the most well-rounded

 cold-blooded bloodthirsty animal

 he is he's

 just and

 he he sees

 into your solex in a way where you're just like oh

 my god stop

 looking at me

 have you ever played him yeah yeah we played we've played and you know he crushes

 the games crushes

 the games so what what is feeling crushed

 mean

 and feel like in poker is it like that

 you just can't read at all you being constantly pressured

 you

 feel off balance you

 try to bluff and the

 person reads you perfectly that kind of stuff it's

 it's a this is a really really excellent

 question because i think this has parallels

 to a bunch of other things

 okay let's just use poker as a microcosm

 to explain a bunch of other systems

 or games

 maybe it's

 um running a company

 or

 investing okay so let's use those three examples but we use poker to explain it what

 does success look like well success looks like you have positive expected value

 right in poker the simple way to summarize that is

 your opponent

 let's just say you and i are playing

 are going to make a bunch of mistakes there's

 a bunch of it that's going to be absolutely perfect

 and then there's a few spots where you make mistakes

 and then there's a bunch of places in the poker game where i play perfectly

 and i make a few mistakes

 basically your mistakes minus my mistakes is the edge right

 that's that's pure that's how poker works if

 i make fewer

 mistakes

 than

 you make i

 will make money and i will win that

 is the objective

 of the game

 translate that into business

 you're running a company

 you

 have a team of employees you have a pool of human capital that's capable of being

 productive in the world and creating something

 but you are going to make mistakes

 in making that

 maybe it doesn't completely fit the market maybe it's mispriced maybe

 it actually doesn't require all of the people that you need so the margins are wrong

 and then there's the competitive set of all the other alternatives that

 customer has

 their mistakes minus your mistakes is the expected value of google facebook apple

 etc okay now take investing

 every time you buy something somebody else on the other side is selling it to you

 is that their mistake we don't know yet but their mistakes minus your mistakes

 is how you make a lot of money over long periods of time as an investor

 somebody sold you google at forty dollars a share you bought it and you kept it

 huge mistake on their part minimal mistakes on your part

 the difference of that is the money that you made

 so life can be summarized in many ways in that way so the question is

 what can you do about other people's mistakes and the answer is nothing

 that is somebody else's game you can try to influence them you could try to subvert

 them maybe you plant a spy inside of that other person's company to sabotage

 them i guess there are things at the edges that you can do

 but my firm belief is that life success really boils down to how do you control

 your mistakes

 now this is a bit counterintuitive

 the way you control your mistakes is by making a lot of mistakes

 so taking risks you

 have to is somehow you

 have to you to

 minimize the number of mistakes let's just say you want to find love yeah

 you know you want to find something go on deeply connected with yeah

 are you do you do that by not going out on dates and yes

 sorry sorry the

 only person that thinks that's yesterday no

 i'm joking

 i'm joking no but you know what i mean like

 you have to date people you have to open yourself up you have to be authentic

 and like you

 put you you give yourself a chance to get hurt yes

 but

 you're a good person so

 you know what happens when you get hurt that

 is actually their mistake

 okay and if you are inauthentic that's your mistake

 that's

 a controllable thing in you you can tell them the truth who

 you are and

 say here's

 my pluses

 and minuses my point is there are very few things in life

 that you can't break down i think into that very simple idea

 and

 in terms of your mistakes society

 tells you don't make them because

 we will judge you and we will look down on you

 and i think the really successful people realize that actually no

 it's the cycle time of mistakes that gets you to success

 because your error rate will diminish the more mistakes that you make you

 observe them you

 figure out where it's coming from is it a psychological

 thing is it a you

 know cognitive

 thing and

 then you fix it so

 the implied thing there is that there's a

 in in business and investing in poker and dating in life is

 that there's this platonic gto

 game theory optimal thing out there and so when you say mistakes you're

 always comparing to that optimal path you could have taken i think

 slightly different i would say mistake

 is maybe a bad proxy but it's the best proxy i have for learning

 but i'm using the language of what society tells you sure

 got it society

 tells you that when you try something and it doesn't work it's a mistake

# Chapter 3

 we will judge you and we will look down on you

 and i think the really successful people realize that actually no

 it's the cycle time of mistakes that gets you to success

 because your error rate will diminish the more mistakes that you make you

 observe them you

 figure out where it's coming from is it a psychological

 thing is it a you

 know cognitive

 thing and

 then you fix it so

 the implied thing there is that there's a

 in in business and investing in poker and dating in life is

 that there's this platonic gto

 game theory optimal thing out there and so when you say mistakes you're

 always comparing to that optimal path you could have taken i think

 slightly different i would say mistake

 is maybe a bad proxy but it's the best proxy i have for learning

 but i'm using the language of what society tells you sure

 got it society

 tells you that when you try something and it doesn't work it's a mistake

 so

 i just use that word because it's the word that resonates

 most with most people got

 it

 the

 real thing that it is is learning

 yeah

 it's like in neural networks it's lost the neural network is lost exactly

 yeah all right so you're using the mistake that is most

 the the word that is the most understandable

 especially

 by the way people experience it i guess most of life is

 a sequence of mistakes the

 problem is when you use the word mistake and you think about mistakes

 it

 actually has the

 counterproductive effect of you becoming conservative in just being risk-averse

 so

 that if

 you folk if you re if you flip it and say try to maximize

 the number of successes

 somehow

 that leads you to take more risk

 um mistake scares people i think mistakes scare people because society likes

 these very simplified boundaries of who is winning and who is losing

 and they want to reward

 people who make traditional choices

 and succeed but the thing is what's so

 corrosive about that

 is that they're actually not even being put in a position to

 actually make a quote-unquote mistake and fail so i'll give you if

 you look at like getting into an elite school

 right society rewards you for being in the ivy leagues

 in a way that you know in my opinion incorrectly doesn't

 reward you for being in a non-ivy league school

 there's a certain level of status and

 presumption of intellect and capability that comes with being there

 um but that system doesn't

 really have a counterfactual because it's not as if you both go to mit and

 ohio state

 and then we can see two versions of lex friedman

 so that we can figure out that the jig is up and there was no difference

 right

 and so instead it reinforces

 this idea that there is no truth-seeking

 function there is no way to actually make this thing whole

 and

 so it tells you you

 have to get in here and

 if you don't your life is over you've

 made a huge mistake you

 know or you've failed completely

 and so you have to find different unique ways of dismantling this this is why you

 know part of what i realized

 where i got very lucky is

 i had no friends in high school i had a few cohort of acquaintances

 but part of being so hyper vigilant when i grew up was

 i was so ashamed

 of that world that i had to live in i

 didn't want to bring anyone into it i

 could not see myself that anybody would accept me

 but the thing with that is that i had no definition of

 what expectations should be so

 they were not guided by the people around me

 and so i would escape to define my expectations it's interesting but you didn't feel

 um like your dad didn't put you in a prison of expectation

 or

 we because like that's if

 you know a friend like

 that so the flip side of that you don't have any other signals

 it's

 very easy to believe like when you're in a cult that

 well

 he you know

 he was angry he

 pushed me

 he used me as a mechanism to alleviate his own frustration and

 this may sound very crazy but he also believed in me

 and so that's what created this weird duality where you were just i was always confused

 that you

 could be somebody great he

 believed that you could be he did him

 because i couldn't reconcile then the other half of the day you know those behaviors

 but what it allowed me to do was i escaped

 in my mind and i found these archetypes around me

 that were saviors to me

 so you know i grew up in ottawa ontario canada i

 grew up right

 at the point where the telecom boom was happening companies like nortel

 and newbridge networks and mitel bell

 northern research these

 were all built in in the suburbs of ottawa

 and so there were these larger than life figures entrepreneurs terry matthews michael copeland

 and so i thought i'm going to be like them i

 would read forbes magazine i would read fortune

 magazine

 i would look at the rich people

 on

 that list and say i would be like them

 not knowing

 that maybe that's not who you wanted it to be

 but it was a lifeline and it kept my mind relatively whole

 because i could direct my ambition in a direction

 and so why that's so important just circling back to this is i

 didn't have a group of friends who were like i'm going to go to community college

 you

 know i didn't have a group of friends that said well you

 know the goal is just to go

 to university get

 a simple job and like you know join

 the public service have

 a good life

 and so because i had no expectations

 and i was so afraid to venture out of my own house i

 never saw what middle class life was like and

 so i never aspired

 to it now if i was close to it i probably would have aspired

 to it because i

 my parents in their best year made 32 000 canadian together

 and

 if you're trying to raise a family of five people on thirty two thousand dollars it's

 a complicated

 job

 and

 most of the time they were probably making 20 something thousand

 and i was working since i was 14.

 so i

 knew that our station in life was not the destination we

 had to get out

 um

 but

 because i didn't have an obvious place it's not like i had a best friend whose

 house i was going to and

 i

 saw some normal functional

 home

 if i had had that in this weird way i would have aspired to that

 what

 was the worst job you had to do the

 best job

 but the worst job was

 i worked at burger king when

 i was 14 years old and i would do the closing shift and

 that was from like 6 p.m till about two in the morning and

 in ontario where i lived

 ottawa borders quebec in ontario the drinking age is 19 you

 can see where i'm going with this

 the drinking age in quebec is 18 and

 that year made all the difference to all these kids and

 so they would go get completely drunk they would come back they

 would come to the burger king you

 know you

 would

 see

 all

 these

 kids

 you

 went

 to

 high

 school

 with

 can

 you

 imagine

 how

 mortifying

 it is you know you're working there in this get up

 and they would light that place on fire vomit everywhere puking pooing peeing

 and

 when the thing shuts down at one o'clock you know

 you

 got to clean that all up

 all of it changing

 the garbage taking it out it was

 um a grind

 and it really teaches you okay i do not want this job

 i

 don't want to but it's funny that that didn't push you towards the stability

 and the security of the middle class

 like

 i

 didn't have any good examples of that

 i didn't have those around me i was so ashamed

 i could have never built a relationship where i could have seen those interactions

 to want that

 and

 so my desires

 were framed

 by these

 two random

 rich people that

 lived in my town who i'd never met

 and what i read in magazines about people like bill gates and warren buffett

 you were an early senior executive at facebook

 during a period of a lot of scaling

 in the company history i

 mean it's

 actually a fascinating period of human history in terms of technology

 well

 in terms of human civilization honestly

 what did you learn from that

 time

 about what it takes to build and scale a successful tech company a

 company that

 has

 almost

 immeasurable impact on the world

 that was an incredible moment in time because everything was so new

 to your point like even how the standards of web 2.0 at that time were

 being defined we were defining them you know i

 mean i think if you if you look in sort

 of the if

 you search in the patents

 um

 patent

 library there's a bunch of these patents that like me and zuck have for like random

 things like cookies you

 know or like cross-site javascript like all these crazy things that are just like these duh

 kind of ideas in 2023

 we

 had to invent our way around how

 do websites communicate with each other you

 know how

 do we build in the cloud versus in a data center how do we actually have

 high performance

 systems

 you

 mentioned data science the

 term and yeah we

 invented this i invented

 this thing called data

 scientist because we had a phd from google that refused to join unless

 because

 he got a job offer that says data analyst yeah

 um and so we said column

 of scientist

 because he was a phd

 in particle

 physics

 so he

 really

 you

 know he

 was a scientist

 and i said great you're a

 scientist

 here

 and

 that

 launched

 a discipline

 that

 launched it just made a term you

 know what's

 a

 rose by any other name but yeah like you

 know sometimes

 words

 like this can launch entire

 fields

 and

 it did in that case and you didn't i

 mean i guess at that time you didn't anticipate

 the

 impact of machine learning on the entirety

 of this whole process because you need machine learning to

 have both ads and recommender

 systems

 to have the feed for the social network exactly

 right the first real scaled version of machine learning not ai but machine learning was

 this thing that facebook introduced called pymk

 which is people you may know and

 the simple idea was that can we initiate a viral mechanic inside the application

 where you log in we grab your credentials we go to your email inbox

 we harvest your address book

 we do a compare we

 make some guesses

 and

 we start to present other people that you may actually know

 that may not be in your address book really

 simple you know a couple joins of some tables whatever

 and

 it started to just go crazy and the number of people that

 you

 were you were creating this density

 and entropy

 inside this social graph with what was some really simple basic math

 and that was eye-opening for us and

 what it what it led us down this path of is really understanding

 the power of like all this machine learning and

 so that infused itself into news feed you

 know and how the

 content that you saw could be tailored

 to who you were and the type of person that you were so

 there was a moment in time that

 all of this stuff was so new

 um how did you translate the app to multiple

 languages how do you launch the company in all of these countries

 how much of it is

 just kind of stumbling into things using your best like first principles gut thinking

 and how much is it like 5 10 15 20 year vision like

 how much was thinking about the future

 of the internet and

 the metaverse and

 the humanity and all that kind of stuff like because the news feed sounds

 trivial i'll say something but that's like changes everything well

 you have to remember like you know news feed

 was named and we had this thing where we would just name things what they were

 and at the time all

 of these other companies

 and if you go back into the wayback machine you can see this people

 would vent would invent you know an

 i you know an mp3 player and they would come up with some crazy name or

 they would invent a software product and come up with a crazy name right

 and it sounded like the pharma industry you

 know

 blockazimab

 you

 know tag your best friends yeah

 and you think what is this this makes no sense and

 you know this was zuck's

 thing he was like well

 this is a feat of news so we're going to call it news feed

 this is where you tag your photos so we're going to call that photo tagging

 i

 mean literally you know pretty obvious stuff

 um so

 the thing the way that those things came about though was very experimentally

 and this is where i think it's really important for people

 to understand i think bezos explains this the best

 there is a tendency after things work

 to create a narrative fallacy because it feeds your ego and

 you want to have been the person that saw it coming

 and i think it's much more honest to say we were very good probabilistic thinkers

 that

 tried to learn as quickly as possible meaning to make as many mistakes as possible you

 know i mean if you look at this very famous placard

 that facebook had from back in the day what did it say it said move

 fast and break things

 in

 societal language that's

 saying make mistakes as quickly as you can

 because

 the minute you break something that's

 you don't do that by design it's

 not a feature theoretically

 it's a bug

 but he understood that and we embraced that idea

 um i used to run this meeting once

 a week where the whole goal

 was i want to see that there was a thousand experiments

 that were run and

 show me them all from the dumbest to the most impactful

 and

 we would go through that loop

 and what did it train people not

 that you got celebrated

 for

 the right answer

 but you got celebrated for trying

 i ran 12 experiments

 12 failed and we'd be like you're the best

 can

 i just take a small tangent on that is to move fast and break things

 has

 become as like a catchphrase

 of the thing that embodies the toxic culture of silicon valley in today's

 discourse which

 confuses me of

 course words and phrases get sort

 of captured

 and so on becomes

 very reductive

 you know that's a very loaded

 set of words that together can be

 many

 years later people can view very reductive can you still man each side of that so

 yeah

 pro

 move fast and break things yeah and against yeah

 um so i think the pro have moved fast and break things is saying the following

 there's a space of things we know and a massive space of things we don't know

 and there's a rate of growth of the things we know

 but

 the rate of growth

 of the things we don't know is actually we

 have to assume

 growing

 faster

 so the most important

 thing is

 to move into the space of the things we don't know as

 quickly as possible

 and so in order to acquire knowledge we're going to assume

 that the failure mode is the nominal state

 and

 so we just need to move as quickly as we can break

 as many things as possible which means like things are breaking in code

 do

 the you know root cause analysis

 figure out how to make things better and then rapidly move into the space and

 he or she who moves fastest into that space will win it

 doesn't imply carelessness

 right it doesn't imply

# Chapter 4

 the rate of growth

 of the things we don't know is actually we

 have to assume

 growing

 faster

 so the most important

 thing is

 to move into the space of the things we don't know as

 quickly as possible

 and so in order to acquire knowledge we're going to assume

 that the failure mode is the nominal state

 and

 so we just need to move as quickly as we can break

 as many things as possible which means like things are breaking in code

 do

 the you know root cause analysis

 figure out how to make things better and then rapidly move into the space and

 he or she who moves fastest into that space will win it

 doesn't imply carelessness

 right it doesn't imply

 moving fast without also

 aggressively

 picking up the lessons from the mistakes you make well again let's

 let's steel

 manning the pro which is it's a thoughtful

 um movement around velocity and acquisition of knowledge now let's deal man the con case

 when these systems become big enough

 there is no more room

 to experiment in an open-ended way because

 the implications have broad societal impacts that

 are not clear up front

 so let's take a different less controversial example if we said you know lipitor

 um worked well for all people except south asians

 and there's a specific immuno response that we can iterate to

 and if we move quickly enough we can run 10

 000 experiments

 and we think the answer is in that space

 well the problem is that those 10 000 experiments may kill 10 million people

 so you have to move methodically when that drug was experimental

 and it wasn't being given to 500 million people in the world

 moving

 fast made sense because you could have a pig model a mouse model a

 monkey model you

 could figure out toxicity

 but we picked all that low hanging fruit

 and so now these small iterations

 have huge impacts that need to be measured and implemented

 different example is like you know if you work at boeing

 and you have an implementation that gives you a two percent efficiency by

 reshaping the wing or adding winglets

 there needs to be a methodical move slow be right process

 because mistakes when they compound when it's already implemented and at scale have huge externalities that

 are impossible to measure until after the fact and you see this in the 737 max

 so that's how one would steel man the

 the con case which is that when an industry becomes critical you

 got to slow down

 this makes me sad because

 some industries like twitter and facebook are a good example

 they achieve scale very quickly before really exploring the big area

 of

 things to learn so you basically pick

 one low-hanging fruit and

 that became your huge success and now you're sitting there with that stupid fruit well

 so you're you're i think so as an example like you know if you had to

 you know if if i was running facebook for a day

 you know the big opportunity in my opinion was really not the metaverse

 but it was actually getting the closest that anybody could get to agi

 and

 if i had to steal man that product case here's

 what how i would have pitched it to the board into zuck

 i would have said listen there

 are three and a half billion

 people monthly using

 this thing if

 we think about human intelligence very reductively

 we would say that there's a large portion of it which is cognitive

 and then there's a large portion of it which is emotional

 we have the best ability to build a multimodal model

 that basically takes all of these massive inputs together to

 try to intuit how a system would react to all kinds of stimuli

 that

 to me would have been a profound leap

 forward for humanity can you dig into that a little bit more so in

 terms of

 now this is a board meeting how would that make facebook money

 i think that you have all of these

 systems over time that

 that we don't know could benefit from

 um some layer of reasoning to make it better

 um what does spotify look like when

 instead of just a very simple recommendation

 engine it

 actually understands sort of your emotional context and your mood and

 can move you to a body of music that you would like what

 does it look like if you know your television instead

 of having to go and channel surf you know 50

 000 shows on a horrible ui you know instead

 just has a sense of what you're into and shows it to you

 um what does it mean when you get in your car and

 it

 actually drives

 you to a place because you should actually eat there even though you don't know it

 these are all random things that make no sense a priority

 but it starts to make the person or the provider of that service

 the critical reasoning layer for

 all these everyday products that today would look very flat without that reasoning

 and

 i think you license

 that

 and you make a lot of money so in many ways

 instead

 of becoming

 more

 of the pixels that you see you've

 become more of the bare metal that

 actually creates that experience and if you and if you look at the companies

 that are multi-decade legacy kinds of businesses

 the thing that they have done is quietly and surreptitiously

 move down the stack you

 never move up the stack to survive you

 need to move down the stack so if you take that osi reference stack right these

 layers of how you build an app from the physical layer

 to the transport layer all the way up to the app layer

 you can map from

 the 1980s all the big companies that have been created right

 all the way from fairchild semiconductor and nat semi to intel to cisco to three com

 you know oracle

 netscape

 at one point all the way up to the googles and facebooks of the world

 but if you look at where all the locking happened

 it's

 by companies like apple who

 used to make software saying

 i'm

 going to get one close i'm going to make the bare metal and

 i'm going to become the platform or

 google same

 thing i'm going to create this dominant platform and i'm going to create a substrate

 that organizes

 all this information that's

 just omnipresent

 and everywhere

 so the key is if you are lucky enough to be one of these apps

 that are in front of people

 you better start digging quickly and

 moving your way down and get out of the way and disappear but

 by disappearing you will become much much bigger

 and it's impossible to usurp you yeah i 100 agree with you

 um that's why you're so smart this is the depersonalization and

 the algorithms that enable deep personalization almost like a operating system layer

 so pushing away from the interface and the actual system that does the personalization i

 think the challenge is there there's obviously technical challenges

 but there's also societal challenges that

 it's

 like in a relationship if

 you have an intimate algorithmic connection with individual humans you

 can do both good and bad and so there's risks that you're taking you can so

 if you're making a lot of money now is twitter and facebook with

 ads surface layer ads

 what is the incentive to take the risk

 of guiding people more

 because you can hurt people you can piss off people you can

 um i mean there's a cost to forming a more intimate relationship with the users

 in the short term i think you said a really really key thing which is

 um which was a really great

 emotional

 instinctive

 reaction which is when

 i said the agi

 thing you said well how would you ever make money from that

 that

 is the key the

 presumption

 is that this thing would not be an important thing at the beginning and

 i think what that allows you to do if you were twitter

 or google or apple or facebook anybody

 microsoft

 embarking

 on building something like this is that you can actually have it off the critical path

 and you can experiment with this for years if that's what it takes to

 find a version one that is special enough where it's worth showcasing

 and

 so in many ways you get the free option you're

 going to be spending

 any of these companies

 will

 be spending tens of billions of dollars in opex

 and capex

 every year and all kinds of stuff

 it is not a thing that money

 um actually makes more likely to succeed in fact

 you actually don't need to give these kinds of things a

 lot of money at all because

 starting

 in 2023 or right now

 you know you have the two most important tectonic

 shifts that have ever happened in our lifetime in technology they're

 not talked about but these things allow agi

 i think to emerge

 over the next 10 or 15 years where it wasn't possible

 for the

 first thing is that the marginal cost of energy is zero

 not gonna pay for anything anymore

 right

 and we can double click into

 why

 that why

 that

 is and the second is

 the marginal

 cost of

 compute

 to zero

 and so when you when you take the

 multiplication

 or you know if you want to get really fancy mathematically

 the convolution of these two things together it's

 going to change everything

 so

 think about

 what a billion dollars gets today when we can use open ai as an example

 a billion dollars gets open ai a handful of functional models and

 a pretty fast iterative loop

 right

 but imagine what

 um openai had to overcome

 that to overcome a compute challenge they

 had to strip together a whole bunch of gpus that

 to build all kinds of scaffolding

 software they

 had to find data center support that

 consumes

 all kinds of money so that billion

 dollars didn't go that far so

 it's a testament to how clever

 that openai team is

 but in four years from now when energy costs zero and basically gpus

 like you know they're falling off a truck and

 and you can use them for effectively for free

 now all of a sudden a billion dollars gives you some amount of teraflops

 of compute that is probably

 the total number of teraflops available today in the world like that's how gargantuan

 this

 move is when you take these two variables to zero there's

 like a million things to ask i almost don't want to get distracted by the

 marginal

 cost of energy going

 to zero because i

 have

 no idea what you're talking about that is fascinating

 can i give you the 30 seconds sure okay yes okay

 so

 if you look inside of the two most progressive

 states the

 three most progressive

 states new

 york california

 and massachusetts a

 lot of left-leaning folks a lot of people who believe in climate science and climate change

 the

 energy costs in those three states are the worst they are in the entire country and

 energy is compounding at

 three to four percent per annum so every decade to 15 years energy

 costs in these states double in

 some cases and in some months our energy costs are increasing by 11 a month

 but the

 ability to actually generate

 energy is

 now effectively zero the

 cost per kilowatt

 hour to

 put a solar

 panel on your roof and a battery wall inside your garage it's

 the cheapest it's ever been these

 things are the most efficient they they've ever been and

 so to acquire energy from the sun and

 store it for your use later on literally

 is a zero cost proposition

 so what's how do you explain the gap between the cost going great question

 so

 this is the other side of regulatory

 capture right you know we all fight to build monopolies

 while there are monopolies hiding in plain sight the

 utilities are a perfect example there

 are a hundred million homes in america there

 are about 1700

 utilities in america so they have captive markets

 but in return for that captive market the law says need

 to invest a certain amount per year in

 upgrading that power line in

 changing out that turbine in making sure you transition from coal

 to wind or whatever

 just as an example

 upgrading

 power lines in the united states over the next decade is a two trillion dollar proposition

 these 1700 organizations have to spend i

 think it's a quarter of a trillion dollars a year

 just to change the power lines that

 is why even though it costs nothing to make energy you

 are paying double every five every seven or eight years

 it's capex and opex of a very brittle old infrastructure

 it's like you

 trying

 to build an app and

 being forced

 to build your own data

 center and you say but wait i just want to write to aws

 i

 just want to use gcp i just want to move on

 all

 that complexity solved for me and

 some law says no you can't you got to use it so that's

 what consumers

 are dealing with but it's also what industrial

 and manufacturing

 organizations

 it's

 what we all deal with so how do we get rid ourselves off this old infrastructure

 that we're paying so

 the thing that's happening today which i think is

 this is why i think it's the most important trend right now in the world is

 that a hundred million homeowners

 are each going to become their own little power plant and compete with these 1700 utilities

 just

 just deal with the united states for a second because i think it's easier

 to see here

 100 million homes solar

 panel on the roof and by the way just

 to make it clear the sun doesn't need to shine right these these

 panels now work where you have these uv bands that can actually extrapolate

 beyond the visible spectrum so they're usable in all weather conditions

 and a simple system can support you

 collecting enough power to not just run your functional day-to-day life

 but then to contribute what's left over back into the grid

 for google's data center or facebook's data center where you get a small check

 the cost is going to zero how obvious is this to people you're making yourself okay

 so

 because this is a pretty profound prediction if the cost is indeed go to zero

 that i mean the compute the cost of compute going to zero i can so

 the cost to compute going to zero is can kind of understand but

 the energy seems

 like a radical prediction

 of

 yours well

 it's just it's just naturally what's happening

 right

 now now let me let me give you a different

 way of explaining

 this

 if you look at

 any system there's a really important thing that happens it's what clay

 christensen

 calls

 crossing the chasm if you explained

 it numerically

 here's how i would explain it to you lex if

 you introduce a disruptive product typically

 what happens is the first three to five percent of people are these zealous believers

 and they ignore

 all the logical reasons why this product doesn't make any sense

 because they believe in the proposition of the future and they buy it

 the problem is at five percent if you want a product to

 get to mass market you

 have one of two choices which is you either bring the cost down low enough or

 the feature set becomes so compelling that even at a high price point an

# Chapter 5

 right

 now now let me let me give you a different

 way of explaining

 this

 if you look at

 any system there's a really important thing that happens it's what clay

 christensen

 calls

 crossing the chasm if you explained

 it numerically

 here's how i would explain it to you lex if

 you introduce a disruptive product typically

 what happens is the first three to five percent of people are these zealous believers

 and they ignore

 all the logical reasons why this product doesn't make any sense

 because they believe in the proposition of the future and they buy it

 the problem is at five percent if you want a product to

 get to mass market you

 have one of two choices which is you either bring the cost down low enough or

 the feature set becomes so compelling that even at a high price point an

 example of the latter is the iphone

 the

 iphone today the 14 iphone cost

 more than the original iphone it's probably doubled

 in price over the last 14 or 15 years but

 we view it as an essential element of what we need in our daily lives

 it turns out that battery evs and solar panels are an example of the former

 because people like president biden with all of these subsidies

 have now introduced so much money for people to

 just do this where it is a money making proposition for a hundred million homes

 and what you're seeing as a result are all of these companies

 who want to get in front of that trend why

 because they want to own the relationship with 100 million

 homeowners

 they want to manage the power infrastructure

 amazon home

 depot lowe's

 you

 know you just name the company

 so if you do that and you control that relationship

 they're

 going to show you they're going you know for example amazon will

 probably say if

 you're a member of prime

 we'll stick the panels on your house for free

 we'll do all the work for you for free

 and it's just a feature of being a member of prime and

 we'll manage all that energy for you it makes so much sense and it is mathematically

 accretive

 for amazon to do that it's not a creative

 for the existing energy industry because they get blown up

 it's extremely accretive for peace and prosperity

 if you think the number of wars we fight over natural resources

 take them all off the table if we don't need energy from abroad

 there's no reason to fight you know this you'd have to find a reason to fight

 um meaning sorry there'd be a moral reason to fight but

 the last number of wars that we fought

 were not as much rooted in morality as they were rooted in yeah

 it feels like they're very much rooted in

 conflicts

 over

 resources

 energy specifically

 and then sorry just the last thing i want to say i keep interviewing apologies

 but the

 chips

 all

 what what people want

 to say is that you know now that we're at two and three nanometer

 scale for

 typical kind of like transistor fab

 we're done and

 you know forget about transistor

 density forget about moore's lots over and i would just say no look

 at teraflops

 and really teraflops

 is the

 combination of cpus but

 much much less important and

 really is the combination of asics so application

 specific ics

 and

 gpus

 and so you put the two together i

 mean if i gave you a billion dollars five years from now

 the amount of damage you could do damaged in good way in

 terms of you know building racks and racks of gpus the

 kind of models that you could build the training

 sets and the data that you could consume

 to solve a problem

 it's

 it's enough to to do something really powerful whereas today it's not yet quite enough

 so there's this really interesting idea that you talk about in terms

 of facebook and twitter that's

 connected to this that if you were running sort of twitter

 or facebook that you would move them all to like aws

 so you would

 have somebody else to come the compute the infrastructure it

 probably if you could explain that reasoning

 means

 that

 you believe in this idea of energy going to zero compute going to zero so let

 people that are optimizing

 that

 do the best job and

 i think that's a you know the

 initially in the early 2000s and the beginning of the 2010s

 if you were a big enough scale

 oh sorry everybody was building their own stuff then between 2010 through 2020

 really the idea was everybody should be on aws except the biggest of the biggest folks

 i think in the 2020s

 and 30s i think the answer is actually everybody should be in these public clouds and

 the reason is the engineering velocity of the guts

 so

 you know take a simple example

 which is you know we have not seen a massive iteration in database design until

 snowflake

 right i think maybe postgres was like the last big turn of the dial

 why is that i don't exactly know except

 that everybody that's on aws and everybody that's on gcp in azure gets

 to now benefit from

 a hundred plus billion dollars of aggregate market cap rapidly iterating

 making mistakes

 fixing solving learning and that is a best-in-class industry now right

 then

 there's going to be all these ai layers around analytics so

 that app companies can make better decisions

 all of these things will allow you to build more nimble organizations because

 you'll have this federated model of development

 i'll take these things off the shelf maybe i'll roll my own stitching over here

 because the thing that where you make money is

 still for most people and how the apps provision and experience to

 a user and

 everybody else can make a lot of money just servicing that so

 they work in a really

 um they play well together in the sandbox so in the future everybody

 just should be there it doesn't make sense for anybody i don't think because you

 know if

 you were to rule

 your own data

 centers

 you

 know for example

 like google

 for

 a long time had

 these massive leaps where they had gfs

 and bigtable

 those are really good in the 2000s and 2010s

 and this is not just throw shade at google it's

 very hard for whatever exists

 that is a that

 is the progeny

 of gfs and bigtable

 to be anywhere near as good as a hundred billion dollar industries

 attempt

 to build that stack

 and you're putting your organization under enormous pressure to be that good

 i guess the implied risk taken there is that you could become the next aws

 like

 um tesla doing some of the compute in-house

 i guess the bet there is that you can become the next the

 next aws for the

 new wave of computation if that level if

 that kind of computation is different so if it's machine learning

 i don't know if anyone's won that battle yet which is machine learning centric well software

 has a very powerful property in

 that there's a lot of things that can happen asynchronous asynchronously

 so that real-time inference can be actually really lightweight code deployment and

 that's why i think you can have a very federated ecosystem inside

 of inside of all of these places tesla

 is very different because in

 order to build the best car it's

 kind of like trying to build the best iphone which

 is that you need to control it

 all the way down to the bare

 metal in

 order to do it well

 and

 that's just not possible if

 you're trying to be a systems integrator which is what everybody other

 than this modern generation of car companies

 have been and they've done a very good job of that

 but

 it won't be the experience that allows you to win in in the next 20 years

 so let's linger on the social media thing so

 if you you said if you ran facebook for a day let's let's let's extend

 that if

 you were to build a new social network today

 how would you fix

 twitter how would you fix social media

 if you want to answer a different question is if you were elon

 musk

 somebody

 you know and you were taking over twitter what

 would you fix i

 thought about this a little bit

 um

 first

 of all let me give you a backdrop

 i wouldn't actually build a social media

 company at

 all

 and the answer is the reasoning

 is the following

 um i

 really tend to believe as you've probably gotten a sense of sort of patterns and probabilities

 and if you said to meth

 probabilistically

 answer where where are we going in

 apps and social experiences what i would say is lex

 we spent the first decade building platforms and getting them to scale

 and if you want to think about it again back to sort of this poker analogy

 others mistakes minus your mistakes is the value

 well the value that was captured was trillions of dollars essentially to apple and to google

 and they did that by basically

 um attracting billions of monthly active users to their platform

 then this next way were the apps

 facebook qq10 tick tock twitter snapchat that whole panoply of apps

 and interestingly they were in many ways an atomized version of the platforms

 right they sat on top of them they were an ecosystem participant

 but the value they created was the same trillions of dollars of enterprise value

 billions of monthly active users

 well there's an interesting phenomenon that's kind of hiding in plain sight

 which is that the

 next most obvious atomic unit

 are content creators now let me give you two examples lex friedman this random crazy guy

 mr beast you know jimmy donaldson just the two of you alone added

 add it up okay and

 you guys are going to approach in the next five years a

 billion people the

 only thing that you guys haven't figured

 out yet is how to capture trillions

 of dollars of value now

 maybe you don't want to and

 maybe that's

 not your state admission

 right

 right but

 let's just look at mr beast alone because he is trying to do exactly

 that probably yeah

 and i think jimmy is going to build an

 enormous business but

 if you take jimmy and all of the other content creators right

 you guys are atomizing

 what the apps have done

 you're providing your own curated news feeds you're providing your own curated communities you're

 allowed

 you let people move

 in and out of these things in a very lightweight

 way and

 value is accruing to you so the

 honest answer to your question is i would focus on the content creator

 side of things because i believe that's where the puck is going that's

 a much more important

 shift

 in how we all consume information content

 and are entertained

 it's

 through brands like you individual

 people that we can humanize and understand are

 the filter

 but

 aren't you just arguing

 against the point you made earlier

 which

 is what you would recommend

 is the invest in the agi

 the

 the depersonalization

 because because they they could

 still be a participant in that in that end state if that happens you

 have the option value of being an enabler of that

 right you

 can help improve what they do again you can be this bare metal service provider

 where you can be a tax

 yeah right you can participate in every thing

 that you do every question that's asked every comment that's curated if

 you could have more intelligence

 as you provide a service to your fans in your audience you

 would probably pay a small percentage of that revenue i

 suspect all content creators would and so it's that stack of services that

 is like a smart human being it's like you know how do you help produce

 this information you

 would pay a producer for that i mean maybe you would but so

 back to your question so what would i do

 i think that you have to move into that world

 pretty aggressively

 um i think that right now you first have to solve what

 is broken inside of these social networks

 and i don't think it's a technical problem

 so just to put it out there i don't think it's a

 you know it's one where there are these nefarious organizations that happens brigading xyz that happens

 but the real problem is a psychological one that we're dealing with which is people

 through a whole set of situations

 have lost belief in themselves

 and i think that that

 comes

 up as this very virulent

 form of rejection that they tried to put into these social networks

 so if you look inside of comments on

 anything like

 you could have a con like

 you could have a person that says on twitter

 i saved this dog from a fiery building

 and there would be negative commenters

 and you're like well again

 put yourself in their shoes what

 do you how do i steal man their case i do this all the time you

 know i get people

 throw shade at me i'm like okay let me steal man their point of view

 and

 the best that i can come up with is you know i'm

 working really

 hard over here i'm

 trying i

 played by all the rules that were told to me

 i've played well i played fairly and

 i am not being rewarded in a system of value that you recognize

 and that is making me mad and

 now i need to cope and i need to vent

 so

 back in the day my dad used to drink he

 would make me go get things to hit me with

 today

 you

 go to twitter you

 spot off you try to deal with

 the

 latent anger that you feel so

 a social network has to be designed in my opinion

 to solve that psychological corner case because it is what makes a network unusable

 to get real density you

 have to find a way of

 moving away from that toxicity because it ruins a product experience

 you could have the best pixels in the world but if people are virulently spitting

 into their keyboards

 other

 people are just going to say you know what i'm done with this it

 doesn't make me feel good

 so

 the

 social network has to have a social cost you

 can do it in a couple ways one

 is where you have real world identity so then there's a cost to being virulent

 and there's a cost to being caustic

 a second way is to actually just overlay an economic framework

 so that there's a more pertinent economic value that you assign to

 basically spouting off

 and the more you want to spend the more you can say

 and

 i think both have

 a

 lot of value i don't know what the right answer

 is i tend to like the

 latter

 i think real world identity shuts

 down a lot of debate because

 there's still too much

 um you know there's a sensation that there that there'll be some retribution

 um so i think there's more free speech over here but it cannot be costless

 because in that there's a level of toxicity that just makes these products unusable

 what

 about a third option and

 by the way all of these can work together

 if

 we look at this what you call the corner case was just hilarious

 what i would call the human condition

 which is you know that anger is rooted with the challenges of life and

 what about having a

 um an algorithm that shows you what you see

 that's personalized to you and helps you maximize your personal growth in the long term such

# Chapter 6

 a

 lot of value i don't know what the right answer

 is i tend to like the

 latter

 i think real world identity shuts

 down a lot of debate because

 there's still too much

 um you know there's a sensation that there that there'll be some retribution

 um so i think there's more free speech over here but it cannot be costless

 because in that there's a level of toxicity that just makes these products unusable

 what

 about a third option and

 by the way all of these can work together

 if

 we look at this what you call the corner case was just hilarious

 what i would call the human condition

 which is you know that anger is rooted with the challenges of life and

 what about having a

 um an algorithm that shows you what you see

 that's personalized to you and helps you maximize your personal growth in the long term such

 that you're

 challenging

 yourself you're improving you're learning there's just enough of criticism

 to

 keep you on your toes but

 just enough of like the dopamine rush to keep you entertained

 and finding that balance for each individual person you

 just described an agi of a very empathetic

 well-rounded friend yes

 exactly and

 and then you can throw that person even anonymous into a pool of discord and

 they would be better i think you're absolutely right that's

 a very very very elegant

 way of stating it you're absolutely but like you said the agi

 might

 be a few years away so

 that's a huge investment like my concern my

 gut feeling is this age thing we're calling agi

 is actually not that difficult to build technically but

 it requires a certain culture and it requires a certain certain

 risks to be taken i think you could reductively boil down the human intellect

 into

 cognition and emotion

 and you know depending

 on who you are and depending on the moment they're weighted very differently obviously

 um cognition is so easily done by computers

 that we should assume that that's a solved problem

 so our differentiation

 is the reasoning part it's the emotional

 overlay

 it's that it's the empathy it's the ability to steal man the opposite person's

 case and and

 feel why that person

 you know you can forgive them without excusing what they did as an example

 um that is a very difficult thing i think to capture in software but

 i think it's a matter of when not if

 if done crudely it

 takes a form of censorship just

 banning

 people off the platform let

 me ask you some tricky questions

 do you think trump should have been removed from twitter no what's the what's

 the pro case can you i'm having fun here you still man each side yeah

 um let's deal man to get him off the platform here we have a guy who

 um is virulent in all ways he promotes confrontation

 he lacks decorum he

 incites the fervent believers of his cause

 to act up and push the boundaries bordering on and potentially even including breaking the law

 he

 does not observe

 the social norms of

 a society that keep us while functioning including

 an orderly transition of power

 if he is left in a moment where he feels trapped and cornered

 he could behave in ways that

 will confuse the people that believe in him

 to act in ways that they so regret that

 um it could bring our democracy to an end or

 create so much damage or create a wound that's so deep it

 will take years of conflict and years of confrontation

 to heal it

 we need to remove him and

 we need to do it now it's

 been too long we've

 let it go on too long

 the other side of the argument would be he was a duly elected person whose

 views have been run over for

 way too long

 and he uses the ability to say extreme things in order to showcase

 how corrupt these systems have become

 and how insular these organizations are in protecting their own class

 and so if you really want to prevent class warfare

 and if you really want to keep the american dream alive for everybody we

 need to show that the first amendment the constitution the second amendment all

 of this infrastructure is

 actually bigger than any partisan view no matter how bad it is and that people

 will make their own decisions

 and there are a lot of people that can see past the words he uses

 and focus on the substance of what he's trying to get across and

 more generally agree than disagree and so when you silence that voice

 what you're effectively saying is this is a rigged game and

 all of those things that we've told we were told were not true are actually true

 if you were to look at the crude algorithms of twitter of

 course i don't have any insider knowledge but

 i could imagine that they saw

 the

 let's

 say there's a metric that measures how

 negative the experience is of the platform and they probably saw

 in several

 ways you could look at this but

 the presence of donald trump on the platform was

 consistently increasing how shitty people are feeling

 short-term and long term because they're probably yelling at each other having

 worse

 and worse and worse experience if you even do a survey of how

 do you feel about using this platform over

 the last week they

 would say horrible

 relative to maybe a year ago when

 donald trump was not actively

 tweeting or so on so

 here you're sitting at twitter and

 saying

 okay i

 i and i know everyone's talking about speech

 and all that kind of stuff but i kind of want to build a platform

 where the users

 are happy

 and they're becoming more and more unhappy how do i solve this happiness problem well

 let's

 ban

 let's let's

 yeah let's ban the sources of the unhappiness now we can't just say you're

 a source of unhappiness so we'll ban you let's wait until that source says something that

 we can claim

 breaks our rules like insights violence or so on that would work if you could measure

 your

 construct of happiness properly the problem is i think what twitter looked at were active commenters

 and got it confused for overall system happiness

 because

 for every piece of content that's created on the internet of

 the hundred people that consume it maybe one or two people comment on it and

 so by over amplifying

 that signal and

 assuming that it was the plurality of people that's

 where they actually made a huge blunder because

 there was no scientific method i think to get to the answer of de-platforming

 him and

 it did expose

 this idea that it's a bit of a rigged game and

 that there are these deep biases

 that

 some of these organizations have to

 opinions that are counter to theirs and to their orthodox view of the world

 so in general you lean towards keeping

 um first of all presidents on the platform but also

 controversial

 voices all

 the time i

 think it's really important to keep them there let

 me ask you a trick tricky

 one in the recent news that's

 become especially

 relevant

 for me what

 do you think about if you've been paying attention to yay kanye west

 a recent controversial outburst on social media

 about

 and jews

 black people

 racism in general

 slavery holocaust all these topics that

 he touched on in different ways on different platforms but including

 twitter what

 do you do with that and

 like what do you do what do you do with that from a platform perspective what

 do you do from a humanity

 perspective

 of

 how to add love to the world

 let's

 um should we take both sides of them sure option one is he is

 completely out of line and option two is he's not just the same sure right so

 the

 path one

 is

 he is an incredibly

 important taste maker in the world that defines the belief system for a lot of people

 and there just is no room

 for

 any form of racism

 or bias or anti-semitism in

 today's day and age particularly by people

 whose

 words and comments will be amplified around the world

 we've already paid a large price for that and then the expectation

 of success is some amount of societal decorum that keeps moving the ball forward

 the other side would say

 life i think goes from harmony to disharmony to repair

 and anybody who has gone through a very complicated divorce

 will tell you that in that moment your life is extremely disharmonious

 and you are struggling to cope and because he is famous

 we are seeing

 a person really struggling in a moment

 that may need help

 and we owe it to him not for what he said because that stuff isn't excusable

 but we owe it to him to help him in a way and particularly his friends

 and if he has real friends

 hopefully what they see is that what i see on the outside looking in

 is a person that is clearly struggling

 can i ask you like a human question and i know it's outside looking in but

 there's several questions i want to ask

 so

 one is about the pain of going through a

 divorce and having kids and all that kind of stuff and

 two when you're rich and powerful and

 famous i don't know maybe you can enlighten me into which is the most corruptive

 um but how do you know who are the friends to trust

 so

 a lot of the world is calling kanye insane

 and if orlick has mental illness all that kind of stuff and

 so how do you have friends close to you let's

 say

 let's say something like that message but from a place of

 love and

 where they actually care for you as opposed to trying to get you to shut up

 the reason i ask all those questions i think

 if you care about the guy how do you help him right

 i've been through a divorce it's gut wrenching

 the most horrible part is having to tell your kids

 i can't even describe it to you

 um how proud i am and how resilient these three beautiful little creatures were when my

 ex-wife and i had to sit them down and talk through it

 um and for that thing i'll be just so protective of them and so proud

 of them and

 um it's hard now i don't know that that's what he went through

 um but it doesn't matter in

 that moment there's no fame there's no money there's nothing there's just the raw intimacy

 of a nuclear

 family

 breaking up in that there is a death and it's the death of that idea

 and that is extremely extremely

 profound in its impact especially in your children

 um it is really hard really

 hard could you have seen yourself in the way you see the world being

 clouded during

 especially

 at first to where you would make poor decisions outside

 of your outside of that nuclear family so like business poor business decisions poor

 tweeting

 decisions poor

 i think that writing decision if i had to boil down

 a lot of those what

 i would say is that there

 are moments in my life flex where i have felt

 meaningfully

 less than

 and in those moments

 the

 loop that i would fall into is

 i would look to cope and be seen by other people so

 i would throw away

 all of the work i was doing around my own internal validation

 and

 i

 would try to say something or do something that would get the attention of others and

 oftentimes you know when that loop was

 um was unproductive it's because those things had really crappy

 consequences so

 you know that was that was yeah so yeah i i went through that as

 well so i had to go through you

 know this disharmonious

 phase in my life and then to repair it you know i had the benefit of

 meeting someone and

 building a relationship

 um block by block where there is just enormous accountability

 where my partner not had has just incredible empathy

 um but accountability

 and so she can put herself in my shoes sometimes

 when i'm a really tough person to be around

 but then she doesn't let me off the hook she

 can forgive me but

 it doesn't make you know what i may have said or whatever you

 know excusable

 and that's been really healthy for me and it's helped me repair my relationships

 be

 a better parent you

 know be a better friend

 to my ex-wife who's a beautiful woman who

 you know i love deeply and will always love her and

 it took me a few years to see that that

 it was just a chapter that had come to an end but she's

 an incredible mother and an incredible businesswoman

 and i'm so thankful that i've had two incredible women in my life

 that's like a blessing but

 it's hard so

 with that it's hard to find a person that

 has that i

 mean a lot of stuff you said is pretty profound but

 having that person who has empathy

 and accountability

 so basically that's ultimately what great friendship

 is

 which

 is people that love you have empathy

 for you but can also call you out on your bullshit she's a lebron james-like

 figure and the reason i say that is

 i've seen and met so many people i've seen the distribution on

 the scale of friendship and empathy

 she's the

 lebron

 james of friendship she's a goat well

 what's so funny is like you know we

 have a dinner around poker

 and it's taken on a life of its own mostly

 because of her because these guys look to her and i'm like whoa whoa [laughter]

 her registers are already full she's thinking of all kinds of crap with me

 um but

 um

 but it's a it's a it's a very innate skill and

 it's paired with you know it's but it's not just an emotional thing meaning

 she's the person that i make all my decisions with

 these decisions we're making together as a team i've

 never understood that you know there's that african pop proverb like go

 fast go alone go far go together

# Chapter 7

 for you but can also call you out on your bullshit she's a lebron james-like

 figure and the reason i say that is

 i've seen and met so many people i've seen the distribution on

 the scale of friendship and empathy

 she's the

 lebron

 james of friendship she's a goat well

 what's so funny is like you know we

 have a dinner around poker

 and it's taken on a life of its own mostly

 because of her because these guys look to her and i'm like whoa whoa [laughter]

 her registers are already full she's thinking of all kinds of crap with me

 um but

 um

 but it's a it's a it's a very innate skill and

 it's paired with you know it's but it's not just an emotional thing meaning

 she's the person that i make all my decisions with

 these decisions we're making together as a team i've

 never understood that you know there's that african pop proverb like go

 fast go alone go far go together

 and

 lex since since i was born i was by myself

 and

 i had to cope and

 i didn't have a good tool kit to

 use into the world

 and

 in these last five or six years she's

 helped me and at first my toolkit was literally like

 sticks you know and

 then i found a way to you

 know she helped me sharpen

 a little rock and that became a little knife but even that was crap and

 then she showed me fire and then i forged a knife and that and

 that's what it feels like where now this toolkit is like most average people

 and i feel humble to be average because i was here down here on the ground

 so it's made all these things more reasonable so i see

 what comes from having deep profound friendships and love to

 help you through these critical moments i have another friend who

 um who i would say just completely unabashedly loves me this guy rob goldberg he

 doesn't

 hold me accountable

 that much which i love like i could say i killed a homeless person he's

 like ah they probably deserved

 it you

 know whereas that would be like that was not good what you just did so

 but i have both

 i

 mean i have nat

 every day you know rob i don't talk to that often but to

 have two people

 i had zero i think most people unfortunately have zero

 um so i think like what what he needs is somebody to just listen

 you don't have to put a label on these things

 and

 you just have to try to guide in these very unique

 moments

 where you can just like

 de-escalate

 what

 is going on in your mind and

 i suspect

 what's

 going on in his mind again to play armstrong quarterback i don't know

 is that he is in a moment where he just feels lower than low

 and

 we all do it we've all had these moments where we don't know how

 to get attention

 and if you didn't grow up in a healthy environment you

 may go through a negative way to get attention

 and it's not to excuse it but it's to understand it

 that's so profound the feeling less than and at those low points

 going externally to find it and maybe creating conflict

 and scandal to get that attention the way that my doctor explained it to me is

 um

 you have to think about yourself worth like

 a knot it's inside of

 a very complicated

 set of knots so

 it's like a some

 people don't have these knots it's

 just presented

 to you on a platter

 but for some of us because of the way we grow up it's

 covered in all these knots so

 the whole goal

 is to loosen those knots

 and it happens slowly it happens unpredictably and it takes a long time

 and

 so while you're doing that you are going to have moments

 where when you feel less than you're not prepared

 to

 look inside and say actually here's

 how i feel about myself it's pretty cool i'm happy with how where i'm at

 i have to ask on

 the topic of friendship you

 do an amazing podcast called all in podcast people

 should stop listening to this and go listen to that you

 just did your 100th episode i

 mean it's one of my favorite podcasts it's incredible for

 the

 the the technical and the human psychological wisdom that you guys

 constantly give and in the way you analyze the world but also just the chemistry

 between the between you you're clearly there's there's a tension and

 there's a camaraderie that's all all laid out on on the table so

 i don't know the two davids that well but i have met jason what

 do you love about him i mean i'll give you a little psychological

 breakdown of all three of these guys sure

 um just my opinion yeah and i love you guys

 um would

 they agree with your psychological

 breakdown i

 don't know you know i

 i think that what i would say about

 jay cal is

 he is unbelievably

 loyal

 um to no end and you know he's like any of those movies

 where

 which are about like the the

 mafia

 or whatever where like you know something

 bad's

 going wrong and you need somebody to show up

 that's jcal so if you killed the said proverbial

 homeless

 person he would be right there to

 help you the body yeah

 but

 he's the one that he'll defend

 you in

 every way shape or form even if it's not doesn't

 make sense in that moment he

 doesn't see

 that

 as an action of whether it'll solve the problem he

 sees that as an act of devotion

 to you your friend and

 that's an incredible gift that he gives us

 the other side of it is that you know j cal

 needs

 to learn

 how to trust that other people love him back as much as he loves us foreign

 because

 he assumes that he's not as lovable as the rest of us

 but he's infinitely more lovable than he understands he's i

 mean you have to see lex like he is

 unbelievably

 funny i mean i

 cannot tell you how funny this guy is

 um next level funny yeah his timing timing everything charm the care he takes

 so he is as lovable but he doesn't believe himself to be and

 that manifests itself in areas that drive us all crazy from time to time which

 makes it for a very pleasant listening experience okay so what about the the two

 david's

 deus

 ex and david friedberg

 david

 sacks

 is the one that i would say i

 have the most emotional

 connection with

 um he and i can go a year without talking and

 then we'll talk for four hours straight and

 then we know where

 we are and

 we have this ability to pick up and have a level of intimacy

 with each other and

 i think that's just because i've known david for so long now

 um that i find really comforting

 and then freeburg is this person who i think similar to me had

 a very turbulent upbringing has fought through it to build an incredible life for himself and

 i have this enormous

 respect for his journey i

 don't particularly care about his outcomes to be honest but i just have i

 look at that guy and i think

 and he did it and so if i didn't do it

 um i would be glad that he did it if it makes any sense

 um and you can see that he

 um feels like his entire responsibility is really around his kids

 and just kind of like give a better counterfactual

 and

 and

 you know sometimes i think he gets that right and wrong but

 he's a very special human being that way on that show the

 two of you have a very kind of

 like from a geopolitics perspective i don't know there's just a very

 effective

 way to think deeply about the world the big

 picture of the world he's a very systems level thinker yeah

 very very absolutely

 fairy systems levels very

 rooted in you know a broad body of knowledge which

 i have a tremendous respect for he brings all these things in

 sax is

 incredible because he has this unbelievable

 understanding

 of things but it has a core nucleus

 so

 free bird can just basically abstract

 a whole bunch of systems and talk about it i

 tend to be more like that where i try to kind

 of i

 find it to be more of a puzzle

 socks

 is more like anchored in you know a philosophical and historical context as the answer

 and he starts there but he gets to these profound understandings

 of systems as well on

 the podcast in

 life you guys hold to your opinion pretty strong

 what's

 what's the secret to being able to argue passionately with friends so

 hold your position but

 also not murder each other which

 you guys seem to come close to i

 think it's like strong

 opinions weekly held

 yeah

 like you know like look today you

 and i yeah what

 have we we steel man like the two sides of three different things yeah

 um now you could be confused and think i believe in those things i

 believe that it's important to be able to intellectually traverse

 there whether i believe in it or not and like steel man not superman like that's

 a really but we introde

 those things by saying let us steal men in this position sometimes

 you guys skip the

 we

 skip you're right we we edit

 those things out and sometimes

 we'll sit on either sides

 and we'll just kind of bat

 things back and forth just to see what

 the other person thinks so

 that's how like

 as fans we should listen to that sometimes like so sometimes

 because you hold the strong opinion sometimes

 like for example the cost of energy going to zero

 is that like what's the degree of certainty on that is is this

 kind of like you really

 taking a prediction of how the world will unroll and if it does this will benefit

 a huge amount of companies

 and people that will believe

 that idea so you really you

 you like

 you spend a few days a few weeks with that idea i've

 been spending

 two

 years with that idea and

 that idea has manifested into

 um many pages and pages of more and more branches of a tree

 but

 it started with that idea so if you think about this tree this

 logical tree that i built i would consider it more of a mosaic

 and

 at the at the base or root however you want to talk about it is

 this idea the

 incremental

 cost of energy goes to zero how does it manifest and

 so i talked about one traversal which is the competition of households versus utilities

 but if even some of that comes to pass

 we're going to see a bunch of other implications from a regulatory and technology perspective if

 some of those come to pass so

 i've tried to think think

 sort of this you know six seven eight hops forward

 and i have some like

 to use the chest analogy

 i have a bunch of short lines which i think can work

 um and i've started to test those by making investments

 tens of millions over here to 100 millions over there

 but it's a distribution based on how probabilistic i think this these outcomes are

 and how downside

 protected

 i can be and how much i will learn how

 many mistakes i can make you know etc

 and then very quickly over the next two years some

 of those things will happen or not happen and i will rapidly re-underwrite

 and i'll rewrite that tree

 and then i'll get some more data i'll make some more investments

 and i'll rapidly re-underwrite so

 you know in order for

 me to get to this tree maybe you can ask how did i get there it

 was complete

 accident

 the

 way that it happened was

 i

 have a friend of mine who

 works

 at a great organization

 called fortress

 his

 name is drew

 mcknight

 and

 he called me one

 day and he said hey i'm doing a

 deal will

 you anchor

 it we're going public

 and it's a rare earth mining company and i said drew like if

 i'm going to get tart and feathered in silicon valley for backing a mining company and

 he said just talk to the guy and learn

 and the guy jim lotinski blew me away he's

 like

 here's

 what it means for energy

 and

 here's

 what it means

 for the supply chain

 here's

 what it means for the united states versus china

 but lax i did that deal and then i did seven others

 and that deal made money let's have another

 but i learned i

 made enough mistakes

 where the net of it was

 i got to a thesis that i believed in i could see it

 and i was like okay

 i paid

 the price i

 acquired the learning

 i made my mistakes i know where i am at and

 this is step one

 and

 then i learned a little bit more i made some more investments

 and that's how i that's

 how i do the job that's the

 minute that you try

 to wait for perfection in order to make a bet either on yourself or

 a company

 a girlfriend whatever it's too late so if we just linger on that tree

 it seems like a lot of geopolitics

 a lot of international military even conflict is

 around energy so

 how does

 your thinking about energy connect

 to what you see happening in the next 10 20 years maybe

 you can look at the war in ukraine

 or

 relationship with china and other places through the lens of energy what

 what's the hopeful what's the cynical trajectory

 that the world might take through with this

 drive towards zero energy zero

 cost energy so

 the united states was in a period of energy surplus

 um until the last few years some

 number of years in trump and i think some number of now the current administration

 with president biden

 um but we know what it means

 um to basically have more than enough energy to fund our own domestic

 manufacturing and living standards

 foreign

 and

 i think that by being able to generate this energy from the sun that

 is very capex efficient that

 is very climate efficient

 gives us a huge tailwind

 the second thing is that we are now in a world in a regime for

 many years to come of non-zero interest rates

 and it may interest you to know that the really the last time

 that you know we had long-dated

 wars supported you

 know at

 low interest rates

 was world war ii where i think the average interest rates

 was like 1.07

 in the tenure

 and every other war tends to have these very quick open and closes because

 these long protracted fights

 get very difficult to finance when rates are non-zero

 so just as an example even starting in 2023

 so the practical example today in the united states is president biden's

 budget is

 about 1.5 trillion

 and

 for next year that's

 not including the entitlement spending okay meaning medicare

 social security right so the stuff that he wants to spend that he has discretion

 over is about

 1.582

 trillion is the exact number

 next year our interest payments are going to be 455

 billion dollars that's 29 of every budget dollar is going to pay interest

 so you have these two worlds coming together right lex if you have us

 you know hurtling forward

 to being able to generate our own energy and

 the economic peril that comes with trying to underwrite several

 trillion dollars for war which

 we can't afford to pay when rates are at five percent means

# Chapter 8

 get very difficult to finance when rates are non-zero

 so just as an example even starting in 2023

 to being able to generate our own energy and

 the economic peril that comes with trying to underwrite several

 trillion dollars for war which

 we can't afford to pay when rates are at five percent means

 that despite all the bluster the

 probabilistic distribution of us engaging in war with russia and ukraine seems relatively low

 the the override would obviously be a moral

 reason to do it that

 may or may not come if there's some nuclear proliferation

 but now you have to steal man the

 other side of the equation which is well what were to happen if

 you were sitting there and you were putin

 let's deal man setting

 off a tactical nuke

 someplace

 okay i'm

 getting calls every other day from my two largest energy buyers india and china telling

 me slow my roll

 i have the entire world looking

 to find the final excuse to

 turn me off and unplug me from the entire world economy

 the

 only morally reprehensible

 thing that's left in my arsenal that

 could do all of these things together would be to set off attack nuke

 i would be the only person since world war ii to have done that

 you know it's it seems like it's a really really really

 big

 step to take

 and so i think that

 x of the clamoring for war that the military-industrial complex wants us to buy into

 the financial reasons to do it and the natural reason resources

 needs to do it are making it very unlikely

 that is not just true for us

 i think it's also true for europe i

 think the european

 economy

 is going to roll over

 i think it's going i see a very hard landing for them which

 means that if the economy slows down there's going to be less need for energy

 and

 so it

 starts to become a thing where a negotiated settlement

 is actually the win-win for everybody

 but none of this would be possible without

 zero interest rates in

 a world of zero interest rates we would be in war

 so you believe in the financial

 forces and pressures overpowering i believe in the human lives

 i really do believe in these even in in international war more

 so there i think the invisible hand and

 by the invisible hand for the audience i think really what it means is you

 know the the financial complex

 and really the central bank complex and the interplay between fiscal and monetary policy

 um is a very convoluted and complicated set of things

 but if we had zero interest rates

 we would be probably in the middle of it now

 see there's a complexity to this game at the international

 level where the nation some nations are authoritarian and are there's significant corruption

 and so that adds

 from a game theoretic optimal perspective

 you know the invisible hand has is operating in the mud preventing war

 the

 person the

 person that

 is the most important figure in the world right now is jerome

 powell

 he is probably doing more to prevent more than anybody else

 he keeps ratcheting rates it's just impossible it's a mathematical impossibility for the united states unless

 there is such a cataclysmic

 moral transgression by russia so there is tail risk that it is possible

 where we say forget it all bets are off we're going back to zero rates issue

 a hundred year bond we're going to finance a war machine

 there is a small risk of that but

 i think the propensity of the majority of outcomes is more of a negotiated settlement so

 what about i mean if you what's

 the motivation of putin to invade ukraine in the first place if

 financial

 forces are the most

 um the most powerful forces

 why did it happen because it seems like there's other forces at play of

 maintaining superpower status on the world stage yeah it seems like geopolitics doesn't happen just

 with the invisible hand in

 consideration i agree with that i can't beg to know to be honest i don't know

 um but he did it

 and i think it's easier for me

 to guess the outcome from here it

 would have been impossible for me to really understand it is

 what got him to this place

 but it seems like there's an end game here and there's

 um there's not much playability

 yeah i feel like i'm on a sturdy ground because there's been so many experts at

 every stage of this that have been wrong well there are no experts well on this

 there are no experts lex i

 understand this well okay let's

 dig into that because there's some because we just said phil helmuth is the

 um is the greatest poker player of all time he has an opinion yeah

 he doesn't he's so he would be mistaken hey

 poker

 phil

 has an opinion ivy

 has an opinion as well on how to play all these games

 meaning an opinion means here's the lines i take here are the decisions i make

 i live and die by those and if i'm right i win if i'm wrong i

 lose i've

 made more mistakes than my opponent

 i thought you said there's an optimal

 so aren't there people that have a deeper understand

 a higher likelihood of being able to describe

 and know the optimal the optimal set of actions here at

 every layer well

 they're they're they're being

 theoretically set of optimal decisions but you can't play your life

 um

 against a computer like meaning the minute that you face an opponent and

 that person takes you off that optimal path you have to adjust yeah

 like what happens if a tactical nuke it would be really bad

 um

 i

 think the world is resilient enough i

 think the ukrainians are resilient enough to overcome it it

 would be really bad it's just an it's an incredibly sad moment in human history but

 do you wonder what u.s does

 is there any understanding do you think people inside the united states

 understand not not the regular citizens but people in the military do

 you think joe biden understands do you think i think joe biden does understand i

 think that i think they have a clear plan i think that there are

 few

 reasons to let the gerontocracy

 rule but this is one of the reasons where i think they are better adept

 than other people

 um you know folks that were around during the bay of pigs folks

 that hopefully have studied that and

 studied you know nuclear de-escalation

 we'll have a better playbook than i do my suspicion

 is that

 there is a you know in an emergency break glass plan and

 i think before military intervention or anything else

 i think that there are an enormous number of financial

 sanctions that you can do to just completely cripple russia that they haven't undertaken yet

 um and

 if you couple that with an economic

 system in europe that is less and less in need of energy

 because it is going into a recession it

 makes it easier for them to be able to walk away while

 the u.s ships a bunch of you know lng over there so

 i

 i don't know the game theory on all of this but does it make you nervous

 that

 or we're just being temperamental does

 it feels like the world hangs in a balance like

 it feels like

 at least for my naive perspective

 i

 thought we

 were getting to a place where surely human civilization can't destroy itself and

 here's a presentation of what looks like a hot war or

 multiple parties involved in escalating escalation

 towards a world war is not entirely out of the realm of possibility it's not i

 would really really hope that

 he is spending time with his two young twins

 well this is part

 of

 what i really i really hope he's spending time with his kids

 agreed but not kids not just kids but friends and the the he

 may not have friends but

 it's very hard for anybody to look at their kids and not think about protecting

 the future

 well there's

 um partially

 because of the pandemic but partially because of the nature of power it

 feels like you're surrounded by people you can't trust more and more i

 do think the pandemic had a effect on that too the isolating effect a

 lot of people were not their best selves during the pandemic

 from a super heavy topic let me go back to

 the space where you're one of the most successful people in the world

 how to build companies how to find good companies what it takes

 to

 find good companies

 what it takes to build good companies

 what advice

 do you have for someone who wants to build the next

 super successful startup in the tech space and

 you know have a chance to be impactful like facebook apple

 that's i think that's the key word if your

 precondition is to start something successful you've already failed because

 you're now you're playing somebody else's game what success means is not clear you're

 walking into the woods

 it's murky it's dark it's wet it's raining there's all these animals about

 um there's no comfort there so you better really like hiking

 and

 there's no short way to shortcut that so

 isn't it obvious what successes like success scale

 so it's not what are the no

 i think that there's a very brittle basic definition of success that's outside in

 um but it's not that's not what it is

 um you know i know people that are much much richer than i am

 you know and they are just so completely broken

 and i think to myself the

 only difference between you and me

 is outsider's perception of your wealth versus mine

 but the

 the happiness and the joy that i have in the simple basic routines of my life

 give me enormous joy

 and so

 i feel successful no matter what anybody says about my success or lack of success

 um there are people

 that live normal lives that have good jobs that have good families you

 know i've this like idyllic sense like

 i see it on tick tock all the time so i know it exists these

 neighborhoods where there's like a cul-de-sac and these beautiful homes and these kids are biking around

 and every time i see that lex i immediately flash back to

 what i didn't have

 and i think that's success look

 at how happy those kids are

 so no you there is no one definition and

 so if people are starting out to try to make a

 million dollars 100 million dollars a billion dollars you're gonna fail

 there's a definition of personal success but is there's also some level of

 um that's different from person to person but there's also some level of

 the

 responsibility

 you have if there's a mission to have a positive impact on the world so

 i'm not sure that elon is happy no

 in

 fact i think if you focus

 on trying

 to have an impact

 on

 the world i

 think you're going to end up deeply

 unhappy

 but does that matter

 like what may happen what happens it may happen as a byproduct

 but i think that you should strive to find your own personal happiness and then measure

 how that manifests as it relates to society and to other people but

 if the answer to those questions is zero that

 doesn't make you less of a person no

 100 but then the other way is

 there are times when you need to sacrifice your own personal happiness

 force

 for

 a bigger thing for that you've created yeah if you're if you're in a position to

 do it i

 think some folks are tested elon is probably the best example and

 it must be really really hard to be him

 um really hard i have

 enormous

 levels of empathy

 and care for

 him i really love him as a person because

 i just see that it's not like it's not that fun

 and and he has these ways of

 being human that

 in his position i just think are so dear

 that if he never i

 just hope he never loses them just a simple example like two

 days ago

 i don't know why but i

 went on twitter and i saw the perfume

 thing yeah so i'm like ah

 fuck it i'm just gonna go buy some perfume so

 i bought his perfume the burnt hair thing yeah

 and i said and

 i emailed him the receipt and i'm like all right you got me for a bottle

 um and he

 responded

 in like eight seconds and it was just a smiley face or whatever yeah just

 deeply normal things that you do amongst people that are just so nobody sees that

 you know what i mean but it would be

 he

 deserves

 for that stuff to be seen because the

 rest of his life is so brutally hard yeah

 um he's just a normal guy that is just caught in this ultra mega vortex

 why do you think there's so few elons

 it's an extremely lonely set of trade-offs

 because to your point if you get tested

 so if you think about it again probabilistically

 there's eight billion people in the world maybe

 50 of them get put in a position where they are building something of such colossal

 importance that

 they even have this choice

 and then of that 50 maybe

 10 of them are put in a moment where they actually have to make a trade-off

 you

 know you're

 not going to be able to see your fam i'm

 making this up you're

 not going to be able to see your family

 you're

 not you

 know you're going to have to basically

 move

 into your

 factory you're

 gonna have to sleep on

 the floor but

 here's the outcome energy independence

 and you know resource abundance and peace

 you know a massive peace dividend

 and

 then he says to himself i

 don't know that he did because i've never had this combo

 yeah

 you know what that's worth it

 and like and then you look at your kids and you're like

 i'm making this decision i don't know how to explain that to you

 yeah

 you want to be in that position there's

 no there's no amount of money where i would want to be in that position so

 that

 takes an enormous fortitude and a moral compass

 that he has and that's what i think people need to need

 to appreciate about that guy it's

# Chapter 9

 factory you're

 gonna have to sleep on

 the floor but

 here's the outcome energy independence

 and you know resource abundance and peace

 you know a massive peace dividend

 and

 then he says to himself i

 don't know that he did because i've never had this combo

 yeah

 you know what that's worth it

 and like and then you look at your kids and you're like

 i'm making this decision i don't know how to explain that to you

 yeah

 you want to be in that position there's

 no there's no amount of money where i would want to be in that position so

 that

 takes an enormous fortitude and a moral compass

 that he has and that's what i think people need to need

 to appreciate about that guy it's

 also on the first number he said it's confusing that there's 50 people or

 10 people

 like that are put in the position to have that level of impact it's unclear

 that that has to be that way it seems like there

 could be much more

 there should be there's definitely people with the potential

 um but you know think about think about his journey you know his

 mom had to leave a very complicated environment moved

 to canada moved

 to toronto you

 know a small apartment

 just north of bain bloor you know if you've ever been to toronto

 um i remember talking

 to her about this apartment is

 so crazy because i used to live like around the corner from that place and

 raise these three kids and just have to so

 how many people are going to start with those boundary conditions

 you know and really grind it out it's just very few people in the end that

 um will have the resiliency to stick it through where

 you don't give in to the self-doubt

 and

 so it you know it's a really it's

 just a really hard set of boundary conditions

 where you can have 50

 or 100 of these people that's why they needed to be really they

 need to be really appreciated

 yeah well that's true for all humans that

 follow

 the the threat of their passion

 and do something beautiful

 in this world that could be in a small scale or a big scale

 appreciation

 is a

 that's

 a gift you give to the other person but also a gift to yourself that's

 somehow it becomes

 like this

 contagious

 thing i went to this

 you

 are so right you just like it my my brain just lit up because yesterday

 i went to an investor day of my friend of mine

 um describe

 brad gerstner and

 you know on the one very reductive world brad

 and i are theoretically competitors but

 we're not he

 makes his own set of decisions i make my own set of decisions we're

 both trying to do our own view of what is good work in the world

 but he's been profoundly successful

 and

 it

 was really the first moment of my

 adult life where i could sit in a moment like that

 and really be appreciative of his success and not feel less then

 and so you know little selfishly for me but mostly for him as well

 i was so proud to be in the room that's

 my friend that

 guy plays poker with me every thursday he

 is crushing it it's awesome you

 know and that's the it's a it's a really amazing feeling

 i mean to to linger on the the trade-offs the complicated trade-offs with all this

 what's your take on work-life balance in in a in a company that's trying to do

 big things

 i think that you have to have some very very strict boundaries

 but otherwise i think balance is kind of dumb

 it will make you limited

 i think you need to immerse yourself in the problem

 but you need to define that immersion with boundaries

 so

 if you you know if you ask me like you know what does like my process

 look

 like

 it's monotonous and regimented but it's all the time except

 when it's not and that's also monotonous

 and regimented

 um and i think that makes me very good at my craft

 because it gives me what i need

 to stay connected to the problem without feeling resentful about the problem which

 part the monotonous all in nature of it or

 the the when you say hard boundaries essentially

 go

 all out until you stop and

 you don't stop often i'm in a little bit of a quandary right now

 because i'm trying to redefine my goals

 and you're catching me in a moment where

 i have even in these last few years of evolution i

 think i've made some good progress

 but in one very specific way i'm still very reptilian

 and i'm trying to let go which was that exactly if

 you can you know in my business it

 really gets reduced

 to what is your annual rate of compounding

 that's my demarcation

 you know

 steph curry and lebron james michael jordan it's how many points did you average not

 just in a season

 but over your career

 you know and in their case to really be the greatest of all time

 its points rebounds assists steals there's all kinds of measures

 to be you know in that pantheon of being really really good at your craft

 um and in my business it's very reductive it's how well have you compounded

 and if you look at all the heroes that

 i have put on a pedestal in my mind

 um they've compounded you know at above 30 percent for a very long time

 as have i

 but

 now i feel like i really need to let go because i

 think i know how to do the basics of my job

 and

 if i had to summarize like an investing challenge or investing

 i think really it's you know when you first start out investing

 you're

 a momentum person you saw it in gamestop just a bunch of people aping each other

 and then it goes from momentum

 to

 you

 start to think about cash flows

 you know how much profit is this person going to make whatever so

 that's like the evolution

 you know this is the this is the basic thing

 to this is a reasonably sophisticated way then

 a much smaller group of people think about it in terms of macro geopolitics

 but then a very finite few cracked

 this special code which is there's a philosophy and

 it's the philosophy that creates the system

 and i'm scratching

 at that furiously

 but i cannot

 break through

 and

 i

 haven't broken

 through

 and

 i know that

 in order to break through i

 gotta let go

 so this is the journey that i'm in as in my in my professional life

 so it is an all-consuming thing but

 i'm always home for dinner

 you know we have very prescribed moments where we take vacation the

 weekends

 you

 know like if i i

 can tell you about my

 week if

 you're curious

 but it's like i would love i

 would love to know your week it's since it's regimented

 and

 monotonous i woke up i wake up at 6 45.

 um

 get the kids go downstairs we

 all have some form of you

 know not super healthy breakfast i make a latte i've become in and and the

 latte is like i have a machine i

 measure the beans you

 know i

 make sure that

 the timer is

 such where

 i have to pull it for a certain specific

 ratio

 you

 know just so you know 20 grams

 i gotta pull 30 grams

 with the water and i got you know i got to do it

 30

 seconds

 etc so your

 coffee snob it helps me stay in rhythm sure

 um before i used to have another machine i just pushed a button yeah

 but then i would push the button religiously

 in the exact same way you

 know what i mean because

 actually

 on that topic

 you know the morning with kids can be pretty stressful thing

 are

 you able to find sort of happiness

 is that also that morning is a source of happiness it's great my

 kids are lovely their

 maniacs

 um

 i just see

 you know and maybe i

 don't i've never asked friedberg this but i'll just put

 my words i

 see all of the things in moments

 where

 there was no compassion given to me and

 so i just give him a ton of love

 and compassion i have an infinite patience for my children not for other kids yes

 of course but for a lot of kids so anyway so we have a breakfast thing

 um and then i go upstairs

 um and i go i change and i and i work out from eight to nine

 and that's like the first 15 minutes i

 walk up on a steep incline you know

 12 to 14 you know three and a half to four miles per hour walk

 and then you know monday's a push day tuesdays

 front of the legs wednesdays pull thursdays back of the legs

 um eight

 to nine

 monday

 i

 always start

 i

 talk to my therapist

 from nine to ten

 so

 as soon as i finish working

 out

 i

 get on the phone and

 i talk to him

 and

 it helps me lock in for the for the

 for the week

 and i and i and i'm just talking about the past

 um and it's just helping me the recent past usually

 sometimes

 the recent past but usually it's about the past past

 something that i remember when i was a kid

 because that's the work about just loosening those knots you

 know so i put in that hour of work

 um respect that hour

 but then i'm in the office and then it's like you know i go until

 12 15 12 30.

 go home

 have lunch

 like

 a proper like go home sit down have lunch with nat talk she

 leaves her work

 can we talk how are we doing you know just check in our

 youngest daughter will be there because she's one

 and she's making a mess

 and then i i'll have another coffee

 that's it my limit for the day oh no more caffeine that's it and then

 i go back to the office and i'll be there until six seven sometimes

 and i do that monday tuesday wednesday thursday monday

 tuesday thursday friday i'm allowed to have meetings wednesday

 nothing it's all reading must

 be unless it's a complete emergency it has to be

 kind of a full reading and reading is a bunch of blogs

 youtube videos so i'm not trying not to do any talking no

 talking it's like being in silence being present thinking

 about things by

 the way how do you take notes give

 us a

 sketch i have a pad and i write stuff down sometimes

 i go to my phone i'm a little all over the place sometimes

 i do google docs i

 don't have this is one thing i need to get better at actually

 but typically what happens is i

 actually do a lot of thinking in my mind and

 i'm sort of filing a lot of stuff away and

 then it all spills out and then i have to write

 and then that gives me a body of work that i can evaluate

 and think about and then i usually put it away

 um and a lot of the time it goes nowhere but

 every now and then i come back to it and it just unlocks

 two or three things and i have a sense of how

 else i'm thinking about things

 um and then friday at the end of the day

 nat and i talk to a couple's therapists

 um and that's about checking out properly

 so it's like okay now it's like focusing the weekend is family

 being present being aware you know and

 if there's email obviously if i have to do meetings from time to time no problem

 um but there's boundaries checking out properly

 um oh man that is so powerful just like yeah officially transitioning yeah

 so these are these are really important

 boundaries

 so

 that i can be immersed and

 what that means is like look on a saturday afternoon you

 know on a random day she'll

 be like where's your mouth and i'll be up in my room and

 i've found a podcast talking

 about like

 um

 decis which is like ductal cancer in situ because i've been fascinated about breast cancer surgeries

 for a while and

 learning about that and

 she's like what are you doing i'm like i'm listening to podcasts about decis and

 she's like what's that like you know ductal cancer in c2

 she's like okay

 and so you know i so i have time to continue to just constantly learning

 learning putting stuff in my memory banks to

 organize into something and that's like a that's a week

 but then in these fixed moments of time

 phone down everything down we go on vacation you know

 we go on a boat we go to whatever where it's just us and the kids

 is there a structure when you're at work is

 there instructed to your day in terms of meetings in terms of south side of wednesday

 you

 know because you're having to keep meetings to less than 30 minutes

 have to

 and

 you know oftentimes

 meetings

 can be as short as like 10 or 15 minutes because then i'm just like okay

 because i'm trying to reinforce

 that

 it's very rare that we all have something really important to say

 and so the ritual that is becomes really valuable to get scale

 is not the ritual of meetings but the ritual of respecting

 the collective time of the unit

 and

 so it's like you know what folks

 i'm going to assume

 that you guys are also tackling

 really important

 projects

 you

 also want to have good boundaries

 in this immersion go back to your kids and have dinner with them every night it's

 not just for me it's for you so how about this why

 don't you go and do your work this

 painting didn't need to be 30 minutes it could be five and

 the rest of the time is yours and and

 it's

 weird because when people join

 that system at social capital they just

 it's

 like face time and it's like let me make sure and

 let me talk a lot so

 i can't say anything i

 respect

 the person that

 says

 nothing for

 two years and

 the first thing that they say is not obvious

 that

 person is immensely more valuable than the person that tries to talk all the time

 what

 have you learned from your

 um so after facebook you

 started social capital or what what is

 now called social capital what

 have you learned from all

 the successful investing you've done there

 about investing or about life yeah or about running a team if

 i'm very loath to give advice because i think it so

 much of it is situational but

 my observation is that starting a business is really hard any kind of business

 and most people don't know what they're doing

 and as a result we make enormous

 mistakes

 but i would summarize this and this may be a little heterodoxical

 i think there are only three kinds of mistakes because

 if we go back to what we said before in the business

 it's just learning

 you're exploring the dark space to get to the answer faster than other people

 and those the mistakes that you make are three

 or the three kinds of decisions let's say you'll hire somebody and

 they're really really really average but they're a really good person oh yeah you'll hire somebody

 and they really weren't candid with who they are and

 their real personality and their morality and their ethics only expose them

 over a long period of time

 and then you hire somebody and

# Chapter 10

 the successful investing you've done there

 about investing or about life yeah or about running a team if

 i'm very loath to give advice because i think it so

 much of it is situational but

 my observation is that starting a business is really hard any kind of business

 and most people don't know what they're doing

 and as a result we make enormous

 mistakes

 but i would summarize this and this may be a little heterodoxical

 i think there are only three kinds of mistakes because

 you're exploring the dark space to get to the answer faster than other people

 and those the mistakes that you make are three

 or the three kinds of decisions let's say you'll hire somebody and

 they're really really really average but they're a really good person oh yeah you'll hire somebody

 and they really weren't candid with who they are and

 their real personality and their morality and their ethics only expose them

 over a long period of time

 and then you hire somebody and

 they're not that good

 morally but they're highly performant

 what do you do with those three things

 and i think successful companies

 have figured out how to answer those three things because those are the things

 that in my opinion determine

 success and failure so it's basically hiring and you just identified

 three

 failure cases for hiring but very different failure

 cases and very complicated ones right like the highly performant person who's

 not that great as

 a human being do

 you keep them around well

 a lot of people would air towards keeping that person around what

 is the right answer i don't know it's the context of the situation

 um and the second one is also very tricky

 what

 about if they really turned out that they were just not candid

 with

 who

 they

 are

 and

 it

 took

 you

 a

 long

 time

 to

 figure

 out

 who

 you

 were

 these

 are all mistakes of the senior person that's running this organization

 i think if you can learn to manage those situations well

 those

 are the real edge cases where you can make mistakes that are fatal to a company

 yeah that's what i've learned over 11 and a half years honestly

 otherwise the business of investing

 i feel that it's like a it's a secret

 and if you are willing to just keep chipping away

 you'll peel back enough of these you know

 layers

 will come off and you'll see if the scales will come off and you'll eventually

 see it i

 really struggle with maybe you can be my therapist for a little bit well

 that first case which you originally mentioned because

 i love people i see the good in people i

 really struggle with just a mediocre performing

 person who's who's a good human being

 that's a tough one

 i'll let you off the hook yeah i think those are incredibly important and useful people

 i think that if a company is like a body they

 are like cartilage can you replace cartilage

 yeah

 but would you if he didn't have to no

 okay can i can i play devil's advocate yeah so those folks

 because of their goodness make it okay to be mediocre

 they they create a culture where well we what's important in life which

 is something i agree in my personal life is

 to be good to each other to be friendly to be good

 vibes all that kind of stuff you

 know when i was at

 google just like the good atmosphere everyone's playing and just it's fun fun right

 um but to me

 like

 when i when i put on my hat of like having a mission and a goal

 what

 i

 love to see is the superstars

 that shine for some in some way like do something incredible

 and i want everyone

 to

 also

 admire

 that those superstars and perhaps not just for the productivity's

 sake or performing

 or successful company's sake but because that too is

 an incredible thing that humans are able to accomplish which

 is shine i hear you but that's not a decision you make meaning you

 get lucky when you have those people in your company

 that's

 not the hard part for you the

 hard part is figuring out what to do with one two and three yeah keep

 demote

 promote fire what do you do

 and

 this is why it's all about those three buckets i

 personally believe that folks in that bucket one

 as long as those folks aren't more than 50 to 60 percent of a company are

 good

 and they can be managed as

 long as they

 are one

 to two degrees away

 from

 one of those people that you just mentioned yeah

 yeah

 because it's easy then to drag the entire company down if

 they're too far away from

 the lebron james because

 you don't know what lebron

 james looks

 and feels and smells and you

 know so

 you need that tactile sense of what excellence looks like in front of you

 a

 great example

 is if you like if you just go on youtube and

 you search these

 clips of how

 kobe

 bryant's teammates described

 not

 kobe

 but how their own behavior

 not performance

 because

 there's a bunch of average people that kobe played with this whole career but

 their behavior changed

 by being somewhat

 closer to him and i think that's an important psychological

 thing to note for how you can do reasonably good team construction if

 you're lucky enough to find those generational talents

 you have to find a composition of a team that keeps them roughly close

 to enough of the org that way that

 group of people

 can continue to add value and then you'll have courage to

 fire these

 next two groups of people and

 i think the answer is to fire those two groups of people because

 no matter how good you are that stuff just injects

 poison into a into

 a living organism

 and that living organism will die when exposed to poison

 so

 would you invest in a lot of companies you've looked at a lot of companies what

 do you think makes for a good leader so

 we talked about building a team but

 a good leader for a company what are the qualities

 you know i

 um when i first meet people

 um i never asked to see a resume

 um

 and when i'm meeting a company ceo

 for the first time i couldn't care less about the business in

 fact

 um and i try to take the time

 to let them reveal themselves now

 in this environment you know i'm doing most of the talking but

 if this were the other way around and you were ever raising

 capital and usage math i'd be interested in you looking at this business

 i'd probably say eight to ten words

 for hours and just listen prod you

 know i throw things out prod and let you meander and

 in you meandering i'm trying to build a sense of who this person is once

 i have a rough sense of that which

 is not necessarily right but it's a starting point

 then i can go and understand why

 this

 idea makes sense in this moment and

 what i'm really trying to do is just kind of like unpack

 where are the biases that

 may make you you know fail

 and then we go back to you

 the thing that silicon

 valley has

 the benefit of though is that they don't have to do any of this stuff

 if there's momentum because then the

 rule book goes out the window and people clamor to invest so

 one of the things that i do

 and this is again back to this pugilism that i inflict on myself

 is i have these two things that i look at thing

 number one is

 i have a table that

 says

 how much did we make from all of our best investments

 how

 much did we lose from all of our worst investments what

 is the ratio of winners to losers over 11 years

 and

 in our case it's 23 to 1.

 on you know billions of dollars so you can you can kind of like you

 can see a lot of signal

 but what that allows me to do is really like say wait a minute like

 we

 cannot violate these

 rules around how

 much money we're willing to commit in an errant personality you

 know the

 second is i ask myself of

 all the other top vcs in silicon valley name them all you know

 um what's our correlation meaning

 when i do a deal how

 often does anybody from sequoia excel benchmark kleiner who you name it

 do it at the same time or after

 and vice versa

 and

 then then

 i look at the data to see how much they do it amongst themselves

 what's a good sign i'm at zero as

 virtually close to zero as possible that's a good thing well

 it's not a good thing when the markets are way way up because it creates

 an

 enormous amount of momentum so i have to make money the hard way

 i

 have to you know because i'm trafficking and things that are highly uncorrelated

 to the the gestalt of silicon valley which can be a lonely business

 but it's really valuable in moments where markets get crushed because correlation

 is the first thing that causes massive destruction of of capital massive

 because one person all of a sudden with one blow up in one company boom

 the contagion hits everybody except

 the person that was you know not and so now

 those are like more sophisticated elements of risk management which is again this pugilism

 that i inflict on my nobody asks

 me to do that nobody

 actually at

 some level when the markets are up really care that

 when markets are sideways or when markets are down i think that

 that allows me to feel proud of our process

 you know but that requires you to think a

 lot a lot outside the box it's lonely because you're taking risks also your

 public personality so you say stuff that

 if it's wrong you get yelled at for constantly for

 for being i mean your mistakes aren't private no and that's something that

 um has been a really really healthy

 moment of growth

 it's like an athlete you know

 if you really want to be a winner you got to hit the shot

 in front of the fans

 and if you miss it you

 have to be willing to take the responsibility

 of the fact that you bricked it

 and

 over time hopefully

 there's a body of work that

 says you've

 generally hit more than you've missed

 but if you look at even the best shooters what are they 52 percent

 so these are razor thin margins at the end of the day which

 is really so then what can you control

 i can't control the defense i can't control what they throw up me i

 can just control my preparation

 and whether i'm in the best position to

 launch a reasonable shot

 you said that the world's first trillionaire would be somebody in climate change in the past

 um let's update that what's

 today as we stand here today what sector will the world's first trillionaire

 come from yeah i think it's energy transition so

 energy so the things we've been talking about yeah really

 so isn't it okay well i think i think the way that i think about so

 this is a single division it's hard to interrupt you see their

 ability to actually build a company that makes huge

 amount of money as

 opposed to this distributed

 idea that you've been talking about yeah i'll give you my philosophy

 on wealth

 um most of it is not you

 um an enormous amount of it is

 the genetic distribution of being born in the right place and blah blah irrespective

 of the boundary conditions of how you were born or

 where you were raised right so you

 know at the end of the day you and i ended

 up in the united states

 it's

 a huge benefit to us

 second is the benefit of our age

 it's much better and

 much more likely to be successful as a 46 year old in 2023 than

 a 26 year old in 2023

 because

 in my case i have demographics

 working for me

 with a 26 year old he

 or she has demographics

 working slightly against them can you explain that a little bit what

 are the demographics here

 in the case of me

 the

 distribution of population in america looks like a pyramid

 and in that pyramid

 i'm swedged in between these two massive population cohorts

 the boomers and then these you know gen z and millennials

 um and that's a very advantageous

 position it's not dissimilar to the position that buffett was where he was you

 know packaged

 in between boomers beneath him and the silent generation above him and

 being in between two massive population cohorts

 turns out to be extremely advantageous because when

 the cohort above you transitions power and capital and all of this stuff you're

 the next person that likely gets handed it so we have a disproportionate

 likelihood to be you know we are lucky to be older than younger

 um so that's that's an advantage

 and then the other advantage

 that has nothing to do with me

 is that i stumbled into technology

 i got a degree in electrical

 engineering and i ended up coming to silicon valley

 and

 it turned out that in that moment it was such a transformational wind of change that

 was at my back right so

 the wealth that one creates is

 a huge part of those variables and then the last variable is your direct contributions

 in that moment and the reason why

 that can create extreme wealth is because when those things come together at the right moment

 it's like a chemical reaction i mean it's just crazy so

 that was sort of part number one of what i wanted to say the

 second thing is when you look then inside

 of these systems where you have all these tailwinds

 right so in tech i think i benefit from these three big tail ones

 if

 you build the company or are part of a company or a part of a movement

 your economic participation

 tends to be a direct byproduct

 of the actual value that that thing creates in the world

 and that the thing that that creates in the world will be bigger

 if it is not just an economic system but it's like a philosophical system

 it changes the way the governance happens it changes the way that people think

 about all kinds of other things about their lives

 so there's a reason

 i think why database companies are worth acts social companies are worth why but

 the military industrial complex is worth you know as much

 and i think there's a reason why that

 if you for example were to go off and build some

 newfangled

 source of energy that's clean and hyper abundant

 and safe

 that what you're really going to displace

 or reshape is trillions

 and trillions of dollars of worldwide gdp so the global gdp is

 i call it 85 trillion right it's going at two to three percent a year

 so in the next 10 years we'll be dealing with a hundred trillion dollars of gdp

 right somebody who develops clean energy in 2035

 will probably shift 10 of that around 10 trillion dollars

 a company can easily capture thirty percent of a market three trillion dollars

 a human being can typically own a third of one of these companies one trillion dollars

 so

 you can kind of get to this answer where

 it's like it's

 going to happen in our lifetime

 but you have to i think find these systems that are so gargantuan

 and they exist today

# Chapter 11

 and i think there's a reason why that

 if you for example were to go off and build some

 newfangled

 source of energy that's clean and hyper abundant

 and safe

 that what you're really going to displace

 or reshape is trillions

 and trillions of dollars of worldwide gdp so the global gdp is

 i call it 85 trillion right it's going at two to three percent a year

 so in the next 10 years we'll be dealing with a hundred trillion dollars of gdp

 right somebody who develops clean energy in 2035

 will probably shift 10 of that around 10 trillion dollars

 a company can easily capture thirty percent of a market three trillion dollars

 a human being can typically own a third of one of these companies one trillion dollars

 so

 you can kind of get to this answer where

 it's like it's

 going to happen in our lifetime

 but you have to i think find these systems that are so gargantuan

 and they exist today

 it's more bounded because price discovery takes longer and

 an existing thing it's more unbounded

 because you know what it is you know the tentacles

 that energy reaches

 right of that 80 trillion dollars of worldwide gdp i

 bet you if you added up all the energy companies

 but

 then you added up all of manufacturing

 you know if you added up all of transport you'd

 probably get to like 60 of the 80.

 do you have an idea of which energy

 which alternate energy sustainable energy is the most promising well i think that we

 have to do a better job of exploring

 what i call the suburbs of the periodic table

 so

 you know we're really good in seattle you know the upper northwest yes

 you know we're kind of good in portland

 but we're not existent in san diego and we have zero plan for

 north carolina through florida

 yeah and so is

 that a fancy way of saying nuclear is should be part of the discussion

 i think nuclear i think room temperature semiconductors

 i'm

 i'm not convinced right now that the existing set of nuclear solutions will

 do a good job of scaling beyond bench scale i

 think there is a lot of complicated technical

 problems

 that make

 it work at a bench scale level even partially but the energy equation

 is going to be very difficult to overcome in the absence

 of some leaps

 in material science

 have

 you seen any leaps

 is there promising

 stuff like you're

 you're seeing the cutting edge from a company perspective

 yeah i

 would say not yet i

 do but the precursor

 yes i

 have been spending a

 fair amount of time so talking about like a new framework that's in my mind is

 around these room temp superconductors

 um and so i've been kind of bumbling around in that forest

 for about a year

 i

 haven't really put together any

 meaningful perspectives but again talking about like trafficking

 in in companies and investments that are very lonely but they allow me to generate returns

 that are relatively unique and independent

 that's

 an area where i don't see anybody else when i'm there i'll

 give you another area

 you know we

 um i think are about to unleash in a world of zero energy and and

 zero compute costs

 computational biology will replace white chemistry

 and when you do that you will be able to iterate on tools

 that will be able to solve a lot of human disease

 i think like if you look at the head

 of like the top 400 most recurring rare diseases

 i think like half the number 200

 is

 a specific point mutation as

 just the mismethylation between c and t

 i mean that's like whoa wait you're telling me in billions

 of lines of code i

 forgot you know semicolon

 right there that's

 causing

 this the whole thing to miscompile

 so i just got to go in there and boom and it's all done that's

 a crazy idea that was a c plus plus c

 c throwback for people that don't know there's two people who are two people there everybody

 it's perfect sense um but but

 um so

 that couldn't that be a truly a source of the competition

 biology unlocks

 i mean obviously medicine is

 begging

 for the

 thing with energy

 though

 is that the groundwork

 is well laid

 um and talking about sort of like the upper bound is well defined

 the upper bound in medicine is not well defined because it is not

 the

 sum total of the market cap of the pharma industries it

 is actually the sum total of the value of human life

 and that's an extremely ethical and moral question isn't there special

 interests that are resisting

 moving

 making progress on the energy side so like

 governments

 and

 how do you break through that i mean you have to acknowledge

 the reality

 of that i think it's less governments

 in fact like i said i think president biden

 has done a

 really incredible job while chuck schumer really is done a really incredible job because

 so just to give you the math on this right like back to this so

 three percent of everything is of a market or zealots

 but when you get past five percent things

 tend to just go nuclear

 to 50 60 percent

 the way that they wrote this last bill

 the

 cost

 i'll just use cars as an example the cost of an average car is

 22 and a half thousand the

 cost of the cheapest battery car is thirty thousand and

 lo and behold there's a seventy five hundred dollar credit and it's like to

 think the invisible hand didn't

 know that that math was

 right i

 think is kind of a little bit malarkey

 and

 so the

 battery ev

 car

 is going to be the same price

 as

 the

 thing and

 it's going to go to 40

 50

 percent

 um so we're already at this tipping point so we're kind of ready to go

 um

 in these other markets it's a little bit more complicated because there's a lot of infrastructure

 that needs to get built so you

 know the the gene editing thing as an example you

 know we have to build a tool chain

 that looks more like

 um code that you can write to facebook is written in i think php originally

 hbo which

 is i'm

 still a big fan of sometimes

 you have to use the ugly solution and

 make it look good versus trying

 to come up with a good solution

 um which will be too late let

 me ask you you consider a run for governor of california then decided against it what

 went into each of these decisions and

 broadly i should have maybe a selfish question about silicon

 valley

 is it over as a world leader for new tech companies

 as a this beacon of promise of

 young minds stepping in and creating something that changes the world

 i don't know if those two questions are connected so

 it's not it's not over but

 i think it's definitely

 we're in a challenging moment

 because

 so back to that analogy of the demographics if

 you think about the like if you bucketed forget like our

 relative successes

 but there's a bunch of us in this

 mid 50s to mid 30s cohort of people that

 have now been around you

 know for 20 years 15 years to 25 years that have done stuff right

 from andreessen to zoc to jack dorsey

 etc elon you know whatever maybe you throw me in the mix david sacks whatever okay

 none of us have done a really good job of becoming a statesman

 um or a states woman you know

 um and really showing a broad empathy and awareness for the broader systems

 so silicon valley is to survive as a system

 we need to know that we've transitioned from move fast and break things to

 get

 to the right answer and take your time if that's what it means

 and so we have to be a participant of the system

 and i believe that and i think that it's important to

 not be a dilettante and not be thumbing your face to washington

 or

 not push the boundaries and say you know we'll deal with it after the fact but

 to work with folks that are trying to do the best again

 steel man their point of view

 you know work with them potentially

 run for office so

 potentially like be you know understand

 the system it makes me

 sad that there's no

 tech

 people or not many tech people in congress and certainly not in the presidential level not

 many governors or senators well

 i think that we also have roughly

 you know our rules will

 never allow

 some of the best and brightest folks to run for president because

 of just the rules

 against it but you know if

 if oh you mean yeah yeah i mean like more than this i think david sacks

 would be an incredible presidential

 candidate now i

 also think he'd be a great governor no he was born in south africa

 you know i think he'd be a great governor i think he'd be a great

 um secretary of state i mean he'd be great at whatever he wanted to do

 um you know friedberg you know wasn't born here

 um so there's there's a lot of people that could contribute at

 different levels and i hope that

 by the way the other thing i like about the pod is like i

 also think it helps normalize

 tech a little bit because

 you just see like normal people dealing

 with normal situations

 um and

 i think that that's good you

 know it is a really normative place it's not the caricature

 that it's made out to be but there

 is a small virul and strain of people that make it caricature-like

 with this in one direction what do you think about the whole

 culture of

 um i don't know if better turns but woke activism so sort of activism

 which

 in some contexts is a powerful and important thing but infiltrating

 companies

 i'll

 answer this in the context of renee

 gerard so like he

 says that people tend to copy

 each other

 and

 then when

 they're copying

 each other they're

 really what they're fighting what they're doing is they're fighting over some

 scarce

 resource

 and then you find a way to organize against you know the group of you

 against

 a

 person or

 a thing that you think is the

 actual

 cause

 of all of this conflict

 and you try to expel

 them

 the thing that wokeism doesn't understand

 is that unless that person is truly to blame the cycle just continues

 and

 you know that was a that

 was a framework

 that he developed that you know he's really conclusively

 proven to be true and it's observable in humanity in life

 so these movements i think the extreme left and the extreme right

 are trying to interpret away to allow people to compete for some scarce resource

 but

 i also think that in all of that what they don't realize

 is that they can scapegoat

 whoever they want but

 it's not going to work because the

 the bull work of people in the middle realize

 that it's just not true

 yeah they realize

 but they're still because in leadership positions

 there's still momentum

 and they still scapegoat

 and they continue

 and it seems to hurt the actual ability is more successful in

 fairness though if you had to graph the effectiveness of that function it's

 decaying rapidly it's

 the least effective it's ever been you're

 absolutely right being canceled five years ago was a huge deal

 today i think it was jordan peterson on your podcast he

 said i've been canceled and it was amazing he said 38

 times or 40 he said some number which was a ginormous number a

 that he kept account of it and b was able to classify

 it yeah i'm like what classifier

 is going on in his mind where

 he's like ah

 that's an attempt to cancel me but this one is not but my point is

 was clearly not working

 and

 so the guy

 is still there and the guy is you know putting his view out into the world

 um and

 so it's not what

 not to judge whether what

 he says is right or wrong

 it's just to observe that this mechanism mechanism of action is now weakened but

 it's weakened because it's not the thing that people think is really to blame yeah

 you've

 been canceled on

 a small scale a few times so let's not i'm

 sure it didn't feel small actually

 it wasn't small i'm trying to minimize

 did that did that psychologically hurt you yeah

 it was tough i mean in the moment you don't know what's going on but

 i would like to thank a certain ceo of

 a certain well-known company

 and he sent me

 basically like a step-by-step

 manual

 and does it involve mushrooms no no and

 and he was right

 you know the

 storm passed and life went on is

 it

 i don't know if you can share the the list

 of steps but is the fundamental core idea

 is that just

 life

 goes on

 the

 the core fundamental idea is like you need to be willing

 and able to apologize

 for what is in your control but not for other people's mistakes

 your mistakes yes and if you feel like there's something then

 you should take accountability

 of that

 but to apologize for somebody else for

 something that they want to hear

 isn't

 going to solve anything

 yeah there's something about apologies

 if you do them they should be authentic

 to what you actually want to say versus

 what somebody else needs to wants to hear

 otherwise

 it doesn't ring true yeah

 and people can see through that and people can see through it and also what

 people see through is not just the fact that you

 know your

 apology was somewhat hollow

 but

 also that this entire majority of people now walked away the mob was like okay thanks

 yeah and then people are like also you didn't care at all this is like

 and so then it reflects more broadly on them yeah

 i

 know you said you don't like to give advice but

 what advice would you give to a young person

 you've

 lived an incredible life from very humble beginnings difficult childhood and

 you're one of the most successful people in the world so what advice i

 mean a lot of people look to you for inspiration

 kids in high school or early college they're not doing good or

 um are trying to figure out basically

 what to do when they have complete doubt in themselves what advice would you give them

 it is really important that if somebody

 that

 you respect and i'm gonna just

 for the purpose of this put myself in that bucket and if you're listening to this

 um i wish somebody had told this to me

 um we are all equal

 and you

 will fight this demon inside you that says you are less than a

 lot of other people

 for reasons that will be hard to see until you're much much older

 and so you have to find

 either a set of people far far away like what i did

 or one or two people really really close to you or maybe it's both

 that will remind you in key moments of your life that that is true otherwise

 you will give in to that beast

 and

 it's

 not the end of the world and

 you'll recover from it i've made a lot of mistakes

 but it requires a lot of energy

 and sometimes it's just easier to just stop and give up

 so

 i think that if you're starting out in the world if

# Chapter 12

 for the purpose of this put myself in that bucket and if you're listening to this

 um i wish somebody had told this to me

 um we are all equal

 and you

 will fight this demon inside you that says you are less than a

 lot of other people

 for reasons that will be hard to see until you're much much older

 and so you have to find

 either a set of people far far away like what i did

 or one or two people really really close to you or maybe it's both

 that will remind you in key moments of your life that that is true otherwise

 you will give in to that beast

 and

 it's

 not the end of the world and

 you'll recover from it i've made a lot of mistakes

 but it requires a lot of energy

 and sometimes it's just easier to just stop and give up

 so

 i think that if you're starting out in the world if

 you've been lucky to have a wonderful life and you had wonderful parents

 man

 you

 should go and give them a huge hug because

 they

 did use

 such

 a service

 that

 most folks don't do to most kids unfortunately

 and it's not the fault of these parents

 but it's just tough life is tough

 so give him a kiss

 and then figure out a way where you can just do work that validates

 you and where you feel like you're developing some kind of mastery

 who

 cares what anybody else thinks about it

 just

 do it because it feels good do it because you like to get good at something

 but if you're not one of those lucky people

 um you can believe in your friends or you can just believe in me

 i'm telling you preserve optionality

 how you do that is by regulating

 um your reactions to things

 and

 your reactions

 are going to be largely guided

 in moments where you think that you are not the same as everybody else and

 specifically that you are less than those people and you're not

 so just save

 this part of this podcast and just play it on a loop if you need to

 um but that is my biggest learning is i am equal

 i'm the same as all these other people and

 you can imagine what

 that means to me to go out in the world to see people and think okay

 i'm the same as this person i'm i'm as

 good as them

 and you could imagine what you're probably thinking of what i'm thinking is not that thing

 right you're probably thinking man this guy yeah this guy i'm so much better no

 i am fighting this thing

 all the time

 well i've also met a bunch of folks who

 i think is a counter reaction to that once they become successful they

 start developing a philosophy then they are better or even some people are better than others

 i understand you

 know there's lebron james versus other people and so on but

 i always really resisted that thought

 because i feel like it's a slightly better

 they have mastery in a thing that they fall in love with yeah

 i'm trying to develop mastery in a thing that i love

 you know i love the art i love investing it's like solving puzzles

 and i love that i love trying to develop mastery and poker i really love that

 um i'm

 learning

 how to be a parent to a teenager

 because i have finally have one

 it's all new stuff to me and i'm learning

 um

 that's what it's all about

 yeah so you don't want to think you're lesser than and

 you don't want to think you're better than because those both

 lead you astray i've never thought i was better than i

 manifested better than

 because i was trying to compensate for feeling less then

 my

 goal is just to feel like everybody else feels

 on the presumption

 that everybody had

 like a normal life

 given

 your nickname is the dictator do you trust yourself with power like

 if i if

 the world gave you absolute power for a month

 no

 no

 because i think that you know i'm still riddled with bias i

 i don't i don't deserve that position i don't and

 i would not want that weight on my shoulders

 i had a i had a spot naturally where it was a very

 important and big poker game

 and it was a spot where i was in the pot and

 it was a really large pot it was like a million dollar pot

 and

 i had to make a ruling and the ruling was in in my favor and okay

 i was just beside myself

 because

 i don't

 play i play for the challenge i like to get pushed

 to the limit of my capabilities

 i

 want to see

 can i think

 at the same level of these folks you

 know because these guys are all experts they're all pros

 and i get enormous joy from that challenge

 and i like to win but i like to win just a small amount

 you know what i mean and then i never wanted to win in that way

 but because it was you know my game i had to make this call

 on a million dollar pot and i wanted to just

 shoot myself i

 just was like this is gross and disgusting and and he was a complete gentleman

 which made it even worse

 so

 i do not want absolute

 power well those are the people you do want to have power is

 the ones that don't want it which

 is a a weird system to have because

 then you in that kind of system don't get the leaders

 that

 you should have because

 the ones that one power aren't the ones that should have power it's

 a weird weird system

 what

 do you think let

 me sneak

 this question in there what

 do you think is the meaning of life

 i don't well why are we here

 look up at the stars and think about like the big

 why question

 i think that it's a chance to just enjoy the ride

 i don't think it really like

 i don't believe in this idea of legacy that much i think it's a real trap

 so do you think you'll be forgotten by history i hope so i

 really really hope so because

 if you think about it there are two or three people that are remembered

 for positive things and

 everybody else it's all negative things and

 the the likelihood that you'll be remembered for a positive thing is

 harder and harder and harder and so the surface area of being remembered

 is

 negative and

 then the second what

 will it matter i'll be gone

 i really just want to like have fun do my thing learn

 get better

 but i want i want to reward myself

 by feeling like

 oh that was awesome like i've told this story many times and i

 have put again my

 own narrative fallacy on top of this but

 you know steve jobs's

 sister wrote this you know obit in the new york times when he died and

 she ends it by saying his last words were oh wow oh wow oh wow

 that seems like an awesome way to die

 you're surrounded by your friends and family not

 the fact that he died obviously but

 in a moment where what i read into it was your family was there

 maybe you thought about all the cool shit that you were able to do

 and then you know you just started the simulation all over again and

 so yeah just

 on the off chance that that's true i don't want to take this thing too seriously

 you know what i mean just enjoy it so you're not afraid of it the end

 good in tomorrow get in right now

 so

 every day you can go and you're happy you're happy with the things you've done yeah

 you know there there are obviously things i want to do that i haven't done

 um but there are no gaping things i've really really been in love

 total gift there have been moments where i've really really felt like everybody else

 there have been moments where i have deep deep deep joy

 and connection with my children

 there are moments where i've had incredible

 giggling fun with my friends

 there's moments where i've been able to enjoy really incredible experiences wine food all that stuff

 great i mean what more do you want like i i could keep asking for more

 i would just be a really crappy human being at some point

 you know what i mean it's enough yeah

 yeah it's enough it's

 enough this

 life this life is pretty beautiful if

 you allow yourself to see it yeah it's

 really great and it's better than it's ever been

 um for

 most of us actually yeah

 it's pretty nice you know and all of the like you know millennials

 and gen z's

 you're about to get a boatload of money from your parents

 and you better figure out

 how to be happy before you get that money yeah because otherwise you will be miserable

 get a lot of dairy queen

 no

 that would that only worked the first time it

 worked two times in grade five and grade six my god that next year flex

 i worked my ass off i'm like but

 i could never bring myself to ask her yeah

 and then she did it and i was like man she's

 this woman's miss bruni

 the

 room is a gem yeah

 but the third time it faded

 isn't that the sad thing in my life you

 know the finiteness of it the scarcity of it

 without that we perhaps wouldn't ice cream wouldn't be so damn delicious you're an incredible human

 um i definitely recommend that people listen to on all all

 platforms

 just we're very lucky to be able to get your wisdom i enjoy i agree with

 um i've

 talked a lot about you with the audrey capothy who's somebody i really respect and

 he just loves

 the shit out of you you know in in how much you

 how deeply you understand the world it's

 a huge honor he's an incredible human being so that's on a different yeah

 speaking

 of semicolons

 there's some human beings that understand everything at

 the very low level and at the very high level and those people are also

 um very

 rare so it's

 it's a huge honor and also a huge honor that you

 would be so kind to me just

 like in subtle ways offline

 that you would make me feel like i'm

 worthwhile

 well can i just say something as just a layman listener

 um what you do just so i could give you my version

 is that you take things

 and people so ideas and people

 that are mostly behind a rope

 and you demystify it

 and what that does for all of us is it makes me feel

 like

 i can be a part of that

 and

 that's a really inspiring

 thing because you're

 not giving advice you're not telling us how to solve the problem

 but you're allowing it to be understood in

 a way that's really

 accessible

 and

 then you're intellectually curious in ways that you

 know some of us would never expect

 that we were and then you kind of end up in this rabbit hole

 um and then you have the courage

 to go and talk to people that are really all over the map

 um like for example like i when i saw your

 jordan peterson example like you

 went there like you talked about nazism

 and i was just like man this is a complicated argument

 these guys are going to tackle and it's

 just it's really

 um really

 impressive

 so i have an enormous amount of respect for what you do i think it's very

 hard

 to do what you do so consistently

 um and so i i look at you as somebody i i respect because it's

 um it just shows like somebody who's immersed in something and who's

 very

 special so thank you for including

 me in this i'm

 going to play that clip to myself privately

 over and over just when i feel

 low

 and self-critical about myself thank you so much brother thank you incredible thanks man
