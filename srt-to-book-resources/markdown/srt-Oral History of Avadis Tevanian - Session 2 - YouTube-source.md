# Chapter 1

all right

uh

today is april 17th 2017

um

i am hansen

su

i'm john marov

david brock

ai tanan avan

great

so

um

this is the the

the apple chapter

if you will

and could

could we start

i'd like to start by asking what your role was in that transition period

are there things

that you remember about that really sort of jump out at you about the process of of going to

you know

next becoming part of apple

so you're talking about literally the transition right after the acquisition was done

well

even like the first things you remember about that process of the acquisition

and becoming part of becoming part of

okay

yeah

so i guess

maybe i'll start with

uh

um

the process to get acquired

um

which started

i think it was just before thanksgiving around that time frame of 1996

and

uh

we had been watching in the press

um

about how apple was talking to be about potentially buying the company to get their os

because they needed a new os at the time

and you know

to be honest at next

our focus was more against competition from companies like sun than from apple

more in the workstation space

and so we weren't really weren't really paying too much attention to apple

but we had

um

while we were still supporting next step

of course

an open step

we had become increasingly focused on web objects

and so apple was not at all in that space

but when

um

i remember

when i saw some of those articles

um

i talked to steve jobs and said you know if they're going to buy an os

i mean we've got the best one

it's pretty clear

and so he made some calls into gil gil amilio

and in parallel

some of our marketing folks were making calls into apple as well at various different levels

and very quickly we had meetings set up to do technical evaluation

technical diligence

things like that

and in basically under a month we had a signed deal to be acquired

um

right after being acquired right after signing the deal to be acquired

so now we're looking at

uh

late december

couple days before christmas

uh

96

uh

as that quarter is coming to a close for apple

they had to pre-announce a major loss

and that kind of took us by surprise

we certainly didn't see that coming just because we weren't watching the company at all

um

we knew the company was struggling

but we didn't know that it was that bad off

um

but the deal went through

um

we actually started doing a little bit of integration

uh

in january

very little

because you can't really do the integration until the deals closed

which was in february

i think

february 6th or 7th of 97

but i remember

um

you know

some of the initial interactions

uh

were

uh

helping gil to prepare a macor speech in early january

an ill-fated ma world speech went on for like three hours

the longest speech i've ever heard all of us

yeah

um

it was amazing to watch it

and i say that in a not good way for people just reading the transcript

were you in the audience

or were you back

i was in the audience

um

and our role

well

we had two roles

one

one role was ahead of time to help prepare gil

and his team for those parts of the keynote that would focus on the next acquisition

and that was only one small part of it

they had many many things to announce

yeah

um

and then our other role was

steve jobs did 10

15 minutes of his own

um

after gil talked about the the merger coming up

um

and and steve's part of course was very good

i think it's widely acknowledged that that was the case

um

so so that was one part of it

that was sort of the first thing

the real tangible thing that i remember

another tangible thing that i remember was

um

i started meeting with

uh

um

some folks who would either become my direct reports inside of apple

or were sort of key people at apple

that i would really need to get to know and and work with closely

if you will

beyond who are coming over from the next team

yeah

and you know that was a pretty eye-opening experience for me

because i got to see firsthand some of the things

that were causing apple to be in the state that it was in

yeah

so let me backwards and then go forwards

because talk a little bit about the management team at that juncture on the next side

um

were you part of a a small group of people who are making strategic decisions at next

yes

so you know that's an interesting question

um

in that i don't think a lot has really understood about what was going on

then

um

so i was part of the next executive team for many

many years

either informally or for normally

almost from when i started back in'88 um

but when we're looking in 96

um

you know the company had gone through some pretty big transitions

first

uh

getting out of the hardware business

huge transition and

then

uh

transitioning toward lot

similar

with the hardware business around that same time frame

running the software on multiple platforms

obviously there's no hardware

it's got to be software

but also then transitioning or adding

if you will the web objects business

which would have

i think

would have been very

very

huge at the time

um

and so we had a small management team

uh

i ran engineering

it was only software engineering

at the time

it was all of engineering

we had a cfo

we had someone running sales

i think we had someone running marketing

it was a somewhat traditional but small management team

but something interesting was going on

which was

as we transitioned out of hardware

and as we transition more toward selling a web solution on the server side

it was a more it was

it was an even more enterprise sale than it was before

and um

steve was getting fairly uninterested in that

and he was getting tired of it

and he had pixar going on on the side

and so what we were going to do

in fact

had we gone public and this is in the the draft

s1

we were going to form an office of the president

which would have been

um

me

i believe

uh

mitch mandich and who's our sales guy

and i believe dominique tro

who's our cfo

and and steve

i think we probably would have been part of that

he would have been ceo and chairman

but what we were really trying to do was also to take some of the load off him

so

and and frankly

you know

enterprise sales wasn't his expertise

so that was fine

and the rest of us we were all fully engaged and able to to take the business forward

so that's kind of what it looked like inside and then

was there a distinct board

and were there interesting board members that you remember

that were involved in that decision

that were separate from the management

so the office of the president

i mean the the office of the president decision

or the

the

i'm sorry

the merger decision

um

so i'm pretty sure ross was still on the board

um

i'm pretty sure canon had a representative

because

uh

they had done a $ 60 million loan

and if there was any other board members

i don't remember

obviously steve was a board member there may have been another

i don't remember

but it wasn't

it didn't show up as a separate decision making

pro

the

the key decisions were made at the management group level

the key decisions were made at the manag group

the management group level

the decision to sell was

you know

me and steve and a couple of others

and that was a no-brainer um

because we had a fair price

a good price

what i thought you know

similar to what

it would have been going public

with full liquidity at the time

and putting our our technology and people into a company that we thought could really magnify it

yeah

but this was taking

i mean

as i recall

i mean steve was coming back as kind of initially

he wasn't there as ceo

right it

it

it was

he was like a friend of the company

almost

so

now you're talking apple

so when we got to apple

we all got jobs at apple

but steve didn't and that was all by design

um

he didn't want one

and i mean what job is he going to have right

i mean

i guess they could have given him the ceo job

then he wouldn't have taken it

yeah

um

at least i don't think he would have

but that wasn't what the deal was and so

you know they knew apple knew that

um

and to gil's credit

gil knew that he needed steve to help

um

you know

gills criticized for a lot of things about what what he did with

rightly

so

but the one thing he got right was knowing that steve was going to be a positive um

and so steve basically signed on as an informal adviser

yeah

yeah

and do you remember

at steve's memorial

larry ellison told that what i thought was a really sweet story about them talking about how to

you know how to go back to apple and larry had a very sort of cutthroat

you know

steve could make billions of dollars of i don't quite remember the story

but it was larry wanted to make money

office

steve wanted to do it because it was the right thing to do

did

am i telling it right

no sort of

um

the the essence of the story and and the true source of course should be larry

yeah

but

uh

the essence of the story

which i've heard from larry at that point and and in other other cases is that

um

obviously larry wanted to make a lot of money turning apple

um

and he wanted to help his friend steve

and steve really wanted apple to be success

successful

because it was his baby

um

and so larry's sort of idea was he would fund the takeover and install steve as ceo

and then together they would make it successful again

and

and

steve

according to larry

steve didn't really want to do it in a hustle way

he didn't think that was going to work

he didn't think that was going to be good

and he was still dealing with next and dealing with pixar

so that was a non-star now

steve never mentioned that to me

so i don't know to what extent it's been embellished

or you know how it's changed as it's been repeated many times

yeah

did you go ahead

uh

i was interested in asking about the

the bake off that you had with be

talk a little bit about that

the bake

off

so there was a

there was allegedly a bake

off

i only saw one side of that or one part of that

um

but i've been told by people who were in the room that there was indeed a bake off

and so as we were

um

uh

nearing the end of 1996

we done a bunch of uh discussions with the company

and they decided they wanted to do a bake off

be versus next

um

so

uh

we both went in at separate times

stage

we wouldn't meet each other there to the garden court hotel in palo alto and um

i don't know if we went first or they went first

i'm not even sure

uh

they may have gone first

but i don't remember

um

so steve

and i had an hour hour and a half or so to present our case to the management team

and

and we had

we had the benefit of a product that was in the market that worked great

that had been around for many years and b didn't

and so i remember

steve did his uh general sort of sales pitch on the company

and and the product and and everything we've got invested in and everything they could do

and we did just an incredibly dazzling demo

i remember

we had um productivity apps

um

we had

uh games

we had um

quicktime movies

four of them

on the screen

3d models all going at the same time literally on the screen

this was back in 1996

you know today

that's nothing

but we're talking over 20 years ago

that was a huge deal and the management team

i mean these guys were apple

i mean why couldn't they do that themselves

yeah

is probably what they're asking themselves right

and

and so we just had this great presentation and demo that

uh

i mean again

i don't

i wasn't in the room when be presented

um

but i think

they thought that they just had the deal done and there was only so much they could show

anyway

their product wasn't nearly as mature

their technology wasn't nearly as good

and so

uh

that happened

uh

when

when

uh

we finished

um

steve and i left the garden court hotel and we went for one of our

uh

you know

signature

steve jobs walks around palo alto

and as we're walking around one of the blocks

um

we happened to see someone who was in

that meeting from the management team who said you guys won easily

no problem

you have nothing to worry about

so that's how that happened

was nagel in the meeting too

was he still around at that point

or was nel gone

he

i think he was there

i don't think he was there

interesting and that that must be significant if he wasn't there

because wasn't he head of software

maybe he was gone by that time

so when i was there

excuse me just prior

the last real head of software that i knew of was ike

nassie

oh

ike

yeah

and i think ike had just left

yeah

and so they may have replaced him

but i don't

if there was someone that was there

it was it

just there was really no one there

ellen hancock

the woman had come from ibm

did

did she show up on your radar at all

um

ellen was in this meeting

i remember

she was in the meeting

ellen was the deao person in charge of software

she was in charge of all of technology

i believe all of products

so she was that de facto person

yeah

at at that point

um

you were more than a colleague of steve

when you

you were

you guys were friends

i mean talk a little bit about your relationship with steve at that point

wasn't it closer than being a business only relationship

yes

so

in

uh

96

97

um

trying to turn back the clock in my head and get the dates right

so when i joined next in 88

we quickly became good friends we hang out together

# Chapter 2

so she was that de facto person

yeah

at at that point

um

you were more than a colleague of steve

when you

you were

you guys were friends

i mean talk a little bit about your relationship with steve at that point

wasn't it closer than being a business only relationship

yes

so

in

uh

96

97

um

trying to turn back the clock in my head and get the dates right

so when i joined next in 88

we quickly became good friends we hang out together

every once in a while

we go to dinner

a lot things like that

we

we were both of the the

we always like to work all the time

and so we could always we

we'd be outside of work

but we'd still be like talking about work and that was just great

and so

by the time this happened

um

he had married loren

i had married my wife

we both had kids

by then

from a friendship perspective

we started to drift apart a little bit because we were more with our families than with our friends

if you will

um

but we were still close

for sure

yeah

yeah

were you the best man at his

his wedding he had no best man

but i was at his wedding

okay

which was at um

in yuse

at valley

um

the

the wonderful lodge

the

yeah

that was a quite an event

yeah

yeah

um

so what can you say about

i mean

so what's always

you know

striking is sort of the outside image of steve jobs versus the the steve jobs i know through the people i know who work for him

okay

which is it

it doesn't connect often

i mean you know people on the outside sort of say he can be harsh and a tyrant

and you know all of that

and yet very few people left over a long period of time

i the people who walked away from steve jobs are on the

you know

they're just not

so there must be

there must be some disconnect

i mean

and i just wondered if i mean if you're aware of the sort of the of

that kind of outside versus inside image

yeah

and maybe if we just back up a second

you asked if i was the best man at his wedding

i wasn't

but maybe what you're thinking is i put together his bachelor party

that's what it was

which is normally something the best man would do

yeah

but you know someone had to do it

so i stepped up and did it anyway

so

um

you kind of asked a couple questions about him there

and i i think you know one thing i'll say is i i explicitly asked him one day

so what's it like being famous and you've got this persona of who you are

what people think you are versus who you really are

they're not necessarily the same

and his answer to me was very quick

and very straightforward and not like you had to think about it all

you kind of knew his answer well

that public

steve jobs is kind of like a brother

he's just some other person

he's not me

he looks like me

he sounds like me

but i'm a different person

my private person is a different person

it just a different person

so he kind of dealt with it that way

just

you know

that's the public view of who i am

and that's a role that i take on

it's like an actor

but a

but a brother

very

very close

yeah

and then

um

the other part of your question is

um

you know people

he was hard to work for

known to be hard to work for

yet people seem to stick around

um

yes

and no

um

he

certainly he was hard to work for much of the time

but he was also great to work for much of the time

um

if you

you needed to earn his respect

if you earn his respect in some form

and there are multiple ways to do that

in multiple forms it could take

then

um

he would generally be fair with you

he might be harsh

but he would generally be fair and because he had respect for you

um

you felt as though you could still work with them

even though you're getting criticized

and

and what usually it meant is

that you had thick enough skin that you were someone who could work for for him

and know that maybe he

if he's berating you today

he's not going to do that tomorrow because it'll change his mind

but the net of that was that people who couldn't do that

didn't last long

and so they would go away

but you'd kind of never really hear about it

just because it would just be one meeting and they're gone

okay

and and for them to even say they worked for him would almost be a lie

um

and and many people

the interesting

that i find is you find all these people who say they worked for him but never really did

they were like

maybe in a meeting with him one time

okay

and suddenly that's elevated to

i worked with steve jobs

and there are hundreds of if not thousands of people in the valley and beyond that

now say that which is

you know

yeah

if someone says they work for steve jobs

i like say

i don't even know that person is

they probably didn't okay

and that's usually the case

as opposed to the opposite where they really did work for him and work with him

um

on a substantial basis

people have told me that he would often reject ideas

but if you were forceful and stuck with your idea and didn't sort of back off

he would ultimately adopt things that would

would

you know

he would internalize them

they become his ideas at a certain point

absolutely true

and not

i mean not always

but

but it was possible

and the strategy was to get him to adopt your idea

yeah

right

because then he would go out and sell it and

um

you know

one day black could be the most important color in the world

and then the next year

and anyone who thought white was was an idiot

but then the next year it could be the opposite

white is it

and anyone who thinks black is

it is just wrong

okay

and it's not because the trend change

it's because they're just wrong

and

and so i don't want to say most of the time

but frequently he would push back on things just to see what was going to happen right

so if you're

if you present an idea to him and he says he doesn't like it

then what he's really saying is well

i don't really know if i like your idea or not defend it

okay

and if you could

then defend it

and it might take a while

okay

if you can defend it

then

uh

he'll go for it

and i have a great example of this

um

which i won't wait for you to ask about it

because it's a great example

and it's something that i didn't even remember or even realize

until he mentioned it in a press report many many years ago

so when we were doing the early version versions of mac os 10

one of the differences between mac os 10

and the prior mac os's 8 and n was that mac os 10 had inherently built into it

authentication

they were us quote users

right

whereas the mac

the old mac was just

it was your computer

right

there was no who you were or anything like that

you didn't log into it or anything

and as we were trying to figure out what mac os 10 should end up being

and reconciling it with the past

and not being too disruptive to users while adding in a lot of new technology

steve really kept pushing back on this notion that you had to log into your computer

he thought that was just wrong

you should never have to do that

it's your computer

it's on your desk

when you turn it on

it should be right there at your desktop and you're the owner

and so

if you

if you think about when we're having these discussions

this is 97

98

99

okay

very early on before people thought about security and computers very much

um

and we'd have this discussion once a week for many months

um

and he would keep complaining and i would keep saying

no

we need it

we need it

but you know

at the time

i could never really articulate a good reason why we had to have it

because no one was talking about security

we had it

because you know we had a unix heritage and unix unix systems had this

and

but deep in my bones

i felt it was the right thing to do

and at some point

uh

after many

many months of of arguing this

he said i

i said

steve

i can't give you a really good reason why we must keep this

other than i believe in my bones

we must have this

and he said

okay

just make it easy to use

okay

which we did

and now

when you you turn on

auto

login

your mac logs in

automatically

right

it just works

i mean your phones have the concept of users in them

but you never see it

yeah

okay

um

and so

as time goes on

we ship the product

few more years go on

what happens

windows starts getting targeted by viruses

for the simple reason that you can download and install software

by just accidentally clicking on a link and nothing ever pops up to stop it

whereas on the mac

when you downloaded and click the link

that was going to do something that required any kind of privilege at all

it prompted you for your username and password

and that was one of the reasons the mac was spared so many years from getting these

and he realized many years after this decision

that trusting my gut feel

and i i couldn't articulate that reason

then

because that wasn't an issue

right

but it turned out to be one of these really smart things that we did that he agreed with

because he had a certain amount of respect for me and because he knew that

if i felt really strongly about this

even in this case where i couldn't articulate the reason he had to go with it

interesting

that's

and so you know

that's just kind of how he operated

but you know you really had to keep pushing on him to to to do

that to get him to finally agree

that was not easy

yeah

so that culture that you guys came into

i mean it wasn't a gil

amelo was a a creature of the semiconductor industry

and he had sort of cobbled that on top of the apple culture

i remember

when i interviewed steve early on

he described the first time he saw gil's executive dining room at apple

and you know

he told me about the silver

and how shocked he was at the silver and how that had gone away

um

how hard

i mean

how

what were the cultural things like when you first came into the the

the

you know the into apple

there was definitely those things you talk about

um

you know

food was plated into a really fancy dish and and things like that

not that i mean that might happen if i were to go to a board meeting

and there was lunch being served

if i was just getting lunch on my own

i'd go to the cafeteria and get it

like most people there were

there was definitely some of those things

and to me

you know

my prior career had only been in a small company

startup

next right

or academic situation

where you don't get any of that stuff

and i just thought well

whatever

i mean

whatever

who cares

right

i mean i'm here to build products

right

and if they want their dinner or lunch served on a nice piece of china

great

who cares

right

it's a big company

we got lots of money

i guess in the scheme of things it

it doesn't matter

but

but

um

i don't know that that was really a cultural thing that hurt the company from a product perspective

um

i think

instead

um

the

i don't know if it's a cultural thing or a management issue

what what really hurt the company was

um

it had gotten very successful on a product that was paying all the bills and completely lost focus

um

and had a bunch of truly smart people who are off pursuing their own things without any cohesive strategy

and and no leadership

really figuring out

well

what do we do

what's important to do

and you know every decision could be second guess and cause massive debate and decisions would not be made

or even worse

you could have two really smart people completely working against each other

and that that's really what the problem was

and when you came in

i i'i've forgotten now were

were tagan and kida completely gone already by that time

or were there still sort of vestiges of that

did you have to

sort of

you know

carve that away

um

those were not things i had to carve away

they may have still been around in some minor form

but it was

they were not issues

they were not issues

all the issues that i had to deal with were

you know

90 plus per internal issues

yeah

building a a new software design culture at the company

is

i me

it was

um

the issues were at multiple levels

so there there was the sort of management of people level

and then there was the strategy level and the management of people level was one of

um

well

there's also operations

um

the management of people issue was

we had a lot of smart people who as i just mentioned

really weren't working on the same team

they were working for their own interests

and they all thought what they were doing was the right thing

um

and they needed someone to step in and say fundamentally

well

this is what we're doing

the decision's been made

either

you're you

i don't care if you agree or disagree with the decision

but this is what we're working on

and if you agree with it

great work on

if you don't agree with it

then just say you don't agree with it

but that you're going to support it and work on it or leave the company

and that process caused a lot of people to leave the company

because they could not get on board with the decisions that were being made

and they suddenly realized that their side projects or their efforts to derail

these decisions were not going to be successful

um

and so they left or they were fired

or whatever

some combination thereof was

apple labs still around

was that

one of the things that was

it was called

i believe apple research and we shut it down

not because we didn't like research

but because from an operational perspective

we had to have all hands on deck working on the products that we thought were important

yeah

and so we could no longer afford to fund it and we could no longer take the risk

if you will

that they'd be going off in directions that didn't match what the company was going to do

especially when they're spending money the fact was they were spending money

we needed to spend that money on the things that needed to get done

remember

we're losing a lot money at this point in time

we don't have a lot of luxuries to do things like basic research

i remember

you know

one of those technical debates was over the uh executable format for os10

there was this mao versus uh pf format

um

i remember being oddly honious

uh

at the time over something that seems kind of trivial or not so important in the long run

so i don't remember that specific technical back and forth

if you will to be generous

um

but there were many like that

and

um

generally

you know

i would like to believe that every decision we made was the right one

for the right reasons

so good technology

um

you know

the right technology

good fit with customers

um

# Chapter 3

um

i remember being oddly honious

uh

at the time over something that seems kind of trivial or not so important in the long run

so i don't remember that specific technical back and forth

if you will to be generous

um

but there were many like that

and

um

generally

you know

i would like to believe that every decision we made was the right one

for the right reasons

so good technology

um

you know

the right technology

good fit with customers

um

standards based

or if not

whatever

whatever is appropriate for for what it is

all those kinds of things

but

uh

we definitely had

um

a lot of passion inside the company for different things

and the hardest thing was there

there

there were many times where we picked the technologies that were

it was next versus apple

if you will

okay

and the next technology was picked instead of the apple technology

and it was usually because the next technology could be shown to be demonstrably

superior in a number of ways

but people didn't want to believe that was the reason

because they just thought the apple side was losing

that was not the case

and you know there were probably a couple cases where here here's the issue

a lot of times

when these decisions were made

it meant there would need to be some kind of transition with customers or developers

because the technology was changing

and that caused angst for people advocating keeping things the way that apple had done it before

and um

let me give a great example of this networking

the networking standard for apple at the time was apple talk and apple talk was just wonderful

networking for a land and there were ways to make it work beyond the land

but it was kind of tricky

it was designed for a land

and in a land it worked great

it was way better than tcpip

but the rest of the world has standardized on tcpip and uh

it was obvious to me

and some others who weren't totally immersed with the appleway for many years

that tcpip was going to win all the battles

it was already winning the battles

and at the time apple had an apple team working on apple talk and their ip stack was outsourced

and so i said this doesn't make any sense

networking is a key part of the product

and oh

by the way

there's a standard networking stack that's open source

that's been in use for many years

and even if the standard isn't fully implemented in certain implementations

this one we know is interoperable because it's the same one everybody else uses

so we're just going to use this now just happens to be

that's what next was already using

so people look at that as a next versus apple decision

when it is

we are going to standardize on the networking of the future using the most standard

and oh

by the way

free software

and we're going to integrate that in

well

i got no end of complaints about that

they got

in fact

people went around me all the way to steve saying we're going to tank the company if we do this

and including the people who are selling us the stack

the software stack from the outside

they were making money off app

and so i just sat down

and i laid it out and said this is the standard of the future

number one and number two

this is the standard imple implementation

number three

it's free and open source

people will keep working on it

this is no-brainer decision

end of discussion

but it took an effort to get there

and and so the good news of that was

once

you know

usually i could just make these decisions myself

if there was still unrest in the masses and in this case there was a little bit

then

once i got bought in

then it was end of discussion

and i could usually get him to buy in on that

but there's a flip side of this

which is that um engineers and again

good engineers would come to me and they would say you can't do this

our customers know and love apple talk

they just plug in a new computer and it just works

and that doesn't work with tcp

i

it works with apple talk and they plug in a printer

it just works

i said great

so your job is to now make tcpip do this

and now

lo and behold

here we are today

20 years later using tcpip

everybody just plugs in their computer or their printers and devices and everything

and it just works

and that's

because we got motivated to fix a few problems

and fill in a few gaps with dcpip that didn't allow to do that before

and so the other point i made to them was what you're what you're advocating is a solution

that is going to keep 3 % of the addressable market

happy

that was the existing customer base

maybe it's 5

%

you're going to keep 3 to 5 % of the custo

the potential customer base happy

i'm like

look

i want to keep those people happy

but i w have a way to go get the other 95 %

and we can't get the other 95 % with something like apple talk

they just never going to buy it

okay

and you know we never got the other 95

%

but you look today and apple's doing pretty well

even with computers

yeah

and you know

there were some people they just couldn't get their head around this way of thinking

and they they either quit or were fired

yeah

and then the people that could

they said you know what

there's a few things wrong with tcpip today

but we know how to fix that

and we can work with the itf and change the standards and evolve it

and you know

do a few things with dhcp

and other standards

and fill in here

and fill in there and make some dns changes and we can make this all work

it does

yeah

go ahead was that

so clearly

embracing open standards and even incorporating open source was a big change in apple strategy

um

what motivated that was that something because of your

you know

because of nex

nex was already doing that was that just sort of natural

um

yeah

embracing open standards

um

and

and

uh

we even published some of our lowlevel source code at the time

that was a huge change for apple

in the history of apple never been done

it was something that steve wasn't all that jazzed about

um

but the the basic argument there was

um

we've got certain layers of software that have in the real world now traditionally become open source

in the sort of important demographics of users

developers

for example

um

and there's not really any downside to open sourcing

some of these things

and in the case of of implementing standards is lots of upsides

there's no need to have a closed network when you can now interoperate with everyone else

especially when you're not the majority player

um

and so it was a big change

uh

and it was not

it wasn't a no-brainer decision

but it wasn't a hard decision to make either

and

and remember

we always had the flexibility to control where we interoperated and where we didn't interoperate

and what we open sourc

but we didn't open source

we could control all those things ourselves

this may not have been in your portfolio

but one thing i saw in those first years

um

from the outside

as a reporter

is that apple started as a more open company

i remember maybe twice

coming down and interviewing you

um

and after the first two or three years

i mean it was you and phil and johnny

and i can't remember one other person

we just sat down

steve wasn't there and i was there

as a new york times reporter

i did a profile of johnny

i very early

um

and then the company gradually became a company that spoke with one voice

and i was that a strategy you were aware of

or did i mean

what did it look like from your side

so i hadn't thought about that very much

that's an interesting point

you raise

what i would say

is that

um

right after the merger

closed

while gil was still ceo

um

it was typical for many

many people to talk publicly

in fact

i remember

uh

that summer i went to paris to keynote apple expo paris

um

i don't remember exactly why i did it

i think

maybe because gil had done so poorly in january

they wanted someone else to do it

they sent me and

and so that was not really an issue

apple had lots of people out there in the press

um

if i were to speculate now i would say that maybe you're talking about a time

where steve is not really the ceo

he's interim ceo

yeah

i'm not sure

probably in ceo

and so he really does need other people to step up and talk

and so that's going to be the people you just mentioned that i

and then when he comes in to be ceo

then the lockdown starts to happen

yeah

yeah

it wasan

it was

it was

i mean

i

i understood it

it wasn't

it

wasn't

you know

wasn't in my interest as a reporter

but i absolutely

i could see it working

um

right

from from steve's point of view

he was building

you know

a singular

uh

you know

he very clear

uh

picture of what apple was is

is what you got as a result

yes

um

um

so i'm interested in the in that still in the transition period

who were the sort of on the software side

the key players from next

and the

the people

the people who came in and took important roles

who who stands out in in your mind

so the key players from next

um

so at the time

um

it would have been brron stle

who is my right-hand man

basically brron brron basically took over what became mac os 10

uh

and turned that into the product

while i

i divided my time into some other areas like the classic mac os

quick time and other software projects

um

and so he was probably the key manager i had coming over from next

and then his key person would have been scott forall

and so you see that actual chain of who ended up taking over software over over the years

um

and and scott was sort of the right-hand man for a lot of what was the appkit

at the time

some of the built-in applications

things like that

they were sort of the key people that we brought over up front

initially

was there ever any question about as as the merger happened

about that role that you took as as senior vpf software

or was that part of the deal

did i mean

did that happen simultaneously

um

so the day the deal closed

i had a signed off for letter as senior vp of software engineering

so that part of it was

there's no question

um

what i think was more in question was

well

what are the actual responsibilities and how does this work in this huge organization

um

which we kind of worked out there was

you know

ellen hancock was still very much in the thought process of what strategy was and things like that

uh

still still held still

sort of had gil's ear on strategic decisions

um

which was causing a little bit of trouble to get things done

but we worked through that

yeah

and

um

what was it like to work for gil

you

you spent some time working for gil ailio

yeah

so working for gil

was interesting

i mean

i found him to be a very nice person

um

you know

i found him to really want to hear what i thought about everything

he was sort of a if you will

trying to be a sponge

trying to learn

cuz i was operating in areas he just didn't understand

he seemed somewhat frustrated that

um

everybody was always critical of everything he was doing rightly or wrongly

um

and so

and he gave me sort of free reign to do whatever i thought was right

um

he

he

really

you know it

when there were decisions where other people might be saying something that contradicted what i was saying

he would really listen to me and his gut was to go with me

and i think that was in part because he had just done the acquisition

he trusted me

but also because steve was telling him

trust

this guy

listen to what this guy's saying

what he says

makes a lot of sense

and so that was very helpful

so you know the negatives you hear about gil

i didn't directly experience myself

because i was doing my thing

that was independent

i didn't need his help to do what i wanted to do other

than to not get in my way

yeah

and what do you remember about the events that led to steve becoming io

okay

so the events to becoming io

let me see

if i remember the events correctly

okay

so we're

we closed the acquisition in february

um

gil is still ceo

steve is now adviser and um

steve is not happy with gil

clearly

um

he doesn't come out publicly and say that

but in the background you can tell that's the case

and the first thing that happens is shortly after the deal closes

probably in the march time frame

um

there is a sale of 1. 5 million shares of apple stock at 13 and a quarter

which is the lowest tick ever since

okay

that is the bottom price since 1996

this is pre-split like 28 times

yeah

equivalent of 50 cents a share

right

something

something like that

yeah

and no one knows who did it

okay

because these things aren't publicly disclosed

but i know

and the world knows that

as part of the acquisition

steve got 1. 5 million shares of stock and they restricted stock

but he'd asked for the restrictions to be taken off so they could be tradable

and most people thought that he was the one that did it

and i asked him point blank

was that your sale

and he wouldn't tell me

point blank

but he led me to believe that it was him

and so that was his public statement that he was not happy with gil in the company

because it was widely reported at the time or theorized it was probably him

yeah

probably remember that

yeah

um

and so you know

that was sort of steve's way of making sure that everybody knew that gil shouldn't be the ceo

and he did other things behind the scenes

and there was plenty of material for the board to come to the conclusion

that gil should not be ceo

um

so the board made that decision

i believe

um

in july

because i think fred anderson made the phone call to gil on the 4th of july saying

that he'd been fired

yeah

and funny aside

um

which i've heard from fred

so i believe it to be true

uh

is right after calling gil

he called hancock

who was also being fired to tell her she was being fired

and

um

# Chapter 4

and there was plenty of material for the board to come to the conclusion

that gil should not be ceo

um

so the board made that decision

i believe

um

in july

because i think fred anderson made the phone call to gil on the 4th of july saying

that he'd been fired

yeah

and funny aside

um

which i've heard from fred

so i believe it to be true

uh

is right after calling gil

he called hancock

who was also being fired to tell her she was being fired

and

um

she first said

he first said to ellen

i think

or something this

where

uh

gil is no longer ceo and she thought he he was calling her to make her ceo

but um

she was also being fired

so that was sort of

you know

that next step where fred takes over as acting ceo

um

the board had a confidence in him

and steve had confidence in him and steve was having enough conversations with the board

the board wanted steve to become to come in to be ceo

but he wouldn't do it

had pixar gone public at this point

where was i don't think i don't think pixar in public

was it until might have been 96 before that

yeah

or i don't remember it was around that time frame

it might have just g

head was pretty much in pixar at that point i remember

wasn't it

well

he never spent that much time at pixart overall

yeah

it was never more than a day a week

even when he was the busiest there

but i think he was sly thinking about it a lot u

but he was thinking about apple a lot too

trust me

he was thinking about apple a lot and he was working on these things behind the scenes

so it was

you know

at that time we have no ceo

ellen's gone

it's a lot easier for me and john rubenstein to kind of get down

what we think needs to be done

fred is going to let us do whatever we think is right

and steve is sort of there

kind of talking with us

making mak

sure things are kind of going

but he's not day-to-day but you know you can only go so long without a ceo

and finally the board somehow convinced him to become interim ceo

i don't know exactly what happened

but i think it's just this notion that

because he could be interim ceo it was kind of like a call option on the job

and so if if he saw the path to success

he would take the job if he worked on it for a few months

and said this is just not going to work

then he didn't have to get himself into it

fail at it

yeah

yeah

but i mean he dug right in and you know

he started making some big decisions that we were all supportive of

and you know

used his name essentially to to get behind what was going to go on things that were very unpopular

yeah

like what kinds of decisions

oh

um

like cancelling the um

the sabatical program right after a certain number

of years

everyone was entitled to a six

we sabatical

um

and remember there was this email that he forwarded to all of us

he'received no

there's an email that went around to the whole

he had sent an email to the whole company saying

uh

outlining a few things that were going to change

that was the sabatical

was one of them

and there were four or five other things

and then someone had forged another email and sent it to the whole company

that was sort of a parody of this saying

and you must now work 24 by7

or it was just it was

it was just horrible

it was horrible

was that that was

remember the park park

different controversy

yeah

was that around

well

that was sort of an ongoing joke

right

there's not one controversy

ongoing joke joke

okay

yeah

and there are plenty of pictures to document that

um

there are many stories of steve jobs in vehicular [laughter] violations

i

at what point

at what juncture did the microsoft investment happen

that was

that was

um

that was that summer

yeah

it was

that was

um

that was

it was just before ma world boston

whenever that was

the deal was done the night before

literally

um

because it was

it was announced the next day

remember with the uh

the

the video of bill gates and the front page

picture

in the new york times

with a little sten exact

the big brother bill

big brother

bill

that's right

so there's no time to rehearse to make sure it's going to look right

it

just that's the way it was

yeah

um

so that was probably might have even been that july that year

i think it was yeah

and were you in involved in that discussion

yes

i was

cuz

you know

we had

we had discussions related to

um

it was

it was a big deal

it was microsoft was investing

um

patent cross license happened

yeah

um

and

uh

we agreed to

um

we agreed to make ie the default browser on the mac

that's right

yeah

those were the sort of three big things

yeah

which later turned into an antitrust l

yeah

did you get

did you

did

you

did you get

did you have to test

you did have

yeah

that's right

yeah

yeah

as a second witness for the government

that's right

that's right

okay

um

let's oh so

and um

had you worked with

what was sort of

what was your working relationship with john rubenstein like

and when did you guys first start

so john and i started working together at

next

would have been when he joined next

i don't remember when it was

it

probably 90ish 91

is

uh

and john stayed there until we got out of the hard hardware business

went off and did firepower and then

um

in that period of time between signing the deal for the acquisition in december and it closing in february

we called up john and we had lunch with him in redwood city

we said john

we want you to come join us

obi's going to run software and and you run hardware

and he agreed to do it

and

uh

so we were sort of the hardware software team

um

and we worked together all the way through

we both resigned on

i think he resigned

his last day was like march 31st of 2006

mine was april 1st of 2006

we

didn't work closely enough to get him exactly the same day

um

but

um

so we worked together very closely for all those years

and you know

john and i had a wonderful yet strenuous

relationship

um

because we had to work together yet we often had competing goals

and so

you know

while he

his goal was to get a new hardware product out every 9 to 12 months

whatever the cycle was and have the software for it

my goal was to not worry about the hardware

schedu

just get the features right for the next release

and so we are always locking heads

um

we'd fight a lot about things and priorities and who's working on what

and

um

but we always figured it out

and you know we didn't miss our dates in any way that anyone knew

at least

um

and you know

we ship by working together

our teams ship great products

so so we always knew we had that common goal of our teams working together to ship great products

but behind the scenes

we had to fight a lot and you know

kind of keep our teams working together

yeah

when was it that you knew that

do you roughly remember

remember when you knew the turnaround had worked

was it around

was it around the pillow

imac

or was it around

hardware

was it around software

what

what was the sort of sense you know we've really was steve's return

what

what

when

do i

when

did i know the turnaround worked

i don't think i ever knew that

i mean

um

look

it was obvious

once the iphone started going off the the charts

okay

but even developing the iphone

it wasn't clear that the turn run had sort of worked

i mean we were obviously making money and being successful

and you know

we've

we've been selling

we've been selling a lot of ipods

and we've been selling more macs but still small in the grand scheme of things

right

and

um

the business is a tough business

it's a hit based business

right

and so you got to keep the hits coming

y

and it's a competitive business and you

you know

i guess maybe we felt things probably didn't feel as dire

once we were getting some traction with the imac

and once we had mac os 10 out there and customers really starting to use it

those were probably two two

you know

hardware and software events that really told us we didn't have to worry about

there's no existential problem

okay

um

but frankly we were still described in the press as the beleaguered copertino company

right

so i guess the interesting question would be to go back

and pull out all the press articles and find out

when bleer was taken off the name

right

yeah

yeah

i never fell into that camp

i remember

walt moser killed you off

remember the obituary on the front cover of the did walt do that

i don't remember

walt wrote an obituary for apple

well

it was the merc that was always the worst

yeah

there was

so i'll take your word that there was the walt one

i'm going to go look that up when i'm done here

there was obviously michael dell saying

just give the money back to the shareholders right

these are obviously low points

and um

so you know

i mean when [music] um

when 911 happened

we took a big hit

as did most of the economy

yeah

the valley

the valley

the whole valley did

and

and you know we were somewhat tenuous

anyway

we weren't the strongest company in the valley

and so at that point it's like whoa

what's going on here

yeah

right

and

and we felt pretty good

i remember

we did a small buyback at the time

um

just

you know

to show confidence and almost out of patriotism

um

but you know

we were shaken a little bit by what happened after that

you know

there was a time when the the cube came out

which was not a hit at all

and you kind of wonder

yeah

so it was

it was

there was never one point in time

even with the ipod

i mean the ipod start out relatively slow and it built up time

and you know

it did okay

and then had a big bump up when we released the windows version

and you know

brought more people into look at and stuff

but these were all slow things

yeah

so there was a moment where probably where i gained my most greatest respect for steve as a strategist

and it was

it was an interesting sense

um

he telegraphed to me this switch to intel a year before it happened

as like this chess match in the in the computer industry and i didn't get it

until you guys made the switch and it was about

you know

video games

going to the power pc architecture and p p going to the intel architecture

and he

we had a conversation like a year before

where that was all in his head

he knew he was going there

and he said something to me when i looked back

he had sort of told me it was going to happen

and do you remember the strategy component of that

well

so him telling you a year in advance is only a surprise in

that you're a member of the press

and he would tell you something that's coming

but he did he didn't really

it was looking backwards

i didn't get

he didn't actually tell me he said something in retrospect

remembered that it was obvious to him a year before that it was going in that direction

that's because we already had it working

yeah

so one of the things about being in tech right is when a product is announced

it was already working well before that

and so the people who were already working on it knew that it's coming now

he may not have known the exact date

but as far as i was concerned

we were working on that product the day i started at apple in 97

and and we had software running on all the macs throughout all those years years

yeah

um

and was that about options at that point to give you flexibility

or what i mean in terms of that strategic relationship and all of that

you know

ibm ultimately couldn't deliver the

was it 10 gigahertz processor that they promised

yeah

i don't remember which processor it was

but

um

for me

um

having our software running on an intel processor at some point in time was inevitable

and so it always was about options and how we would execute those options

and so i didn't know if

like

at next

we got out of hardware business

apple would have to get out of hardware business as a really radical change

right

in which case

we'd have software to oem to different people

or we'd be in the hardware business

maybe building premium computers

which apple's always been great at with someone else just doing a super lowcost computer right

which would probably be based on an intel processor

there are a whole number of or or what eventually happened

which is just to switch the heart of the mac to an intel processor

when the other vendors couldn't compete

um

on whatever access mattered

and so

um

to me it was inevitable

and so i viewed my job as running software to make

i knew that at some point in time steve was going to say i need this product

okay

and i knew

starting from scratch

it was a 3 to five year effort because of everything involved

okay to port an entire os and do emulation and everything else

and so i knew i had to have it ready so that

when it was time to pull the trigger

we could get it out in 9 to 12 months

okay

which is what we ended up doing

yeah

yeah

that's remarkable

the

the

uh

the end of newton and then the roots of what became the iphone

um

what

what did it look like from the inside

okay

so the end of newon

that was one of those um

straightforward decisions

where only a handful of people second guessed it

people in the newton division

you know

interesting technology

no market traction

after a long time spending a lot of money on it

we got to focus

okay

wasn't clear where the volumes were going to be here

so that was relatively straightforward

relatively easy

although it it did take a while to get that to happen

and that was in part because newton was off in a separate division

neither john nor i own that

if either one of us had owned that

it would have been gone instantly

um

but it was kind of off on some side with other management

they were just kind of keeping it alive

um

longer to kill off

like printers

and other things that were just hanging on that needed to be killed off at the time the iphone

um

was interesting in that

um

i remember

the first time i thought we would seriously think of doing an iphone someday was

when we introduced a feature in mac os 10 called um

i think it was the dashboard feature

that is the feature

where you press one of the keys on the keyboard

and and it brings up a bunch of widgets on your screen

remember

yeah

so there's a

there was a weather widget

a stock widget and you could add other widgets

there's all kinds of a little calculator widget quickly

bring them up use them

throw them away and i remember

i looked at that and i said to myself and i

the team were

the first time our ui team showed this to us

i remember saying saying

oh my god

someday we're going to build a phone and that's going to be the user interface

it's going to be these little widgets

and oh

by the way you take out your iphone today

# Chapter 5

that is the feature

where you press one of the keys on the keyboard

and and it brings up a bunch of widgets on your screen

remember

yeah

so there's a

there was a weather widget

a stock widget and you could add other widgets

there's all kinds of a little calculator widget quickly

bring them up use them

throw them away and i remember

i looked at that and i said to myself and i

the team were

the first time our ui team showed this to us

i remember saying saying

oh my god

someday we're going to build a phone and that's going to be the user interface

it's going to be these little widgets

and oh

by the way you take out your iphone today

and it still has that very same stock widget and very same weather widget written the exact same way

using little javascript stuff

and so that was

probably

um

got

got to be early 2000s

yeah

and along with that

and i forget the ordering of these things

we had done some experiments with tablets using multi my touch

and so

um

our lead guy doing a lot of our user interface stuff had built this prototype

um

where

using multi-touch um

you could with multiple fingers drag a map and zoom in and spin it around

and all this kind of stuff

and we thought that was totally cool

and so the hardware guys built some prototype tablets

a few dozen of them

maybe

um

that did a few of these things and i had one in my office and i'm sure john did

and steve

we all used them

um

but this was just when we were getting wi-fi out there

so it must have been early 2000s

when the ibook came out with wi-fi

i don't think we had wi-fi in this

um

it it might have

but i don't

it probably did have wi-fi

but that was it

so this product was only useful in a couple places

where you could get wi-fi you couldn't get wi-fi very many places right

wi-fi was still unusual

no one had it at home and there was no data

ms that were useful

so we thought

hey

this tablet's kind of interesting in

except that it's not useful

and this was back when other people were trying to ship tablets and finding there's no market for it

for the reasons

i just describ

there's no connectivity to anything

so we shelv all that

so we sheld that and we we kept going on the widget stuff

we kept improving that

and then at some point it just started to make sense

that you could in the form factor of a phone have enough processing power in a multi-touch display

and add the software to it and have it actually work

yeah

now

when we started working on this

i don't know

2004

2005

whatever it was somewhere in there

no one really knew it was going to go

yeah

it was just was another ipod

like project we're going to try it

we're going to see what happens

yeah

were you around for the debate about about

you know

at that point the

uh

the blackberry had

um

rim had

sort of

you know that was becoming

i think it was

it was out there in the world

uh

this notion of this chicklet keyboard

um

i heard that there was an internal debate about whether you would have a virtual keyboard

or whether you would actually have a a physical

as a matter of fact

i heard that phil schiller was on the wrong side of that debate

that that he was committed to to keeping a keyboard in the were you in those debates

so there was not much of a debate

i mean there's always debate about everything

and let's just say the extent to which there was such a debate

it didn't matter

because the decision had been made

there was going to be no keyboard

and so you can keep talking about it

you bw in the face

and i don't know if phil did or didn't

i don't

i honestly don't remember

but you know

the advantages of no keyboard and a complete display were obvious and it was one of those steve jobs

you know

there's going to be no rescue boats

we're going to

this

is it

you're

g to

we're going to

you know everything's going to be bet on this

it's make or break it

it's either going to work or not

because when you put the keyboard on

you're going to make decisions that are not good decisions

okay

it's like going back to the tcp typ thing

well

this is what we're going to do

make it work really well

okay

and if if it doesn't work really well

well

you screwed up

yeah

and so there was no

there was no serious decision to be made

the decision been made

yeah

what was your role

um

during that whole period

um

so by the time the serious work got going on the iphone

i was mostly on the way out

so my role was mostly

i would say

almost

i don't remember

my role was heavily to make sure the soft strategy was right

and

um

we had

um

that that was a project scott forstall took on himself to pretty much own

and from the software perspective to make happen

um

and my goal was just to make sure the software was going in the right direction

and then let scott and the team deal with it all

yeah

and then the

the kind of the

what's the right way to describe it

um

was there always tension between tony fidel and scott forall

was that an always a contentious relation relationship

um

gee

i don't know if i should answer that question

it's okay

um

yeah

i probably

i mean

tony and scott are both great guys who have it's

it's like me and john

we would argue a lot

but at the end of the day we'd come to terms to make the right decision to get things done

yeah

and let's just leave it at that

yeah

um

we didn't ask about

so the raps city to mac os

uh

transition

could you talk a little bit about that

um

how did it evolve over time

yeah

so

i mean you know

the rap city to mac os transition was larg

a marketing thing

right

i mean that's about

we can go from mac os8

um

which was just coming out when we all joined apple to mac os 9 and then mac os 10

it

it was a great marketing story

we're just completely upgrading all the technology in a way that is as seamless as possible to users

there are multiple layers of compati ab ility

built into it

and so

instead of just you know

telling customers something completely different

it's just transition

like with the hardware

one day a mac had a power pc the next day it had an intel right

but it was still a mac

yeah

i remember the

the key difference from the way that rap cid had been pitched initially to um

to the rebranding as os 10 was the availability of carbon

and initially he had tried to sell rap city at being completely based on the next apis

or the yellow box

as you'd called it

um

and it seemed like there was a lot of developer push back

and then carbon carbon was announced the the next year

what was the process like of getting of

you know of getting carbon up and how critical was carbon to the success of os 10

yes

so the issue was to release a new os

you have to have a way for developers to bring their apps forward

and we had what was called the blue box

which could run a traditional mac os app

just in an emulation mode

if you will

but that really wasn't good enough to letting mac apps take full advantage of the new os

and when we talked to a lot of the big ones

adobe

microsoft

and others

it was clear they had good reasons why they couldn't just switch over to the new apis

it was a lot of work

and so with them we basically agreed to build an emulation layer called carbon

which was a large part of the mac toolbox um

running on quote on quote

rap city

if you will

giving them the way to link against the new api to get most the advantages of the new os

now we were able to pull this off in part because little known secret is

if you go back in time and think about quicktime

quicktime was a mac application which also ran on windows

and the way they ran it on windows was

by porting a reasonably large portion of with the mac toolkit over to windows

so they had made a reasonably large portion of it portable

um

and so we started with some of that

and added a lot to it to really make it more complete

and came up with a whole carbon layer as

well

i had forgotten this but there was this um idea of um

open step

yellow box for windows

but that never really what be

what became of that

do you remember

yeah

so that would have been continuing the open step for windows product that next had

and never became that important

never became strategic to the company

yeah

so it wasn't pursuit

and

um

the turning going from mock to darwin

how how challenging was that

well

mock to darwin is no change

say

darwin

darwin is the mock kernel that we used open

sourced

okay

so you know

we obviously

over the years made many

many changes to it and add the unix

later

the free bsd unix later into that

that's what darwin

was

yeah

was it difficult to to to act to open source

it

um

i assume you mean from a sort of philosophy or philosophical perspective

it

it wasn't that hard because large parts of it

you know

both mock and unix came from open source environments to start with

so it's very natural to do that

yeah

and um

i i remember

you know

when os 10 shipped

um

carbon and cocoa were

uh

the message was that these were both both peer frameworks

they were both considered native and they would for the foreseeable future

both be going forward

um

obviously

in the long run

that wasn't going to be the case

um

but at that point in time like

where did you see the sort of arc for how long carbon would be continuing to be supported

um

everything you said is completely correct

carbon and coco were both peers

if you will

um

there was

at least in the early days

there was no plan to sunset carbon anytime soon

um

and yet we wanted to make sure that people transition

so you didn't really see new features coming out on carbon whereas you did on coco

and

uh

you saw efforts to get

we kept pushing developers on the coco

because there were many advantages to doing that

and

um

it

you know

i

i don't know if there was even a specific actual phase out date for carbon

to be honest

i

i don't

i don't remember when

maybe maybe there was

but it's not like we're actively trying to get rid of it right

i think it was when

um

when os 10 went full 64bit

and the coco went 64 bit and carbon wasn't and there was a big brew haa over that

that that's possible

yeah

it's possible

okay

um

from your perspective

what was coco's big advantage over carbon

why was it the the way to go

well

i mean that's a

that's a complex complex question

well

that's a question with a complex answer

and maybe the most succinct answer is just to say

when you wrote an app in coco

you were almost always guaranteed to have all your features work correctly

and consistently with the rest of the system with carbon

you weren't

because with coco

you would do a very high level call and everything would just work

you would get a complete text editor without writing any code

and that text

eder head the same feature in every single app with carbon

all those things have to be built from scratch

they're always all different

yeah

so it really contributed to consistency

yeah

i remember

at some point i don't remember what year

bud tribble

coming to berkeley

we were both speaking

he gave a talk

and i remember i was just so stunned that he at one point said you know

something like

50 % of the lines of code in macos are actually open source

he was talking about the bsd component

i'm 50

%

is what sticks in my mind

but it was

it was such a

you know

since

to the outside world

who knew you know it was

it was

it was hidden

um

but it was all there

and i was just wondering

i guess the

the question is

um

the

the attitude that apple had toward open source when you were when you were running the show

what the attitude was definitely mixed

um

you know

the company's history had always been to be closed

uh

with some good reasons

and so you know

we just

we just became pragmatic about it

and in those areas

where it made sense to be open source and you could clearly see benefits with minimal risks

we would do it

um

and other

would

wouldn't even talk about it

why bother talking about it just wasn't worth it

may i ask a question

yeah

um

i would

i would be interested to hear you describe those

let's just say

the first five years that you were at apple

what is a day like for you

you know

um

you're

you're tackling some really big engineering projects

um

and i'm just interested to hear you describe

like how you the role you played in making them happen

you know

were you in meetings all day

were you walking around

um

if you could give us some of of what it was like to be there and and doing that

it seems like most of my days would either be

um

i've got

we didn't have our online calendars

so i had

i'd have my note card with my list of meetings for the day

and they'd be all backed up to five

just because there was so many meetings you had to do

or i'd be traveling somewhere for customer visit or conference or who knows what

um

so

and in

you know

then

in the evenings there'd be dinner and then emails after dinner

whatever

so it was just

it was a very busy time now that having been said

um

i would have to say that the time was spent in really useful ways

making important decisions

whether it's in an executive team meeting

we're deciding on the strategy of the company or reviewing user interface

which could be a three to four hour meeting

that's just all back and forth

it's

i mean you barely think of it as a meeting

you're just meeting with your colleagues reviewing their work

giving them feedback stuff like that

really high impact kind of interactions

um

and it would be

you know

there was obviously the management

the direct management part of it

you know

meeting your all your reports

one-on ones and figuring out status and challenging them to do really well

all those things

um

but i think if you step up a level

it was sort of this combination of this man

we're in this position where we can do something really important

okay

we can really change what people do in their

what

people

having their deadly lives through technology

and yet this difficulty of making it work

you know again

the baguer company in copertina

right about to go out of business

yet

that's what the outside

inside

it's like working on this really cool stuff

that's better than anything else out there and it's going to make so many people so happy

right

and so there were these two competing things and it was a almost like a daily grind

where you'd have

oh my god

this is so great

this is going to be so cool

when people get to use it versus we're about to go out of business

and this was a daily occurrence for all those years

yeah

um

go ahead

yeah

uh

i guess you know related to this

# Chapter 6

right about to go out of business

yet

that's what the outside

inside

it's like working on this really cool stuff

that's better than anything else out there and it's going to make so many people so happy

right

and so there were these two competing things and it was a almost like a daily grind

where you'd have

oh my god

this is so great

this is going to be so cool

when people get to use it versus we're about to go out of business

and this was a daily occurrence for all those years

yeah

um

go ahead

yeah

uh

i guess you know related to this

um

you know

during those first couple of years

uh

you know you were still having to make sure that the classic macos os8 and os9

um

there was still work going on

then to keep that going

at what point

um

did you decide

okay

we can stop working on os9 and put all our eggs behind

uh

os 10

um

the strategy with os8 and then os9 was to incrementally improve it as long as we needed to

which meant until we could get sufficient traction with mac os 10 that we didn't need it anymore

and we didn't know how long that was going to take

so we had a whole team devoted just to doing that

and what happened was

um

just something very natural where

when i first got there

got there

we staffed that team up very heavily

a lot of people working on that it was was paying the bills and as the years went on

we would just gradually transition people off that team onto the os10 team

and i don't remember when we turned the lights off on mac os 9

to be honest

i can't remember when the last release was

in fact

it may have been because we switched to intel processors

to be honest

obviously it wasn't going to run on intel processors

um

but there may have been maintenance releases on most maxs right up until then

um

just because we could

but we we had a team dedicated to making that that work

and we

we

that team knew that over time they could transition onto the os10 team in a meaningful way

yeah

what was refreshed me on the arc of web objects

and and you know

did

did web

did web objects come over for a while or did it go immediately

yeah

great web objects became an apple product and apple sold it for a while

um

web objects was used internally

quite a bit at apple to build some of the internal it systems

i believe it was used for the first online store

um

i rically have been used for dell's online store

um

but over time it just out of neglect

probably it never really went anywhere and just died

a slow death

cor strategy was elsewhere

yeah

exactly

even though there had been so much potential

if that had been next direction

you said

yeah

you know

it's one of those things that really required a startup like company to keep investing in

and have it be super important

it was never going to be material to apple

yeah

so it just died off when you got into the

you know you've been at a small company all of a sudden were at apple

what did the competitive land landscape look like

i guess

either through your eyes or steve's eyes

in terms of

you know who the competitors were that mattered

you know

all it had been sun to certain extent

maybe ibm

those guys

all of a sudden you were in a consumer world

and who were the the people you cared about in in a way

while things changed

it didn't change

now

clearly

microsoft was more of the direct competitor

but you know we had spent a long time building a consumer os

and that's what we were still now doing

and so that wasn't that big of a change

arguably

the bigger change was operating on a different scale

cuz

the numbers were all much bigger

um

and ironically

i was warned that i would never succeed

because the scale of apple was much bigger than next and it wouldn't wouldn't be able to work whatever

um

but you know

software is one of those things that scales pretty pretty easily and pretty well

um

so that proved to not be too much of a problem

especially when you've got a good team working on things

yeah

what were the internal dynamics

um

that led you to

did apple have to let you testify at the antitrust trial

was that a discussion inside apple

or was that a personal decision of yours

um

the way that came to be

was

um

i think it was netscape that had taken the lead with the government on driving that lawsuit

and

uh

so the government was looking to build its case

so looking for other people to testify on their behalf

and obviously apple made total sense

right

having been in the crosshairs with microsoft for so many years

the the deal to bundle ie was an interesting part of that

um

and so i

what i believe happened at the time was they were trying to get steve jobs to testify

i see

and he said no way that's not going to happen and he volunteered [laughter] me

makes it very simple

so i had to do it

did

did ever cross paths with um

i think he was sort of your equivalent

a little bit

no

it was maybe one step below steve mcy at intel who also test

he was the one who

oh

yeah

what was his

i mean he gave the quote to me and i'm forgetting what his quote was

um

it was about burying

um

oh

we'll cut off the oxygen supply

that was right

i don't think i ever talked to him

and they were pretty good about not wanting witnesses to talk to each other

yeah

yeah

okay

um

the actual event and going to washington and stuff

do you remember anything about it in particular

was it was it fun

was it like terrible

uh

it was an incredible experience

um

the

i mean i

i

i think just testifying in any court case is probably pretty unusual but in this case it was like over the toop unusual

and i remember

um

so once it was decided that i would be the person to testify

we hired someone to represent me

um

and so he starts doing his work and so he he meets with me and he says

so

a

i want to tell you they put my name in as a witness

and so immediately microsoft starts sending subpoenas

and he said i want to tell you that microsoft has subpoenaed all your personnal records and i'm like

okay

why would they do that

he's like

well

they're going to look for something to use against you

he's like i've got your personnel records here and he added a folder

which was basically empty

he's like

why is your folder empty

and all that was

there was like a review in there from bud from like 1989

maybe 1990

a couple couple of pieces of paper like that

i'm like

well

i don't know

that's my hr file

i don't anything about it

i've never seen it

but yeah

i don't normally get reviews and whatever

so apparently this was a good thing

but that was the reality

and how difficult was the cross

do you remember anything about the cross

um

well

the

yeah

the

my part of the my part of testifying was actually

it turned out to be relatively straightforward

um

and it's because we literally spent months in preparation

so i almost had to like

stop doing my job for a while and work with the lawyers for months

yeah

on documents that are being produced

and what does this mean

what does this mean they're going to use this

they're going to use this

and it was

i mean room fulls of documents to go over

and

um

um

so you know

during my no

during the cross examination

very early on

something interesting happened where the person that was questioning me asked me a question very early on

and i gave a fairly long-winded answer

that was not good for microsoft

it was not good at all

it was

you know

i clear

provided more information on this guy wanted

that was not good and he immediately said to said to the judge

your honor

may i request that the witness keep his answers to the question

and the judge immediately said

i think that's exactly what he did

so at that point i felt as though i had kind of went over the judge and uh

he started asking me questions directly

which was virtually unheard of

where

remember

remember

one of the big issues was

um

the bundling of the browser into the os

the embedding of it

which today nobody does right

and microsoft was arguing that it was absolutely required

so the judge turned to me at some point

and asked me my opinions for if he thought it needed to be embedded

and we're

we're just having this dialogue

and the guy cross-examining me is like twiddling his thumbs wondering what's going on here

so that part went okay

but still it was extremely stressful

you know it was one of those things where you walk to the front of the courthouse

the federal courthouse in washington dc

you know the capital is up on the side on one way

what the white house is on the other side and you see these

um

you know big scaffoldings with cameras

and news crews and cnn and cnbc and and all that kind of stuff

and and then so i'i'fly there

i'd fly home for the weekend

oh yeah

we watched you on tv all weekend or all all during the week

cu

like every 10 minutes

it's the news thing

yeah

so it was

it was kind of incredible

it's amazing

tell us about the transition to becoming

um

oh

sorry

um

i was wondering how impactful do you think your testimony was in that case

you know

there's there's no way to know

but given that the judge found for the government

right so the government want its case

and given the way he personally interrogated me

and given what i could say

well

you can have a browser in with the os

but you don't have to have it built in the way they've done it

i think that was

i'm told

that was pretty damaging to their case

but who knows

for sure

i mean there were many

many other witnesses

many

many other considerations

yeah

yeah

i wanted to ask about the transition to becoming chief software technology officer

and what what that meant

and what did it signify um

so that was the result of

so

i think we're

we're talking around 2004 now

and so so i had been in charge directly of software for seven years

and i'd been in charge of software and effectively leading software

for a long time

at next

nine years

at next

right

so that's about 16 years in the trenches

on the line

delivering products

you know

under the microscope of steve jobs

and so somehow we got into discussion and it's like

you know

i've had enough of this

and let's find another way for me to keep doing kind of what i do

and so we came up with this chief software technology office officer job

um

which we both thought was a great

it was as simple as that

it was like you know i've been doing this a long time

but i don't want to leave the company

he doesn't want me to leave the company

um

and you know

let's give brron a shot to run this

um

and that's simply how it happened

and and response to david's question about what you did during your day

i wanted to ask two sort of follow on one is

did you ever find time to manage by walking around

were you

were you a manage by walking around

kind of person

or was that valuable to just wander out amongst the programmers

you know

i want to say yes

because or walking around with the programmers yes is

i want to say that

yes

because it sounds like the right thing to do

but programmers

they're in their office with the door closed

focused on their screen

okay

they don't want you knock it on their office unless you've got a good reason to

so what i would do instead was have a strong presence

either with a communication meeting

talking with everyone

filled in questions or in review meetings where there were lots of people

20

30

even 40 people reviewing a product being part of that process

asking questions using all the products

filing bugs for specific engineers

against certain parts of the project

doing all those kinds of things

which is a form

i guess

of walking around but not literally walking around

so i was very much in the stream of consciousness of lots of people

but in a way that's a little bit perhaps unusual or non-standard and then

you know

the kind of day you described

where you're basically interacting and responding all day long and even into the evening

when you became

um

the

the software technology offer did

did you actually get the time to think more than the next product release

i mean i

and what's that

like

i mean to to actually think more than one generation into the future

yeah

so that was a total change

the days were not booked

al all day solid

i didn't have any direct reports anymore to deal with

and brron dealt with all that

and i could just kind of go around and literally poke on things

and you know i'd hang around with steve and see what products he's looking out

review things

which was sometimes good

sometimes bad

um

and

and you know

i

i did think more strategically

i let me step back

and do things like talk to people about what the software strategy for iphone should be

how we can do that

cuz we had options there and and a lot of other things like that

you know

be more perspective about the intel switch

things like that

yeah

yeah

um

this is

this is um hansen's question

because i don't know enough about it

it says

he says

how difficult was it to convince steve that the itunes store had to be on windows

um

so that's actually getting the ipod on windows

getting the ipod on windows was the key thing in the store

yeah

they all go hand in hand

um

um

it was

it was about putting itunes itself on windows

which ena the ipod to work on windows

and you know it was

it just took time

it took time and it it took some numbers

you know

i

i

i give that decision credit to phil

um

phil did a lot of leg work to really show what the opportunity was

uh

by moving it over to windows

and you know

at some point

when steve is the only person in the room saying don't do it

and there's good data from marketing saying this makes a lot of sense

and everybody saying this makes a lot of sense

he gets convinced

yeah

but it took a while

so so culture

i remember being kind of crest fall with steve

i remember that the itunes product

you know

announcement and getting my 15 minutes and going in there

and and steve had clearly gone such an entertainment direction

he could see that that's the way the product was going to grow

and i was still back in that camp of

you know

the computer is a bicycle for the mind

and you know

you know i wanted to see the next version of hypercard

which was was dead

and he obviously understood what was happening in the world

and i don't know

do you understand that kind of d dichotomy that that the

# Chapter 7

and everybody saying this makes a lot of sense

he gets convinced

yeah

but it took a while

so so culture

i remember being kind of crest fall with steve

i remember that the itunes product

you know

announcement and getting my 15 minutes and going in there

and and steve had clearly gone such an entertainment direction

he could see that that's the way the product was going to grow

and i was still back in that camp of

you know

the computer is a bicycle for the mind

and you know

you know i wanted to see the next version of hypercard

which was was dead

and he obviously understood what was happening in the world

and i don't know

do you understand that kind of d dichotomy that that the

the pc was becoming an entertainment device or computing was becoming entertainment centric

well

you're probably talking now about the whole um digital hub strategy

yeah

right

photos

movies

music

all with computers at the center

yeah

i mean that was just that was one of the things where steve was

um

really good at putting together a general message or a good message to explain why we're working

we're working on

and so you know

why do you have fire wire

you have fire wire

so you can get fast

io to a camcorder

right

and you know you have to have your music somewhere to sync it

at least back then you had to sync from a computer

and you want your photos to organize on your computer

so it all makes sense

as a nice package

it could

he could have come up with something else as well

it just happens to be the one that he thought thought of

based on the things that we were working on

that all looked promising

yeah

yeah

how much were you involved in in shepherding the development of itunes

um

i wasn't that involved in itunes

itunes

was

uh

done

after we acquired

um

uh

what was the name of the app

sound

jam

sound

jam

yeah

sound jam

and so we acquired sound jam

and then that morphed itself into

i

right

right

um

what

what

what led you to decide to leave

okay

so after after being the chief software technology officer for a little while

um

he was almost three

wasn't it

three years

it was close to three years

maybe

yeah

so

a while into that

it was becoming frustrating for both me and for steve

and it was frustrating because i was there to offer my opinions on things

and that was not good for steve because steve wanted to offer his opinions on things

and so we'd go from review to review to review

and he wanted it to be the steve jobs review show

but i had my own ideas and sometimes we'd agree

sometimes we'disagree or sometimes we just talk about different things that are completely complimentary

and so there was this tension

um

and i like to to think of it in terms of

of

steve

was never the kind of person that had a staff person working for him

just kind of doing things to help him out

was

that was

he was always hands-on um

he wanted to be the person that knew all the functions and the only person knew all the functions

but if i'm now following him around a lot and i'm learning all the different functions too

he's kind of giving up a little bit

so it was kind of

it was a little bit stressful for both of us

and like we had known each other for so long that it was just

it was kind of working

uh

um

but you know

there was that

and there

this other

unfortunate

um

mostly unfortunate thing where

on the executive team

i was the person that had the least responsibility by a large margin

um

i didn't have any day-to-day product that i was worried about

whereas everybody else around the table

oh my god

i got to get this thing done this week

or we're going to fail

right

or huge issues

even illegal

there were huge issues

because every week there was a bunch of lawsuits right

um

and so i think you know no one

no one actually complained to me

but i think there was some back channel to steve that my job was too easy

okay

for still having that kind of a role

and so for all these reasons we just kind of decided

the best way to resolve this is for me to just quit leave the company

because then all these issues go away and i'm adding some value to him

but you know he's going to figure these things out for himself for the most part

anyway

yeah

right

and so we just kind of mutually agreed that that was the best result

um

solved a lot of problems

um

in you haven't asked

but i'll tell you in retrospect

i think it was a huge mistake for both of us and

um

neither one of us could have known at the time

of course

um

but we probably should have

and

and i think it was a huge mistake for both of us because

well

for me

i mean i left just before the main inflection point of the company having massive success

okay

and so part of me misses being there to experience that part of it

having laid all the groundwork for it

you know what i mean

i do

and and i balanced that against

it was hard working there

but having a similar role like that

that would have worked well

like like with other types of ceos

maybe it would have been interesting

okay

so that that part was wrong for me

and it was wrong for steve

because i think he really lost something

by not having me around to just bounce ideas off or get sanity checks on

or whatever

whether it's things going on in the market or things going on in the organization

and especially

as the years went on

he became sicker and it was harder for him to do everything he wanted to do

i think you know i could have helped out even more

so i mean it didn't hurt the company at all

it didn't really hurt me right

um

we

we're

the company's fine

i'm fine

but in retrospect

i do think it was a mistake for both of us

yet

because of who we were

it was just hard to make it work

did you ever have a chance to have the conversation with him

that conversation with him after never

never

never

no

never

and when you left

did you have a clear idea of what you would do after leaving

um

when i left i assumed i just going to retire

which is basically what i did

yeah

yeah

okay

you know

i thought maybe there was a chance that i would take on another operating job

maybe as a ceo of a midsize company

that would take a chance on me as a ceo

um

but i also knew that it would have to be something really exciting to want to take it

yeah

because you know there's no amount of money they could have offered me to make me want to take it

so have to be something i really want to do

and i i really enjoyed not being in a situation of those n9 to5 meetings

under the gun

to ship a product

all the time

you know

people always complaining to you about who knows what

yeah

did you get a lot of offers for the kind of jobs you didn't want to do

uh

no

not really

yeah

no

interesting

because you're the l

i'm

i'm surprised because you have a set of talents that is kind of unique in the valley

well

it's

it's probably the case that

um

i never

lots of recruiters called and i never return the calls

okay

so so that answers the question

yeah

there

there was

probably

i mean there were definitely ct

many cto type jobs out there where there'd be some cryptic message

from a recruiter which i would just delete

yeah

many

many of those

i mean i did do some boards

i still do some boards

that's a different kind of thing

that's a a more natural thing to do

but never

really

i mean there were

come be cto of this huge company

i'm like

i have no interest in doing that at all

yeah

yeah

so i don't even consider that to be an offer

i never got

nothing ever got to that stage

i'm

i'm conf

confused on timing

were you gone

um

both

before the stock option

um

controversy

and were you gone before steve got sick

so um

i was gone before the stock option controversy

um

but i was there when he was sick

yeah

sorry

okay

yeah

and did i mean

to what extent

did you know

did sometimes people cut off people when they leave

did steve and you keep a relationship and did it get minimal

um

his general mo was that he spent his time with people who were useful to him at the time

and so i became not useful to him

yeah

and so i mean

if i ran into him

he would be friendly

in fact

i think

like month later i ran into him on a beach in hawaii

we're both vacationing our families at the same time

and he was fine and cordial

and all that

and if i were to send him an email on something

he would respond

yeah

um

but he really had no need for anything that i was doing at the time

and there was not really any reason for me to contact him

yeah

at least not all that much

yeah

and so we just kind of didn't keep in contact that much at the end of his life

when he got very sick

did you guys have have any contact

no

not really

yeah

no

and you know

i

i wish i had known just how sick he was like the month before

because then i would have initiated something

but i didn't

yeah

and the that you know when he sort of threw fred under the bus and all of that did

did

i mean you were

let's see

let's see

you became a partner

fred's after that

is that

right

yes

yeah

so

at the time i didn't really know many of the facts of what had gone on

i i knew some of them

obviously i was personally on the receiving end of some of the things

and i kind of knew what had happened there

and i'm just kind of reading what's in the press

yeah

um

but you know

look

i did not like seeing what happened to fred

um

but i really couldn't evaluate much of anything

at the time

anyway

yeah

yeah

um

would you just tell us a little bit of the story of elevation

um

how

how did it come to happen

yeah

so

um

fred anderson is one of the founders

and so i knew fred very well

of course

having worked with him at apple for many years very closely

we become great friends

and

uh

they founded their fund in i think 2006

and i was an lp in the fund

and so i got to know all the other partners

um

you know

roger

mamy

bono

mark bodnick and the others

um

and so

around the end of 2009

they asked me if i wanted to join them as an investor and i thought about it

and i

and it's like

actually

this is perfect

because in my quote retirement

i've been doing angel investing but not a lot of it

because as an engineer

i can find everything wrong with every business plan instantly

okay

so i can find every reason not to invest in a company without thinking very hard at all

so i wouldn't invest in very many companies

and

uh

and i found it to be somewhat of a lonely thing

because it was just me

and i'd have to meet entrepreneurs who didn't have offices and coffee shops was kind of weird

yeah

and i'm like

oh

this is great

you guys have a big fund you do big investments

the whole investment team love to join you and keep investing

and so i did

and and so we did

and did you get an area of responsibility in terms of the

you know

the technologies or the industry

or was it all

was it all

was it not that structured

completely unstructured

um

but obviously i was the technology expert

and so

whenever someone wondered is this likely to work

i would say yes or no

or try and figure it out

i i've known roger mamy in many roles over a long period of time

he must have been an interesting partner to have

yes

yes

love

roger

he's a

he's a character

interesting

i have a question

um

did you ever consider starting a new company a startup

so i did start a startup

funny

you should ask that

um

and

uh

so i started started a startup

which failed

because it

was

it was

ahead of its time

um

i started a company

that was this idea

the idea was to use um crowdsourcing to predict the stock market

and so the idea is

the idea was if you could get lots of consumers to come to your website

and to tell you what they think about various companies

then you can predict the future stock price

so

uh

consider

if

uh

let's just use apple as an example

if people start basically sentiment analysis if people are feeling good about apple

because you're seeing a lot of people at apple stores

then that's going to be a predictor of good earnings

which is a predictor of the stock price going up

and so you would try to attract people to the website to get them to basically give you their sentiment

voting up

voting down

if you will

consumer type companies

and if you could collect enough data and you could data mine that

so it's crowd sourcing and big data

getting all the keywords in here in a crowd-based platform

right

cloud-based platform

you could now predict the stock market

but it preceded social networking and everything else

and so

just as we were starting to run out of funding

facebook started becoming interesting

and this would have been a great tie into facebook

where you're now sharing your thoughts

and getting other people to participate

and give their thoughts and have it you a certain amount of verality to it

but you know

we gave up on the idea and folded the company

so it it was a learning experience

did you come to market or did you not get

we had a website that was up and running

so it was working

we never got a lot of traction

what was the company called

it was called pick them

and what year was that

uh

this would have been we probably started in 2007

uh

and we probably closed it down in 2009 or so

something like that

yeah

somewhere around then

c

can you give us your thoughts about

uh

tim cook as the

you know

the leader of apple and sort of you know what your

your perspective on tim is

yeah

so

uh

first of all

i consider tim to be a friend and i think he's just a tremendous individual

i think he has

um

really stepped up into the new role that he has as ceo

and

um

i've seen him grow a lot from when i knew him as a coo

in terms of the kinds of things he does

i think

um

what else do i think

um

you know

i think he's got an incredibly difficult job

um

running this huge company and trying to

you know

his

his background in operations

i think is very useful

because they have to keep the trains running on time with

that kind of magnitude whenever they have a new product that comes out

the scale at which it comes out is enormous and they can't afford mistakes

um

and i think under his leadership they've done a really good job of that

i think you know

if i were to be critical at all and i hate to be critical of tim again

he's a friend

i think he's doing a great job

i mean technology is not a strength right

and so

# Chapter 8

um

you know

i think he's got an incredibly difficult job

um

running this huge company and trying to

you know

his

his background in operations

i think is very useful

because they have to keep the trains running on time with

that kind of magnitude whenever they have a new product that comes out

the scale at which it comes out is enormous and they can't afford mistakes

um

and i think under his leadership they've done a really good job of that

i think you know

if i were to be critical at all and i hate to be critical of tim again

he's a friend

i think he's doing a great job

i mean technology is not a strength right

and so

um

there's probably some innovation that they're probably not keeping quite the same pace of innovation they otherwise would

but what i like to say is they're staying ahead of the competition

and that's the most important thing

it's like staying ahead of the bear

staying ahead of your friend when the bear is chasing you right

so it doesn't matter how innovative they are

so long as they're ahead of the competition

and i think they've done a great job at doing that

yeah

um

what about

um

your

the

your successors in

um

in leading soft

for brron and scott

and now craig fed

so

uh

they're all friends of mine

we all work together right next

ironically

um

all very different individuals

i think they all have brought success to the job in a lot of different ways

you know

brron

of course

the techie of them all always worried about how the tech works

less about the management parts of the job

but again

good enough to do it

i thought

um

scott was an incredible person

incredible engineer

incredible manager

with

you know

a couple of issues that caused him to not get along with everybody all the time

um

and his style of management worked great

working for steve jobs

because steve was okay with conflict

and steve would mediate conflict and kind of make sure everything was taken care of without steve there

you know

scott's style of management was not always going to work best

even though i mean

scott

very often would make the right call at the right time

it was hard to see him ever making making a d callin

i remember

i mean i told scott many years before he got the job

just

you know

work on a few things here

getting along with people

don't just manage up

like you do with steve

a few things like that

and you're gonna have this job in a few years and he did

and you know some of the things i tried to get him to improve on

he didn't quite improve on enough

um

or else

i think he'd still be there and be very successful

but great guy overall

and i think he's perfectly happy doing other things now

anyway

craig

so craig

um

left and then came back

um

to take the job

and i think the world of craig as well

i think

uh

craig has a really good balance of understanding the technology and being a good manager

maybe one of the better balances of all of them

yeah

trying to remember

now

did you ever

you know

craig gets up on stage and does demos and stuff

did

did you have that role

did you

did you do demos

public

um

i did do some demos

um

so i would do them regularly at the wwc's

yeah

so they'd be a steve keynote and he'd invite me up for 5

10

15 minutes and do a demo with him

um

occasionally at a mac world

um

you know

over time

those things kind of dwindled and steve tended to do most of them himself

um

but i i did do some of them

yeah

those

those

as

as he perfected that

i mean

you know

from

i mean it started in the early 80s

but then it sort of ramped up and they became like rock concerts

i mean they

i mean

from from my perspective

it was like going to roide because it was a

it was a

you know

it was a

it was a staged event that was

you know

there were even like the

you know

there were people cheered at the same things

one more thing became this kind of you know joke for a while and they were really quite amazing

uh

well

you guys in the press made it that way

right

so i mean it was a

it was a pr strategy

which is you keep things secret

you unveil it all at once in a big way

right

and then the press goes crazy over it

you get tons and tons of media exposure

right

you've got a couple follow-up stories to go along with it

and

um

so it worked

it worked

it was

it was really quite remarkable

um

i will add

it was also remarkable because the products were remarkable

so it

these weren't empty

you know

keynotes

right

i mean they were chalk full of really good stuff and you know

no matter how staged it was

if

if there was no beef there

it wasn't going to work

yeah

there's plenty of beef

yeah

was it stressful to give those keynotes

um

well

you know

again

my part in them was always small and so it wasn't that stressful

you know

things

we generally knew

things were going to work you know the the

from the engineering perspective

the most stressful part is just hoping and praying the demos work right

because you're always showing something is not quite done

and you know

if he veers off script and does something that wasn't expected and it doesn't work

oh my god

that's horrible

but the shows themselves were generally well planned

well executed

and so they weren't stressful

my part of it was a little stressful because you get up in front of a big crowd

but i'done it enough that it was okay

yeah

you talked about that that that you know

trajectory of 16 years

sort of developing product and this a hard question

but but is there something you're most proud of

i mean that you know

really

you know

you really take pride in from of of all the things you worked on

i mean if you had to

boy

that is a really hard question

because you know there's no one thing per se

i guess if i had to answer

what i would say

is that

um

when we

it was sort of in that year or two after we joined apple

where we just kind of set a new tone for the company

um

a new culture

a new way of operating the whole company

that led and still leads to massive success

because i think those fundamental things which

as you know

apple's now trying to teach to incoming employees

i think those are fundamental things that we put in place that are now surviving the test of time

and continuing to make the company successful

and and the really great thing about it is not only has it yielded a company that's successful

but it's yielded huge improvements in technology for everybody

and i mean even if you don't use an iphone

i mean android has copied so much of it right that it's everywhere now

yeah

and

and so it's just mindboggling the impact

that that sort of our changes in those couple of years have had

even though in those years we weren't thinking about a phone or anything that people have today

you really did

i mean those up until you know you

you were almost there

till the iphone was introduced

i was designing the technology that made that

i would argue

made that leap to the rest of the population

right

i mean it was

it was

you know

it was off the desktop

but it hadn't gotten out where every everybody in the world could use the technology

now we're at that point

that's right

with everybody connected all the time

yeah

yeah

yeah

um

but

yeah

what do you think is critical about about

that culture that that you set up there at that time that persists to this day

and that will carry apple forward

um

like

what's the difference

what's the apple difference

i think i think what we did

which m certainly made the difference then

and i think continues to make the difference now is this focus on exemplary technology

which means you get exemplary products

by having exemplary people who focus on getting things done and getting things out

and

um

you can kind of break any of those and you don't get success right

or you don't

you

if you don't have great people

you don't get great technology

you don't get great products and you can have great people and great technology

but if you don't finish them and ship them

it still doesn't do any good right

so you kind of need all these things

and these are the things that we really instilled on everybody

um

and you know there's other things like everybody working toward the same goal and stuff like that

which you know

really kind of ties it all all together

but i think those are sort of the core things that we really instilled in everybody

which is

you know

our value here is

this isn't really a value statement per se

but our

our value is to create an excellent product that people can really use

which means

you got to get it out there

you got to have the channels for it for it's not just the product

it's the channels

it's the marketing

it's everything

it's

it's a whole thing

it's

it's the unboxing experience

so that people feel good about what they just purchased right

right

um

and that's sort of a a culture that we really put in place and held everybody toward those goals

how important is secrecy to that culture

um

you know

secrecy is on a completely different axis and secrecy is about

um

it's partly about not allowing current products to be killed

right

osborne

effect

we don't want that obviously

and it's partly about

um

making sure the competition doesn't see what you're doing

so they somehow steal your thunder and who knows what way

uh

and it's also about we just talked about a little while ago

having the big unveil

okay

where you've got this great thing that everybody's now seeing for the first time and every you know

a million people or more are live streaming it right

10 million

who knows what numbers they're live streaming to find out what's next

and secrecy gives you all of those things

yeah

yeah

secrecy does come at a cost

but generally

these things far outweigh those costs

yeah

i'm watching

um

i don't

tom guber came after you left

but he's was one of the architects of siri

and um

is someone i've known for a long time

and i'm watching him struggle in that framework

and apple has sort of opened the door for him to get out just a little bit

but i mean they're letting him talk at ted

which is just extraordinary that you know that somebody would would let someone from apple do that

cuz

that was

you know something wouldn't have happened

but he's

he's chafed at the you know that that system it worked very well

well

you know something things require not being secret

right

and so secrecy is not one size fits all

you have to kind of go with the flow and figure out what's going on

you know

if you're working on internet standards

you can't be secret by definition

yeah

so there's a lot of different degrees there

i have a steve question

and

and this is something i thought for some time

and i was wondering if you could tell me if it's accurate

you know

steve's given credit for lots of different things

and one of the things that i haven't seen

stressed as much but i've always thought is over a long period of time

he got the timing of technologies right

in some ways that i almost thought was spooky

because you can be too early

you can be too late

but he seemed to have some fifth sense for when a technology was rip for mass commercialization

am i

did you ever did it look like that to you at all

well

so i'm not even sure the premise of your statement is correct

i mean

obviously the cube and next step were too early

i know he made mistakes right

so

and and yet i think this

yeah

i think one of our strengths

um

which you're attributing

him

which is correct

is

um

we

like i said

we

we developed a prototype prototype tablet

right

but we elected not to ship it

because we just projected out who's going to use this and the answer was nobody or maybe five people

when everyone else hold five tablets right

so i think what he was good at

and what we were all good at was getting out of our tech skins

and figuring out what is the world going to do with this thing

okay

and is it ready

and maybe it's not quite ready

but in a year it'll be ready because we'll make it ready

okay

and so when we saw that

we could get all the elements together for a phone

it made sense

and

oh

by the way

next came the tablet

which now made sense

cu

we had all this connectivity right

and so so it was it

i'm not sure that it's that hard

um

i think it's really about having the ability to again step out from your normal technological skin

don't see things as an engineer or as a product person

and see things as the masses are going to see them

and will they want them and can they use them

yeah

but we clearly had technologies that were before their time

that we didn't ship for that reason

yeah

um

for my end

maybe

just one last question

have you ever considered a memoir

i'm not a writer

i'm not a writer

i mean if someone came to me

and wanted to write a book

and they just wanted to sit with me and i would tell them the story

i would probably do that and they would sell 20 copies right

but i can't see doing that myself

yeah

have you played with swift

um

just a little bit

not very much

what do you think of it

um

my general impression is they have made a really important step forward

um

it's going to be extremely successful

they're making the right decisions with it

i think developers are falling in love with

they're going to fall in love with it

it's a very positive thing for them to do

i was just wondering about your recent investing with um elevation

and i guess now with next equity next equity

yes

um

just

are you investing in software and where do you see the the software story going in the

in the near and far terms

okay

so let me talk about that

so

um

next equity is the fund that we have right now

which is in some form a successor to the elevation fund

but it's also a little bit different

the partners are a little bit different

uh

and and the we don't do

we don't do checks quite as big as elevation used to do

elevation

right

used to do checks in the hundreds of millions

we do

millions

uh

it's a much smaller fund where

uh

just a small number of partners

small

much smaller fund and we're basically investing in anything that relates to technology

we

uh

you know

we think technology touches everything these days

and it means there's an interesting technology angle to lots of different types of companies

# Chapter 9

the partners are a little bit different

uh

and and the we don't do

we don't do checks quite as big as elevation used to do

elevation

right

used to do checks in the hundreds of millions

we do

millions

uh

it's a much smaller fund where

uh

just a small number of partners

small

much smaller fund and we're basically investing in anything that relates to technology

we

uh

you know

we think technology touches everything these days

and it means there's an interesting technology angle to lots of different types of companies

and we look at them all

we invest in the ones that we think are good businesses

and so for us

the angle is

do we think this is a good business

have you had any exits yet

or is it really how we just started

we've not had any exits yet

i guess my last question is

uh

what do you think is

uh

apple's greatest challenge right now

apple's greatest challenge is probably staying innovative

given its size

you know they've got a huge

uh

installed base

uh

they have to worry about keeping that installed base moving forward

which generally leans toward incremental changes that are slow

right

that's the tendency there

but in the industry they serve

you still need to have new innovations

it doesn't mean they need to be whole new product categories

but they need to be basic innovations

even in in existing categories

and so staying innovative is probably their long-term challenge

so

the last time that i saw steve was a visit that i paid with steven ley in may of

was it

2011

so was about five months before

and one of the things he said that

um

he

he said that

you know

if i had enough energy i'd really like to take on detroit

and that was very striking

and i've often wondered

i have no idea

because the

you know

you saw

they just got a a license for testing a prot

you know

i was wondering whether tim cook was sort of honoring steve's sort of

you know

spirit

or his interest in in starting a self-driving car company

self-driving car project

well

i

i think at this point it's fair to say that tim would be pursuing things

assuming he thought they made sense to pursue

and he's on record as saying transportation is obviously a big industry

which leads people to believe that they're working on something in that space

exactly what it is

they won't say

yeah

yeah

but i mean

look when your apple size to move the needle

you want to look for big industries right where you can really again move the needle

yeah

and there's not a lot of them

yeah

yeah

have you looked at flying cars at all

you know

never looked at flying cars

i'love to have one

there are a bunch of startups around

i mean i just made a list of 14 flying car startups including air

including airbus

it's of the largest

but so that's

that's from my end

that's great

that's

is there anything that we've missed

that's always a good question

oh jee

yeah

you know something something bur

well

as soon as you know

5 minutes after we're done driving away

i think of something

oh my god

weot to talk about this

um

you know there's so much that that happened

it could never will be covered

i think i think we covered most of the highlights

we can always do another session if we have to

yeah

great

i guess

u

i don't know if this is something you'd be comfortable answering

but i i was just wondering

you know

the day that steve passed

um

maybe what were your feelings

then

um

so i remember that day

well

because

um

that day i was taking my daughter to a volleyball practice

and just as we were walking into the gymnasium

my iphone started beeping with phone calls and text messes

messages all from the press

oh

and so i knew exactly what had happened

i didn't even have to look at any news or anything

i knew what had happened instantly um

and you know

i mean

look

we all knew he was sick for many years

right

um

i knew very early on just how sick he was

um

and you know

i

even though i hadn't met with him person

i still talk to people who knew a good amount of what the situation was

so it was like

gee

this is really sad

but it finally happened

because you know

in in some way

you all

we knew the situation was dire because of the disease

yet you always wanted to believe he would find a way to avoid the inevitable

i think he believed that

right

yeah

and

um

but it was just sort of wow

this is really sad

and then i went in and watched my daughter's volleyball practice

well

thank you very much

thank you

my pleasure

yeah
