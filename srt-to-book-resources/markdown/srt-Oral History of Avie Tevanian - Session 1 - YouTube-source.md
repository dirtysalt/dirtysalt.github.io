# Chapter 1

um,

so we're here for um

oral history of avi tavanian

and it is febian

tanian

already started with thank you. uh

avitanian

and it's february 21st and i'm john maroff

and hansen

sue is to my left

and david brock is to my right

and on we go.

so can we start by um

having you tell us

uh

where and when you were born.

sure.

i was born in portland, maine back east in 1961.

okay.

and um

can you tell us something about your family and how your family came to to maine

and

um

you know a little bit of their origin?

so

uh

i'm 100 % armenian. both of my parents are armenian and both of their parents

all of my grandparents came over in the early 1900s from armenia.

um

as part of the um

you know war with the turks. um

i should know more about that than i actually do.

uh

certainly heard a lot of stories about that when i was younger and mostly forgotten them. um

so anyway, my grandparents came across literally on the boat.

um

they had children.

uh

my

dad

my dad's family went to portland, maine. my mom's family went to worcester, massachusetts. somewhere along the way

they met each other. don't know how that happened.

um

they got married and i was her oldest son.

and was armenian spoken in the household when you were growing up? it was a little bit

uh

my parents were both fluent in armenia. armenian.

they would usually use it when they didn't want us kids to know what they were saying. um

but we knew a few of the words ourselves.

not enough to converse with them, but we could usually figure out what they were saying. yeah.

yeah.

and what did your parents do?

so my mom was some kind of bookkeeper before she was married.

when she got married, i think she gave up that career, just became a full-time mom.

i came pretty early on after they got married and she had four boys

so we kept her busy.

um

my dad started out

um

basically

uh

well

when he was very young

like 10, 11, 12,

very poor family

obviously coming from armenia

in portland

and

uh

he worked when he was very young and tried to also go to school. so he would

in portland

he'd go down to the warf in the morning like 3 : 00 a.

m.

4 : 00 a.

m.

when the fishing boats were coming in.

he'd buy the fish from them, take them to the supermarkets and try to make some money doing that.

then he go do a paper route and just anything that he could

um

while still going to school.

uh

he then went into the army for world war ii. he was a machinist.

he was always good with his hands.

uh

he was literally in the action, not on the front lines, but right behind as a machinist.

he would go and fix tanks when they broke down or whatever else.

then he came back and he was basically

um

you know

he did jobs where he could use his hands for a while working in machine shops,

worked in a christmas ornament factory for a while

if i recall correctly

and then he basically became an entrepreneur in the late 50s

um

which of course is before i was born.

he saw an opportunity

or he saw a movement of drive-in theaters

and so he bought some land just outside of portland and built a drive-in theater

which exists today and is still a family business.

oh wow.

um

he

then

in the 60s

um

while also operating the um drive-in theater

bought a bowling alley out of bankruptcy and rebuilt that business and turned it around.

i spent many hours working in that bowling alley myself. um,

and then as my younger brothers were getting to the age

where they would go out

and get jobs

and stuff, he built a business beside the bowling alley, which was at

that time a retail boat business, which then got morphed into other fun toys like snowmobiles, motorcycles, things like

that,

which a couple my brothers still run. your dad's sort of entrepreneurial gene. um, it's interesting.

he started sort of as bluecollar worker. yes.

and but going back, do you know if there was an entrepreneurial history in the in the family in armenia? i mean, what pushed him toward business? um,

you know,

i i really don't know.

um,

i mean, it's

it was so long ago

and we lost him about 30 years ago, so it's been a while since i've heard any of the stories.

um

he

you know

he grew up in the age himself

where you had to work hard just to put food on the table

and he was helping put food on his family's table by doing that

and so i think you learned a lot from being in the army

especially in world war ii

and he was just always looking for ways to better his family's life and so i think

when he got to a certain point of um

affluence

if you will

i mean by the time i was born and growing up

we were definitely middle class.

um,

you know,

by working hard for many years, earning a salary, and i'm sure saving it like crazy.

um,

i think he thought he could take a little more risk, which was, you know,

building the drive-in theater to get beyond just having the regular 9-to-five type job. but he was

he was

he was not just a typical,

even though he started out as a blueco collar worker, he was not typical.

i remember

when i was younger, he taught me about how the stock market worked, which i thought was, you know,

even back then,

not many people even invested in the stock market. you had the wall street journal with the, you know,

the quotes in the back of the paper every single day.

it was only you got stock quotes, but he was into that and he'd show it to me.

so, he was interested in these other things beyond just the blue, the blue collar type stuff.

yeah. um, could you say a little bit about your brothers?

um, and what did they go in a technical direction

just sort of general? so, i'm completely different than my brothers.

um, they all went into the hands-on type businesses themselves.

the, in fact, the three i have three younger brothers.

they all went into the family business focusing on what would again start out as the boat business.

now, my father actually died shortly after that was set up and operating,

and he had always intended that that was something they could do with their lives,

and they ended up doing that

because he wasn't there to run anymore.

so they kind of learned trial by fire on some of that.

i had one brother who worked building yachts for a while up at a place in maine

and doing some other things like that.

but two of them still do that today. okay. and sort of characterize what the household was like

grow,

you know,

your home was like growing up. were dinner table conversations lively? sort of stylistically.

what was the family like? yeah, it was kind of crazy with four of us boys. uh

you know

in retrospect

um

in some sense it was a traditional armenian family in that

you know

my mom was just a great cook making traditional armenian foods

and so you know nothing

i would have appreciated at the time

of course

it was just dinner right

but

um

it was

it was something that i think was just really good for our upbringing

we always saw our dad as a hard worker

going in early in the morning

coming back late at night

um

when we were old enough to know he

when he was rebuilding the bowling alley.

um,

my brothers and i were all close.

we'd do things together all the time.

we lived in a neighborhood that was friendly.

doors were always unlocked.

we knew all the neighborhood kids.

we'd go outside on the street, play kickball.

we'd go down the street and find a big field and play baseball.

all those kinds of things. but this was

this was typical of the, you know,

60s and early 70s.

um

you know

many evenings we'd all stay home and watch tv around the the one

family tv like again

like everybody did with

sometimes with our tv dinners.

i became a huge star trek fan then

right when it came out.

and so if your brothers went into the family business

was there something

why did you go in a different direction? i was always the different one.

so when i was very young

they knew that i had an aptitude for math

is what it turned out

to be.

and so we'd all be in our station station station wagon driving along, the six of us, two parents

and four kids,

and my dad would be

th

would be shouting out math problems for me to solve.

and it would be, you know,

multiplication tables or things things like that.

but um

you know,

i was always the one that got good grades in school and homework was easy

and it was

it was more challenging for my brother.

so it was always new.

it was always informally known that i was kind of going to be the one to go off

and do something different.

yeah.

did you say you were the first? i was the oldest. yes.

okay. yes.

and any idea what where the aptitude for math came from? um,

you know,

i i think both my parents were pretty smart.

i can't say that either one of them was particularly good at math.

and i'm pretty sure that

by the time i got to high school, i was doing more advanced math than they knew about

cuz they never helped me with homework.

and i'm not sure they could have at the time.

um

it's just i just got that gene from somewhere. yeah.

and and i had a love for it.

and i think maybe that's part of the genetics, too. yeah.

and in that period in the 60s

when you're growing up, religion and politics in your household, were there? um

the

the religion was minimal. uh

my mom was somewhat religious from massachusetts. she was a regular churchgoer and but we'd all worn her down

and the extent of her religion at

that point was to try to get us to go to church for christmas

or easter,

something like that. um

minimal politics.

um

my dad leaned republican as a businessman. um

he did run once for some city alderman position

and he didn't know what he was doing and he didn't win

but he only did that once. yeah.

was your mother orthodox? um

so i don't even know.

my mother

i don't

i don't know.

there was an armenian church though. there was an armenian church. uh

well

it was

that was a big deal in worcester where she came from.

um,

in portland

there was an armenian community

which i think went to an armenian church or an armenian dominated church. i'm not sure

because that was not my thing. yeah.

and portland, maine in the 60s and 70s.

um,

it was big enough

that we wouldn't call it a small town, right? how would you describe portland in in

you know your community in portland when you were growing up? was it suburban or urban or?

so i grew up, we lived in portland

when i was born and we moved from portland to a neighboring town, westbrook,

when i was in second grade.

so i was maybe six or seven years old

and westbrook was definitely the suburbs even though it was only four miles away.

um, so i i consider myself as growing up in the suburbs.

and

when we got old enough, we had dirt bikes

and we literally drove the dirt bikes a quarter of a mile down the road to

where the trails were

and there were trails there. and and uh

it's

it's probably worth mentioning.

i mean, my brothers and i, i mean, me being more of an academic type person

had this exposure to all these things that academics normally don't get exposed to.

like we'd go dirt bike riding all the time over huge jumps,

you know,

doing crazy things. we look back, we don't know how we possibly survived.

with my brothers, we literally built a boat.

and it was a high-speed boat that went 90 to 100 miles an hour called a drag boat.

quartermile drag boat. and we

we

we

what the time would have been called mailordered a small fiberglass hull from somewhere in california

that got shipped out.

um

actually

that was our second boat. our first boat

we literally got plywood, we bought frames, plywooded it, and fiberglassed it ourselves.

that boat probably went 70 miles an hour

and my brother

and i were driving in it at one time

and i looked over the side and i it was blue.

i see this blue flap

and it was fiberglass starting to come off my motion.

i said we better go back quickly. when we got back it had all ripped off on the bottom

just the plywood.

so it was interesting growing up in a family like that

because of all these other experiences

that i think most of the people i know today never had anything like it.

yeah.

um

and somehow we all survived it. and um

in in your school in

i guess

in in the in the suburban in westbrook, you know,

science and technology,

did you get exposed to besides sort of math, was there,

you know,

would you call

i

i guess i would call it

um

sort of fallout from sputnik? did

did you have a science education in

yeah,

we had a science education and a math education.

you know, we're talking rural maine now

or semi not way out in the boonies, but we're near portland, so we've got good teachers.

we've got money for the schools. we've got good schools. um,

and to to me it was a good exposure.

westbrook had a very good school system. um,

and you know, it it today you go to a lot of schools

and there's all these different lanes and different tracks and you're on the advanced lane

where you're learning calculus as a junior or even earlier

sometimes

and the low lanes where you're kind of struggling to get algebra done.

we had one lane with some honors classes

and that was it

and that was only in math.

we we had that in some science too. but i feel i got good solid exposure to the sciences

which i liked and to math which i liked.

and i think

um

maybe

more importantly, i think i was lucky in that

the school

when i went to high school, actually in 8th grade,

as i was preparing to go to high school, the school knew that i had some good math aptitude.

and so they kind of singled me out

maybe along with a few other kids to show us a few extra things and give us extra stuff.

so, i remember so vividly

when i was in 8th grade at the or high school orientation, they pulled me in

and they said, " and we have a computer.

" and i didn't even know what a computer was.

okay? i didn't know what a calculator was, nothing like that.

but they had a pdp8e and i didn't know what it did.

it was just this box that had some flashing lights and i just fell in love with it.

i'm like, " high school is going to be so cool. " uh,

and it was.

and so, you know,

i had a a teacher.

i had the same math teacher for three years, mr.

small, sophomore, junior, and and senior years. he had an advanced

uh

honors

uh

math class, which i was in.

and he would do other things after school that would enrich us even more.

so, while i mean, we did most of our pdp programming after school, kind of come in

# Chapter 2

maybe along with a few other kids to show us a few extra things and give us extra stuff.

so, i remember so vividly

when i was in 8th grade at the or high school orientation, they pulled me in

and they said, " and we have a computer.

" and i didn't even know what a computer was.

okay? i didn't know what a calculator was, nothing like that.

but they had a pdp8e and i didn't know what it did.

it was just this box that had some flashing lights and i just fell in love with it.

i'm like, " high school is going to be so cool. " uh,

and it was.

and so, you know,

i had a a teacher.

i had the same math teacher for three years, mr.

small, sophomore, junior, and and senior years. he had an advanced

uh

honors

uh

math class, which i was in.

and he would do other things after school that would enrich us even more.

so, while i mean, we did most of our pdp programming after school, kind of come in

and use it, right, for as much as you want, and there only half of us ever wanted to.

um, but he would do other things like offer a special class, learn how to programming.

we had an oliveti cash register that could be programmed in some way i can't even remember now.

and and so i would get access to all these sort of extracurricular things.

so this is by now we're in the early 70s

or is this well,

now you're mid to late 70s.

late 70s. okay. so was the pdpa connected to the outside world with a modem or anything

or was it just a standalone? it was a standalone computer with two

asr33 teletypes, which is where the normal

the computer quote

computer science class, there was no computer science class.

there was a math class

where you learned a little bit about programming it and you always used just the asr33s, right? um,

but again, they would let me go after school and load up different things into the computer.

so, everyone's using basic. i would learn focal.

i would learn how to program from the switches on the front.

um,

and i would write

and

and obviously my regular basic programs, but i could just do all these other things just to learn extra stuff

that weren't wasn't even being taught in class.

focal was lower level

or what kind of a program? it was another programming language.

i i can't even remember any details, but it was basic like i think

but what what really excited me was programming at the switches. yeah.

you know,

you select the address, you select the data in,

you know,

load

and that was it

and then run when you're done.

so is that

even

is that machine or assembler?

what would you machine code?

machine code.

yeah, you wrote out the bits. you can go

each switch was a bit.

yeah, that was

that was

i thought that was the best.

that's great. that that's great. and so would you call it was mr. small?

what did you think of him as a mentor? did he take you under his wing kind of?

yeah, i think he did. yeah.

and it was the computer stuff,

you know,

he sponsored our math team.

i became the captain of the math team.

had tremendous fun with that. he gave us all this extra stuff to do outside of class.

um

yeah,

and interestingly through all this i thought i was going to become a statistician because i was told

um by they

they would have career people come in for career advice and they say

oh

you

you guys that are really good in math

you're going to become statistitians

and now that would be a perfect career choice

because you could have gone right into machine learning and be set.

yes.

well, what actually what happened was

i think it was either my junior year or senior year,

we got some new fangled data

general computer that had memory and our our programs could be stored on it.

and this was a whole new paradigm for us programming

and it had a much more advanced basic and other ways to interact with it

and you could

we could like

like write

like real games and stuff on it. and i remember

um

you know

when i got to the school

the pdp was already installed up and running

but for the data general

it took like a week for some technicians to come in

and set it up and test it and do whatever they did.

and i at that point i said that's what i'm going to be

that's going to be my job. one of those people. and did it

when you talk about

did it come with games

like was adventure on it

or were there

and were you taken with games at all or were you more interested just in this was before adventure.

um

there was some game on it.

i think it was a very basic game that would have been a teletype type game.

i don't remember what it was

but i did

i did love it. yeah,

i did love it. and did math take over your life? i mean were you a math geek

or were you were there other subjects in school that caught your interest? so,

um

i guess i was probably a math geek then

because the computer science part of it was very minor.

although i liked working with the computers much more, right? i also enjoyed some of the scientists.

i really liked physics for some reason. something about that really really resonated with me. um

but when i went to college then it wasn't about math. it was about computers

and i went to university of rochester

which didn't offer computer science program

knowing i wanted to do computers.

so i was still sort of a quote unquote math geek

because i had to get a degree in math.

that's all they offered.

there was no computer science degree. but i spent all my time working on computers. yeah.

and before we leave high school, um

um

outside pursuits

like

like sports

and reading, were

were you a jock at all

or

um

so that that's an interesting question

because in middle school

of all things

it was all intramural sports

and i literally played every intramural sport that you could play

and i won an award for that in my eighth grade

like most intramural sports played something like that.

um,

but

by the time i got to high school, i wasn't good enough at any of the sports except for bowling

because we own the bowling alley.

very good bowler. probably could have become a professional galloping bowler. um,

but i wasn't really good enough at the other sports.

and i think it was more i wasn't big enough to play the other sports.

so, i didn't do them in high school other than recreationally, occasionally with friends.

i then got bigger in college for some reasons.

my i had a big growth spurt in college

and i'm actually much more athletic now than i was in high school.

so never get into sports per se.

that having been said,

my family spent every summer on a lake nearby where we had a summer place.

and so i became a very good water skier

and you know

to some people riding dirt bikes and things like that is very much a sport

in that it takes a lot out of you

when you're out on trails and it's bouncing around and you're hitting jumps and doing corners and everything else.

yeah. so there was that aspect of it. did your dad's background as a machinist

carry over? did you get into tinkering

or was there a machine shop at the house? did he had a machine shop at the bowling alley?

and we'd always joke it was behind the machines.

you the front of the house and then you've got behind the machines

and usually the only time you go behind the machines is to fix them.

he would go behind the machines to build things

and so he would buy equipment, lathes or what you know

massive drill presses, whatever.

and during the day

when he's supposed to be working up front, he would have someone else work up front

and go back and just build things.

on the weekends, he'd sometimes bring us in and show us how to do things.

but i personally had no aptitude for that.

um

that was my brother's when we built that boat.

we built an engine from scratch.

we went down to a chevrolet dealer

and ordered a bare block from and they're like, " what? " yeah.

well, okay.

we'll order it for you.

and they shipped it to our house and we bought all the other parts and built the motor.

now, that was all my brothers

cuz they had much more aptitude for that than i did.

gotcha. but i got to see it all happen. yeah.

and um

in high school, did you have any like

did you have to

did you work in the family business or did you have jobs?

um

good question.

um

so

in high school, uh

on weekends

definitely work at the bowling alley, help out in the morning on saturdays and sundays

when it would get busy.

sometimes help out during the week

on the evening

when there's a big league night,

but not too much because we had school to worry about.

the first real paying job i had was after my senior year

just before college at a company paper mill called sd warren.

and um

i won if you can win a job, i won this job.

they gave this job to a couple students in recognition of some academic whatever.

um

they

they were the local company in westbrook

and so they gave a couple jobs and the job was outside crew.

and you may ask,

well, what's outside crew?

well, let me just say

when we didn't have our normal job to do, we would go and we would sweep parking lots.

so, so

uh

we would do things like you'd go on the daily run around the paper mill to empty the trash cans.

um

you would be called on occasion to clean out a sewer, which meant taking these massive hoses with these um water jets

that shot backwards, sticking them into the sewer, then firing it up

and just having it bore through the sewer.

and it's a paper mill. things

these things would get plugged a lot and you just do all these crazy things throughout the mill.

so that was my first real job, which was interesting

because the next summer i worked at the paper mill again, but i worked in the research department programming their computers.

cool.

and what kind of machines did you have? that was still in high school.

no, that was after one year of college. okay. after my my first my

after my freshman year.

and the corporate computers of that era, what what did you do

you remember what they were? they deck micomp computers

or um

we had

so this was interesting because it was in the research lab and it wasn't really programming the corporate computers.

we got to do research projects where

uh

for example

so they would make paper and then they would code it

and there's all these different codings you could do

and in the research lab

they had a smallcale prototype coder where they'd run experiments and they had a control system on it

that was unlike what was in the mill

because in the mill it just did one thing right

but we could fully program it to control the coder

and and mostly get readings off it to figure out temperatures and all kinds of other things

and i got to do the programming on that

which i think was probably controlled by digital equipment, probably pdp type stuff.

and i love that because i got to work on all these programs to control equipment.

i mean, control real equipment. i i could control digesttors that would cook the pulp as it's being prepared

um to turn into paper to control the temperatures and heat and everything else.

and i and i could control the computers to basically run and monitor this coder.

it was

it was very cool stuff. excellent.

and so in that period through high school, so personal computers were starting to show up in the world.

microcomputers were starting to show up in the world in 75, but it sounds like you sort of grew up on many computers.

and when you were in high school, did pcs show up at all in your um

you didn't see that issue of popular computing that had the mitsal tear on the

it wasn't popular computing, it was popular electronics that had mitsal out there on the cover

or have your own computer kind of thing.

that was not even on our radar screen.

the closest thing

that we had to

that was i had, you know, the top line top-of-the-line ti handheld pocket, not pocket, the big ti calculators back then.

programmable programmable.

they were programmable.

yes. yes.

so so

um

and then

in terms of of going to school, what determined where you went to to college? almost accidental.

um

so you know,

obviously neither of my parents had gone to college. um

they

they were not

they were smart. they were not highly educated.

um

which was not uncommon back then. um,

i had

i mean i was

i was literally going high school for me was day-to-day whatever,

right? i'm having fun on the math team.

i'm having fun programming computers and no long-term planning.

someone's telling me i'm going to be a statistician, but i'm thinking i'm going to be a computer technician

installing computers, whatever.

and i i realized at some point

that i was going to go to college, but i knew nothing about college.

i knew nothing even about the application process.

and then i started hearing in the fall of my senior year about some of my friends who had been getting some early acceptances at colleges.

i'm like, really? i didn't even know you're supposed to like apply now, right?

and so somehow i figured out

and i think my parents started helping me a little bit, probably mostly high school counselors.

yeah, you need to apply to college.

and i had won this award

um

called the bosch and lom science award

which was awarded by bosch and lom in rochester, new york

um

back in the day, right? and they or they

they gave this award to an outstanding science student in every high school in the country.

and one of the benefits of that was you got a free application to the university of rochester.

and this is a really

it's kind of a sad but funny story.

so i had heard of rochester institute of technology being a technology person

and i figured that was one of the schools i would apply to.

and so i'm given this free application from the university of rochester. i think they're basically the same thing.

it never occurred to me they were different.

and i'm like this is great.

i get to save 50 bucks.

i don't have to pay them for the for the admission fee.

so, i sent it in and i sent in a couple others. um,

and um

the ones i remember i applied to were rochester, um,

princeton, mit, and tufts.

um,

uh,

both princeton and mit said no.

um, mit said no because they didn't like my essay.

and i remember at the time i made a mistake of not having anyone help with my essay.

and i'm sure it was a disaster.

um,

which in retrospect i should have done differently. both tus

and um,

rochester accepted me

and so we figured i just go to tus because it's pretty close. and we

we drove down there one day. it seemed like a fine school. and so we went,

that was a fine trip.

but then a friend of our family said, you know, you should look at rochester before you make the final decision.

so my dad and i got on a plane.

first time ever getting on a plane.

we we had to take a connection to get to rochester, new york. okay.

and and i remember going there

and

um

they said

well

you know

we don't have a computer science program

and i think tus might have had a minimal computer science program

there was pretty rare

but they took me in

they had graduate students

graduate computer science students

they took me into the lab

where the

where the graduate students worked

and they had a xerox alto

and i didn't know what a xerox alto was

but they showed me

this computer with a spinning globe on it

so here i am coming from a pdp8

okay.

and i see a computer with a graphical display with spinning color earth graphics.

i was just blown away. i didn't see anything like that at tus. yeah. okay.

and i'm like, okay. even though this

even though these are graduate students

and and they said, " and by the way,

you know, we can probably get you in here and give you some access.

" i'm like, " i have to come here.

" so, i decided to go there. and so, what year

would

what

what year did you enter? um

79. 79. okay. okay. so, the alto was pretty mature at that point. it was

uh

relatively

it was rare, right? but it was relatively mature. do you know why they ended up at why rochester?

do you know? was there a faculty member? xerox.

oh, of course.

yeah.

of course.

yeah. right.

xerox was a big supporter of rochester.

that's right.

that's right.

so, it was all accidental.

i thought i was applying to rit

and i i finally get to rochester. oh, that's actually a different school. but it's okay.

# Chapter 3

" i'm like, " i have to come here.

" so, i decided to go there. and so, what year

would

what

what year did you enter? um

79. 79. okay. okay. so, the alto was pretty mature at that point. it was

uh

relatively

it was rare, right? but it was relatively mature. do you know why they ended up at why rochester?

do you know? was there a faculty member? xerox.

oh, of course.

yeah.

of course.

yeah. right.

xerox was a big supporter of rochester.

that's right.

that's right.

so, it was all accidental.

i thought i was applying to rit

and i i finally get to rochester. oh, that's actually a different school. but it's okay.

it worked out.

so, so before leaving high school, um, did either video games

or computer networks show up on your your radar at

all

in video games were out in the world. we had a pong.

okay. so, we had the first ataris that came out. oh, the bowling alley.

no, no, no.

on our tv at home. okay. and i loved those things. yeah. right.

the video games in the bowling alies came a little bit later, but remember you could get pong

and you could get the basic atari thing.

um, may maybe you could get the video games in in the bowling alleys then too.

i don't remember. but it was very cool. very cool to have it. p

you could get pong.

that's right.

pong was first.

and so i remember falling in love with all that stuff.

yeah.

but to me, the notion of being able to program those things myself was completely foreign, right?

that was something way beyond what i even thought possible.

yeah.

at least for myself. yeah.

but the the family had some one of the video game like an atari or something to play.

yeah.

yes.

and but you weren't programming that. you were programming real computers. well, i mean, you couldn't really pro

it was an atari game console, right? and you bought the pre-programmed games.

you couldn't program them yourself. it was a big deal to program them. yeah. yeah.

so, um

um

tell us about the university of rochester and sort of what showing up as a freshman.

what was it like? would you living in a dorm? and and living in a dorm, i remember it

it was very hard for me. um

because i'd never been away from home before,

completely isolated,

no internet to send emails to friends or family,

right? no unlimited cell phone plan to call home.

there's one phone in the dorm and you have to pay long distance charges which i couldn't afford.

so, i was isolated.

and to make matters worse, i go to my first orientation meeting with a bunch of other freshmen

and they're all saying, " what's that weird accent you have? "

and had a really thick man accent at the time.

and i'm like, " oh my god, i didn't even know i had an accent.

what are these guys talking about?

they're all from new york and everything else. " and so it was

it was very hard yet. um,

you know,

by those day standards, they had great computing facilities

and again no undergraduate computer science program as a degree, but they did offer some classes.

and so of course

first semester i signed up for intro to programming

whatever it was where we learned pascal or fortrren or whatever.

and so i got an account on the ibm 3070

or whatever whatever it was at the time the big computer punch cards

and everything else.

and so um

that was for classwork.

and so i started using that

and i found another friend in my dorm who was also in the computers.

he wasn't quite a good programmer as i

but i

i would be in my dorm writing my programs

and then taking them in to the punch cards and so remember

in those days you had an allocation of computer time right

and it was all normalized to dollars you had

so we had like say $ 100 for the semester

i used it all up in like two weeks

okay

just writing my own programs and experimenting

and i

one of the first programs i wrote even without any assignments

was a program that would print posters because we want to put posters on our walls in our dorm

in the hall

in the hallways of the dorms. we had no way to do that.

so i said, i can write a program.

so i designed a font and did it all,

you know,

i encoded it myself and then wrote a program.

you just put in the cards for what i was going to print out.

and i got in big trouble for that

because i had these huge printouts coming out

which, you know,

some guy would, you know,

cut it off

and bring it to you

and start yelling at you, why did you do this? so i got in trouble for huge printouts.

i got in trouble for using up all my money,

but that was a blessing in disguise

because within the first couple weeks of this class, i had to go visit my professor

because i had no computer time left to do my homework.

so, so i had to explain to him how i'd used up all my computer time

and i was in fear.

but in retrospect,

i realized he said, " okay, this guy has selfidentified as someone who is really interested in this.

" so, not only did he fix my problem with computer time,

he said, " i want to introduce you to our graduate computer lab.

" i see.

so, and so back to the alto.

so, i got back into the alto.

not not quite into the alto then, but i started getting jobs working for computer science faculty.

okay. working side by side with graduate students, getting, you know,

paid, you know,

a reasonable amount of money.

i wasn't expecting to get any money, but they were paying me now. so in evenings and weekends

i would go in there

and i would either do the work i was supposed to do for the professor

or teach myself how to program the alto

or a lot of the work i was a lot of the paperwork i was doing was on a vax at the time.

um

so i got to use all the different systems. so you

you moved to computing right from the what was the math scene like? did you stay in the math program

and was it competitive and how did you stack up against

when you got to college? you've been a math star.

were you still a math star?

okay.

so my ego is usually in check, but there's one thing i have to say, which is at orientation,

they had us all in a big auditorium.

all the freshmen are going to say, " okay, you guys, you're all one of the top students at your high school.

now you're just one of the normal people.

" that scared me, but i still had no trouble there.

and in the math stuff, i was able to stay ahead of everybody.

computer science stuff, clearly it was not

it was still not a problem.

so i felt good about that.

and the math stuff i had to do because it was my degree. um

the

the

um

the math was getting pretty abstract and pretty complicated. and um

certainly

in the later years with the really advanced classes, i was more in the mode of okay,

i'm just going to figure out how to get an a in this class as opposed to really learning it.

and that's what would start to h to happen.

and i know i've every once in a while i'll find some old document in a closet.

and i found one a few years ago

which was some old math notes i had

and i looked at them

i i didn't even know what they were about.

so you know

i i've learn

i've lost lost so much of the knowledge.

on the other hand, i remember

um

i was still into sciences

and so i took chemistry

and physics

and other classes almost for fun, which in retrospect was kind of crazy, but i remember i took a lot of advanced physics classes

and i remember even though i was in advanced math, um

we got to a point in physics

where the professor said, " okay,

and so now we're going to do some differential calculus that you guys haven't got to in math yet.

" and so just trust me, this is how it works.

and that's when i said, " okay, this physics is getting a little too complicated for me.

" some particle physics and quantum theory. and i stopped.

so i'd had enough of that.

and then i just focused on the math.

but my time was all about the computers. and it wasn't even about the

i mean i took some good classes in compiler theory and other things

where i learned how to build compilers and did interesting things there

but it was all about being able to work with faculty and doing actual research with them

where they were doing research projects and i got to contribute to it. yeah.

and and and doing fun things myself, right? i i mean i

i

you talk

you asked about games before. i started writing games on eltos. what were your

so

what were early games that you wrote on

i may have played some of your games. you probably have

um

i

i

i forget what order i wrote them in.

i think the first one i wrote was i did knockoff games

cuz i wasn't creative enough to do original games. the first one was a knockoff of missile command.

okay.

i think that's the first one i did

because it was relatively straightforward for the graphics capabilities of the alto at the time.

didn't require too much microode.

and then the second one that i did was defender.

and defender was tricky

because the graphics on that are very intense and i had to write most of the game in microode.

oh wow. were there highlight was

was there pascal? well, there was small talk, right? did you learn?

no. small tech.

small talk was useless for games.

yeah.

okay.

i wrote in microode and bcpl.

didn't spend any time really in small talk.

that was too abstract a language for me.

yeah.

and and how about i mean the alto was such a statement about interface at that point.

i mean you had been in this asr world

and all of a sudden you were in this human machine interactive world.

did how did that i mean

did that play a role in shaping your outlook about computing?

um

probably you have to remember

i was still doing a lot of programming on the vax too. so i had a normal

was it a vt50 something or other

you know

screen

that i'd spent probably almost as much time using

for

you know

i'm writing when i'm writing my compiler

i'm doing that.

i was doing some vssi design work, some design checkers.

i was using that with big data.

um, so i spent probably roughly equal amount of times

and and but i really loved the graphics part of the alto

and just i

i

what i really loved about the alto also was the fact that you could write microode

and you could get right in there

and it was literally the case

that

that your program could break the computer if you didn't have the right weight states in the right spots.

bad things would happen to the computer

and so i had to be really careful about that

and i there's something about that

i always like to be really close to the metal

did maze wars exist

i think so

and were they were

the altos connected

the altos were wereworked

and

uh

my adviser later on at carnegie melon

rick

rashid had written with jean baltre

which inspired me to do the other games

okay

so you saw it before you met

rick

or rick had already left

rick

rick was a graduate student at rochester

just prior to my arrival there

and then he went off to be faculty at carnegie melon

and so i i was able to see track

which of course i loved.

yeah. right.

that was clearly one of the

that's probably one of the very first network games. yeah.

and were you already just in terms of your your studies and your interests

was there already an os direction in as an undergraduate? no,

because people didn't really talk about os's then. it was

i would say it was an interest in low-level software. so close to the mission.

was there an os on the alto?

yes.

did i care about it? no.

because i was writing to the bare metal.

and as soon as you launched the defender program, it took over everything.

i didn't use any of the ui elements that the os provided. none.

yeah.

um,

so that never really occurred to me.

and all the interesting to me, all the interesting games, trek, i was

i loved clint parker's pinball game. remember pinball?

that was awesome. these are things that motivated me and they completely took over the whole computer.

and did you have a view into park? did park show up on your world view as an undergraduate

where allen's group lrg or any of the other

not at all.

yeah.

not at all.

it was so disconnected and well i should say if it did

i don't remember.

this is a long time ago. so it's entirely possible that it did.

it's just that i've kind of blanked it out. yeah. yeah.

and so at that point had personal computers begun to be accessible at rochester

or were you still a big computer guy? personal computers were accessible. the alto

there

there was an undergraduate lab

which fortunately i didn't have to use

which had

uh

was it the commodore pets

and then they had some apple 2. okay.

and so before i got to spend a lot of time in the in the graduate lab, i did spend some time there,

which again this was all outside of class,

but i would do silly things like i would create

um

so let's say there was um

eight of these computers. i can't remember whether whether it's the commodore or the apple,

i don't remember.

i would write a program that would play music

and i would have an instance running on each computer simultaneously

each playing a different part.

cool.

i would do stupid things like that. that's very cool. for the audience

in that case was you? it was me.

it was me just to show that i could do it.

i'have to figure out a way to get them all started at the same time. yeah.

but that would probably be by bringing in friends or something. yeah. that's a classic hacker behavior. yeah.

i mean, you were pushing the machine to its limits.

i would just try to think about what could i possibly make this thing do that's never done before.

interesting.

and um

how much of your life was computing during college? i mean, were you just sort of swept into the computing world?

and i was swept into it all my spare time.

okay. so, today it would be worse because today you're always connected. so, you know,

at least then

when i went home, i was disconnected. yeah.

but i would be connected a lot in the office or in in the lab for many many hours.

yeah. was rochester an arpa site? did you have connection to the arpanet

or was it something that you were aware of?

um

i don't think we were an arpa site at the time

because we did all of our external email with ucp in uset.

so we probably were not an arpa site at the time

or it may have just been barely coming in. yeah.

yeah.

and um

in terms of the people who were influential

um

the computer scientists at rochester as being very influential on your development

as as a young computer scientist? um

this again

this is a long time. i remember

um

first of all

i remember a lot of them were tall and i'm tall

and i wonder if there's some correlation there between tall and computer science.

i was thinking that at the time.

this is interesting. they're all 6 feet and above and i'm like 6'2, 63.

um,

so that was the first thing that i thought was an interesting correlation.

um,

there were a bunch of guys there. i have a hard time remembering their names. um,

who are very influential.

one was i already mentioned

uh

clint parker

who he wasn't that active

when i he was

he was officially a graduate student

but he wasn't that active.

i think he'd been there for a while.

he had done the pinball game and he had done a lot of really low-level groundbreaking elto stuff.

i know i leveraged some of his stuff in some of my games. he would do like he would

he wrote the classic super fast multiply divide for the elto

and i lifted that and put it in.

and there a few other things that he had done that i i would just kind of take from.

i was inspired by the work rick and gene had done on track

even though i'd never met them. um

there were some people there who were starting to do some experimenting with networking

which i was just kind of learning about. i don't remember who they were.

yeah. but

um

it's

it's so long ago. i

i

i

i definitely had good relations with faculty. um

you know

the

the person i was working for for most of the time was a vssi per vssi design person.

and at that point in time, the the design tools for vlsi were very primitive.

and he hired me to write a design rule checker program, which had never been done before,

# Chapter 4

i know i leveraged some of his stuff in some of my games. he would do like he would

he wrote the classic super fast multiply divide for the elto

and i lifted that and put it in.

and there a few other things that he had done that i i would just kind of take from.

i was inspired by the work rick and gene had done on track

even though i'd never met them. um

there were some people there who were starting to do some experimenting with networking

which i was just kind of learning about. i don't remember who they were.

yeah. but

um

it's

it's so long ago. i

i

i

i definitely had good relations with faculty. um

you know

the

the person i was working for for most of the time was a vssi per vssi design person.

and at that point in time, the the design tools for vlsi were very primitive.

and he hired me to write a design rule checker program, which had never been done before,

where you make sure it's actually probably going to work

and not, you know,

short circuit immediately, right? um

i did some um computer

uh

computer vision work, very early computer vision

where the hard

i mean you had to like figure out how to do an edge detector, right?

and now that's all given, right? uh

with

um

i think his name was chris brown

who's doing some early work in computer vision

which now seems so basic. um

and then i got

i had a good relationship with um

his name escapes me. it'll come to me

jerry.

it'll it'll come to me later. he was the department head

um

who helped me get into grad school as it turns out.

okay. and questions about your games.

first of all, if defender was graphic intensive, one of the innovations of alto

as i remember

it was bit blit.

and i wonder if bitblit was something that was which you used

or that you knew about in terms of its graphics capabilities.

um, i knew about biplit and bitlit was important for the games,

but defender had a unique

a unique sort of challenge,

which is it drew a landscape in real time at the bottom of the screen that was basically random.

no, not random,

but it was

it was like a squiggly line.

okay, it wasn't just a line from one point to another.

it was thousands of points.

yeah.

okay.

and it had to be drawn in real time.

and bipllet was useless for that. and so i had to code that by hand. there was

i coded one instruction which would draw the landscape

and another instruction which would erase the landscape.

and so as fast as it could, basically 60 times a second, it would erase and redraw.

er, erase and redraw and try and get display sync just right. yeah. there was

that was the only way to do it. and did did these um games

uh

give you a reputation? was there already a community of people who would, you know,

value

i never thought about that at the time,

but probably

um

there weren't a lot of things like that for the alto, right?

and i do know these games spread to the other of the other sites

that

as everything did

everything good that got got spread out.

so it did spread to other elto sites.

um, i can't say that i can look back

and say that caused me to meet more people or whatever.

um,

i just i just don't know.

yeah.

okay.

and

um,

so were you always

at this point

you

were

you were always

so i'm just wondering about high level languages and what the gestalt was

or the sort of at rochester at that point. was it a pascal world?

what was the sort of this high level language that was fashionable

and did you have to spend time with it? so

from an academic perspective, teaching the masses of undergrads was pascal. they offered some more advanced classes

um

where you could do more. you could learn more languages

and in particular

i remember there was a language class

part of which

well

i think there was a language class

and then there was a compiler class

and in the language class we learned a lot of languages.

i remember i remember doing homework.

there was one homework where you had to write a text editor in snowball of all things.

um

so i do remember learning a lot of languages at least at a peripheral level.

yeah.

um

enough to do a text command line based text editor. yeah. back at that time. um

but when you graduated

you still graduated with a math

not an applied math degree, a math degree. i had graduated with a ba in math. math.

yes.

yeah.

and tell us about the the

the

the sort of the path from from rochester to cmu and the help that you got from the chair.

it's jerry

and his name is jerry feldman.

oh my god. okay. you know jerry feldman?

i do know.

a lot of people know jerry feldman.

so jerry was the chair of the department at the time

and i got to work with him a little bit.

he got to know me.

so if you think back to what i said about high school, i was going to be a statistician, right? well, so i'm thinking as an undergraduate in um college now, i'm a pretty good programmer.

i've done a lot of work for the faculty writing code, not not research per se,

but you know, some good work under their direction.

okay.

well, i'm going to go get a reasonably good paying job at microsoft who does all the professional software, right? so,

that was my thinking certainly at least through junior year.

um, but jerry and others said, you know, avi, you should take a look at graduate school.

they thought i'd be a good candidate for graduate school. i'm like, i'm like, what are you talking about?

it's never even occurred to me. i'm lucky to have even finished college.

this is totally cool. first person in my family. um,

but i was working with researchers now. so, i saw what they did.

and somewhere along the way,

what what i did was this this um work i've been doing on the vssi design rule checker.

i had built a um

interesting piece of technology

which would do in using the c language

which would

um

it was a

it was a dynamic

uh

mark and sweep type garbage collector

uh

to automatically manage data structures without having to write any code that no one had ever done before.

or it was kind of interesting.

i pre-processed the header files and i added to them and recompiled them

and there's all

there's all this other magic with a runtime library and could garbage collect in real time.

it was pretty cool for what it was especially for an undergrad

and i wrote a paper on it and i don't

i didn't even submit it for publication or anything

but i figured this would just be a cool thing

and and the faculty i knew was helping me with it

and and so so it's a bit of unusual research for an undergraduate to do. um

and

and so the faculty said, " look, you should at least look at a graduate program before you go off

and get a job.

" i said, " okay, i love working with you guys.

i love this research aspect of it.

why not? "

and so i said, " but i'm only going to do

that if i can go to either carnegie melon, stanford,

or mit.

" okay.

and if i can't get into one of those then, and they kind of agreed with me.

they're like, " yeah, absolutely. " and so, um, i applied to all three

and jerry wrote me letters of recommendation.

i had a research paper that i had written.

lo and behold, i got accepted at all three.

okay.

and so, i'm like, i guess destiny is that i go to grad school.

so, that's how that happened.

and how did you choose which of the three? that's a really interesting.

the way i choose these things seems strange.

i mean, you go back to the rochester thing. so, here's here's the way that works.

so, i get letters of acceptance from all three and um carnegie melon in their letter of acceptance

or maybe in a in a quick follow-up says in you know

we'd love to see

they're all saying we'd love to see you come right

because they don't accept everybody there

15

maybe a year at those places at the time. yeah.

and and they're like

come visit us

call us up. tell us when you can come down

we'll schedule you know

meetings and everything. we'll take care of everything. so i called him up and i went down.

it wasn't too far of a trip. it was easy drive down to pittsburgh and loved it. and so

um

i then

uh

tried to talk to both

like

i talked to both stanford and mit to try to do something similar. and so i called mit

uh

and they said, " oh, we don't do that.

we we expect people that we expect to come here. " yeah. i was like, " okay,

well

you turned me down once.

i'm going to have turned you down this time. " and then stanford said, " um,

yeah,

we can host you. we don't always do that. we'd love to see you come out,

but you know,

no,

we can't play pay for a plane ticket, and no, we can't give you a hotel or anything.

" i'm like, screw that.

yeah.

if i want to go to the west coast, i'll go there for a job after i graduate from carnegie melon.

yeah.

so, so carnegie melon was very good about this.

and they weren't really, i mean, they weren't the name brand school, right? so i would talk to my uncles back in maine who had heard of stanford

and mit but never heard of carnegie melon

and they're like wait a minute

especially mit

when if you're in maine

mit is like it

you've been accepted at mit and you're not going like

trust me

this is the right thing

but when i visited carnegie melon

it was just

you know

i loved it

just like i loved rochester when i went there and

and they were very welcoming and they had a

from what i could tell

a great program.

it was a great program. yeah.

go ahead. was so you applied to those three because they were the three top programs

or they were the ones that you that the faculty recommended?

those were the three top programs. yeah. yeah. yeah.

and just there are some people who said, " why didn't you apply to berkeley? "

and i said, "

because berkeley was number four.

" sorry, berkeley fans. yeah. before we leave college,

outside of computing, social life, sports,

what

what was what did you do besides compute while you were?

so, what did i do besides compute?

um, nothing of interest that i remember.

um, so,

you know,

i still had, you know,

interesting summer jobs, but that's was still around computing.

although,

when i was in as an undergrad, i would still go back

and we'd go to our summer place on the lake.

and so that was a 9-to-f5 computing job.

you left it there because there was no way to commute compute remotely and everybody left at 5.

the place was shut down

and then i i'd come back to the lake

and go water skiing with my brothers or boating or whatever.

and we go dirt bike riding or you all those kinds of things, but there wasn't that much else.

yeah. yeah.

um

before we go into the the cmu section, um

could you tell us more about the the other research projects that you were working on at rochester

and some of the other programs that you wrote?

so the

the

the

the two research projects i remember at rochester were the vlsi design tool and the computer vision work.

i don't even remember the details of the computer vision work.

those are the only ones that i really remember

and frankly those are probably the two major ones that i did.

if there was anything else, i don't really remember what it was.

and then everything else was all my personal programming projects.

and and i always took some kind of computer science class every semester. there was all

there was plenty that were offered. i took them all. um

but probably the most time was spent on my own projects.

and then the big ones i think were definitely missile command and defender. those took a lot of time.

oh, go ahead.

and the lsi design,

was that because rochester had that connection to xerox?

was that coming straight out of xerox park?

um,

we had someone on faculty whose area was vssi design

and um

i don't know why we did,

but we had a diverse set of faculty.

did conway and meat exist by that time? that that text about blsi designer?

i think so.

i think so.

yeah.

but that was a graduate level text probably not for you know

i remember taking a vlsi undergraduate class where we did

we built a basic circuit

sent it out for fab.

oh, so that was

but it was

it was

it was very basic. yeah.

and i think as i recollect

that helped me a little bit to at least understand what i was working on on the design rule checker.

yeah.

yeah.

and while you were there, did the ibm pc emerge and did

did there become a culture of the ibm pc style computing, doss,

did that all happen while you were an undergraduate?

um,

jamie,

we can look at the calendar. yeah, it would have happened when i was an undergraduate

just based on the calendar,

but it never i was always doing much more interesting things. i mean, programming on a vax

was way more interesting

and programming on elto

was way more interesting yet again.

so why would you ever use an ibm computer?

and if i wanted to do anything, i could always go use the apple 2

or the the commodore pet,

which in many respects was even more interesting than ibm.

and did computing ever did

were you in

did you live in a dormatory the entire time you were at school

or did you move off campus

or so

uh

it was different every year. so my freshman year i was in the dorm.

sophomore year, i was in an off-campus school-managed uh

two-bedroom apartment with a friend.

junior year, i was back on campus in a suite with five friends.

and then senior year, i was in an off-campus uh apartment with a couple of friends

that was on the school shuttle. yeah. yeah.

and and did com

did you ever have a not home computer

but a computer that you know that was not a work computer. so, so did you

what did did that transition happen while you were in school? like in your dorm room

or in your

so, the first computer i had that was not that was like in my room was probably

i think about this for a second.

that was probably when i bought a mac for myself at carnegie melon in 1984.

yeah.

so, the mac happened after you left.

yeah, i was at carnegie melon. yeah.

was it a big deal to buy a mac at that point? oh yeah.

$ 2, 400

or whatever it was.

it was like it was a commitment student discount. that's right.

and did so you were around when you know the the mac team was on their tour.

did do you remember the mac did?

like

did steve come through while you were a graduate student?

um

if he did on a mac tour, i don't remember it. yeah.

do you remember the 3m machine? the concept of a dream. absolutely.

yeah.

absolutely.

yeah.

but it was bubbling while you were a graduate student, didn't it? or maybe it was too early.

when did it start? 85.

well, so you know,

i mean, different people have different views of when the first 3m machine was, but like the um

the um

uh

the perk

um

what was the name of the company?

uh

perk

systems or something like that. yeah, it was.

uh

yeah,

perk.

they sort of had one of the first 3m machines

which

of course that was a carnegie melon spin out and it was moused driven.

i remember it was mouse driven. yeah.

yeah.

it was a forgotten perk entirely.

so tell us about coming to carnegie melon entering the program and what what it was like. yeah.

so

um

very different than being an undergrad. um

i was almost like a kid in a candy store. i mean they had everything.

they had altos

of course. they had the ibm machines

which i could care less about.

they had a deck 20

which was super hot, right? and i mean hot in temperature

was hot in temperature

but super hot as a computer, right? and and i could get on that if i wanted to.

uh

they had perks all over the place.

# Chapter 5

they sort of had one of the first 3m machines

which

of course that was a carnegie melon spin out and it was moused driven.

i remember it was mouse driven. yeah.

yeah.

it was a forgotten perk entirely.

so tell us about coming to carnegie melon entering the program and what what it was like. yeah.

so

um

very different than being an undergrad. um

i was almost like a kid in a candy store. i mean they had everything.

they had altos

of course. they had the ibm machines

which i could care less about.

they had a deck 20

which was super hot, right? and i mean hot in temperature

was hot in temperature

but super hot as a computer, right? and and i could get on that if i wanted to.

uh

they had perks all over the place.

um

which was totally cool

cuz not only was it like an elto in the lab, but you could actually get a perk in your office

which was

i mean that was really cool. yeah.

um

so

from that perspective i was like a kid in a candy store. um

it was also different in that there were some academic requirements

but they were very minimal

you know

minimal theory class

minimal

i probably took four classes the whole time there

it was

it

was

this is one of the things i liked about it.

it was applied research.

everybody there, almost everybody was doing things

that was tangible

that you could see was going to have some real impact in three to five to 10 years.

so what was the process of pairing up with the project or the faculty

or you know

so

was it a

was it a recruiting scene

or did you volunteer? how did you find your way to the

to the project you you ended up

and

was it more than one?

you know, i don't know the way it exactly happened, but i think there was,

first of all,

i think rick may have sponsored my visit to go to go see the place

because they knew there was a connection there with him being a rochester grad

and i think i'd expressed some interest in os level stuff by then.

i'd certainly taken some os classes by then. um,

and so i don't know that they assigned us together.

they probably didn't.

um

other than maybe an informal temporary adviser, but we were sort of naturally drawn together

because his area of expertise and research was

um

oss and he was working on the perk systems

with the accent

operating system

and operating systems were an area of interest to me and we had the connection with rochester.

so he became my adviser.

um

and most other students who took on rick as an adviser

who or he took on as a student

um

prior to me

would go work on some aspect of accent

and there were plenty of things plenty of research to do there.

and i looked at that

i said i don't want to do that and um

i wanted to do something new

and accent was fairly mature. it was they were selling it

um through perk and i wanted to do something completely new

and i think it was

rick told me

he said

you know

we've got this other thing that we're looking at getting a darpa grant for

um

why don't you take a look at that

either he told me that

or someone else told me that

or i somehow i discovered that

and i looked into it

and it was this project to build um parallel computing

if you will.

it had been done a little bit at the time

but not really

and they wanted to do

they were

they were putting in a grant for it

and so i decided i wanted to do that

and so that was a clean slate project

which i could basically start with rick from scratch

and he was very supportive

and

and that's how it all started. yeah.

and what

when you so

parallel computing was on the horizon

what were the hot

risk was a very hot topic there

but that was probably more architectural

like in the software world

what else was there was

i think risk came a little bit after

just a little bit after that

soon after that

though

um

robotics was starting to get hot

not like it is today

right

very different levels

there was a lot of going on in theory

ai was very hot

okay

um

ai was sort of one of the newer things.

people didn't know it didn't work then.

at least they couldn't get it to work then with the resources they had then.

but they really were trying to make it work. that was a big one. yeah.

um

there was still stuff going on in computer vision. there was stuff going on with

uh

uh

transaction technologies, database and transactions.

um

those are the ones that i remember off top of my head.

wasn't there a file system project at that was later

file systems came a little bit later.

okay.

yeah.

and so you know there was a community of people.

were there other faculty who you know were sort of alternative universe ways for you to go that

you know

paths not taken because there was

there

was

there

was

well,

i'm sure there was

but i never really considered them. um

i mean i could have gone to work for a on ai.

i mean, carnegie melon was really leading that

then

with some of the people that were there or robotics. they were leading a lot of the robotic

they had a whole separate robotics area

and um

you know

maybe robotics could have interested me a little bit because i like doing that kind of stuff

but some

it just didn't

it didn't click.

i just i think rick and i hit it off hit it off pretty well

and i just love this.

it was a ground floor thing that no one was working on at all.

it was a whole new project

which got me really excited too. did do you remember the name red whitaker?

he was the hot roboticist when you were there.

you didn't end up doing anything with him. i remember the name. that's about it.

yeah.

um

and there was

you're right.

the ai project stuff they had there was formidable. i mean it was simon alen newell.

yeah. they were the guys.

they were the guys. they were all there doing that. yeah.

so

um

the challenge

talk about getting into parallel computing and the challenges of

i mean

did you

i mean

i remember that time as parallelization was not working very well

i mean there were people didn't think parallel

there were all kinds of sort of threads

but it wasn't really

things were not parallelized that

at that point in the world

well

as far as i was concerned

and sometimes i have tunnel vision

this may have been one of the times

as far as i was concerned

we were the first ones doing

and we're

it was an unsolved problem and we were going to make it work.

okay. and it wasn't really going to be

i never thought of it as a hard problem. it's like oh

you've got

instead of one computer

you've got four.

you just got to coordinate things, right? and people knew some of the basic things like semaphors.

those were known concepts, right? and so to me it was like okay

we just got to do some hard work. um

so we got the grant. um

digital

uh

had been tapped to build the computer.

they were going to take a 780

and turn into a 784, which was four 780s all hooked in with an inter interconnected shared memory to turn into a 784,

which i love.

i love the 780.

i get to use four of them.

this is totally cool and it's all mine.

um, i get to build the os for it.

no one's there's no os for it.

that was just beautiful.

and as part of that, they had just come out with the microvax.

they gave me a microvax which i got to put in my office.

i had like the best computer in anyone's office in the whole school.

um,

and it was interesting. i got because i got to write

write the os for it. yeah.

and it was not so your

the sort of the

the architectural direction was not parallelizing unix. it was much more fundamental than that.

um, i want to say yes,

but it's not that simple. there was a very fundamental aspect of it

which was to start with

what are the concepts we need to build a parallel

an an os for a par parallel computer

and so from that perspective

we did look at important subsystems

that hadn't really been done in a way that we thought needed to be done

excuse me at the os level for threading

scheduling

virtual memory

management

some things like that

um

but as we got into it very early on

um

mostly

i think

at rick's urging

we also integrated unix

and the reason for that was building an os that's useful is hard

right

there are many many different layers that you need to build

and what we figured was there were a bunch of layers

that we didn't care about some of these issues that we wanted to have access to

like you

remember the programs a and said and grep

y

we just want those right

we don't want to build those from scratch for a parallel word

we just want them

and

uh

so we figured we could leverage unix

which was getting pretty popular in colleges

um

not only to get those things but to also have a way to get others to use our research

and so we pursued this strategy of building a whole new core os

which was mock

and then the mock kernel

and then grafting onto it

bsd unix.

the whole thing people generally refer to as mock.

now it occurs to me to ask

i

um

maybe i know

the answer is

where did the name mach come from?

how did you come to name this the project?

okay.

um

it's one of the things i remember. um

so there are a bunch of us working on the project. um

and it didn't have a name.

and one of the things about rochester is it rained a lot

or i mean um

pittsburgh is it rained a lot. um

and a bunch of us would go to lunch over at pit

which was right next door to carnegie melon.

there were lots of good restaurants there. so we go to lunch over at pit almost every day

and and so rick and me and a couple of the grad students

maybe a couple of the faculty members were were trying to figure out what name we should pick for this thing.

and the best we had come up with is

um

um

i can't remember what

the best we came up with,

but we're all walking along

and we're trying to find acronyms that have multiprocessor in them and computing in them

and things like that. and we're

we're failing.

and as we're walking over one of the bridges, we huge puddles of mud everywhere.

and we're like walking, look at all this muck. and someone said, " muk,

that should be the name,

right? multi-user communicating kernel,

something like that. and we're all just joking about it.

and so we get back after lunch

and we're joking with one of the other faculty members who i believe was italian.

and we're like, " the best we've come up with so far is muk.

" and he heard it as mock.

he's a great name, mock.

and so it stuck.

there was no star wars. i mean, star trek.

uh, no.

that's why i guess it's

i thought that was the answer.

no.

so, so

um

did the idea of the micro kernel exist at that point

or did

where were you guys in the sort of architectural approach

that that was based on separating things in that way? i i think the answer to that is yes,

if only because accent had already had an architecture sort of like that. um,

and i don't remember if it was a similar time frame, but there there was other work going on.

i think there's some work at stanford going on or should would go on soon with the v kernel.

um,

and there may have been other work going on a little bit later.

it so it wasn't brand new, but it wasn't old either.

right. right. and were you thinking i'm trying to remember

at a certain point

parallel languages began to emerge. the one i'm thinking of right now is linda,

but i think that was maybe in the late 80s. were you ahead of all the parallel?

were there any parallel languages to to design to?

as far as i can recall,

we were ahead of the parallel languages.

and again, we were

we were operating at a level below that anyway.

yeah.

and if anything,

we were trying to provide something that people doing parallel language development could take use of. yeah. yeah.

um

and and um

okay,

i guess one of the things we wanted to ask for is sort of a a definition for a general audience of what a micro kernel is

or how you thought about separating function in the in design.

the the simplest way to describe how i think about the separation is you have only the minimal functionality

that you require in the kernel

in the kernel.

everything else is out.

and so what that basically means is the basic functions to control the computer itself. um

which is resource management for the protected resources

um

the scheduling of the resources

which is both scheduling of processors and scheduling of memory

which is the virtual memory part.

and that's it from a conceptual perspective.

now then reality sets in, right? and you look at things from a performance perspective.

and so there's all these things

that are now conceptually outside of the micro kernel, file system, networking, even device drivers

that have logic in them.

um, but what you do is you colllocate them with the kernel for performance reasons

and that's what exists today.

okay. yeah.

did

i don't know if we we had talked about this at lunch and the performance issue in particular.

did did you have

oh, i was actually i was just going to ask sort of what

what was mach's major advance over accent?

so, accent had focused on what i would say

is two

two

one idea

that's almost the same thing

or two things

that almost one idea

message passing and virtual memory.

m

and so accented message passing in a certain style

that allowed you to decompose problems into multiple processes that communicate each with each other

and also introduced this notion of what's called copy and write

virtual memory

where you can send

you can send

um

this is important when you

when you have things

sharing two processes sharing a lot of data but don't actually have to use it all.

you could send like 10 megabytes of data in one message without actually sending it

and it goes copy on write.

so it only actually copies when the other process writes it.

and so that and the message passing and they

they kind of go hand in hand.

and we actually did a paper about the duality of virtual memory and message passing at one point. um

that was sort of one of the key things behind accent other than powering a 3m machine. um

and so we kept that paradigm

but the newer things that we added were the notion of the scheduling of multiple processors

and how you do that

and we learned a lot over the years on how to do that efficiently

based on different architectures

um

and how do you do a virtual memory system

that supports this copy on write notion in a multipprocessor system

which is much more difficult than a non multipprocessor system. um

and

and

and then we also did some work with more formalizing the notion of having services

that aren't in the kernel itself

even though for optimization reasons they are. those are the the big things. it

you know

in the grand scheme of things

it doesn't seem like a lot

but it's pretty profound stuff and important stuff. mhm.

and also to to follow up on sort of this the performance issue. um

so mach 2.

5 was sort of a hybrid micro kernel. so with some things were still in kernel space,

not everything was in user space

and then mach 3 tried to move everything into user space. um

but then you mentioned that

you know

# Chapter 6

um

and how do you do a virtual memory system

that supports this copy on write notion in a multipprocessor system

which is much more difficult than a non multipprocessor system. um

and

and

and then we also did some work with more formalizing the notion of having services

that aren't in the kernel itself

even though for optimization reasons they are. those are the the big things. it

you know

in the grand scheme of things

it doesn't seem like a lot

but it's pretty profound stuff and important stuff. mhm.

and also to to follow up on sort of this the performance issue. um

so mach 2.

5 was sort of a hybrid micro kernel. so with some things were still in kernel space,

not everything was in user space

and then mach 3 tried to move everything into user space. um

but then you mentioned that

you know

later on

um

things kind of move back towards the hybrid model. um

yeah

so that's a good memory of the version numbers

i wouldn't have remembered that until you mentioned it.

so 2. 5

up until 2. 5

um

we had built everything into a monolithic kernel for performance reasons

and then the 3. 0 effort was an effort

which i think actually that happened after i left carnegie melon and was done in part by osf.

uh

that was an effort to formally have a micro kernel and have services outside.

to me that was more of just a research effort

and i don't know that that codebase ever made it into any product anywhere. yeah. okay.

tell us about the creating the team.

how big was the team and what your role was in the mock

the mock group. um

okay.

so you know that's one of those areas where my recollection differs from other people

because i know people have told me what they thought the team was and how it worked

and um

so this is your oral history. this is my oral history and i'll

i'll annotate it with what others have told me that that may that seem plausible. um

so i started the team being the first person on the project because i wanted something new

and rick suggested because we had this grant potential. um

and of course rick was involved as my adviser. um

but initially he was still mostly involved with accent

and then as other students started coming in

they started just joining the team.

but i think initially i was probably spending a little bit of my time on some of the classes i had to get done

and just kind of poking around on this

and doing a little bit of investigative work such

that we could get the grant to have the money um

and working with deck on getting the actual hardware things like that.

i know i was working on the microvax

doing a lot of prototyping before we even had a 78 784.

um,

so we had a few other students join the project. um,

i think

just because they thought it was interesting.

um,

being the person that started it, i sort of controlled the codebase.

now, i've been told i was a benevolent dictator

when it came to controlling the codebase

and would send pe things back saying it wasn't good enough or all kinds of evil things like that.

i have no recollection of that, so i can neither confirm nor deny.

um

it's partially believable. um

but you know

a few years in we had the

the project was getting large and a few years in we were hiring research staff

not even students to work on it to do a lot of things.

it was turning into a big project and i don't know the numbers. it's too long ago

but you know

we quickly had probably a dozen people on it

and then

um

we started deploying it internally to the department

where we had people in the department using the software. yeah.

and and do you remember what part of

so money came from darpa the first year you were around? you you got

you were up and running as a funded project pretty quickly.

i don't know that the money came in the first year.

i don't remember when it came in, but it came in relatively early. and from ipo,

do you remember what part of darpa

by any chance? i do not remember which part of darpa it came in from

or the was there a program manager who showed up

or it was

you just had money.

i remember we went to a meeting where there were arpa people there.

there may have been some military people there as well,

maybe even someone in a uniform,

but i it was too long. i don't remember remember the details of it. so

um

the thing about mock is it got

you know

i i out on the west coast as a bite editor

i knew about mock mach sort of established itself as a sort of

you know

future of computing kind of idea early on.

do you know

have any idea how that happened

how it sort of got out into the broader world?

so couple reasons.

the first reason is because we adopted bsd unix as our interface

and everybody wanted to use bsd unix already

at least in academia and we had a better bsd unix

because we took out some of the looked at people

we took out some of the pieces of bsd unix they didn't like

and put in parts that they now liked.

uh

and that's true even today.

if you use freebsd, it's basically the version that we did. we grafted mock stuff into it. um,

and so it was

it was easy for people to use it.

it was, you know, they could use a set and graph. it all worked just like they're used to.

and the other thing that we did was we wrote research papers

and went to eustix conferences and other conferences and talked about it.

um,

and not only did we talk about it in a research paper, we said, " and oh

by the way,

here's where you can get a copy of it.

" and everybody else with a research paper had the research paper

and oh by the way

that's all we have.

so that was a pretty big difference and it gets back to the whole carnegie melon at that time

doing everything was very applied.

you know we thought we were failing if we weren't doing something

that other people could actually not just read about but use.

yes.

that's an interesting culture. yeah. um

so maybe

um

we're about an hour and a half in

so

maybe one last question and then we could take a little break. does that does that

um

so your view of the significance and the legacy of mark?

i mean so sort of take it the next step

and how did it change the world? well

boy

that's a complicated question. um

i think it changed the world in this

this is

you know

lots of unintended consequences

perhaps in a good way

which is

it's not even about the technology

it's about the relationships that came.

so, you know,

as we were presenting at usnix one time, steve jobs sent some next employee, some next employees,

and they loved what they heard and they found they could play with it, and they did.

and so they called us up and said, " we want to make this part of the next computer.

" so that would have been circa 86

87

86 86 87

right after they formed next.

yeah.

so really i don't remember which conference they saw us at precisely, but they told us in'87. yeah.

and then you know

so

then that caused me and steve to have a great relationship.

we did everything with next that led to apple

and i mean the rest is all history.

so i mean it's almost a non-technical story in that regard.

so clearly

i mean we'll get to that

but there is that thread going into next and apple.

um

did rick take stuff of mock philosophy

and architecture into microsoft? did it also have an impact in that direction? i don't think so.

i think it went more the the directions it went in obviously were the next direction.

there was the osf direction

which was pretty significant.

there was the bsd direction where they took a little piece of it and then it kind of stagnated.

those were probably the primary directions.

there were other companies that used the osf version a little bit.

never never in any kind of meaningful volumes. um

and i think what rick took to microsoft was more his research philosophy just in general.

and he wasn't even necessarily doing os research. he was doing research. yeah. okay. so then um

in terms of the micro kernel, so so all the the major oss that use the mock

or a version of the micro kernel still use the hybrid model that you developed

and and not sort of the

the whole theoretical absolute separation between um

user

user space and kernel space programs.

at least practically like

practically

it's not performant

enough

right

so

as far as i know

today

the only commercial uses are what apple has today

which is still what i would call the monolithic kernel

although it is partitioned a little bit

um

and then the other example would be like freebsd a little bit

um

but i'm not really aware of anything that uses the mach 3. 0

i know a pure micro kernel structure today. interesting.

okay.

i think that was more just a research project that proved it could be done

and today people opt for performance.

yeah.

if i could just ask one quick question to make sure that i'm understanding the story correctly.

it it seems like at first the mock project was very tied to this new kind of experimental machine,

you know,

this ganging the four computers together with the shared memory.

but then it sounds like very quickly

uh

the operating system becomes

uh

not particularly tuned to that parallel experimental machine

but could be used much

uh

more widely.

is that correct?

did it lose its particularity

or?

so that is a really good point.

okay.

and let me clarify.

so initially the project was targeting the va 784.

this cluster of four 780s. but before they could build that, they sent me a microvax

which was just a vax.

it was a 780 with a small one. little desk. it was, you know, not a desktop

but it was small.

and so i started programing.

it had only had one processor in it.

so i started building an os for one where for you know

n processors where n equal one

okay

um

and did work on the 784

later on

worked on other multipprocessors

and what we discovered was that what we quickly discovered

and this was a problem for bsd at the time

um was

bsd wasn't portable

and so we built something that was portable and so other companies were using other instruction sets

so, um, encore was using the mips instruction set.

i believe sequent was using maybe the intel instruction set. i can't

i can't remember exactly. um,

ibm wanted to do things with the rt,

which was the was that the uh pa risk instruction? no.

yeah,

it was pa risk. yeah.

no, that was hp.

no, no,

pa risk was was hp.

what was the ibm risk? a trivia power. power. power. yeah. power.

um

and so so we started building a portable os

in addition to a multipprocessor os

and and um

i remember

in really early days

i i was thinking

you know

i'm a graduate student

been there a couple years

i'm thinking where are all the places we can take this quote

unquote micro kernel

where we're not going to need all of this heavy functionality that you see in an os today

and i'm thinking like maybe someday we can put this in a refrigerator

okay

this is back in

you know

mid 80s

right. and i'm thinking to myself, okay,

is this interesting enough if we can sell it for 50 cents a unit?

right? thinking, nah,

never going to sell that many copies. but but that was the thinking back then. you know,

we were tuned for the 784 initially. um,

but we knew we were building something beyond that.

we were porting to these other systems. was reporting to the rt

that was a single processor system but had an inverted page table which no one had ever seen before.

um

but our vm architecture made it easy to support.

you know we ran on encores,

we ran on sequence,

we discovered they had different memory architectures where they were,

you know,

20

30 processors in them

and you had to know where the caches were to make things efficient.

so we were doing all of the above at that point in time

and

and we didn't just focus on the one thing

and maybe this is in part why we had so many people that started to work on it.

yeah, that was the era of mini supers,

wasn't it? did you become sort of the the

the

the

i mean they they needed

they

were

they were all parallel kinds of machines and did they all pick up

uh

mock?

i

you know

i think they all had projects with us going on. they all

they generally ship their own os

okay

to their customers

but they're all working with us and they would have people porting

i don't know that any of them

i'm some of them probably went commercial with it

but i'm not really sure yeah

which ones or if there were any meaningful volumes

but a lot was learned in those years. yeah.

um

can we start tell us a little bit about your dissertation

what you focused on and where

okay

let me remember

oh

yes

okay

long time ago. so for my dissertation, i remember

my plan was to do a dissertation on mock.

seemed to make perfect sense to me. rick said, " no, you can't do that.

that's way too broad. " but, you know, i i was one that was happy being broad. right.

um,

so i said, " no, you got to focus more.

" so, so what i did was i focused on the virtual memory system of of the os

and i focused on

um

what we had done was we had built the first both portable and parallel virtual memory system.

so that was the focus.

yeah. okay.

and how does that work? did in terms of when you left and when you got your dissertation

did you get your dissertation before you decamped

or did it come after you were at

well

um

you mean the chronology related to when i left carnegie melon.

so you have to have your dissertation done before you can leave.

okay.

and so the order of events was

um

you pick your topic

of course

well

in advance of this

and then you do the research specific to it

then you write it up.

it's a massive document

and then you defend it with your thesis committee and then there's more work to do.

they say

great,

good job.

now make these changes. takes you a few months.

you do those tweaks

and you're done.

yeah.

besides rick, was there anybody else of note or you a member on your committee?

yes.

um,

so rick was on my committee,

al spectre was on my committee, uh,

al was a another faculty member, and dennis richie was on my committee.

okay, that's gold standard. that's good. yeah. um

and and then there's a question here, but maybe in the sort of flip it. um

you're

you continued to to work on big systems.

there was this massive explosion of the personal computing world in the first half of the 80s, but i i get the sense aside from you having a macintosh

that you were in a different world.

you remained sort of in a high performance computing world as opposed to the pc world while you were in graduate school

or i

i

from a research perspective, i think that's fair.

um,

remember

i did have the microvax.

yeah.

which was

it wasn't as low-end as the macintosh, but it was a personal

it was essentially a personal computer, the personal workstation. yeah.

um,

you know,

it's hard to say why we didn't focus on even the lower level

more personal computer type stuff. um

there

may

maybe the hardware wasn't quite ready for what we were trying to do is one of the answers.

yeah. yeah.

but i'm not 100 % sure about that.

yeah.

and then one one more question.

um

so while you were there,

you know, a generation earlier,

# Chapter 7

remember

i did have the microvax.

yeah.

which was

it wasn't as low-end as the macintosh, but it was a personal

it was essentially a personal computer, the personal workstation. yeah.

um,

you know,

it's hard to say why we didn't focus on even the lower level

more personal computer type stuff. um

there

may

maybe the hardware wasn't quite ready for what we were trying to do is one of the answers.

yeah. yeah.

but i'm not 100 % sure about that.

yeah.

and then one one more question.

um

so while you were there,

you know, a generation earlier,

darpa used to have these annual meetings at snowbird in which they'd have the faculty who were the researchers

and then the students would come too

and it really was a community building exercise.

had those stopped

by the time you were in on a darpa track? well, if they hadn't, i never got invited to snowbird.

maybe rick went. um, so i don't know.

i do remember going to darpa meetings in washington. yeah.

um,

to talk about what we were doing every once in a while.

okay. go ahead. one question also.

um, so why did you decide to get a macintosh rather than, you know, an ibm clone? was it

because of the alto?

and how did you like the mac compared to your alto or compared to your experiences with the alto?

so, that's a good question.

let me think about why that might have been the case.

um, i think it's simply that the the macintosh was i mean, we talked about the 3m machine before

and the macintosh was sort of in the vein of the 3m machine

and the pc was not.

and so this was now a 3m machine that with a student discount i could afford. um

and so it seemed to make sense to buy it.

and while you were doing this research on on on were you a aware of the other projects

that were going on at other campuses of the time.

mips x had started up at um stanford.

um

there was um

sun originally started with bealign and um basket at at stanford.

were those on your radar at all before they got out into the commercial world? um

i don't know that those were on our radar screen before they became commercial that much. we

were

you know

we were being funded to use the deck stuff. other people who were doing things like ibm

for example

were coming in and showing us their stuff with the rt.

um

i don't recall which of the others had come in. some of them may or may not.

we

were

we were definitely getting a lot more interest

and focusing more on the the bigger guys, the encore as a sequence with the bigger iron.

and then i was thinking west coast

and then there were

also

so you were you

you had perk right there

and then what was the name of the sun competitor in in uh

in cambridge that i'm forget in boston. apollo did

did they have much contact with with

uh

you guys?

no

i don't

i mean we were aware of apollo

um

but we never interacted with them. you know i'm trying to think.

we probably had a meeting or two with them.

i remember visiting their place maybe once. yeah.

um,

but nothing really happened all that much.

was data general still alive at that time? i'm trying to remember when they got in trouble.

i think they were irrelevant if they were alive. yeah. yeah. yeah.

um,

go ahead. were the the mac ports of miss soul command and defender

fairly straightforward and just something fun that you did at home? uh,

the mac ports of those games were mostly fun. um,

the mac,

the mac had reasonable computing power compared to the elto,

except when you program the elto microode,

that was hard to be comparable to the mac.

so, um, the ports were relatively straightforward, but i couldn't get around using the os. and uh

i remember

the one big problem i had was i wanted to have sound effects and music in the games. um

and in the mac

in those days when you turned on the uh sound processor

it consumed like 50 % or more of the cycles of the computer.

wow.

and so that put me over the edge where the games didn't work.

so, i had to override the mac sound driver with my own and then i got it to work.

were these freeware projects? i can't

i can't remember.

um, i had visions of selling both the mac and defender games. and in fact, you know,

this was sort of the beginnings of people selling software.

and i had a contract with a company in la that was a software publisher. um,

and they asked me to put some copy protection in, which basically read bad sectors on the disc.

uh,

and then they were going to ship it.

and for some, i think they went out of business before they shipped it. something something like that.

so, i gave it away as freeear.

um,

uh,

i had a little message. if you like this, send a check to whatever.

a few checks came in. i think i got

i think i almost paid for the mac. maybe not quite.

not quite.

oh, that's that's they come in, you know,

$ 5, $ 10 at a time. yeah.

but it didn't seduce you into an open source

i mean a a a program cottage programming lifestyle. shareware. shareware.

yeah. no.

no.

yeah.

so now here you are at your next juncture.

um

what was your thought process while you were sort of in the second half of your graduate student career about what you would do after after graduate school? okay.

so let's set the stage.

i'm a happy camper, happy graduate student at carnegie melon, loving what i'm doing. uh,

i mean, i've got all these computers to myself because i'm writing the os.

no one else can use them.

um,

i've got control over this os.

people come to me to check in things and whatever.

they look to me for advice on what to do. and we're getting, you know,

people are following what we're doing.

lots of companies want to use our stuff.

and i'm just having a grand old time.

and i'm almost falling into the trap of what happened to a lot of carnegie melon grad students, which is they can take six, seven, eight years to graduate.

um, and so i'm probably, let's see, it's probably 90 87 now.

so, i'm in my fourth year

and rick and i come out to the west coast for a meeting at berkeley

because we're it's berkeley unix conference

and we find out that steve jobs wants to meet with us on our trip.

um, this is probably this might be 86 actually.

um, so we we come in, we fly in my first time ever to san francisco.

fly into san francisco. rick and i are staying in a not so good hotel just off the airport.

um,

and we're

we're going to meet steve for dinner.

so, we go over to the next offices on deer creek road

and we're sitting down in the lobby waiting for steve

and

um,

so steve comes down all excited. hi guys, how you doing? and shake up

shake

shake his hand. oh, i've met you before. that's what he says to me. like, i don't

no,

you haven't met me before. yeah,

i've met you before.

like, no, you haven't met me before.

i'm like, " steve, you know, i'd know if we'd met before.

" he's like, " no, i know we've met before. " and like, " whatever.

" so, we go have dinner with some of his team

and they tell us, you know, we we had no re,

we had no understanding why they wanted to meet with us other

than we knew they were building a computer for education.

um,

and we thought they might be interested in what we're doing a little bit

and want to learn about what we're doing.

and he's like, " well, we want to put your os on our computer.

" i'm like, " what? really? are you kidding? so, he then leaves

and we still have more dinner with the other guys

and then we go off to our meeting at berkeley

and i'm thinking, " oh my god, i better finish up

because these guys want to use this stuff.

they're going to fail. i'm going to have to help them. " um,

etc.,

etc., etc.

and it's like the corporate world now needs me is the way i'm thinking.

so, i get things in order. i finish up the dissertation. and i have my

my

uh

my defense thesis defense with rick and al and dennis

and i start interviewing in the meantime

and

uh

and so you know

one thing kind of led to the other and ended up going to work for next.

when did rick go to to microsoft a little? uh

that was several years after i

oh,

he stayed.

oh, i see.

yeah,

he was at carnegie melon for several more years. did they try to recruit him as well as you?

um

rick expressed no interest in a corporate job.

i think they wanted to hire him as a consultant but he wanted to stay independent.

okay. and do you remember who in in the first dinner

um

do you remember who uh was like was like bud?

um

bud was there and was doing software at that at that point

in terms of bud was doing software.

yeah.

bud was doing software. bud was there

and i'm not sure who the other guys were that were there.

i mean, i could guess, but i'd probably be 50 % chance of being right in terms of who was actually there.

yeah. was like, did when did joanna show up on your radar? i don't think i ever met joanna.

really? if i did, i don't remember. was she was she gone by the time? i think so.

wow. wow. by the time you came.

yeah. i never met her that i know of.

but she was there.

wasn't she there in the early days? i don't know.

i don't think so.

am i? maybe in the very early days.

i think there some of the those retreats she shows up on those videos.

okay.

yeah. yeah. that all predated me. yeah. i may be confusing things. i got there in'88. yeah. okay. yeah.

um

was was michael holly still around? mike

yeah, mike was there.

yeah. well, he was kind of in and out. he was always in and out. yeah.

um

and were there other companies on your radar? yeah.

so,

um

obviously they're saying next is saying they want to use ros.

so obviously they're going to offer me a job if i want it, right? but i knew i had to do a little more diligence.

um

so i interviewed with microsoft, i interviewed with sun

and i think that's about it.

um

if there were other interviews, they might have just been phone calls from people who knew i was looking for a job.

and like i think apple tried to contact me, but i wasn't interested in interviewing there. yeah.

um

so those were the the three places that i considered. son was

um

kind of confused. i mean, i knew some of the people there

like,

you know,

james gosling was there.

we talked

and stuff like

that, but they never kind of got their act together about what they wanted me to do

or anything.

um

microsoft was very organized. they wanted to hire me. um

and nex wanted to hire me.

so, i had to decide between those two.

and if you'd gone to microsoft, would it have been

where was nt at

that point? had nt emerged in the world already? if i had gone to microsoft, nt probably would not have existed.

or would have been something different. interesting.

yeah,

because they basically hired cutler instead when i didn't go there. cutler came after i interviewed there. interesting.

and and you know,

my view of microsoft was

um

it was

it was interesting. um

you know,

it was

i had a great time talking with bill gates about technology and stuff. he was really into that

and it was non-traditional interview

where he he just wanted to know the work that i had done and the design decisions

and he was giving his inputs and stuff like that. um,

which i found very refreshing. um, i talked to steve balmer

who was a little more, you know, salesy,

right? didn't really know what i did.

just knew that other people thought they should hire me. and then i talked to

i talked to nathan

nathan mirvald who had all these visions of what was going to happen.

and i i talked to people who worked on doss

and i talked to people on os2.

and one of the things

that i learned as part of the interview process was there were kind of some waring factions

and wasn't clear if they were really committed to os2.

wasn't clear if they wanted me to go fix os2 or do something different.

a lot of these things going on and and it didn't quite gel with me.

so was this before ulen had showed up there too? was

i can't remember whether i don't remember. yeah. i don't remember.

so, it just it didn't feel

i mean next had a clear sort of path to putting your software out into the world.

was that kind of the the

the sort of if you had to

when you came down to making a decision? why i made the decision? couple things.

one is, you know, this was a chance from the technology perspective to take what i had worked on

and make it successful.

and it wasn't clear to me that that was going to be possible at microsoft.

at microsoft, it's more you're a good os guy, come help us to build oss.

okay, maybe something new or fix os2 or whatever kind of tbd.

um

there was the classic big company versus startup.

you know, it's like microsoft was a let's say one or two billion dollar market cap company.

then how big could it possibly get, right? who knew?

um

whereas next was a startup, right? it's gonna

it's going to grow from where it is. no, no question.

um

and then,

you know,

i really enjoyed both bill and steve and interviewing with them, but they were very different kinds of people.

and um

at the time

i kind of was more excited to work with someone like steve

because he had not only the technology passion but also you could see he's thinking about how to drive things into markets

and and stuff like that.

um

whereas

i love the conversation with bill

but there was very little about the markets and that and that kind of stuff.

not that it's bad.

i mean that's who he was.

yeah.

um

and and but you know of all those factors

i mean the fact that they were using my technology really made a big difference. yeah.

and then i guess you know

one last point is

and this was something easier for next to do than microsoft

you know

next being a small company

steve made it a point to personally try to recruit me. yeah. and he would

he would do the follow-up calls go over the offer letter and i just can't decide. he said

well

let me offer you this.

you know what i mean? whereas bill couldn't do that.

the company was too big for bill to do that.

and you know there there sort of legendary stories about steve walk taking people on recruiting walks.

did you guys

what was the sort of the dance with steve? did you ever like go on a walk with steve while he was

we did not do a recruiting walk

but that's because just i was in pittsburgh again and he was in paloalto. yeah.

but, you know, steve,

what steve did was somehow i think

that part of, oh, we've met before is part of the whole thing.

i don't

i don't

i don't think that was quite

i think he thought i was someone else.

um

but for example,

one of the things that he did was

# Chapter 8

he would do the follow-up calls go over the offer letter and i just can't decide. he said

well

let me offer you this.

you know what i mean? whereas bill couldn't do that.

the company was too big for bill to do that.

and you know there there sort of legendary stories about steve walk taking people on recruiting walks.

did you guys

what was the sort of the dance with steve? did you ever like go on a walk with steve while he was

we did not do a recruiting walk

but that's because just i was in pittsburgh again and he was in paloalto. yeah.

but, you know, steve,

what steve did was somehow i think

that part of, oh, we've met before is part of the whole thing.

i don't

i don't

i don't think that was quite

i think he thought i was someone else.

um

but for example,

one of the things that he did was

when i think he identified me as someone he wanted to hire and someone that he knew.

subsequent to our first meeting in paloalto, he had had

he was on a visit at carnegie melon with again some of his team

and he

and his team took a bunch of us grad students out for dinner

and he was just being real nice to me and joking and remember

at the end of the dinner

he said send that guy the bill pointing at me and he would

just

you know

do things like that to be a little more familiar and a little more

you know

earthy

if you will.

yeah.

um

so

uh

had had

um

by the time you joined

had

um

nex

left deer creek and gone over to redwood city. no.

so you got there while it was still at

we're still at deer creek. um

we didn't leave for

i think at least a year after that.

okay.

maybe maybe even longer. we

we launched the next product in october of 88 while we were in deer creek.

okay. and so that launch is a famous event. um

uh

what was your role in

did you develop software for the launch

uh

demo in itself?

okay. so well

there's the version in this in the jobs movie

which is not true. um

and i tried to explain the truth to aaron sorcin

but he obviously didn't listen. um

so the

i have a vivid memory of the leadup of a part of the leadup to that

which is

um

two or three days before the launch

um

we were working on the optical drive

and

um

so i was part of the os team

chief operating system scientist

something that gave me this fancy title as a way to entice me to go work there

smart

um

so i wasn't responsible for the optical driver. i was responsible for more the core of the os.

um,

and it was working pretty well, but the optical driver was unreliable. and um,

i remember the guy working on it, outstanding engineer,

his name is john seammons.

um,

he was, you know,

burning the midnight oil just trying to get this thing working.

and about three days before the intro, and this has got to work.

um, i'm like, " okay, i gotta roll up my sleeves and help john.

" so, i dive in with john, fresh eyes on the problem.

and it was just unreliable.

and i said, " okay, we got to do something.

we got to start building reliability tests for the file system so we can figure out

is it a driver problem? is it the file system?

" whatever.

and so, i built a very simple unix level test to read

and write files in a slightly random way and ran it and it failed immediately.

and i built in logging and stuff

so we could then figure out what was going on. we went

and we

and we tested

and and we looked at the logs. we figured out the bug.

great. we fixed it. good. we're all set to launch. let's let's take

but before we do that, let's take the testing to the next level.

and so he and i kept iterating on these test programs to the point where

um

we

we finally had a test program

which was basically issuing random file system instructions to the os completely random.

no program would ever do this just to get it to fail. and we would see these failure modes.

oh yeah, that's a bug.

and oh yeah, that's a bug

because even though it's random, it should still work, right? and so we finally got it all to work.

and we

i think the two of us worked almost continuously for 48 hours.

wow. to make that work. was it stressful? was that your

i

i don't remember it being stressful. i just remember being wow

this is so cool. it's like

i mean it's so hard.

but i mean these are the hardest kinds of bugs to find.

i mean i remember before i'd been trying to find bugs in the virtual memory system

where suddenly your memory isn't right

and that's all you know is the memory isn't right.

and this could be 5 seconds after it went bad that you discover this.

and how do you discover those bugs?

and we're working on hard problems like that, which is extremely satisfying.

but we finally got it to work. yeah.

and and i remember i learned a lesson from that, which is, you know,

all of us engineers think we can write code that works.

but what you really got to do to test your code is throw garbage at it

and then see what happens.

when you th throw things at it

that is what you expect. yes, it works.

but a lot of times developers throw things at it that you didn't expect. yeah.

but that

so that was the leadup to the to the um intro

from my perspective

just getting the basic stuff to work.

there's a lot of other stuff going on that i was still helping others with.

you know, all the demos. you were there. i assume i was.

and the demos were incredible. yeah. and they all worked. at the actual event at davies hall itself,

were you in the audience

or were you backstage? i was in the audience.

yeah. okay. now, there's a bit of legend that you can help me with. um, apocryphal.

i heard that, you know, there was an intermission.

it was such an an event.

i heard that the machine crashed during the intermission. it was rebooted and it worked

and nobody knew. do you know if that's true? that is possible.

i don't remember.

um, i believe there was a hot spare anyway.

we've always had hot spares for as long as i can remember. yeah.

yeah.

so that you could swap out.

oh, that was

it was supposed to be the luck of steve jobs

that it would happen backstage and no one would know about it.

you know, bill would always give demonstrations and it would crash during the right.

right. yeah.

it's it's possible. i don't remember.

yeah.

what was the just your going to next and working there

just sort of top level

this description about,

you know,

you came from an academic environment, all of a sudden you were thrown into a steve jobs world.

what what was the shift like? um, that's a good question.

let me think about that for a second.

so, for me, a lot of it seemed the same

because i was just always working hard, trying to make things work, right? um,

there was probably a little bit more of a feeling of being a part of a a whole team

that is doing more than just building this os.

i mean, we had people do

we have bu people building the hardware.

we had people worrying about how to sell it, how to market it. um

we had hr teams, you know,

we had this whole this whole thing. and we also had um

a different level of sort of frenzy in terms of it's actually going to work.

this is not research.

this is something people are going to pay for

and we actually have deadlines, right? so

when we announced that october 17 or something announcement, it was going to be announced

then we weren't going to change that. and so we had to work 24 by7 to make it work

at least well enough for the demo. there was a famous wall street journal story

um

which quoted a pr woman in the first paragraph.

kathy cook was an outside pr woman.

she was quoted as saying, " they're carrying them out in body bags to describe how hard you guys were working.

" do you remember that? and it created quite a stir outside the company.

i don't know what it was like inside the company.

there were no body bags. there were no beds inside. um

but i remember my personal work habit was to work as long as i could, go home

and sleep,

and then come back in and work as long as i could, no matter what the time was.

yeah.

and i remember there were many of us who would be working all night

and then we'd go to denny's at 3 : 00 a.

m. to get some food and then go back and work some more. yeah.

and then go home at 7 : 00 a. m.

8 a. m. sleep a little bit

then come back.

were you single at that point? of course.

and when you came out to the valley, where did you live initially? i

uh

i lived in mountain view. had a small apartment in mountain view. yeah.

so so it was

it was

uh

it was a hacker's existence basically. it was a hacker's existence and i loved it. yeah.

and so you came out with that title.

were you responsible for nextep? is that the right way to describe your your initial role? not initially.

initially i was responsible for the core os

which was in

well

initially

i was an engineer. okay. i was one engineer of several.

um

you know

they looked up to me because it was my code base. a lot of it was

um

but i was responsible basically for making sure

that what we had built at carnegie melon had been ported to the next computer.

it worked.

then you know

like a year later i took over the whole os group

which me meant only the compiler and a few other things

and then i ultimately took budge job.

yeah.

yeah. and architecturally

this was a 6840 6820

i can't remember.

uh

i think it was a 30

60

6830

25 meghertz

and the perk had been a mini computer

or it had been a microprocessor

bas

i think the perk was

uh

custom architecture.

yeah.

yeah.

so, this was your first real experience with the 68, 000 family

or oh, no.

you've been a mac programmer, so you you knew it pretty well.

i had been a mac programmer myself, but we had

never

i don't think we'd ever ported mach to the 68, 000 series. yeah.

but i was

i mean,

being a mac programmer meant i knew the instruction set.

that was probably an advantage. but i had never done os level stuff

and the mac didn't even have virtual memory in it.

yeah. so, we were working at a very different level. yeah.

and and did the

you know

steve had taken this team or a port

you know

some version of this team through this drill before with the macintosh

um

they

he'd sort of run this drill once

well

several times before

but the

the

you know

the mac experience was this very sort of dramatic and well

doumented

was

there

did you feel like there was mac culture still in the next organization

or he built another kind of culture at that point

um

there was a little bit of matt culture

but i saw that more from the perspective of everyone who wasn't an engineer was using a mac.

so if they email

well

actually there wasn't much email back then

but they were doing desktop publishing on their macs

or whatever they did

they were doing pretty much on their macs.

only the engineers had the actual computers because they didn't quite work.

um

and so you know

you have to remember

i didn't know what the mac culture was back then anyway.

so i can't say for sure if it was

or it wasn't.

and i'm sure some things were similar, some things weren't. yeah. yeah.

and did you get involved in as as you got in on the project

and got more responsibility, did you have at any point responsibility for some of the higher levels of the stack, the app kit,

um,

interface builder, um,

next step layers

or was that?

yeah.

so, i don't remember what year it was,

but um, when i became vp of software, i had all that stuff.

yeah. and and um sort of just roughly scale

when you came

how many people were doing software

and as you sort of

how did it

how did it grow over time?

okay, so when i got there

the company was probably 70 people. um

i was employee 80some

and i assume a few people had left. um

and most of the people were in engineering

um

and they were probably roughly evenly split between hardware and software.

yeah.

exact numbers, who knows?

yeah.

so, maybe 25 software, 25 hardware,

then everybody else in, you know,

finance and marketing and sales,

things like that. how big was the os team? um,

the os team was probably three or four people.

wow. yeah.

i have two very clear memories of steve giving me factory tours.

once i got a tour of the mac factory

and once i got a tour of the next factory

which was

both of them

actually were highly automated.

you know

this is 85 83 to 87

88.

did you involve yourself with the factory at all? not really.

um

we'd have meetings over there every once in a while

just you know i was part of the executive team.

um

so once a month

or so

we'd have our executive team meeting over there just to keep them connected

and so we were aware what was going on.

but i didn't work with them really. not really at all.

yeah. you

you

you

this was not hollywood, but this was sort of silicon valley's equivalent of

that world, but it was just intense interest at that time

sort of from when steve started

to

you know,

everybody wanted to know what was going on next.

did that affect you at all? it didn't affect me at all.

and you know,

it's probably because i was so focused on the work, right? and it dominated everything

and

um

it

just it

just,

you know,

it wasn't on my radar. now, yeah,

i mean, sometimes i'd be out at dinner and maybe i'd be with steve

and people would recognize us and ask us things that are going on or whatever,

but that was not necessarily the norm. that was just on occasion.

yeah.

so there were these kind of myths that drove silicon valley. um

um

you know

going all the way back to alan k's dynabook

um

sort of this notion

and

and you know

during the macintosh days

steve probably expressed it best when he referred to the personal computer as a bicycle for the mind

and then he was clearly doing that with next.

i mean it was clearly in line with that kind of you know tool to learn

and and do science and all of that stuff.

did did that capture you? um

i mean

were

were you sort of in that kind of worldview and yes and no.

but you know, i was an engineer, okay?

and i was like, let's i mean, i love the technology, but i'm like, let's get this to work.

and the other people can worry about these grand visions, okay? but i'm like, this is so cool.

i want to make this work. i remember the first time i got audio to work.

i had no grand vision of what was going to happen with audio

and computers, okay? but one day, the hardware guys gave me a board.

they said, " we think audio works on this board. can you make it work in the os?

so, i spent a couple days and did. i'm like, this is so cool. yeah.

and

and you know, i was always the type of person who was, okay, what's the task at hand? how do we get it done? how do we push

that envelope a little bit more? right.

and the grand vision will take care of itself.

interesting.

but then you

you moved

as you moved up and became a vice president, um

did you get

did you get involved in the strategy component of sort of where next was going as a company

much

or absolutely.

and and i would say

um

i had a chance to do that well before i became a vice president.

first of all,

we were a small company.

second of all, i had formed a good relationship with steve

and the rest of the management team early on

because of my role.

so, they didn't look at me as your run-of-the-mill engineer they hired to work on, you know,

piece of software x.

so, i always had really great access.

like i said, i was part of the executive team even though i wasn't a vp,

which is kind of unusual.

yeah.

so, i'd get to go in and listen to what was going on. and, you know,

to be honest,

in those early years, i was more in learn mode than anything else.

like, here's all these really great guys who know what they're talking about. i'm learning from them. yeah.

# Chapter 9

much

or absolutely.

and and i would say

um

i had a chance to do that well before i became a vice president.

first of all,

we were a small company.

second of all, i had formed a good relationship with steve

and the rest of the management team early on

because of my role.

so, they didn't look at me as your run-of-the-mill engineer they hired to work on, you know,

piece of software x.

so, i always had really great access.

like i said, i was part of the executive team even though i wasn't a vp,

which is kind of unusual.

yeah.

so, i'd get to go in and listen to what was going on. and, you know,

to be honest,

in those early years, i was more in learn mode than anything else.

like, here's all these really great guys who know what they're talking about. i'm learning from them. yeah.

i have to tell you from the outside,

i always thought of you as one of the executive team.

i mean, i'm just thinking back on next.

if i think of who the key guys were next, you were

you were,

you know,

that's the way it looked from the outside.

well, and that's because i had an unusual role as an engineer.

i quickly did become a manager and a director.

and from day one, they used me externally to talk about things.

so when we would do a conference, i would be a speaker and i would talk about different things.

so, so i did have some of that role. yeah.

and then,

you know,

steve cultivated the higher education community deciduously before and then during.

did he use you in, you know,

going out outreach to the higher education community

and were you involved in that sort of dance that went on a little bit? um,

you know,

obviously computer science departments were a pretty good target for us.

and so when there'd be an interesting computer science department to visit, they would make use of me. um,

and even beyond education,

when we

when we diversified to more customers, the salesforce used me quite a bit. yeah.

and so just i'm trying to remember there were

there were bunch of interesting people who were part of the the next team

and one person who came down

um

from reed

um

was a physicist. i'm trying to remember

i'm blanking richard crannle. crannle did he very good friend of mine. did he work with you? so richard

so i don't know if you know

but richard died a few years ago. i do. i do.

um,

sadly,

um,

richard was probably my best friend at next.

okay.

and and you know, so my best friends at next were were were richard and steve.

yeah.

and re this great story about richard. when i arrived at next

for my first day in paloalto in april of 88

and i flew in to san francisco. um

i think they put me up in a

they probably put me in a hotel for the night

and it was evening and i had nothing to do

so i said i'll go into the office.

so, it's like 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night

and i'm going into the office and i go in there and i find richard

and he was the only one there and we just hit it off

and

um

you know

from then on we were just like best friends. yeah.

and what kinds of things did he do inside next? i i always thought of him as sort of outward facing to the educational community.

did did he do design stuff too? so richard was our karajin. he would always find things wrong.

and that day, that night, i went in and met him for the very first time.

he's like, " who are you? what are you doing here? "

and i explained to him, " i'm brand new.

" he said, " oh, well, you should know everything's broken.

" and that was typical richard cranle.

and so what richard would do

is

um

he was an education ambassador. um

and so he would write educational apps. yeah.

and what he would do is he would force us to make sure everything below that worked.

so he would try to push the envelope.

and so his role from an engineering perspective was to say, " well, this doesn't work

and i need to use it.

" and he was a physicist by trade.

so he didn't always do things the way they were intended to be done.

so we'd find interesting things based on him trying to use things. um,

but then he did have a big outward role, too.

i mean, he was part of that first keynote demoing some of the apps that he had written. um

very smart guy, very interesting to be around.

so that you showed up in april of 88

and the computer was introduced in october of 88,

right? okay.

and at that point, i'm trying going back in history

now

when you launched

it was still an educational strategy and ed educational

you were

steve had found a way to carve out the space for himself where he wasn't directly competing

or you know

he said he wasn't directly competing against apple and sun and ibm, right? what did it look like?

what did it feel like inside the company in terms of

that strate market strategy? that's exactly what we thought too.

um

i mean we knew we were building a general computer, right? but we always thought of our primary market, maybe not only market, but our primary market is education.

yeah.

and are there sort of attributes of the

you know there

sort of those those little vignettes you gave of like meeting with

uh

meeting with rick or working around the clock? describe next culture.

um,

is there anything else that was sort of emblematic

of

i mean now we know google culture.

what was next culture like?

so we did have a little bit of

i mean there you

you

in retrospect

there was a bunch of us that worked in my mold

but we also had some people who were married and didn't work that way.

they worked the more nineto-five job

and there's a little bit

of

you know we didn't always get along or see eye on a lot of those things

just a little bit

but at the end we all pulled together and knew what we were doing

but you know

we believed we were on a mission and we were building

i mean this

what we built was incredible for the time

and we knew that

and we just knew we had to make it work

and

uh

we knew that we were

you know

setting the stage for everything to follow afterwards

and

and so we all knew we're on a mission

just in general

working really hard. now, it was also very stressful

because it was a lot to get done quickly

and a lot of new things that we were inventing, things that had never been done before.

it described the optical drive. you know,

no one had ever done that before

and it had some hard things

where you don't just write the optical drive, you erase it, you write it,

and then you verify it every time you write.

and that had never been done before.

and to take an existing os and make it work in that model efficiently was not trivial. yeah,

there was so much i remember when that was one of the points of skepticism about

you know there was a performance point of skepticism around optical

and what did i mean outside there you you

it was sort of show me and where

where did what did it look like inside from a sort of well

we were all worried about it too

um

no question

and but you know

when you're an engineer

you try and solve it right

and so okay

we know that writing is incred incredibly slow.

okay.

so, what are we going to do to minimize the rights and you just try and make it work?

yeah.

and in the end, it was a limitation and we put in a hard drive. yeah.

let's see. did it ever ship with the optical?

i can't remember at what point it did. it did.

it did ultimately. yeah, i think so.

yeah. yeah.

and did you was one of the tricks using cache to get around the low?

yeah.

i mean, they're all standard tricks, right? caching, having higher level software be aware of what it's doing.

did you realize that you're writing all this data? oh, no.

i didn't

i didn't need to do that.

yeah, it's things like that. do did you have much interaction? there was an early app developer, i think.

was it called lighthouse software that jonathan

um schwarz

was the lighthouse design?

lighthouse design.

that's right.

yes, lighthouse design.

i know

jonathan,

you brought them in early and and well, so i don't know.

i mean, they were in pittsburgh. they're

i think they're all carnegie bell people

and they loved the next

and they started building apps

and we took note of people building apps, especially good apps like they were building.

yeah. so, um

did you there

there was kind of a small talk like dynamic object-oriented lang language.

were you involved? did you get involved in the at the language level? was a little bit a little more so

when i became manager of the group

because i was part of the compiler.

you're talking about objective c. objective c. yeah.

um

it was basically the c language

with a little bit of small talk sprinkled in is the best way to think about it. yeah.

exists today. people use it. people still use it today for ios. yeah.

and is it it's still called objective c in yes.

yeah. yes.

yeah.

um

so one of the questions was that we had heard that at various points

c + + and even display postcript were considered for the development language of next step.

were there sort of steps along the way to so the

the language for the screen was was display postcript wasn't

that is what it was.

yeah. um

and that was also profound. yeah.

um

and and even today

um

on a mac or an iphone, it's basically pdf is what's going on.

it's a pdf-like thing. so postcript is still the pdf.

so that model still continues today. for the c + + issue, um

we never considered c + + as a development language for the os itself, for next step itself.

but at some point we had been so beat up

by people saying they wanted to use c + +.

we built a version of c + + we called objective c +

+

which let it coexist with objective c.

never got used very much.

it became more of a checklist item for certain customers who wanted it but it was never a mainstream language for next.

yeah.

yeah.

um

at some point you ended up working with mr. stallman.

um

was richard in the loop

and what is it like to try to collaborate with richard stallman?

so we collaborated with richard stallman because we used

uh

his compiler gcc

and

um

so had dinner with him a few times. always an interesting experience. very smart guy, very non-traditional though.

yeah.

uh

very set in his ways.

um

and you know we were very appreciative of the work that he had done

and we wanted to be a good steward of what he had done.

working hand

inand

with him

giving back changes

we had made suggestions

and just that was

you know

we never

i never worked directly with him

but i helped to facilitate the relationship a little bit

we had some engineers who worked more closely with him and his team

is what i would say

also

you want

oh yeah

i was curious

as how did you decide to use objective c as the as the

the basis for all of the frameworks

so the decision to use objective c was done prior to me arriving at next

and the fundamental reason for it was the team wanted to use object or object-oriented programming

and there weren't a lot of choices.

so you could use small talk and never have a product that ships,

right? uh

or you could use c + + and not really have object-oriented programming. you would have object-oriented sugar syntax

and that was it.

so, objective c was the only real object-oriented programming that existed,

at least language for it.

yeah. yeah. okay.

um,

so ultimately you were able to build this hybrid of open and proprietary

which continued on into the into the apple

where you know you

you were leveraging

um

you were leveraging an an open-source community

and and you know sort of the best of both worlds in this hybrid way.

um

was that strategic? i mean did you set about to do that as a as a strategic direction?

um

yes

and no.

um

there was a feeling

that there were areas

that we would adding we would have just incredible added value for things

that were brand new that should be kept proprietary

and and unique.

but other areas you didn't need to do that. so,

you know,

networking,

why wouldn't you support tcp ip

and be open, right? there's no reason to have a whole new separate networking language, if you will.

and so, that was sort of the general thinking.

um, and the nature of our business was we had many things

where interoperability or reuse was more important than being proprietary

and other areas where you could do something where proprietary really wasn't going to hurt you

and it added a lot of value and had a lot of differentiation.

yeah.

very pragmatic then. it's very pragmatic. yeah. yeah.

i remember

um

sort of after you guys got os 10 up

and running, bud came to give a talk at berkeley once

and at some point

like half of the lines in the code of os 10 he said were open source.

i mean i was just struck

the number was that large. um

that does not surprise me. yeah.

and and it's because there's a very large unix core

um

that's basically these days all open source.

and actually we we open sourced our version of it as well. yeah.

um

and you

um

so i think you you've kind of answered

you have this practical view of open source. um

in terms of getting of shipping

next step

um

did it stay in beta after it was out in the world

when

when

when the next was shipping

the first cube was

so

i think the first cube we shipped had version 0. 8

which obviously was we didn't call it beta

we called it 0. 8 a um

and then we shipped a 0. 9 and then we shipped a 1. 0.

i don't remember the exact dates, but we realized that the first version we were shipping wasn't 1. 0.

yeah.

yeah.

um

in brent shen schlender's book, he writes

that you wrote the music synthesis program that played during the keynote demo.

um

is there is

that is not correct.

um

i don't know if he wrote that or not,

but i know if he did, it's not correct.

correct.

um,

so what i wrote

i described a little while ago was the first test program to verify that sound actually worked.

the demo, at least one of the demos, the most interesting demo at that introduction

um

was when the computer played with the violinist

and that was done

um

from the dsp with synthesized instruments. and i did not write that.

yeah.

i worked with people that wrote that. i did not write that. yeah.

and um

i think you've

i mean

you know

if you look back at the nextstep project and and the challenges and getting it to the market initially

what

what do you remember as being

you know

the the hurdles

like hurdles that stick out in your mind

as as

um

well

so i talked about the optical drive

huge hurdle. um

most things were just good old engineering work

but the optical drive was definitely paradigm issues. um

we were

we were getting into new space

providing developer tools

um

at a

at a level never done before

and that required a certain level of ways to work with developers

which also required adoption.

and one of the challenges was, you know,

we're building a new platform and we couldn't build all the apps ourselves.

so we had to have other people who would build apps for us.

and that was a big challenge. you know, i mean, pricing, right?

and this wasn't really a software issue, but it was a hardware issue.

# Chapter 10

as as

um

well

so i talked about the optical drive

huge hurdle. um

most things were just good old engineering work

but the optical drive was definitely paradigm issues. um

we were

we were getting into new space

providing developer tools

um

at a

at a level never done before

and that required a certain level of ways to work with developers

which also required adoption.

and one of the challenges was, you know,

we're building a new platform and we couldn't build all the apps ourselves.

so we had to have other people who would build apps for us.

and that was a big challenge. you know, i mean, pricing, right?

and this wasn't really a software issue, but it was a hardware issue.

the the staggering cost of the hardware from a cost perspective,

and then you translate into what it what you have to charge for it, that was a huge hurdle.

yeah.

just going into the market with a new computer.

i mean, you'd be insane to do that today, right? yeah. yeah.

um,

jumping a little bit forward, there was a point where the company's strategy shifted from educational to business productivity.

what can you tell us about

that process from the from the inside? i remember how how it struck the the industry

or the

you know

the computer trade journalism industry is like a huge deal.

i know next was shifting gears. well, so i forget the exact timing, but the big deal there was

we signed a deal with businessland. i don't know if you remember that.

yeah, i do. i do.

but um

i don't know if that was in conjunction with our push into business

or sort of right along with it.

and um

they

i believe they committed to buying something like a hund00 million worth of product over some interesting period of time, maybe a year

or something.

um,

and i remember,

um,

shortly after we did that deal, they invited me and steve to go down to some event

where ronald reagan was speaking of all people,

just,

you know,

to celebrate the fact that we had done that deal. um

and and so we were really jazzed about that

because business land was a real company that sold to businesses and they had basically produced, you know,

soft pos for $ 100 million worth of product

which is way more than we had ever sold. yeah.

so we're pretty jazzed about that.

uh

but then they went out of business. so yeah.

was that i'm trying to remember now

where that uh stood with the sort of the politics of os2

and what was going on in the broader industry.

were you were you

at some point

were you moving toward competing head-to-head with this new sort

of

there was a

there was a tren

a phase change in in the broader desktop industry as well. i remember our biggest competitor was always sun.

yeah.

we were more compared to the workstation market and um

we had

i remember

we had done some uh marketing programs specifically. uh

i remember

we did this one program

where we had two programmers, one programming with nextstep, one programming with the sun tool set side

by side on camera and the next guy obliterated the sun guy.

u

we did a little, you know, 15 20 minute video. it's probably on youtube. um

uh

and so we we really started competing at that level. yeah.

yeah.

and the the transition.

so then there came the transition to the intel hardware, moving away from 6848.

do do you remember why you chose to move away from the motorola architecture

and go with intel? well, the intel was not about using intel hardware ourselves.

it was about selling software on pcs. yeah.

uh

the thinking there being these guys building pcs can do it for zero profit margin, right?

and they're at scale and we're not.

simple as that.

yeah.

and but that that for you that that meant

then you had to take this operating system and move it to a new architecture.

how

how how hard was it to move next step?

that was our specialty. remember we had mock

which is already portable.

yeah.

yeah.

so, you know, that was easy

and

and in fact we ended up porting it to the x86 to the pa risk to the power architecture to spark.

um, you know, we were turnurning them out, you know,

give us the funding or commit to go

and six months later we'd have a running.

yeah.

we

we

we

we ported to some processor that never shipped the 88k.

remember the 88k?

i do remember the 88k.

we had it running on 88k prototypes. yeah.

and the decision process inside was it was it

um

you know

did you debate inside about whether to you know to go from from one architecture to to a software base? of course.

um

do you remember who was on what side and what it was like? you know i don't remember

exactly

but obviously that kind of a decision is something that hardware people don't like. uh

and almost everybody else does just generally speaking. yeah.

yeah.

um,

and do you remember

where steve was? sometimes i know that steve has to be brought around on issues

and then he becomes a champion at a certain point.

do do you remember?

that's right.

and and usually

um,

you know,

to expand further on what you're saying, usually things have to get pretty bad before it gets brought around.

yeah.

not always,

but usually.

and i think that's what was starting to go on here, which is

i mean, this hardware business is a tough one.

not only are we not selling very much, but it's capital intensive and, you know,

risky and and still not working. yeah.

and and oh, by the way,

most people see the value in the software. yeah.

where was bud trible on on that issue

porting to intel? um, i do not remember.

and in fact, it may have been that bud had already gone to sun,

so i'm not sure.

yeah.

yeah.

bud,

i mean there were,

you know,

there were people who had been so close to steve

um

who at various points left. do you remember that as being painful?

i mean, but leaving. yeah, absolutely.

yeah.

that's another one of those things i remember vividly.

for some reason, i was at home in my apartment not working. i get a phone call from steve

and he was practically in tears.

he said, " you're not going to believe this, but is leaving.

" and i said, " really? where's he going to say? you're not going to believe this.

he's going to sign.

" yeah. and he just could not believe it.

it was he's like, i don't understand how i could possibly do this. yeah.

and were you close to bud at all? did you get a view into that about what his personal

um,

i was pretty close to bud.

um, i'm sure i talked to him after this, but i don't really remember.

we talked about it was so long ago. i'm sure he gave me some good reasons about yeah.

why he was doing it, what the opportunity was, something like that, but i don't remember exactly.

do you remember?

oh, go ahead. i'm sorry. what was it like to work with bud?

i loved working with bud.

um,

you know,

bud,

one of the smartest people you'll ever meet,

very nice person. um,

always wants to do the right thing,

always, you can always have a great discussion with him. um,

never got very social with him. um, probably because he was married and i wasn't.

um,

but he was just a great guy to work for.

yeah. and did did dana leave before or after? dan

did i think dana left before? yeah. yeah. i think dana left pretty early. yeah.

yeah.

so, in terms of your career, your your your time at at nex going from engineering to management, did what was

that as as a learning experience

and sort of learning to be a manager? and it was trial

by fire.

um,

you know,

i became a manager like within a year of joining next,

i think.

wow.

um,

but we were small.

we all knew each other really well.

there wasn't much managing to do.

um, again, i'm coming from being thought of as

that benevolent dictator on the mock project, which is probably not a good management trait.

um,

and i'm sure i learned that along the way.

um

but again

as far as i was concerned

we were also heads down at that point in time

just trying to get things done. yeah.

you know

yeah

we did annual reviews

but as to standard hr practices

very little at least at that time.

so i was

you know

i was learning

trial by fire

learn what works

learn

what doesn't work.

yeah.

in terms of sort of picking a replacement for bud.

um

were there others who were in contention? do you remember any of it

how steve chose?

was it was it paul heaggerty was being considered as

well?

do you know if that was correct?

so i'm not sure who took over after, but it might have been paul

but i'm not sure. i don't remember.

okay.

but then ultimately

then ultimately i took over. yeah. yeah.

so

um

so in that period when you managed software

so what are the sort of milestones that that you accomplished?

well

so i think if you look at sort of the assume you're asking about sort of the big ticket items

things that got done.

so i mean obviously we had next steps starting with the intro making it into a real product.

i think we took it through like 3.

0 or something as a product.

we introduced some really innovative features in it like distributed objects, enterprise objects framework.

these are things that were just groundbreaking at the time.

we had it such that it could communicate with windows systems over the network through an object model.

um

we built this product called pdio, portable distributed objects, which was our distributed object technology running on any

that was part of the windows angle.

then we ported it as a whole os to all these different architectures. intel, hppa risk, um,

power architecture, um,

the 88000, um,

etc., etc.,

etc.

um,

and then we took, uh,

the higher levels of it

and turned it into openstep, which then ran on solaris

and windows, was going to run on aix at one point.

um,

that's right.

uh,

that was an andy heler deal. do you remember this? i remember the deal. i don't remember andy.

yeah.

he was the head of the of the rt business. okay. yeah. um

and then

um

so i mean these were all really great innovations through the years

and then we had this

what i thought was a revolutionary product

web objects

which was the very first server-based application service ever. ever.

what year would that have been roughly? would that have been 9495 by then?

uh

yeah,

maybe.

yeah, probably i think so.

the s1 says it shipped in 96.

okay.

so, a little bit later.

that's when it first could be somewhere in that range.

yeah. yeah. we would have been working on it before that.

so, maybe 95ish.

so, you know, we we haven't asked you about this, but you know, the web was built on next.

how much of it was

i mean, from being inside next, how much did you have a early sense

that the web was going to be a worldchanging architecture?

so i think we got that not because of the client being on nex,

but because we built web objects.

yeah.

okay.

and the client being on x was kind of cool, but all you had was static websites, which is interesting for researchers

and a few things like that.

but

when we built this first web server

and we started thinking about all the things that could now be done, you know,

we built demos of a car selector where you pick models and options and colors

and it's changing in real time. you know, you have to refresh the page back then, but it changes.

and we built the first system that ever tied into saber for booking tickets.

i mean, who would have ever thought?

and so, we just knew then that we had something. yeah. so just

and and yet next you know

you could

you could almost see a

you know a business strategy based on that insight

and yet you weren't able to to sort of take it to the to the scale

that the web became.

well, that's because we got bought by apple. yeah. right. and so i think

um you know, if we hadn't got bought by apple,

web objects would have become a huge business

because we know how big these web services businesses are today. and it could have been a very

very large business.

yeah.

and i don't see any reason why it wouldn't because we had a huge head start on on everybody.

you can't even

you can't even say head start on the competition

because there was no competition.

there's maybe one other guy out there, cold fusion, i think it was,

that was even doing anything that got bought

by adobe.

yeah. yeah. that's interesting. um,

who sort of in terms of that openstep licensing decision, do you remember who's how that came about

inside next was for ibm? uh,

no.

i was thinking about sun.

oh, openstep on solaris and openstep on solaris.

windows and windows

and well, so windows wasn't a licensing situation.

that was us just having a product to sell with solaris.

i'm trying to remember how far that got. um,

i was told that the source code for the app kit was actually licensed to sun. it was

and we sent some engineers over to help them port it.

i don't know that they ever shipped it. um, it was we

we probably had things in place that made it too hard

like it had to be done in a clean room so

that anyone from sun working on it couldn't work on other sun projects

or talk to them.

all these requirements

and maybe that had a little bit to do with slowing it down.

we had some next employees on site

and i think you know it's probably one of those things

where sun probably had some antibodies that didn't want it to succeed anyway.

that wouldn't surprise me. most companies of that size have that kind of a problem. yeah.

but it just it just never got out. and and

um

a little bit more about web objects

um

you know

is there more of a backstory

sort of what you know

what were the sort of threads coming into web objects or what drove it

or you know

well

i remember

so i know i was running

i was running the software group at the time one of the guys

and engineers came to me and said got this idea

we can have a server that you send info to and it does something and then sends html back

i'm like

what do you mean

and he showed me a little demo of a very simple script like that's pretty cool.

we can do something with that.

so i authorized him and a couple other guys to go spend some resources on it. said okay

go build this and come back and then show them when you've got something a little more real.

and i mean it's one of those things where the first time you see that demo

it's like

of course this is the way it should be. yeah.

oh

and web objects was built on top of enterprise objects framework.

um

i would say it a little bit differently. web objects was built on the side of enterprise objects framework.

so

uh

web objects didn't require enterprise objects framework. eof

is what we called it, but it benefited from it if you had a data source.

so you would use eof to access a database.

didn't have to, but it was the easiest way to do it. yeah.

and h

how did how did the eof project come about? the eof project came about much earlier. uh

its first instantiation was something we called dbkit, database kit. uh

we had kits for everything and we knew accessing databases was important

and so we built a kit that let you access databases

and then we discovered what people liked and didn't like about it and redid it as eof.

yeah.

# Chapter 11

and i mean it's one of those things where the first time you see that demo

it's like

of course this is the way it should be. yeah.

oh

and web objects was built on top of enterprise objects framework.

um

i would say it a little bit differently. web objects was built on the side of enterprise objects framework.

so

uh

web objects didn't require enterprise objects framework. eof

is what we called it, but it benefited from it if you had a data source.

so you would use eof to access a database.

didn't have to, but it was the easiest way to do it. yeah.

how did how did the eof project come about? the eof project came about much earlier. uh

we had kits for everything and we knew accessing databases was important

and so we built a kit that let you access databases

and then we discovered what people liked and didn't like about it and redid it as eof.

yeah.

okay.

um

i'd forgotten this

an attempted um

next ipo.

do you

yes.

when did that

i'm totally lost in history. so my history

so

um

attempted in the form

it wasn't actually attempted in that

there was a registration

but there was an s1 that was 95 % done.

i've donated it the an original copy to the museum. okay. um

and

uh

we were working on it. i i think the draft is dated november of 96. uh

which was the same time we began discussions with apple. ah

okay.

so apple basically preempted it. yeah. okay. so yeah. um

and at that point

um

talk a little bit about java and was there a next java strategy

and where did java fit in the in the puzzle? uh

there was no real next java strategy at the time.

java came later on mostly for compatibility reasons. yeah. yeah.

actually, so blaine gar told me

that he had actually um created the java bridge for web objects while still at next.

is that correct? that's entirely possible. yeah. i don't

i don't remember the exact details on those dates. okay. yeah.
