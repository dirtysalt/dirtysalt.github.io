# Chapter 1

well, i'm glad you're still here.

 i'm also glad i'm still here.

 yes.

 i mean, those of us who know you and who have followed you,

 uh, looked at our phones one morning in august, i think,

 and it was pablo dv disappears in france,

 arrested.

 um, and then, you know, no one heard from you for several days.

 it was it was kind of

 it was actually kind of a pivot point in the way i understand europe,

 speaking for myself.

 so, if you don't mind, i don't think you've done any interviews since then.

 what like what happened that day?

 you just like the events of the day.

 let's start there.

 august last year.

 august last year, i arrived to paris

 and i'm greeted in the airport by a few what were you doing here?

 i just

 for touristic

 po purposes

 like i was just hanging

 around for

 a couple of days and i was supposed to go to finland

 after

 and

 i wasn't supposed to stay.

 there was no business meeting of any kind and i was greeted by policemen.

 they asked me certain questions asked me to follow them.

 were you confused like why are policemen meeting me at the airport?

 definitely.

 at first i thought there may be some additional

 security checks because of the olympics of the parolympics.

 something's going on.

 julia, my girlfriend, she was worried.

 she was asking me is is it all right?

 i said it's all right.

 it's france.

 it's fine.

 of course.

 and and then they read me a list of charges like i know 16 charges

 all kinds of crimes.

 i was very confused at first because like i have nothing to do with crime.

 i've never been convicted.

 i have, you know,

 we are a company that is trying to comply with the with the best standards.

 and and so at at at that moment, i realized that

 it's not something i did, it's something other people did using the app i created,

 telegram, which is used by a billion people.

 so probably some people do you know all of them or unfortunately, not.

 okay.

 unfortunately.

 um i try my best to meet more but

 so yeah and then i was put into a car and

 with a small motorcade with police cars with sirens and

 which is funny because in pre in the previous countries that i visited

 i also was accompanied by motorcades because i was visiting the heads of states there.

 and here in france there was certain consistency.

 so i was greeted in the same way so to say.

 were you like texting?

 i couldn't because they took my phone and i wasn't they immediately took your phone?

 yeah.

 i wasn't allowed to contact anyone except for my assistant

 who i

 asked to find me some lawyers

 and reach out to certain friends that i have and try to understand what was going

 on.

 and then i spent four days in police custody.

 a building in south of paris that

 that is i think run by the police customs the customs police officers or department whatever

 and there i had

 to answer a lot of questions

 but you spent 4 days with no contact no phone

 yes in what kind of accommodations

 was a seven seven square meter room or 70 ft room.

 uh, no windows, concrete block.

 um, a bed this narrow.

 uh, no linen, no pillow, a mattress this thin, like yoga mat this thin.

 uh, maybe 1 cm, 1/2 in, and that's it.

 and constantly, uh, blinking light, which was a bit annoying.

 locked door.

 there's yeah, the the door was very securely

 locked, i must so you're in a you're in a cell?

 yes, it was a solitary cell, so to say.

 there were no other people there.

 so they put you in solitary confinement.

 you could say that.

 yes.

 well, sounds like that's what it is.

 well, it wasn't a prison or or or jail.

 it wasn't.

 well, if there's a locked door, no pillow, but legally speaking, it wasn't.

 yeah.

 legally speaking, so legally speaking,

 why were you being held against your will by the french government?

 did you ever in the first four days were did they make it clear to you?

 so i understood that they were worried about the alleged

 um

 lack of response

 from telegram towards

 the judicial requests coming from france

 which turned out to be not true because we've never received a single

 legally binding legal request coming from france.

 so i was even more confused and

 i i asked the the french policeman, why haven't you been

 following the european law and

 serving your legal request in the way prescribed by this law, right?

 it's defined by the digital services act and it's it's it's there.

 it's you can google the process.

 you you can read the privacy policy of telegram.

 it's easily accessible on the website.

 so why didn't you do it?

 and they didn't answer

 but thanks god they started to do it and and then they started to receive responses

 helping them to identify criminal suspects

 meaning we would disclose ip address and phone number

 of

 people

 who were suspects in criminal investigations

 when we received court orders

 signed by a judge right and this was something that we had in place

 since a year ago before that so it's it's not something that the french

 have forced us to do.

 it's something that we already had in place.

 we had a company in belgium processing these requests.

 other countries have successfully been using this process.

 but somehow the french have ignored it completely.

 and this is why you know i was very surprised why haven't you been doing this?

 why?

 but this is the process.

 and and to be clear, i mean i think this is like standard for social media

 companies.

 a company

 whether it's facebook

 or x

 or

 snapchat

 or any of them get a court order

 from a

 country

 in which

 they have users

 and the court order says

 you know we have reasonably

 this person's a criminal can we have the ip address

 i think they all comply

 with that

 correct

 yes

 well it's the dsa law

 if you don't comply with it

 you can be

 fined you can be banned

 well it's a question whether you want to continue

 providing your service in the european union but it's only

 concerns it only concerns

 the identification data meaning ip address and in some

 cases phone number of the suspect.

 it has nothing to do with for example

 private messages of a person or other kinds of activity

 which is much more protected

 much more private even if we wanted to we wouldn't be able to disclose this information

 but it's not required by the law.

 yes.

 but what you're describing is

 like the state of play across europe anyway for all the companies.

 exactly.

 okay.

 so, but

 because this is like a normal thing that's already take it's a process that everyone recognizes

 and it's been ongoing.

 you must be very confused

 as to why you're being held in this jail that they're not calling a jail.

 were you confus like were you worried?

 it was very hard to i stepped off an airplane

 and a bunch of cops showed up,

 took

 my phone

 away

 and threw me in the back of a car and

 took me to a

 cell

 even

 if they pretended

 it was not a jail but wouldn't let me out and lock the door

 for 4 days without

 being able to contact my family.

 i'd be concerned.

 were were you concerned?

 that was very surprising.

 i was shocked.

 i was you're very diplomatic.

 you know, at first i thought there was some mis mistake.

 they they got the wrong guy.

 like i thought like they list they read the list of charges.

 they have nothing to do with these crimes like organized crimes, selling drugs, all those things.

 like what do i have to do with that?

 then i realized it's it's serious because they're not letting me out.

 they keep

 keep

 me there

 in this in this okay, but just for perspective, so you've got a billion users.

 it's a multi-billion dollar company.

 you started the company.

 you own the company.

 it's a huge company.

 it's one of the biggest social media companies in the world.

 um and so there's a process.

 so if they think the telegram is doing something wrong,

 they send letters to your general counsel

 or

 maybe get your phone number, which i'm sure they could pretty easily

 get.

 french intelligence, i'm sure, has everybody's phone number, and just call you and tell you.

 i've never heard of a ceo of a multi-billion dollar company

 getting arrested at the airport for

 on

 grounds like this.

 well, you're very right.

 it never happened before.

 it's like completely it's unprecedented.

 outrageous.

 it's unprecedented, right?

 never.

 so, it's something that i think was very unnecessary

 because on top of what you just described, i'm also a french citizen.

 so, in how did you wind up because you're not from france originally?

 yeah, i'm not from france originally,

 but i have certain ties to france and and i was awarded

 so to say this

 citizenship for

 using a specific process

 which took several years, but

 i didn't cut any corners

 like i had to pass the french exam

 test like if i had to do certain things that you'd normally do

 when you're because you wanted to be a french citizen.

 i wanted i like i love the country.

 it's a great country.

 it's a great culture.

 of course, these events

 are alarming

 and that's why i think it makes sense to speak about them.

 um, and and

 the most interesting part of it is that every french citizen has

 his or her personal home address

 in the passport.

 so, the authorities

 of france

 know very well how to reach out to this person

 like it's

 he's

 there or

 she's there.

 and on top of that, the consulate of france

 is located in the same building as the tilgrim office

 in dubai.

 so the same building.

 the same building.

 like you remember i've been to the building.

 it's not a huge building by the way.

 no, not really.

 and it it's just two floors below.

 so two floors from the french consulate.

 we're two floors from the french consulate.

 and i was a frequent visitor to the consulate.

 and whenever any

 french agency authority or like representative of of france of the government wanted to see me,

 they had no issue whatsoever

 arranging such meetings and these meetings took place.

 i was happy just to go two floors

 below the my office

 and have a conversation or invite them to to our office.

 so it's very very strange what happened because it could have been resolved by

 different means if you think well

 obviously they went way out of their way to humiliate you

 to issue they announced that they arrested you.

 i mean you were not obviously

 scanning google for news stories about yourself cuz you didn't you couldn't.

 they couldn't.

 but the rest of us were and they announced we've arrested

 paul durov and

 arm sales or drug sales or kitty porn or i mean who knows like horrible

 it's like what?

 um so they were trying to terrify you and humiliate you.

 obviously this is something that was also very unusual.

 so what my lawyers told me here in france that normally

 the prosecutor's

 office

 is not that public.

 they're not issuing press statements every day and they're not commenting on their investigations

 which was not the case with me where they were very active.

 they were trying to have you read the

 have you gone back

 so you were of course you were locked

 up and

 you couldn't

 read the coverage

 but have you gone back and read it

 for the those four days when you were being held?

 well, i when i was in police custody, i heard from one of the policemen.

 he told me every newspaper in the world is covering this and is mentioning you.

 and i said, "what's going on?" he said, "well, a lot of people are supportive."

 but i asked him, "what do newspapers write about this case?" and he told me, "everything

 but truth."

 and i freaked out at that moment, like everything but truth.

 seriously.

 and when i went when went

 um

 this four days ended

 and i was can i just ask like what what was your family doing?

 and you've got children and parents and like what were

 to be honest this is the hardest part because i'm pretty

 stress resilient so i can take care of myself

 but being there locked there thinking about what's going on with my mom.

 you know she's she's very ill.

 she's very elderly.

 she was very worried as i learned after

 what's going on with with my kids and and

 this is something that gets to you and

 and you couldn't contact them.

 no, there's no way because you don't have access to

 any device

 or you you can't even read anything.

 what did they think was going on?

 they were very surprised and very confused and very worried.

 everybody wants to feel secure at home.

 it's your castle.

 there's nothing like going to sleep with a complete sense of safety.

 that's why you sleep soundly.

 that's why we cannot speak highly enough of simply safe.

 most security systems take action only after someone breaks into your house.

 that's a little late.

 simply safe's new active guard outdoor protection feature helps stop breakins before they occur.

 and that gives you peace of mind,

 and it means you won't have to sleep with a baseball bat or loaded handgun

 on your bedside, though you might want to.

 anyway, here's how it works.

 if something suspicious happens outside your property, cameras and live monitoring agents will detect it.

 they'll speak to the intruder, turn on spotlights, and can call the police if necessary.

 it's no surprise that cnet named simplysafe the best home security system of 2025.

 over 4 million americans trust it because it's preemptive.

 monitoring plans start around $1 per day.

 there are no hidden fees.

 60-day money back guarantee.

 just for perspective, those who don't know your story, i won't tell the whole story.

 it's an amazing story.

 we

 did an

 interview

 with

 you

 maybe

 a year

 and a half

 ago

 in

 which

 you

 told

 your

 story.

 you're russian as people can probably hear in your voice

 and sound like you're pretty happy in russia, successful in russia.

 you had to leave russia for political reasons.

 the government was trying to use your company for its own purposes.

 you didn't want to be used.

 you left your own country

 um and moved well moved around and but wound up in dubai and france.

 were you ever arrested by putin?

 no.

 no.

 okay.

 just to put a finer point on this, i mean i'm not, you know, defending putin.

 but you were arrested by the french government in the free west.

 did that did you ever kind of see the irony there?

 that was the most unexpected

 place to get arrested in for me because before in this trip i visited

 several countries.

 some of these countries are considered in the west to be autocratic or authoritarian.

 but i had

 and and and tilgrim is very very popular in these countries i visited

 before coming to paris.

 and i had zero issues whatsoever despite the fact that tilgrim does zero

 censorship in terms of political speech

 and tilgrim provides 100%

 privacy and and confidentiality

 to its users in all these places.

 so you do not extract personal information from your users unlike our company.

 yes.

 we never do that.

 okay.

 but other companies i mean facebook is

 i mean meta is very rich because they extract that personal data.

 right.

 that's a business model.

 yes.

 that's true.

 but i'm not attacking them.

 sorry i am attacking them.

 but but that's what they do.

 and you don't do that.

 yes.

 we don't have to do that.

 we

 came up with ways to monetize telegram without having to abuse people's personal data this way.

 so, telegram became profitable last year and very profitable more than half a billion

 dollars in profit

 without having to rely on methods like this

 when you have to extract personal data and then

 use it for

 targeting ads for example.

 we have very successful sub subscription paid subscription service on telegram.

 we have, you know, we monetize in in ways that are consistent with our values

 that are voluntary.

 i mean, your users have to sign up for the things yes.

 that make you money, not just stealing their data from them.

 exactly.

 and and the service is free and we just crossed 1 billion monthly user

 threshold or milestone.

 congratulations.

 thank you.

 so,

 it's it's growing very

 fast and we're

 very happy with what we

 we're very

 proud with what we do

 because if you look at any

 mobile

 messaging app

 right now and we're number two

 after you can guess which other app

 we're the second most popular messaging app in the world.

 but most of the features that you use

 on a modern messaging app

 first appeared

 first were created by telegram and then they were borrowed.

 we

 came up with a list of like

 100

 such features

 and those are not

 like

 small

 things.

 those are basic things that you know in every modern messaging app like the way

 you

 respond to messages,

 the way you share links, the way you share documents,

 the the text formatting,

 many many many things like dozens of those

 first appeared on telegram and then three to eight years after they've been copied by

 our rivals.

 one of which is larger than telegram and others are smaller.

 but still we are proud.

 i'm not gonna guess how green one.

 yes.

 but we are proud that we're we've been able to shape

 what the industry is like today and and define how billions of people communicate.

 but it's just i'm just going back to like this story which is

 by the way i love your

 slavic deadpan approach to this.

 um it's like it's crazy.

 i mean, if mark zuckerberg or elon got grabbed,

 you know, at the

 private part of de gaul airport, you'd be like, "stop like what?

 the world is ending."

 but they grabbed you and people like, "oh, he's got a russian last name.

 it's fine.

 i'm sure there's a good reason."

 well,

 i hope it had nothing to do with my

 ethnicity because that of course it did.

 are you joking?

 that would be very alarming because you got run out of russia, by the way.

 i just want to say that again.

 you got run out.

 you'd probably still be living there if you hadn't had to leave.

 so, it's clearly you didn't participate in whatever they're mad about in russia.

 you're gone.

 yeah.

 but it still can make you an easier target.

 i'm aware of that because people don't know my story, right?

 people not everybody watched our last interview and not everybody had where was the out?

 so, i was well, i know you and

 obviously i like you so

 and i like what you're doing.

 i like your commitment to privacy and to the user and i think the users

 privacy

 should play a role in your

 in your thinking about a business and that's what my view and you agree

 most companies

 don't agree

 so i'm on your side

 but where were all the civil libertarians

 jumping to your defense like how can you just grab someone at the airport

 because

 well cuz who knows why can you just do that

 put him in jail for 4 days

 take his

 phone

 like where were your defenders?

 well, to be fair, some people did

 some speak up and and and and

 defended me and i actually there were

 more than 10 million or more than i think a very big number of people

 who signed a petition to free me.

 yes.

 so, it was was a a very very large movement.

 i was i'm thinking more like the united nations,

 you know, human rights watchd dogs like where are they?

 if this happened in north korea, which it, you know, i don't know, it hasn't.

 so, but if it happened there, we'd be like, "oh my gosh, it's stalinism,

 but it happens in france." and you're like, "i'm sure there's a good reason."

 that's you know that's what makes this situation so complicated because

 we have to look at the instances

 such as this one regardless of

 which jurisdiction

 i was born in which jurisdiction is conducting this investigation it should be completely

 unbiased right so it's it's it's very concerning.

 and did they ask you questions about russia during your four days of entertainment?

 i think so, but it wasn't the focus of their questioning.

 the the the the most questions were about the

 um way telegram operates as if it's some kind of mystery.

 you know, we we're a big company.

 we are audited by a big four auditing firm.

 we work with the with the biggest financial institutions.

 so we're we're a big company and we spend millions of dollars

 every quarter on legal compliance.

 so we pay to law firms

 to receive the best advice

 in in order to make sure we don't violate

 laws

 anywhere

 and we are we operate in almost 200 countries.

 so it was very very surprising for me to

 get detained in paris and learn that telegram did something wrong or didn't process

 some

 requests.

 and then when i learned more about it,

 i realized that we did actually nothing wrong because

 the law is very clear

 in in describing the process that should be followed

 in order for this request to be processed and it wasn't followed.

 and that's something that french prosecutors could have found out in about six minutes.

 obviously, that's the irony of it.

 it was like you could google telegram police contact, telegram

 eu

 corporation, whatever, and it would be instantly visible online for anybody who has access to google.

 for some reason, it wasn't used by, right?

 and you have to think that there's like a reason.

 before i ask about that, how was the food in french prison, by the way?

 um there was i think they made some exception in relation to food for me.

 so it was fine.

 i was fine.

 it was pretty good.

 i you know i don't eat meat.

 i don't eat fast food.

 so i was good with

 enough fish and i could do my 200

 push-ups in the morning like 200

 squats

 and then i repeated it because i didn't have access to a gym.

 so i i kept my routine there.

 did you join a gang?

 no, i was alone there.

 you were alone?

 anybody push in your cell?

 um, it's just the whole thing's incredible.

 so, where does it stand now?

 you know, we're in i should say we're in france right now.

 you're still in france.

 i'm still in france.

 um, many many months later, eight almost eight months.

 eight months later, you're still in france.

 um, why are you still here?

 so there is this

 limitation on my travel traveling ability so to say which is called judicial control.

 judicial control is when you can't leave the country

 freely

 because there is still investigation going on and you one of the suspects or the suspect.

 i was

 still

 being allowed to go to dubai and i

 returned last week from dubai

 and i will be going to dubai

 later this week but it's it's a very very restricted

 controlled

 process still

 and what's the idea there since you own a multi-billion

 dollar company with a billion

 users

 that's really f

 like where where

 would you go on planet

 earth if you were going to run away?

 well, that's exactly like my the source of my misunderstanding and my confusion here.

 so where i'm not running anywhere and you know i've been to dubai came back.

 so it's very hard for me to understand

 my role in being here because

 i'm required to answer some questions in relation to telegram every like

 fifth month or fourth month.

 so the other like 3 or 4 months i am just

 having to be here for reasons that are very hard for me to understand.

 what's their argument?

 i mean i'm just confused.

 so no one's actually despite the headlines

 that

 flooded the world in august when you were arrested,

 detained, whatever they're calling it, put in a cell.

 um you were not involved in kitty porn,

 drug sales,

 organized crime, arm, i can't even remember.

 but like the worst crimes in the world,

 no one is actually claiming you were involved in those crimes.

 correct.

 correct.

 okay.

 they're saying that you had

 of your billion users,

 there were a few who may have been doing bad things and you're saying,

 i tried, but i i didn't know that.

 it's not my fault.

 right.

 correct.

 it'd be like saying to donald trump, there are 350 million people in america.

 you know, onethird the number of users you have and

 some of them are using kitty porn or selling drugs or, you know, organized driving.

 we're putting you in jail for it.

 i mean, that's like it's insane.

 so, why are you still here?

 like, what is the claim against you?

 i'm still trying to find out to be to be honest.

 i'm i'm still confused.

 so, at first they said,

 "oh, you failed to respond to our legal requests and that's why you're complicit."

 but first of all, we

 it's not true that we didn't respond to legally binding legal requests.

 and secondly,

 it's a very u extensive interpretation of complicity even for the french

 you know legal and judicial system.

 what i'm what i hear from my lawyers is that it's quite unprecedented.

 they had a couple of really small niche apps that are like 10,000 smaller than telegram

 and were targeted specifically at criminals.

 they were nothing like they didn't even have these companies that they didn't even have bank

 accounts.

 they they it was a a different profile.

 they were not audited by big four organization.

 but it's these companies have been persecuted in france before and their

 founders

 i understand were accused of

 running a platform

 that

 is created for the purpose to facilitate

 crime.

 it's pretty much obvious that tilgrim is not such a company, right?

 so it's it's has a billion users.

 every eighth person on the planet is a user

 of telegram like a regular one and and it's it's incomprehensible

 to assume that all these people like people are criminals and and and

 you know everybody knows the story of telegram

 very well it's not something that

 was built for

 criminals

 however

 this reasoning as far as i understand is being

 used also in our case

 they say that all right so you

 created this app and this app was used by other people.

 they were criminals and you didn't do enough

 to prevent them

 from doing what they were doing.

 which again is is

 contrary to what we see on other platforms like you have instances

 where problematic content exists despite the best efforts

# Chapter 3

 it's pretty much obvious that tilgrim is not such a company, right?

 so it's it's has a billion users.

 every eighth person on the planet is a user

 of telegram like a regular one and and it's it's incomprehensible

 to assume that all these people like people are criminals and and and

 you know everybody knows the story of telegram

 very well it's not something that

 was built for

 criminals

 however

 this reasoning as far as i understand is being

 used also in our case

 they say that all right so you

 created this app and this app was used by other people.

 they were criminals and you didn't do enough

 to prevent them

 from doing what they were doing.

 which again is is

 contrary to what we see on other platforms like you have instances

 where problematic content exists despite the best efforts

 of

 social media platforms moderation teams and so on and so forth.

 it's almost impossible to avoid that.

 but the claim itself just conceptually doesn't make sense.

 i mean, if someone commits armed robbery in burgundy or tulus or nice,

 can president mcronone be arrested for that because it's his country, he runs the country

 and he didn't do enough to stop the armed robbery in tulus?

 like, how can that stand?

 why isn't he in jail?

 like, that that's nuts.

 well, the logic also eludes me, so to say.

 back with the the russian understatement.

 no, i it's so look, here's the inescapable conclusion.

 i think as from a bystanders perspective

 that they do this in public rather than just calling you.

 so we have a problem we work it out or call your lawyers.

 they arrest you in public.

 they slander you.

 they try and tie you to the worst crimes

 man commits

 and then they put you in jail.

 um and so they're trying to sweat you to intimidate you

 um to wear you down in order to get

 into the back door of telegram so they can spy on

 people.

 probably really for political reasons.

 that's the what they're really worried about is a revolt in their own country.

 every government's really worried mostly about its own population revoling against this bad governance.

 like that's their real fear

 and they hate

 telegram because it offers users privacy and that's a threat to them

 and so they force you as the owner of the company to give them the keys.

 that's what it looks like.

 well, to be clear, nobody approached me with the demand to give the so-called keys.

 such keys don't exist technically, but if

 if

 somebody approaches me and says we need the keys,

 you'll be among the first to to

 learn about it.

 but that hasn't happened.

 well, actually the us government pushed you.

 i remember the fbi was trying to yeah.

 yeah.

 because this is something governments want, not just of you, but of all social media companies.

 you know what's interesting?

 in the us, you have a process

 that allows the government to actually force any engineer

 in any tech company

 to implement a backdoor

 and not tell anyone about it with using this process called the gag order.

 and

 there there are certain legal procedures, not tell his own employer about it

 and not yes, exactly.

 if you tell your own boss, you can end up in jail.

 like gag order this actually.

 yeah, this is something that it's on wikipedia in france.

 i in the soviet union or in the us?

 in the us.

 okay.

 i am not criticizing.

 so your employees have a legal obligation to act as fifth column spies,

 saboturs

 against you, your employees.

 well, that's the one of the reasons we didn't discuss last time why

 i didn't move to the us with my team.

 and you got mugged in san francisco on your one trip there.

 exactly.

 but but i i did this extensive legal analysis

 like i asked my lawyers, the us lawyers, what is this thing called the gag order?

 and they explained it to me and how it works and how it could potentially

 be

 applied.

 so we decided maybe not the best place for a privacy oriented platform.

 but here in france, we really don't know

 because there there are a lot of conspiracy theories about it.

 and at first i thought

 i i

 also started

 to be concerned

 like

 what is this about?

 but then when the french

 police and the french judges started to

 send their requests in accordance to the european law to telegram

 and receive the identification data, meaning the ip address of criminal suspects,

 they seem to become very happy.

 they expressed their joy in the press.

 they said, "oh, tilgrim is now cooperating."

 all of a sudden, as if it was something new.

 can i ask you to pause when when they said that?

 i remember that very well.

 yeah.

 that sounded to me like they were trying to discredit

 you

 and were sending the message cuz they were not specific.

 they just said they're cooperating.

 and that made it sound to the rest of the world like, "oh, they broke pavle.

 they hung him by his ankles and burned him with galwis

 until he finally gave up and

 turned over the the back end to them and now they're spying on all telegram users.

 you're cooperating like you would in east germany in 1975. that's that's what it sounded like.

 yeah.

 that's why it's so important to clarify this because this perception

 is not only bad for telegram, it's even worse for for the image of france

 because if you if you think about it, it's france is still

 a land where

 laws and legal procedures should be

 adhered to

 and even in this case if you want

 additional access

 to certain data, personal data, it has to be done in accordance with laws.

 and then every company for example us we never disclosed private messaging data

 to any third party including governments

 and if it's in some country they would say you have to do it

 we would discontinue providing services in that country then doing it.

 isn't that why you left russia in the first place?

 yes.

 so you've been through this.

 you left your own country because you refused to give up the privacy of the user.

 yeah.

 but here it's catch it's catching up because last month

 the senate here in france passed a law basically banning

 encryption.

 this law was

 forcing all messaging app providers to implement the backd dooror for the french law enforcement

 to to fight crime.

 the problem here was fight crime.

 well they exactly because the problem here was there is no such thing as an exclusive

 backdoor.

 if you implement the back door,

 technically other

 actors

 are able to

 exploit it

 and it could be foreign agents, it could be hackers, it could be anyone.

 so that law would have put millions of people or tens of millions of of french

 citizens in danger.

 the their private messages would would have been exposed.

 the criminals however would would have instantly switched to niche

 smaller apps

 not mainstream apps

 and if the government was tried to

 would try to ban this apps they would switch to vpns

 they would they would even become more efficient in hiding their traces.

 so the criminals would experience zero problems if that law is passed.

 is the law-abiding

 citizens

 who would be affected and that's why it's so problematic and nobody was talking about it.

 and asked my french friends like, "have you heard about this law?" like they no,

 they were completely unaware.

 and luckily the national assembly here in france shot that bill down.

 so it didn't pass this time.

 but if you look at the u new project by the eu by the european commission

 published in early april,

 they again

 want to do exactly that to backdoor encryption

 but now on the eu level

 and and that raises many serious questions because

 no country in the world

 banned encryption so far even the the places that you would consider authoritarian places

 for reasons that i just described.

 this it's just a huge threat for the entire population

 to for all users for all users to

 legally force companies to implement backd doorors.

 so i think it's very important that people talk about these things first of all that

 france is not

 an a a country where freedoms are disrespected

 right for for example if people assume that france can now take ceos of

 tech companies

 um hostage in in such a way that you that you describe

 and then extract certain personal data from them using

 illegal and unlawful

 processes.

 that would be a big big blow for the image of france.

 but i don't think we're there because we haven't chip away at this concept of

 the rules-based

 order.

 the rules-based order, which everyone in nato is always lecturing everybody else about the rules-based order.

 there's nothing rules-based about what they did to you.

 i'm sorry.

 i mean, that's just that's might makes right.

 that's we have guns and you don't.

 it's our airport, not yours.

 you're going to jail.

 i just don't see the legal justification for doing this to anybody.

 it was excessive in my view, but it was also a sign that

 um

 again in my view this investigation was not based on

 thorough analysis of what telegram represents

 and and

 what the goals of the company are.

 and again they has been no attempt and they had

 didn't even try

 to

 solve this in a more

 traditional conventional way

 before starting a legal way actually a legal and diplomatic way.

 what did they do with your phone?

 well, they just kept my phone.

 i hope they they

 scrutinize it because there they have a lot of proof

 that actually telegram

 is a completely

 legitimate and compliant organization and we have spent

 huge funds on

 content moderation and legal compliance all over the world since like 10 years ago.

 so they're welcome to have my phone.

 who sells your bonds?

 um yeah.

 so, telgram issued bonds a few years ago.

 we were happy to have the assistance of jp morgan, the the world's biggest bank, right?

 and world's biggest bank.

 so, i just i only asked

 i knew that and i just wanted you to say it because

 just to underscore the point.

 this is you're not like some,

 you know, bellow russian college student doing this out of your room or something.

 this like this like a worldwide huge company.

 it's just absolutely crazy.

 and it doesn't have as deep penetration in the united states

 as it does in the rest of the world.

 so, i just i just want people to know this is not some sketchy deal.

 this is like i can't just can't believe they did that.

 where are you now in the process?

 so, the process is not going too fast, but this is the tradition here in france.

 so, i'm not now, i'm just visiting for a couple days.

 you think i'll get out of here?

 so the i haven't been granted a fast track in my case.

 um and and you know i' i've just seen my investigative judges.

 they have this role of investigative judges here in france.

 so my current status is i'm not on trial.

 it's an investigation

 intended to find out whether there'll be enough evidence to put this on trial.

 so, i'm not even on trial yet.

 there's but you're basically imprisoned in france.

 but i well, i'm not imprisoned, but can you can you leave whenever you want?

 i can't leave france freely.

 that's true.

 uh, so what how is that not imprisoned?

 um, well, i mean that i mean there are great restaurants.

 i'm not you know what i mean?

 it's not a commissary

 with

 guys with face tattoos, but you if you can't leave, then aren't you by definition imprisoned?

 you could say so.

 i just don't want to create this image

 of a real prison

 in in the minds

 of our viewers.

 this is i don't know if anyone can see the cell we're in.

 it's pretty nice room service and everything.

 i mean, no, it's france.

 it's it's like very first world in some ways, but not in its attitudes.

 i'm i'm learning.

 um, so how long will that continue?

 and and you've got

 children,

 you know, and a life and a business and friends and family and

 they're not in france as far as i know.

 though.

 yes, they're all in dubai and i have

 kids in dubai that i am unable to

 not just see i'm unable to

 legally take care of them by signing certain documents i have to sign and

 i've

 you know it's it's

 been

 very stressful also for my mom for my mom

 who is gravely ill and i can't see her.

 um i also have this company to run.

 we have a billion users.

 it's it's it's it's

 important

 and i am doing it remotely now but it's not as efficient.

 so if you if you think about it, france is less than 1%

 of the telegram user base.

 it's it's some something like half of 1%.

 and the other 99 and a half% are coming from elsewhere, right?

 india, indonesia, you name it.

 and it's kind of counterintuitive for me

 that the entire organization is impacted because we have this ongoing investigation here in france.

 particularly given the fact that

 it's going

 in a pace

 that only requires me to be here once like in in in several months.

 um so i do think that the current restriction is

 um very strange and very unnecessary and i hope it will be lifted later this year.

 xxxy athletics is the far better choice.

 it's the only athletic brand committed to fighting fighting for free speech, women's sports,

 and the truth.

 honesty, the truth.

 they're not going to lie to you.

 for example, did you know that 80% of americans oppose letting men play in women's sports?

 that's not a radical view.

 it's a moderate, sensible view rooted in biology.

 but woke corporations like nike make you feel like a lunatic

 for saying obvious things like men are men and women are women.

 that is tyranny.

 how can you fight back?

 by abandoning the companies promoting it and by embracing companies like xxxy athletics.

 well, let's see.

 because first of all, this investigation can't last forever.

 they it can probably last for another several

 months or a year and then it will have to either go

 on trial or

 be concluded.

 you could be criminally charged for this.

 everything is possible.

 like you can't rule out.

 guess if they'd arrest you at the airport, they'd do anything, right?

 that's what bothered me when i was in police custody for these four days.

 like first thing, something like this should have never happened because

 i assumed there were certain

 thorough procedures

 to verify a lot of

 u alleged facts before taking a decision such as this.

 like you can't start something like this based on a in a media article that

 telegram

 allegedly is non-ooperative

 or that telegram

 supposedly has worse

 content moderation

 than other platforms.

 both these facts turned out to be completely false.

 you have to be really thorough

 and examine things before making this decision because this the decisions such as this

 are not only harmful

 for for my relatives or for my company of my for me personally.

 decisions such as this i think impact france as a whole

 and as i'm a french i'm a french citizen so i worry about that as well.

 i really think that out of all social media platforms, telegram was probably the most friendly

 potential partner for france.

 and every time

 anyone

 from from the french government,

 the french authorities reached out to me,

 i did my best to help.

 i helped.

 so this for me looked almost like friendly fire like where they're they're

 trying to attack their own ally

 in a way and i was so surprised that this would happen

 because

 the collateral damage

 not just for me and my company but for the image of france

 is quite significant and i

 talked to many of my friends the ceo of big tech companies

 and they were very concerned and asked me can i still come to france?

 is it like is it still safe to be in france?

 people were worried and and the ceos of the smaller companies

 that don't have a billion users are even more worried.

 they say

 look

 they did this to you and you

 you're very well known and the company of your profile is

 you know

 should be treated in in certainly in in certain different way.

 so, and i'm running a small startup.

 a friend of of mine would say, "i'm scared to come."

 and you know, this trend continues.

 so, i heard,

 but there's the sad thing is like nobody's afraid to go to usbekistsan actually.

 i'm not endorsing usbekistan.

 i've never been there, but i

 never met anyone who's like, "i'm too afraid to go to usbekistsan."

 yeah, i was there last summer.

 it was great.

 i didn't even know that.

 but that's the point.

 i mean

 right these countries that you grew up thinking are

 primitive or don't have functioning legal systems or

 you know whose

 laws are really just a function of the whim of the monarch

 or whatever

 they turn out to be kind of fine with

 what you do or what i do or what any

 normal

 person

 who believes in human rights does but it's like

 france

 or great britain

 like didn't you get citizenship here thinking

 this

 was a safe haven

 as someone who was in

 some sense kind of a refugee

 from his own country

 a refugee

 do you have principle

 like i don't want to share this with the government

 i'm

 leaving?

 didn't you

 choose this country for citizenship

 because you thought that it was a place that was committed to human rights?

 well, the slogan of france is liberty equality, right?

 so, equality.

 so, it's it's something that i strongly believe in and it's certainly something that

 france

 stands for in my

 in my opinion and for pretty much everybody who was born in the soviet union

 like i was

 western europe

 is considered to be this place where freedoms and human rights are respected

 and and

 that's why it was such a shock for me back there in the police custody.

 interestingly,

 the interpreter that we had during this four days in police custody

 also immigrated from the soviet union.

 she was translating english to french and back.

 and after being present there for 2 days,

 she

 said during a break with all the policemen and

 you know, clerks and everybody present there and she said, "i left the soviet

 union hoping i would be in a country with freedoms."

 and and it seems now that the soviet union has caught up with me.

 and

 i've

 what so i was very surprised to hear her say that

 because for me france is not there yet.

 france is still the country that respects human rights and freedoms.

 however, i understood i later understood why she was so sensitive to this because she actually

 experienced

 what life is like

 in an environment

 where you don't have freedom of speech and you you don't have a free market economy.

 and that's why every perceived change for in in this direction where freedoms are less respected

 um is is taking very is making them very very concerned people from the soviet union.

 and i myself

 i remember my life i was a small kid in the soviet

 union but i remember

 having only three tv channels and all these three tv channels show the same tv program

 with the about the communist party

 and i remember having two kinds of ice cream in the shops

 across the city and across the country and no more.

 and then when i was brought to italy as a five-year-old

 kid

 and i could see, okay, actually i could have 100 tv channels

 and some of them even show

 disney cartoons and japanese

 anime.

 that's great.

 i can go to a shop downstairs and they have 200 different kinds of ice cream.

 that's much better that i experienced in the soviet union.

 and i thought maybe these things

 afterwards i realized that this

 systems

 called the free market economy and and respect to freedom of speech and basic human rights

 they're actually very good concepts because they make your life abundant.

 but the problem is i remember this this life in the absence of of these things.

 other people from the soviet union probably from cuba from other countries like that experience that.

 people who were born and grew up here, for example, in france,

 have not necessarily had this experience.

 they take freedoms for granted.

 they think it's

 things are going going to be fine because we're a free country and what can possibly

 go

 wrong?

 unfortunately, the history knows many examples when free societies gradually degraded into societies without freedoms.

 and one good example was last month with this anti- encryption law.

 i told you before about because people were completely ignorant here in france.

 the public was completely ignorant.

 so no encryption means no privacy.

 yes.

 correct.

 it means everybody's vulnerable like everybody's messages can leak can can can it's mindboggling.

 and of course every time something like this is proposed very

 um logically sounding justifications are used to protect the children.

 to protect the children, to fight crime, to

 you know neither of which they bother doing

 by the way they don't care about children

 and they don't stop crime

 or in the soviet union they would say like in mao is china

 and other places they would say oh our geopolitical

 rival is trying to stir chaos in our country so we have to limit

 this it's qatar doing it it's russia

 it's qatar

 so yeah i don't know

 but but but

 it's always some troskyite wreckers.

 it's some unseen force from a foreign land trying to wreck our project.

 so, we need to oppress you to keep you safe.

 yes.

 but it's not easy because now in the european union, you have all these laws

 that basically say you have to remove anything.

 it's actually part of the digital services act.

 you have to remove anything one of the european countries

 demands you remove for the entire of the diet of the european union.

 so if you have for example romania or estonia or any of other of this

 very highly respected countries

 demanding that you remove like most of telegram channels for whatever reason

 you have to remove them then you can appeal

 well it will take you probably several years

 but you have to remove them within like i very short time frame

 otherwise you'll be facing

 fines, bans, and so on.

 how is it not the warsaw pact?

 i mean, how is that not soviet?

 if you criticize the people in charge, we shut you down.

 that's what they're saying.

 interesting you would say that.

 it was in 2009, 2008. actually, i made my first dream trip to

 latvia on a train from st.

 petersburg and something was wrong with my visa.

 so i had to get off in the border town in latia.

 but i had this long discussion with a border police officer.

 well, i seem to like border policemen.

 so border police officer in latia and i started to discuss his life in latia

 after latia was accepted in the eu.

 and he told me this interesting thing.

 and he said, "you know, we hated being in the soviet union,

 but now that we are in the eu, we realize

 we

 are in a

 very similar organization." of course, we're in the soviet union again.

 unelected foreigners are still making the key decisions and you don't get to talk.

 so, it's very funny you would compare this two systems.

 of course, they're very different.

 but still, but fundamentally,

 if you're not allowed to criticize the people in charge,

 you live in a tyranny.

 i mean, what what's the other definition of it?

 i have to be able to say to the person making the decisions,

 i don't like that decision, and here's why.

 and i have to be able to say it in public.

 and i've always felt the problem that you have

 as the person who owns and runs telegram

 is that you make it easy for people to come together online.

 you have the channels

 and that is

 i don't know if you thought this through and you

 you're an engineer when you when you built

 it

 but that is potentially a massive threat to governments

 because it's not simply communicating one-on-one there

 you know people can create their own well

 channels

 just like a tv channel and reach a lot of like-minded

 people and they could potentially organize

 organize

 that's true but one thing that makes telegram different we don't promote these channels so

 everything that you have on telegram

 is something that you have to deliberately search for and subscribe for.

 yes.

 so unlike some other apps that

 constantly

 recommend you content and content sources, we don't do that.

 you open telegram, it's just an empty list of chats.

 if you don't have any friend there and if you

 are not subscribed to any channel, you have to deliberately

 find one.

 so i think we're completely neutral platform.

 we allow everybody to express their voice within the

 the rules of the you know common sense

 and and then everybody can

 decide

 which point of view makes more sense to them

 and

 see if if for example the government is right or their position is right.

 right.

 well that's called freedom.

 that's called freedom.

 unfortunately, it's something that surprisingly

 um faces a lot of backlash.

 may i ask you a question about encryption?

 so, the advances in computing power, well, they're calling it quantum computing, right?

 so, they're just so exponential

 that it's hard even to understand for the non-engineer

 brain like mine, but they're they're profound.

 the speed at which processes are now occurring.

 does that eliminate what is the techn what is the technological state of play?

 does that eliminate encryption?

 encryption will have to change.

 correct.

 the encryption has to change and there has been made progress in

 encryption which is like quantum secure.

 so it's a constant evolution.

 so the the the tools to decrypt

 become stronger and then the tools to encrypt become stronger.

 that makes sense.

 are you confident that

 encryption

 that secure encryption will still exist

 as a technological matter

 with the rise of the super fast quantum computing?

 it's very hard to be confident in anything because

 first of all we have to rely on the computing power of our devices

 to decrypt things.

 of course there are very sophisticated algorithms in place that

# Chapter 5

 the speed at which processes are now occurring.

 does that eliminate what is the techn what is the technological state of play?

 does that eliminate encryption?

 encryption will have to change.

 correct.

 the encryption has to change and there has been made progress in

 encryption which is like quantum secure.

 so it's a constant evolution.

 so the the the tools to decrypt

 become stronger and then the tools to encrypt become stronger.

 that makes sense.

 are you confident that

 encryption

 that secure encryption will still exist

 as a technological matter

 with the rise of the super fast quantum computing?

 it's very hard to be confident in anything because

 first of all we have to rely on the computing power of our devices

 to decrypt things.

 of course there are very sophisticated algorithms in place that

 make it so that you don't have to have the same

 level of computing power on your device

 as in a data center

 to say you don't have to bring a data center with you.

 yeah.

 exactly.

 so it it's it's not exactly like that.

 build a nuclear power plant, buy 100 acres.

 you don't have to but you know it continues.

 so the the

 particular state actors have almost infinite

 computing power at their disposal and they have certain technologies

 at their disposal that they may not be

 telling everybody about.

 so they might not be telling people about it.

 so it's very possible that what you're saying will become reality or is already reality.

 who knows?

 so

 um

 so

 that

 kind of is

 one of the

 and

 i don't

 you know i know you

 have

 well you're legally bound here in france so you're under some kind of

 state control.

 so and i know your life is complicated because of it.

 so i don't want to

 push you to say things or to get you in trouble but

 um it does feel like a a determined government can spy on anybody it wants to.

 that's the way it feels to me.

 do you think that's true?

 well, i think the biggest risk for personal privacy is

 um

 the ability of any state actor to penetrate

 the device of the person, the mobile device for example, because there are so-called zero day

 vulnerabilities on ios or android

 phones for example, that the governments

 sometimes know about and the secret agencies know about and they can exploit them.

 but everybody else doesn't know and they can't defend from them themselves from them.

 so if you became a target of a government,

 it's really likely that they would install this

 trojan so-called trojan called pegasus on your device.

 and i was one of these people

 eight years ago

 that had a pegasus installed on their phones according to the leaked reports.

 been there.

 um,

 is there any way,

 and i think a lot of people are there without

 knowing it,

 and i i'm

 know that.

 is there any way to know if your phone has been compromised?

 if

 what

 you're

 looking at and typing

 is being read by somebody else, is there any way to know for certain?

 for certain, probably no.

 but there are ways to check that and see if known vulnerabilities have been

 um

 exploited on your phone

 and and i know there are some organizations that can help you with that.

 i'll where's your phone?

 did you didn't leave it out?

 i don't use a phone.

 i haven't used the phone for from for a year almost.

 i find oh, france took it.

 oh, france took it.

 but even before it took it, i wasn't using my phone.

 i didn't have a sim card in the phone.

 i just use it to test telegram the app because we have constant product updates.

 i have to test it like at least twice a week.

 but i don't i i'm not a user of a phone.

 so i just want to say again, you're an engineer, too.

 i mean, you're not like a marketing guy.

 you're like a build the app guy.

 so you understand the technology.

 yes.

 because you built it.

 yes.

 so you're coming from a a highly informed perspective when you make technology choices.

 is that fair?

 you could say so.

 yeah.

 one of the most informed probably in the world.

 and you don't have a phone.

 what is that like?

 why don't you have a phone?

 well, i don't use phone regularly, right?

 i probably own a phone, but i don't use phone.

 i don't carry a phone with me because i find it extremely distracting.

 i find it also

 um potentially

 um

 um harming my privacy.

 mhm.

 and

 i i i

 also

 just i i don't think it's a necessary device for me to have when

 i want to focus on something.

 i would rather use my laptop or my ipad

 and and put together some notes or or or some u interact with my team, right?

 so i wouldn't want to just open my phone and disappear there consuming short form content.

 and that's why i don't use a phone.

 i i'm i

 trying to extract this from you for one simple reason which is i think that

 when you come across someone who knows an immense amount about technology really understands the technology

 it's interesting to know his perspective on technology

 like with everything you know

 you don't use a phone

 so i just think you know people can draw their own conclusions

 from that right

 so what do you you saw ross albertch got the guy who was pardoned.

 yes.

 yeah.

 silk road.

 mhm.

 so, he ran silk road and i'm hardly an expert on this.

 i was very pleased when he got pardoned.

 um, but it seemed like no one accused him of selling drugs, by the way.

 you know, you would never know that from

 the new york times, but he was not like dealing

 drugs on playgrounds

 or anything like that.

 he had a site

 um that made commerce possible outside the control of government

 and there apparently were bad people doing bad things on it.

 also

 a lot of good people doing

 good things on it but it was none of it was controlled

 by the government

 and he got life in prison for that.

 that's my takeaway.

 and

 so maybe there will all

 my

 sort of conclusion from this is

 as long as people like you create technology

 that makes it harder for government to control people, you will be a target

 of government action.

 you think that's it?

 well, first of all, i wouldn't necessarily compare

 teleg with silk and i'm not and i didn't mean to.

 but i but the but the idea

 that

 the idea that

 they need to

 control everything that is happening online

 and if they can't they're going to punish you.

 that does seem like a real fact.

 i think everybody's trying to reach their goals and be more efficient in what they do.

 for example, you ask

 any minister of interior,

 any head of police, and they'll tell you, "oh, encryption is a big problem."

 if it weren't for encryption, we would solve all crime.

 they they don't see it two steps or three steps ahead.

 yes.

 and it's not necessarily like some huge conspiracy where

 like evil governments wants to want to take more and more control.

 although that may be the case.

 i'm not knowledgeable on that subject.

 it's it seems to me more like everybody is trying to

 solve

 the problems that they see

 using the tools that they have at their disposal

 even if

 it negatively impacts

 other areas, you know, of our lives.

 you're a very generous man, i must say.

 last question, and thank you for doing this.

 um how long are you going to be in france?

 and once you leave france, will you be coming back to france?

 i don't know yet when these restrictions will be lifted.

 i hope later this year we'll be able to travel to

 my home country which is dubai

 freely.

 i

 um i will probably come back to france because it's it's a great place

 to spend time in.

 of course.

 i had a lot of i have spent a lot of time in france now

 eight eight months.

 um so

 um kind of a full immersion program.

 how's your french?

 it's it's actually good.

 i was very good when i passed my french exam to receive the passport.

 it got 97 points out of 100. but i didn't practice my french much.

 most of my friends are americans.

 but even here in paris and and and and and my french friends speak perfect english.

 so i didn't got a chance to practice.

 u but now you've had that chance?

 no, because i speak english with me.

 it's it's it changed.

 like before 15 years ago, 20 years ago,

 it was difficult not to speak french in france.

 now for better or worse, you can get by using english.

 i'm trying to use my french,

 but

 i don't sound

 as

 in

 i sound even less intelligent

 in in french

 than in english.

 so, people switch back to english with me.

 but you don't anticipate like having to stay for the next 20 years or anything here.

 i i would be very surprised if that happened because you see, i'm traveling to dubai.

 i'm coming back.

 it's it's just obvious that i'm not a somebody who would try to escape forever.

 and

 um

 and it's that this investigation has to be concluded in why one way or the other.

 of course, then if it goes to trial, if that happens, it can take another

 several years.

 but then again, it would be completely

 um crazy.

 i would say if i would have to move to france and live here permanently

 for the whole duration of this process.

 um, i would i would say that the most likely

 i i expect that that i would be able to travel again later this year.

 well, we're certainly rooting for you, pablo.

 thank you very much.

 thank you so much.

 [music] so, it turns out that youtube is suppressing this show.

 on one level, that's not surprising.

 that's what they do.

 but on another level, it's shocking.

 with everything that's going on in the world right now,

 all the change

 taking

 place in our economy

 and our politics,

 with the wars we're on the cusp of fighting right now,

 google has decided you should have less information

 rather than more.

 and that is totally wrong.

 it's immoral.

 what can you do about it?

 well, we could whine about it.

 that's a waste of time.

 we're not in charge of google.

 or we could find a way around it.

 a way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive.

 the way to do that on youtube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel.

 subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video.

 that way, you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information.

 so, we hope that you'll do
