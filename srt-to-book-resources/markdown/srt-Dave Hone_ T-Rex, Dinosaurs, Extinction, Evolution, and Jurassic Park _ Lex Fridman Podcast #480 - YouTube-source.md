# Chapter 1

- T. rex is definitely weird, even compared to all the other

giant tyrannosaurs that are very closely related to it,

because it is by far, ludicrously by far, the largest carnivore in its ecosystem.

- So it doesn't really have competition, actually.

- I mean, this is a Velociraptor skull. There are some carnivores

that are a bit bigger than this, but not enormously

so which were knocking around as T. rex. The skull's the same type.

...toothed crap. But, like, you think about that.

And that's like going to Africa and

going, "Okay, there are lions. What's the next biggest

predator? And it's like, well, there's a weasel about this big.

Like, it's that kind of size difference and

you don't get that normally in ecosystems.

- It would eat those, the juvenile of the herbivores, but not...

- Oh yeah, it's gonna be eating Triceratops and Edmontosaurus and Parasaurolophus.

There's even a couple of giant sauropods knocking around.

- Got it.

- In some places it's gonna be hoovering them up, but like,

how often is it gonna eat... Again, Velociraptor isn't there, but how often

is it gonna eat something the size of an adult Velociraptor?

I mean, they're a fraction of our size and we're probably too small.

This is like lions hunting mice. Like, you're just not gonna bother,

unless one, like, virtually runs into your mouth, you're not gonna try and eat it.

- The following is a conversation with Dave Hone, a

paleontologist, expert on dinosaurs, co- host of

the Terrible Lizards podcast, and author of many scientific

papers and books on the behavior and ecology of dinosaurs. This was truly a fun

and fascinating conversation. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description and consider

subscribing to this channel. And now, dear friends,

here's Dave Hone. Let's start with the T.

rex dinosaur, possibly the most iconic predator in the history of

Earth. You have deeply studied and written about their evolution, biology,

ecology, and behavior, so let's first maybe put

ourselves in the time of the dinosaurs and imagine we're standing in front of a T.

rex. What does it look like? What are the key features of

the dinosaur in front of us?

- It's gigantic. It's almost trite now

because everyone knows T. rex is massive. But yes, if you actually

stand in front of one, you would be seriously impressed just how

absolutely vast they are. So I've got a copy of a T. rex

skull in my downstairs from my office and yeah, I could fit comfortably through its mouth.

So it would be just about capable of swallowing me whole, and I'm a pretty big guy.

- Your body, you could fit- ... in it's, its mouth?

- I can fit through, I can fit through it.

- Wow.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's not even a particularly big one. It's a copy of the one that's

in the Smithsonian, and they get bigger than that.

- You have a to-scale copy.

- Yeah, it's a cast, so it's just a giant mold made and then-

- Nice.

- ...pulled out like the dentist do your teeth, but very, very big. So yeah,

they are 12-ish meters long, so what's that? 14 yards. Four and a half, maybe five

to the top of the head, standing up. So another six yards high.

And then seven-ish metric tons. What's that?

About eight and a half short tons. So a colleague of mine, Tom Holtz,

described them as an orca on land, but that's it. It is a

killer whale-sized animal but on legs, on

land. And those are massive predators. So you're

looking at something absolutely colossal, and I think that is what will

stun you. I think people don't realize how big a lot of

animals are, which sounds weird, but I used

to work in a few zoos, and something I think you notice is when you go and see things like

elephants or giraffes or rhinos, everything's built to the scale of

the animal. The elephant house is huge. The doors are huge. The

bars are huge. The food is huge. And so you don't

see them in the context of something that you have a good

frame of reference for. And I learned this, yeah, when I was at London

Zoo and was going into the basement of the

old elephant and rhino pavilion, and a rhino stuck its head out from like this gap in

the wall, and the head was twice the size I thought it was

once you stood next to it. And the same with an elephant. I once stood next to an

elephant closer than you are to me now, and you go, "Oh, they

are so much bigger than I thought." And I think it's similar in

museums. Like even when you get up relatively close to a T. rex

skeleton, there's a bit of space between you and it, and then some

bars. And then it's usually raised up a little bit on a mount, on a little mount

to hold the platform. And then you stand back from that, and you don't

actually get to stand like under them. And when you do

that, you realize that, yeah, the foot finishes at my knee.

- So is a T. rex bigger than an elephant? That'd be fair to say?

- Yeah, I mean, a very large savanna African

elephant is five to six tons, and we're looking at seven plus.

And a biped and a carnivore. So

yeah, you know, a big lion. A big lion is 200 kilos. So 430 pounds. Yeah.

- Well, that's what, that's why I mean, it's why they consider it to be probably the

most epic predator in the history of Earth.

- Yeah, I mean, and I think more than that, it's I think it's one of the most iconic animals

period. I mean if you, if you're listing things that the average person has

heard of: lion, elephant, giraffe, tiger, hippo,

rhino. There's a few more, but T. rex is coming somewhere up in that

list. That, that's how prominent it is as an animal.

So yeah, it's, it, it's almost inescapable as a

paleontologist. And then doubly so for me, who works on dinosaurs, and doubly so again,

'cause I do work on tyrannosaurs. But yeah, it just dominates conversations.

- Well, some of the other features, maybe we can go through.

- Yeah, sure.

- So big skull, big head, small hands.

- Massive head. Very kind of boxy. It's very robust. Big forward-facing

eyes. Massive eyes. Massive. I mean, tennis

ball-sized eyes. These things had amazing eyesight.

Yeah. Giant teeth. There's a cast of a-

- What?

- ...Tyrannosaurus rex tooth.

- What?

- Yeah, I know. So-

- How...

- It, it looks a bit bigger than it is. So this is all root, so this would be stuck in the jaw. This would be supporting it.

- Right. But that tip part is-

- But that-

- ...that's the tooth?

- The tip, as you call it.

And, yeah, you know, so that would comfortably go through pretty much any part.

- Wow.

- And then you realize just how thick it is. So this is a cast of a

thing called Carcharodontosaurus from Africa. You get it down in

Niger and a few other places like that.

And they're very, very big. Not as big as T. rex, but not a

million miles away. And then if you look at the teeth in profile, they're a

surprisingly similar shape and not far off in size as

well. And then you look at them that way on, and you realize it's

a third of the width. So this isn't just massive,

it's thick. And of course, being thick, it makes it strong. And with

that giant head, with all that extra bone and then all the extra musculature

attached to that giant head, they've got this uber-powerful

bite and the ability to just chomp through basically anything it wants to.

So yeah, they are truly unusual in that regard, even actually compared to a lot of the

other very big tyrannosaurs, they're often a kind of step above

in their proportions.

- So, incredible crushing power in the jaw?

- Yeah. And then, as you say, like this really short, bull neck, 'cause you've got this

massive weight of this head up front that you need to hold it up and not tip

forwards. Really quite a massive body. Again,

there's two or three other big carnivorous dinosaurs which

people argue, oh, maybe they're a little bigger than T. rex, maybe they're a little smaller, but it's

always in terms of length, which is one way of looking at things. You know,

pythons are very long but

they're nothing like as massive as, yeah, a lion or a tiger. Same

thing. T. rex is massive. It is built. So really

big kind of barrel-shaped chest, making the body very, very big

as well. And so that's why, yeah, there's things like Giganotosaurus and

Mapusaurus from South America. Maybe they get a bit longer, another

meter or so in length. But in mass, we're talking about maybe

only two-thirds, three-quarters. So T. rex is just massively bigger

than basically any other big carnivore we know of.

And then, yeah, little arms, as you say. So this is a, not great, but

it's a cast of a T. rex arm. It's not the biggest animal.

They do get a bit bigger than this. But as I love showing, it's not a

million miles off the size of my own. And

I could do with a diet, but I don't weigh seven tons. So

yeah, it really is really pretty small.

- Two claws, two fingers.

- Yeah, so two fingers. You will see sometimes that they say there's a third.

This is a slight misnomer. So you do see this extra little bone here?

This doesn't turn up in all of them, and it's an extra hand bone.

So it's these, the metacarpals. But it's not supporting an extra digit.

- So mostly functionality-wise, it wasn't very functional.

- They're not doing very much at all. This is what's called the

deltopectoral crest. It's really important for big

arm movements because it's deltoids and pectorals. The radius and

ulna are really quite thin, thinner than ours. The fingers are pretty stocky.

The claws look big and curved, and they are, but

other tyrannosaurs, and indeed other carnivores generally,

have much more curved claws. And then they have these

little things, oh, where can I say it? There, there you can see there's a little mark.

That's a ligamentous pit. And so what you can imagine is,

# Chapter 2

- So mostly functionality-wise, it wasn't very functional.

- They're not doing very much at all. This is what's called the

deltopectoral crest. It's really important for big

arm movements because it's deltoids and pectorals. The radius and

ulna are really quite thin, thinner than ours. The fingers are pretty stocky.

The claws look big and curved, and they are, but

other tyrannosaurs, and indeed other carnivores generally,

have much more curved claws. And then they have these

little things, oh, where can I say it? There, there you can see there's a little mark.

That's a ligamentous pit. And so what you can imagine is,

if you're trying to hold onto something and something's wriggling, you want grip.

And there's a risk that you'll just dislocate your fingers. So we have

ligaments that hold bone to bone. And if you just put it

flat to flat surface area, there's only so much you can attach. Whereas if you turn

that into a little hemispherical dip, you get a lot more surface area for your area.

If that makes sense.

- Yeah.

- So if you have a really big ligamentous pit, it means there's a really big ligament,

which means your fingers are really strong and they're really resistant to being

wiggled around and pulled, as if you've grabbed something that doesn't want you to kill

it. Well, T. rex has probably the smallest ligamentous pits of any

tyrannosaur. So that kind of suggests it's not doing very

much. And again, when you look at the claws, proportionally, they're not that big and

they're not that curved. So even though it looks like quite a wicked

thing to us, remember, put this on a seven-ton animal

whose individual teeth are the size of entire fingers.

Suddenly that arm doesn't look like it's doing very much.

- What about the feet?

- So massive. Again, not surprisingly, you're supporting a

colossal amount of weight. But they have this beautiful

adaptation in the foot. So the equivalent bones in the foot, the

metatarsals, for us make up the flat of the feet. But these animals walk

like birds. They got three toes on the ground and then the metatarsals stick nearly

vertically. That overall extends the length of the leg, so you can walk a

little bit faster. You get a slightly bigger stride length. Don't worry,

I've got the right bone here.

- Nice.

- But they also have... Yeah, there's a good one. That one's a great one. But

they also have this really neat adaptation in the middle bone. So you

can see it on this one quite well, and that this is actually not a

tyrannosaur, this is an ornithomimosaur. So one of the really

ostrich-like ones, Gallimimus from the first Jurassic Park. It has the

same thing. You can see the normal bones would be really quite long and

square and then flat at the top. And instead, this thing shrinks in the

middle and turns into this kind of flattened diamond shape. And what that means

is... the bones either side kind of lock it. In

fact, at the top end, it actually tends to wiggle a bit. So it actually goes left and

then right. And of course, what that really does is then help these things

lock together. And so this is an adaptation to basically lock the

foot and make it stable, and we see it in a whole bunch of things,

independently evolved. Early tyrannosaurs don't have this. Early ornithomimosaurs don't have

this. The oviraptodiraurs, the early ones don't have this, and the later ones

acquire it, and a couple of other groups as well. And it's about making the foot

stable. And what that really does is make the foot energy

efficient. So you can imagine, as an animal, you know,

we have some cartilage and we've got some ligaments and tendons joining all the bones

together and holding joints stable. When you push down,

that's going to compress them to a little degree, and when you lift that weight off, they're

actually going to spring back. You're going to get a tiny little energy return. It's the

idea of those air soles they put in all the trainers and

stuff in the 90s. It's that same principle.

And you will. You'll get a little bit of energy return, but of course, big

force, particularly for a big, heavy animal, it's going to take the path of least

resistance. And so if your bones are all kind of loose in the

foot, what they're going to do is they're going to tend to splay out, and you're actually going to lose

that energy. But if you lock the feet together, the bones can't

move and instead, that's going to further compress those

soft tissue bits and give you a bit more spring.

- And this is all about... I mean, this is about the mobility, about the dynamics of the

movement.

- It makes you more efficient. It means you're putting less energy in to

walk, because you're just getting a little bit of spring of every single step.

- I should say that I deeply admire people like Russ Tedrake, like the Boston

Dynamics teams, like the Tesla Optimus robot teams

that look at bipedal and quadruped robot movement.

And they try to make human-like movement to, you know, basically

efficient movement. And so the question here is, how the hell is a

T-Rex its size, bipedal, able to move as a predator? It's a weird body shape,

is it not?

- I mean, the big head makes it look more odd, but you

look at dinosaurs as a whole, and over a third, probably 40, 45% is the group called

theropods, which were all bipeds, so T-Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor,

Spinosaurus, many, many others that people may have heard of, they're all bipeds

built in this way. There's a whole bunch of ancestral groups which were doing something very

similar, including various crocodiles or relatives of crocodiles,

and then the birds are bipeds. Birds are actually doing it in a much

weirder way than theropods are. Theropods are basically a lizard on its back legs.

I'm oversimplifying a lot. I can hear paleontologists screaming, as I've just said,

"It's a lizard standing up." It's not a lizard standing up, but they're doing a lot of the same

stuff in the same way, and that is really functionally about where

you put muscles, because what you really want to do to walk

forwards is you want to basically pull the leg back

so that you're pushing the body off.

And the way they do that is the musculature on the tail. We don't have a

tail, and indeed, mammals that even do have a, you know, elephants and even

lions, it's a piddly little thing. There's not a lot of muscle there.

But if you look at a lizard, particularly if you look at something like a crocodile, you see this

massive, massive block of muscle sitting on the first

third to half of the tail. And that's what dinosaurs

are doing. It's the same thing as lizards and crocs. They have this giant set of muscles on

the first half of the tail that's anchoring on the femur, so the thigh bone, on the

back of that, and muscles contract. That's the one thing they

do. But now you've got a giant muscle. And T-Rex, this muscle is

like two and a half, three meters long.

It's going to be like this wide in the middle. So when that contracts,

the leg goes back, the foot's stationary on the ground, so the animal goes

forwards.

- So the tail is...

- integral to movement.

- ...so it's a huge part of the biomechanics of the movement.

- Yeah, we do it with the butt. So we're kind of weirdly how

we organize our muscles. But this is

generally probably a better way of doing it, because you can get a really long

muscle. And of course, the longer the muscle, the more contraction you can have.

The hyper version of this is kangaroos. So kangaroos supposedly get more

efficient the faster they move. They get so much energy return

that when they're moving faster, they get more compression from the

landing, meaning they get more spring.

- So we should be imagining this gigantic thick tail, big body,

- Oh, yeah.

- ...big head.

- Yep.

- ...and biped. And how fast does it move?

- So this is one of those things that's gone backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards.

There was a paper arguing that we'd probably been overestimating various

speeds, primarily based on footprints. There's been I don't

know how many papers trying to do T-Rex speed. The most

recent one that was pretty detailed I think had it clocked

at... So I think it was 25 miles an hour, so 40 kph was the very

upper end of the estimate. So probably a bit less than that.

- Well, that means it can move.

- Yeah, so that's the thing.

Big things move quick. I've seen rhino and hippo going at

full tilt, and yeah, they're a lot quicker than you'd

think. And at least part of it is simply stride length. When

your legs are three-ish meters long, it's hard

not to cover a lot of ground with a single

step. And yeah, big theropods, T-rex is going to

be a power walker. It's not going to run in the conventional

biomechanical sense, where both feet are off the ground at once.

- So it's not running. It's power walking.

- Yeah. But when you've got a four or five meter long stride,

it doesn't really matter whether you're airborne or not.

- Power walking, so you're never... So, or running,

there are moments in time when both feet are off the ground, and you're

saying likely here one foot is always on the ground.

- Yeah, pretty much has to be for loading.

- Oh, just because of the mass of the thing? Okay. All right.

- You know, that's the origin of cinema?

- What's that?

- It's where... This is Eadweard Muybridge. So the

origin of cinema was a bet as to whether or not,

while running, a horse had all four feet off the ground.

And no one really knew this for sure. And a guy called Eadweard Muybridge,

he was British, but he was living in the States. He was a keen

photographer, and he basically did what people have

seen the Wachowskis do for The Matrix. He set up a whole row of

cameras and set up a whole bunch of triggers and had a horse run through

them, so it took loads of photos. And lo and behold, in one of them, the

feet were off the ground. The guy won his bet. But he also realized that we already had things

like zoopraxiscopes, you know, the little thing you spin with a slit?

So you see the... Right. So he did that with horses. And now you have

a moving photograph. And that's pretty much the origin of cinema, was...

a bet about biomechanics.

- Yeah, it's always a good question and a bet, and there you go.

You're off to the races.

All right, all right, so we're standing in front of this thing.

- Yes.

- How screwed are we, you and I? We're back in the time of the

dinosaurs. What's the probability of our survival?

- There's two big things to weigh up, which are going to be interesting, which is,

would they even consider us a potential meal?

Because we know that animals have never encountered things. Animals have to

learn stuff. And so animals that have never encountered things before are often...

They don't have a response because they don't know what their response should be.

- We should say during that time, there was not something that looked like primates.

# Chapter 3

All right, all right, so we're standing in front of this thing.

- Yes.

- How screwed are we, you and I? We're back in the time of the

dinosaurs. What's the probability of our survival?

- There's two big things to weigh up, which are going to be interesting, which is,

would they even consider us a potential meal?

Because we know that animals have never encountered things. Animals have to

learn stuff. And so animals that have never encountered things before are often...

They don't have a response because they don't know what their response should be.

- We should say during that time, there was not something that looked like primates.

- No. Absolutely nothing. We, we-

- So we would look very weird, right?

- We would look weird, yeah. So, you know, there's lots of really cool records of,

particularly you've got down in Indonesia and stuff,

where you've got these insane volcanic spires, and it leads to these tiny little

valleys. And people go in there, and they go, "Yeah, the animals walk up to us."

They've never seen a human. They don't know what it is.

So it might look at us, and... Animals are fundamentally

cautious. It doesn't know if we're a threat.

So maybe it might just find us weird or in some way,

shape or form off-putting, and so we may not even

be considered on the menu. The other thing

is we might be too small. My suspicion is we're not.

So animals, carnivores typically take stuff that is much, much smaller than them,

despite basically every dinosaur documentary movie

ever shows T-rex hunting an adult Triceratops, which is, like, the same size as

it. And every documentary, you gotta have lions taking down a wildebeest or even a

buffalo. Like, these are weird and rare outcomes. These

don't usually happen. The vast majority of active predation

is on stuff much, much, much smaller than you. I totted some of this up

for a paper I did on Microraptor, this really small gliding dinosaur from

China, where we actually have a bunch of specimens with various stomach contents in them.

And we were coming up with numbers of about, like, 5 to 20% of the mass being

typical, so prey versus predator. And that's

actually very similar to what we see with modern carnivores, and it's not

far off what we've seen even with things like tyrannosaurs, where you occasionally

find consumed bones from prey. So,

if we put the lower end of that as 5% of the mass of a T-rex, we might actually

be okay. If it doesn't consider us worth the hassle, then

assuming you're encountering a big adult and not a half-size one

that maybe only weighs a ton, then we might be all right.

- What would be the survival strategy? So there's a thing that you criticized

as not being true that I, I guess in Jurassic Park, not moving.

- Yeah, it's nonsense. They can see really well. Like I said, like,

T-rex has giant eyeballs. People don't realize

that 'cause, like whales and like elephants, it looks small compared to

the size of the animal, but what you're saying. And really important for vision is

absolute size, not proportional size. And absolutely, their eyes are gigantic.

- Probably the biggest on Earth at that time.

- Yeah. A guy called Kent Stevens did a paper, and he's got a really nice

graphic of it. If you just put Stevens T-Rex,

there, it's the one with the... There we go.

It's the one with the googly eyes. That's a baseball or a tennis

ball-sized eyeball. And when you think about the

incredible visual acuity of something like an eagle, which has eyes

not much bigger than ours, think about what that's going to

do. And we absolutely know, there's been loads of studies on this

in mammals and birds and other things as well.

that basically eyeball size correlates with visual

acuity. And that can fold in two different ways. It can be like general

sharpness. Like, how well can you see a long way away?

So eagles and vultures, it's really important. Or it can be good in low light.

- And I now discover that there's a Nature Was Metal- ...subreddit-

- On Reddit, yeah, for-

- ...which is looking at-

- ...gnarly, gnarly paleo things. Yeah, I come across it occasionally.

- For dinosaurs, let's see what's the top post of all time.

- Oh, that's a glyptodontid.

- An Argentinian farmer recently found a 20,000-year-old fossilized glyptodont.

- So these are giant armadillo-like animals with club tails.

- Interesting. Wow.

- Oh, that's Black Beauty, and that's at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. So giant

eyeballs, they can either see very well, they can see a very long way in daylight, or they

can see very well at night. And my suspicion is it's the latter. I think they're

probably primarily nocturnal, when they get that size.

- Well, not moving might be a good strategy because it's cautious because it doesn't understand

what these- ...primates are.

- Yeah. But I think if it starts coming towards you,

...if you're truly in the open, then you're in real trouble

and I'm not sure what you do.

I mean, the one thing, the one advantage humans have over almost

anything else on Earth, there's a handful of exceptions, is we have

range. I can pick up a rock and hurl it with reasonable

accuracy. Most things can't do that, and

animals probably don't like being hit in the face or hit in the eyes with a rock

at a range because, again, they're not going to know how it's happened or how to

respond to this. All they know is they're taking damage-

...and that's bad. And that might genuinely be enough to do it. I

wouldn't want to try, but again, if I was

dumped on a plain or a prairie with nothing else but a T-rex that was interested in

me, it's worth a shot. If you're in the

forest, I would try and get behind a tree. They're quite good at

turning. There's been a couple of nice papers looking at the mechanics of the foot

and the ankle and how quickly they could pivot.

But we're much better because we're just so much smaller. So it

would be very kind of Looney Tunes, but I think you could go round and round a big

tree- ...yeah, but much faster than it could. And so,

...it's going to get bored or lack interest sooner or later.

- So let's zoom out. What did it eat?

- I mean, you could go for the classic joke of whatever it wanted, but the

reality is the relatively big herbivores that are around at the time,

it's probably largely leaving them alone because, again,

just the classic dynamics of

predators even like, quote, super predators, like Tyrannosaurus, they're still

real animals. If you get injured and you can't hunt,

that's probably the end of you. So you don't want to

tackle an adult Triceratops that weighs the same as you and has

meter, a meter and a half long horns on its head and

it's potentially pretty aggressive, and then even the

big, so the Hadrosaurs, the kind of classic duck-billed dinosaurs, they're

not, they're not present with any like obvious defensives. They don't have armor.

They don't have horns or spikes or anything like this, but they're simply massive.

Again, you know, yes, T-rex has got the teeth and the bite and

even if they're a bit rubbish with the claws on the hands, but like just grappling another

animal which is the same size as it, there's a risk you're going to get a foot trodden

on, that it's going to get off some kind of body slam or whatever. And then even if you

do bring it down, you're never going to eat it. Like if you,

you bring down an animal that weighs five tons, it's nearly your own

mass. You're not going to eat it before it goes rotten. That's a huge amount of kind

of, not like wasted energy, but you've probably put a lot of effort into this and

you're not getting that much reward out. And again, there are,

again, there are exceptions. You've got things like lynx are the classic one. Lynx are not

very big cats and yet they'll hunt adult deer

way bigger than them. Lions hunt things like

buffalo, but they're operating in a group, so it's a bit of a cheat. So

there are some things that do this, but fundamentally, the vast majority of carnivores

tackle stuff that's way, way smaller than them, and that's what we see.

Every record we have of basically any large carnivorous

dinosaur where you have stomach contents, whether it's like

consumed something or healed bite marks, we get quite a, we get a

quite a few. There's a handful of them where there's an obvious damage to a

bone, in more than a couple of cases with a tooth broken off in the

bone, and then the bone has healed over it, so you know, it

got away. They're, they're juveniles. They're relatively young animals.

And that's what they're targeting. It makes

ecological sense. It's what modern animals do for very good reason.

Juveniles are relatively small and weak. They don't have the horns or

frills or armor or shields and other stuff. They're naive. They

don't, they have, you often have to learn what predators are or you have to

learn how to avoid them or to check the wind

or even physically see them before you know, see them kill

something else before you know that they're a threat. And juveniles forage

badly. They're relatively inefficient, so actually they need to eat

more for their size than an adult does. And on

top of that, they're not very experienced at foraging in the right areas. And even if they can

find a good patch, the adults will often beat them up and chase them off.

- You're talking about juveniles across various species?

- Everything. This is just a universal pattern of being a smaller animal versus a

larger, or a younger animal versus a larger animal.

- So, so hunting young, uh-

- Young things.

- ... young things is easier.

- Yeah because-

- Because they're dumb.

- Right. They're dumb, but they're inexperienced.

- Inexperienced.

- But they're often feeding in suboptimal areas. So this

is the place with all the best food. The adults will kick you off, so now you have to feed somewhere

else. Maybe the food isn't as good, in which case you need to eat more of it, so it takes

longer, or maybe it's the one next to the edge of the forest where the

T-rexes hide. But either way, you're stuck there and then you

don't really know what you're looking for and you haven't got the armor, so guess

who's getting eaten? Like this is,

again, there's lots of exceptions. You can't have nature without things like that.

But this is the absolute rule of thumb for how foraging and

growth and predation operate across everything from

fish to starfish, fish as predators, starfish, praying

mantis, all the way up to things like big cats via stuff like crocodiles.

It's how it works, so it'd be very weird if it didn't also

operate for dinosaurs. And as I say, we've actually got the direct evidence for this

from bite marks and stomach contents. They're taking small stuff.

- Bite marks give a lot of information. That's a powerful signal in paleontology.

who's getting eaten? Like this is,

again, there's lots of exceptions. You can't have nature without things like that.

But this is the absolute rule of thumb for how foraging and

growth and predation operate across everything from

fish to starfish, fish as predators, starfish, praying

mantis, all the way up to things like big cats via stuff like crocodiles.

It's how it works, so it'd be very weird if it didn't also

operate for dinosaurs. And as I say, we've actually got the direct evidence for this

from bite marks and stomach contents. They're taking small stuff.

- Bite marks give a lot of information. That's a powerful signal in paleontology.

- Yeah, absolutely. I've done really quite a lot of work on it and they can

tell you an awful lot if you've got the right understanding of the burial conditions,

because you, weird thing that I think a lot of people don't appreciate is

you basically can't take fossils at face value, particularly when you're trying to

get into stuff like behavior and ecology. So between the animal

dying and the paleontologist digging it up, potentially

quite a lot has happened, and that's where it's really

easy to start misinterpreting things because if you just go...

I had one like this not too long ago where I was an editor on a paper, and the authors had

done a pretty good job, to be fair, but it was this discussion of

whether or not several animals were together at the time of their death.

So multiple theropods together in this

quarry, and it's like, right, but there was loads of debris, and you had loads of

things like fish scales and other small bones, and it's like, okay,

but this looks like these animals potentially died somewhere

else, and then a flood or a river washed them into

this bay or a channel or the water level dropped and they ended up

together, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were together when they

died. And so just 'cause you've got three animals together,

what is potentially the story of how they got there?

- So you have to consider multiple explanations and then try to figure out what is the most

likely.

- Yeah, or what can you test with various bits of evidence? So there were

some tyrannosaur-inflicted bite marks on a duckbill

from Mongolia that I worked on years ago.

The specimen was from Mongolia, but it was held in Japan in a Japanese museum.

I was working with the Japanese on it.

I'm not a taphonomist or the study of decay and the history of specimens.

I am in no way, shape, or form a geologist. I did zoology for my degree,

but the guys I was working with, they were really hot on

erosion and damage, and they were looking at some of the

way the bones had been damaged, and they're like, "Okay, we're pretty confident that

the bite marks are sitting on top of erosion."

- What does that mean?

- So it means that the animal had died, and it was found in a it was

found in sand-covered, but in what would have been a river channel.

So this animal has died, washed downstream, ended up on a

sandbank. The sand is whipping past 'cause I've been in a sandstorm in-

in China. It is not fun, and that's starting to etch some of the

bones and damage them.

- And after that, there's a bite mark?

- After that, you're getting bite marks coming in. So that

- Oh, man.

- can only be scavenging. That thing has been dead and sitting out for

days, possibly weeks, before something came along and chewed on it.

- Wow.

- It pretty much can't have happened any other way.

- And you have to take these really subtle signals to-

- Yeah.

- to reconstruct the story.

- But then you can start piecing some other stuff together. So in this

case, the skeleton is pristine. It's one of the best hadrosaur

skeletons out there. It's certainly the best from Mongolia I've ever seen.

And all the bite marks are on one bone, the humerus, the upper arm bone.

Every mark- we went over the rest of the skeleton, nothing. And then the humerus is

chewed to bits. There's bites all over it, but when you look,

there are two really distinctive patterns. There are deep

circular punctures. Remember what the shape of this thing looks like, at the ends.

And then along the deltopectoral crest, okay, it's much, much bigger in a hadrosaur,

but this bit, remember, that's where all the big muscles attach. There are all of these

types of- this is from a different bone, but a different animal, but all these types of close

parallel scratches. And so that looks like selective feeding because it's using its

giant crunchy teeth at the ends to get the bone

off, and this is off a buried skeleton.

then it's got these- actually, T. rex has really small teeth at the front of

its mouth, right in the front where our incisors are. They're called

incisiform teeth. They look like incisors. They're a fraction of the

size of the big ones, and they've got a really weird flat back.

And that's what these are. It's hidden this with the front of the mouth and pulling.

- And that's mostly for eating?

- Yeah, and that's why it's just on the deltopectoral crest, 'cause that's where all the muscles are.

So I always liken it to getting something like an Oreo, and you take the

top off and then you scrape the cream out with your teeth.

I think most people have done that.

Right, but that's what it's doing. So it's got this little row of teeth-

...and everywhere you get lots of muscle, you get little rows of

teeth together, pulling.

- So there's different bite marks for sorting, fighting, killing, and

then there's different bite marks for eating.

- Yeah, so it kills and dismembers with the big teeth up the side-

...and then it feeds with the little front teeth.

- And all of that has evidence? In the bones?

What hunting strategy does it use? Can we figure that out?

- So that comes down to that foot stuff. Um,

they're relatively efficient compared to a lot of other things.

And particularly compared to the herbivores, so that means they're probably looking at long

distance rather than speed, and that makes sense 'cause even though the kind of stuff

we're talking about, like I said, maybe they get into 20, 25 miles an hour. That's

pretty quick, but some of the smaller stuff is going to be a lot faster than

that. And remember, that's a real upper estimate. They're- they're probably not that

quick, but yeah, almost-

- They're just jogging after you.

- Right, but they've got the distance, so yeah, so it's much more, uh-

...hyena or wolf-like strategy than like a

cheetah going for hyperspeed or a lion going for a relatively quick

burst, and it either gets you or it doesn't. And then people

kind of then just go, "Well, like, but that's ridiculous. Like, they're not even that quick," and it's like, yeah,

but if you're hunting something big that's not that

quick either, and so that's a misconception. Like when I'm talking about juvenile

dinosaurs, I don't mean just out of the egg and weigh a

kilo. Like a juvenile Triceratops can still weigh a ton-

...and be the size of a rhino. They're not that fast, and

again, if you get a head start on them because, as I said, I suspect they're

nocturnal. That's the other thing, it's really hard to hide a T. rex, even

lions and tigers struggle to kind of hide in long

grass. When you're three and a half, four meters tall, you can't

hide. Maybe in a forest, but even then, you're probably going to stick

out, and it's going to be hard to maneuver between the trees. We've got big tyrannosaurs

living in what we know to have been relatively open environments. Maybe there's some

stands of trees, but it's not a woodland or a forest or anything

like that. So they're living in the open and surviving in the open, so they've got to have a

way of doing this. I think it's either some combination of being nocturnal, so it's

relatively easy to... "sneak" isn't quite the wrong word, but

approach things to cut the distance down for your initial

strike and then just running them down. Because, yeah,

maybe a one-ton Triceratops or one-ton Hadrosaur is rather

faster than you, but if you've covered the first couple of

hundred meters to get up to your top speed before they start

running, then you're probably much closer to

them. Then will they exhaust faster than you'll keep

going? Probably not 100% of the time. No predator's that

effective. But I suspect that's what they're doing, and it fits with what we know of

their size, their vision. They have a very good sense of smell. Again, that

makes sense at night. It makes less sense if you're diurnal and operating primarily

in the day. You've got to hide this thing, and then we know they're

pretty efficient versus relatively fast but not that efficient prey.

- Well, there's a bit of a debate of scavenger versus hunter.

- They're obviously both. A, because we've got things like the bite marks I just

described, which is pretty much definitive scavenging. Then we've got

the healed bite marks with T-rex teeth buried in bones, which is pretty much

definitive active predation. So we've got evidence of it doing both.

- But can we possibly figure out what was the primary strategy?

- That gets much harder. My guess is they're probably still

primarily actively carnivorous. Because if you look at

stuff that's reliant on being a

scavenger, I mean, the true scavengers, like the vultures and

condors and stuff like this, you have to be ultra-long

distance, very energy-efficient travelers. They're

soaring in thermals. They're barely using any energy to

fly. It's really hard to get very far.

- How far were they spread? Where did they live?

- So the ones we've found, you've got them from Alberta

down to probably New Mexico. There's

some... I want to say there's some tyrannosaurine, so

very close to T-rex, teeth that may or may not be T-rex in New

Mexico. There are similar teeth in Mexico proper, down in

Coahuila, so about halfway down Mexico.

- Mongolia also, or no?

- So Mongolia, you have a thing called Tarbosaurus, which is a very, very close relative of T-rex.

It's the nearest species, or nearest genus, that we have.

genus, that we have. But T-rex is probably

occupying almost all of western North America.

So at times, the east was kind of split off and separate.

- But the entire surface of Earth had dinosaurs on it. Well, most of it.

- Yeah, we've got them in Antarctica. We've got them in Antarctica even close to the mass extinction event.

the mass extinction event.

- Just an insane number of dinosaur species all over the Earth,

just the same kind of variety we have in the animal kingdom today, you just have

in the dinosaur.

- I mean, this is, like, how many dinosaur species were there? I- I mean,

I basically wrote an entire book chapter about this

because there's so many. But this would make the number high, but this would make the number lower,

this would make the number high, but this would make the number

# Chapter 5

the mass extinction event.

- Just an insane number of dinosaur species all over the Earth,

- I mean, this is, like, how many dinosaur species were there? I- I mean,

I basically wrote an entire book chapter about this

because there's so many. But this would make the number high, but this would make the number lower,

this would make the number high, but this would make the number

lower, counter versus counterarguments,

that you can guesstimate almost any number and probably be very accurate or very far out.

very accurate or very far out.

- Yeah, but we should say that a large number of dinosaur species are constantly being

discovered.

- Yeah, so we've named, give or take, in the realm of

1,500, 1,600 valid species. Though that is, not everyone agrees on every species,

not everyone agrees on every species, but most people would be satisfied with that number.

number.

But we also name in the realm of 40 to 50 a year, and we've been doing that for at least

the last 10, 12 years. That number is rocketing

up. Shows no signs of slowing down. There's loads of are-

Like, we still never really explored India very much. We're starting to find entirely new beds in places

new beds in places like Ecuador. Argentina we know has a ton of stuff, but we've never

we know has a ton of stuff, but we've never excavated there very much. Australia,

we know there's a ton of stuff and we haven't excavated there very much. So there's

lots of places, even now, to still go through.

- This is a good moment to take a brief tangent and look at paleontology. So how do we,

how do we find these fossils? What's the magic? What's the science? The art?

the science? The art?

- The same way, more or less, that people did in the

1750s or whenever you first start getting them. There's...

There's... For dinosaurs in particular, but this is true of the vast majority of stuff,

there's essentially two ways of doing it. The simple one is where you have

The simple one is where you have

quarries of particularly things like lithographic limestone, so the printing limestones,

the printing limestones, or stuff that's very similar to

that sometimes it's often volcanic you get

these super, super, super fine layers of sedimentation. And that's where you get these places of exceptional

get these places of exceptional preservation. Whenever you see, like, the feathers, or almost

feathers, or almost always, whenever you see feathered dinosaurs, it's like, "Oh, we

got the skin, we got the claws," and the whole skeleton's laid out. So

Archaeopteryx being the first bird is an absolute classic example.

it's from these beds. And there you find them by basically splitting limestone. We don't

splitting limestone. We don't usually dig for them. It's because there are

quarry workers and people who are already doing this because the

stone is useful, because there might be one decent

fossil for every, you know, few hundred tons of rock you shift. In which

case, you could get every paleontologist in the world there for a couple of

years and you wouldn't find very much. You rely on the fact that hundreds of guys are doing this

constantly. And then sooner or later, they'll find something, and then you've got

it. That's the super easy way. The only slightly more complicated way is you go to

somewhere where geologically we know it's the right age and it's the right

kind of rock and ideally fossils have been reported from there

before. And again, you know, geologists mapped all the world's

geology years ago in quite a lot of detail. There are gaps, there are

places where we don't have the details, but in general we know. And then you

go there and then you walk around and you look. And that's basically it.

- And you're looking for something that's sticking out of the rock.

- Yeah. So you always get the... So there's

this constant, and I think, you know, borderline

myth of the idea that dinosaurs and mammoths and lots of

other fossil things, like, entered lots of indigenous cultures

because it's impossible that the guys were wandering around,

say, Dakota, and the Native Americans didn't come across

some dinosaur fossils. That I'd agree with. It's pretty much impossible they

didn't come across some dinosaur fossils. Did they come across a whole

skeleton laid out on the ground? No, because those don't usually exist

because even if they're tougher, or it doesn't matter if they're tougher or weaker

than the surrounding rock, dinosaur bones

are, you know, in some way, shape, or form, they're lithified. They turn to

rock and they will absorb some of the minerals from

whatever they've been buried in. And so even in places like

Mongolia and Northern China where I've been to, where actually the

fossil bone is quite a lot tougher than the sandstone that it's embedded in.

You can find a bit of bone and pull it out, almost like rub it with your hands and the

sand comes off and there's your bone. They will decay pretty quickly. You know,

sandstorms, you know, sand just etches stuff. The

tiniest bit of moisture, particularly in winter, gets into the cracks. Bones are incredibly

porous. That freezes, that expands, that cracks, bones just

shatter. And yeah, you find shattered bone on the

surface everywhere. What you rarely find is a

decent bone on the surface, let alone a skeleton.

- So there has to be something that's sticking out just a tiny bit-

- so that you can see it, but it's still buried. Right. And it happens. The

greatest one that I saw, or that I didn't see, it happened

with a friend of mine when we were in Northern China

and he went, "Yeah, I can see a bit of a claw sticking out of a hill." And it was

like this much. You could see

you know, less than a centimeter coming out of a hillside. And

it's like, so you know,

- That's the dream, right?

- Dig a little bit, and there's a little bit more. Dig a little bit, there's a little bit more. Okay.

And then the system we were running there is some guys were searchers and some

guys were diggers. So he and I were searchers. We're told, "Okay, you guys have..."

He found it. "You found something, go and look for something else. We'll dig it out."

And so we come back a couple of days later and check in on the digging team.

"So what is it then?" "Oh, it's a complete skeleton." And it was a thing,

a very, very close relative of Velociraptor. Ended up

naming it Linheraptor, so the raptor from Linher, which was the nearest

town. And it was, yeah, the legs were a little messed up

because water had got to them and the end of the tail was missing and that was about

it. So like 90-plus percent complete skeleton, and it had been found

with, you know, five mil, a couple of sixteenths of an

inch of bone sticking out of a hill. And that's what you want, because every

so often behind that is a whole skeleton. If you're looking for skeletons

on the surface, they're going to be gone before you get to them.

- And when it's a near-complete skeleton, you, you did a show of,

Terrible lizards on Stan.

- Oh, yeah.

- the T-Rex fossil that sold for $31.8 million.

- Sight and some of them.

- So that, that's a nice sort of big adult T-Rex. So looking at a fossil like this...

...so for $31.8 million, what's the excavation process

for when you have a claw sticking out, like you were mentioning, and getting that

whole thing out without damaging the bones? What can you say about that process?

- So it depends where you are. It depends how many people you've got.

It depends on your budget and it really depends on the rock.

So again, like going into China or Mongolia, where this little guy's

from, the bone tends to be relatively strong

compared to the sandstone that it's in. That

also, that means that, A, it's fairly tough and resistant,

but it also means that it's really easy to

dig. Like again, I've dug stuff by almost like pulling it with my hands or

like getting my fingers in. Getting something like a chisel or a

hammer, you can just cruise through this rock.

- But like, you have to be really careful not to touch the bone, I guess?

- So it depends how strong it is. So again, some bone

is incredibly strong, some isn't because they've all fossilized

differently. What we're usually doing is applying glue to it though.

There's this wonderful stuff called Paraloid, and it's a special glue

for fossils. And I said bone's super porous, so

it's really good at sucking up liquids.

- Oh, so you're basically filling it with glue so it like makes it stronger.

- Yeah, and Paraloid's really great because you can dissolve it with acetone,

and it basically doesn't react with anything. So you can fill your fossil with

glue, but then if you want to take all that glue out, you can pretty much just

dissolve the glue back out again.

- Very cool.

- So, yeah, what you would normally do is for something, say in China,

where the rock is relatively soft and the bone's relatively

tough, and where we don't have any, like,

manpower and shipping problems, which is a real issue in other

places, you basically map out where you think the skeleton's

going. So in the same way that you were doing it, like, you know, if you can imagine

like a cake or something and someone said, "Oh, put a toy dinosaur in there."

And you've got to find it without damaging it. Sort of like, well, you'd stick your finger in the

cake and just kind of dig until you hit the edge of it and then you go in somewhere else and go in.

And that's what we're doing. We're just going in from kind of all sides. And once you've

hit three or four bones, you kind of know which way it's going into the

hillside, usually. Sometimes they're very weird and mixed up.

And then you can just almost trace the outline of it. And

then you'll just dig all the way around that, which might involve

taking the top off a mountain, depending on where you are.

In the desert, it tends to be a bit easier. But yeah, we've had stuff where,

like the first three days is just ten people with pickaxes just

digging a hole to get down to the right level.

- But sometimes the excavation requires like large equipment, right?

- Yeah, we've used jackhammers and stuff. We've used a backhoe and we've just

literally driven it into the desert and just dug a big hole next to the

fossil. And then the classic thing of covering it in

a plaster of Paris jacket. Strips of burlap sacking,

plaster of Paris and some water, wooden beams if you want to

make something really big and really solid, and just

basically wrap it all up and then take it out.

And that's, again, that's what they were doing 150, 200 years

ago, that hasn't changed. Where it gets more

complicated is if you've got really hard rock that's very hard

to get through, particularly if the bone is fragile. Then it becomes difficult

because if you want to get a jackhammer in, the vibrations mean you're

fossil. And then the classic thing of covering it in

a plaster of Paris jacket. Strips of burlap sacking,

plaster of Paris and some water, wooden beams if you want to

make something really big and really solid, and just

basically wrap it all up and then take it out.

And that's, again, that's what they were doing 150, 200 years

ago, that hasn't changed. Where it gets more

complicated is if you've got really hard rock that's very hard

to get through, particularly if the bone is fragile. Then it becomes difficult

because if you want to get a jackhammer in, the vibrations mean you're

going to shatter your bones before you've even

cut through the rock. So then you might be down to doing it manually.

- And manual is like-

- Yep, hand-chipping it out. Yeah, the other way you end up with that is

like the classic Jurassic Park thing, like, was it the

second scene where they're digging in the desert and there's the whole skeleton

laid out and five or six guys all digging around it and exposing

it. And that's actually quite common in the States. And the

reason is huge amounts of those excavations are being done

on government land, their national parks or whatever, or protected land.

And very often the rules are, you're not allowed wheeled vehicles,

full stop, at all, to protect the environment. You can walk in and walk out, but you

can't drive.

And it's like, well, when we're in the desert in Mongolia or in China or

Mongolia, and we're allowed to do this, literally, yeah, my boss drove into

town, hired a guy with a JCB. He drove

out, picked it up with a bucket and drove it back into town and put it on the back of

a flatbed and we drove it to Beijing. If you're out in a

protected area and you can't, you've got two choices. You

can take it out by hand, but that means it's got to be light enough.

that half a dozen people can lift it.

Which if it's a block of stone the size of this desk, you know, a couple of meters by a couple of

meters by a meter high, is basically impossible. So that means

you've either gotta carve chunks off, so take the head off, take the

arm off and whatever, and you can get it out that way, but it's not

ideal. There's always the risk of breaking, you're losing some information,

and if you wanna make a really spectacular display, you don't wanna join

through every big bit of bone. You want to show the public one piece.

So the alternative is to get rid of every bit of rock you

possibly can to make it light enough to helicopter it out.

- Wow.

- And so normally... So in China, if we hit that bit of bone

going in, we're just like going in round the sides until we've hit

Take the top off, take the bottom off, and just take it so the

skeleton is completely encased in rock and it's as safe and secure as it can

be. And then we'll do the preparation work back at the lab.

- That's heavy though.

- But-

- That's real heavy.

- If you're going to have to lift it with a helicopter and they've got a weight limit of only a

couple of tons or if it's not, then you need to pay twice as

much more expensive helicopter, then you take off every gram of

rock that you think you can-

... to get the weight down so you can ship it. So it, so it varies

massively. Yeah. Something the size of Stan, that's, that's months of work.

You're, you're probably doing that across three or four years with a team of half a dozen

people.

- So can we just talk through? Because just using Stan as a case study,

Stan was first discovered in the spring of 1987 by amateur paleontologist, Stan-

Skekanson in Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota.

- Yeah. But it was the Larson brothers from the Black Hills Institute who dug it up.

And so they're, they're a commercial outfit, so they dig stuff up

to sell it. But they also make casts and sell them.

This, oh, I brought my other... I do have a cast, a cast of one of Stan's teeth.

- Oh.

- So like you can buy casts of Stan's teeth. You could buy casts of the head.

you could buy the whole skeleton.

- So it's a famous skeleton.

- You see Stan in a whole bunch of different places. There's a Stan just up the

road from here at Oxford. Oxford's got a cast of Stan.

- Oh.

- I was just at Lyme Regis the famous fossil locality in the south of the

UK a couple weeks ago. One of the fossil stores has a skull of Stan in the window.

Stan turns up again and again and again.

- So the process as written here involved removing the overlying rock.

...using heavy equipment like a Bobcat.

- Yeah, so we call that the overburden, the extra stuff that's all

the rock that's sitting above the layer with our fossil in.

And when you're lucky, that's a foot of sandstone, and you shovel it out in an hour.

And I've seen guys in South America. There was a team in

Argentina, I think it was my old boss, Ollie Rowhurst, showed me this.

And they took like 20, 30 feet off the top of a hill to get down to this

fossil, you know. Something, you know, it was

probably half an acre in size, 20, 30 feet of rock.

- This is incredible.

I wonder if you could speak to some of these other components: Carefully extracting each fossil bone by

hand with picks and brushes, plotting and diagramming the bones...

...using a grid system at the dig site, wrapping the bones in burlap and

plaster for safe transport to the BHI lab. Some of this stuff you've

spoken to. What's with the diagramming? What's with the plotting and the diagramming?

- So yeah, you may well have seen something like this for

archeology shows or something like that. Nowadays, again,

tech's getting better; people are using drones and stuff for this,

or taking hundreds of photos and then building photogrammetry models.

You just get a 3D model in the computer.

- Or just kind of modeling what we're looking at here.

- Yeah, but where you found everything. So it goes back to that stuff we were saying

about the process of fossilization or the process of what's happened to that

animal from death to discovery. A classic thing is bones being in a line.

So you can imagine if, you know, bones are lots of weird shapes,

but mostly, or at least certainly lots of bones, ribs, arms, and

legs, things like this, they're quite long bones.

So if they're in a current, they will tend to spin in the axis so that they

are facing the current. So if you're finding all the bones are in a

line, that probably tells you that this thing has had quite a lot of

water washing over it.

- Mm-hmm. Got it.

- You're then probably going to be missing most of the small bones because the big heavy bones won't

be shifted by that current, but maybe the small ones will.

- Oh, so you actually model where the bones, where you're likely to find the bones,

the big bones, the small bones...

- So it might tell you where to go and dig further down the hill, quite

literally, but it can also just tell you, "Okay, this thing, there's

no way this thing died here. It absolutely got moved,

so we need to factor that in when we're trying to interpret it."

- Okay.

- Or we've got this one weird bone and we can't work out what on earth it

is. Well, maybe it's from something else because if we know a whole bunch of stuff washed

together, maybe that's a random bone from a different animal.

- Yeah. Maybe that was eaten or there might be a different story if it was washed

like you were describing.

- Any of that kind of thing. So that's where you want to have as much

information as possible.

- It says here, "Once at the lab, the bones underwent more than 30,000 hours of

cleaning, preservation, restoration, and documentation." And,

Stan's skeleton is notable for its high degree of completeness,

about 70% by bulk, 63% by bone count, and the

exceptional preservation of its skull, which has become a scientific standard for the

species.

- Yeah. So there's this unbelievably beautiful skeleton,

Borealopelta. This is a helicopter lift. Absolutely.

- It's awesome.

- Phenomenal preservation from

- What?

- Northern Alberta.

- What is this thing?

- Its full name is Borealopelta markmitchelli, and it's called

markmitchelli, named after Mark Mitchell, the preparator, who

basically spent, I think Mark spent the thick end of two years on

this. This was his job. And he did other stuff as well. He's doing some

other prep, he's doing some fieldwork. But Mark basically went in

every day, nine to five, cleaning the rock because the rock was

hard and the bone was soft, and it's extraordinarily well-preserved.

- Borealopelta is a genus of plant-eating armored

dinosaur. Sure as hell looks armored. This is an incredibly preserved specimen.

- Yeah.

- from the early Cretaceous period, about 112

million years ago, found in what is now Alberta, Canada. Amazing.

- Yeah.

- Look at this thing.

- So Borealopelta is one of the ones where we've even got some of the evidence

of patterning, and it suggests that it's darker on top and lighter underneath. So this

illustration, I think that's, yeah, that's Julius Chattoni did that. He's a Canadian

paleo artist, and so that color pattern is roughly accurate.

- Oh, wow. So this is true to color.

- Yeah.

- And so we can figure out the colors that—

- Well, give or take some very large uncertainties—

- Look at this thing.

- it's going to be something like this.

- That's so awesome.

- Yeah. So these guys are—

- That's hard to eat, that thing.

- nearly armored pine cones. Yeah. Though it's very much the

adult condition. The juveniles seem to be far less, if not unarmored.

- We're back to the juveniles thing.

- Right. So, right, so—

So, but that's why we... That armor is absolutely going to be effective

as anti-predator, but it's probably evolved primarily for

combat and display between members of the species because otherwise if

they stopped you being eaten, the babies would have it.

- This fossil is considered one of the best- preserved dinosaur specimens ever

found, with armor, skin, keratin sheaths, and

even stomach contents all intact. Incredible.

And so for that, he really did the work.

- And also found miles and miles and miles out to sea, or

the, the paleo sea. So this is from a site which normally gives us big marine

reptiles. So predatory plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs and

and then mosasaurs and stuff like that.

And then it turned up an Ankylosaur. Well, Nodosaur in this case.

- Yeah. Wow. This is incredible.

So, okay. Let's complete the journey of Stan to the museum

to, like, you get, you get to the process of cleaning everything, stitching it all together.

- Yeah. Like Mark suggested, you know, this can be

even with an animal that size. Borealopelta is, you know, four or five meters long.

We've only gotten the front two-thirds of it. Yeah. This can be, like,

needle-level stuff.

- That's how you get to the 30,000 hours.

- Yeah. Exactly that, if it's that quality and you want to get everything

open. And then something like Stan, actually really complicated

skull. The skull's full of lots of little bones. The bones are really

fragile. So that just adds to the time. I mean, at least with the Ankylosaurids,

the skull is just this giant solid block of bone, which makes life a little bit

easier. So yeah, they're going to put those hours in, and that's really going to help them

sell the animal, which is ultimately what happened. I mean, Stan sat in the Black Hills

# Chapter 7

We've only gotten the front two-thirds of it. Yeah. This can be, like,

needle-level stuff.

- That's how you get to the 30,000 hours.

- Yeah. Exactly that, if it's that quality and you want to get everything

open. And then something like Stan, actually really complicated

skull. The skull's full of lots of little bones. The bones are really

fragile. So that just adds to the time. I mean, at least with the Ankylosaurids,

the skull is just this giant solid block of bone, which makes life a little bit

easier. So yeah, they're going to put those hours in, and that's really going to help them

sell the animal, which is ultimately what happened. I mean, Stan sat in the Black Hills

Institute for decades. I mean, '87, and they sold it in like

2020, so they had it for 30

years sitting in their kind of little museum. And then my

understanding was basically the brothers broke the company up and that's why

they sold it.

- Yeah. But it was still incredibly surprising that it was sold for 31 million.

- Yeah. I mean, far more than I think anyone thought it was going to. I mean,

I, I liken... Well, you know, if you're not buying, like, teeth or an ammonite in

some small fossil shop, you know, when you're talking about things like whole dinosaurs and whole

tyrannosaurs, I think it's a bit like the art market in it's worth

what people will pay for it. And so, you know-

... plenty of T-rexes had sold for a few million dollars and therefore everyone thought it

would, might be five. You know, ten would be an absurd

sum of money. And then yeah, it, it went for

30 and it's like, "Okay, well... Two." I was going to say, someone

wanted it that bad, but clearly not two people wanted it that bad, because if only one guy is

prepared to bid 30, then it goes for, you know, a million more than the

next highest bidder. But presumably, two people, if not three, bid

it to get that high.

- Yeah, it was anonymous at the time, but now it's Abu Dhabi's Department of

Culture and Tourism came out that they were the ones.

- I know they've got it.

- And that record has since been beaten, apparently, by, uh...

- by Apex, the Stegosaurus, which I still haven't

seen, though a friend of mine has sent me some photos of this thing.

- Is it impressive to you, this thing?

- No, not especially. That's why I can't imagine that it sold for that much. It's a

really nice Stegosaurus. It's a pretty big Stegosaurus.

- Well preserved.

- I've seen other very good Stegosaurus, and I don't understand why that's worth

that much more than something like Stan. But it shows you the

market. So, we're here in London. There's a Stegosaurus called Sophie in the

Natural History Museum in London. Sophie is a young

animal, so she's not very big. I mean, it's a sizable specimen. I'd

say five-ish, six meters, off the top of my head, total length.

But Sophie's truly exceptional. There's a couple of

plates missing, a handful of ribs, a couple of bones in the tail. I

think a couple of toe bones. This is, by far, the most complete

stegosaurus out there.

- Wow.

- That sold for, I think, 250,000 pounds, so maybe

$400,000, about a decade ago. So this has now gone up, like, 100-fold

for an animal which is quite a bit bigger but is way less complete.

So, for me, those two things kind of balance out

because size is always impressive, and that's what the public likes, but also a complete

one is better than a half a one or two-thirds of one. So yeah. So how has

the price gone up 100 times, or from 400,000 to 40,000,000 in 10 years

for roughly the same thing?

- A T-rex is a little bit more epic than

- Well, that's the thing.

- a Stegosaurus.

- T-rex has a massive premium on it,

because it's, yeah, a Stegosaurus is one of those

top-tier, you know, it's... You can virtually do the list.

You know, T-rex, Triceratops, Diplodocus, Brontosaurus, Stegosaurus. It's

in that first six or seven. Okay, these days, Velociraptor, thanks to

Jurassic Park. But it's... Right, there's the list of seven

or eight things that any random human

who doesn't care about dinosaurs and doesn't know anything about dinosaurs, but they've probably heard of them.

You know, Stegosaurus is in that list and would have an idea of what it looked like.

Oh yeah, it's got like the big stuff stuck along the back. You'd get that answer

from almost any, you know, 99% of people on the

street. But yeah, it's not a T-rex. So how it's worth, yeah, 50% more

So how is it worth 50% more, and it's not even a particularly complete skeleton, to my

understanding? I don't get it.

- Actually, since we're on the topic of money, if I gave you, let's

say, $10 billion, how would you spend it? I'd force you to spend it

on dinosaur-related things. How would you spend it?

- I mean, I'd probably drop half a billion or so on the best museum you'd ever seen.

- So, put together a museum. You're like one of the great communicators.

One of the great scientists, and so you would want to push forward the whole field.

- Yeah.

- And one of the ways to do that is a great museum, actually.

- Yeah, but you want to... So it's twofold because,

yeah, there's the communication and the education part of it, which is something I'm massive on,

and I think research is pointless if you don't communicate it at some

level. I'm not saying everyone needs to communicate everything. If you're working on the

nuances of a calculation of the volume of a black hole or something,

yeah, it probably doesn't need a press release or a new museum exhibition. But

fundamentally, we should be talking about our work. But also, you've got to

store this stuff. Many fossils are fragile. They need to be kept

not necessarily in climate control, but at least you want a basement

that is much more even than, you know,

just sticking it in a box in a warehouse somewhere. So you've got to be able to

store this stuff to be able to study it, or it's kind of pointless.

But with the rest of that money, I'd buy a ton of land, like the

quarries that gave us Archaeopteryx in Bavaria and have given us a ton of

other stuff. I've worked on a load of pterosaurs, the flying reptiles from there.

These stuff are mostly

commercially run or just straight-up privately owned and not being

commercially run. Someone's just inherited it, and is just sitting on this stuff.

- So if somebody's building stuff on land, does that threaten the possibility

of discovering something on it?

- It's more that they're not necessarily exploiting it with fossils in mind.

- Presume you have to balance the search efforts and then the land by-

- Yeah, but you know, one billion on its own would go a

very, very long way, almost infinitely, if you're just creaming off the

interest and then funding excavations and supporting scientists

who are already embedded in other museums or other universities or other

research institutes.

- So the rest is for buying up land so that those people can do their work.

- Yeah, you look at somewhere like, you know, Brazil, and there's... I can never remember the name

of it, but there's, again, one of these zones of exceptional preservation where

superlative pterosaurs, fish... We've had a handful

of dinosaurs and a whole bunch of other stuff has come out, and it's just a giant

commercial mining operation. And yeah, when they hit a fossil when

they think they're close to it, yeah, they stop and pull it out and they'll send it to

a museum, and more often they'll sell it to a museum, and museums only have so much

money. Whereas what if I owned that quarry

and then I made sure everyone who worked there was trained and got a bonus every

time they found anything and then I just handed everything they dug

up straight into a museum?

- So there would be some element of a crowdsourced paleontology or...

- Yeah, but it's more that like no researcher ever needs to...

spend money to access that. No museum needs to go and find a new

donor to give them half a million to go and buy this

one specimen, knowing that it might still go, yeah, to some Silicon Valley

billionaire's foyer or whatever. It's like, "Well I own the land,

so it's mine, so problem solved." Like, that's what's in my head.

- It just would be wonderful to scale up the effort to where we can map

out the whole, sort of, story of this time, because it's such a fascinating

time in the history of Earth.

- I've jokingly written a couple of times about

how all science funding in the world should go to paleontology.

And the idea being that, like, if you want to investigate black

holes or neutrinos or chemical crystallography or

panda genetics or whatever it is, you can do that

any time you want. That's not gonna

change a million years from now as it will from tomorrow.

But fossils are in places that erode, and if we don't dig them up,

they're gone. So we should dig all the

fossils up now and then we've got forever to study them.

But if we don't dig them up now, who knows, maybe there's something twice the

size of T-Rex and it sat on a hillside for six months and then the wind

got to it and it's gone and that was the only one that ever preserved. Well,

we'll never know now. To be clear, this is a joke.

I'm not suggesting we should stop doing cancer research and physics and other

things, but it is, we're in a fundamentally different field

where our science is literally disappearing.

- Yeah. I mean, I know it's a joke, but there's some truth to it. And,

on the flip side, one of the things, one of

the hopes is that technology will somehow ease the search and discovery

process, but as you said, so far most of it...

- It hasn't. Yeah, I mean...

- So far.

- Yeah. You know, Jurassic Park '93, you've got that little scene where they've

got the, like, thumper or something they call it, and it hits the ground and seismic,

and then they go, "Look, look! Here's the whole

skeleton." They tried it. It doesn't really

work. We've tried looking for stuff with

drones. That helps you getting into some inaccessible

areas, but until the resolution is probably better,

you've still got that problem of, like, looking, you know, with human

eyes which are binocular, and being able to, you know, just tilt

your head completely changes how you see something in a way that flying

over just won't. I know they've

tried looking... So because the bones are porous, they tend to suck things

up, so actually dinosaur bones can be really radioactive if they're in areas

where there are

things like uranium. So yeah, there are drawers which have lead boxes

around them and stuff like this for dinosaur bones, or just signs saying, "Do not

handle." They're very low-level radioactive.

Like, you'd have to stick it in your pocket for six months to run any real risk.

Like, you'd have to stick it in your pocket for six months to run any real risk.

But they're radioactive, much more so than the background. So can we do

that? Hmm, turns out, not really. So again, maybe tech will advance.

- But for now-

- Right, and-

- ... humans are quite incredible.

- Yeah, we are. But also, paleo's kind of at the bottom of the

pile, you know. There's not many of us. We don't have a lot of funding.

It takes real money to adapt stuff. So, you know, like, we're scanning stuff

with MRIs and things like that in hospitals, but it mostly doesn't

work very well because the problem you've got is, like I said, the bones

take on some of the properties of

the minerals in which they're embedded, which means their

density is really similar, and things like MRIs or

seismic activity is basically looking for differences in density. What if it's the

same density as the- you know, it's like I put some green plasticine in some

blue plasticine, there's gonna be a bit of a join and they're gonna be very, very

slightly different. But ultimately, you're not gonna be able to detect

that through most means if you're looking for density or mass or anything like that.

- Well, I personally think that there's few things as important to

understand as the history of life on Earth.

There's like books, right? There's like a-

or maybe you could think of it as chapters, and then one of the chapters is the time of the

dinosaurs- and then there's a great extinction, so it just goes up and up.

- I mean, that's not a million miles off. I think Darwin had an analogy like

that of we've got a few words on a few pages

spread out, but between them you get an idea of what the

story is and where it's going.

- I think what humans don't quite realize is we may end up

being just a chapter in a book. It might be our

extinction event, self-created, perhaps a nuclear war,

perhaps robots take over, perhaps we don't know.

- Well, or dumb luck. I mean, the dinosaurs were doing absolutely fine until

a dirty great rock hit them and you

can't, you know, Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis movies aside, there's

only so much you can do about that.

- Hey, you take that back.

There's nothing they can do wrong. All right. Quick pause. Bathroom break?

We've taken a few tangents, but let's continue on the thread of T-Rex.

Go to the skull. So the skull of T-Rex is iconic. You describe it as

being incredibly robust and overbuilt.

- Yeah. There's a lot of bone on there. So we mentioned a couple of other

things, like Giganotosaurus, is this, you know, giant carnivore. If you put

Giganotosaurus T-Rex in- That's the one. So that's, yeah, that's from my old blog.

It's not my image. Um...

- What are we looking at, on the left and the right?

- So you've got T-Rex on the left, in orange, and Giganotosaurus on the right, in red.

As I said, they're pretty similarly sized, but just look at the

robusticity. Like, the front of the snout of T-Rex is all

bone. And yet, the major openings, there's a thing called the antorbital fenestra,

the opening in front of the orbit, is absolutely massive in Giganotosaurus. It's like

half the skull. The opening at the back of the skull is much

bigger. The opening in the lower jaw is much bigger. And actually, the

jaw, what you can't see, side to side, is much thinner. So

their heads are the same size, and as animals, they are about the

same linear dimensions. But you can just see, there's just way

more bone in the T-Rex.

- It's incredible.

- So it's not overbuilt; it's obviously evolved that this is the

right amount of bone for the stresses and strains, for what it's doing and how it's acting.

But you compare it to anything that's not a very large

tyrannosaur, and suddenly you see just how much bone

has gone into it. It is a very large... It's an absolutely

large head, but it's a very heavy head with a lot of bone. And a lot of that bone

is there to resist all the forces of all the muscles, because it has this giant,

super-powerful bite. Which again, you can see in the teeth.

- So the bone and the muscles kind of evolve together...

- Yeah, yeah.

- ...to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. So you need this kind of structure for the power that,

...the crush has.

- So one of the big things tyrannosaurs have... And this goes all the way

down to the earliest tyrannosaurs were like our size. Like little diddy

things, like two, three meters long, be a meter and a half tall.

But they have fused nasals. So the pair of bones that,

in us there's not a lot there, but obviously in something like a dog or something like a baboon with a long

nose, it's like the whole top of the snout. And there's two, one each side.

In tyrannosaurs, they fuse together, so it forms a solid bit of

bone. So the whole top of the nose is solid. And then that makes the

skull just fundamentally more rigid and able to take

more power through it. The very early ones weren't super biters, I suspect,

but they do also have the little flattened teeth at the front, so

I strongly suspect the fused nasals, at least originally, is

for resisting that. If you've got a long nose and you're pulling with quite a lot of

force at the very tip, that's going to bend your snout. So, strengthen that.

- Can you speak to the evolution from the smaller to the bigger of the

T-Rex? What were some of the evolutionary pressures? What's the

story of the evolution?

- So tyrannosaurs go back to the Middle Jurassic. Tyrannosaurs were around

for a hundred million years, so from about 160-ish,

165-ish million years till the extinction, 66.5 I

think is the current dating on that. So yeah, you've got a hundred million years of

them. And the Middle Jurassic, annoyingly, is probably the bit of the

Mesozoic, so the whole dinosaur period, that we know the least of.

Just by chance, we just don't have many rocks exposed of the right age that

are fossil-bearing. But we've got two or three tyrannosaurs from

that time. And yeah, they're really quite diddy. They'd

be chest-high to us, two or three meters long, including the tail.

Probably more like three, a lot of them. Little

heads, long arms. They look every other

carnivore going. There's not a lot special to them,

at this point. They've only just separated from their

nearest groups, which is actually something like the ancestors of Giganotosaurus,

actually. They do have the fused nasals early on. They do

have these special little teeth at the front of the jaw very early on. They're

feathered early on, definitively. We have

skeletons with feathers on them that are early tyrannosaurs,

at least until the Early Cretaceous.

But yeah, they're knocking around as relatively small animals in Europe and Asia.

We have a couple from the UK. We have a whole bunch from China. There's stuff from

like Kyrgyzstan and places like this. I think there's one, a relatively early one from

Russia. And then when they get into the

Early Cretaceous, they start getting quite a bit bigger. So someone like

Yutyrannus, if you want to... There you go. So Yutyrannus is

fuzzy. We have three specimens definitively feathered. It gets

to six, seven meters long.

- There's something funny-looking about the sexy, smaller, earlier version of the

T-Rex.

- But again, this is seven, eight meters, maybe weighs half a ton or a

ton. Like, we are very much on the menu for an animal that size.

And it's massive and dangerous. Quite what triggered

them... There are general patterns in evolution of size change, and one famous one

called Cope's Rule, I've worked on a fair bit, which is the idea that over time, things tend to

get bigger, and they do for various different reasons, one

of which is just pure, almost, like, diffusion. If you start small and you

evolve, well, you can't get much smaller, but you can always get

bigger. So you'll naturally kind of diffuse away. Whereas if you're a

blue whale, you probably can't get much bigger, and its descendants will probably end up

being smaller. But there are reasons that bigger things do better. You

can hunt more stuff. You are more energy-efficient. You can move more

efficiently. You're dominant in contests,

particularly with conspecifics. If you're trying to win a territory or win mating

rights, bigger things usually beat up smaller things. So there's going to be

selection favoring them. But then big things don't usually do well in

extinction events, so that tends to reset the clock by killing off the big stuff, and

then smaller stuff does better again.

- So mostly, there's evolutionary advantages, but-

- But a fairly big one. So yeah, it's the classic thing of there's a

day-to-day advantage of being bigger, and that might last for a few million

years, right up to the point that suddenly there's the biggest drought the Earth has encountered

in five million years, and then all the big stuff just gets nailed.

- Oh, so we should probably say, is this accurate to say that the bigger you get, the fewer of

you there are?

- There are, yeah. There's just less fundamental space, you know? There's

more mice than there are elephants. There are more elephants than there are

whales. Like, there is only so much biomass that an ecosystem can support.

- And bigger things are just worse at repopulating in extinction events-

- Right, so they're less likely to survive because they need more fuel. You

know, what would feed a mouse for a year won't feed an elephant for a week. So

if... And, of course, the mice are going to have an easier time finding a few

little seeds than an elephant's going to find tons of food, and then they've got less

genetic diversity. There might be 5,000 mice, there might be 200

elephants, so who's likely to have more genes or who's likely

to have selection acting on those genes to produce a

survivor? Well, the one with five or ten or a thousand times the

population. And then, on top of that, you've then got the very slow

reproductive cycle which then, again, gives evolution not a

lot to work with if, as an elephant, you're breeding once every five

years, and as a mouse you're doing it once every eight weeks.

- What can we say about the evolution of just the massive bone-crushing power of-

- So that starts kicking in seriously, kind of Eotyrannosaurus up. So

that's when you start getting not just bigger animals that are getting to a

comparable size to the other big dinosaur carnivores of the time, you start

getting those bigger heads. But even then,

relatively late in tyrannosaur evolution, so getting into the middle part of

the Late Cretaceous, you see a split and we have a group called the

Alioraminous which have really, really long, thin

# Chapter 9

lot to work with if, as an elephant, you're breeding once every five

years, and as a mouse you're doing it once every eight weeks.

- What can we say about the evolution of just the massive bone-crushing power of-

- So that starts kicking in seriously, kind of Eotyrannosaurus up. So

that's when you start getting not just bigger animals that are getting to a

comparable size to the other big dinosaur carnivores of the time, you start

getting those bigger heads. But even then,

relatively late in tyrannosaur evolution, so getting into the middle part of

the Late Cretaceous, you see a split and we have a group called the

Alioraminous which have really, really long, thin

skulls and they look much more like a kind of, here's a Velociraptor,

they look much more like a giant Velociraptor-ish than a

tyrannosaur. Still relatively small arms but

it's a very long snout. And so this is a fast-biting animal with a

relatively light bite, so it's probably taking really quite small stuff

proportionally. And then the other side you've got the

tyrannosaurines which are the really big-headed

ones. And so that is few ancestral things like Albertosaurus and

Gorgosaurus, both from Alberta, but then

Daspletosaurus, a thing I named called Jiuchengtyrannos in China, and

then Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. And you've really only got three or four

of these ultra-giants, which are all kind of 10 meters

plus in size and then have the really broad skull with a real kind of excessive bite

force. But even things like Albertosaurus, which

is, I mean, a big animal, seven, eight meters, yeah, a ton or

so. They're not quite T-rex but they're definitely more robust

than the other contemporaneous carnivores. So

there is this progression of getting bigger, getting a bigger

head, the teeth get bigger but there's fewer of them,

building up the bone biting and the power. But

with some interesting evolutionary offshoots, in the way that, yeah, cats

are largely much of a muchness but then you get things like, well, like bobcats and

lynx which are actually

quite bulky, stocky little cats that don't have the long tail and are doing something

quite different.

- Can you just speak almost more generally? Because T-rex is

sort of one of the great apex predators of history on

Earth. How does an apex predator evolve? Why did T-rex

win? Why isn't everybody, why isn't there, like, a vicious race to the top

and everyone's-

- I have a problem with the term apex predator because

ecologically, apex predators are generally defined as things that eat other

predators. So a great white shark is because it's

eating stuff like tuna and sea lions which are themselves

predators, so it's a predator of predators. Whereas

people love saying lions are apex predators and they love saying T-rex is an apex

predator. They're eating herbivores. This is not some weird and unusual thing.

They're the largest predator in their

ecosystem and they are a giant one. My friend, Darren Naish, has

moved to using the word arch predator, so it's like some kind of

massive thing but avoiding the term apex because I think that

leads into a... It's a subtle terminology thing, but like-

- An important one. I just learned something new today. I didn't understand, I thought I

was using the word apex predator as meant that, but that's what

- But that's because everyone keeps using it when I don't think they should.

- All right.

- And now you're getting into linguistics and it's like, well, if everyone uses it to mean that,

does it now mean that rather than what it should mean? And then I'm probably losing that argument

because actually you'll probably find way more stuff calling it an apex predator than you will

an arch predator, but here we are.

- Arch predator, beautiful. I learned something today.

- It's-

- But that you're saying T-rex didn't eat other predators?

- Well, it's probably not going to. So we can get

into, though I'd prefer not to 'cause it's tedious, the argument of whether or not there's

these small things which some people have said is a different group called Nanotyrannus, or a

different species called Nanotyrannus. But fundamentally,

T-rex is definitely weird, even compared to all the other

giant tyrannosaurs that are very closely related to it,

because it is by far, ludicrously by far, the largest carnivore in its ecosystem.

So-

- So it doesn't really have competition actually?

- I mean, so this is a Velociraptor skull.

There are some carnivores that are a bit bigger than this,

but not enormously so, which we're knocking

around as T-rex. The skull's the same type-

tooth. Right, but, like, you think about that.

And that's like going, that's like going to Africa and

going, "Okay, there are lions. What's the next biggest

predator?" And it's like, well, there's a weasel about this big.

Like, it's that kind of size difference and

you don't get that normally in ecosystems.

- So it didn't have some of the other big dinosaurs around it?

- Not carnivores. There's huge herbivores.

- Oh, there-

- But there's no huge carnivores around.

- Oh, I see. It would eat those juvenile herbivores, but not-

- Oh, yeah. It's gonna be eating Triceratops and Edmontosaurus and Parasaurolophus.

There's even a couple of giant sauropods knocking around in some places.

- Got it.

- It's gonna be hoovering them up, but, like, how often is it gonna

eat... Again, Velociraptor isn't there, but how often is it gonna eat something the size of an adult

Velociraptor?

I mean, they're a fraction of our size and we're probably too small. That, that,

this is like lions hunting mice. Like, you're just not gonna unless

one virtually runs into your mouth, you're not gonna go and try and eat it.

- So the question still stands about arch predators then, like how

does it, how do you win in evolution?

- Yeah. Well, I mean, so I mean, there's no real

winners, there's just, you know, turnover because ultimately the birds, you know, it,

it's still lost out when things went wrong. And as we were just talking about, you

know, things do tend to lose out when they're big. They're just so much more

vulnerable to extinction. But clearly, dinosaurian ecosystems

had much bigger herbivores, and therefore by extent, much

bigger carnivores than any system we've seen

before or after. Even in relatively sparse

ones like bits of the late Triassic, so when the dinosaurs were really just

getting going, or the very early Jurassic, but you've still got

some like multi-ton herbivores and then you've got

some multiple 100-kilo predators, so about as

big as elephants and lions get today. And then

once you're in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, it is entirely normal to have

multiple species that are 10, 20, 30 tons plus as

herbivores and anything up to five tons as a carnivore. I

mean, T-Rex is probably the biggest of them, but carnivores that exceed terrestrial-

fully terrestrial carnivores that exceed a ton, there's

dozens of species of dinosaurs.

- Is it interesting to you that no other carnivore

predator was able to develop in that environment over millions of years?

- I mean, they're probably just ecologically dominant in the way that mammals are

now, you know. Crocs get bigger than lions and tigers,

but they're fundamentally tied to the water. But you don't see crocs roaming

the Serengeti or anything like that. But

yeah, big, I mean the really big crocs even now get to over a

ton, so those are very serious animals. And I think big polar bears

are in the, like, 500 kilo range, though again, they hunt a lot of stuff in water.

And then things like grizzlies are at least partially herbivorous or omnivorous.

- Well, so there was a very large marine reptile,

Mosasaurus. Did T-Rex ever come across that?

- In theory, at least, the really giant Mosasaurs

are much bigger, in the same way that unsurprisingly whales are much bigger than

terrestrial carnivores now. Um, Jurassic Park

unsurprisingly has rather exaggerated it so the one from I think Jurassic World

is like twice the size it should be. But some of these things were still,

like, you know, 15, 20 meters. But yeah, some of them are absolutely

giant. We, we had one dug up in the UK just a couple of years ago and I got to

see the skull of it, or a cast of the skull, and yeah, it's about

the same size as a T-Rex skull.

- If we take a ridiculous detour before we get back to

science, what creature in the history of Earth would

challenge a T-Rex in a fight, would you say? What-

- On, on land?

- On land.

- I mean, nothing reasonable. The really big ones are gonna be...

The only other thing you can really add is, so, this might be a very

British adage of it's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the

fight in the dog. So yeah, maybe there's something a bit smaller

which is just hyper-aggressive and that would be enough to win. Like, the classic

honey badgers chasing off lions. It's not that a honey badger would win in a fight,

but if the honey badger is prepared to put up that much of a fight and the lion really doesn't want to get

hurt, then, then he kind of technically wins.

- You can't imagine, like, any of the cats? Like, tigers, none of them...

can do, I mean, the size difference, the power of the jaw, all of that kind of stuff.

- Yeah, but going to T-Rex, like, what could reasonably challenge it?

There's a couple of other giant tyrannosaurs, there's a couple of giant Carcharodontosaurs from

South America that I would say are comparable in linear

measurements, but are probably rather smaller and rather

lighter. In which case, your money is gonna be on the bigger guy with the bigger

bite. And that simply is T-Rex.

- And the bite is important.

- Yeah, I think it is, because, yeah, these guys,

the Carcharodontosaurs, they're much more cutting.

And they're really killing stuff probably by

grappling with the arms, because they do have big, muscular arms with big claws.

And then slashing away at stuff. So I think they're probably

doing something more like almost like wolves or hyenas or a hunting...

dog, where they're harrying stuff and slashing at

it and you're basically bleeding them out. ...And wearing them down.

- So what about that strategy? So maybe you could speak to biting

strategy. So a T-Rex

is a, I guess, a relatively slow bite but extremely powerful. What about

animals that have very fast bites?

- So it's very simple mechanics, you know. If you have a very long

jaw, you're going to close faster but with less power at the tip than if you

have a really short one that's deep. And so that really

is it. But yeah, let's say there are things like the Aramins and then there are

# Chapter 10

dog, where they're harrying stuff and slashing at

it and you're basically bleeding them out. ...And wearing them down.

- So what about that strategy? So maybe you could speak to biting

strategy. So a T-Rex

is a, I guess, a relatively slow bite but extremely powerful. What about

animals that have very fast bites?

- So it's very simple mechanics, you know. If you have a very long

jaw, you're going to close faster but with less power at the tip than if you

have a really short one that's deep. And so that really

is it. But yeah, let's say there are things like the Aramins and then there are

things like, you know, Velociraptor and a lot of its relatives, really very

small but, you know, narrow. It is narrow-snouted. There's not going to be a lot of

fundamental strength here. The teeth, very numerous, very

small so they're much more about grabbing

something tiny, you know. Velociraptors eating rat-sized

stuff, that's going to be probably its primary diet or-

- So I wonder if there's a bunch-

- ...kind of diet.

- ...of smaller, fast-biting things that could just bleed a T-Rex to death.

- They're going to struggle though. I remember doing some work for

one documentary and they literally wanted Velociraptor fighting a T-Rex

and I was sort of like, "You do know this is, like-"

"...we're going to shoot some meerkats killing a lion." And it's like, well, you can film it

but no one would believe it because, you know, these

ankle-high things trying to, like, savage a

shin bone are, yeah, I'm sure they'll make some holes and it'll lose some

blood and it may not be very happy but I don't think they're going to win.

- The size of a Velociraptor was exaggerated by Jurassic Park.

- Oh, enormously. I mean, they get a bit bigger than this.

...in terms of the skull. But yeah, they're kind of thigh-high,

to me, like a meter or so to the top of the head, two

meters long, whereas in the movies, they're, like, standing

taller than guys who are six feet. So it's just

massively, massively scaled up, and then these kind of big, domey heads, and

they're not the really long, narrow snout.

- Maybe we could take that, change it. What does Jurassic Park and Jurassic World

franchise get right and wrong?

- I mean, they get wrong a hell of a lot.

- What are some of the really definitive things to you that are interesting that it

gets wrong, and also what are the things it gets pretty close to right?

- I mean, I just want to preface my answer 'cause I always get asked

about this, understandably. It's like, I get that it's a

movie. But if someone's going to ask me, "What does it get wrong?"

I'm going to give them an answer. But I do get people going, "Ah, you're just nitpicking."

"Ah, you know it's fiction. Ah, you know it's made up." Yeah, I do know.

But someone asked the question, so here's the answer.

- I should say that some of the things that I've heard you

describe, I feel like it's the responsibility of those folks to get it

right. I think there's something I really

deeply admire. There's a show called Chernobyl.

It's like they don't need to be that accurate,

but they really... the detail of the kitchenware-

in a room, just to get the tiniest detail right. Who's

that for? I don't know who that's for, but that's for great art.

That's for the spirit of the thing. And if you

focus on getting those tiny details right, some magical thing

happens about the bigger story. If you don't care about the details, it...

the story gets corrupted. So I just wanted to say that some of the things you describe,

like how many fingers-

it's important to get that right 'cause if you do, some magical stuff can really emerge.

And it could become a legendary film as opposed to just a-

- Yeah, I mean, that-

- a summer hit.

- that's my take. Again, I've worked on documentaries where they're

claiming that accuracy is absolutely critical and 100% important,

and they won't put anything on screen that I haven't told them to, and-

then many of those things turn out not to be quite as true as advertised,

once you get around to it. So I'm aware that

even documentaries will take massive liberties,

you can't be too harsh on what is popular fiction. On the other hand,

I am also aware that it is by far, by a ludicrous degree, the most popular

bit of any kind of media that includes my work,

as it were, or something that I'm actively engaged in and know about,

and so whether or not it should have that influence or the filmmakers should have

responsibility, it does. It does have that knock-on.

So I mean, it's simple as stuff as a T-rex can't see if you can't move. Yeah, it

could. I don't know where that came from. As far as I can tell, Crichton just dreamed it

up. In The Lost World, his sequel book, he

hints that there's a research paper that says it, and that's where he got it

from. There's a second paleontologist character

who's advising Dodgson, the evil InGen guy, and he

says, "Oh, no, well that's from such-and-such's research." And I tried looking it up.

As far as I can tell, it doesn't exist and never did. So I think it's just straight

fiction. And it's like, it works for the book and it works for the movie, but

as far as I can tell, it's straight fiction and Crichton just made it up.

If it's buried in some bit of literature, he's done better finding it than I have,

and I've had a really good look and I know how to look. And I've never come across anyone

who's found it either. But it just warps the

perception, you know. Velociraptor, cheetah speed, pack hunters,

super intelligent, giant-sized animals and... okay, 1993, it's a bit more forgivable,

but even then, we were pretty confident they had feathers.

confident they had feathers.

- Is any of that true? Wait, so...

- Probably not.

- The pack hunter aspect of it?

- So that's something I've written quite a lot about. The evidence for pack hunting in any dinosaur at all

is almost nonexistent. It basically doesn't exist. And that's going exactly back to, again,

basically doesn't exist. And that's going exactly back to, again, that

that stuff we were talking about, bite marks and taphonomy and, like, the history of specimens and how you interpret stuff.

history of specimens and h- and how you interpret stuff.

- So, so what kind of evidence would show, like, maybe bite marks from multiple sources?

- So it's really, really tough. So the main one which was put forward is... there's this famous

forward is... there's this famous association

association in Montana of Deinonychus, which is often confused with Velociraptor, including in the books

and movie. Basically a bigger version of this that's rather older, from the early Cretaceous,

version of this that's rather older, from the early

and a thing called Tenontosaurus, which is kind of iguanodontian. So an iguanodon with spiky thumbs.

Basically, otherwise, a fairly run-of-the-mill herbivore. And there are two sites, I believe, for this,

fairly run-of-the-mill herbivore. And there are two

but there's one that's much more important, where you have a Tenontosaurus carcass with Deinonychus carcasses.

a Tenontosaurus carcass

with Deinonychus carcasses. And so the interpretation of this

And so the interpretation of this is, well, this is a group that brought down the herbivore.

And of course, the immediate kind of counterargument to that is, "Well, why did they all die there?"

all die there?"

Like, when, you know, when lions kill a wildebeest, they eat it. They don't all just die next to it.

it. They don't all just die next to it.

Or even if they did kill it and start eating it, and then, like, if they got into a fight and killed

each other, well, lions as a species are not gonna hang around for very long if every time they kill

something they get into a mortal fight and kill half their pride. There's nothing obvious that killed them,

half their pride. Um, there's nothing obvious that killed them but it's at

but it's at least possible that this was something like a predator trap. So predator traps are really neat.

So La Brea Tar Pits is a classic example. The idea is a herbivore stumbles into something

example. The idea is a herbivore stumbles into something like

like tar. You've got your deer or wildebeest or mammoth or whatever it is, waist deep in tar and going,

"I'm dying, I'm dying," and making horrible noises, and, you know, Smilodon walks over and goes, "Great,"

horrible noises, and, you know, Smilodon walks over and goes,

and wades out after it, and he's now stuck. And then the next one, and then the next one,

and the next one, and the next one. And then, lo and behold, you now have something like La Brea where they've got,

And then lo and behold, you now have something like La Brea where they've got,

like, the numbers are something absurd. Like I think they've got, like, three mammoths and one ground sloth,

and then it's like a hundred dire wolves and 40 Smilodon because it's just sucking the carnivores in.

and 40 Smilodon because it's just sucking the carnivores in.

- Wow.

- And you get these really distorted ratios. I don't think that's the case with the

Deinonychus-Tenontosaurus stuff because there's ways that you can probably...

because there's ways that you can probably rule that out. But there are probably

places like this where it's happened. Again, the other one is the toxin one,

whose name— Yeah, Cleveland-Lloyd, so it's just coming up on your screen.

That's another one with loads of dinosaurs. There's Allosaurus.

But we've definitely seen it with... I think this has come up with something

like lions or wolves. Like, they found loads of them dead by a

lake and it turned out... or this pond. And this pond had got some really sort of

nasty algal bloom toxin in it, and the interpretation was the

same kind of thing, is that, like, a couple of deer were

drinking. This stuff's toxic and kills you within minutes. Keels

over, dies. A wolf smells dead meat, comes over,

starts eating it, has a drink, keels over and dies. So it's not

getting— you're just dying from the toxicity rather than being, like,

physically sucked in and trapped. But the same effect can happen, and so you just end up

with a pile of dead bodies.

- So I'm pulling up some stuff here. First of all, shout out to Perplexity.

Super awesome. It'd be great if you fact-check some of this

stuff. So, fossil discoveries, including parallel trackways and bone

beds containing multiple tyrannosaurs suggests these large predators

sometimes moved and possibly hunted in groups. You as a person who wrote

a book about the behavior of dinosaurs.

- Yep. Let me deconstruct that almost instantly.

So it's... because it's really easy, cause this is... My book on dinosaur

behavior, this is just the kind of thing I'm talking about.

So the tyrannosaur trackways of a group of tyrannosaurs is, I think,

four or five tracks total. So it's, like, two from one

animal, two from a second animal, and one from a third animal. That's not the end of the world.

That's somehow how trackways form. Like, you know, the rock's

broken up. They stood on mud, and then they didn't, whatever.

- Just to clarify, trackways means footprints of multiple, maybe, steps?

- Yeah. One of them has got a left and right, and the other two don't. It's very

fragmentary, but I have no... That's not a problem with the interpretation.

The problem is this is interpreted as a group of them moving

together. Well, why? Because

they're going in roughly the same direction. Okay. And they're roughly equal

sizes. Okay. But, like, I've seen solitary animals moving in

groups. A guy I know quite well in South Africa...

# Chapter 11

That's somehow how trackways form. Like, you know, the rock's

broken up. They stood on mud, and then they didn't, whatever.

- Just to clarify, trackways means footprints of multiple, maybe, steps?

- Yeah. One of them has got a left and right, and the other two don't. It's very

The problem is this is interpreted as a group of them moving

together. Well, why? Because

they're going in roughly the same direction. Okay. And they're roughly equal

sizes. Okay. But, like, I've seen solitary animals moving in

groups. A guy I know quite well in South Africa...

I go to South Africa regularly for my teaching, actually, and he's one of

the big guys at South Africa National Parks, and he gives me the skinny on all kinds

of weird stuff. And he was telling me a few years ago that one of his park

rangers had observed leopards hunting together in a group. Now, leopards are

basically not just solitary, they're like antisocial. Like, they beat the hell

out of each other if they come near each other. But I've also seen...

you know, you get... Game trails are a thing, paths that single

animals take. If a female is in heat, like, males will track her down and follow her.

So you'll get one set of footprints, and then a couple of hours later a male will come

past, and a couple of hours later another male will come past. And now you've got three sets of

footprints all traveling in the same direction on the same bit of path, but they live

on their own. Let alone hunting together, which is a massive step above this.

And then the one I've talked about quite a bit in my book is spotted hyena, Crocuta

crocuta, which is the one... There's a whole bunch of hyenas, but this is the one everyone knows.

They're the big laughing hyena. And you can see plenty of

Attenborough-type documentaries of them, seven or eight of them, or even

10 or 12 of them going into a herd and ripping apart wildebeest or zebra or whatever it

is. But actually, if you read the scientific literature, this is really rare. They

mostly hunt on their own. Now they do live in these social

clans with hierarchies and complex social interactions. They

are very social animals. But they mostly hunt on their own. So

even if you find loads of trackways of them moving together or as ...

Again, there's one, if not two, for tyrannosaurs, where we've got multiple tyrannosaurs

together, and that's been argued for pack hunting. At best, that argues

they might have lived together, but it doesn't tell you whether or

not they hunted together.

- So, how can we make a decision on one way or the other?

- So, I mean, I tend to be ultra

conservative in this context, and I think we should probably avoid

saying things that we're not quite confident about. I don't want to

ever go down the, "We must have really definitive, 100% convincing evidence," because this is

paleo and we don't have that kind of data.

But just as I talked about with things like the predator prey

size ratio stuff, there is data we can start to use on living

species about what tends to trigger

hunting in groups or living in groups, and what data there might be from

stuff like brain sizes or other trackways. Or again, we do

have bite marks indicating prey size. If you start finding

repeated attacks on big prey from relatively small

predators, that would be quite convincing. As you said, maybe we

had bite marks of multiple different sizes. Now, that on its

own, it comes hard, because obviously scavenging, you know,

tyrannosaurs are an exception. Most dinosaurs, most carnivorous dinosaurs have pretty

similarly shaped teeth. So, how easy is it to tell

an adult from a juvenile from an adult from a different species that's

just a bit smaller? Probably pretty tricky. I mean, for me, I think

the kind of gold standard, which I don't think we're ever going to find

but you never know, like, you could, in theory, get a trackway of something like a

herbivore with a whole bunch of carnivore tracks coming

by it. We do have a couple like this, but they don't have what I really want to see, which

is if you trace the footprints of the individual carnivores,

and if A's in... Early on, A's footprints go on top of

B's, but later on, B's go on top of A's, they

must have been there at the same time because there's no way they

could have been even minutes or hours apart. So, if you had

that, then those two must be together, or at least within sight of

each other and one's not turning around and roaring or having a fight. If you can do that,

If you can do that with seven or eight, all converging on one herbivore,

and then everything goes manic, well, that's really pretty convincing.

- It is so fascinating and awesome, the like the Sherlock

Holmes aspect of paleontology, like figuring out, because you have

very little signal-

very little signal and you have to figure out the puzzle of it from that.

And like, that's it's, it's just you're brilliant. You're giving so many brilliant examples of,

yeah, if A steps on top of B, and then B steps on top of A, that's a strong signal that they were walking

together.

- I am a bit of a Sherlock Holmes fan, and he references

Cuvier. So Cuvier was this legendary French anatomist,

Baron Cuvier. He was the first guy to posit that things went extinct,

working on mammoths. And he said, "Well, there's nothing like this alive today, so extinction

happens." Which before that, we didn't really know. And Holmes has a

line about, "Just as Cuvier can restore

an animal from the smallest bone, so I can restore the events from

the smallest detail," or I-

- Damn.

- I'm paraphrasing, but I'm not far off.

- Yeah, there's truth to that.

- You, you have used an analogy that Conan Doyle specifically used for Holmes

going back to paleontology.

- I mean, it's obvious. It's clear. It's right there, yeah.

- That, that's how on the nose you are with that one.

- So, okay. So basically you clarified and showed all the things in

Jurassic got it wrong.

- Yeah, we, we, yeah, we got off-topic before we even got onto Jurassic Park.

- Uh, and just Velociraptor, you said that the, you know, the, yeah, the size, the

pack hunting, all of that.

- The pack hunting, just to round off on that, like, I don't know.

Maybe there's actually been some more recent stuff on Deinonychus looking

at things like isotopes in the teeth and feeding traces and some

other stuff that's hinting that maybe there is more going on there,

which is great. I'm, I'm not anti the idea that this exists,

but you absolutely get this build up of the idea that

velociraptors are a pack hunter comes from Deinonychus and I think the

evidence from Deinonychus is really weak, in exactly the way that...

Okay, lions are group hunters. We know they are. Does that mean

that leopards are? And tigers and

puma? No. So why on earth do you think that just because, even if

Velociraptor. Group hunting has all kinds of

more complicated dynamics going on it than just close relatives tend to do

it. You can flip that around, you know.

African hunting dog, wolves, things like bush dogs. There's

various canids that all hunt in groups, but then you've got things like

maned wolves which are effectively solitary. The hyenas.

Spotted hyenas are, yeah, these super social animals, but the brown

hyena, the striped hyena and the aardwolf are solitary. So you just

So you just can't do group versus solitary off close relatives or anything like that. I am very sure

close relatives or anything like that. I am very sure a ton of dinosaurs were aggregates, lived in groups to some degree,

a ton of dinosaurs were aggregates, lived in groups to some degree, and I'm very sure some of them were social with complex lives

and I'm very sure some of them were social with complex lives and hierarchies and even pack hunting. Which ones, I

have very little idea because I think the data is so sparse that we can't really say it with any confidence for

that we can't really say it with any confidence for anything, in my opinion. I think that can be gotten at.

anything, in my opinion. I think that can be gotten at. I think we need to start getting at it with the sort of stuff I'm talking about.

I think we need to start getting at it with the sort of stuff I'm talking about. Like get a better understanding of what drives sociality in lions

Like get a better understanding of what drives sociality in lions versus tigers versus leopards. You know, relatively close relatives

tigers versus leopards. You know, relatively close relatives who overlap. Don't forget in India, leopards and tigers

who overlap. Don't forget in India, leopards and tigers overlap with lions. The Asiatic lion is still there.

overlap with lions. The Asiatic lion is still there. So you can talk about ecosystem structure and prey size

So you can talk about ecosystem structure and prey size and prey type and all this stuff. Maybe we can start

and prey type and all this stuff. Maybe we can start piecing that together a bit better and then apply that to stuff

piecing that together a bit better and then apply that to stuff like the track ways and the isotopes and all the rest of it.

Bite marks and these mass mortality sites. So I think it can be done, but personally like what were pack hunters? No idea.

but personally like what were pack hunters? No idea.

No idea. I don't think any of them were in the sense that I don't think we've got good evidence for any of them.

I don't think we've got good evidence for any of them. But there probably exists on Earth definitive evidence one way or the other.

- But there probably exists on earth definitive evidence one way or the other.

- Yeah, probably for some of them. I mean, I think it's well within their scope. One of the papers writing about this,

One of the papers writing about this, ironically, arguing against pack hunting in Deinonychus, said that, "Well,

against pack hunting in Deinonychus, said that, "Well, it's probably not the case because you don't really see pack hunting

it's probably not the case because you don't really see pack hunting in birds. And so if you don't see it in birds, then dinosaurs

in birds. And so if you don't see it in birds, then dinosaurs being their ancestor, well, if birds can't evolve it,

being their ancestor, well, if birds can't evolve it, then maybe dinosaurs couldn't have evolved it." Which

I'm not sure is a great logical argument because of the complexities of social behavior anyway. But then there are a couple of birds

but there's also sociality, which is such an interesting idea. It's how did they live? And this is something you look

It's how did they live? And this is something you look at that paleontology doesn't often touch, is like, the lives.

- Yeah, because, you know, animals are doing complicated things. So, in the case of lions, a large part of this is down to

this. So cheetahs are the weird ones compared to the other cats because

females are solitary, but males are social. So brothers

will... when, you know, if the female has five or six cubs, the

brothers will stay together in a group and then the girls will go off on their own.

And if you're the only brother or the only survivor, you will usually hook up,

hook up with a gang of other males. So cheetahs are pack hunters if you're male

and a solitary hunter if you're female. So it's not about

territory defense or occupation for them. It's about prey type.

- Is it possible to know the sex of a T-Rex or any of the

other dinosaurs? What can paleontology show us?

- So in theory, yes. In practice, it's way more complicated.

So unless you get very lucky, we have a handful of specimens that still have

eggs inside them, instant giveaway. But this is like two or three. Um,

what you can look for is both reptiles and birds have a thing

called medullary bone, and when you're laying

eggs and you need a lot of calcium very quickly because the egg

shell goes on basically, like, the last minute during egg development.

So you need a lot of calcium very quickly. So during the laying season, these

animals grow this really weird kind of bone texture on

big things like the femur and the humerus, like really big bones in the

body. And that's... It's got a weird texture because it's full of blood

vessels, and it's full of blood vessels so that you can basically apply a lot of blood

supply to it quickly, suck up some of the calcium from that bone,

take it through the system, put it on the eggs, lay your eggs. We

can find that. So if you have a dinosaur

bone and it's the right kind of thing, so you can't do it on like a finger

or a claw or a bit of rib, but nice big bone, you could cut a chunk of that out,

grind it down to the point that it's virtually transparent, a fraction of a millimeter thick,

put it under a microscope and have a look. And if you see the right bone texture,

that's... there are some exceptions, but that's very probably medullary

bone, and you have yourself a female.

So the instant assumption is, okay, so you can tell female from male. No, we can tell

laying female from everything else. So males

won't have medullary bone. Young females won't have them. Females

outside of the breeding season won't have it. Females inside the breeding season, but

maybe they've been really sick this year, don't have it. Or they laid their eggs early

and now they don't need it anymore, won't have it. So

occasionally, if you cut up a bone, which of course we try not to do that much,

you can get the signal of medullary bone and infer that you have a female in the

breeding season.

- But so there's no like large bone structure differences?

- Well, maybe there is, but we haven't seen it. You look at things like kudu or

blackbuck and all kinds of antelope or even most deer,

and the males have horns or antlers and the females don't.

And then you look at something like Triceratops and all the ceratopsians.

There's a big clade of... oh, must be 40 species by

now. And every single one of them has the frill and has

some kind of horn somewhere. You don't

have the hornless ones or the frill-less ones in the way that we do with

a lot of these.

- I'm trying to figure out, is there, how many of the species is it

obvious that there's like, like pelvis differences, all that kind of stuff?

- So pelvis differences works on like humans and apes and

maybe a couple of other mammals, but it's mostly not very good because we are...

It's because we give birth to such a gigantic baby with a gigantic head

compared to our sizes that women have different pelvises to men.

- And then there's size differences, like the skull is not as reliable as the pelvis.

- It's, it's not. And then again, you just need to look at, you know, humans are always

slightly dodgy with this because of, you know, our evolutionary and cultural history.

But like, you know, there's population differences. You know,

you, you... There are, there are maned female lions in places. There

are maneless male lions in places. Um,

reindeer, female reindeer have antlers in winter.

So Rudolph was a girl, because every illustration of Santa and his reindeer

ever, they all have antlers, and that's that's a female reindeer, not a male if it's winter.

- So basically, we don't know much about the dating and the sex lives of T-rexes.

- Well, not much, but you can make some inferences. So for example, all tyrannosaurs

have at least some kind of crest on the head. The early ones have like this

midline crest. It really doesn't work on a human. They have like a midline crest

running along the top of the nose that sticks up. The later ones

largely don't, but they do have this weird armored structure

along those fused nasals and then they have little horns over the

eyes. Those as far as we can tell, don't really have any

kind of obvious mechanical function and loads, like outside of the feathered

dinosaurs, the vast majority of carnivorous dinosaurs

have some kind of crestal display feature on the head.

- When you say display feature, meaning for sex appeal to attract mates?

- Or something like that. So I've always favored the term

socio-sexual selection to cover both sexual

display and sexual dominance and communication, but also

social ones, because those two things are hard to tell apart. Female

lions find males with darker manes sexier, but

male lions find males with darker manes more

intimidating. So one of them is sex, but one of them is social.

- Nice.

- And then-

- I mean, I guess it goes hand-in-hand, sure. Yeah.

- It can, but then you get things like the other one I go for is black

swans, these beautiful Australian birds. They have these really weird curly

feathers on their wings. And males and females both have them, and

males prefer females with curlier feathers, and females prefer males

with curlier feathers. There's an obvious sexual link, but then females fight

too. Females fight over the best nesting spots, and

the females with the curliest feathers tend to win those fights.

- How does that make sense?

- This gets into classic sexual selection theory. It's what's called an honest

signal. You couldn't have those curly feathers if you weren't able to support them.

Because they're the primary feathers on the wings, and what it actually does is it

makes it harder to fly. So you're basically going, "Look how tough I am. I've grown

this big and I can fly and carry on with my giant curly feathers

because I'm really tough and I'm in good shape." And it's the same with the lion.

The reason you get pale lions in the south is because it's close to the

equator, because it's too hot.

So there's the trade-off, because if you have a really black mane, all the

males know you're rock and all the females know you're super sexy, but

you just die of overheating. The trade-off is if the heat's

going to kill you, you're probably better off being a bit paler

and surviving in order to reproduce than you are being

jet black but just dying instantly as soon as it gets hot.

- So there's trade-offs there, okay.

- Yeah, and that's probably what's happening with the

theropods. All the little crests and

horns, Ceratosaurus, Dilophosaurus, tyrannosaurs, allosaurs

have big crests over the eyes, and all kinds of others. I've

written about this, I think this is the trade-off. You're going for the

sexiest look,

and the sexiest look is the biggest horns or the biggest spikes and whatever's on the

head, probably also then with the brightest colors and the most display

patterns, but also this gives you away to

your prey. If you're trying to hide or you're trying to sneak up on something,

being brightly colored or having stripes or all this extra stuff on your head,

you get spotted. But then that's the trade-off.

is if I'm this big and my horns are, if my horns are this

big and this red and yellow and I can still, whoop,

I can still run those guys down and hunt them and kill them and eat them.

Then look how great I must be. Whereas that little guy, he's

only got weedy little crests and they're really dark

because he's so bad at catching stuff he doesn't have the extra

energy to grow big crests. And that's why. But when you're a

herbivore, you don't have that pressure, particularly something like, this

is Protoceratops, but somebody like Triceratops and these guys, they're living in big groups.

You can't hide from a predator when you're a group of 20 animals that are 10 tons

each, so who cares? You just grow the biggest

signal you can possibly grow, and lo and behold, they have giant frills and

giant horns.

- What can you say about beauty in evolution?

Something that's, maybe you can educate me, but something that's not quite an

honest signal that's just pure beauty like peacock feathers?

- So there are things which we think operate closer to that. So there

are, these are the two classic ideas of sexual selection, and both are

probably true to certain degrees in various different species. One is the honest

signal or the, it's the kind of handicap hypothesis because you're holding

yourself back whilst proving you can still do it. I ran the

marathon, you know, carrying a couple of weights. You're

obviously stronger than the guy who ran the marathon without. And so

that's why it's an honest signal and it's why it's a handicap. But the other one is what's called the

But the other one is what's called the sexy sons hypothesis.

The idea is a female might just find a male attractive for no other reason than random.

There is some component of her brain, or whatever it may be, that just

looks cool, and you can actually sort of get this as a

human. Forget human beauty, you can look at a bottle and

go, "That bottle's kind of nice, and that bottle's kind of ugly."

- Where do you put birds? Birds are interesting with this.

Where do you put peacock feathers?

- So they're probably more of a handicap hypothesis because the

colors that go into them and the sheer size and shape—

- Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- ...and these things basically can't fly. They're really vulnerable to predators.

- Can the handicap hypothesis explain just how beautiful peacock feathers get?

- So-

- They go extreme with it.

- So, probably not entirely. There's almost certainly randomness going on in

there as well. And then the eye spots. We know that eye spots are attractive

- So-

- They go extreme with it.

- So, probably not entirely. There's almost certainly randomness going on in

there as well. And then the eye spots. We know that eye spots are attractive

are probably encoded in some way. But yeah, going back to the sexy sons, the idea

is females prefer something different for whatever reason, and there

might actually be some reasons females prefer things that are different.

Different usually means separate and outside,

and that usually comes with variation inherently.

- Oh, so variation is an evolutionary turn-on?

- Yeah, basically.

- Wouldn't it? Man, you're rolling the dice, though, aren't you?

- Yeah, well, you...

- Right.

- You've got to remember, again, it's really easy to look at that sort of thing with a

human perspective where, at maximum, reproductive

output, I think the record — there's some obscure record — it's something

like 66 children, which is probably apocryphal for a

Russian woman who had loads of triplets and quads. But,

humans don't have many offspring, but most animals

lay dozens of eggs or hundreds of eggs or thousands of eggs at a time.

- So, diversity pays off more there.

- So diversity can pay off. We think that's probably a major part of the reason that sex

evolved in the first place: it gives you

resistance to a changing environment and it gives you resistance to parasites and

diseases which often reproduce way faster than you do.

bacteria can divide in a few hours. We reproduce every 20 years.

That's quite a difference. If we were all asexual clones and

you're vulnerable to some disease, you're probably going to get wiped out.

Look at the Irish Potato Famine, or something like that.

So different may be appealing simply because it is different.

variation. And there's at least some evidence for

that. There's swordtails. So anyone who keeps

little fish — if anyone's a tropical fish keeper,

swordtails are really quite common little tropical fish that you can get in

all kinds of aquarium shops, and they're a very boring fish shape.

their tail has a big spike on it, and that's the name. They're really

close relatives of a group called the mollies, which basically don't have

that. In the wild, these are Amazonian fish; they don't usually

encounter each other, but even if you go and get not even the domesticated form,

because these things have been bred for, you know, decades at this point, you can go and get some wild

mollies and give them a wild male swordtail, and they

think he's so much better than all the male mollies. They

will go for that one, and they will preferentially mate with that one. We don't know the exact

mechanism, but it appears to be, he looks similar enough that I

recognize it as a potential mate but different enough that this is exciting.

And then this is where the sexy sons kick in because the females are now assuming

those animals are successful, and they can hybridize, or maybe it's

just a male who just happens to be a little bit blue or a little bit red or whatever it may

be. Well, the female offspring,

the daughters are probably going to inherit mother's preference, I really like

red, and the males

are probably going to have red in them because their dad had more red. So guess

what the next generation does? There's more red, and the females

like more red, and you don't have to come back much further, and suddenly all

the males are bright red. And that's

closer to beauty than I think almost anything else would be, with still a

naturalistic explanation.

- We kind of started talking about beauty from how much social life

- Yeah, a T-rex might have.

- a T-rex might have, so just to kind of

take that to a place of what we know and what we don't know. So can we

kind of know something about their social life, where they lived, how they lived?

- So the very fact that they have these apparently socio-sexually

selected signals, the little crest and stuff in the

head. So there's a branch of sexual

selection called mutual sexual selection, and the black swans are an

example of this. The classic sexual selection is your peacocks and your lions

and things like this. Males are bigger and more

flamboyant and whatever it is, and they're doing all the competing. But

mutual sexual selection, and this is really common in a whole bunch

of things that people are familiar with but don't know. Loads of seabirds,

starlings, the common starling that we have in Europe and has been introduced into the U.S.,

parrots, various other things, where basically males

and females invest similarly in rearing the

offspring. So the idea generally, both with handicap and

sexy son, but particularly with handicap, is the idea that males are proving their

worth. They're basically saying, "I'm the biggest, strongest, healthiest, I've got the best

genes, I should be the father of your offspring." They go around

showing off and then mate with as many females as possible.

While the females then do all the work and make the nest and look after

the chicks and, yeah, or rear them or give birth or whatever it may be, yada, yada,

yada. So the idea with mutual sexual selection is, what if there's not

much food around?

Things like puffins or, you know, penguins in the Arctic where the male sits with the

egg and the female toddles off, gets food, and then comes back two months later or whatever it

is. On their own, they can't rear the offspring. They have to have

a male investment. Well, suddenly the male's now putting loads of effort in,

so the male's now in the same position that a female would be in under the normal

conditions. You don't want to be the sexiest, toughest, biggest male,

and you can only mate once, all right? There are various cheats, but we

won't get into that just yet. You're only going to mate once and you're going to put all your effort into helping

rearing offspring, rather than chasing down as many girls as possible. Are

you going to go for the biggest, fittest female as well, or are you going to go for the small, weedy

one that doesn't look very well? You go for the best one. Well,

how do you know that? Well, because she's got a crest as well, and so

suddenly you now get mutual ornamentation just like the

black swans where the males are checking out the curliest females, and the

females are checking out the curliest males, and you'll see they mutually pair

up. This is what we see with things like starlings. Males like the brightest females,

females like the brightest males, they tend to form pairs. The darkest

and least bright ones are obviously kind of left with each other at the bottom of the pile.

They tend to pair up. But it means that when you've got signals in both males

and females, like every triceratops or every

tyrannosaurus, it at least hints that they're going down this route,

and that they might cooperate for reproduction.

- Wow. Another like weak signal that tells a powerful story.

- Yeah, and the problem is it's compromised by lots of things. So that goes back to your earlier

question about telling males from females apart. The vast majority of dinosaur

species, like 90 plus percent, are known from a single specimen.

And a specimen is not necessarily very complete at all. It might be a

couple of bones, it might be one bone, it might be a tooth in a couple of

cases. The actual number where we've got a decent number of real

whole skeletons that we can actually compare to each other,

less than 10. Probably more like five or six.

- Can I ask you a weird question? If you were to, let's say,

all humans died right now—

...press a button, poof, gone, how much of human civilization would

you be able to reconstruct from just the skeletons that are in the

ground? Like, you just start collecting skeletons. There's a lot of them.

There are billions of them. Would you be able to start telling a

story, like urban centers?

- Yeah, probably, because—

- You could probably reconstruct a lot, right?

- And if nothing else, just the, you know, superlative brain cavity

will tell you quite a lot, you know.

- Yeah, the intelligence.

- Must have been very, very smart with...

- You could-

- ...a brain that big.

- You can probably reconstruct some of the behavior, a lot of the behavior, social behavior.

A lot of this stuff.

- And you're going to see stuff like, you know, it's the famous one of... I think it was

a Neanderthal. There was a famous question of like, you know, "At what point do you

think society exists?" And maybe one of the Leakeys but the

answer was basically this skeleton because it was someone with a

real-like a properly busted leg and then it fully

healed. And it's like if that person was on their own, just

dead, someone had to look after them for months

to get that level of healing. You only do that to someone you're really

devoted to and probably a group of people 'cause even one person can't look

after one other person, right? So that's your

society. And yet you think about the pathology of skeletons

in the human race. How, you know, how many of us have broken a bone?

Most adults have probably broken a couple of bones

even if it's just a finger or a nose or

something. But then you think about what medicine has done and you would be able to

see treatments of complete compound fractures of guys

who survived horrific car crashes and treatments of cancer, bone

cancers and stuff like that. You would see that. Well, how is that happening? Either

they're magic or they've got some kind of... In which case, they'd probably cure

it instantly or there's some kind of technology in society supporting that change.

- That just hints at the fact that the evidence collection and

the reasoning mechanisms that paleontology and archaeology uses is really powerful.

- Yeah, it is.

- And so it could be very effective even just with a small amount of data.

I mean you could-

- But it's the right amount of data. That's the thing. We can find dozens of skeletons

that we can't do very much with and then the right one that, you know,

things like stomach contents, you know, that's a super or bite marks is a super powerful bit of

data but it doesn't turn up that often. So it's not like you can get it off every

skeleton. And that's the thing, it's the pool of data and I think

that's what people miss. We, as paleontologists, we get caught up

on single superlative specimens and then try and

treat them as a... like a silver bullet almost.

So Microraptor, I mentioned this before, little flying dinosaur, crow-sized or

gliding dinosaur. Crow-sized thing from China. We've got at least a

# Chapter 14

- But it's the right amount of data. That's the thing. We can find dozens of skeletons

on single superlative specimens and then try and

treat them as a... like a silver bullet almost.

So Microraptor, I mentioned this before, little flying dinosaur, crow-sized or

gliding dinosaur. Crow-sized thing from China. We've got at least a

dozen good specimens of it by now and multiple ones with stomach

contents. There's one I've described with a little mammal foot inside

it, there's one with a bird inside it, there's one with a lizard inside it and there's

one with a fish inside it. On their own, and this happened for at

least two of the papers describing these things, it's like, "It ate fish.

These are fish-eating animals." No, that one ate one

fish once. That one ate one bird

once, that one ate one mammal once and that one ate one lizard

once. So what have we actually got here?

I suspect we've got a group of generalists and we just happen to have found them eating different things

at different times. But equally, it's also possible, at

least, that, yeah, this is one of these things and it had learned to

eat fish when the others hadn't and actually this was mostly fish eaters and the others

ate whatever they could get. Maybe one caught a bird up a tree in a

nest. Maybe one found it dead on the ground. You don't really know what

one of these things on its own is fascinating, but potentially misleading.

- Well, the way you're describing it now, it seems like, yes, it's potentially misleading, but

there's... in your whole way of being and the way you've been talking about

this stuff I can see that

it's not just the direct evidence you're mentioning. It's like, it's a bunch of

intuitions you build up. It's like you're stitching together a bunch

of little things... It's the Sherlock Holmes thing. Not just this one piece of evidence.

this one piece of evidence-

... it's like, "Okay, what do I know about the general other

dinosaurs that are on the Earth? The different animals-"

... how animals usually behave about this period, about the environment?" And all of that comes

together, and then- ... figuring out which is true.

- And that's... So one thing I've definitely written about is,

yeah, the independent lines of evidence. Can you get

stuff that is as far as possible truly

independent from the other data and does it give you the

same answer? And then when it does-

- That's powerful.

- ... that's incredibly powerful. So Spinosaurus or the-

the spinosaurs as a whole is my go-to example for this are

the... guys with the famous big sail back and the weird crocodile-like

head, though some of them look rather different to that. And if you look across

all the species and specimens that we have, incredibly fragmentary and very badly

known, but they're all basically associated with... When you look at the gestalt,

you see a whole bunch of stuff for these things. So they

do have a surprisingly crocodile-like head and crocodile-like teeth compared to every

other carnivorous dinosaur. And when you do the mechanical analysis, you

see they function in a very similar way. And indeed,

teeth, here's a spinosaur tooth with very nearly circular

cross section, really distinctive, similar to crocodiles, similar

to dolphins, similar to fish-eating fish.

So points to fish. Crocodile-like head, points to

fish. Crocs eat other stuff too, but still. Um,

they're usually found in or near aquatic systems now.

Fossils in general tend to turn up in aquatic systems because you've got to be buried to become a fossil.

So water association is common, but even so, that's true.

They turn up in places where lots of other dinosaurs don't tend to turn up,

including carnivores, which suggests they're eating something

else. If you look at the isotopic signature of the

teeth, often it correlates with crocodiles, fish,

turtles, and stuff that lives in water, and doesn't correlate well

with other land-living dinosaurs that lived in the same time and same place.

So you put all of that together, and it's really hard to

argue... Oh, in addition to the tiny detail of Baryonyx, the British

one was found with fish scales inside its chest cavity. So you put all of

that together, and yeah, I'm not saying it only ate fish.

I'm sure it ate big shrimp and turtles. And we know they were

predating on terrestrial dinosaurs and pterosaurs because, again, stomach

contents and teeth and stuff. But fundamentally, this is an

animal or a group of animals doing something different to the other carnivorous

dinosaurs, and it's probably linked to water, and it's probably linked to

fish as a predominant way of living.

- We should mention that you're working on a book out in early 2026?

- In the UK it will be out in November. In North America, January or February 2026.

- It's called Spinosaur Tales: The Biology and Ecology of the Spinosaurus. And...

- Written with Mark Witton, who did that picture.

- It's a beautiful creature.

- Which I think is in there. Mark's done a ton of new artwork. He helped write

the book, but he's also the artist.

- I mean, can you describe a little bit more about this creature? There's a bunch of stuff like

what you just mentioned. There's some debate. Like where-

Is it... To what degree is it aquatic? So what-

- Not very is my take.

- So does it live in the water? Does it-

- I... Yeah. So I think it's basically a big wader.

It's a poor analogy, but it's a very weird, giant stork.

- Oh. Got it.

- Or heron.

- Was giant.

- Yeah. So potentially bigger than T-Rex. Linearly, not in

mass. Again, really quite narrow chest versus that T-Rex

barrel. But potentially 15 meters long, so bigger than any

T-Rex we've found, at least in terms of length.

- Can you describe what it looks like? The... I mean, there's some iconic features to it, right?

- Yeah. So this really quite long head,

with a kind of wavy jawline. Like, animals have

You know, most carnivores have straight jaws. This one has a kind of

somewhat wiggly jawline. It really narrows at the front and then opens up

again into a like a little... It's called a rosette. So you've got like a little

semicircle, and then a dip, and then the jaws go back, and then the teeth

line waves up and down. These really conical teeth, which doesn't

sound very exciting, but it makes them

different to every other carnivorous dinosaur. No other thing has a conical

tooth, which is a classic fish thing, or at least biting hold of

something that wriggles. The nostrils are not at

the tip of the nose. They're pushed back, at least somewhat. It has a bunch of crests on the

head. It's got quite a long neck. Spinosaurus and at

least a couple of the other closest relatives to it, a thing called Ichthyovenator.

from... I can't remember if it's Thailand or Laos. I think it's Laos. It has this

giant elongated bit to the top of the vertebrae, so it gives it

this giant sail along the back. Spinosaurus,

at least, possibly Ichthyovenator, probably not any of the others, then

has this weird, thin, newt-like

expanse to the top of the tail, giving it kind of like a giant oar paddle

appearance. Mostly they have very large arms with

giant claws on the hands. And Spinosaurus

at least appears to have really quite short legs, but the others

don't. But again, so

Spinosaurus is totally iconic, but if you look at something like Baryonyx from the

UK or Suchomimus from Niger,

it's still got the same head, neck, and arms, but it doesn't have this

sail, and it doesn't have this tail, and it probably doesn't have short legs. So Spinosaurus

is super weird and exaggerated version of what

was already a kind of super weird group of theropods.

So Spinosaurus is properly strange. And then, as you kind of

hinted at, super controversial as well, because various papers have

claimed it's a diver or a really good swimmer, and I think the evidence for that is

very weak at best.

- So your book is going to be... You're going to start some shit with your book. It's going to be all contro-

- I think... I think I already have, to be honest. I've written...

I've written three major papers, and one in particular with my colleague,

Tom Holt, where we frankly savaged the idea that it's a good swimmer. And then-

- Oh.

- ...other people have since, including some of the authors who were on the original paper

claiming it did swim well, have now effectively reversed their position and said it

didn't.

- So the Jurassic Park 3 fight between the two-

- Yeah.

- ...who's famous. In a real-life encounter, who wins?

- Probably still T-Rex. I mean, the Jurassic Park Spinosaurus was pretty good for its

time because some of the stuff that I've just talked about,

particularly the short legs were suggested way back in 1910,

1912, but it was really uncertain.

Now it appears to be more likely the case than not. The tail was unknown at

this point, so it was just given a very generic tail. But

the crocodile-like head is pretty good. The neck's a bit short.

The sail is a bit too... It's almost just like a semicircle stuck on the

back, and it's a bit more complicated than that. But personally, I'm quite a

big fan of the Jurassic Park 3 Spinosaurus. I think for its era, it's

really quite good. It is massive. There is this... They're from, I'm going to say,

Morocco, because Spinosaurus is found throughout North Africa, Morocco,

Algeria, Egypt. There's a massive pair of jaws or

snout that's in a collection in Milan

that's absolutely outsized. It's like an absolute giant. And that points

to a truly monumentally sized Spinosaurus, which is where all these upper

estimates of 15-plus meters come from, is just this one set of jaws. But

yeah, it's about right, but it's just a bit too muscly and a bit

too bulky. But in gross appearance, it's pretty good.

- Does it have a chance against a T-Rex?

- No. Because it's got this unbelievably long, thin

jaw, which whilst much stronger than something like

Baryonyx, is fundamentally not that strong. The jaws are very long and thin, and then the teeth are...

The jaws are very long and thin, and then the teeth are... Yeah. They're

big, but they're not... big, big.

You know, the whole, like, it grabs the T-Rex neck and

then, like, snaps it. Well, Spinosaurus

actually, its neck is really strong going up and down and is

very weak rotating or going side to side. So it's got the

weakest kind of possible neck to, like, rotate and snap the T-Rex, and

# Chapter 15

- No. Because it's got this unbelievably long, thin

jaw, which whilst much stronger than something like

Baryonyx, is fundamentally not that strong. The jaws are very long and thin, and then the teeth are...

The jaws are very long and thin, and then the teeth are... Yeah. They're

big, but they're not... big, big.

You know, the whole, like, it grabs the T-Rex neck and

then, like, snaps it. Well, Spinosaurus

actually, its neck is really strong going up and down and is

very weak rotating or going side to side. So it's got the

weakest kind of possible neck to, like, rotate and snap the T-Rex, and

then T-Rex has got, like, the strongest neck of anything. So you've got, like,

the weakest jaw with the weakest spin versus the strongest neck.

So no, I don't buy it.

- So that brings it back to the topic we touched on a little bit. What are... You've

mentioned a bunch of the stuff that the Jurassic Park...

...series gets wrong? Maybe you could speak to more

things, but also, what does it get right?

- So a lot of, like, very, in some level generic, but quite important things it gets

right. T-Rex is about the right size and shape and is

massive, and you don't actually see it run. You see it power walk. If you watch the Jeep chase again,

you'll see it only ever has one foot on the ground.

The weird thing for me is how much some of them vary. So, like, I'm a big

pterosaur guy. I do lots of work on pterosaurs, the flying reptiles. The

Pteranodons in Jurassic Park Two: The Lost

World, you see them very, very briefly in one of the last shots and they're okay, but

they're not great, but it's clearly a bit of a throwaway shot. The ones in Jurassic

Park Three, I think are mostly excellent. Really, really

good. And then the ones in Jurassic World are terrible. Like, a

massive regression. There's loads and loads of details that are right in

JP3 that are completely wrong in Jurassic World, and you're like, "Why did you take a

really good model and make it much, much worse and less

accurate?" I don't understand. And I...

Again, it's fiction. At one level, who cares? But, like, as you said, like,

I don't think... So, see, the weird thing for me is,

I don't think it would affect how they're perceived

by the public. Some things I get. Like, for example, in

Jurassic World, the Pteranodons pick people up with their feet and fly off with

them. Pteranodon's feet don't work like that. It would never be able to do that, and it would

never have the lift. But I get for dramatic purposes, you might want to show that.

Okay, fine. You know, this is your big sequence. You need that. But for

the rest of the animal, it's weirdly inaccurate,

and I don't think the public would know and

they might well care if it was much more accurate.

And I don't think it would be any harder to make it accurate than to make it

inaccurate. I've spoken to a colleague of mine who I won't

name, just in case I get him into trouble.

who's a big dinosaur nerd, but also a big creature creator

and designer, and has done a whole bunch of proper Hollywood

A-list movie stuff. And I asked him about this, and I

went, "Okay, but, like, is it just easier to

take the model that you've got and mess around with it than to, if I came in

and said, 'You need to fix that, and you need to fix this, you need to fix this, you need to fix that?'"

And he basically went, "No, it's about the same amount of effort." It's not like

we don't have the director or the producer or the lead designer going, "No, I want that arm

a bit longer. I want that tail a bit brighter. Can you add a few more bits there? I don't like

those scales." So he said, "We're doing that constantly anyway. So doing

it to one set of design specs versus another set of design specs is no

more hassle." In other words, he said, "It's no harder to make it accurate than to make

it inaccurate." And it's like, if that's truly the case,

then just make it right. And then you can claim a level of accuracy

and engagement that you can. I mean, it's interesting.

There's a thing called the Jurassic Foundation. After the first Jurassic Park

made an absolute fortune. I think it was Spielberg directly, may have been through

Universal, but anyway, they set up the Jurassic Foundation, and it's a small fund of

money for research on dinosaurs and related animals, and academics can apply for

it. One of my PhD students got some money from the Jurassic

Foundation. That's great. He didn't have to do that. He went,

"Paleontology's helped give me this. I'm going to give back a bit." And after

what must be, what, 30 years now, it's probably funded an awful lot of research and

helped young researchers get a start. So

there's a level of engagement there that I think hasn't been

in subsequent films, which you can kind of see

once it goes from being a one-off to being a

franchise, and it's changed hands. I mean, how many different directors has it had

now? You know, Spielberg did the first two, and

then don't know about the next five. Must be two, if not another three more

people, you know, and 30 years later, it's all changing.

- Yeah, but that's the path of creating a legendary film.

The depth of accuracy, and it's not that difficult to work, but it's also...

It does something to the whole artistic creation

if you create a culture where the details really, really matter.

- Matter. Yeah, and again, there are some oddities, so like

Gallimimus, I mentioned it earlier, so one of the ornithomimosaurs. The model for

gallimimus in Jurassic World is nearly

identical to that from Jurassic Park. One of the differences, which you

can barely see on film, but I know this is true because I

found it in like, a Jurassic World kids book cause I flicked through it when it came out, is a

closeup of the head with an arrow to the teeth. Gallimimus doesn't have

teeth. It's got a beak. So someone has taken the original model

and actively spent time adding teeth to an animal that didn't

have them. I would understand it. I'm not saying I agree with it, but I'd

understand if it was a rule of cool and like, "Yeah, but it would look so

much better with all these gnarly big teeth and whatever." And it's like, you can't

even see it in the final thing. They've got tiny little heads. In the film, all they

do is like, run past the camera briefly. It's not like they're a big

carnivore and they're engaged in like, one of the big battles. Like, why? Why?

It's not like... You can barely even see them.

- Well, yeah, again, just to linger on it. There is a lot of value to

authenticity in all walks of life, and one of them is

...accuracy. When you're talking about dinosaurs, it's so

valuable and so worthy, and it's respectable for the long life of a film to be

accurate. I just wish, I hope they do that. There are certain directors that really

dogmatically push that. Alex Garland comes to mind. You know,

he did, whenever he integrates quantum computing or AI into a film...

- Mm-hmm. Nolan with the black hole in Interstellar.

...ended up publishing a paper on the calculation to visualize that.

- I mean, that's legendary.

- Yeah.

- That's great. That's really...

And like, you think that has nothing to do with the story, the narrative of the film, but it

does. It, like, permeates everything. If you get that black hole right, that...

...everybody else steps up their game, and really,

really tells a story in this way that reverberates through time, and it, like,

really moves people. So,

- Yeah. I, I, yeah, I mean, as I say, I, I wish it was

better. I mean, the only thing I'd flip it around is a joke I've made

more than once, but like, just don't take it as a documentary. No

one watches James Bond and goes, "That's how international espionage works."

You know, he's got the laser watch and the exploding car, and he's like,

maybe treat it a bit as fiction. I've heard from a friend of mine

who worked at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, which I've mentioned before, in

Alberta, which is an absolutely phenomenal place, and

she said after the first one, genuinely, like, it was not

common, but more than once, people were annoyed

that they didn't have the real dinosaurs out back, because they'd seen them, and

they knew that the real ones were out there. Which is a testament to

Industrial Light & Magic and Stan Winston, but also...

- Wow.

- ...slightly horrifying that anyone watched Jurassic Park

and literally thought that. Also, why would you go to a museum? You go to the zoo if

it's alive.

- There you will also meet what is it, King Kong and Godzi-

I don't think we quite touched on this. I really want to ask you

about intelligence. What we know about

...the intelligence of, let's say, T-Rex. We talked about his big head. What do we know

about-

- Not much. So there's a T-Rex brain, or at least a very rough cast of part of one.

- That's the actual look of-

- Yeah, this is

...so dinosaurs, in fact, most reptiles. I don't know if you can see it on the

velociraptor. Not really, unfortunately. Um-

- It's elongated.

- Yeah, but it's more that they have... we are weird in

that we have a brain that basically fills the inside of our

skull. What most animals have is actually a little kind

of sub-skull inside the main skull, which is called the

endocast or endocranium, and the brain is in that. And even then, it's

not, like, full of brain because we've packed an awful lot of brain into a limited

space, and they then have quite a lot of goo and fat and other stuff around

it. But it means for dinosaurs, and then deep reptiles and birds in

general, in the old days you could basically cut one

open, but now we'll CT scan through them, you can take an internal mold of the

endocranium or the brain case, and then whatever

filled that would've been the brain and its surrounding tissues. And that's how

you get something like this. In this case, someone literally cracked open an old

skull-

...and basically took an internal mold in the same way that you do an external mold for the

skulls. And that tells you quite a lot about

certain things. So for example, they've got a bulb at the

front, which is the olfactory bulb. So brains are very stereotyped, again, ours are super

weird, so you have the olfactory bulb at the front and behind that you have the optic bulb or the

optic lobe. So roughly how big they are will tell you roughly how

much of the brain is devoted to, for example, sight and smell. So if

it's a lot, it's pretty good. If there's not much, it's not very

good. That goes quite a long way already.

One thing we've done in the last few years is you can also get into the,

it's not shown here, it wouldn't be part of this, but the inner ear.

We can CT scan into the structure of the bony inner ear, and from

that you can actually get an idea of what frequency of sounds

# Chapter 16

front, which is the olfactory bulb. So brains are very stereotyped, again, ours are super

weird, so you have the olfactory bulb at the front and behind that you have the optic bulb or the

optic lobe. So roughly how big they are will tell you roughly how

much of the brain is devoted to, for example, sight and smell. So if

it's a lot, it's pretty good. If there's not much, it's not very

good. That goes quite a long way already.

One thing we've done in the last few years is you can also get into the,

it's not shown here, it wouldn't be part of this, but the inner ear.

We can CT scan into the structure of the bony inner ear, and from

that you can actually get an idea of what frequency of sounds

the inner ear was structured ...to be pitched to.

- Wow.

- Which doesn't actually tell you very much, but it's phenomenally cool that you

can do it.

- We should say you also have quite a bit of a background in biology. So you're trying to

reconstruct biology from, go from paleontology to biology.

- Yeah, my go-to one-liner is, "I'm a zoologist

but I work on dead stuff." My degree was zoology. My

official job title now is Reader of Zoology. I teach zoology. I don't teach

Paleo. So yeah, living animals

was always actually my primary interest, and I kind of fell into

paleo, but then I wanted to drag that with me because I'd been

trained in behavior and ecology and it's what I was most interested in, so then applying that

knowledge and understanding to these animals.

- So to some degree it is possible to reach towards the biology?

- Absolutely, yeah.

- So with the ear, that's interesting. The brain.

- Yeah.

- So we can know something about the brain?

- Yeah, but then when you get into intelligence is when it gets really awkward

because working out exactly which bits of this are

probably linked to, like, the main fundamental processing and what

you'd link to actual intelligence is tough.

On top of that, we don't really know what's been the big challenge of the last couple of years of this

question, was T-Rex and other dinosaurs super intelligent? Like, neuron

density. How many basically nerve cells can you pack in per

bit of volume? Because birds have some weird tricks which means they get a lot more

brain per volume. Just how much of

the brain case was brain and how much was, like, goop around it,

we know varies, so you're getting kind of fairly big upper and lower

band, and then the other big thing we always have to do is factor in

size. Big animals need bigger brains to operate them. So

whales have really big brains, but whales weigh tens of tons. They're

not smarter than us. So you have the classic thing is a thing called

the encephalization quotient, which is at a very

simple level, it is the volume of brain scaled against the size of the animal.

We have huge brains compared to how big we are, so we're massively up

the chart. And then you do have a few things with, like, worms. I should probably

stick to vertebrates, because there's some stupid stuff which has a

surprisingly small brain for its size. Most things that

aren't primates, and things like crows and parrots, sit

very neatly on a couple of different curves. There's a curve for reptiles, a curve for birds, a

curve for mammals, and things like this. And

basically that's it. But also, actually, our understanding with mass estimates for

dinosaurs is good but not great, and so you could easily be out by,

you could easily be out by like 20 or 30% on the volume of the

brain inside the brain case, and then you could be out by 20 or 30% on your

mass estimate. Well, now suddenly, it's very

easy to make the brain too big and the animal too light and it's

super smart, or make the brain too small and the animal too heavy and it's super

dumb. So that's awkward, unfortunately.

- So apparently there's a, some controversial paper that suggests that T-Rex is a pri-

has primate-level intelligence.

- Yeah, and then that was shot down within a few months by a

team of paleontologists and a couple of other neurologists who really

went to town on it.

- Just counting the number of... Trying to estimate the number of neurons.

- Yeah, it was the neuron density thing, and yeah

I've unsurprisingly support the revised

one which was done by a whole bunch... Yeah, the Casper paper. I've spoken

to Casper about it, couple of the other authors.

- So, they scaled down the number of neurons from three billion

down to 250 million to 1.7 billion.

- Yeah, much, much lower.

- Which is similar to crocodiles and other primates.

- Yeah, which is kind of what you'd expect. I mean, a couple of other people at

various times have suggested they're really smart. And again, you know, birds

have this thing of, they have this weird thing of neuron folding, and they

can basically pack in a lot more than you'd expect. You know, that's why crows are that

smart despite having

tiny brains, relatively even compared to their overall size. But

I'm being obviously overly facetious, but if

ultimately part of your scaling is how big is the animal

versus how big is its brain, that's most of a T-Rex

brain. It's a fraction of the size of a chimp brain, and

chimps don't weigh seven tons. So,

you know, it's a kind of Hitchens-like extraordinary claims

require extraordinary evidence, but you just look at it and go

that's about the proportion we'd expect for a croc. Now, crocs are smarter than

people think, but they're sure as hell not monkeys. Um,

you're going to have to really come up with something much more

convincing than, "Oh well, if you just pack 'em in, if you scale 'em this way."

- A bit of a ridiculous question, but is it possible to find evidence of tool use?

- I mean, in theory, it depends quite how you define a

tool, so birds building nests is arguably tool use to a certain degree.

I'm aware of... I suspect it's turned out not to be the case. I was, I was

shown a very rough, not very well-prepared fossil

20 years ago now, no, 15 years ago now, where someone said, "We

think this might be an early bird nest and therefore potentially

even a dinosaur nest," and nothing's ever been published, so my guess is

once they excavated it and had a good look at it, they went, "Nah, it's nothing

really." I mean, I guess the question is, how would you know?

- Yeah, it would be difficult unless it's obvious, widespread, primate-like...

- Yeah, but even then, like, you know...

- ...sapient-like almost.

- Chimps make loads of tools, but it's mostly made of wood, and they're mostly just

breaking stuff, and then the odds of that preserving are very

low. You do get things like chimps and otters, sea otters,

you know, they have their favorite anvil and hammer stones to break stuff open.

But again, the reason they picked that stone is 'cause it's really heavy and good at

breaking oysters or breaking nuts. It's not gonna leave, or

probably not gonna leave stereotypical points on the rock. And even then,

you could just go, "Well, maybe it, you know,

just got bashed up in a river or something."

- So, in your book "Uncovering Dinosaur Behavior," you conclude that there's a lot

we might not know. What's a particular lost behavior

that we don't know about that you think might be out there?

- Something like midden use, so a whole bunch of animals and

birds who basically crap in the same spot. They

have their spot, and that's where they go. So, rabbits do this,

sloths do this, aardvarks, even things like wildebeest and zebra, not zebra, impala

will tend to go back to the same place every day.

But the fossil record of sarcoplites, fossilized feces and

fossilized waste from dinosaurs, it exists, but it's extremely

rough because of course, this is the stuff that's already been digested and broken

down. It's already kind of gooey and broken up and doesn't have a lot going for it.

If they do it in water, it's going to dissipate instantly. If it rains, it's

probably going to fall apart. Things like dung beetles and flies will break it

down. Even if it gets covered by sand or whatever from a sandstorm, it's probably

still going to compress and separate. So, are you ever going to find it?

Maybe going back to our trackway stuff, but even if you do, what species

left that? We know a big herbivore did this, but was it

Triceratops, or was it an Ankylosaur? Those animals are very different things

doing very different things, and it would tell you different things about their behavior

- Yeah, so one piece of behavior I forgot to ask you about.

So, T-Rex engaging cannibalism.

- Yeah, almost certainly. Well, certainly. I think we've got

there's a T-Rex bone with a T-Rex embedded tooth in it. With overgrowth.

I think it's, I want to say it's an Albertosaur rather than T-Rex, but there is

there is a tyrannosaur jaw in Alberta with a

T-Rex tooth stuck in it, and you can pull the little tooth out.

And then there's a T-Rex foot bone with these

distinctive feeding traces on them. And this actually goes back to that early

point about T-Rex being weird, being the only big carnivore in its environment,

because if this was even Mongolia at that time, but anywhere else, there's

three or four or five big carnivores. And so you find a bone and it's chewed

up by a big carnivore, we don't know who did it. But when you see a

big bone chewed up in a T-Rex ecosystem,

well, you know, if it's anything bigger than this, you know it was

T-Rex. And so when it's a T-Rex bone with T-Rex bite marks,

- Yep, it's pretty obvious.

- QED. Yeah, so it must have been.

- That's fascinating, isn't it? That they would attack themselves, their own species.

- Cannibalism turns up in a whole bunch of stuff. Um,

but it's very rare as like a fairly habitual behavior.

- So, but there's several reasons you might be engaging in,

or rather teeth marks might tell various stories.

So it could be just fighting for dominance, right?

- It, it could, but it's unlikely, and in this case, so again, we see there are

loads of facial injuries in tyrannosaurs, in carnivorous dinosaurs generally, but

particularly tyrannosaurs. They have really beaten up heads, like half

or even two-thirds of adults have scarring and facial

injuries. But you see healing on it, whereas this foot does not show

healing and it's got multiple different bites. The idea that

you'd bite a foot whilst fighting someone and then go back and bite that one

foot again? That's pretty unlikely.

- So, looks like it's eating, not fighting.

- Yeah, and they're more like the feeding scrape traces than they are the big puncture wounds, so

again, not impossible, but very weird for that to occur as a fight.

# Chapter 17

loads of facial injuries in tyrannosaurs, in carnivorous dinosaurs generally, but

particularly tyrannosaurs. They have really beaten up heads, like half

or even two-thirds of adults have scarring and facial

healing and it's got multiple different bites. The idea that

you'd bite a foot whilst fighting someone and then go back and bite that one

foot again? That's pretty unlikely.

- So, looks like it's eating, not fighting.

- Yeah, and they're more like the feeding scrape traces than they are the big puncture wounds, so

again, not impossible, but very weird for that to occur as a fight.

- So fascinating.

- So yeah, they're- they're fighting, they're fighting probably quite a lot, but

whether or not you actually eat something that you've

killed or that you stumble across as a body, it definitely happens occasionally.

Otherwise, we wouldn't have the record of that, but there's a reason carnivores

often don't eat carnivores, and particularly don't eat their own

species, which is parasitism. Carnivores in

general are loaded with parasites because they spend their whole

lives eating food which has parasites and stuff in it.

And so they tend to accumulate a lot of them. What's the one thing that's

definitely gonna have the most parasites in it that can infect you as, for

example, a lion? It's another lion that eats the exact same stuff

that you do. So whilst it is food and particularly if you've

just won a big fight, you might want to eat.

In general, cannibalism's pretty rare because it's

generally not a good idea if there's other food available. But yeah, if

you're starving to death or, you know, the other guy ripped your leg half off and you

don't think you're gonna walk for six weeks, not that you'd think, but you know what I mean.

Like, and now there's a body in front of you, it's two tons of meat, well,

maybe you should tuck in.

- This is so fascinating, like, once again, figuring out this puzzle.

And like, what does cannibalism tell you? You're piecing together the

story of T-rex, their life, their hunting life, their social life from

their evolution to their biology to their behavior. That's so fascinating.

- Yeah, we try to. But the thing is, it's always getting better which is

So that's what I try to finish on in my book on behavior is,

I felt I'd written a couple of hundred pages of, "We keep

screwing this up, we've overstated this, I think people have misunderstood this, this-"

You know, like the track ways stuff, and like, this is not as confident as we think,

you need to look at these alternate explanations. This behavior shows that that behavior probably

doesn't correlate the way you said it does, yada, yada, yada. And it's like, and now I feel like I've just written a

book trashing my entire field and all my colleagues, or at least many of my

colleagues. And then, but then you flip it on its head and

going, "We've got techniques that were undreamed

of ten years ago. We've got data streams that were undreamed

of ten years ago. And we've actually got a much better understanding of living

species." And then on top of that we're just constantly finding new animals, you

you know, we have not just

new species, which are often, I think, a lot less important, but just new specimens of ones

we know, because again, it's building up that database. You know, we drifted off talking

about sexual selection, but like, yeah, if you want to know growth, one or two

animals doesn't tell you how an animal, a species, grows. 50 or 100

does. And then that reveals a hell of a lot more about things like sexual

dimorphism and growth rate and how vulnerable juveniles are and population structure

and maybe how they're reproducing. So I'd

like to think I knocked down, I think, a few towers that probably a few people were

fond of, but I think we have the raw materials to build much

better, stronger edifice of behavior.

But as you say, it's always going to be based around

often very piecemeal evidence and

like possibilities and probabilities rather than certainties.

- Let's talk about a sad topic: extinction.

- Yep.

- How did the dinosaurs go extinct?

- Mostly, probably, pretty quickly, but it really is

the answer that I think most people are now probably familiar with, which is, it's an

asteroid impact or some kind of extraterrestrial body hit

just off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico about 66 million years

ago that basically atomized the

asteroid, but also importantly, the bit of the ground it hit, or

below the sea bed that it hit, was basically the worst kind of rock.

And so it put up this enormous ash cloud and basically you

have a nearly instantaneous nuclear winter. I mean, immediate

devastation. You know, and anything immediately

next to it is obviously just vaporized. But you know, this is the sort of thing that's

hot enough to set fire to the atmosphere. I think the one I read was,

it's something like a piece of rock about the size of Mount Everest

traveling at something like 10 times the speed of sound. So just

the momentum between that speed and mass thing is just, you know,

beyond extraordinary.

- But I think what does a lot of damage is the change in the climate, and-

- Yeah, and so every... There are five recognized mass

extinctions in the history of life on Earth, and all of them are ultimately some form of climate

change, whether it's volcanic eruptions or

hyper-oxygenation, or an ice age or whatever. It's climate

changing too quickly for things to adapt to. And that starts, you know, that

just cripples entire populations and entire species. And then if you do

enough damage to enough things, you start getting ecosystem

collapse. You know, this moth has died out. Well, it turns out that

moth is the primary pollinator of this tree. Well, that tree produced nuts, and

that was the entire winter survival store for this squirrel. Well, that squirrel

was the main food of this cat, and now

suddenly the moth going has killed four other things and everything that's attached to that.

And so that's really what did for them.

- And sadly, the big things... Well, everything

dies, but the big things have a lot of trouble recovering.

- Yeah. So, I mean, this is, you know, a classic

example. So, oh well, you know, what is paleontology good for? Well, actually, really, it's

extinction, which is very relevant right now in that we have a very good

handle on when you have extreme climate stress, what

tends to suffer more and what tends to suffer less. And as we say,

big things fundamentally do. They require more

resources, they require more area of land. You need to roam

further, which means, you know, if you're a mouse and you

happen to have a little bit of land and that bit doesn't get hit, you're fine; whereas if you're an

elephant and you need all of this land and even a chunk of it goes

wrong, well, that's probably maybe not enough for you to survive anymore.

So, yeah, big things suffer disproportionately badly from these things, and

mostly as well we think terrestrial things generally do worse than

things in water because water's a great equilibrating

medium, you know, it takes ages to heat up, it takes ages to cool

down. Yes, if you live in specific coastal conditions or something, maybe

you can't travel that easily, but, you know, whales can go from

pole to pole quite happily, and plenty of other fish do too. So if it's too hot

or too cold or too nasty here, you can just swim somewhere else,

whereas if you're an animal and you hit a desert or you hit a mountain range or you hit a

river, you stop moving and you're trapped, and then you die.

So dinosaurs were, yeah, the worst possible

combination. They were mostly big and they were mostly on

land, and yeah, it's not really surprising they did very badly out of it.

- And then some species did survive. I

guess I think you've said that it's very possible that some dinosaurs even

survived for a time.

- Oh, w-

- ...that we might be able to discover down the line.

- I'd be amazed if they didn't. I mean, there's been various reports over the

decades of the- the

K-Pg or K-T extinction, the Cretaceous- Paleogene or Cretaceous-Tertiary

extinction of dinosaurs surviving and none of them have held up. It's

usually been bioturbation, so literally things like

prairie dogs digging, and of course they'll dig a tooth up and then move it through

the layers, or things like this, or plant roots can move stuff.

Or just soils can get churned up. But

I would be shocked if they didn't. Not like, "Oh, yeah, the

dinosaur survived, and the Loch Ness Monster, and stuff like that." But like,

yes, it was a global devastation. Yes, it's what ultimately killed the

dinosaurs, but I'd be amazed if there wasn't some equivalent of Hawaii or New

Zealand or some other tucked away island or valley where

actually dinosaurs were fine for anything from a few hundred thousand to a

couple of million years. But on a global scale, it's a dot on a

map and the odds that we'll ever uncover

any rocks, fossiliferous rocks of that age that we then have

access to that we then find a dinosaur in that we can then date properly,

I think, is almost non-existent. But it would just be weird if

they didn't survive somewhere for a bit, or even quite a few of them in places.

- So a small, local population.

- We see it all the time, you know, the lemurs in Madagascar,

all the stuff in New Zealand. There's tons of weird archaic stuff hanging around.

in Hawaii, you know, Galapagos finches and tortoises, the

tortoises that you don't see anywhere else. In Australia, with the marsupials, they're

almost, and then the monotremes are almost unknown outside of there.

This is a pretty normal bit of biology. For animals that were so dominant globally

we know there were patches that were largely unchanged, otherwise we wouldn't have had the mammals

surviving and the crocodiles surviving and the birds surviving and ever- and newts

and frogs and everything that did survive. I'm sure a few of those

patches had some dinosaurs in them, but it is ultimately what killed them.

- What do you think is the chance that they would have survived? So you take some local

populations and they flourish.

- It's happened. Look at Australia. You know, the

marsupials have done pretty well there for a very long

time. You can imagine if the next mass

extinction, you know, flattens a large chunk of

Indonesia, for example, kangaroos could island

hop pretty easily, make it to mainland Asia.

- But then, I mean, to then lead... You take the

dinosaurs... a small fraction survives and then they eventually

# Chapter 18

- What do you think is the chance that they would have survived? So you take some local

populations and they flourish.

- It's happened. Look at Australia. You know, the

marsupials have done pretty well there for a very long

time. You can imagine if the next mass

extinction, you know, flattens a large chunk of

Indonesia, for example, kangaroos could island

hop pretty easily, make it to mainland Asia.

- But then, I mean, to then lead... You take the

dinosaurs... a small fraction survives and then they eventually

repopulate the earth again.

- I mean, that's extraordinarily unlikely, because once your population's been crashed like

that, you do have the problems of things like inbreeding, or maybe you're

a great specialist to a certain area, or you're surviving because you're

isolated, you're in a valley, or you're on an island, and then

dispersing again becomes really, or breaking out into those areas

becomes much, much harder.

- So like the great predators like the... Even though the T-rex is such a great

predator, that doesn't give you...

- Yeah, because you still had the extinction event, and the

environment is no longer what it was that you evolved into.

- Right.

- And once those systems start to recover, those other animals are going to adapt

much better to them.

- How does that make you feel that, that this stupid asteroid from nowhere?

- Well, I mean, at one level I probably wouldn't be here if it hadn't.

- So, I mean, that's an interesting question. I mean, do you think... There's several ways of asking that

question, but if dinosaurs didn't go extinct, do you think

humans would still be able to evolve?

- I mean, my guess is probably not. I don't think it's quite

the... What was it? Oh, Simon Conway

Morris had that book. What was it? Inevitability of Man. That like even if you

rewound it, everything would come back. I'm not...

I don't think it's that far. I certainly don't think it's

anything quite like the butterfly effect of, you know, if

one mammal had been trodden on by one T-rex, then humans would never have

evolved either.

- We should say that the ancestor of the primates, or the

closest... There's a lot of debate around this, it's a kind of tiny

creature, Purgatorius, that was our

ancestor. Yeah, so this is us. This is what we evolved from.

- Yes. Scandentia, I think, is the group.

- Basically a rodent.

- Yeah, I mean there were probably primates around in the Cretaceous. Some

of the molecular clock stuff suggests that primates were around

alongside the dinosaurs, but we've never found any

osteological evidence of that. But yeah, there's been a

back and forth about were dinosaurs already on their way out, or were they a bit

limited by the very end Cretaceous. I think the more recent

analyses have shown that's probably not the case, because in other words, they were basically doing

fine right up to the extinction event. And so,

yeah, if the asteroid hadn't hit, there's no reason to think that they were on

some kind of terminal decline. Something else may have hit. There may have been,

you know, some other environmental disaster or something may have happened,

or maybe they're more vulnerable to stuff than we know of,

but there's no... I don't think there's any really good reason to think

they wouldn't have carried on relatively well. I mean, even

post-dinosaur extinction, you had a window where the mammals and the birds were

pretty competing. There was a lot of big birds getting going and various big

carnivorous, terrestrial, kind of hyper-predatory

ostrich-like things, like the phorusrhacids. So there's no

guarantee that mammals would have even taken over post the dinosaur

extinction, since initially they were in a fair bit of competition.

- So is it just going to... Based on current scientific understanding, human evolution would be

highly improbable if dinosaurs hadn't gone extinct 66 million years ago,

because dinosaurs dominated ecological niches.

- For everything, basically.

- Wide-bodied mammals.

- I mean, that's the thing. You look through the Mesozoic, the late

Triassic, dinosaurs are there alongside a whole bunch of other

big and unusual and interesting reptiles and some other

early pre-mammal-like things that are closer to mammals than the reptiles.

But once you've gotten into the Jurassic, you've now got a solid

like 120, 130 million years where almost anywhere on Earth, if you saw an animal

bigger than like a raccoon, it was probably a dinosaur. That's how

incredibly dominant they... You know, as dominant, if not more dominant than

modern mammals.

- But is it fair to say that they were mostly dumb?

- I don't think so, 'cause I think that comes down to

A) that bit of kind of classic, almost Victorian

speciesism, and you get these insane hypotheses

like dinosaurs as a species or as a lineage became senile, so they

forgot to breed. I know it's literally a suggested idea.

You know, the mammals ate their eggs and all of this kind of stuff. Dinosaurs only lived

alongside mammals for 100 million years. It'd be weird if they all went extinct at the

same time because suddenly egg eating evolved. You know, you've

got problems like this. But also, again, that general

speciesism, which, you know, even goes back to Linnaeus and his taxonomic

ranks, and even arguably stuff like Aristotle, you've got like, you know,

humans are superior in some way and we're superior to the

other mammals. And of course, mammals are closest to us, so they must be quite

good. And then they've got to be better than lizards, and then

lizards have to be better than frogs, and frogs have to be better than fish. So

that gets you into the, "Well, reptiles must be stupid." And they're not.

- I wonder if a human intelligence level organism could have evolved from the

dinosaurs.

- I mean, it's... That's been hypothesized plenty of times. Dale Russell, a

Canadian paleontologist, the famous guy who came up with this human-like

troodontid that was done for a TV

documentary. I think the one that Christopher Reeve narrated. That, I think is

a remake, but I've seen the original that Dale had made for his TV show

and it's still... It's sitting in the collections of the

National Museum of Nature in Ottawa, for Canada. It's really,

really cool. It's like this five-foot tall dinosauroid. That was it there on the

screen.

- "Model of the hypothetical dinosauroid and display at the dinosaur museum in Dorchester."

- Oh, Dorchester. That's in England. Yeah, I knew there were a couple of copies of it.

Troodon always comes back as the most intelligent dinosaur because it has really quite a

big brain for its size. It does have a high encephalization

quotient, so it's always been tagged as a very good candidate

for being the smartest dinosaur. And basically, he just hybridized that with a

human. But of course, why would these things end up as plantigrade

quadrupeds, and why would they go back to five fingers and... Actually, I think he's only got three, to be

fair, but he's got very human-like feet. Why has it got no tail? Why would those

things suddenly disappear? There's no real reason other than just kind of

human exceptionalism. But like, I mean, you could argue some parrots, some crows are

phenomenally intelligent and show extremely clever

behaviors on par with apes. So at

some level, some dinosaurs were extremely intelligent.

- I mean, yeah, this is a whole other conversation, but all the tiny details that lead

to the explosion that is in our evolutionary

tree that is Homo sapiens. Like what is it? Opposable thumbs,

right? Is it the invention of fire and the meat-eating? Is it-

... is it some other-

- And fighting and sociality and-

- So many-

- predation pressure, and then the changing environment. I mean, the shrinking of the

forest, pushing apes out of the trees into the environment, or into

the open environment.

- And probably the same kind of story could be told about the dinosaurs or about anything

really.

- Yeah, I mean, you...

- There's no reason...

- I mean, if you have 160 million years and a global

domination. But I mean, this is the thing. You talked about lost behaviors, but

like the lost lineages. I wrote about this in one of my books, and like, you want to

find... You want a weird animal, you go to a volcanic

island. You go to New Zealand, you go to Hawaii, you go to the

Galapagos, and yet those are the places that basically don't really form fossils.

So you think the dinosaurs we know about are strange. What

was the stuff knocking around there? We're never going to

know, sadly. But for everything you think

weird... You know, you think birds are cool. Think about penguins compared to your

average bird. They live on an ice shelf for six months of the year and can't

fly, and massively modified skeletons. You know, compared to your average bird,

penguins are unbelievably weird. So yeah, take an average

dinosaur and take it to penguin level or ostrich

level or hummingbird level evolution.

There's going to be weirder stuff out there than we've found. Much weirder.

- If you travel back in time, your mind will probably be blown by the weirdness.

- Yeah.

- Yeah.

- Because those things are almost always in small, isolated

places that don't preserve fossils very well, and so the odds of

us ever coming across them... I mean, you see it to a degree. So you've got,

the stuff that comes out of what is modern Transylvania,

what was Transylvania Hateg. That's that

was a series of islands in the Mediterranean at the end of the Cretaceous,

and some of the weirdest dinosaurs are from that chain of islands. And

that's not very isolated compared to, again, something like Hawaii or New

Zealand. But it's fitting the exact pattern. You get dinosaurs on

islands, they turn weird. We see that. So again, dinosaurs were real animals.

Again, it sounds really painfully obvious, but they weren't monsters. They followed

the same... Rules might be pushing it, but certainly, like, guidelines.

Ecology operates in certain ways. If you're bigger, you need more

food. But you're more efficient. You just are. That's pretty

much just physics and scaling. So big dinosaurs are going to follow

the rules of bigger animals, and small dinosaurs are going to follow the rules of smaller animals.

They just will. Quite how they violate it in certain

ways, by having unusually long necks or

unusual physiology, or eating an unusual diet, or because there was a

weird plant that was alive then that isn't now, or whatever it may be. There's

# Chapter 19

Again, it sounds really painfully obvious, but they weren't monsters. They followed

ways, by having unusually long necks or

unusual physiology, or eating an unusual diet, or because there was a

weird plant that was alive then that isn't now, or whatever it may be. There's

obviously a huge amount of variation and uncertainty. But

fundamentally, we know what makes animals and ecosystems

work, and dinosaurs were animals in ecosystems. They're

not that strange at some level, and therefore reconstructing their actual biology

is challenging, but far from impossible.

- Strange question. As everybody knows, dragons are obviously real.

- I've been asked that on live TV before. Only not with the sarcastic tone, so...

- Do you dare disagree? ...with this notion?

- Yes, I do. They don't.

- Well...

- And again, I...

- They're real to me, so...

- That's fine. But again, you know, we kind of touched on it, but

I think there's probably very little of any kind

of paleontological law that ended up in

things like Chinese culture, with the Chinese dragons and all of that stuff. That one comes up

repeatedly. The only one I do know of, again, from Alberta,

is buffalo stones that the...

apparently some of the Native Americans had, which are actually bits of

ammonites. So ammonites, they're curly, spiral-shelled

cephalopods that are related to octopus and squid. So they have all these

little segments to the shells, and the right species... And when they break

open, they have, like, two little pairs of legs and

then a bulge and then a little bulge, and it looks very roughly like a

bison. And apparently these were

thought to be, like, somehow miniature bison. They're very rare

because ironically, although the dinosaur bones are extremely common,

it was very swampy, so you didn't actually have a lot of sea coming in,

so you didn't tend to get things like ammonites and ocean-going animals. And then the shell would

have to break in the right way. But apparently for the local tribes, like

Sáptəṉilh, I don't remember who it is in that bit of Canada... But yeah, these were

quite valued. If you've got a buffalo stone. And I've seen a

couple of them, and yeah, you have to squint a bit, but as a little buffalo, it's not

far off. But yeah, but that whole, like, were they

finding mammoth legs and were they finding T-rexes, and was this inspiration

for this animal or this mystical animal? I don't think they were,

because you just don't tend to find them like that.

- So where do you think, like... You know, 'cause dragons show up in a bunch of different myths.

- Well, right. But that's the thing, they turn up in British mythology, and we've barely got any

dinosaurs here at all. You only find them when you start digging for

coal mines, which we weren't doing in...

- Is it basically a dramatization of like of snakes and lizards and stuff like this?

- Yeah, and just general exaggeration and welding stuff together.

I mean, that's one thing you could, I guess, potentially argue is

that, you know, yeah, we find tyrannosaurs in North America and in East

Asia. In fact, there's a whole bunch of stuff in the Early Cretaceous, which is often very common,

'cause it's all relatively recent in the grand scheme of things in the history of the

world. The fauna of East Asia:

China, Mongolia, Eastern Russia, is very similar to what you get in Canada or in the

USA and down in Mexico. And so

you find the same rough stuff. They may not be exactly the same, but you get

ceratopsians, you get tyrannosaurs, you get the big-edged archosaurs, you get

ankylosaurs, the armored ones, this, that, and the other. So if

these were influencing all those different cultures—

...why don't Chinese dragons look like Mexican dragons or

equivalent thunderbirds or whatever? Well, because it probably wasn't influencing

them. If they were all seeing the same skeleton, they'd probably all

produce the same kind of mythical animals. They all produce—

- Well, uh—

- ...different ones.

- You have to understand, paleontology's not perfect, so they were just misinterpreting it.

- Misinterpreting, yeah.

- I mean, dragons aside, I'm sure, like we said with weirdness, there would

be creatures

that would be remarkable, right? That you look at it and you might as well

be seeing a dragon. It could be—

And I mean, there are creatures alive in the sea today.

- Yeah, I mean if you dredged up a colossal squid, I think you'd have—

You know, or even just dugongs and manatees. I mean, they're really quite strange.

- And if you allow yourself to marvel at the small things on Earth, like I was in the

Amazon jungle, like the insects, they're just like, "What is—"

...happening there? There are so many things going on.

Oh, they're like hairy and colorful, and probably

poisonous, and they have teeth, and what? And they're just— And they're long and—

- Well, and all the little weirdos. I've, I've—

several times I've pitched a book to publishers where I want to write a book

that basically makes the point that there is almost

nothing— I mean, you can always dream up something totally ludicrous— There is basically

nothing in science fiction that doesn't already exist on Earth in some way, shape, or

form.

- Yeah, that is why I'll think about alien civilizations and aliens out there, and

I'm very, very certain that there are aliens everywhere

throughout the observable universe. It's very strange we haven't seen

them, but it's fun to marvel at what they

possibly look like, because there's a huge variety

of organisms and species here on Earth, and you just expand that out—

...to like more and more Earths, and you can just imagine there's a lot of weird—

- Well, that's the thing. I think most people, you know, understandably...

I'm a biologist, and I particularly pride myself on finding out about

particularly weird animals. But yeah, I think people would be stunned

about some of the weird stuff that's out there that they just wouldn't

realize are real. You know, things like velvet worms.

You know, it's just, it'll blow your mind. You know,

caecilians and stuff like this and their reproductive behavior. It's just

jaw-dropping. I mean, I love teaching about them. I do a class on diversity of

life, and it's about eight weeks of vertebrate diversity, and I love

just dropping things in, and the students are like, "What do you mean that exists?

What do you mean something like that's normal for this group?" Yeah, they do that.

- Well, what from that class, but everything you've studied with the

dinosaurs, what have you learned about the

evolution of life on Earth, that mechanism?

- It's really good. It sounds obvious, but it's... I think

the bit that still fries my brain is just like the raw numbers, because

I think we're very bad at considering... Like, I

regularly talk about, "Oh, this is 70 million years old, but this is 78, and this is

104." And people are just like, "Oh my God, how on Earth do you deal with

those numbers?" And I don't. They're just numbers,

because I can't conceive of it really any better than you

can. They are astronomical. Yeah, last Thursday was quite a long time ago.

66 million years is mind-boggling. I can't fathom it.

I can't fathom it. But that's it. I think

the evolution thing is, A, my suspicion is quite a lot of it

happens... It's not quite Stephen Gould's punctuated equilibrium, but I think

stressful events probably prompt a lot more than

less stressful events. You know, population crashes and all these

things that then...

Odd things survive, and then that's changing your genetic component and all the rest of it.

But you've just got to remember that it's almost a numbers

game. You know, it's that bad analogy of like, "Oh yeah,

evolution is just rolling dice and hoping you get all sixes." And it's like, no, a friend of mine said,

"No, it's rolling dice, but it gets to keep the sixes." And then suddenly getting a

hat full of sixes isn't that hard, but also you're in the context

of even rare species, you know, ultra-rare,

short of stuff that like we've nearly killed off, but very rare

species have populations in the thousands or hundreds of thousands.

And are probably around for hundreds of thousands of years.

Very few, other than a few things like whales and apes and

elephants, mostly have dozens or thousands of offspring at a

time. So a few thousand animals that have a few thousand

offspring aligned for a few hundred thousand years... Yeah, it's billions and

billions and billions of them. And that's the

rare stuff. You look at Mola mola, the ocean sunfish, though I

think Mola has just been split up into like five species. It's one of the

weirdest-looking animals. I love it, love it, love it.

I mean, what a fish that is. Swims with a giant dorsal and

I think it's a giant anal fin, and then they flap alternatingly.

- Does it have a face? Yeah.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Little one at the front. Ate jellyfish. Super

open-oceanic. And they get really big. You can see that one with the diver.

But I think these are the record breeders for animals, and they have something like 100

million eggs at a time.

- Whoa.

- Don't quote me on that, but it is something in those kinds of numbers.

So yeah, you don't need a very large population of

sunfish to start having an awful lot

of numbers. Are you gonna Google it and see if you can

find it? Number of eggs or something? Yeah. 300 million. Oh, I under- I-

- A single fe-

- I undercut it.

- A single female can release up to 300 million eggs at one time during a

spawning event. Boy. These eggs are incredibly small, measuring

about 1.3 millimeters in diameter.

- That's still a lot of egg size when you think about it.

- It's not that small.

- Yeah. 300 million of one mil is still quite a bit.

- Fertilization is external.

- Yeah, it's-

- Females release their eggs into the water, where males then fertilize

them. Wow. Man, there's a lot of different ways to have sex, I guess. This is-

- Yeah. But that's the bit of evolution that I

think, I understand why people don't get it. We are

mostly talking about millions in population

times millions of years times thousands of offspring.

Yeah. It's kind of a numbers game. Well, how could this evolve?

With the right selective pressure, and when you've got 100 billion offspring,

# Chapter 20

- Fertilization is external.

- Yeah, it's-

- Females release their eggs into the water, where males then fertilize

them. Wow. Man, there's a lot of different ways to have sex, I guess. This is-

- Yeah. But that's the bit of evolution that I

think, I understand why people don't get it. We are

mostly talking about millions in population

times millions of years times thousands of offspring.

Yeah. It's kind of a numbers game. Well, how could this evolve?

With the right selective pressure, and when you've got 100 billion offspring,

probably a few of them have that.

- And when you focus in on a single species and trace its history,

you can see how effective evolution is, natural selection is. And then you just have to,

like, go across species and you're gonna realize-

- Yeah, but it's also a massive compromise, which is the bit that people always miss.

You know, it's Darwin's line, "It's descent with

modification." Yes, over time, you can end up

with extraordinarily weird things, but mostly what's happening is you're changing

something fairly simple.

- Yeah.

- You're making edits to the existing plan,

which is why you don't have animals with tentacles.

They have legs, which have joints, which have fingers, and they all have one bone,

then two bones, then a bunch of little blocky bones, and then a few more,

and then the little ones that make up the digits for hands and feet, and basically everything has that-

... because you're modifying that pattern. And occasionally you'll get something weird,

like most of the modern lungfish have basically reduced those down to-

well, they had a more simple plan to begin with, but reduced it down to a stump, and then they've got something

like a flaily tentacle. But

yeah, you know, snakes have gotten rid of them, all of the various legless lizards and things like that,

and again, caecilians, and all the rest. But yet, you're- you're

subtly changing certain things in certain ways is mostly what's going on, and then

those build up over time. But also, again, it's that compromise of

there's things that do and don't work. There's things that are interlinked, so you can't

modify A without modifying B. Modifying A will kill

you, therefore B never modifies, because the two are genetically

linked in some way. Or yeah, like the compromise of the

lion's mane. Making it darker makes you sexier, but more likely to kill you.

I think people think evolution is like,

perfecting things in some way. And they're not. They're bodge

jobs, you know? That's why we have a blind spot in our eye, but

things like squid don't.

- But that process, nevertheless, does have inventions in it. You have Tiktaalik. You

have a fish that learns to breathe, that crawls out.

- Yeah, but it already had a swim bladder that it was probably processing a minimal amount of

oxygen through, and the swim bladder evolved for a certainly different function.

- Yeah, but that's one of the powerful things... ...About evolution.

... evolution. It switches the function.

It develops it for one function, but once you once you get there, you're like, "Oh, okay, this

could be used for another function," that- that leads to something that

we, in retrospect, can see as a major invention, which is-

... a fish that's able to crawl on land, and all of a sudden-

- Yep, absolutely.

- ...we have- we have cities and... ...And rockets, and yeah. Tiktaalik specifically,

like, there's something really, like, mind-boggling about a

fish that crawls out of the sea, and you just the image of that.

- Yeah, but again, you've got stuff that's not a million miles away from that.

You have things like frogfish, which are fully marine,

but kinda clamber through seaweed and stuff, and they've

got pseudo-functional limbs. It's again, it's that

...Tiktaalik is not a weirdly derived frogfish, but it's not like

it's a fish that suddenly came on land or a fish that suddenly evolved legs. There was already

that selective pressure that was pushing it into a new opportunity, which gave it an-

and then on and on and on, and that's what keeps going. But it also brings up another thing, going

back to dinosaurs and the behavior stuff, which, again, I think has been a

problem, is the functionality thing,

and how there's always been, I think, this big perception

of single traits having single functions,

which isn't how a huge amount of biology works. For some, yeah. Like, eyes

are used for seeing. They don't really do anything else. But I

think there's a lot of- again, it comes down to a lot of the sexual selection stuff, but things like

horns on Triceratops. That's probably quite good for fighting off predators, but it's

also quite good for fighting other Triceratops.

And then things like elephants dig with their tusks as well as fight other elephants,

as well as fight lions, as well as stripping the bark off trees. So,

you've got to be very careful about how you think of functionality in

two different ways. One way is, what possible things

could that thing do and what possible things could

have been the main selective pressure before. So, you think

about elephant tusks. As I say, they do all these different things. But when an elephant's just

got the tiniest-

little nubs, like the first elephant whose teeth are growing the wrong

way and have pushed out of its jaw, and now it's got a couple of little

spikes, it can't really dig a hole

with them. It's certainly not digging for water. They're

probably not great against a predator, because you'd basically have to get on your knees to try and lean

over and try and stab it a bit. But you can show off to the girls,

and you can immediately find another elephant who's head-to-head the same height as

you, and you've got a massive advantage. So,

evolutionarily, they probably started as some kind of

sexually selected feature. But now,

functionally, they are probably compromised by the fact that

having the best fighting tusks, but also having the tusks that are best at

digging up water to keep you alive during a drought,

is putting selective pressure on that.

And those are, are those selections, sexual selection appears in both

ends. Those are two different things. Digging for water is

critical, but it's probably not what started it. And I think that's where we get

trapped with things

like, say, the paddle tail of Spinosaurus or stuff like, or you know, or T-rex

arms. It's like, well, why are T-rex arms like that? Well, maybe we

need to consider what a slightly longer arm is like or what it was being functioned for in its

ancestors or how it works in other species or what else it might

do, rather than every paper is like, "Did it do this," or,

"Did it do this," or, "Did it do this?" It's like, you know, it could be all of them.

That's-

a very different question to try and answer, but people don't tend to think of it.

And it ends up being very binary. And again, biology is not like that,

because it's a compromise.

- And it may be wiser to then look at the evolutionary origins, how it first

sprung up.

- Yeah, if you, yeah. You know, what does a

miniaturized version of this look like, and what might that function for? Or,

how does it function in ancestral forms? You know, a really good example of that is

giraffe necks, which have been argued about, you know, forever and a day. It

was, "Giraffe necks are to help them feed up high." And then in the late

'90s, early 2000s, there's a couple of papers coming out going, "Actually, maybe it's

sexual selection and competition." And then that drove down into

arguments about, "Well, what does a short neck look like? And the okapi is the nearest

relative. And what do short legs look like, and how do they work?" And plus a whole bunch of

other studies. And ultimately, it came out that we were right the first time. This is all about

feeding. But it's a really interesting way of thinking about it and looking at it.

- Gotta ask you the ridiculous question. We do have dinosaurs here on Earth today.

They're birds.

- Yep. 10 and a half, 11,000 species of dinosaur.

- Are birds dinosaurs?

- Yes.

- Yeah, there's not...

- It's, it's-

- Wild?

- It's just a yes. Yeah.

- How many people know this, by the way?

- So there's, there's an interesting one. I did a radio show, oh, it's probably

seven or eight years ago now, with a couple of prese- you know, drive time

afternoon, nothing serious, nothing science, or anything like that. I mentioned something like this.

And one presenter was, "Oh my God, what do you mean birds are dinosaurs?"

And the other one is, "What do you mean you don't know birds are dinosaurs?"

So it's hitting that tipping point of common knowledge, I think, where...

Does everyone know? No. But I think an awful lot of people know and are now used to it.

as an idea.

- So what's the evolutionary connection between birds and dinosaurs?

- They literally are, in the same way that we are apes and mammals. Birds are

dinosaurs. The direct, if you trace back the

evolution of all the birds, so hummingbirds and

albatross and ostrich and kiwi and parrots and pelicans and penguins

and whatever else, and take them down to their ancestral point, and then

go back quite a few more million years, the nearest

relatives to them is a dinosaur. It is actually something very close to

Velociraptor or at least a small version of Velociraptor.

So birds have literally descended from dinosaurs, therefore

they are dinosaurs. We have literally descended from other apes, we are apes.

It is that form of evolutionary connection.

- Throughout that whole process, did they have feathers, or did feathers come and go?

- Feathers are in tyrannosaurs. Feathers go back at least...

So, ironically, because the fossil record is very incomplete, most of the things

that are closest to birds we know from the early and late Cretaceous,

so the last kind of 50 million years of dinosaur evolution,

up to the extinction. And actually, birds almost certainly go back another

50 million years. So birds did not appear as a result of the dinosaurs going

So birds did not appear as a result of the dinosaurs going

extinct. Birds lived alongside the dinosaurs for 100 million years. This was, the

birds were not new on the scene. It's not like, "Oh, the dinosaurs died, and from

the ashes rose the birds." No, they've been knocking around forever.

No, they've been knocking around forever.

- They just survived 'cause they're small.

- In a very large part, yeah. That's almost certainly what really

helped them. Birds took a kicking in the KT extinction.

So did mammals. Loads of bird lineages went extinct, and only a handful got over the

line, but they did. We have feathers, as I said, we've got Middle Jurassic

tyrannosaurs that are 165 million years.

old, so 100 million years before the extinction, that have

feathers. Simple feathers, they'd be like those you get on most baby chicks,

so they're not with the big kind of

classic pick up a feather in, you know, in the street or on a field, the big vein

up the middle and then the kind of paired flat pieces. This

would be much more like a hair. But we have them.

We've got something which is very close to a bird, but might not quite be a

bird, with modern feathers. In

the Middle Jurassic, we've got definitive stuff like Archaeopteryx in the Late

# Chapter 21

tyrannosaurs that are 165 million years.

old, so 100 million years before the extinction, that have

feathers. Simple feathers, they'd be like those you get on most baby chicks,

so they're not with the big kind of

classic pick up a feather in, you know, in the street or on a field, the big vein

up the middle and then the kind of paired flat pieces. This

would be much more like a hair. But we have them.

We've got something which is very close to a bird, but might not quite be a

bird, with modern feathers. In

the Middle Jurassic, we've got definitive stuff like Archaeopteryx in the Late

Jurassic, and then into the early Cretaceous we have a series of fossil beds in

China which are just heaving with them. So yeah, and

tyrannosaurs have feathers. Velociraptor and the

Dromaeosaurs had feathers. Troodontids had feathers. Ornithomimosaurs, we've

mentioned, they had feathers, and so did a whole bunch of other groups as well.

There's about eight or nine major

groups, kind of the size of something like, yeah, literally like

carnivores or deer. You know, some

massive groups. About eight or nine of them were fully feathered, as far

as we can tell. So feathers massively predate bird

origins, but it was a major part of their evolution.

- Do I understand why feathers evolved with the function,

the, the sexual selection, the signaling?

- Yeah, it's probably a fundamental twofold one, which is feathers

insulate you. They keep you warm. And most dinosaurs were,

it's an archaic term, but it's what most people know, warm-blooded. So they were

much more like us and birds. They had a stable high body temperature regardless

of the environmental conditions. So if you're burning a lot of calories to stay warm,

you want to kind of keep that heat, and feathers really help you do that.

And then the other thing is, yeah, the obvious thing is sexual selection

and communication. Feathers do stuff that scales can't. You can

shed them in winter and change color and come back as another one. That's

quite a handy trick. You can change them between juveniles and adults. So baby

birds have one type of feather, adults have a different one. We know of dinosaurs

that do that, where we've got adults and juveniles with different feather types

preserved in the fossils. Yeah, you can produce all kinds of weird colors

and displays. You can erect feathers. You can hold them up and fan them out

like a peacock or a pheasant. Whereas scales, you can't really do that, or

you need a huge amount of bone like Protoceratops. So

there's two good reasons that they would probably evolve, and

exactly pulling them apart or which is more important. And again-

they're probably bifunctional. As soon as you start making feathers and making

them more colorful, well, you're staying warmer. So that's an advantage. Or as soon

as you start making feathers to make them warmer, it probably won't be long until

someone evolves them to be a bit brighter red. And then we're back to, "Oh my God, red."

Right? But that's what's happening.

And then they're probably gonna push each other potentially.

- I mean, it is true that the birds went real crazy with the

feather and the colors and the prettiness and all that.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah. They absolutely do.

- I mean, maybe there's something about feathers that allows for that efficient

sort of diversification of fashion.

- I think, yeah, I think it gives them opportunities that...

...scales and solid structures simply don't.

- Yeah, it could be a material for it.

- The sole ability, I mean, I say peacocks and pheasants, they are at a massive

disadvantage, and males have got these extra plumes because they're so big and heavy.

Peacocks can barely fly. But the fact is, you can still kind of fold them up into a

fairly neat package and kind of hide if you really wanted to. Whereas if you're

something like a Triceratops, that billboard stuck on the top of your

head is not only enormous but also

bone. It's massive, it's heavy, and you've got to...

- No hiding.

- ...hide it around the whole year. Whereas peacocks at least can go, "Well, all the

girls have settled down on their nests now, I'm just going to get rid of all this extra

weight and dump it."

- Just looking at the entire history of Earth, what has studying

hundreds of millions of years of evolution, studying

this epic age of the dinosaurs, what has that done for your

appreciation of what makes Earth beautiful? Do you ever just

like sit back and think, "Holy shit, this is incredible, this whole thing"?

- Yeah, yeah, I do. But I guess maybe not much more so than I would anyway.

As in, I already... because again, I don't really think of

myself as a paleontologist in a lot of ways. Um,

it's not that I don't love my work, but it's,

I'm a biologist, and this is what I'm looking at. But I'm fascinated and

amazed by lungfish and flying frogs and

caterpillars and onychophorans and butterflies and a million and one

other hagfish and things that I think are cool and interesting and fascinating, and I could

happily read about them or watch them in a zoo or a documentary or

whatever it may be, almost every bit as much

as I would with dinosaurs. I probably appreciate the dinosaurs and pterosaurs

in a very different way because I have such a greater intimate knowledge of the

science, in a way that I try and read the lion literature because I'm really

interested in predation dynamics, but I can't keep up with it whilst doing all the other

stuff as well.

- Predation dynamics. Awesome.

- Well, right, so like the difference of what prey are they taking? Why? At what

percentage? What influences? How are they competing with leopards and...

- Wait, there's a body of literature on this?

- Yeah, people are studying lions, what they hunt, what they eat, and where they do it, and

there's a whole bunch of stuff on particularly the

African carnivores, because there are so many of them and they're so big, and their

populations aren't terrible compared to like

South America or North America or a lot of Asia, for example. Um,

But yeah, going back to your question, I can appreciate all of it. It's all

cool. Some of it is definitely more awesome than others. I work on some

of the giant pterosaurs, the ones with 10-meter wingspans.

Yeah, and it's, it's hard. My partner's family is from Uganda.

We were in Uganda last year. I was watching marabou storks

circle overhead and you're like, "Wow, these things are huge and amazing."

And then I'm like, "Their wingspan is about a fifth of the stuff I work on."

Their wingspan is about a fifth of the stuff I work on."

Actually, these are quite piddly in the grand scheme, you know,

this thing being like an airliner going overhead. And when you think about it

in that context, yeah, I mean,

because that's it with the... you know, I know people tend to be obsessed with size.

You kind of get it. Like blue whales are...

fundamentally cooler than smaller humpback whales, even if humpback whales are cool.

It's hard not to be impressed by Patagotitan or

Tyrannosaurus or Triceratops or Quetzalcoatlus or any of these

ultimate giants. There's a reason we love great white sharks, there's a reason we love

giant squid. There's a reason we love lions and grizzly bears and stuff.

But the dinosaurs do kind of do it better than anyone else

or, you know, marine reptiles and the flying reptiles, because it's just so insane.

- Yeah, both size and diversity.

- Yeah, and longevity as well. I mean, you look

at, you know, elephants have come and gone, and the whales,

okay, the whales have reached superlative sizes, but they're relatively new on the

scene. Could easily have gone extinct in the last

century. But yeah, you know, there's truly

titanic dinosaurs for at least 100 million years.

- It's a long time. It's hard sometimes, and as you said, it's very hard to

load in just how long that is. They really dominated Earth for a very long time.

- Yeah, and almost absolutely everywhere. There's a handful of places that we've

found where it appears that dinosaurs didn't really get in, and something else

kind of took over, you know, like Australia with the marsupials versus the

other eutherians. But yeah, fundamentally, it was a dinosaur planet for...

After the Triassic, less so the end of the Triassic when they're first getting going.

But yeah, Jurassic and Cretaceous, yeah, it's 140-ish million years

of, yeah, just absolute dominance.

- I think it's hilarious and just perfect that there's a giant

dinosaur head next to you, and you didn't mention it once during this conversation.

- Because I thought we'd get it. Well, I mean, giant is an absolute diddy one.

Yeah, so this is Protoceratops andrewsi. I've done loads

of work on Protoceratops. It's from Mongolia. This is a latest

so I've got a big head, and the big head's kind of like this, but I really

but I really couldn't fit it in the bag.

- So this is a to-scale juvenile.

- This is a cast. This is not original, but someone

has molded and copied it. So it's not even, it's not carved.

It's a cast and a mold taken. So yeah,

this is 100% accurate to the original specimen, or at least extraordinarily accurate to

the original specimen.

- So it's a young guy.

- Yeah. But yeah, at full size, it's going to be like

pig or sheep size, so big but not massive.

But I've got it partly because it's affordable, cause I can't afford to buy the

big skeletons and skulls. But I've done a huge amount of work on it, and in part

it goes back to those earlier conversations about

populations. If you really want to understand animals, you need

an understanding of what a real population and a

growth of what these animals looks like. And

Protoceratops is, I would argue, probably the only dinosaur

where we can really do that, or at least as close as possible as

you could get to any modern animal as an analog. We've

got well over 100 good skeletons, though

probably only about 70 or 80 in really accessible

museums, but that's still a hell of a lot. We have everything from, "Here's a tiny baby

one." This is a really cheap and nasty 3D print I had

made but that's a hatchling sized one, or not much bigger than a

hatchling sized one,

all the way up to the big adults. We've now got embryos as well,

which we didn't have until about 10 years ago. So

we've got embryonic animals all the way up to big adults. They're all

pretty much from one place in

Mongolia. And they are, as far as we can tell, from a relatively

narrow window in time, only about 100,000 years, which in the grand scheme of things is very

close.

So you've got one population from one place from one time, with 100 animals from

embryos up to big adults.

- That's okay.

- So now if you want to look at, as I do, something like sexual

selection, and when does growth of the signal kick in and at what size,

and what evidence for dimorphism, well, suddenly you've got a population. You've got

something you can work with. And that's why

# Chapter 22

Mongolia. And they are, as far as we can tell, from a relatively

narrow window in time, only about 100,000 years, which in the grand scheme of things is very

close.

So you've got one population from one place from one time, with 100 animals from

embryos up to big adults.

- That's okay.

- So now if you want to look at, as I do, something like sexual

selection, and when does growth of the signal kick in and at what size,

and what evidence for dimorphism, well, suddenly you've got a population. You've got

something you can work with. And that's why

Protoceratops is so important, and I think way more important

than even a lot of my fellow paleontologists realize, and I genuinely think

we should be pouring a lot more research into them, because they can tell us

stuff that pretty much no other dinosaur can.

- Because you have the population data, so you can...

...you can ask them a lot more questions.

- And we can treat it as a population. So going way, way back to a

conversation about telling males and females apart, and I said the big

problem is population data, or at least the number of

specimens that you have when mostly you've only got one, two, or three.

I did a big study on this a few years ago on gharials, the really long-snouted

crocodilians from Nepal, India, and Pakistan with a giant

bulge on the end of the nose. And even though the males are all bigger than the

females, and the males all have this weird nose growth

that's mostly soft tissue, but they have a weird depression in the jaw, in the

end of the snout where the nostrils sit. We got a sample size

of something like about 110 animals. So these are very,

very rare animals, so we had to ransack every museum worldwide.

I was sending my students sending emails to huge numbers of

people, "Have you got one sitting in your collection lost? Can you get

it for us? Can you take these photos or these measurements? We can measure it." We put the dataset

together, and then we found that actually, apart from

the very biggest males, it's really hard to tell males and

females apart, and this actually really closely matched

some modeling data that I'd done with a colleague, Jordan Malin in Ottawa,

looking at this for alligators and trying to compare it

to dinosaurs. Because we talked about mutual sexual selection before,

neutral sexual selection in particular, you tend to get things that are extremely similar.

Males and females are very hard to tell apart. But there's

also a gradient, you know, all the way up to things like

peacocks, all the way down to you can't tell them apart, like parrots.

And for some features, when they take time to get growing,

or because dinosaurs grow over a very long window and are

sexually mature over a very long window, you run into the problem that

a big female will look like a small male.

And we can't sex them, and lo and behold, this is what you get with the gharials.

The really big males are obvious because they're so much bigger and they've got this big depression in

the snout, but medium-sized and big females look like medium

sized, or smaller males and very small males. And so, yeah,

that's basically what we have with dinosaurs. Even with Protoceratops, where

we've got a dataset of like a hundred,

papers have come out saying there's very mild sexual dimorphism or there isn't

sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism could

be very strong in Protoceratops, but we can't find it because

we can't tell the males from the females because we haven't ID'd

enough through something like medullary bone.

And so you're in this horrible situation where, because going back to the T-Rex thing, is like

well, maybe it's mutual sexual selection and therefore they're cooperating, and

that would be cool. But also, maybe males are much bigger

but we can't tell because our dataset's too small.

- Oh, that's frustrating.

- In which case, they're not under mutual sexual selection, and we've got it all wrong.

Argh! It- It's maddening because it's so

if these were living animals, you'd just watch them or you'd just genotype them

or you'd sex them and you'd just know, and we just

don't. But on the other hand, we do have the mechanism to do it. There

are a handful of places where you get a bunch of Protoceratops together, where it's a mass

mortality site. Well, let's go and drill every bone, because if that's the

breeding season, we might find seven or eight females, and then the others are

pretty much by default males if we know it's the middle of the breeding season because all the

middle of the breeding season because all the others have medullary bone.

Now, let's analyze those two data sets.

And then maybe we'll see a difference and maybe we won't.

- I love how that frustration is a catalyst for figuring it out.

You're searching for a place, a piece of evidence that just shows you clearly.

- There are ways in.

- Yeah, there's ways in.

- This is the thing.

- There's always ways in.

- Yeah, there are ways in. And maybe we got to get lucky

because maybe it's not the breeding season.

Or maybe that was just a group of all males, and therefore

we're not going to get the signal we're looking for.

But there's enough of them, and they're common enough, and yet, still digging in

Mongolia, we keep finding new species. We keep finding new, cooler stuff.

But I'm like, "Can we dig up some more Protoceratops?"

Because actually, however cool these new things are,

genuinely, if you want to know what dinosaurs are and how they worked,

another hundred Protoceratops will actually probably tell us a lot more

than 50 new species, however cool 50 new species might be.

- Paleontology is an incredible discipline. It really is Sherlock Holmes

territory. This was an incredible

conversation. I'm really grateful for all the work you write,

that you put out there.
