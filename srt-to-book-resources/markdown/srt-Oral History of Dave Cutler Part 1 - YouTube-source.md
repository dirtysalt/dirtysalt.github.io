# Chapter 1

i'm grant seever

uh

triced

the computer history museum here with dave cutler in his living room in belleview on a beautiful seattle day

uh

nice weather for a change

the winter may be ending

uh

toh

discuss with dave

his long career in the computer industry

and

um

so we'll

uh

we'll begin

so

uh

uh

we were talking about

uh

before this

your entry into computers

but let's roll back a bit into early childhood and living in michigan and

and

uh

being near the i guess oldsmobile factory and lancing

so tell us a little bit about

uh

your early days and getting high school

and so on

well

i was

um

i grew up in dwit michigan

uh

which is about 10 miles south of or i'm sorry north of lancing

where oos mobile is at

i went to dt high school

um

i was a um

primarily an athlete

not a student

although i had pretty good grades at dt

i was a 16l uh athlete

i played uh

football basketball baseball and ran track

um

and

uh

i'm a michigan state fan

michigan state's was right there in east lancing

so i grew up close to east lancing in michigan state

um

early on

i

um

was very interested in model airplanes and built a lot of model airplanes and wanted to be a pilot

when i grew up

but somehow that just went by the way

and later on i discovered i had motion sickness problems anyway

so that wasn't going to make it

um

so that's pretty much my early

so the model airplanes kind of k

kindled a technical interest in in aviation and flying and and how that worked

uh

well

i

i don't know how i got into model airplanes

there was a local shop that

um

uh

was like a hobby shop that sold model airplanes and i got interested in building them

and then

of course

you know

you keep

you build bigger ones and bigger ones and you try to build powered ones and

and i built the powered ones and and i mostly crashed them

so i don't know if it really fostered a technical interest

but um certainly was something that i was interested in for quite a while

but then kind of sports took over in high school and um

i became more interested in sports

so the sports led to an opportunity to go to do at college

uh

all of at college

i'm sorry

all of at college and u

uh

athletics were a big part of making that possible

weren't they

um

i

in fact i went to al college

um

they offered me

um

pretty much a full ride

i had an academic scholarship and i had uh scholarships

for

basketball

baseball and football

and i would probably not have went to college if i hadn't had a full ride

um

because i we couldn't afford it and i had applied a couple other places

i i really wanted to go to central michigan and um

they didn't accept me

um

and the the thing at olette worked out really well was close to home

um

and that's where i ended up and how did you decide on the course program

that you take all of it

uh

when i got there at allette

i didn't really know

um

i think

like most students

what i really wanted to

uh

study and

um

i

you

know

i

i don't know why i i decided on math

other than it was

it was a a very interesting challenging thing

and then after i got in decided math was my major

then it was natural for me to say

well

i ought to have a lot of physics

so i took a lot of physics and i really enjoyed math and physics

um

i didn't enjoy some of the other things

olette is a liberal arts school

so there was a lot of liberal arts requirements

um

it's also a religiously affiliated school

although really not tightly religiously affiliated

but there was a lot of stuff i had to take that was religious related

um

but i sort of gravitated towards the math and the physics

and

uh

it worked out

well

great

so that that you know you're

you're progressing through college and thinking about what's next

what where where the career might lead

where you might go to work

uh

how did that prog any jobs during college

by the way

uh

did i have any jobs during college

the answerers

no

i

i had

um

i was so busy playing sports and um

later on

i

you know

the first

the first two years of college

i played mostly sports and studied just enough to get by and keep my academic scholarship

and then the last two years

i really you might say applied myself and

uh

try to um

be a good student

what happened to me was

um

within a span of 18 months

i had my right knee operated on and they pulled out the medial miniscus

i broke my left leg

and then i had my left leg operated on and they pulled out the medial miniscus there

so i was pretty much done with sports at the end of two years

and during those two years

i think that i mainly thought about that

that

you know

i never thought that it was

it was really going to end that i was going to be

you know

i just thinking about

well

i'm just going to be playing sports forever

and then

after two years

it's sort of like

well

i'm not going to be playing sports forever

what do i really want to do

and so i'm really not sure what i really want to do

but i think i really like math and i like physics and i'm a uh

hands-on kind of person that likes to build things

so i really think that i would like to have some kind of an engineering job somewhere

so i was sort of aiming at

um

an engineering job

not going to an engineering school in

uh

a time era where it was possible that such a thing could happen

uh

today

that would probably be kind of like

uh

pretty remote that somebody could do that

i mean if you had a math degree

you probably wouldn't step into a mechanical engineering job or something like that

um

of course

you could

you could step into a computer engineering job

computer engineers

um

a lot of different disciplines make good computer engineers

um

so

anyway

my

my goal

um

in the last few years was to finish my degree and find an engineering job

and and how did that go

i mean you

did you start interviewing companies

companies come to the campus

or

uh

in those days

um

the companies didn't come to the campuses

you

we're talking 1965 and uh

at least they didn't come to our campus and and i i just mainly applied to um

a lot of different companies

i applied to

uh

lock heat and and the aerospace companies

and i applied to general motors

and i

you know

i applied to dupont

uh

i don't know how i happened to apply to dupont

i i saw a ad somewhere probably or something

and

um

sort of waited for people to come back

and you know

say

hey

we want to interview you

it turned out that i

i ended up actually having three solid job offers

one was from chrysler in a soft trim plant

uh

which was um door panels and soft soft trim in a

in an automobile is basically the inside and i would be a

uh

they

the job

there was a time and studies

kind of operations research

kind of job

um

in a town that wasn't too far from where i lived

i had a a a firm offer from os mobile to work in their

uh

computer accounting department

you know

i had an offer from dupont to work there in a job that was supposedly engineering job

so i sort of decided i didn't want to work for o mobile

because i didn't want an accounting job

um

there was

no

you know

i didn't know anything about computer science at that time

and i computers were around and people used them for records keeping and accounting kind of things

and of course there were people at unity

i ities

um

that were using them for other things

but mostly when you talked about computers

the general public knowledge about computers was accounting and records keeping

and that's mostly what the ibm machines were was recordkeeping and accounting

so i decided i didn't want to work there either

and so i decided to to

uh

go to wilmington delaware and take the job with dupont

and was that job

what you expected

uh

was the job

what i expected

no

it was a

it was a life lesson and interviewing

and um

that when you interview and you decide you'd like to go to work for a company

you really really should pin them down about what you're going to be doing when you get there

because if you don't

you may not be doing that

and i thought i was going into an engineering job a little bit

um

undefined

but i ended up when i got there

uh

with a job that was a tech writer

writing

um

standard test methods for dupont elastomeric materials division

which were basically

uh

methods on how you stretch and pull and bounce

um

synthetic rubber

that's pretty far from computers

what

uh

what was the first step into computers

uh

my first step into computing was

uh

with a group at the same lab

i was at

which was a sales service lab

which helped

uh

dupont

customers apply dupont prod products to their products

uh

dupont basically made um raw materials for other people to use in developing a project or product

uh

for instance

uh

the elastomeric materials division made neoprene

and neoprene went into a lot of uh things like wet suits

and even went into tires for a long time

um

so there was another group there

which was a math

and sta group

and i'd interviewed with them and they were interested in me and after about a year here

they asked if i could

um be lent to that group for a for a

a short amount of time to develop

um

a

a model of a phone process for scott paper company

go

okay

so we were talking about

uh

a pham making process at dupont and some challenges in that

that led to a computing

so dupont was trying to help scott paper company with a new process that they had developed

uh

to make foam for gar

the garment industry

and

uh

the

the guy at the uh lab

dupont lab

that was in the

the

um manager of the math

and stat group wanted to build a model to help them schedule the production on this new machine

and so i

they asked if i could do that model

and i said

yeah

i do that because i was so bored to tear

trying to write these test methods that nobody seemed to like what i was writing

so they sent me off to uh school with ibm to to learn a language called gpss

3

gpss 3 was general general system simulator 3

general gpss

general purpose system simulator

general purpose system simulator 3

which was i their third

um

a

their third version of this

gpss is a language that's a a

um

an event driven block oriented language

where

uh

you have a number of of different uh blocks

or you could look at them as functions that perform a specific kind of thing like um

create

transaction was a block so you could create transactions into the

um

the system that you're trying to simulate these

all these all operated in parallel

too

right

it was a parallel event language

if i remember

right

yes

it is

i'm sorry

it is the language

uh

um

tried to simulate a

a realtime um process

a realtime um system and the

the

everything was running in parallel

but there was no

there was no

um need for synchronization

so you were kind of removed from the synchronization aspect of building this model

and i end up building a fairly large model and partway through the building of the model

i got really interested in in more about how the computer worked than how the the model worked

so i began to

uh

really dig in a lot about the computer architecture

the machine i was running on

the machine that we ran this model on was an ibm um

4044

70

yeah

it's a 44

4044

7440

maybe

anyway

it was a

it was the precursor to the 7094

well

79

so maybe it was a 7

it was a 7044

that's what it was

yeah

7044

7044

it was a 36 bit machine

and um

this

this is

uh

the time that i

i really learned how fallible humans are

and

and learned a lot of humility about programming and the fact that computers only do exactly what you say

and not what you mean

and i i went up to the ibm data center

we had to go up to philadelphia to go to the imm ibm data center

and with my deck of 2000 cards with all kinds of time free time

this time

um

scheduled with the ibm representative and my boss and everything

and we're jolly going up there

and we're going to run this model

and we get there

and we spend all the time trying to take the the syntax er out of the program

and we we never got them out the first day

# Chapter 2

and um

this

this is

uh

the time that i

i really learned how fallible humans are

and

and learned a lot of humility about programming and the fact that computers only do exactly what you say

and not what you mean

and i i went up to the ibm data center

we had to go up to philadelphia to go to the imm ibm data center

and with my deck of 2000 cards with all kinds of time free time

this time

um

scheduled with the ibm representative and my boss and everything

and we're jolly going up there

and we're going to run this model

and we get there

and we spend all the time trying to take the the syntax er out of the program

and we we never got them out the first day

so that was a really humiliating experience

so the so the gpss project finally worked

and you delivered some weit

the gps

the gps project or gpss project

uh

ran for i think about a year

and

uh

we had somebody from scott paper assigned to work with me that actually was a

was a somebody similar to me

very little experience and a young guy

and he and i would go up to the data center and run this model and we would

we would feed information into it and try to get results out

and we

what we're trying to do was we were trying to figure out how

or what the best um schedule was for scheduling a

a

a number of different colors

and textures of foam on this machine to get the best productivity out out of the machine and we

you know

eventually they

we

we got the model to work and we said

okay

you know

give us a question to ask the model and they came up with a question about scheduling

and we ran that and we had

you know

a big presentation

and

and

uh

we handed over the model to them and said okay

here's the model

you know

all you have to do is go to the ibm data center

run this

and you have a guy that can run this

and i really don't know what they did after that

i suspect they did very little with it

but it was sort of a

um

a lot of it was public relations on dupont

having a a vested interest in seeing

that scott paper company had the best support they could possibly get to run their phone process

so this initial 4a into computers then leads to digging deeper into how computers really work

and how operating systems really work

so after after this project

uh

i sort of

you know

got more interested in computing

and decided that i would really like to stay in the math and stat group

so i stayed in the math and stat group and and worked on various things

we had a 1108

well

it was 11 : 07 to start with univac machine at the at the experimental station

which was

i don't know

15

20 miles away and there was a shuttle that ran back and forth every day and we could submit

uh programs to run on that computer and get the results back

so i started doing some of that stuff for the math and stat group

and i also got involved with um with procuring a

a cdc 1700

which is a 16-bit machine to automate the

um

the instron

machines

which was a tensil

that's a tensil

strength testing machine

um

for the lab

and so i got pretty interested in that

um

and this all lasted

i would say maybe about two years

and then i started to think about

i really wanted to be somewhere where i was working more on computing computers

uh

rather than working on computers as a tool to solve other problems

so i succeeded in negotiating a transfer to the engineering department

a dupont

which had lots of computing capability and there they're the ones had the 1107

which they upgraded

the 1108 and uh

i joined the online systems group there

so the

the

uh

the 1108 uh and 1107 had a product called exec

2

which

uh

was kind of notoriously flaky

well

the okay

so the

on

what what did i do in the online systems group

um

basically i was trying to help um

the engineering service division

which was part with the online system group within was trying to help

uh

the operating departments

the operating plants within the elastomer department

um

actually with the engineering department was a whole company

so there was 13 operating departments

so they're trying to help them with their computer

uh

process control needs within the company

but there were

there was a lot of downtime

because we were project oriented and we're trying to go out and sell our services to somebody

so there was a lot of time when there wasn't much to do

so i sort of had got interested in the 1107 1108

and i went to the system programming group

and asked them if there was anything i could do for them and they said

well

yeah

i could probably help them figure out why

exec 2

which was the operating system

the 1108 was crashing so often

so they said what we want you to do is figure this out

and every time this the 1108 crashes

we take a dump and a dump is about

um

well

four four inches of fanfold paper

um

which is a

i think octal dump and um

we want you to figure out why or what's wrong with the system

so at times i would have a stack of these dumps that was 6 feet high in my office

and looking

you know

trying to figure out what the pattern was for this and

and i i found

um

several problems that were our fault

um

our fault being dupons

because we made

uh

i would say about 2, 000 lines of modifications to exec two

um

but i never really did really figure out what was really wrong

and i guess an interesting side story is that later on

when i was working at um

at microsoft in the early 80 or the late

i guess the early 90s

somebody from the university of washington in st louis did a study on the timing of the 1108

and and came to the conclusion that it would go metastable every four hours

because of the synchronizers in the system

didn't synchronize all the clocks properly

so i guess that was the real answer to why it was so flaky

so this is kind of immersion by fire into what an operating system is

uh

it is it

and i

you know

i spent a lot of time on the i'm

i

i should say

let me say

um

this was trial by fire

um

i was at the end of trying to figure out why something didn't work

which made me figure out why how it worked all right

so i had to figure out how it worked

to find out why it didn't work

and i'd be in these dumps and you know i'd trace back in the dump

you know

maybe a thousand instructions

and then the

the trail would just poof

it's gone like it's just gone

so eventually they

they got to the point

where they trusted me enough

that that i actually actually became one of the main people that maintained the system

and made improvements to it

what we thought were improvements

and put in um dupont specific changes to to streamline the operation of the 1108

so this

this is now

i know something about operating systems and i want to take my career further in that direction

um operating systems really interested me

and you know

i don't know why i decided that boy

that was the way i wanted to go

but it was really the way i wanted to go

and maybe i didn't know it exactly at that point

but but i sure

some of the most satisfying time i had was on the 11 : 08

um

and then i

i

the online system

part of it actually kicked in at one point or a couple points

where we did get some big things to do

we got a a big job to to work on at the u experimental station

which was dupont's main research center

which is a fairly big site

it was 120 acres and all 13 operating departments had um offices there

um

so they decided that they would like to automate the analysis of um

some of their instrumentation instrument data

and we proposed a dual pdp10 system to do that

we spent

i don't know

maybe six months with various other vendors

ibm being a vendor

uh

sds

if you remember

sds scientific data systems being a vendor

that we looked at the sigma 5 um and we decided the pdp10 was the best alternative

so we we built or we bought a pdp10 a dual pdp10 system with shared memory

uh

special

built by computer

special systems at dupon or not dupon

uh

digital and um

then we wrote one of the

we wrote an operating system for one of them

which was really the front end

um

and it brought in all the data

and then when the data was complete

it submitted it through the shared memory directly to the tops 10 system

which then did the analysis of programs written in fortran and then we shipped the the uh results back

so i got quite a bit of experience on uh deck

pp10s

um

became pretty knowledgeable about p

uh

the

the top stand went to digital

to a school on top stand

um

which was run by dave plumber

which was u digital's number one

uh guy about

uh

running courses on um

the tops 10

so after that

i came back

uh to the engineering department

and they gave me another job that was on deck equipment

which was a pdp11 uh

gauge control system for cronar film

which was used in magnetic tape

and this system was

uh

a pdp 1120

and at that time there was no suitable operating system for from digital

not digital

yeah

digital

no suitable operating system from digital

that would actually do this

we were going to do this on a very small pb11

i think it probably only had 8k of memory

um

so i was given the the task of developing the

the little runtime

the little real-time runtime system

to to to

uh

do the

the cronar gauge control system

um

so

when i finished that

i sort of decided that maybe it was time for me to to move on

and and think about something else

um

in fact

what i was thinking about was i'd move from from using computers to solve problems

to actually working on computers themselves

but with not within a computer company

and i thought

well

if i really want to max maximize my value to a company

and i want to be in the operating system business

i ought to go to a company that builds computers

so i arranged an interview with digital in um

mater massachusetts

and lo and behold

they hired me

so off the digital

i went

uh

just backtrack

a little bit here

what did you

what did you think of dupont in the year you were there for six years and an interesting culture

what was i

i was at dupont for seven years and

uh

the culture at dupont was very

um

kind of like really foreign to me

because it was very

it was an old company dupont was founded

i think in the mid 1800s

um

they

they supplied um

black powder during the civil war

um

that's how they got their start was black powder

um

a very bureaucratic

company

um

very regimented

um

you didn't tend to do things like go talk to your boss's boss

um

so it was

um

you know

i would

i had a good time at dupont and it was great for my career

but

um

i didn't feel as comfortable there as i actually ended up feeling it at deck

which was a very different kind of company

so did you

did you have a sense of what the deck culture was like

when you decided it was time to move to there

uh

when i went to deck

i had absolutely no idea what the culture was

other than the fact that i had went to the pdp10 programming course

so i was

um

a little bit acclimated to the

the

uh

the facilities that we're all

the digital

was in a mill and the mill was old

it led back to the mid 1800s also

uh

but not not really anything about the culture

i i

you know

and i i never really thought about that

um

i think i thought more about the opportunity than i did about

you know

was the culture going to be the same or different

you know

if the culture had been the same as it was at dupon

i still would have went because the col or the opportunity was better

so talk a little bit about the getting started at deck

you know who

who was your first boss and what was the direction of the

the task at hand

my first job

well

let's let's back up a little bit about what i was hired for at digital

this is a kind of like

maybe another instance of um

not knowing exactly what you'd end up doing

although i really had this one tied down and i was going to work on something called os 45

and os 45 was a dream of dave stones

who was the head of programming at at digital

and the 45 had some special solid state memory that you could buy

that was 300 nond memory

and this is in 1971

and the pdp10 was

at that time

i think the best pd

well

the pdp10 was a a a above microsc machine

so this was

this was a very fast machine

and dave stone had this vision that we were going to recreate tops 10 on the 45 and um

we were also going to incorporate realtime system pro or realtime capabilities

and batch capabilities in addition to the time sharing

and there was a group of people that was assembled

that was probably about eight people

and um

the leader and of the group

and my initial boss was um

peter van rokin

peter came from rca and he was responsible for the development of vmos vos

which was the virtual memory operating system that ran on the rca ibm compatible machines

# Chapter 3

that was 300 nond memory

and this is in 1971

and the pdp10 was

at that time

i think the best pd

well

the pdp10 was a a a above microsc machine

so this was

this was a very fast machine

and dave stone had this vision that we were going to recreate tops 10 on the 45 and um

we were also going to incorporate realtime system pro or realtime capabilities

and batch capabilities in addition to the time sharing

and there was a group of people that was assembled

that was probably about eight people

and um

the leader and of the group

and my initial boss was um

peter van rokin

peter came from rca and he was responsible for the development of vmos vos

which was the virtual memory operating system that ran on the rca ibm compatible machines

and so i came to digital and i spent probably the first two or three months

um

thinking about all this stuff

and the group was thinking about all this stuff

and then all of a sudden

um

we weren't really making a lot of progress on this

because there was one little small problem

that dave stone hadn't really considered as much as he really should have

and that was that the address space the pdp1 was 65k bytes and 65k

bytes

uh

just wasn't going to cut it for an address space

and the memory management capabilities weren't that great either

uh

so we had an awful hard time really getting started

and getting up to speed on what we were going to really do with this os

45

so there was another project

that was going on over in the industrial products group develop a a uh process control system for uh

or process control os for the pdp11

it was called rsx1 c

and they had been working on that for a couple years

and it was going nowhere and they asked me if i would go work on that

and i said

well

yeah

sure

i guess i will go work on that

um

you know

we're not doing much on this other project

so the first project i worked on really as far as real work was the rsx1 c system

and the the rsx1 series

uh

ended up cdm or something like that

if our my recollection is correct

rx11 c was the kind of like the first in the series of the rsx systems

which were primarily sponsored by the industrial products group but were also

uh

sponsored by the laboratory data products group

also because they were in the real-time business and um

rs 61c

was

uh

really

um

kind of like

was a just a coreon

uh

system that supported a few peripherals

um addd converters

um

um terminal interfaces

um

that was about it

and so there was a real need for some more functional systems

and

and as we filled out the pdp11 line

um

course

the 45 was a pretty big machine

but we filled it out with a lot of other ones to the

the 1140 and 45

well

yeah

the 45

the 1170

um

there was um

a need for some more machines or more operating system capability

that supported a more rich programming and and capability

and so there were several rsx systems

there was rsx1 c

there was rsx1 b

which maybe that that one may have never

um

had any body really know much about it

but it was basically rs rsx1 c that could load doss 11 files off of the dis

so it was sort of like we can store programs on the dis and run them

but it's still a coreon system

and then rsx1 m and rsx1 d

um

the order in which we did these was rsx1 c was done first and then b

and when i did b

i said i will do b

but i want you to te

promise me that i don't have to work on this again

and they said okay

so at about that same time

rsx 11d was starting up

which was a an equivalent of rsx uh 15

which is the 18-bit real-time system that digital sold

and so i was um assigned to work on that

and there was a fellow named hank cree

which was the main designer of that

because he worked on the r615 and i agreed to do

uh

the overlay linker for it

so my involvement when rs r 611d was the overlay linker and when we finished that

um

that came out a little bit larger than we hoped

and a little bit slower

than we'hoped so i had had had this idea of about building a system with a really different architecture

the r 611d had an architecture where basically everything ran as a process

and doing that meant the drivers ran as processes

which meant that there was an ipc

an interprocess communication mechanism had to exist between the program that wanted the service of a driver

and the driver

which wasn't really

uh

conducive to the real-time performance we wanted to have

so i had this other idea of building a system that was a lot different

in fact

it's mostly like

um

the other systems that we built

or i've been involved with

um

so i i proposed building r611 m

and the industrial products group got pretty excited about it

and they gave me i guess about eight people to work on that

and we completed that in about a year and a half or two years

and that became the main real-time system for pdp 11s because it would run on all the pdp 11s

the ones that had memory management system

uh

memory management units

and the ones that didn't in fact it ran on

it ran on systems from 32k bytes up to two megabytes

um

a big span

so this is the first time that you're running a major software project

right

a major operating system development project

um

was this the first time that i was running a major project

um

probably you would consider that to be the first time of a major project

because this was something that we're actually going to sell

we're going to sell rsx 11m

we're going to have customers

we're going to have support issues

and so there's all of that and we're

we're going to have documentation to do

um

the pdp10 system was probably

um

not quite as big a project

but but i was the lead guy there

too

very inexperienced

um

i don't know how dupon ever had the faith they had in me to do that

but um

they did did

and i'm thankful they did

so

rs 611m was really the first

the first time that i did a project

um

and so i developed around r611 a lot of things about

you know i was

how are we going to do this

and

uh

what

are we going to do

and what do we have to do

and so you know

one of the first things i wanted to know is what is the scope of work

what are we going to do

uh

you can't just just say we're going to do an operating system

we ought to know

well

what capabilities it's going to have

what are its constraints

one of the constraints it had was it had to be subset compatible with r 611d

so it wasn't a blank sheet of paper where we could just go off and do a new system

it was

well

it has to be subset compatible

but it's it's source

level compatible

not binary compatible

so that was a big

um

a big caveat

because binary compatibility is much more hard or much harder to achieve

so

r 611m was really my first

um

real operating system

um

from scratch

i think it took about two years

um

it was delivered with

um

what i think was pretty good quality for the tools and everything we had at that time

um

my philosophy about quality was quality was number one

it's still my first thing is quality

number one

so the

the size is the gold rubber stamp

uh

played into that

or

um

the

the one of the big constraints with r611 m was

or one of the big problems with r611 d was it required so much memory

so with r611 m

we wanted to build a much smaller system

and

and i kind of figured out right off the bat

that the only way to do that was we give everybody a budget

so everybody had a budget about how much memory they could use

and you know

if somebody

so that was their target

so if somebody came back and said i can't possibly do that

and you know whatever the budget was

then we'd rethink that

but um

generally everybody meant their budget

and so to kind of reinforce that

every i had this rubber stamp made

that says size is the goal

and everything was stamped with size is the goal

in those days there was no email

so there was no electronic exchange of communication

so all communication was through memos

and every memo was stamped with size is the goal

size is the goal

so we ended up with

you know

in a 32k byte system

there was 16k bytes for the operating system

and 16k bytes for whatever the the user environment was or the application environment

there wasn't really user mode and there was user mode and kernel mode

but these were dedicated systems

you know it wasn't

it wasn't a system where

um

there were a lot of people going to use this in a general way it was like this system is dedicated to controlling something in a real-time way

and and whoever bought the system would write the software that would control their process

now this is

uh

where the first dave cutler kernel

the dck shows up

you go off and code a big part of the operating system yourself

uh

well

all the stuff that i worked on

i did a lot of it myself

i

i did

um

going back to pdb1 i did a lot of that myself

in fact

everything that i've done throughout my career

um

i've always been a very hands-on person

um

i can't just stand back and say

you know

this is what we're going to build

you guys go off and write the specs

um

and i'm going to manage you

i sort of become part of the team

and i look at myself as more a leader than a manager

and i want to lead the people to build the product

and that means i'm a part of that

and and

um

there's no job that i can't that i won't do

um

i like to have

i have this little saying

that the successful people of the world are the people that do the things that the unsuccessful ones won't

so i've always been this person that you know i i will build the system

i will fix the bugs

i will fix other people's bugs

i will fix bug

uh

bill breaks

it's all in part of of um of getting the job done

so

so

uh

the 11s running out of gas deck decides it's time to build a 32-bit computer

they're behind sds and seal and others in 32 bits

and a new operating system is needed and vms starts off

uh

about

um

i think it was 1975

digital

um realized that they needed to build a 32-bit computer

and so being a part of rs 61m and the 11 world

i

i kind of got um i got involved in that

we had several architecture groups

several levels of architecture group

there was

we decided to call this vax

and vax was a code name

which stood for virtual address extension

because the pdp11 had such a small virtual address space

um

and gordon bell was the the person that was behind this

it was his vision that we should build this computer

and vax a was the hardware architecture group and vax b was sort of a review group

and then i think there was another one called vxi

which was kind of like the rest of the company

and i was like a formal member of vax b

but an informal member of vax a

also

so i spent a lot of time on the vax

a

uh

group

um

discussing the computer and whatever

and we

bill strucker was involved in this in gordon bell

this is my first real involvement

gordon

um

he was definitely at the company all the time i was there

but this is the first time i was really involved with him and we would meet

um

almost every day and talk about this computer and the instruction set and what we should do

and one of the biggest goals of of vax was to be able to encode a program in the same amount of memory

that the pdb1 could encode it

so that sort of dictated it a a instruction set that was pretty dense

um

the other thing is

we definitely wanted to

uh

increase the virtual address space by quite a bit

and building a 32-bit computer would allow us to do that

and at that time

like going from 16 to 32 was like man

how could we ever run out of 32 bits of address space and we'll later on

we'll skip forward and we'll figure out why we did run out of 32 bits

uh

so the vax

um

the vax a and the architecture group

um

basically were

were

uh

defining the architecture

and there were

there were other software people involved

uh

there were some people from the pdp10 group that were involved

uh

mainly peter conlan

and we hired a fellow from um zerox

who had worked at sds

who had worked on a system called cp5

which was

uh

um

one of the systems that ran on the sigma 5

it was the operating system of the sigma 5

his name was dick husett

this is dick

uh

was involved with vx a and the other person was involved with peter litman

you know there were some other people

but we basically developed the architecture and then the company said well

let's build it

and and so we sort of said

well

how long do you want this to be

and they said

well

two years seem reasonable

he said

oh my lord

we can never build this in two years

this is too complicated of an architecture to build in two years

so we had

uh

this off-site one week

uh

come to jesus meeting about what we would do to the architecture to make this system buildable in two years

and that i think that was called the blue ribbon committee

and there was three software people and three software implementers and three hardware implementers plus some of the architects

and we hammered out the the final vax architecture

uh

which reduced the um

the complexity of the

# Chapter 4

well

how long do you want this to be

and they said

well

two years seem reasonable

he said

oh my lord

we can never build this in two years

this is too complicated of an architecture to build in two years

so we had

uh

this off-site one week

uh

come to jesus meeting about what we would do to the architecture to make this system buildable in two years

and that i think that was called the blue ribbon committee

and there was three software people and three software implementers and three hardware implementers plus some of the architects

and we hammered out the the final vax architecture

uh

which reduced the um

the complexity of the

the

the instruction set architecture quite a bit

i i suspect that people would still say that the instruction said architecture was overly complicated

but it was really complicated before that

and

and the other thing

that happened was the memory management was so complicated

that the only person that could actually explain it was richie larry

and everybody else was sort of like

yeah

that seems like it might work

but we're not really sure

and so we really simplified the memory management architecture so

that the hardware architects thought that they could build it efficiently

and the software people thought that we could build an operating system for it

and one of the the decisions we made with vax

in fact

we made two

a couple of decisions with va

that

that limited the life of vax one was the the encoding of the um instruction stream to be be equivalent to the pb1

which caused it a extremely difficult to um implement hardware system that was mainly in hardware

and not mainly in micro code

so the vaac instruction set mostly was executed in micr code and not in hardware

because it was so hard to to decode

and the other thing that was u kind of a mistake

a long-term mistake was the page size being 512 bytes versus something more reason able

like 1k bytes or 4k bytes

would have been a much better um solution

however

you know

we looked at it and the marketing people wanted wanted

they wanted to sell vac systems that were the size of pdp11 systems in memory

so they wanted to sell a system that was 128k bytes

well

the most complicated uh instruction in the vax architecture was adpack

six

that was an ad packed instruction decimal instruction with six operands that could touch 40 pages

so it became

if it has to touch 40 pages and you only have 128k bytes

then you don't want to get into a live loock situation

where the what's going on in the system is such

that you can never get all the pages in to to actually execute instruction

so we settled on the 512 byte instruction set

um

so after the architecture was kind of signed off on and we decided we really want to build it

we went through the blue ribbon committee

uh

published the final architectural spec

then we put together the software group

and we put together the hardware group to build the hardware and to build the software

and

um

i was the technical lead of the software group

um

and then we spent

we went off and spent

um

i would say six months

uh

trying to think about and understand and um

how to build the system

because we were

we were death afraid of building a paging system

there wasn't a lot of experience on paging systems in those days

the pdp10 did not have paging

it had swapping

um

bbnn

had built a modification to the pdp10 which had paging

but you know the sort of the the

the scuttle butt was

it didn't run real well

multic was a paging system and multic did not run well

i'm not sure that multics would run well on today's hardware

uh

it was a great system

it

it

it spawned a lot of creative ideas

but it was basically very slow

anybody that ran on that system

definitely was not concerned about productivity

so we spent a long time figuring out how we would build this system

so we thought we would have good performance

um

we would be able to build it in a couple years and um

we would have the quality that we wanted to have

and so after six months we we

we

um

authored a document called the i think the starlet um design and project plan

well

a scarlet project plan and from that we started out and we implemented

um

we implement

we built

we implemented

or well

see

we developed vms mainly on r 611m and um rsx1 m had a little bit

by that time it had a little bit of time sharing capability

so there was multi-use and we had a large um 1170

probably two two megabytes of memory on it

um

two megabytes

um

so we developed mainly on on r611 m

but then we ran it on a simulator

the the uh group that actually built the vax 11

uh

750 was the group that was assigned to build the

the emulator for the for vx

and we actually had an emulator run on

which was a hardware emulator

so we had

we didn't run on a simulator

we ran on emulator and um

uh

we developed it

i got it running there

and then the

when the hardware

the breadboard for the 1170 uh was available

we took the what we had and we went up stairs and um

it pretty

much ran it

uh

booted up and

uh

at least we got to the point where i didn't crash

so

um

that's kind of how how we started

and then

from then on we they built a prototype

um

i think it was proto 4

and that was our develop machine

and everybody ran on the develop machine and we ran what we built

and that was the

this is the first instance of the dog food thing

mhm

where you run on what you're developing

and that gives you a big incentive to fix whatever's wrong

so we would

um

we're all sitting

and this was vms

is a time sharing system

so

we were all in our offices all close to the machine

and if it crashed

you know dick husett

and peter litman

and i would go out

and look to see why it crashed and we'd figure out why it crashed and we reboot

go back to our office and fix the problem and then go out and reboot a new system

and then everybody would be with a new system

so that's sort of how the development of vms occurred and the day we shipped vms

uh

we had zero known bugs

now it was zero known bugs

that didn't mean there was no bugs

but there were zero known bugs

and i know there was a bug right at the very end

where we had a race condition that was fixed

like in the 11th hour

um

in then

the

the final binaries were submitted to

uh

the manufacturing plant

so the vms and the 780 kind of launched deck into the super mini

bigger applications

more nudging into the commercial world

all kinds of new features and requirements coming

and that spawns a lot of evolution of vms

so you

you were with the vms team

well

all of that

no

i

when vms vms was

um

what i was my first very difficult project

where you know

there were some constraints placed on us that were very

um

very hard

we were the two years that we were given to eventually or effectively produce a system of the level

and caliber of ems was very short

um

and at that point i thought that at the i thought you know

maybe i should try some other things i'm interested in

and one of the other

one of the things i was very interested in was compilers

so

at the end of vms version one

i decided that i would um start a compiler group to produce a pl1 compiler

so i really didn't

uh

continue on with the

with the the uh

continuing versions of the ms

i

i

uh

split off at that point and started this group of consisting of i think four people

and i think we grew to about six people to do a pl1 compiler

and we

we bought a u a front end for the compiler from a company in um boston

and we produced the back end

which was the code generator

and i think that was another two-year project or so

so

and in part of that project also spawned a c compiler for vax also

and this was an example of really eating the dog food of writing the compiler in the compiler in pl1 actually pl1

um

as far as a dog food kind of thing

um

was an interesting way

we did the compiler

um

we had the front end of the compiler on that was delivered to us on multics and multic

the first we first thought that what we would do is we would

we would take the the multic compiler

and we would compile the pieces of the multic compiler

and we'd bring them over to vax and run them

eventually

we tried running the the remotely on the multic system

and we we couldn't get it to run in full duplex mode

and this is like got in 100

whatever is 50 miles to boston

it's 300 b

so we tried half duplex

it was a little bit at half duplex

so we just that wouldn't work either

so we decided what we would do is we'd hire a shuttle service

and

and the guy that was working on the front end would produce stuff on multics

put it on mag tape

give it to the shuttle service

bring it to deck and we take it off the mag tape

so the first thing we did was

um

we did

we

we bootstrapped the compiler backwards

so we were doing the code generator on our end

but our

the code generator was mostly written in assembler

um

so we got that working

and then we would bring back the phases of the compiler one by one backwards

until we got back to the beginning of the compiler

and then we could compile the whole thing at digital

so we really were eating our dog fu

because the whole compiler was written in pl1 except for the

the

the parts of the code generator that had to run line last

so you

now we're about 1981 at deck or so

or a little earlier

this is about

this is about

um

well

it's yeah

19881

um

sometime during that year

maybe early in that year

so some circumstances conspire and dave says

is no longer for me

pardon

maynard was no longer for you

so what happened after the pl1 compiler was

um

um

you know

i sort of getting really a little bit fed up with the the growth of digital

when i started digital

there was 12, 000 people

and i don't know

in 8 881

there certainly wasn't 12, 000 anymore

there was 75 75, 000 or something

and so what started out to be this really engineering run engineering

um environment

um

suddenly became more of a management

marketing program

management environment

which i wasn't too happy with

and so i had expressed some things to gordon about um

maybe that i would like you know to be somewhere else

and he had offered to

uh

he said

well

anywhere you want to go

you know

maybe we can figure out how we can start engineering

uh

facility there

and i'said well

i don't know

maybe maybe i'll be okay here

and then this opportunity came up to start a company that was um going to um

commercialize a compiler

i'm sorry

a language that was

uh

funded by the government for real-time control

which is called praxis

and it was done for lawrence livermore

and it was actually done for the shiva noa project

which was a fusion energy project

um

so i kind of got enthused about doing that and we we being

uh

i guess about six people

three of us from deck

and a couple from or four of us from deck and a couple from lawrence livermore

you know

traveled around the

the

the

the bay area looking for money

and

uh

we sort of got to the point

where i think we figured out that maybe this wasn't the right thing to do

or at least i figured out this wasn't the right thing to do

and so i had

i

we

i told digital

i'm leaving

and so

um

you know

gez

we had a termination date and everything

and and then all of a sudden i think

oh

well

i'm not sure this is going to work out

you know

um

the president of the company was going to be a guy from the shiven noa project

and he seemed to be more interested in how he was going to spend all of our seed money

which we had put up ourselves on things like his color and his wife

uh

paying his wife for our stationary

so suddenly all our money that we'put together was gone

and i'm thinking

wow

i don't know if i want to go with this guy

so at the last moment i said

no

i'm not going to do it so effectively

all the other deck guys says

well

we're not doing it either

so then became the question about

well

gez

what are you going to do

and so i said

well

you know

i think i think it's really appropriate that i think about being somewhere else where i'm kind of isolated

a little bit from a little smaller environment

where we don't have all of the bureaucracy or we're developing a deck

so gordon says

well

geez that's sounds good to me

let's where would you like to go

and i said

well

can't be on the east coast

because that won't be far enough

you know

i really don't really like the southwest too much

so maybe you know

like arizona in new mexico

probably texas is not a good place

probably the west coast would be the best place

well

gordon says you know the west coast would be fine

but i want you to be somewhere where there's a a university that's got a good computer science program

# Chapter 5

i think i think it's really appropriate that i think about being somewhere else where i'm kind of isolated

a little bit from a little smaller environment

where we don't have all of the bureaucracy or we're developing a deck

so gordon says

well

geez that's sounds good to me

let's where would you like to go

and i said

well

can't be on the east coast

because that won't be far enough

you know

i really don't really like the southwest too much

so maybe you know

like arizona in new mexico

probably texas is not a good place

probably the west coast would be the best place

well

gordon says you know the west coast would be fine

but i want you to be somewhere where there's a a university that's got a good computer science program

uh

so that we can draw people from there

and maybe we can

we can actually collaborate with the

with the

the university

so the deck

um

real estate department arranged this trip

where we would fly to several different places on the west coast and look at

and we

we went to um

went to san francisco

we went to um sacramento

um

they were really hot on santa rosa

we went to portland and we came to seattle and i had spent a little time in portland

a little earlier

in fact

what had spawned the earlier

the earlier um offer by gordon to um

to um

establish a engineering facility for me

was that i had actually interview interviewed at intel in portland

and which is kind of an interesting

this is kind of a backtrack

but let me go back and talk about that

just for a second

this happened

and and i interviewed and they were building

uh

the 432 at that time

which was their 32-bit computer

um

which eventually never ever materialized

but

um

we had lost a couple people

dave best

who had been the program manager for the 750 went there

so i interviewed out there

and they got to the point of they were going to offer me a a job and they said

well

we can't really offer you a job because we're

we really cooperate a lot with digital

and you've got to tell gordon bell that you're going to

you're interested in this

so i said

no problem

so we're at spit book road

i call up gordon

i said gordon

i just i've been interviewing with intel and i don't really want their job

but i

you know

i want their offer because i want to figure out how much i'm worth

i said

okay

you

okay with that

he saysure

and i hung up and about 15 minutes later the phone rings and it's larry partners

admin said larry and gordon would like to come up to spit brook and have lunch with you

i said

oh

that's fine

when

today

will that be okay

and i said

sure

so they

they came to to spit brook and said we went to lunch and they basically said

well

why

why do you want to leave

and i said

well

i i don't want to leave

i just want to know what my value is in the market

they said

oh

well

maybe we can work something out

and then that's when gordon said

i said i really like portland

and gordon said

well

maybe we

we can think about this

and so you know

we did something about the the salary thing

and we did something about stock options and we thought about that a little bit

then i said

hey

i don't really want to do that

i

i

i'm

i'll stay here for a while and then this other company opportunity came up and then

when that fell through

it was really like

i really do want to move

so anyway

we're back to the west coast

we're going down the west coast and we go everywhere and we come to seattle and it's raining

but everything's green

and i said

gee boy

this is really a nice place and we visited the university

we we talked to

uh

the head of the computer

the chairman of the computer science department

i forget what his name was

um

he was really interested in his coming

and so we went back home and we thought about it for a while and and said you know

seattle's got to be the place that's got to be the place

so that's how we ended up in seattle

um

sort of we took the trip and looked at some different places

and

uh

decided we didn't really like sacramento very well

um

the barrier was a little bit too busy for us

um

and belleview was a pretty nice place to be

so that's where we ended up

so here you are

so a number of people decided to come with you

and then some other folks were hired here locally

you started up a lab

uh

it

we

we came here and

uh

we brought

um

i guess about eight people with us and we hired

you know

one of the things was

we would like to hire some people from the university of washington to to fir

uh

to firm up that that um connection of university of washington

we hired a couple people

um

from there

and

uh

started on a project to our our charter

by the way for this was to produce um again

going back to the real-time roots to produce some uh software for embedded

uh

chip-based back systems we were working on a chip set at that time called scorpio

uh

which by today standards would have been huge because it was six chips

um

i think three of them were custom custom vsi chips

so it was a you

it was a big

would been big compared to today

but it was very small compared to what we had in those days

so our charter was to build um

this runtime system

our little real-time operating system

which was very easy to program

and

uh

which was very easy to um

implement real-time applications

and the name of the system was back salon and

um

it was our

it was my first entry or our first entry

into multi-threading we actually did multi-threading in back salon

which is about the same time that mach was doing multi-threading on um

at carnegie melon

just about the same time

so we got partway through this project and we start thinking about

well

scorpio has been going for quite a few years

now

we don't know when it's going to be delivered

um

we don't really have any suitable platform to run this on

uh

maybe we should think about

uh

what we should do to to vax to maybe make vax a smaller architecture

so we started an effort

uh

within the company called microvax

and which was to trim down the architecture

and then

later on

after we had developed the architecture

we thought

well

we still don't have any platform to run this on

because we're going to have to produce a chip for this

and there was a micras chip

so maybe we should start a hardware group here too and we should produce a uh

an implementation of microa

that would not be one chip

but it would be a small system

maybe the size of a pp105

so we brought some more people out from deck east

um for the hardware project and

and they were mainly people from the east

but we also hired

we hired

uh

i

guess three people locally

um

because there was a lot of

there's a lot of going on in this area

um

with electronics

so it was easy to hire a few people and to produce a m theu microa r

we actually shipped

uh

velon and microa one together

and i got very interested in hardware at that time and i ended up working on vac salon

pretty much writing the kernel and the other people wrote the pieces

the file system and the pieces that went around it

but then i switched to the hardware group for the microx one and wrote all the micro code

and somewhere along the way

you hooked up with carver

me and took the team to learn

learn how to do that

the way that we

uh

implemented the microx one

uh system was

um

gordon thought it would be a good idea if we tried

uh

some new technology with respect to producing silicon chips and one of the new technologies that was being touted

by carver me from

uh

was he from caltech tech

um

and linn conway

was

um

some um

silicon piler tools

and there

the company that was founded actually called silicon compilers

that kid was a principal in and john hennessy was also

and we got together with them

and inspected a chip that they could build that would be the central processing unit of the system

and it would be on one chip

and so that's

they produced the chip

um

they designed the chip

uh

jointly with our specifications going back and forth

they didn't have the all the expert expertise

and then our hardware

guys designed all the hardware that went around that

uh

we had a an awful time getting the the chip built

we

we went to a company called ami to start with

which you know

in those days

um semiconductor companies were popping up like um dandel lines

there were lots of them

um

they'd pop up

they'd run through their vc funding

they'd lie over

roll over and play dead

ami never actually produced a chip for us that worked

they produced a chip and we got the chip

when we looked at it and they had done all the masks backwards

they were all the negative of what they should be

oops

oops

so i don't know how that happened

so we went to another company called seik and seek actually produced the chip

um

i can't remember us

um

having any problems with the chip with respect to arata

um

you know

there may have been some things that we worked

i

i don't really

i don't really remember

i remember it being pretty much bug free

and we were um able to take that chip and we put it in a cubus based system

and that was microx one and we ran velan on it

but later on we also ran vi a mess on it

um

partway through the microvax um architecture discussion

we had trimmed the memory management capabilities of um vms

quite a bit

i'm not vms

the the ar

the memory management capabilities of v

way down

which meant that vms would not run with it

it would have to be big modification to vms to make it run

and so i was writing the micro code and i was thinking

geez

why don't we just do the full memory management

not much micro code

so i got bob sutnik to agree to that

he was the guy that was doing the micro code for the microx one chip

that we just do the whole thing

it was going to be less work to do that than not do it

and we get the ms to run

so we got vms to run almost at the same time

we got our our system to run

and um

i

i don't remember exactly the year

it was probably 86 or something

84

maybe 84

about 3 years

maybe three years in development for that system

um

so

uh

that was our first project at at deck west

and where did that lead to

well

that led

what

what did that lead to that led to problems that led to big problems

because here we are

we have

now we have this kind of seasoned operating system group

we have the seasoned hardware group

now

what are we going to do

and so the problem is to try to find something to do that's not being done

by another group at headquarters

and so we went through several proposals on building projects

uh

building systems

um

um

hardware was mainly hardware

uh

there were some people at deck west

uh

that wanted to build um

a workstation

um

and then there were some people that that wanted to build a more capable system than the workstation

and

uh

we ended up not building the workstation and we ended up trying to build a bigger system

and

um

that led to big problems

because we were always over the top

we're always duplicating some function

that or some

uh

part of the the uh price performance space that somebody at at headquarters was already doing

so we went through several projects

um

trying to

uh

find the right vac to build

and we basically we would go

i would go back to mayard and try to negotiate

um

what we should build

and get some degree of buying

and come back and we work for six months and then mayard would decide

well

that wasn't what they want us to build

so we have to find something else to build

so this sort of led to us

um

thinking about risk was becoming very popular at that time

and it was kind of u getting to the point

where there's a lot of publicity about risk having better performance in vaac

and risk was the way to go

and so we got interested in risk and

um

there were several risk projects going on in the company

there was one going on in marlboro

uh

there was one going on down in the bay area at wrl

which was a western research lab and we were sort of working on one

so

um

jack smith

who was the uh

senior vice president of engineering

said

deck west

is respons responsible for the risk architecture

so there started the prism project

which was

um

a new risk architecture for deck

and i think we probably started that in about um

85

i think maybe 85

so

um

that's what happened after we

we were

we

very successful in being

i

me

just tremendously successful

you know

very low overhead

very few people

um

we got things done in just record speed record for record amount of money

engineering

nre costs were like zilo compared to the other projects

but then into a period of not being able to find the right thing to do

and then into the architecture

the new architecture

all right

so

um

i guess it was kind of a a risk war

that started to evolve that de between various parts of the company

well

the reason that the prism archit ecture actually got assigned to deck west

was

because there were so many uh projects going on in the company trying to develop risk projects

or risk architectures

and of course digital already had

we know

we had the 36-bit line

# Chapter 6

um

we got things done in just record speed record for record amount of money

engineering

nre costs were like zilo compared to the other projects

but then into a period of not being able to find the right thing to do

and then into the architecture

the new architecture

all right

so

um

i guess it was kind of a a risk war

that started to evolve that de between various parts of the company

well

the reason that the prism archit ecture actually got assigned to deck west

was

because there were so many uh projects going on in the company trying to develop risk projects

or risk architectures

and of course digital already had

we know

we had the 36-bit line

which is a pdp 10 and then the dex system 20

we had the vax line

we had the pdp1 line

um

i don't think we were probably making any nines and 15s

we may may have still been shipping a few eights by by then

but um so we really didn't need three or four new risk architectures

so the prism architecture started out much like the vax architecture

with representatives from um

vms

had a representative hudson

which was

the semiconductor branch

had a a representative

uh

marlboro had a representative

one of the guys that worked on that architecture was there

we had um um myself

and then we had a guy from the architecture group

and we then spent the next three years

um

just about three years

uh

going through a revision of this

and then taking it back to the senior technical community and they would look at it and say

oh

we don't like this and we would go back we went

we flipped from 64 to 32 to 64

back to 32 in the architecture

which it took a long time to sort through all that

and then

and then you know

the whole principle of risk was to produce a hard or a

a system architecture that was easy to implement

um

you didn't have to have

uh

brute brute force methods of doing things and massive

uh

verification suites

um

and but then the the company kind of ran off the track and started adding all these things

the first thing that happened is we got to have vector arithmetic

so you have to

we have to compete with sear c

so we had to have a vector architecture

well

sear probably had

you know

he probably had eight vector instructions

well

we had to have 150 vector instructions

you know

so

and they had to be long vectors

they weren't short vectors

and so this went on and on and on

and you know

at the meantime

at deck west

we're sort of um gearing up

you think that we'd be in a holding pattern

but we're not

we're sort of gearing up for building one of these systems

and we have proposals for building these systems

and we took microx one and we actually converted it to be to run prism code

so people could actually develop software

and

um

we came to a point where

finally the company just said we're canceling prison and i went through

uh

several

we went through a lot of iterations

i'd go to

i'd go to maynard

try to try to get some consensus on what we should be doing

i'd come back home and invariably it was always something bigger

and we add we'd add people

so we kind of grew from you

like 20 people to 180 people

so we have this 180 people organization

and we're building kind of a nebulous project or nebulous product built based on this new architecture

at a time when the company was trying to build three of these machines

there was one in marlboro and one in um littleton and one seattle

so our machine got cancelled and our system got

can

our operating system which called micah got cancelled and i sort of got

i

i kind of went through the the stages of

um

you know

trying to find some ground where we could all agree on what we're going to build

come back

i'd sell the people on it and then they get disappointed

so i said i don't want to do this again

so i said what am i going to do

and i said

well

i guess i'll form a company

so i got three other guys and i together these are the same three guys we met with

i was talking earlier about bomber

which we'll get into later and we decided we were going to build

or we were going to form a company to build servers and

um

i formally quit

although i didn't leave right away

they gave me an office somewhere else until i had really subtle things

i spent a lot of time traveling back and forth to the the valley

uh

talking to the vc and what we're doing and whatever

and we actually got to the point where

um

we had the vc all lined up

we we had

um

we had 3 vc and myips

they were all going to put up some seed money

we're going to have a million dollars worth of seed money

which um was probably quite a bit of money in today's dollars

and this was

this would have been in 1988

so

um

somewhere during this period

quite a few of the people

when prison was canceled had decided that maybe they'd look across the street at microsoft and go to microsoft

and one of the people went over there

had

um been talking to

uh

bill bill gates about

uh

the group at micro

or group at deck west and that we had a good operating system group

and maybe that would be something that that he might be interested in

so

um

there was an interview arranged

and i went over

and talked to bill about what they were interested in doing and what they wanted to do

and and um

see if i was interested

and and they

their

uh

basic concern was that intel was not bringing the the x86 architecture forward fast enough

and that risk processors were going to overtake them

and if risk processors overtake them

then all the pc software that they developed would be wouldn't be valuable anymore

and that they ought to have something going on in risk

and if they were going to have something going on in risk

then they needed a new operating system that wasn't written in assembler

that was written in a portable language so that they could run across several different architectures

and so i sort of listened to all of this

and and um was really interested in doing my own company

and so i kind of left the interview thinking well

i don't think i'm real real interested in this

and sort of you know

time

kind of

i don't know

over a couple months

we mold us all over the four of us

and

and

um

finally we got all the dc lined up and

um

we got

we got the commitment from for the money

and before we were

we got the commitment

um

boy

you listen to them talk

we were the greatest people in the world but as soon as we got the commitment

our

our value seemed to diminish a little bit and they were a little bit more vocal about

um

whether or not we could actually run a company or not

whether we'd be able to to develop a product

even though we had a good history of product development

so i think sort of got under my skin a little bit

and about the same time

steve bomber

who

uh

worked at microsoft and he

uh

was the head of the finance department of microsoft called and said

uh

you know

how are

what are you thinking

and i said

well

i'm thinking that we're

you know

we're really close to doing this company and and we're probably going to turn down the

or

i'm probably going to turn down the microsoft offer

and he said

oh geez

uh

won't you give me a chance to to convince you otherwise

and i said

well

yeah

okay

he said

well

how about how about breakfast at denny's

you know

on saturday morning

at 7 o'clock or i don't

maybe it was a sunday morning

i mean

but it was early and i said

yeah

okay

so the four of us went to denny's and and sat down

and and steve is

is such an energetic guy and and um

a positive thinker and

so he starts the sales job

and

um

i guess

the best way thing you can say is he fleeced this

because

by the time we left

we're all ready to sign up and we did

we

we decided not to form our company

which i think was a great looking back on it

uh

we would have been just another server company

probably

unless

unless we could have

uh

developed some

in fact

we were

we were

really

um

founding was a hardware company

and unless we would have had the foresight to convert that company quickly to a software company

we would have been in trouble

so

um

in fact we were an interesting thing you might find interesting here is we actually were going to run unix on on this box

because of the lead time that would take to actually produce something of your own

and the fact that it would be incompatible with everything

so obviously we couldn't produce something that's vx compatible

so the next best thing was unix

and we decided that mach was the best example le of unic systems

they're actually going to use mock on this server

but anyway bomber fleeces us and we all decide to sign up and go to work for microsoft

and so you know

i quit immediately

they're still working for for deak

and you know

i

like

i quit on friday and join microsoft on monday

and the following monday

these other three guys follow me and then from there

um

we

we

i

i want to say we recruited because we didn't really recruit people

but people ask us about opportunities

and of course we're forthcoming about opportunities

so we managed to bring over quite a few people

we

and part of the thing about going to microsoft was they wanted the portable operating system

but i liked the hardware part of it too

having that

so

uh

we convinced them

or i convinced them that that i should have a hardware group

and the software group and that we would produce the hardware

produce

hardware group would actually produce the first risk-based pc

that the software group would be producing the operating system for

so we were able to bring over

i'm sorry we weren't able to bring over

we were able to to

uh

satisfy the

i think the statute of limitations is long past the statute of limit

long past

we were able to bring over these people from from deck

that had been

you know

the top performers at at deck west

and and so we got the the top hardware guys

and we got the top software guys

and you know it was about 10 10 or something like that

and we we hired some more people

we hired

um

we had part of the thing about

uh

the the group was

we the hardware group

not not like the software group

the software group

um

microsoft wanted to make sure we had microsoft people in the software group

because otherwise we would just produce some something that was duck the duck cultural thing

right

so we had

um

actually

i think we have one one software guy and he was a pretty good

pretty good

um

or

um

he was a vocal microsoft guy and he had a lot of ideas

um

which actually dovetailed with ours

pretty well

um

about how to build an operating system

they

microsoft had been working with ibm on os2 for several years

by that time and that relationship was not going real well

and this guy had worked on that so he was very happy to join our group

so you parachute kind of into microsoft and after a short period of time

you look around

what did

what did you see

what did microsoft look like at that time

well

microsoft didn't look like deck

um

actually

i should say

um

microsoft was a very different company than deck deck was

um

the thing i liked about deck

and i think that i can honestly say that that i spent most of my best

the most enjoyable engineering years at deck between 1971 and in 1980

or maybe 82 or 83

was

deck was mainly an engineering company

it was run mainly by the engineers

um

the engineers proposed the products

they talked to customers um they tried to produce very high quality products and um

put them in the market

and then the marketing arm of deck was not

i would not say

during those years was really strong

uh

i think it became strong

after that

much stronger

because it

the

the focus of the company became much more marketing oriented than it was engineering oriented

but microsoft was very marketing oriented

microsoft was

um

they

well

they marketed the pc software doss to ibm

um

so they were very

um

more marketing oriented

which you know

i thought was

um

i like that

because i liked it and i didn't like it

i liked it

because it was going to be

i was going to have a a group of marketing people

that were really going to be out hawking the projects

or products

on the other hand

i i didn't like it

because they might have their fingers in what we were going to do

and it turned out that the original version of nt

um

was pretty much an engineering deriven thing

except for a couple of things

and that was that

um

the

in addition to being portable

microsoft wanted this system to be compatible with multiple operating environments

so that sort of let us to an architecture within uh nt

that would allow uh

different subsystem personalities

and so we had

we had to keep ibm happy and run os2

of course

we want to run dos

and then the other thing that was

um big was very popular

i big

it was popular was posix

these are the

uh

the standardized unix interfaces

so the personality of this thing was going to be this multifaceted thing

um

so

um

see

i'm trying to think

why hard did i go down this rout

well

it was kind of like you

you

you

oh

okay

we're dropped in

drop in and i

so

so

anyway

the microsoft people or microsoft sort of dedicated that level

but none of the rest of the level

the rest of the level was pretty engineering

uh

driven

and we set about um

designing windows nt

much in the same way that we had set about designing vms

except that in the

in terms of

uh

windows nt

uh

we decided to produce a much more more detailed specification of the system and vms

we sort of had

we had this small group and we spent a lot of time talking about things

and we

we did do some specs

but they were pretty rudimentary specs for nt

# Chapter 7

anyway

the microsoft people or microsoft sort of dedicated that level

but none of the rest of the level

the rest of the level was pretty engineering

uh

driven

and we set about um

designing windows nt

much in the same way that we had set about designing vms

except that in the

in terms of

uh

windows nt

uh

we decided to produce a much more more detailed specification of the system and vms

we sort of had

we had this small group and we spent a lot of time talking about things

and we

we did do some specs

but they were pretty rudimentary specs for nt

we wrote a humongous spec

and i'd say it was over six months about how the whole system would work so

that people could pick up the spec new

as new people came in

they could pick up the spec

and understand understand it and read the code and actually kind of understand what was going to go on

our first projected um

uh

delivery date for the os was like two years

now

it actually took us five years to produce the first os

um

i could have never

if you'asked me

even today

if it would have taken five years back

then i would have said no

it's so we can do it in two years

but there was so much more to do

um

vms did not have a graphical user interface

we had to do

that we didn't have the subsystem problem in in vms we had are running multiple personalities

we had to run the pdp1 binaries

and we produced what was called the ame

which was the application migration executive

and we ran all the

in fact

that's how we got the vms software out was by running the 11 software

completely unconstrained architecture

in the in the in the io

and so in the pc

yeah

and so

um

we had a lot more to do and and we

we

you know

we started out with this

um

this idea that we're going to produce the first risk pc

and we're going to produce a software for it and we and we make this

well

i i can't say that we make

we make this mistake

this mistake has already been made for us

when we get there

is

is intel

at the time is producing the i860

and this is um

one of the fastest risk machines in certain applications

and those applications are mainly graphics

so microsoft wanted to to use

that is the microprocessor for our first reference implementation

we're going to build a reference implementation

we of the 860 and and we got one of the um

the oems

uh

which

which was aletti that signed up to build this

so we were going to build the reference system and they were going to take the design

um

make it manufacturable and manufacture it

we were in a build a software

uh

but then a partway through that

we

we found out that the 860 was pretty sick

it had a lot of arata

that would make it

um

pretty unusable

is an os based system

um

it had some quirks that were made it very nice for the graphics world

but not very well for the

for the operating system world

had it virtually tag cash

so basically

every time you switch context

you sweep the cash because it has all the virtual tags from the last address space you ran in

so anyway it took five years to do the first version

um

so there

i guess your original question was how different was the environment

well

the environment was a lot different

because deck was a engineer

ing run company and we're always based on engineering excellence

microsoft

i

i think

um

justifiably

i would say it's a marketing based company and they weren't um

based on engineering excellence

so there was sort of a a little clash between our culture

um

and the microsoft culture

but i think that we instilled a lot of that into the microsoft culture

but we still had a lot of things going on that were sort of out outside our our

um

our control that we within the microsoft culture

so

um

that made it made the project a lot longer

um

and the fire was very different somewhere along the word you said to me

you know there a lot of coders at microsoft

but no software engineering

and you had to bring the discipline of software engineering

microsoft

that

um

one of the things that we brought was the engineering discipline on building software

um

and i don't think that that microsoft had the engineering discipline that we had at that time

um

of course

it's

you know

that's 28 years ago

it's a long time and and um

the discipline at microsoft now is

is i would say

is excellent

um

there's

there's a lot of stuff in place

it's

it's not the same atmosphere that we had with the original nt team

because it was

our team was small

you know

we started out with 25 guys

um

the the end of version one were 150

at the end of version four

we're 400

which is

um

big

today is 4,

000

so now

along the way

uh

a lot of things get added to what nt is

i guess you had program managers or some

that was

i think the title that

um

as far as the the culture and environment

um

you know

at deck

we had program manager

but but program managers were sort of

um

sort of

they were quasi marketing people

in some sense

um

they didn't try to manage the engineering effort

the engineering effort was managed by the engineering people

so there was a big clash in the beginning

when between me and the the program managers of of microsoft over who did what

and i i wrote

i i wish i could find this piece of mail i wrote

but i wrote this big thing

big big piece of mail to our program manager about his job and mine

which laid out what i thought his job was and what my job was

and

uh

so that pretty much worked its way itself out

because we pretty much operated the way we did it

deck

but over time program managers at microsoft have taken a a more

uh

direct um involvement and control over what happens

so the you have this enormously complicated thing

multiple platforms

you're going to run on portability

um

keeping control of this and keeping everybody moving for five years gets to be quite a challenge

so the so

a little bit about the compa or the uh

the complexity of what we're building

now we talked about the 860 and the problems with the 860

well

partway down the road

you know we'd only went about a year

and we decided there's no way we can go with the 860

and so i said

well

what should we do

so he said

well

how about myips

myips is doing the r4000 that that's the platform that we ought to make the first one

so our hardware group switched to the r4000 and we started

uh

to

uh

go in that direction

and now this just to make a lot of difference to the operating system

because the way the operating system is structured or was structured

was we

we sort of taking the the stuff that was absolutely portable and it was still portable

and then the stuff

that was hardware architecture specific was divided out so that you just had to to replace that

so the first thing that happened was deck got wind of what we're doing and says

well

gez

we're building an r3000 workstation why don't you support the r3000 to

so

i guess

foolishly

we said

okay

we'll support the 3, 000 too well

well

that put us into some difficulty now

because the 3, 000 is not entirely compatible with the 4, 000

so now we're building for two two platforms

so we have the r3000

the r4000 and not long after said

well

you know

it looks like it's going to be a little while longer than we thought

maybe we should add the 386 back into the mix

here

you know

intel's coming out with a

i think it's a 38625 25 megahertz um

let's add that in

so now we start

uh

we

don't

we aren't building any hardware because there's a

there is the industry infrastructure to build x86 based system

so we don't do anything there

and

um

so now we're building for b

basically three targets and three operating environments and the gooey stuff

and now along

comes deck back with alpha and says gez

we want to run windows on alpha too

and so we said

okay

so we started doing alpha

and then ibm says

well

geez

as long as you're doing all that

let's do the power pc

so we're doing actually four platforms

we're doing four platforms

if you only count myips one

if you count them

two

then we're doing five

in addition

what happened was somewhere in the in the early 90s we had

we had this thing on the 16

it ran on doss

that was a um a layer

it just it was a program that ran on top of doss

it was called windows

we did windows 1

the industry said hoam

we did industry or windows 2

the industry said ham

we did windows 3

the window

the industry said ham

we we did windows 3. 1

we sold 16 million copies in 6 months

it was like unbelievable

so bill says

hm

i guess our major

our main operating environment will not be os2 anymore

it will be windows

so we switched from our main operating environment being os2 with the program manager

which was their graphical univ interface to windows

and when we brought in windows

then we brought brought in also all the compatibility requirements with windows 16

so we're running on all these platforms

we're running these different environments

we're running a 16bit doss emulator

we're running a 16bit windows on windows emulator

we're running

uh

windows 32bit emulators on alpha power pc and myips

all those things to to get to the first release

now

the first release actually only supported myips and and um the x86

then i think

about six months later we did another project called daytona

which was another release

and that included alpha

which was 35

and then

about six months later we did the power pc

so that's kind of why it took five years

oh yeah

easy to understand

in retrospect

lots of things changed

lots of things changed

so keeping the team going

you know

here's the the dave cutler

infamous management style at work

uh

talk about keeping the team going

uh

well

you know i'i've um

i

i

i said earlier that i'm always consider myself as a leader

not a manager

so i've always tried to be a leader

that is part of the team versus somebody that is separated from the team

so i'm always a part of the team

if the team is stressed and up against the wall

then i'm stressed and up against the wall

so

um

i think we did

we didn't have any um problems with um

people burned out

you know

people pretty much

uh

stood the whole five years

although there were some ramification

i mean people got divorced

you know

there other things that happened and we had very little attrition

i mean just really small attrition

um

everybody believed in the product

and the other thing we did was we did

we

we did this

uh

every every friday night

we had a party

we called it the whim

and the whim was the weekly integration meeting

and it

it was

it was instigated by a guy named dave thompson

who was in the network group

because we pulled in

we eventually pulled in the network group

um

originally in the pc world

the network group was separate from the operating system group

and it was just an add-on you know

it was just

it's some other program

if you want to do network operations

you ran a program to do that

it wasn't building the operating system

and we had planned all along to build it into the operating system with the vms model

so we're growing pretty rapidly as we're pulling in some of these groups and we're growing from you know

20 people to 150 or or whatever

and so he said

well

why don't we have this

we'll have a meeting every friday afternoon and we'll get

you know

beer and pizza and chips and we'll meet

and

um

just everybody will get to know each other

so this grew into a huge thing

i mean i can imagine five years and every friday night that you're doing this

you know

we start out

we're in a room about this size

and we end up in a huge room and we start out that that i send the development managers

there's

there's like four development managers under me

um

i send them down to safeway to buy a few beers

and pick up some pizza and bring them back to the to the end

when where we have full catering from marriott

may marot's bring in everything

and and we go from

you know

like

um

uh

chips and salsa and beer and pizza to uh

shrimp

and you know all sorts of stuff that's catered kegs of beer

i mean it was

it

was

it was interesting

and then there were some things where you know

we always have

uh

something going on where

um

we try to

uh

to

uh

get people to feel better about what's going on and how much stress they're in

i know there's some people that felt they were under a lot of stress and sometimes they break

but i think generally we held everything together pretty good
