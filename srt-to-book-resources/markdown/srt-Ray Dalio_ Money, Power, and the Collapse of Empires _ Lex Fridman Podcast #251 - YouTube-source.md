# Chapter 1

the following is a conversation with ray dalio

his second time on the podcast

he is a legendary investor

founder of bridgewater associates

author of a book i highly recommend

called principles

and also a new book called principles for dealing with a changing world order

that looks at the geopolitics of today

especially us and china

to the lens of history

providing a fascinating model for the rise

and fall of empires that can be applied to the analysis of our world

today

this is the lex friedman podcast to support it

please check out our sponsors in the description

and now here's my conversation with ray dalio

when you look at the history of the world as you have done in your new book

principles of dealing with the changing world order

what is more important

more

impactful

money or power

they go hand in hand

they support each other and they

um

compete with each other

those who have money

have power

a certain type of power

um

that power has to do with all that they can buy

but it also has the ability to influence those with political power

so

um

and

and so you see this throughout history

this symbiotic relationship

you know

um

for example

between

um

the royal families

the nobility and the church

so you see that group of people supporting each other in various ways

and then wrestling around with each other for the money and power among that group

so the dynamic that's quite classic is you could look at the parties in power back in

you know the 16th 17th centuries

you would look at

uh

royal families

nobles and um

and the church

if you're in europe

and then you would look at agricultural land and there was a certain dynamic

and that varies over time

it changes as those people get thrown out and technology changes

so when we evolved

when the society evolved so that it would produce goods and services

and you have something like the industrial revolution

the first industrial revolution

you have machines and you have the talent of people that are off the farms

and then you have a struggling for power

you see that power mix change

and so we don't see that same power mix anymore

but you still see the same dynamic

you see those with money

dealing with those who have political power around those assets that are considered most valuable to

particularly the productive assets that produce money

and political power is usually centered around nation state

so the major locus there's of power is the nations

yes

in 1668

after 30 years of war

there was the development of nation states

before then we had

it was really the development of countries

as we know it

that there were borders and that within those borders

uh

those who had control got to control it

and there was not to be intrusions in those borders

and that's how we established the nation state

and then

of course

within each country

there is levels

there is a central level

and then there is a typically a province or state level down below

and then there's a municipal level

so they each have different levels of power

and it's the coordination of those that determines how the country is run

you write that the quote archetypal big cycle governs the rising and declining empires and influences everything about them

including their currencies and markets

the most important three cycles are the ones you mentioned in the introduction

the long-term debt and capital market cycle

the internal order and disorder cycle and the external order and disorder cycle

can you describe this big cycle

there are two orders

there is an order by a sip order

i mean a system

how the system works

so there's an internal order

that is the internal governance system and it's usually set out in a constitution or some agreements

and then there's the world order

uh

how the world system

so

for example

in 1945

um

at the end of a war

which is basically a fight for determining the world order

um

the winners of the fight got together and created the world system

as we now know it

44

they created the brenton woods monetary system that determined the money pretty much

and because the united states won and had 80 percent of the world's money

gold was money then and had 80 of the world's gold

and it was half the world economy and it was the great military power

the order was built around an american world order

so that the united nations was in new york

the world bank and the imf were in washington and they built that new order

so classically

you have a war to determine whose rules we're following and then you have

um

the new water beings constructed after that

there is usually period of extended peace and prosperity

uh

peace suits prosperity

um

and so there's not

and the reason you have the peace is because no one wants to fight with the um dominant power

you know you're going to lose

you've surrendered

there's been the surrendering

they carve up the world

they say what it's going to look like

who's going to control what

and then you come into that period of of peace and then prosperity

where then there's uh

a working together

usually at that point you've wiped out a lot of the debt

you've wiped out a lot of the issues

the class warfare and so on

and then there's good working together

so those great periods um such as the industrial revolution in the late 1800s

or what we've experienced in the post-world war ii period are peaceful and prosperous periods led largely

by the dominant world power over a period of time

since really 1500

and maybe before but really 1500

when the dutch invented capitalism

and what i mean by that they invest

invented the first capital markets

the first stocks and the first stock market

um

that since then

capitalism has been an effective tool for building wealth because it got resources into the hands of inventive people

that's when we moved from agriculture to the importance of inventiveness of people

they got resources and then they built that prosperity in that process of doing that

they create wealth gaps

naturally

those who make a lot of money make a lot more and than those that don't

and it also produces opportunity gaps

because

uh

for example

those who earn a lot of money have that wealth

they have the power to educate their children in a way that others don't

and the gaps grow and also the debts grow at that time

when they go around the world with their competitiveness

they earn a lot of money

so

for example

the dutch

the dutch empire learned how to build ships

um

and that would go around the world

a key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle is the improvement of education and by education

i mean the skills that come from education

but also civility

the ability to deal with

well together

so the dutch invented ships that could go around the world and they had military power

but they were also very inventive

society

25 of the world's new inventions came from the dutch

and so

as they went around the world

they also brought their currency and they brought their military

they needed their

the currency they paid for things

um

and that currency

and then the more that happens

the more that becomes a reserve currency

and then they have their military

so they need their military strength

and so you see it evolve in all of those ways

but over a period of time

um

as they become more successful and more expensive

um

they became

they become more expensive

um

and and newer countries come along like um

the uk

um

then

uh

be learned to build ships from a lot

the dutch and could do that less expensively

and also

when they become more expensive

so less competitive

and also the work ethic begins to change

they believe that since they're richer

they can enjoy life more

they don't have to work quite as hard

and so you start to see the tilt

now you start to see the development of the top and

when you have a world reserve currency that allows you to borrow a lot of money

because those who want to save

want to hold your money

and that means that they'll lend you money

and so those countries get deeper into debt

so you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness and they

um

and they get themselves into financial circumstances

which are not good and they have large wealth gaps

which set the stage for downturns

and when they have downturns

um

the first question is

do they have enough money

and traditionally you know

uh

money is

is resources

um

so you classically see that the coffers are bare

that they're spending more money than their than they are earning

and they run out of money in the coffers and their granaries are empty rather than stocked

so that they give them the buffer

and as that deteriorates

that's that worsens conditions

and if they have a rival power

that's also challenging them

they see greater internal conflict over wealth

and then they have the problems internally and the problems externally

which usually results in an internal war

or an external war that leads to the change in the to the new world order

and to you

the dutch empire is a good example that

the british

what are some of the key examples that you think about in the book of this process

that follow the big cycle

well

the leading reserve currency empires

but it applies to all the empires

um

were the

the dutch

the british

uh

the american and the chinese

um

but

um

you could follow the same pattern

um

in the book i

it was very important for me to not just use words and concepts because that's subjective

it was very important for me to use actual measurements

so as you see

in the book

you can see every level of this

you can see

where is the education level

what is the military power

each one of those

and you could see them back going over the 500 years

and so

um

you can see the arcs and the composition of those arcs

and what you see is really in most countries

in most dynasties you can see that

but you also can see through those numbers

the health

um

of those countries today

um

there are

there are statistics that you could

that are in the book that show what is the level of education

what is the letter level of economic output

what is the level of um military strength

what is the level of a number of different measures of strength

so that you can then compare that

and i think that because there are objective measures of strength that you could see change

that shows the picture of where we are today

and i think one of the most important things about the book is

that it allows people to monitor how those things are transpiring

i think for policy makers

um

you know

are your policy policymakers doing a good job

and there's so much subjectivity in that

but i think it's very simple if those lines on the chart are improving

if your health index is improving

then you're moving toward a better life

so that's what the book works like

also it was used to create a model for the future

in other words

there are cause effect relationships

everything that happens has reasons

causes that preceded it

that made it happen

and so by having all those in numbers

one can see the probabilities of certain things happening

so

um

that's what

that's what you see in in the book

it's not just

you know

rey's interpretation

i didn't want to make it raise interpretation

because i don't know if i'm right

yeah

so one of the fascinating things in the book

so you have list these 18 measures

and there's like a little scorecard for the countries of the world today

# Chapter 2

in other words

there are cause effect relationships

everything that happens has reasons

causes that preceded it

that made it happen

and so by having all those in numbers

one can see the probabilities of certain things happening

so

um

that's what

that's what you see in in the book

it's not just

you know

rey's interpretation

i didn't want to make it raise interpretation

because i don't know if i'm right

yeah

so one of the fascinating things in the book

so you have list these 18 measures

and there's like a little scorecard for the countries of the world today

so let's say u.

s china

and europe and what it was 20 years ago and looking at the change from 20 years ago

and that's another indicator to change itself to see where things are headed

maybe

can you comment on

from a score perspective

how is u. s and china

doing and in the 18 measures

what are some measures that stand out to you

is particularly important to think about today

for the united states

for china

well

there are a number

um

financially

what you see in the united states is that

um

we're borrowing a lot more money

creating a lot of debt and we're

uh

printing a lot of money and our capacity to do that is very much is limited

first of all

because

um

when you

when there's a sale of a bond

when the government borrows more than it borrows money

because it spends more than it takes in

um

you have to sell a bond and the world right now has a lot of us dollar denominated bonds

because as the world's reserve currency

they sell sold on them

and they have very bad returns

negative real returns

negative

real returns

significantly

and so on

so that um means that more bonds has to be sold than um are bought

and

that means

that the federal reserve has is faced with the choice of having to raise the interest rate to curtail borrowing

which slows the economy and hurts the markets

or by filling that difference and producing money

the debt monetization

which produces an inflation in goods

services and financial assets

so in that regard

that's our the united states's position

in china's case

its balance of payments

um

is a better

um

china has displaced the united states as the world's largest trading country

in other words

more exports to other countries and as a result

it's economically competitive

but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency

it's a real blessing

so the united states

it has the world's reserve currency

but it is risking it because of this imbalance

so if you look at history

you see that those go slowly

but when they go eventually

they go quickly

so there's a risk of of of that financially

then there's the issue of

uh

internal order

so i'm just giving you the major ones

but i'll get into some of the other ones too right now

um

there's a lot of internal conflict in the united states

uh

which affects its

and um

how well it works

um

in china

there's less internal conflict because it's a more autocratic state

but also they've created this bifurcation of what is political and what is um economic

in terms of producing that prosperity

so if you stay out of the politics pretty much um

and then you're seeing um entrepreneurship

you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on

and so that internal working

um

you know that's subject to different people's

interpretations

whether they like it or not

but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds of measures is

is less sorry to pause on that for a second

so these measures

i guess you don't want to sort of um

romanticize any one measure or something like that

over interpret any one measure

but is internal conflict

always a bad thing is some

is this

uh

is it a complicated calculation

or do you kind of the way we think about these measures that you've presented

we should be thinking like the higher

the better

the lower worse

or i mean

of course

depending on

well

in many cases

the conflict that produces the revolution produces revolutionary changes that lead to resolutions that and lead to new starts

and so their short term

a short-term civil war is a hellacious experience

and at the same time it can be

um

the transition to a new beginning

um

also

there are different types of conflict

uh

competition

which makes things makes everything better

is

is a productive conflict

whereas destructive conflicts are not good over the short time

so you know that's how that those go

so

within each measure

the story is complicated

yeah

but my measures are are sort of clear meaning

how much political conflict

how much social conflict

in other words

you can measure conflict

you can measure fighting

you can measure crime rates

you can measure

um

lots of different ways of conflict

so the measures are a composite of different types of internal conflict

what are some other interesting measures

maybe if you can also mention

like

for me

in particular interest is education and innovation

yes

the classic cycle

the most important leading indicator is the quality of education

most importantly

broad-based education

drawn as a from the largest population

because you can never tell who the talent is going to be

so where they're going to come from

so

for example

if you look at the chinese dynasties

the great chinese dynasties

um

and the confucian approach

it was meritocratic

of um

everybody could sit for exams and so

on broad base of drawing in the populations and you see that

if you go across societies

because that draws on the largest number of population to get education

and it also

um

that creates

um

a reality and a perception that the system is fairer

equal opportunity

not just one of privilege

and that helps to create social stability

but education is not just

uh

education in understanding facts and so on

it is education and um

civility of how to behave together

and so if they're smart

they understand how to be productive

because they work well together and they're productive

and then that leads to the next stage

you could see

in the lines in the charts

we i plotted these so that you could see in a typical cycle

you could see that education is the long leading indicator

and then you could see

as you mentioned that you

what you see is inventiveness and technology measures then follow

and you see

then also competitiveness in world markets

follows

for example

in the early stages of a cycle

the industries that they go into um

tend to be very basic industry

because they have cheap labor

something like textiles and simple manufactured goods

and so on

but as the education rises

then they move up the value chain to uh tech

greater technologies and so on

which raises incomes and raises productivity

so yes

those

and

and you know

as you say

there are 18 different measures like that

but education

um

and then civility and the inventiveness

so you see it reflected in in who's inventing what

um

and that corresponds

then who's trading with

who's a big trading country and where's the value of economic output and what are per capita incomes

they all follow those arcs

yeah

like you said

the fascinating thing about your book

so there's philosophy

there's wisdom

uh

but there's plots

yeah

you can see it

so it's not just your opinion

it's kind of like

uh

you can interpret it any way you like

uh

but you're just giving a lot of of your own insights along with the numbers

if you were to look at the american nation

the american empire and the trajectory is looking into the future

given these measures

what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse of the american empire

based on these measures

what are the concerning indicators

and if

um

if those break down further

what does that look like

well

all of those indicators are concerning

um

maybe except for one

which is technology

the technology niche

although

even in that area

the united states is improving at a slower rate than is china

for various advantages that they have there

they put out about eight times as many computer engineers

they have free data

and so on

but if you look at them so the financial is a is a concern

the internal order disorder is a concern

then if you look at education levels

the united states is in many way is is losing its educational advantage

if you were to look at

compare it with china

if you take general public education in the united states

it's deteriorated tremendously even in comparison to developed countries

there are scores pieces scores

and so on

and it's

you know

something like 38th in the world or something

and that was a big plunge

average public education

if you look at the best universities in the world

the united states is unique in having the best universities in the world

so there are these privileged spots

um that are

you know

excellent

uniquely

excellent

so when you look at the comparison

education in china is improving rapidly and it

and the quantity is a quantity of educated people in the areas that they're moving in

are

is is greater and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater

and so you see

the results are greater

um

but

um

it's sort of along the lines that i'm i'm dealing with

if you were to follow through in terms of um

actual productions

i i think

uh

you

you know

in terms of technologies

um

there are some areas that the united states is in a lead at the moment

there's some areas that china's in a lead

but china's gaining very quickly when i first went to china

1984

i would bring 10 calculators

and i gave them away as gifts to high ranking people and they thought they were miracle devices

um

right now

in terms of areas like quantum computing and a. i

and

and you know many areas

you have a race going on

and so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness

not just look at the current level

you have a situation where they're improving at a much faster rate

this is all good for the world

if the world can get along

and the main thing i think is

um

in just how do you have a healthy world and how do you have a strong economy

and how do you have a strong situation

is

be strong

the united states is

war is with itself

that's the main war

you know it's very simple in history

[music] be financially sound

earn more than you spend

um

and be strong in these ways and pretty much everything will take care of itself

but you make it sound simple

of course

because there's a momentum when things degrade when the education system degrades when you start borrowing

when

um

i mean all of these indicators once

once they start going down

it's

uh

there's a momentum to it right

so it's hard to reverse it right

and there are circumstances that you're then in

uh

for example

indebtedness

you know it's politically desirable for those in to borrow money and spend

because their constituencies only look at what they get and when they get a lot

they don't pay attention to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books

so it's always better to borrow spend and then leave the cleanup to the next guy

and so you inherit a lot you inherited as a new president enters in

or new legislators

they have a lot of debt

they have a broken down infrastructure

um

they don't have enough money to fix that

and so that's the lay of the land that the prior generations put you in

and there you are

and so that's right

um

it's difficult

because when you start to think

okay

what's healthy

well

spend earn more than you spend

well

that's not so easy

because you know

what does that mean

go earn more

i mean

okay

that's not so easy

spend less

that isn't going to work

so now what do you do

okay

you have this debt that you then monetize

and that's why it's classic

so

yes

that's why these cycles occur

because what has created before

put

what happened before created

the lay of the land

that is then increasingly difficult to deal with

# Chapter 3

because you know

what does that mean

go earn more

i mean

okay

that's not so easy

spend less

that isn't going to work

so now what do you do

okay

you have this debt that you then monetize

and that's why it's classic

so

yes

that's why these cycles occur

because what has created before

put

what happened before created

the lay of the land

that is then increasingly difficult to deal with

so what can great leaders do in this moment

i mean

maybe

um

my sense is leadership is crucial here

so for example

to do very large projects that invest in the education system

that sort of try to fix the fundamentals or maybe invest more

and more into the innovation and the develop development of new technologies

and so on

it feels like that just doesn't happen organically

so you have to have strong leaders that convince the populace of the importance of these ideas

well

i completely agree with your list

what we have is a situation where everybody has their opinions

and they have to sort of get them exactly right

and they all fight with each other about whether their opinions

so

the most important thing is that we are become bipartisan so that we don't

and we get over our differences

i would have a bipartisan cabinet

i would draw upon um

both members of both parties

the the moderates

who are going to be able to work together

so as then we have one country

and then we deal with those in a means

that works for the majority of the people in the middle rather than the polarity

i think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that

so i would say that's a paramount importance

because we have the resources

you know

um

wealth

real wealth and and science

and everything has never been better than it is

but the notion is that it has to work for the majority of people

and we have to keep it being productive

so that that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably work together

so that they increase the size of the pie and they create broad-based prosperity

so that is a paramount importance

whatever they do

if they do it

that way

i can say i'm happy about

because that other alternative is the really scary alternative

the

the scary alternative

the different ways it has evolved throughout history

some of it has led to wars what are the future trajectories

that lead to a potential war with china

cold war or hot war

is this something you think about

is this something you're worried about

yeah

i'd like to talk about both wars

so the war with china

as i say

there are five kinds of wars

there's a trade war

tech

um

technology

war

geopolitical

influence

war

um

capital war and military war

i

um

as far as military war goes

i only

i think it's only a taiwan issue

um

but that's a big issue

and we could talk about that for a minute

but those others there'll be

uh

rough competitions and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time

that's what that war looks like

taiwan has been for a long time

a sovereignty issue to china

and it has its roots in what's called the hundred years of humiliation

from the 1840s to 1949

foreign powers came in took advantage of china

they had the opium wars and such times

and

and that represented the 100 years of humiliation and taiwan represents

is their sovereignty and their important thing

and 50 years ago

starting 50 years ago

there was an agreement that there is one china

and taiwan is part of china and that there would be peaceful reunification

the the peaceful reunification hasn't happened

and in their view

that's a very big issue

and so it's a big contentious issue

and that

uh

could produce a military war

um

could produce a military accident

could produce a

it's a very tense situation

and if we had a military war

god help us because of the capacity in all different new ways to inflict um harm on each other

but anyway

that's that's that

if you don't have that military war

you'll have the competition between those other kinds of wars and whoever is strongest in those areas

will um win

where do you put cyber war within the five

well

cyber war is a military war

i'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're using you're referring to

is that

which it's used to inflict pain on the other party through cyber

so cyber wars

you'll see cyber war

you could see space war

you can see drone warfare

you

um

new types of warfare

not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare

but you could see any of the above

what are the defining characteristics

what are the interesting things about xi jinping

the president of china as a leader on the world stage

his father was a early leader

he was himself

[music] in the cultural revolution

at times treated brutally

um

and during that period of time

it was very

very difficult and he came up

you know

through the ranks

and he's a very intelligent man when he first came to power

they

as you know

they have two five-year terms and we're now coming to the end of the second of those five-year terms

when he first came to power

he felt that there should be a lot of reform

and reform meant moving to much more of a market

an open economy

when that happened in him coming in

i had some contact with economic policymakers

but

and the circumstances then were that five major banks lent to state-owned enterprises

and local governments with implied government guarantees

and so there was not control of that

and they

and the movement to aim more of a market economy and the development of markets

uh

was a primary and also the dealing with the corruption issue

there was a lot of corruption prior to that

and that was viewed as an existential threat to the system

so that became the primary objective

and then

as time progressed

over those 10 years

there was a a lot of changing in the world

finance

their financial circumstances

opening many

many other markets

they particularly getting money to small

and medium-sized enterprises and developing a lending system and then establishing controls on it

so right now

um

there's a vibrant

um capital markets

um

you can raise capital

you can be an entrepreneur

you can become a billionaire

um in the capital markets

and they develop the markets to be the second largest capital markets at the same time

um

they had to deal with their um

rising debt issue

which they began to deal with

uh

really about four years ago when the second term began and the um

and then uh

lu huh

became

um

the vice premier

um

responsible for that and to um and deal with uh

those issues

so you see right now that what's happening is

uh

the dealing with the real estate bubble

there was a development in real estate

a bubble which produced

um

a lot of unproductive lending

and xi ping said you know houses are meant to live in

not to speculate on

and so that was wasteful

so they established what they call three red lines

which are financial ratios that the property developers had to live within

and that is then causing the adjustments that are going on now

which in my view are very healthy

because

um

whenever there's uh

bankruptcies and so on

the most in the public

think

okay

that's a problem

it's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts and bad practices

and so

um

that's what's going on

so that's let's say

economically

at the same time

there is the changing relationships

the changing world order the changing relationships with the united states and other countries

which is becoming

um

much less cooperative and much more war-like much more confrontational

um

those two things

the the domestic debt problem and domestic has led to

um

what's called core

what they call core leadership

which means a leadership more around him

that is less challenging

because they believe in history

that during very difficult times

um

a more centrally controlled decision-making process lends itself better than to a more fragmented political contentious project

and that's basically what's going on

now you said it very eloquently

but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men

and there's a lot of centralized control

that characterization is

view

is much more black and white than it really is

uh

but it leans towards that direction they're like

for example of the standing members of the polar bureau

four are more eligi allied him three or less

so you have to understand that it's kind of a collective leadership at the top

and then

of course there's just jockeying for power

um

you know

in a highly political sense

um

at the top

uh

but no one leader can be successful against the uh

all those powers at the top

so it's very politically negotiating

it's

you know

it's very much more like

if you put um in the united states

the democrats and the republicans and they had to be in the same government and they work it out

uh

it's kind of something like that

and then

so that's that struggle

but it's an internal struggle

where do you put the importance of some of these ideas at the founding of the united states

when then now we're talking about at the context of china

the freedom of speech

freedoms

what china is doing with the central management of a lot of things

it's enabling a lot of growth

but it's also limiting people on the very basic level

in terms of freedom

the kind of freedom that i think can lead to entrepreneurship to starting new businesses

to having big dreams and chasing those dreams and then creating totally new things in whatever the space

maybe in technology

in business and whatever

what

how important is that as a metric for society

well

they have a view

which is the idea of a dialectic

which means that two things are at obvious

that everything comes with pros and cons and two opposites exist

and you want the benefits of those two opposites

and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites

right

so let's say you want the capital markets because it gets

uh money into the hands of the entrepreneurs who are motivated they build fortunes

and that drives an economy to do very well

and at the same time

um

it produces

uh

the other problems

the wealth gaps

the other problems

then the debt cycle that we're talking about

and so on

and deng xiaoping

you know

how do you reconcile communism and

um

the market economy and the capital markets

and he

uh

famously said

um

and if it doesn't matter

if it's a white cat or a black cat

just as long as it catches mice

in other words

if it

if it works in making the country richer

then that becomes the objective

and then they move that along

so there are these conflicts

um

and um

one of the leaders described it to me as follows

because it's confusion and it goes back over a period of time

there's a a hierarchy and it's an extension of

uh

the family

he described it and he said the united states is a country of individuals and individualism

and that is its vibrancy

that

um

we see the individual rights to speak up

the individual [music] protection of the individual

individual property rights and all of those things

as of uh

paramount importance

and we build our organization

that's why democracy is from the bottom up

or even a company

we'll get together and we'll be partners to proper prosper

together that is the american approach

um

he was describing that in china

it's an extension of the confucian family essentially

and so it's almost like

um

um

you know

there's a hierarchy

and so what they think about is the common good

uh

not the individualism

so

for example

if they want a high-speed rail to go from one place to another

and that's best in the common good

# Chapter 4

and we build our organization

that's why democracy is from the bottom up

or even a company

we'll get together and we'll be partners to proper prosper

together that is the american approach

um

he was describing that in china

it's an extension of the confucian family essentially

and so it's almost like

um

um

you know

there's a hierarchy

and so what they think about is the common good

uh

not the individualism

so

for example

if they want a high-speed rail to go from one place to another

and that's best in the common good

then the individual protections that would stand in the way of doing that would be of secondary concern

so that notion of uh controlling

so it

it

for example

um

the what what they're doing with

uh

video games

um

they

um

control

uh what type of video games and how many hours a day

kids can be on video games

um

operating in that way

because they believe that that's good for the society and that's very controlling in the united states

i i think probably most parents would say

leave it to me

and it's it's a matter between me and my kids

the same thing has to do with data

in other words

in the united states

who controls the data

does the company control the data

do you individually control the data

and so the inclination would be to figure that out

but nobody would say that the government is going to control the data

because of our inclination of really anti-government control in china

it would be that the government will control the data because that's going to be best for the society

and it depends who you trust

but that's so that difference in philosophy is very much at the um

you know

at the heart of that

as far as um

your question in terms of effectiveness

it really is in china's case

it's how you balance the things right

so what they're attempting to do is to create a lot of freedom and creativity

um

in areas that are not

uh

political

let's say

and and so you see

on a lot of entrepreneurship

you see a lot of product development

you see a lot of creativity

um

happening in that way

so the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening is is an old stereotype

where's a lot of creativity

certainly happening

and the system can work well if they can achieve that kind of balance

it's proven to have worked well since i started going there in 1984

per capita income

real per capita income has increased by 26 times

the um longevity rate has increased by 10 years

the poverty rate has fallen from 88 to less than 1

in terms of

you know

basics like starvation and things

and if you read history

plato's republic

you know he talks about the cycles

democracy

you know an autocratic and the benevolent despot

and all of that

each has their own vulnerability

the vulnerability of democracy

which has been a remarkable remarkable system and i don't have to extol the benefits of it

um

but the vulnerability of it has always been

uh

the um

internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy

um

in world war ii

uh

four democracies chose to be autocracies

um

because there was internal disorder and there

was

this is the belief

will somebody bring about order and get control of the situation

you know that was in

um

germany

italy

uh

japan

and spain

um

they were parliamentary dictat systems that

uh

turned themselves over to that

so both systems

um

have vulnerabilities

um

i think the main thing now that we need to think about is those vulnerabilities

democracy is an amazing system because it requ

the

the adherence to the rules

and the system

and the checks and balances is quite amazing and it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars

um

um

but there has to be the respect of the rules

and when you see something like that

they will not accept elections or they will not accept rules

and history has shown when the causes that people are behind are more important to them than the system

the system is in jeopardy

so we have a situation that's very much like that

in terms of let's say the 2024 elections

i believe that there's a very high chance that neither side will accept losing

for example

and so we

um

we have that kind of a situation

so one would hope that one could rise above the disagreements and rely on the system

uh

for resolving disagreements

because if if that doesn't happen

then we have our own

uh chaos

so the kind of the trend that started in 2020

this

or i mean

i mean

i suppose it's been there

it's been growing a rep

one representation of this internal disorder has been the growing trend of being skeptical about the results of the election

well

it started before that

there was the emergence of populism

where

before uh president

uh

trump was elected

he was basically elected as a populist

because there was a large percentage of the population that felt that the system didn't work for them

and he tapped into that and he was largely elected as a populist

leader

first

populous leader in a developed country

um

and so populism began that

then

and that was a battle of one group against the other group

and so since then it's been like that and it continued to grow

you've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy

that internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy

what's the vulnerability of a system like china

maybe one way to say is put china aside and look at history like a soviet union

what's the vulnerability of a communist type system

well

i'll call it both communist and autocratic

sure

depending on how much autocracy is that it lacks flexibility

it

it lacks

um

the ability

so

but i should deal with them differently

um

in other words

there's the economic system

the economic system

um

threatens motivation and productivity

so communism or socialism

uh

has to be done in a way where

um

you can threaten productivity

capitalism has

and what i mean by that

i mean free markets and capital markets

i have been an effective way of allocating resources and also creating the

the incentives and the resources

providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas

and so if i compare that

what the chinese have done to a large extent is to recognize that and have made a move

that's why the uh seeming dialectic or the conflict between those two things exists

but anyway

that's it

as far as an autocratic system

rather than um

one man

one vote from the population up

the risks of the autocratic system is

that there's enough discontent that arises that the system doesn't have the flexibility

and that

rather than bending

um

it breaks

um

that's that's the big risk

um

the notion of trying to control a um

if there's that

rather than giving it the flexibility

um

so that's the

that would be the big risk of the autocratic system

what's the human

uh

because you mentioned

like the top gets bigger with empires

and you start taking things for granted is the some of this just human nature

so the concern with with china with autocratic nations

the concern with the the third reich

the soviet union was that fundamentally at the individual level

the humans involved at the top they start becoming

they're starting to lose touch with reality in a way that no longer makes them

i guess that's the representation of the flexibility that you're referring to

well

i'm

i mean

in a democracy you could change

you can go as far left or as far right

you can change the leaders easily

and so the people don't become

um

you know

they pretty much only have themselves to blame

uh

yeah

you know

and one of the problems of that is they may not choose the best leaders

but they

they have that flexibility

so if vote and you get what you wanted in the case of the autocratic

let's say

leaders

and then the movement from democracies to autocracies

what you see

normally that movement is that one of the systems

is

it is not working

let's say the democracy is not effectively

everybody's arguing with each other and nobody's getting anything done

and you know

like mussolini

the trains are not running on time

and that would be the example

jesus

this place has gotten chaotic

will somebody get into control and then they

then you get the autocratic um

and then he's autocratic enough to boss people around and um

and then you follow those kinds of orders

and it's like a

maybe a ceo in a powerful company ordering around

and that could work well

or it could work badly

you know

most um companies are run as

um

like autocracies in a sense

you know there's the hierarchy and you the command economy and that kind of thing

and now that can work well or not

um

but then what

quite often

when you get the populist

autocratic

their personality is something that they want to fight

and they become more nationalistic

and they tend to become more militaristic and human nature at that stage lends itself to fighting

there's an arc here that when we think it's we think of a country

um

and we say we

when we think of a country

um

it's not true

it's not like that there are individuals who change

one generation dies and another generation comes along

and one of those arcs is that

um

the ones who have been through war don't want to go to war and are more happily

you know

willing to

um

abide by whatever the rules are

as you get farther along into that cycle

and you get a new generation and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars

then they

um

then they want to

uh

uh

fight

and so you're seeing right now

the emergent of fight for right

and and what that means is you see it internally

uh

fight

where are you and fight for that thing

and they mean fight and then into externally

fight are you going to be

uh

the strong one who will fight and win and that develops

on both sides

this fight and win and each side is cheering each other on into

uh

a war

but that's comes by those who really have not experienced war

because it comes in their part of their lifetime

humans are fascinating

humans are fascinating

and by the way

human nature has not changed over the thousands of years

so it's the

it's so interesting

because

like in doing this study and it comes across in the study

it's like watching the same movie over and over again

you

you know

you see the ark

and you see it happen over

and over again the only things that seem to change are the clothes people wear and the technologies

uh

yeah

and then somebody probably will disagree with you about the clothes

maybe there's also cycles within fashions

maybe we're not even creative there

uh

what do you um make of

uh

russia and vladimir putin

what do you think about putin as a leader as a human being on this world stage

within the context of the cycles of empires that you think about

well

putin came to power at the failure of russia's last order

so there was

there was the end of communism and there was the development of the market economy

the collapse of the soviet union

and at that

time he was appointed by yeltsin

who was an alcoholic and had problems managing and was put into power

and the conditions in the russian were the work

there was anarchy

um

there was no money

it was

it had the classic end of cycle ingredients

it was broke

it was people were fighting with each other

was the anarchy

and that's when he came to power and

um

there were not institutions

the whole thing had collapsed and it was not effective

ministry of education

ministry of anything

and so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability

and they needed a democracy and they needed the the improvement of capital markets

um

so he's been in that position as

a

um

as i guess i would call him

um

a semi-autocratic leader in that

from all indications

he would respect the democracy

um

# Chapter 5

it was people were fighting with each other

was the anarchy

and that's when he came to power and

um

there were not institutions

the whole thing had collapsed and it was not effective

ministry of education

ministry of anything

and so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability

and they needed a democracy and they needed the the improvement of capital markets

um

so he's been in that position as

a

um

as i guess i would call him

um

a semi-autocratic leader in that

from all indications

he would respect the democracy

um

and he's very popular

he's won democratic elections because he's been a strong leader and he's brought uh

peace and stability to the soviet u

to

to russia

after the breakup of the soviet union

and

um

he's a strong leader in pursuit of the the country's interests in

um

a way where russia is not a significant economic power and but it is a significant military power

um

so

um

the issues

and then there's a strong alliance between russia and china

now

um

so

that's kind of the lay of the land

and then there are sensitivities

the ukraine issue is

uh

a sensitivity

um

because of

there are a lot of russians who live in the ukraine

and there's also the issue of nato on it

on their border

um

so there are those kinds of things

and he has military power and he has a strong alliance with china

um

and i guess that's my best summary of

um

what his position is strong leader

um

popular

um

[music] these are not subjective interpretations

these are

uh

objective interpretations

yeah

it's interesting

just in this conversation

you're not sort of um

doing the usual criticism

of any one particular system

you're looking at these systems from the perspective of history

you're just describing how they work

it's often times

when you talk about what russia is today

or what the soviet union was or what china is today is you start to criticize

well

they

they do this kind of censorship or they do this kind of

they limit freedoms in this kind of way

but you're just kind of describing this as a nation with ideas

what they think is right

this is how they hope to get it to work

this is why it's working

this is what's not working

here's metrics that show that it's not working

i think that's a refreshing way to think about it

it's easy

though

i mean you got some criticism

um

saying that

i think china's a strict parent

um

you know

some people criticize these countries for doing

uh

so for violating human rights

i suppose there's some people that criticize the united states violating human rights

but what are your thoughts on the world stage today about some of the behaviors of this government in terms of respecting the rights

the basic rights of human beings

you described accurately

how i just try to look at things in an um

a non

i don't want to impute my values yes on anybody

um

i mean there are intolerable things

so i'm not saying there aren't intolerable things

but

um

one of the great things of being an american here is

that i grew up with all different nationalities having all different points of view

and all different religions and all different ways of operating

and i've come to treasure the fact that that is

you know

what's their

business

is their business

and then the question is

where do you cross the line

under what circumstances that that others have got to do it my way

and then

when you do it internationally

uh

the ob

the issue of what is a sovereign state

you know which

um

as i say in the piece of west failure and you have borders

and you

then

when do you cross the line

that

um

my way of doing things has got to be their way of doing things

or what are the various rights

and so that's a very

uh

delicate question or a very difficult question

and we all have responsibilities to different parties

and we all have different levels of knowledge about those particular things

so

um

so

for example

as an international investor

i have a responsibility to my investors

those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs of how do they run that

so if you're taking nike or stinkers and so on

and americans can decide whether they want to buy product

chinese products or not buy chinese products

we are all faced with those types of choices

so you have what do you want to do in your constituency and you have your choices

and then

beyond that

in many cases

the issues are quite complex

like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it

so

um

uh

and then i i believe that if if you disconnected

if all those

if entities like myself

the businesses

uh

doing business with china disconnected

i think that that would be disastrous

economically disastrous

and it would also be um reduce

um

the

the understanding that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars

and so these are all complicated

so what we do is

uh

and and who makes it

my opinion matters the most

why should it be my opinion

that matters the most in making that decision

so i largely look at the guide

the government guidance that i get not only from my own government but from the other governments

and i follow the rules

i'm in 40

we invest in 40 countries

and we want to do that in the best way to provide the diversified portfolio

and we sort of need that every one of those countries has similar complexities

there are always one issue or another and then

and there's only so much that we really understand about all of those issues

so we rely largely on the guidance that we you have

get empathize and show respect to the the culture of the place

the way things are done

you don't necessarily

um

the way you heal relationships between nations is like

like you said

you work together

and that requires kind of um to listen

maybe more than you talk

and i think people in the public sphere

uh

talk a lot about china without really listening

without understanding much about china

without one of the things that makes me really sad

because i know how to speak russian and i can

i know how much is lost in translation

it makes me sad that i'll never really get to know the chinese culture

because

like i'll never really get to know the language

the literature

the just talk to regular people

it's not just the government or officials or scientists

just regular folks

get the culture

i think

if you don't understand the culture

uh

just the basics of the human nature of what people love about their country

about their family or the kind of hopes they have

you know what kind of values they have without that

you're not going to be able to um

fully

um connect with them

and you have to do that first to have a chance of building a good world

i couldn't agree with you more

i was very lucky

because

as i say

uh

you know

since 1984

so

for more than half of my life i've been going there

and i and the common people and all sorts of people

and i've got to meet them

i don't speak the language

but it a combination of through translators or men

them speaking english and being in situations

i had my son go to school

a local school and we

we developed those kinds of understandings

i think that

um

but the not wanting to know the other perspective is the thing that's most scary

yeah

like i'm right now in the middle and um

and all i want to try to do is to help mutual understanding

you're right if there were questions probing me asking me what is it

i'm not on one side or another

i get

i don't want to be on one side or another

i believe that each has their right within there to approach their different culture in their own way

so many ways you gave an example it

uh

um

if they're not

um

doing harm to others

i mean so

but that issue of um trying to understand is so much better

that doesn't mean agree with

if you are wanting to out-clever and out-compete somebody

it still pays to understand what they're thinking

so

to achieve understanding of what they're thinking even if you want to go to war with them

that understanding is the best thing to have

what we have now is a situation in which there's an enemy mentality

and that means that anything that serves the

seems to be like understanding

or conveying understanding seems to mistakenly create the notion of i'm on their side in a war

and that's kind of a dangerous thing

because

um

there's a momentum here to fight henry kissinger

praises your new book and you thank him in it in the dedication

what's your relationship like with him

what makes him interesting

maybe

what makes him controversial

what makes him such a central figure in history the first

most importantly

he's unique about seeing things through all the others eyes

so if you were

it's like there's a chess game

i mean

i think geopolit geopolitics is like a chess game

but with multiple chess players playing the same game

yes

so imagine there are six people around playing the chess game

and he could sit in each seat

and he could know how they see it okay

and see it in a calm way of how they see it

he's unique in that way

he's 98 years old and he's equally able to do that

and he has a background that

in which he's a historian

so he really understands history

super

um

he doesn't understand economic history as much

so that's why

to some extent we enjoy having a conversation

because he's interested in the act and in the economic piece

he doesn't know

and i'm so interested in the geopolitical piece that i don't know as well

but anyway

he's able to do that

but not only a historian but a practitioner

so

when you go from an academic to a practitioner who has

that talent to see things through others eyes in an objective way

and to be strategic rather than just tactical

that's a very special person

and that's why henry is

uh

to me a very special person

yeah

he's lived a fascinating life

just all all of the world events he's been involved in is fascinating

and like you said

that's such an interesting skill to have to consider

what are the concerns

the hope

the dreams

the fears of the

all the people at the table

what are they thinking

i find that people don't once again

don't do that enough

when it's the obvious thing you should be doing

whether it's business deals or um

political negotiation or geopolitical negotiation

i'm often surprised again

sorry to go to the russian thing

because i i i hear

sort of like

i hear putin talk in russian and you start to infer certain intentions and like not the trivial stuff

like the human being

what is what is that human being hoping for himself for his country

for his

close in a circle for the bigger like

and i i just see that that's often just lost in translation

i just see

like american leaders talking to putin

and it's just not

it's

there's not a connection

absolutely

i know exactly what you're talking about you

i

it has never failed that in my listening to a conversation and or even reading a speech

or

and you see

then it reported

the inevitably the reporter picked some headline characterization

that has very little to do with what was really happening

but might be a headline grabber

that's at some kind of distortion and there's a lack of understanding of really what's going on

if it's okay

let me ask you a couple questions about cryptocurrency

uh

you've had a few opinions about bitcoin over the years

what are your thoughts about bitcoin today

its role in the global financial system and just in human society

in general

well

the evolution of bitcoin over the years is one of the things that has influenced changes

in my view

it has proven itself something like 10

11 years ago

imagine the programming of this

and here's the

you throw it out

and that's the idea

it has not been hacked

it has

um

um

operated

it is built

it has come an amazing way

um

over that 11 years to be

um

maybe probably the most excited topic among a lot of people

um and has been used and and is now um has obtained

you know the status of having imputed value at the same time

it is one of those assets that is an alternative money

i think we're entering an era where um

there's going to be a competition of monies

um

because of the printing of fiat money

um

and the depreciated value

there will be a competition of monies

um

and bitcoin is part of that competition

but there'll be many monies

not just crypto monies

but there'll be central bank crypto monies

um

but they'll be

# Chapter 6

over that 11 years to be

um

maybe probably the most excited topic among a lot of people

um and has been used and and is now um has obtained

you know the status of having imputed value at the same time

it is one of those assets that is an alternative money

i think we're entering an era where um

there's going to be a competition of monies

um

because of the printing of fiat money

um

and the depreciated value

there will be a competition of monies

um

and bitcoin is part of that competition

but there'll be many monies

not just crypto monies

but there'll be central bank crypto monies

um

but they'll be

uh

different kinds of monies

um

and even monies

um

are things that you buy and sell nfts can become a money

uh

a type of money

you own it

and it's an investment

and you could say i'd rather own it than own

uh

bitcoin

has ray dalia bought any nfts not yet

okay

um

but

um

only only just because

like

i

i definitely want to buy nfts to just experience them

you know

like

i think

think i should produce one

yeah

and i should

uh

i should have asked that

have you made it

have you minted an empty

you probably should

just to know what it's like

yeah

that's right

this stuff is happening

yeah

this stuff is real okay and how it operates

but like all new real things

um

some are gonna go

and so i'm gonna

you know

it's like in the internet in the year 2000

um

you know

pets. com could have been a great

but maybe pets. com doesn't make it

and who knows

that's the beauty of the competitive system

that will evolve and some things will be treasured and some things will be

uh

trashed

so

um

um

but when i look at it

um

i think we are in an environment of

you know what is an alternative money

a money has two purposes

a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth and we are looking for

and it's portable and you can

and it's best if it's recognized in other countries

um

so gold is one of those

so i look at it as an alternative gold

but i look at a number of things as alternative gold

um

and i think that

and i think

and gold is still my favorite because of certain qualities

for example

um

you can't trace it in in bitcoin

you can trace who owns it where it's going

and and so on

governments can't have that ability to trace it

and so on a gold piece of coin

it's

it's not connected

i think not connected has benefits

particularly in a world where maybe connections can be more risky

um

so

and then also gold has been for many thousands of years

universally recognized as a source of money and central banks

it's the third largest uh source of money in central bank reserves

and i don't think bitcoin is going to serve those types of purposes

and so on

so for various reasons

i prefer gold to the other

but it's a little bit part of my mix

but then you look at it

it hit

i think 69

000 this year as the high bitcoin hit

do you think it's possible

you mentioned gold

do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers like 1 million some people talk about

i don't

i don't think that's possible

because the way i look at it is

there's a certain amount of um

[music] a certain amount of it

and there's a certain amount of gold

i'll use gold as a benchmark

the amount of it is worth about five

uh

about one trillion dollars

total cryptos

about 2. 2 trillion

but let's say bitcoin

uh

it's one trillion dollars

if you take the amount of money that is in um gold

that is not used for jewelry purposes and not used by central banks

and i assume bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes or central bank purposes

um

that amount in gold is about five trillion dollars

so right now

if you were to have a portfolio that has um gold and crypto

um gold

then bitcoin

it's worth about 20 of the value of gold

do i think it's going to be

uh

worth more than gold in terms of that mix

i don't think it'll be worth more than gold

but let's say it became worth as as much as gold

i don't believe it will be

i think that 20 sounds kind of about right

i really don't know that what the right answer is

um

and then there's the question of what is all of that pool of money

that

let's say gold and gold equivalents relative to everything else

does it go from

you know

let's call it six

seven

eight trillion to sixteen trillion

maybe it could double

it depends what it is in the world environment

but basically

if you use gold as a measure

i

um

there's no

it just makes no sense that it's going to be used

um that much more

am i sure about that

i'm not sure about anything

but

logically

it seems to me

that there's a limitation on its price in relationship to other things that are like it

let me ask for your deep financial analysis on a very important issue

uh

i've just talked a couple days ago

the elon musk

he wants to put a literal dogecoin on the moon

uh

what are your thoughts about deutsche coin

uh

and

uh

do you think he'll be the official currency

maybe

uh

reserve currency on the moon and on mars

my reaction is that's cute

i remember elon

when he first got

he

he first got his money from paypal

i think he said to me it was

he got 180 million dollars

90 million dollars

he decided to say why aren't we going to outer space

and he wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified using russian technology to put a um

a plant and a watering can on the moon

um

or on mars

i think it was um

and and and he said first life on mars

or first line as an inspiring

uh notion

and so then there's always what's behind it

i have a lot of respect for elon's ability to do other things behind it

uh

and so i would take that as um symbolic

and i'd be asking him what's behind it

what's what's next

and i'm also just on the topic of deutsche coin and meme coin and

uh

there's some aspect of humor and lightheartedness

that's that's really interesting about the way we communicate what ideas become viral

how to captivate people with ideas

there's something about taking things too seriously that somehow slows it all down

and it's interesting

you're right

that's part of human nature

somehow

so

like humor is part of this whole thing

you've

uh

talked about the importance of writing ideas down

and

uh

you have principles

in particular

in principles and you have this really nice thing in your

in your book

we actually

um

i think there's such a brilliant way

okay

uh

you have such a brilliant way of highlighting which parts are extra important and you make them bold

that's a brilliant idea

but let me just ask the high-level question of what's a good system for um

taking notes

well

i find that almost everything happens over and over again

um

and we're in this

the blizzard of these things happening

and what i found is that if i'm making a decision

that that after i make the decision usually or right at the time

if i pause and reflect and i write my principle down

in other words

principle is sort of a recipe

what would i use to

how would i make that decision and what are the criteria around it

i find that i make it much more clear

it becomes clearer and it applies to the next thing that comes along

it'll be that way

because everything happens over and over and over again

and i think people make the mistake of looking at just the one like it's the first one they have

i don't know they have the first problem of this sort of the first child or whatever it is

and this has been happening plenty of times

and so

if you have the principles

i found that that helped me think more clearly about it

and it helped me communicate better like why

and so

over the years

over the last 30 years or so

that's what i've done

i did it originally to communicate very well with the people i work with

um

you know

i set up my company and and i

it was very important to have good communication

and then we could debate the principles

and so that's the process

i urge people to do that

there are many excellent decision makers

um

and i just wish that they wrote down their principles when this set

so

for example

we talked about henry kissinger and his new book is going to come out with a book on leadership

um

and don't just describe the leaders describe

then what about them

were the essential elements to make a good leader under what circumstances

and so if we think about that

when

then also

then you begin to think in a principled way and then

when you start to think in a principle way

life becomes

it's so much easier to make decisions and it's so much less confusing

because it's like coming up on a species and you say

okay

well

what species

is it not just another

it's a thing

no

what species is it

and how do i deal with that species effectively

and

and so that's what that is

and so i encourage people to write it down

i wish anybody who's successful

wrote down their principles or their recipes for making those types of decisions

so the events of interest here happens over and over and over in similar ways

as you're looking for the patterns and you're defining the process that's right to respond to those patterns

and you call that the principles and that allows you to deal with the future

effectively

so like that codifies the lessons from the past to be able to deal with the future

what advice do you have for young folks today

in high school

in college

thinking about how to live

uh

have a career they can be proud of or maybe have a life they can be proud of

know yourself

follow your passion

make your work and passion the same thing while considering the money part

because money will get you freedom and choice and be able to make that

but if you know yourself

feel the pull um and um and pursue that passion

um

and along those lines

by the way i found

um

that using personality profile tests has been very helpful

i've used those for about 25 years for people to help to understand themselves and understand each other

so i created a free one that is called principles you

it's online

it's had remarkable

loving people who've taken it

learn about themselves

but also you can put in somebody else and it'll tell you about your relationship with them

that's like 30 minutes

is a quick discovery

but the main thing is to understand on your journey

your hero's journey

when you're um

that you will have uh mistakes and you will have weaknesses and to understand those

not fight those

because by understanding mistakes

you will learn not to make mistakes again

i have a principle

which is pain

plus reflection equals progress

and so that reflection is important to know yourself

know your pulls

know your weaknesses

and when you also know your weaknesses and the strengths of other people

there are people who um

have strengths

where you're weak and you have strengths

where they're weak and to be able to work well together is the most effective way of achieving

uh

success

so yeah

it's that journey and there's a life arc

and there's a journey and you want to make it the best that you can make it

and it has

it's like a video game

you know

it has the challenges and the obstacles and the learning experiences and the temptations

and all of that and the maximizing learning to go

where you want to go to achieve the life you want is the most important

that's kind of maybe a long-winded way of suing it

but to learn

i think i'll try to say it simply

there's a five-step process

step one is

know your goals

know what you're going after

you could have almost anything you want

but you can't have everything you want

and so you have to prioritize and you move in that direction on the way to your goals

you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles

so identifying step two is understanding your problems and your obstacles

identify them

step three is to diagnose them

to get at the root cause of the problem

and that could be many root causes

but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others

but you have to be objective about them

once you diagnose them

then you go to step four

which is to design a way to get around them

and then

after you have that design

you implement that design

so you have to follow through and do it

and you do that

and and that will then produce its new results

which should be better results i have

i call this kind of the looping process

it's the evolutionary looping process

and

um

you do

you just keep doing that

and you learn over a period of time and you move in the direction that you want

last question

and you only have one minute to answer it

you dedicate the book quote to my grandchildren

and those of their generation who will be participants in the continuation of the story

# Chapter 7

then you go to step four

which is to design a way to get around them

and then

after you have that design

you implement that design

so you have to follow through and do it

and you do that

and and that will then produce its new results

which should be better results i have

i call this kind of the looping process

it's the evolutionary looping process

and

um

you do

you just keep doing that

and you learn over a period of time and you move in the direction that you want

last question

and you only have one minute to answer it

you dedicate the book quote to my grandchildren

and those of their generation who will be participants in the continuation of the story

may the force of evolution be with you

so let me ask

where is this force of evolution taking human civilization

and what in this story that evolution is writing gives you hope evolution isn't a direction toward improvement

um

and the greatest force is a man's capacity to adapt and invent

and so you see

in the charts in the book

you see that

um

this upward movement

life expectancy

um

uh

health or all the things that we think are better

you see the

there's a chart

and it shows that over a period of time and you barely see the downturns from depressions and wars

in that that is the greatest power

man's ability to invent and adapt is evolution

and that's the greatest power

and that is what gives me justifiable hope and a continuation of that

like we mentioned with elon

maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species

so not only will we keep creating amazing things here on earth

will keep expanding out into the cosmos

my time horizon isn't

doesn't have me analyzing that yet

but i

i

i hope

so

and i

uh

agree that that would mean the nature

so i'm not going to ask you for the best financial system on mars

um

i think we'll focus on earth for now

right

thank you so much for your brilliance for the

for the books you've written for the works you've done for the inspiration from of millions

so

and thank you for spending your valuable time here with me today

every time you confront something painful

you are at a potentially important juncture in your life

you have the opportunity to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion
