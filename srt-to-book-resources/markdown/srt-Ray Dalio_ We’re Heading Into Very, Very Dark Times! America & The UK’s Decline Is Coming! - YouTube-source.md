# Chapter 1

pay attention. pain plus reflection equals progress.

and from that principle, my company became the largest hedge fund in the world.

managing how much? $ 150 billion.

but i learned

that history of things

that never happened in my lifetime before were important things to understand in order to predict the future.

and we can get into that if you want. peace.

so ray dallio

is the legendary billionaire investor who decoded the cycles of human history to predict financial crashes.

build the world's largest hedge fund.

and now to warn us about what lies ahead. are you optimistic about the future of the uk?

no.

what about the united states?

no.

why?

okay.

in order to bet on what's going to happen on the global economy, i learned

that there's five big forces that create a big cycle that's repeated through history

which lasts about 80 years. the first is the money debt force that creates wealth and opportunities gaps

and it's connected to the second force, the internal conflict where you don't trust the system

causing wars between the left and the right

and it's not easy answers

like tax the rich and we can get into that.

but the third is geopolitical force. in other words, international conflict.

then there's acts of nature. and then number five is man's inventiveness particularly of new technologies.

now the question is who wins the technology war

because the winner of that determine how the new world order works.

is it something to be concerned about?

no.

the question is how you as an individual handle it.

how do i as an individual handle it?

so there's building your financial strength, flexibility, the importance of being open-minded

and how to get more out of the minute, not how to work harder.

and i really urge your audience to learn all of this.

so, first of all, i see messages all the time in the comment section

that some of you didn't realize you didn't subscribe.

so, if you could do me a favor and double check if you're a subscriber to this channel,

that would be tremendously appreciated.

it's the simple, it's the free thing

that anybody

that watches this show frequently can do to help us here to keep everything going in this show in the trajectory it's on.

so, please do double check if you've subscribed

and uh

thank you so much

because in a strange way, you are

you're part of our history

and you're on this journey with us

and i appreciate you for that.

so, yeah, thank you.

[music] ray, i i want to describe to you who's listening right now.

and the question i have for you is what is the most important thing

that this persona of person should be thinking about at the highest level right now.

so the person that's listening is someone who is intent on improving their life. they're

they're really interested in business, potentially starting their own business.

they they care about

where they're investing their their time and energy and also

where they're setting up their home based on in terms of geography.

they are aspiring to accomplish some goal. they're probably between the age of 18 and 50 predominantly

and they are very very interested in understanding what's happening in a world that feels incredibly scary, fast-paced

and uncertain at the moment.

this is a very difficult question, but if anyone i was going to ask anyone, it would have to be you.

what

what's one of the first things they should be considering at this moment to safeguard their future, their family, their finances? i don't think it's a difficult question.

i um

i think it's it's very clear. they have to understand how the life cycle works.

okay? they have to understand it how it works. we were just talking before, you know, in the book

and there was the arc of the life cycle, right?

and you have to understand that you're on an adventurous journey.

okay? and you have a certain nature.

you know, those qualities that ma make you have your preferences and so on.

and then you're going after the things that you like

and you're learning and it's going to have the ups and downs and so on

and how you approach that. so you asked

from the higher level

if i'm looking down

you know

like that life cycle

that arc

what's that journey like

how do you approach it

you know

what are your principles

how do you even learn how to approach it

that's why we're having these conversations right

y

so that's clear

you know what's your nature

how's the journey

how do you find the path that's suitable to your nature

and then you'll go down that path and you'll discover and you'll evolve.

what's that like? that's what they need to know. you said what's your nature?

what do you mean by nature?

people are born with and then also their environment creates their different nature.

you know, we have our preferences, our inclinations.

we think in a certain way.

you chose to be entrepreneurial. okay? you're living out your nature. okay? this isn't for somebody else.

you know, some people have a different nature.

okay? they would like to have the stability of a job and clarity

and so on.

so

when you have your nature, you want to know that

and then find the path that is going to be good for your nature.

then there's the particular tactical stuff.

so if you would ask me, should i be in the uk or should i be in the us?

well, that depends on a lot of things, but that's a tactical question.

so if i want to be an entrepreneur and i want to build a technology company,

do you think i should be in the uk

or the us? i think you should be in the us.

why? the us has a culture of um entrepreneurship, inventiveness.

there's a whole different culture

like in europe

generally speaking

and in and in the uk

there's an establishment culture, right? and here

um

you could be 25, have a blue streak in your hair

and have the talent, but if you got the talent to pull it off, you can get the resources

and you can be an entrepreneur.

it's there's a culture of that.

that means that it's happening more.

that's why you even see the differences in the economies.

okay, where is the inventiveness really happening? okay, it's happening here.

so i would say if you want to be an entrepreneur, this is an environment

that's particularly conducive to being an entrepreneur.

so what is your honest perspective about the uk at the moment? the uk has a financial problem. uh

the government has a debt problem

and it doesn't have enough money for what it wants to do and what it can do.

and so what you see is the nondom problem, people moving and so on so forth.

and throughout history, when you have these sorts of things, then there's great clashes in people.

okay? and the uk has been in decline since the war.

even the development of the capital markets, can you raise capital there? all of these things are much worse

than they are in the united states.

and it leads to clashes. he said, " of course,

you know,

there are five big forces that create a big cycle that lasts about 80 years, give or take 50,

let's say.

and the five big forces are

there's a money, debt, economy force, okay? debts are spending power.

so what happens is when you give somebody credit they can spend and then

but it also produces debt

and debt has to be paid back

and so what happens is if there's not enough income to pay back the debt

then you have um debt

rising relative to income

it squeezes out

spending

people don't want to hold the debt assets and so on

the uk has gone through that and has gone through that

and it's connected to the second force

and we're all going through this in varying degrees. the second force is the internal political and social force.

in other words, like between the left and the right

with wealth gaps and opportunities gaps.

we have big wealth and opportunities gaps.

so when you have big wealth and opportunities gaps, there's conflict.

okay? conflict between the left and the right.

and

when you get to the situation

where you don't believe the system is working for you

and you don't trust the system, then there are wars.

there are internal conflicts over over that

and so on. so the third force is the geopolitical

force.

in other words, u

there's a cycle that usually goes from one big war to another big war.

so the last war ended in 194544

and we began a new order in 1945.

and the way that works is that the winners of the war determine how the world order works.

they draw borders. they say here's how it's going to work. and that's the new order.

okay? and that continues until there's a rising power challenging an existing power

and the existing world order

which typically is deteriorating at that time.

and then you have international conflict. okay, these orders, there's a monetary order, they all break down.

there's an in internal political order, they all break down.

and and there's a geopolitical order.

they all have this conflict and they work together. the fourth force throughout history has been acts of nature.

droughts, floods, and pandemics, for example, have killed more people than wars.

and acts of nature, nature has a big effect.

and then number five force is man's inventiveness particularly of new technologies.

okay,

because if you see

that inventiveness

that has raised per capita incomes, gdp per capita, any measures of living standards over a period of time

and and so on.

but it is also related to the first four that i said those four four forces interact.

now when we go back to your uk case, okay, they have a financial problem.

they and almost every country now is dealing with more of that internal political problem for the same reasons.

wealth gaps, opportunities gaps,

what do we do?

who's got the power?

i don't trust the system kind of thing.

okay.

number three is we are certainly in an international great powers conflict, right?

and it certainly affects europe and the uk as we're dealing with not only the ukraine situation

but the russian situation

and what does that mean

and that relates to the money thing

because

okay

where's the money coming from to have defense or military expenditures

and so on so forth.

so that matters right

the geopolitical

matters

climate certainly matters

and then

of course technology

man's inventiveness.

so everything could be looked through at through that lens.

and so what does this mean for the uk if all other countries are going through this as well? doesn't

that just mean that all countries are going to suffer equally? no.

no.

no.

because they're not all equal.

okay.

some are more in debt than others.

okay. some people are more willing to hold their debt than others. um

some means they they have more resources. some are bigger and more powerful.

some are less powerful.

they're different. okay. they're all go in different conditions. some countries have surpluses. some countries, you know,

are not in the middle of where there's having a war.

are you optimistic about the the future of the uk at the moment?

no, no.

because it has high debt.

it has the social internal conflict.

it it's affected by the geopolitical factors.

and in terms of inventiveness, it doesn't have the culture that other countries have

like

like the us.

is that

yes.

the cult culture

and the capital markets to support

that at a scale that it needs to be supported to play seriously in the game.

and for anyone that doesn't know capital markets mean

basically the investor markets is way of saying

well

i mean it gets you the money.

in other words, you're a guy with

you know

what happens is

um

we have to enable people.

okay.

what what works is finding great people, talented people,

and identifying those who you want to bet on and enabling them.

and that works. that's the most important force, much more important than money.

okay? because you could see who's got the money and power and where did they come from?

where did nvidia come from? where did where did they all come from?

okay? there are guys like you, entrepreneur

in a sense, who's been enabled, okay, by you

because you have the talent and people want to bet on you

and that's the capital market.

so they give you money to help enable you

because they want to bet on you and then good things happen.

but are you

are you optimistic about the united states at the moment? the united states is very much a big picture.

no, i think it's very much in this issue there.

so, if i go down my list, it definitely has this uh debt money economy problem.

we can get into that. okay. it definitely has the internal conflict power

in which there's a fight between the left, you know,

the hard left and the right

due to wealth and values gaps and people not believing that the system will work for them.

and so democracy is at risk because they don't believe this.

they they're not going to follow the rules in the sense they don't believe the rules are going to

uh

number three

it's of course

the leading one side in this great power conflict of the world

right

in other words

yes

between the united states and the one side

let's say

and china and the allies

their allies on the other side.

i mean in the news

you just saw the meetings of xi putin

modi and that group over there

walking down

you know

and okay

so now it should be pretty clear how the sides are lining up

okay

you

it's always better to be in a place that's not in one of those wars

like stay out of wars

um

and of course

climate has an effect

and of course

then we have technology

the united states and china are in the big technology compet competitions.

the others are really not in the game.

they don't have the money that this innovation and talent in a sense to play at that scale

and so on.

so we have a great

you know

technology war

which can be used to create great advances but at the same time could be used for great conflicts.

and so now the question is going to be who wins the technology war

because the winner of the technology war is going to win all wars.

okay.

in other words, they'll win the economic war. they'll win the geopolitical war because technology

# Chapter 2

you

it's always better to be in a place that's not in one of those wars

like stay out of wars

um

and of course

climate has an effect

and of course

then we have technology

the united states and china are in the big technology compet competitions.

the others are really not in the game.

they don't have the money that this innovation and talent in a sense to play at that scale

and so on.

so we have a great

you know

technology war

which can be used to create great advances but at the same time could be used for great conflicts.

and so now the question is going to be who wins the technology war

because the winner of the technology war is going to win all wars.

okay.

in other words, they'll win the economic war. they'll win the geopolitical war because technology

and i'm not saying anything that hasn't repeated through history. give me that historical context if you can

just for the technology

for example

nuclear.

yeah.

nuclear won world war ii.

and and does this cycle go back further than just

oh, no.

it goes back i that book. okay.

um,

in order to understand these things, cuz i have to bet on what's going to happen.

i'm a global macro investor.

i study the last 500 years of history and and it happens over and over again in all cases.

so, i could take the british empire, i could take you through all the empires, the dutch empire before

that,

and all this, and it it it happens

uh

all the time.

i watched your

i watched your videos about this

and it was truly fascinating how predictable this stuff is

and the work that you've done to uncover this trend throughout history.

i mean, it's almost for me

it was almost irrefutable watching the evidence in in

i think it's like a 40-minute video on youtube where you show how this played out through empires.

and it begs the question, you know,

because

when you live in the united states,

when you're when you're in the present time, you almost never assume that the empire you're in could fall.

you just don't you don't see how it could happen. we're so strong. we're so great, you know,

we're so that doing ai over here, have money over here, everything's good, the sun's shining.

it's inconceivable.

of course, people always think that the future would be a slightly modified version of the present,

and it's not.

okay.

watch over decades, but it's like watching a person grow.

yeah.

okay.

yeah.

you know, you watch your kid or you watch a person at your age, any age,

and that's what you see.

yeah. okay. and you don't see the life arc. yeah. okay. but the life arc is in irrefutable.

but the u do you think it's conceivable

that in the next 50 to 100 years the us could no longer be the dominant power globally? yeah.

yeah.

more than conceivable. more than conceivable.

what does what do you mean by more than conceivable?

i mean that these evolutions always take place and they take place in a certain way

and that

um

if you look at the probabilities

um

and the paths and the symptoms

there is a challenge

the united states is facing a number of those challenges

and we're at a moment where

um

it's a question of whether the system

and the people could can get control of the situations and deal with it strongly and well

in a way

where they are not fighting to the point of damaging each other

and damaging managing the prospects for the future.

but i mean, the united states is very innovative. got all these great innovative companies here. so surely yeah.

but you you can't make generalizations about the united states.

and you can't make generalizations, by the way, about the markets either.

um

what you see is um

1

%

a small percentage

1 % of the population

if you're looking at the breakdown of incomes and also you're looking at the innovation

the stock markets

which stocks are doing well

who owns those companies and all of that

about three million people in a country of uh

330 million people are really unbelievably doing great

and you could pick the neighborhoods they're in and what they're doing.

and then there's the top 10 %, let's say, which is the people around them.

and they're really, really doing great in that world. at the same time, the bottom 60 %

60 % of americans have below a sixth grade reading level. wow. and that population

in terms of um

the basics being productive, you have to be productive and be prosperous.

so what what you need to have a su successful society is to have broadbased productivity and prosperity.

okay? and that's a problem.

okay? so, which america are you looking at? and are you watching the war that's happening between these?

it's a little bit complicated for me as a as a bit of an outsider

because i see trump saying he represents those people,

but obviously trump is a from the billionaire class himself.

so, i mean, is he is he a savior for inequality? is he correcting?

i think i think he sees a lot of the problem and he

uh

i think he sees the debt problem.

i think he sees the internal conflict disorder problem and i think he represents

uh

the red,

let's call it the red states.

i mean, you look at a map and there's red and blue and you see

where they are, okay? and he represents that

and they're united behind him in terms of doing some things.

okay? so he represents

let's call it the red side

which is located where the maps shows red

and then there are the blue

and

and he's

um

he views himself as somebody who needs to take charge and to do certain things.

others in

that population would say those who let's say are not getting are having the food stamp program cut off

or having other programs cut off that they're dependent on

would say

uh

wait a second

that's not representing me. and so we have gone

that population has gone to significant number behind him

that are devotees. they're all in.

okay. at the same time as we have the other side

which will have their devotees if you know we're in new york city.

okay.

and the up upcoming mayoral uh election will be an example of the two sides.

okay. and they will try to use the system

but there's a question

will the system have enough support to work.

okay. but that's what we have. just just to close off on this point of the uk in particular,

if if you were to try and fix it, what would you be aiming at? i say this

because we do have a millionaire exodus that's widely reported in the uk

where i think this year we're set to lose 16, 000

roughly 16, 000 millionaires.

um, when you look at the big big countries like china, america, the uae, the uk,

we're losing more millionaires than anybody else.

and i was wondering if you think it's fixable

and if you were in charge of the uk, what you might aim at first.

it's diff,

you know,

first of all,

if you go back to the basic problem, which is there's too much debt, there are deficits,

there's differences in education and opportunity levels

and so on.

the most important thing that you can have is a strong middle.

political middle.

political middle to be analytically strong

and also strong enough to get the people to do what needs to be done even if they don't want to do it to get to be productive.

now that's an easy thing to say.

it's not an easy thing to do.

but you do need that strong middle

and you do need to convey to people that you need to have the strong middle to change productivity

and you know

and are you in it?

are are you in it?

are you patriotic and in it

and you know

but you look at history

how did the united states come to be the united states? people will go to the places

that are better than them

then stay in the places that worse for them. this is fundamental

right incentives.

okay. so you have to make the place better. okay. now i would say also

you can take pockets and they go into the pocket and let it spread out.

but you also have to have this equal education or you know you've got to strive for equal opportunity.

but anyway, it's a difficult question that i'm afraid i'm incapable of um solving.

it was unnerving to hear the tone of your voice drop when i asked it. you seemed slightly

um

as if you you've kind of given up on the uk a little bit. your facial reaction? well, i'm

i'm just a

i'm just a

i'm a practical guy. i'm a realistic guy. i made my money. i'm in the business

and it's my nature to try to be realistic and to bet on how things will transpire.

and that's not healthy.

the situation in the uk is not healthy.

and the situation in the united states is very risky in many ways.

it's what we're describing. so, you know,

and then if you look where are people going

then then you see the places that have the qualities we're talking about.

they're civil.

they're creative.

the people aren't at war with each other.

what happens next in history? well, usually there's a a big fight for control, political revolutions

and things like that.

the system breaks down because they don't trust the system.

so will the legal system resolve

that? will the parliamentary system resolve that these disputes satisfactorily to the satisfaction of those people

and the other people who have different points of view

and the sides won't believe it. and this goes back

this goes back to rome. it goes back to caesar, you know,

the senate.

and you know this goes back through history all the time,

right? and in in the 30s, four major democracies chose to be autocracies.

okay,

that happened in italy, germany, spain, and japan. what's autocracy for anyone that doesn't know the word?

well, it's

it means a dictatorship essentially of a limited number of people at the top who are autocratic,

which means that they are directing things rather than a democracy

in which

um

there's representatives of all different points of view that get together and follow rules to make decisions.

so the uk could become an autocracy as could the us.

i guess

um

you're going to see a lot of pressure for that strong leader who will get control of things

and make it work well and will

and you're likely to see two different views as to which side, you know,

the red and the blue sides,

so to speak.

you're likely to see that type of clash.

you said the us is playing a risky game itself.

is that from a de debt perspective or otherwise from these things? okay.

from the debt, from the internal conflict, from the changing world order, the geopolitical world conflict,

you know,

i don't know.

we're playing with nuclear weapons and, you know,

in wars and different places

and then of course climate

and then the technology war.

how we're doing that. yeah, i saw that image the other day of putin and um

president xi and china together walking together.

if china does become the dominant force in the world, the dominant power does

is that a smooth transition?

first of all, i don't think either side is going to be the clearly dominant power for for a very long time

and

and the the quickest way to have it is some kind of a war

and that's a dangerous thing

and but maybe it evolves

hopefully

the way the soviet union evolved that the the worry of mutually assured destruction keeps everybody

not having that kind of war

and then what then then the systems

one system or another system wins

but that's an evolutionary process

and you know i can't say

and um

do you think much about time frames

because when i was watching when i was going through the changing world order

there seems to be somewhat consistent or predictable time frames when these these transitions happen.

do you think about where we are?

well, they're long-term big cycles. yeah. right. it's

it's like a life cycle

on average

they are about a life cycle about 80 years

but it's not predetermined

just like your life cycle is not predetermined like

if you take care of yourself and you

you know

i don't know

smoke

eat

well

exercise and so on

so forth

then you will probably have a longer life cycle than if you don't take care of yourself

and it's um kind of like that

you know

and so you see them

in industry

they evolve

but you can see the symptoms. okay,

you can see the actions and the symptoms

which like taking a physical

uh

then gives you a sense of where they are in their life cycles.

we're 80 years from world war ii. 80 years from world war ii.

yeah.

and you're seeing the symptoms.

yeah.

symptoms are clear.

they're all in that book.

you can see the charts of all the systems.

is it something to be worried about or concerned about if you're in the united states? no

# Chapter 3

so forth

then you will probably have a longer life cycle than if you don't take care of yourself

and it's um kind of like that

you know

and so you see them

in industry

they evolve

but you can see the symptoms. okay,

you can see the actions and the symptoms

which like taking a physical

uh

then gives you a sense of where they are in their life cycles.

we're 80 years from world war ii. 80 years from world war ii.

yeah.

and you're seeing the symptoms.

yeah.

symptoms are clear.

they're all in that book.

you can see the charts of all the systems.

is it something to be worried about or concerned about if you're in the united states? no

i mean, yes.

and then the question is how you as an individual handle it.

how do i as an individual handle it?

well, first of all, i think i think you have to be aware of the situation

and the risks for me and my family

though

in terms of risks and how i should um counteract those risks.

is it a case of me saving for a rainy day? is it a that's part of it. yeah.

um

there's a

there's a saying in hong kong

um

a chinese saying which is a smart rabbit has three holes. and what that means is you can see

is it the uk or the us

and

and i can then move to the better place and get out of the place

that's a terrible place.

so can i successfully be an immigrant or whatever and change my location? throughout history

that's been important. so the ability to go to good places and away from bad places. um

so that's part of it. um

secondly,

building your financial strength is important

which has to do with how you earn, spend and save. that will determine the amount.

and then what you do with that amount is invest.

and so how you invest

uh

is also important.

so if you have your financial ability

and you can make the move

and then you have knowledge you know about what's happening so that you can change things.

those are the things you need. so on that first point about a smart rabbit having three holes,

is it therefore a better decision at this point in time to not to not buy a house?

because a lot of people end up buying a house

and anchors them to to a place and it means that they then have to pay into a mortgage.

so a lot of lot of the financial advice most of us have growing up is

when you get enough money to buy a house, move in, pay that mortgage for 25 years.

but if i'm in a new economy, in a new world,

and flexibility and the ability to get up and go and move is there's

there's uh value to that.

the ability to move capital matters. and if you look at history, this has been an important consideration. yes.

so it matters. so if you're nailing yourself down

and that's your primary capital and it's nailed down there,

then that's does limit your flexibility.

and on the point of earning, spending, and saving, wonder what you you're a

you're a a father, aren't you? yeah.

what what advice are you giving to your children about earning money in the in the current world,

where

where they should set up their shop, the skills

that are most valuable to acquire, the technologies, the we talked about the us being a place to one of the better places to build your career for all the reasons you described.

well, that's, you know, that's kind of like the particular that you asked me for.

that's below the level of the higher level.

okay. the higher level is i have a principle. make your work and your passion the same thing.

and don't forget about the money part.

okay? if you make your work

and your passion the same thing so that you're really enjoying your work, you'll have an enjoyable satisfactory life

and you'll probably be better at your career

that

um

as a result

probably advance

and so on. so you have a happier life and you will have a more

probably a more successful life.

but it is true that the careers that you choose will have financial implications. mhm.

and if you say, " i want to be a poet or something along those lines.

" you better consider the financial implications of that.

that doesn't mean that you have to go make a ton of money

because i think that that's

i think a lot of people fall into that trap that they think the money is

um

like vast amounts of money is vast amounts of success.

and that's not true. in other words, is your work and your passion the same thing?

so, i think that what brings people happiness is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

okay? if you have meaningful work, you know, that you're into

and your, you know, your passion and your work's the same thing.

and you have meaningful relationships, whether through that work or beyond, you're going to have probably a great life.

okay? and so, you have to keep that in mind.

and it doesn't have much correlation past a certain level of money.

uh

it doesn't have much correlation with um

that well-being with the amount of money you have.

and if you see studies across societies

and you'll see that past that certain basic level, there's no correlation between the amount of money they have

and how much happiness they have or well-being.

okay? that the highest level of co correlation across societies and studies of happiness and well-being is community.

do you have a sense of community? do you have those around you

who are your community?

you'll live longer that way. you'll have a more joyous life and it'll be a better outcome.

but anyway, so thinking about those things i think is important

based on your life cycle

in this book principles your guided journey.

create your own principles to get the work and life you want.

do you think you have to play different games in different seasons of your life cycle as it relates to generating wealth?

and what i'm talking about here is really like risk profile

um

or what i should be optimizing for.

should i be

should i be trying to hang around with ray dalio

or should i be focusing on the job that pays me the most?

first of all,

the answer is yes.

and the second question you asked

the answer is um

that you should be around the the people who are the best people to teach you to operate

by the

the mentors and the learnings

and so on. you should be around the best people

and when i say best people

i mean people of good character and good capabilities. okay. and uh

so you should be around the best

not the job that pays you the most.

and i could explain why that is,

but and yes,

in terms of that arc, you will play it differently at different parts of your life cycle.

so in the early part of your life cycle,

what you're going to do is

i mean the more learning and experiencing is the most important thing that you can do in the learning

in the early part of your life cycle.

it's like you're going to make your choices.

what direction am i going to be in and so on so forth. so learn.

okay, that that's that's most important.

and then what you're at the end of your life cycle, you're pretty much relieved from all of that.

you're not going to be working to earn, okay? you're going to be free of all of that.

you're going to have um

and you have freedom of choices

and so on.

and you're going to be thinking about transitioning.

how do i transition well-being or how do i transition my wealth

or how do i transition and so on

you know

that's

that's where you are still learning is a joy

but at the same time

in terms of trying to accomplish

it's not the same at your late part of your life cycle

as it is in your early part of your life cycle

so i want to ask about your early life cycle

and what the most important strategic or wealth generating decisions you made that you would encourage

encourage everybody to consider if their nature is aligned to yours. okay. my nature was

i hated school.

i didn't like the whole thing of remembering this and remembering this and then give it back to me

and there were these uh you know history

like there's william the conquer in 1066 and what did he do

and you know

like all of that was what education represented.

and when i was um 12, a kid, i earned money with odd jobs like

um

i had a paper route and um

i mowed lawns and i caddied and i took my cadding money

and when i was 12

i got

everybody was talking about the stock market.

so i put some money in the stock market. i didn't know what i was doing, of course,

but i

um

i picked um

the stock

that was the only stock i ever heard of that was selling for less than $ 5 a share.

and my reasoning was i could buy more shares, so if it went up, i could make more money.

okay, that was a stupid criteria, but it was a company that was about to go bankrupt.

and another company acquired it and it tripled in price.

and i said, " i like this game. " [music] so, i got

i got hooked on the game.

i'm still hooked on the game, right? so, i liked it.

okay. that that affected me. so, i barely got into uh cw post college and then i went to

uh

harvard business school

and that opened my eyes to the world in in many ways

because of who were there and what it was like and all that, you know,

the best and the brightest kind of thing.

but i always still traded markets because i always played the game.

i could tell you stories. you want a couple of quick stories? 100

%.

okay.

so, i'm clerking on the floor of the new york stock exchange between graduating from college

and in the summer

between graduating from college and going to uh harvard business school. and that is 197

the summer of 1971.

mhm.

and on august 15th, 1971, richard nixon gets on the television

and says

that, you know, the promise that that you were going to be able to take your paper money

and go get gold,

you can't do that and we're not

we're going to cut off that off.

he didn't say it in exactly those words, but money then was gold

and what we think of as paper money, fiat money was claims on the gold.

so i walked on the floor of the new york stock exchange that summer

and i thought the market was going to go down a lot

and the market went up a lot and i didn't understand why

because i never went through a devaluation before.

and i studied history

and i found that in march of 1933, roosevelt got on the radio

and made the exact same announcement that you're not going to get your gold

and they're going to print the money.

and when you print a lot of money, you have that.

okay.

so, i learned that history of things that never happened in my lifetime before were important things to understand.

okay.

i went back then to harvard business school two for two years

and and two years later as a result of all the printing of money and the oil shock

because of all of that

uh

we had the in 1973 oil shock

and now because of my background

i'm head hired to be director of commodities at a wall street brokerage firm.

okay.

mhm.

which

and then all sorts of things happened. um

turbulence

and so on

so forth.

that firm went broke. i went to another firm and i was

uh

rowdy.

i wasn't your typical good employee,

you know,

follow everything.

and

uh

so i got fired and that was in uh

1975

and then

i

but

uh

clients all liked me and for things

and so they would pay me for advice

and i continued to trade the markets and that's

when i formed bridgewwater. okay. and what that was 1975.

i just passed along bridgewater 50 years later.

yeah. okay. so there's a journey there that has failures and successes and learnings.

you know, i have a principle. pain plus reflection equals progress.

okay? your best learnings come from the pain.

it's a message. pay attention. learn how reality works and how to deal with it differently

so you have principles for re dealing with reality better.

and i learned that process.

and from that process, my company bridgewwater became the largest hedge fund in the world.

um, extremely successful, managing how much? $ 150 billion.

1, 500 people, $ 150 billion.

and that's made you a very wealthy man.

and made me a very wealthy man, which by the way was not my intention.

okay.

i just wanted to play the game and to have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.

that was paramount.

but it happened to be the game i played.

if you're good at the game, you make a lot of money.

and now i'm at a stage in my life where i'm

i want to pass things along.

i need to pass things along, right? so, hence the books, hence our conversation

and here we are.

that's the life arc.

but i learned a lot. and so that's the journey.

i think b2b marketeers keep making this mistake.

they're chasing volume instead of quality.

and

when you try to be seen

by more people instead of the right people, all you're doing is making noise.

but that noise rarely shifts the needle.

and it's often quite expensive.

and i know as there was a time in my career where i kept making this mistake

that many of you will be making it, too.

eventually, i started posting ads on our show sponsors platform, linkedin.

and that's when things started to change.

i put that change down to a few critical things.

one of them being that linkedin was then and still is today the platform

where decision makers go to not only to think and learn but also to buy.

and

when you market your business there, you're putting it right in front of people who actually have the power to say yes.

and you can target them by job title, industry, and company size.

it's simply a sharper way to spend your marketing budget.

and if you haven't tried it, how about this? give linkedin ads a try.

and i'm going to give you a $ 100 ad credit to get you started.

if you visit linkedin. com / diary,

you can claim that right now. that's linkedin. com / diary.

just for context, people don't like talking about money

and i understand it, but you're a prolific philanthropist.

also, google says that your net worth is in the tens of billions of dollars.

# Chapter 4

but that noise rarely shifts the needle.

and it's often quite expensive.

and i know as there was a time in my career where i kept making this mistake

that many of you will be making it, too.

eventually, i started posting ads on our show sponsors platform, linkedin.

and that's when things started to change.

i put that change down to a few critical things.

one of them being that linkedin was then and still is today the platform

where decision makers go to not only to think and learn but also to buy.

and

when you market your business there, you're putting it right in front of people who actually have the power to say yes.

and you can target them by job title, industry, and company size.

it's simply a sharper way to spend your marketing budget.

and if you haven't tried it, how about this? give linkedin ads a try.

and i'm going to give you a $ 100 ad credit to get you started.

if you visit linkedin. com / diary,

you can claim that right now. that's linkedin. com / diary.

just for context, people don't like talking about money

and i understand it, but you're a prolific philanthropist.

also, google says that your net worth is in the tens of billions of dollars.

and i'm sure there's some people that have clicked on this conversation

and aren't aware of the scale of wealth you built up

and the scale of bridgewater capital and how prolific and famous it is in the investing world.

in that 50-year life arc, one of the things you mentioned is pain. all of us will encounter pain.

and you said pain plus reflection.

reflection equals progress.

how have you leared to deal with pain? you've had a lot of pain in all facets of life

because you've lived the life arc

um

and you continue to. how

what's the best principle for dealing with pain? first of all,

um to calm yourself down and to get centered.

meditation has had a big beneficial effect on my life.

we can get into meditation in a minute of how it has.

but the ability to, you know, in a sense calm yourself down and

when the time is right to reflect on what's happened

both to understand how reality works.

you know, you want to be a hyper realist.

i understand how reality works.

therefore, i need to do this under this set of circumstances, which means developing principles.

and so what i did when i would do that anytime

whenever i would think

what

what should i do

whether painful or not

i would pause

reflect on

you know what should i do if that happened again

and that's how i would write down my principles

and what i did was

i wrote down a lot of principles

a lot of principles

a lot of principles

if this happens

that happens

and whatever

and then so i wrote these principles down and then i found that in investing

um

if i can computerize those decision rules

i could back test them

see how they would have worked

and so on.

so i built systems, decision-making systems. um,

computer would make decisions.

so it was ai before llms, but it was ai to have decision-making criteria.

so it would be like i i would make a computer chess game

that would play while i was playing my mental chess game, what moves we would make.

and it's completely automated and so on.

but i'm what i'm trying to say is that reflecting on how does reality really work

and what do i do when this happens to

that happens is the development of principles

and that has been invaluable

and it also makes me see things differently

because a lot of people

um

and if i didn't do this

i would be seeing almost as uh

a blizzard of things coming at me

instead

i see everything as another one of those. so let let's say

for example

it

it's a species. so it's like seeing okay

that's what kind of species is it

and how do i deal with

that species? so it's one of those rather than just a lot of things coming at me.

pattern recognition of yeah.

but but let's say if you think of a

it's a duck.

okay. okay. oh okay. it's a duck. how do i deal with a duck? or it's a lion.

okay, how do i deal with a lion? rather than just a lot of things coming at it.

so this principle thinking

and seeing it that way had a big effect on the quality of my decision making

and and that helped. two questions i had there is to become a principal thinker

i need to do more reflection, right? and then the other

think about how does

how does the machine

how does

how does life

how do these things work?

so that's what i mean. okay. and to write that down.

uh

yeah.

yeah.

write down your thoughts. i find sometimes what i would do is i'd uh

dictate them into my iphone. okay. okay. i'd say no.

okay. ah

this is how when you're making a decision. why did you make that decision?

so, not just make a decision, but think about the criteria you're using to make the decision

also my emotions, my trauma, my insecurities, my anxiety,

right? and and you might say when reflecting on that, is that helpful? is that harmful?

and what do i do about that?

like

for example

when what you're referring to is

yes

the

um

that the motions and the things and all of those

um

we

uh

you have to understand that that

basically the brain's got two parts to it

right

it has the logical part of your brain

reasonable

tries to reason things through

and then which is conscious

and then it has the subconscious mind

which is the subliminal

that is really driving you

and so

when you can reflect

okay

how are my emotions entering into it

what do i

you know

and so on

and you can think and you can align

that

that's very powerful

and meditation by the way

naturally does that

because what you do when you meditate and maybe a times come

i should explain meditation

okay

how it works

um

what you do is it's a process process by which you sit quietly and you repeat in your mind

what is called a mantra

which is a sound

that it's a word that has no meaning.

let me say

the most classic example of that would be okay. so you're quietly there and you go with your breath

you go

you know [music] like that

but you need to be taught

but anyway

i

um

and so when you're doing that

uh

because your m is in your mind or your mantra is in your mind

you're not able to have other thoughts.

you'll see yourself wavering between doing that and staying on the mantra and then having thoughts.

um

but what

and then you go back to your mantra. when you are

uh

in the mantra

a a lot

then it disappears. the sound disappears and you go into your subconscious mind. that's what they call transcending.

transcendental meditation is the type of meditation i do.

and so you go there

and you're not in a conscious state and you're not in a subcon unconscious state.

you're in a conscious state. so it's subconscious state. it's not unconscious

is you're sleeping.

conscious is that you're awake like we are.

you're in this.

so it's a different state.

like if you hear that noise, you would hear that noise.

it would be big. not when you're sleeping. but when you're in your subconscious state, then it's relaxing. uh

it's helpful

and this process helps to

um

bring your conscious state and your uncon subconscious state into alignment.

in other words, you recognize both

and it calms you down. it

it's like the ninja in the ninja movies, you know,

they're fighting

but they

it seems in slow motion.

the camera shows them in slow motion and they're doing whatever they're doing along that.

it kind of makes you in

that kind of state of mind so that you're dealing with what's coming at you in that way.

and so what you referred to is this

um

these things that happen and how you deal with those is really important to the quality of your decision-making.

how influential was transcendental meditation in your success?

oh, enormously successful. enormously significant. ve

very

very significant.

in other words, that way of singing seeing things and how often

and and by the way, there's

you know

there's

i

i would say say there's a serenity prayer. the serenity prayer is god

give me the serenity to accept that which i can't control

and give me the power to control that which i can and the wisdom to tell the difference.

okay. and so to how you approach these things, we're talking about reflection. you ask me reflection.

okay? if you can reflect in that quality way, then you deal with anything.

and i've

i've dealt with

uh

the worst possible thing.

um

i lost a son.

okay? and i would have rather died.

i would have rather lost everything to lose my son.

so it's the worst possible thing. and and then to see what it did

you know

the damage and the harm from family terrible.

okay. then to go through that with meditation with reflection and so on

uh

was invaluable and people have their own challenges

but to be able to do it that way

i i really urge your audience

i urge you to

uh

to learn that

that's very helpful. how

how did that tragedy change your your perspective and your your principles

in any way

on life on

on happiness

on success

on all these things that you've written about? well,

it's again

i

you know

i go above it

and

um

you reflect on the life arc

and i realize at that higher level that that's what the life arc is like.

you

you'll in in all my books there's this ar

um

arcing

this arcing

here's a bigger version of it

uh

yeah

there's this arcing

okay

i don't know if you're camera sees that

okay

whatever it is

and that's what life and evolution is like to me

meaning you make advances

you will have setbacks

okay

if you reflect well,

and you learn how reality works

and how you will deal with it, you will get past that and go on.

and that's just what it is. that's just the way life is. and if you do that

well, then that's your best possible life.

are you religious? are you a religious person? i'm not religious, but i'm spiritual. okay. the dalai lama

who i had the pleasure of meeting told me u and i i agree with

um

that religions are typically

um

a mix between superstitions and spirituality.

there's half of it is that element that nobody knows

but there is the way people should deal with each other. there is karma.

okay. all religions

there's the part of them that says do unto others as you would have them do unto you

or what goes around comes around and then you get to the particulars.

okay. and it is true that if we work well together

that even little things i can do to help you can make a big difference in your life

and little things that you can do to help me make a big difference in our lives.

and so it's practical and it is also joyous.

okay, that creates a relationship.

and we talked earlier about how that meaningful relationship is like the source of great happiness.

but when you have a community and you do that, you have a better society.

and almost all religions will tell you that there'll be elements of those.

and when i believe in spirituality, what i also mean is

uh

we're all part of this greater hole.

okay? we're all part of the greater hole.

and if you could see yourself as part of the greater whole and love the greater whole

uh

and whatever that is

spirituality

really

okay

and so i will go through my life arc

okay

and i will die and i'm comfortable with that

okay in that

okay

it's all part of the greater whole

you know

na nature and whatever it is

that's true

i can't tell you about other things

but i do believe in the things i just told you when it comes to living a successful life

we've talked about having dreams

and understanding your nature and aspiring for things and then understanding reality

which transcendental meditation is a great mechanism and vehicle to do

um

and in your

in your book about a successful life

you talk about

plus determination

plus determination

hard work

if i want to be a successful man

or woman, how important do you think hard work is? well, gives you power.

it's very important, right? some people

some people,

you know,

i'm not saying they want to choose it, but the ir

the irony of things is there are first order consequences and there are second order consequences.

this is like a rule of life, okay? and most of the time

the first order consequences

whether they're likable or not

has the opposite second quarter

second order consequences.

what i mean by that is like eating or exercising.

okay, eat the foods you like. second order consequence is probably not going to be good.

um

you know i don't want to exercise

um

second order consequences won't be as good. okay. working hard

which gives you strength.

where does strength come from?

i mean strength comes from working hard.

so working hard will will give you power.

power will make things easier and make things better.

that's just the way it is.

and being open-minded while you do it. something that was openminded to you. yeah.

i say

uh

the importance of being open-minded and assertive at the same time.

um

i

i

i watch people becoming so tied to their own opinions

# Chapter 5

what i mean by that is like eating or exercising.

okay, eat the foods you like. second order consequence is probably not going to be good.

um

you know i don't want to exercise

um

second order consequences won't be as good. okay. working hard

which gives you strength.

where does strength come from?

i mean strength comes from working hard.

so working hard will will give you power.

power will make things easier and make things better.

that's just the way it is.

and being open-minded while you do it. something that was openminded to you. yeah.

i say

uh

the importance of being open-minded and assertive at the same time.

um

i

i

i watch people becoming so tied to their own opinions

like this is the greatest tragedy of mankind. the greatest transgen of mankind

because it so easily can be fixed

is holding a strong opinion that is wrong

that you could have made right better if you were open to learning more.

if you would said, " i want to be stress tested.

i want my thinking to be stress tested. i want to make sure that i'm making the better decision

and so i'll be challenged.

but a lot of people view that challenging like a fight. it's not a fight.

if somebody holds a different opinion, it should prompt a curiosity.

you know, i don't know.

am i wrong

or is they wrong?

there's a 50 % chance.

i don't know.

maybe i'm wrong.

so, it should prompt curiosity

and in exchange to try to make sure that you're seeing the whole picture and so on.

but subliminal instincts are i'm going to stick with it and i'm going to have a fight.

that's a problem

because there's too much on the line for so many people to

it's subliminal.

it's

it's

it just goes back to the mind thinking that the intellectual challenge is a fight and it's egotistical.

you know,

ego,

i must be right.

as an as an investor and entrepreneur, that's obviously particularly important

because you're constantly dealing with your information and feedback, which you need to be flexible.

that was one of the two things that changed my

uh

my

my

my whole direction and made me successful. i i can explain it if you want.

please. 19

79

and 80

i had calculated

that american banks had lent more money to foreign countries

that they were going to be able to pay back

and that we were going to have a debt crisis.

very controversial point of view.

in august of 1982, mexico defaulted on its debts

and over the next decade, many other countries did and it caused bank problems.

however, at that time, i thought things were going to get bad

and that was the exact bottom in the stock market, august 1982.

so, i couldn't have been more wrong.

i lost money for me.

i lost money for the clients.

i lost money.

i was so broke

that i had to borrow $ 4, 000 from my dad to help to pay for family bills

because i was faced with the choice.

what am i going to do?

and and do i do

i go back to work on wall street, get a uh tie, get on the train,

and go back that

which is again not in my nature or whatever.

and and two things changed me. okay, reflection.

first of all,

um,

i learned what we were just talking about.

i learned humility and fear of being wrong and open-mindedness.

so, i wanted the smartest people who could i could find to stress test my opinions

because i'm always realized i could be wrong.

and then i learned how to diversify my bets so

that i could dramatically reduce my risk without reducing my returns.

okay, that was the bottom.

okay,

from that point all the way over that

following those principles took me to the biggest hedge fund in the world, the most successful

and so on

because i applied it to the markets, applied it to what we did

and so on. so that notion of reflection

and then how do you deal with what reality is like

and then you know

okay

the learn

learn

radical open-mindedness in other words

and like there's a principle in the book you have to take in before you put out or that

um

decision making is a two-step process

first take in then decide.

okay. so, yes, open-mindedness. you don't doesn't in any way minimize your ability to decide.

so, you still have the freedom to decide, but it's crazy not to be open-minded.

you recognize that the biggest threat to good decision-m is harmful emotions.

and that two-step process is first learn and then make the decision.

which is funny

because it sounds simple, but

when you said it, i think about all the worst decisions i've ever made in business.

and i missed step one. i forgot

to

i forgot to take a minute and do the evidence gathering or the like information gathering process.

yeah, just smart people who care about your decision

say

stress test me.

why don't we do that? that ego and also instinct that that's a fight.

is there any advice you would give me on becoming a better decision maker? so i have a fund, i have many businesses.

is there any sort of practical simple foundations of becoming a better decision maker

that we haven't talked about? get smart people to interrogate my thinking.

um, be open-minded. i think we've talked about almost all of them. um,

i think then you have to then know about how to leverage yourself. okay.

in other words, as you do more and more, uh,

how do you do more and more when your brain has a capacity limit, okay,

and there's only certain number of hours in the day or the week,

okay, you have to know how to do that. is that focus

or is that something?

no, no,

no.

it's knowing how to do it through others. okay. it's knowing how to pick others and orchestrate.

well, it's like

uh

running a symphony or whatever.

okay. get the best players. okay, when i say

uh

you know

um

good character and good capabilities and orchestrate them well and then provide that

um

that leverage

like

uh

um

when i was doing the most

i had 30 direct reports

whatever the number is.

so

uh

it

the process is how to get more out of a minute

or a day, not how to work harder, okay? it's how to leverage yourself.

and you're going to leverage yourself by picking the right people who you can trust.

they're not going to screw you.

they're going to operate in your interest and they're going to be capable.

and so a lot of people what you can do is you can deal with them

and then you can say

like i i would deal with them on this 30 reports.

i'd have maybe um an hour meeting with them once every two weeks

and and they go off and do things. and when you do that

you can even find people who are much better at things than you would be if you did them.

because if you have these different things, okay, you better

because otherwise you don't have the capacity.

you have these two key challenges to to overcome as an entrepreneur, which is find these great capable people

that have great character

and then

like

bind them with the right culture to make sure that they do the best work, right?

and and in other words, it's meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical truthfulness and radical transparency.

radical truthfulness and transparency.

okay.

first, if you can have um meaningful work and meaningful relationships, the people are on the mission with you.

wow, that's fantastic.

but you

you better be truthful and transparent. that'll show that you're honest and you better

because you have to get a truth

including what people are bad at and how to deal with all those things

and

and most people hide them. they don't bring them out into the open. okay,

they

everybody's worried about hurting each other's feelings

or you know

uh

that

and then

so they're not honest with each other and and they're

that's the barrier

you

we talked about

the barrier of disagreement

there's

it's like that

okay

um

you know

uh

i don't know

are you good at that

or you're striking out

if you're striking out and what is it

how do we deal with it

you better talk about that clearly

because you need to have an a team of players

you know you have to work yourself

so your team is an a team of players who are tight.

how did you do that at bridgewater?

how did you make people honest? oh, well

uh

f

first of all

um

i had a policy talk behind another person's back

um

critically.

that happens three times, you're out.

and then i would have radical transparency so everybody could see everything.

so you could see why i'm making decisions and i would reflect.

but the main thing is you know you know if it's happening or not.

okay.

and i made that comfortable because that's ordinarily uncomfortable.

we talked about the fact that there's an intellectual you and there's an emotional subliminal you.

okay. i made them understand like if i had a team

a football team and so on that this is going to be better for the team.

is going to be better for you and you'll have your evolution

because what do you want to have dishonesty?

do you want people to think one thing about you

and really say something different? how is that going to work?

so there's an intellectual

okay

we believe it

and then also by having the meaningful relationships. i mean i'm not

i don't force them.

i create a culture of meaningful relationships so that they have known each other for a long time.

they go go to each other's parties or they go to each other's there are funerals.

there are baby showers. there are these things. not that anybody's f

i created uh clubs. i said, " any club that you want to create that has more than uh

20 people

um

whatever it is

up to $ 500 per half. " so, so i don't care what it is.

if it's play softball

or play chess

or whatever it is that you're enjoying each other's company

or you want to go to ball games or something, i don't care what it is.

i'll pay for half up to that

up to $ 500.

so i to nobody has obligations to or something

but if i have that kind of meaningful relationships

so you can talk honestly with each other

uh

i found that very helpful and you've built a famously built an idea

meritocracy

which in my understanding means where the best idea ends up winning in the company versus just your idea

because you're the most powerful person in the business

right

i mean i want what do i want

i want the best idea to win

this sounds simple

but but again

it's

it's not how businesses operate.

one of the fascinations i've always had is that

when businesses get bigger and they have more intellectual horsepower by

i mean if you just added up how many brains they had

they sometimes get less innovative

and it it feels like the the ceo well

because they become more more bureaucratic and more fragmented. yeah. okay. there's

um

i found it to be true

and it's wellestablished fact that if you get a group of people past a certain size

which is 75 to 100 people

um

they don't know each other. okay,

they

they

they start to become different

and then you lose those relationships. you lose a lot and so on.

i found it because

uh

um

at the holiday season every year,

what i would do is i would write everybody notes, long notes in their cards

and i would pick an individualized holiday gift for them.

and when it got to be to 67 people, i remember the year, it broke my back.

i mean, i i just couldn't do it. okay.

and i realized that at that point i was going into another frame.

okay. and so it's a organizational reality that you can keep that group

and then what you have to do is then you have different

those different areas and you have to create cohesiveness between those different and cohesiveness

common mission

and how do you do that between that. so, like

for example,

when we would have our holiday party where it used to be

everybody would be, you know, sort of go in and you have a holiday party and everybody together,

what i found out is we had a big arena that we would uh

go to and i'd have both. i'd have okay

um

that department is in that area and whatever

and then they come out and they all mingle together and so on.

so there's an organizational thing that you've got to realize in terms of culture and and management of that.

it's like villages in a city

i guess

like

yeah

you basically keep build the villages and then good example city. interesting.

okay. yeah.

our media company's at that exact point now. it's at

it's at that

90

90 odd people. okay. there you are.

so when you said 75 to 100

i was like ah

interesting.

yeah.

i was thinking about all the things i should be doing now to counteract some of those adverse effects of the culture splintering

or relationships breaking down.

but i guess you've described it there. uh

interesting.

and i have to say one of the things i found to be most

i'm 33 years old. i just turned 33 last week.

it's crazy how how often people say that hiring is the most important thing.

yet

when you look at how what entrepreneurs are spending their time on, it's usually like the product, the marketing, etc.

and it's maybe like one or two hours in some cases if they're lucky on finding truly exceptional people.

they often just outsource it to someone else, the recruitment team.

when you think back through your career, how important was it to find truly exceptional people? of course.

well, i systemized it first of all.

um

i think that anything i do or one does can be systemized.

so i would think what are the personalities, what are the backgrounds of the people

that i'm hiring, what are the choices,

how do i specify it? and i've and i got it

by also maintaining a lot of data with people.

there's um

there's a ted talk i did that

uh

explains how like data

uh

everybody's going around and they're operating in a certain way.

so i know what people are like.

# Chapter 6

it's crazy how how often people say that hiring is the most important thing.

yet

when you look at how what entrepreneurs are spending their time on, it's usually like the product, the marketing, etc.

and it's maybe like one or two hours in some cases if they're lucky on finding truly exceptional people.

they often just outsource it to someone else, the recruitment team.

when you think back through your career, how important was it to find truly exceptional people? of course.

well, i systemized it first of all.

um

i think that anything i do or one does can be systemized.

so i would think what are the personalities, what are the backgrounds of the people

that i'm hiring, what are the choices,

how do i specify it? and i've and i got it

by also maintaining a lot of data with people.

there's um

there's a ted talk i did that

uh

explains how like data

uh

everybody's going around and they're operating in a certain way.

so i know what people are like.

if you know what people are like, you know what you can expect of them.

and then i would then say uh

in a very data way,

those people who are successful in these jobs have the following attributes

that would create a job specifications for that type of job.

so i i knew

that in that type of job there would be that type of person i'm looking for.

okay.

what works

they work

okay

data

and then i would find that would be my job spec

and and so we had the systems

and then we had some people who are responsible for doing that

because you're right

it takes time

how can i interview all those people and so on

but who can you trust and you're operating that way

and then evaluation process doesn't stop when you hire them

okay

the valuation process continues from that moment

and you still learn more about what they're like and you do that same process and still think

would

i still have hired them and and if i wouldn't have hired them

you know

in the first place

then they shouldn't be there

and so i have a process and people

people in process

do people change after a certain point

so if you've hired someone in six months and 12 months and they haven't changed

is it worth giving them another year

is it worth a performance review

i found out that for me the big question

mostly there were two big questions

but um

the big question is how do you adapt to my culture

and that would take about 18 months to find out like

can you speak honestly about what can we have thoughtful disagreement

do you like this evolutionary process where you're challenged and all of this kind of thing

that culture that'take about 18 months and then roughly speaking

then learning about the people

their strengths and weaknesses would take 18 months

two

two years

maybe something along those lines

and so then you know

you could pretty much decide

but always being open every day by day

so nobody's surprised that you're always talking about things

you know

how's it going

make sure you keep what i'm about to say to yourself

i'm inviting 10, 000 of you to come even deeper into the diary of a ceo.

welcome to my inner circle.

this is a brand new private community that i'm launching to the world.

we have so many incredible things that happen that you are never shown.

we have the briefs that are on my ipad when i'm recording the conversation.

we have clips we've never released. we have behind the scenes conversations with the guest

and also the episodes that we've never ever released

and so much more.

in the circle, you'll have direct access to me.

you can tell us what you want this show to be, who you want us to interview,

and the types of conversations you would love us to have.

but remember, for now, we're only inviting the first 10, 000 people that join before it closes.

so, if you want to join our private closed community, head to the link in the description below

or go to daccircle.

com.

it's a really interesting time to be leading a business.

new skills are constantly being invented

and ones that didn't exist a few months ago are now all of a sudden essential.

our team at flight story thrives on staying ahead of emerging tech and innovation.

so whenever we need to plug into those skills of the future like vibe coding, ai agent development, generative engine optimization, all of the technical things we've talked about on the show before, we always go to the same place, which is fiverr,

our show sponsor, and the place

where that future focused talent quietly shows up before the rest of the world catches on.

their freelancers are reliable, high performing, and also highly vetted.

and you'll find them in over 750 categories.

fiverr isn't just for quick jobs.

we use their talent more on complex long-term projects, ones that require an expert to take charge.

and you can tap into tomorrow's talent at fiverr. com / diary.

and for 10 % off your first order, use code diary.

ai is

um

a bit of an alien that seems to have entered the room um

and has is going to change more

almost every every industry. great.

yeah.

i can't tell if you're being sarcastic. no.

truly,

if you are

um

working with it, controlling it, if it's a good partner to be able to get a lot of leverage, it's truly fantastic.

as i said in almost everything i did, we had the criteria, we had the systemized.

would you do that? would you not do that? how do you know

how does reality work? what are the principles? and and so it's a fantastic leveraging

like i described. you know, i would make the decision-making model

like the computer chess game that would make it. well, now it's better than uh

ever those those resources.

so it leverages you enormously. what about having a strong middle?

we talked about having the strong sort of economic political middle.

political middle. yeah. yeah. is it going to drive inequality? yes.

it's going

that's like all good

like all things. going to be

um

it has good things and bad things and we were talking

let's say first about managing and doing that

i think in managing and knowing what people are like and how they're all

it's going to be very valuable

mostly very valuable in terms of changing

um

there'll be

uh

a limited number of winners and a bunch of losers and

um

i think it's going to create much greater polarity

which

as we're seeing um through the system

the ways that we talked about

you know that top 1 to 10 % benefiting a lot and that you know

so that will be a dividing

uh force

i think it's got to got to pose the question with robotics accelerating at the speed of of light

with optimist and tesla

and all the things they're doing

and all these other companies

humanoid robots

and then with artificial intelligence

having trillions of dollars plowed into it and accelerating. we're in this crazy boom at the moment.

with these two things combining, you're going to be able to have a humanoid robot who

that can navigate human spaces, but is also smarter than i am.

lawyers, accountants,

uh

lots of people in the medical profession. why would you

why would one need them if we had a humanoid robot that is smarter than all of us

and has a phd and everything?

well, we will not need a lot of those jobs for the reasons that you're saying.

okay. and then the question is what our society does

and what do you think we do in such a world? i think we fight over about what we do unfortunately.

um

but as i say i i don't think we have escaped a world

where most people to have a healthy society

most people have to be productive and prosperous. i don't

i

i think people need to be now

certainly there

and there certainly needs to be a redistribution policy.

i don't think that's just a redistribution of money policy

because uselessness and money may not be a great combination.

so i think that you have that has to be figured out

and the question is whether we're too fragmented to figure that out and agree on it

and i'm worried about that.

interesting times. is there any historical precedence for this in your view? someone that knows history.

is there any historical precedence for something like ai and robotics converging?

well,

um

through um evolution, we have gone from a period of time

which was called the dark ages or the agricultural age

in which

um

basically there was land.

it's agricultural and so on

and people were treated

they were essentially like oxen

most people

and then there were the landowners

who were the nobles

and then there were the royalty

who

uh

were the families that control most things

and so on

and then in history

with the uh invention of the printing press

there became more knowledge

um

uh

more intelligence

and we see an evolution in which

um

you start to see new ages emerge and thinking emerge and power change

and i won't take you through the whole history

but you start to see that individuals can be clever enough to earn money

that

so you begin the age of exploration and the industrial revolutions in which machines replaced people

and it's almost like they first replaced them physically

that

um

in other words they didn't have

they were not like oxen doing the thing

so you get a tractor or something

and and it's almost like from the body up in terms of the mind

and so you've seen that evolution through time and the rise of intelligence in its various forms

go through this arc of rising in intelligence

and now you see that intelligence matters more than anything.

okay? it matters more than money.

it matters more than anything

because intelligence will attract people among those with money to invest in them in the development of that.

and so we have seen this arc through history develop in that way, right? and we've seen people replaced.

now the question is as we get higher

and higher in thinking, okay, whether we've run out of capacity to shift

or whether we're just going to be totally replaced. our muscles have been totally replaced, but okay,

as this is happening, our best thinking may be totally replaced

and we're going to have to deal with that question.

are you hopeful? i'm excited.

i'm

i think it all comes down to human nature.

okay.

i'm excited in that. fast forward, make the most of it, jump on it.

woo

!

you know,

i'm excited.

i've also watched

uh

the evolution of species.

almost all species have come

and gone for certain reasons

and they uh one of the reasons that they come have come and gone is

because almost their strengths are not in all respects

great strengths.

you can use these things, intelligence to your detriment.

and i believe that

um

the things that these technologies and so on bring us while very important,

it extends life expectancy

and all of that is not import as important as human nature.

and so if you were to go back in time

and we're at different societies, do you have happier societies? is the well-being greater? okay.

so you can go 50 years ago and you might say the well-being is greater

50 years ago.

not in all ways, not in in many ways

the technologies and the consequences of those are much better, but you may have had a better life.

and it's human nature of how people are going to deal with each other.

so i think the real question is can people rise above this

and

and which it goes back to the spirituality question.

can people then rise above it so that they think of the collective good and they think of you

know

collectively

how do we make the best and also karma

you know

in other words

um

the realization

that if i help you in ways

that can be so simple for me to help you make such a big difference in your life

and you do the same and we have win-win relationships

it'll be good

but if we don't do that

and i worry about human nature

and i worry about this process, especially when you've got geopolitical tensions. and it's because of human nature.

i've had a lot of conversations on the podcast about ai

and i just can't seem to get to my own solid conclusion about this

because when i look at human nature, as you say,

i see greed, i see power, hunger, status.

yeah.

some problems

you just just accept the fact

that you may not be able to be confident about a prediction in the future.

so, it'll always be a question

and just get on with the fact of using it for yourself in the best way

that works for you.

that's what i'm doing.

we have a closing tradition on this podcast

where the last leaves a question for the next not knowing who they're leaving it for.

you know this person

um

because i've seen you with them.

um

the question they left for you is what is a book

or books that you've recommended or gifted more than others

and why? can't say your own but right

um

there are three books

there's a book on evolution

written by richard dawkins

uh

river from eden

i think it's called

then

a book by um will and ariel durant

which are the maybe the greatest historians in time

and it's called lessons from history

it's a very short book.

i think it's 104 pages. they wrote massive amounts about 5, 000 years of history and so on.

and they sort of condense their lessons, lessons from history. and then um

joseph campbell's the hero's journey. is it the the hero with a thousand faces?

yes, that's it.

hero with a thousand faces.

and why dawkins book?

why did you say that one? oh, he understands evolution.

everything is evolving. okay. all species.

man is one of 10, 000 species.

i mean, and they're and they're all structured similarly. there's a structure. they

they

you know,

like

um

two eyes, a brain that has a structure to it. um

that and the same parts of the brain. there's the cereum,

the cerebellum, the prefrontal cortex. there's this structure that makes you think differently

# Chapter 7

which are the maybe the greatest historians in time

and it's called lessons from history

it's a very short book.

i think it's 104 pages. they wrote massive amounts about 5, 000 years of history and so on.

and they sort of condense their lessons, lessons from history. and then um

joseph campbell's the hero's journey. is it the the hero with a thousand faces?

yes, that's it.

hero with a thousand faces.

and why dawkins book?

why did you say that one? oh, he understands evolution.

everything is evolving. okay. all species.

man is one of 10, 000 species.

i mean, and they're and they're all structured similarly. there's a structure. they

they

you know,

like

um

two eyes, a brain that has a structure to it. um

that and the same parts of the brain. there's the cereum,

the cerebellum, the prefrontal cortex. there's this structure that makes you think differently

and and so on. there's evolution. there's all evolution.

so, it's not just limited to um

human evolution or what humans are like.

it's the force of evolution. man is only

um

mankind's only about 200, 000 years old. that's in history

that's short.

okay.

and and the species and all species evolve. okay. and it's very interesting.

so that's and you know that's what his books are about

and you know i think they're very good

and joseph campbell's the hero's journey

the hero

with

it's

it's

about human nature and and the evolution of life and the life journey that we're talking about.

what i find so interesting ray is how you draw on principles from other domains

whether it's from nature or biology

as you were talking about there to tie into your work in business

and investing and everything else and life and happiness.

and it really says something to me about being more eclectic

and be broadly curious in order to be successful in my more narrative.

yeah. i just see i i don't

is that to me

maybe too much of a specialist kind of mentality

but the world is being interrelated to these things if you want to understand how reality works.

um

you can't say i'm going to be just a specialist.

i mean these are all affected by each other.

thank you so much for write writing these books. they are iconic

and

uh

the youtube videos that explain these

these books are iconic.

i don't know who you have on your team that makes the animations and pulls it all together.

but not only is the content so important

because they are principles, so they're enduring through time, but they're so unbelievably accessible to all people of all ages.

and if

if you

if people haven't read this book, i'd be shocked. but

um

all of these books are fantastic. the this book, principles by ray dalia,

which i'm going to link all of them below for anyone that wants to read them.

i suggest you read them all, um

will be formative in your life, even if you're not interested in business or investing

because as as it says on the book, they're principles and the

the economy affects us all in ways that we might not understand.

we're all trying to be successful or happy in our own right.

and that that's interwoven into all of these books.

so, thank you.

i hope you write more books.

well, and thank you because yeah, i'm at a stage in my life, this is a symbiotic relationship

otherwise we wouldn't be here. okay.

and my

um

my benefit is that i want to pass along these things and we're doing it together.

and i have found

and it's joyous to me to know that these things have made a big difference in people's lives.

people come up to me and they say, " thank you for the difference you've made.

" and you know, at this stage in my life, that's what i want to do.

i think that's an understatement.

i think it's had a profound impact.

in fact, every person i know, all of my best friends have taken something from your work

which has had a profound impact on their decision-m which has led them to be happier in some way.

and

when i told my friends

that i was interviewing you, i'm interviewing 16 people while i'm in new york over the over the next month.

when i told my friends, my best friends in the world,

that i'm interviewing you, all of them were telling me to pass on a message of thanks

because there's something in one of these books that's helped them.

and they're all young people in that first season of their life.

and there's there's something in all of these books that's um pushed them closer to their success

and their happiness.

so, thank you for on behalf of me because you've had a profound impact on me.

but thank you. thank you for giving me that joy.

you know that. thank you. i really really mean that. thank you so much, ray.
