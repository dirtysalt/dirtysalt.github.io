# Chapter 1

the following is a conversation with neil ferguson

 one of the great historians of our time at times controversial

 and always brilliant

 whether you agree with him or not

 he's an author of 16 books

 on topics

 covering

 the history of money power

 war pandemics

 and empire

 previously at harvard currently at stanford and today

 launching a new university here in austin texas called the university of austin a new institution

 built from the ground up to encourage open inquiry and discourse

 by both thinkers and doers from philosophers and historians

 to scientists and engineers

 embracing debate dissent and self-examination

 free to speak to disagree to think to explore truly novel ideas

 the advisory board includes stephen pinker jonathan height and many other amazing people with one exception

 me

 i was graciously invited to be on the advisory board which i accepted

 in the hope of doing my small part in helping build the future of education

 and open discourse

 especially in the fields of artificial intelligence robotics and computing

 we spend the first hour of this conversation talking about this new university

 before switching to

 talking about some of the darkest moments in human history

 and what they reveal

 about human nature

 this is the lex friedman podcast

 to support it please check out our sponsors in the description

 and now here's my conversation with neil ferguson

 you are one of the great historians of our time respected sometimes controversial

 you've flourished in some of the best universities in the world from nyu

 to london school of economics to harvard

 and now to hoover institution at stanford

 before we talk about the history of money war and power

 let us talk about a new university

 you're part of launching

 here in austin texas

 it is called university of austin

 uatx

 what is its mission its goals its plan

 i think it's pretty obvious

 to a lot of people in higher education that there's a problem

 and that problem manifests itself in a great many different ways

 but i would sum up the problem as being

 a drastic

 chilling of the atmosphere

 that constrains free speech free exchange even free thought

 and i had never anticipated

 that this would happen in my lifetime my academic career began in oxford in the 1980s

 when

 anything went one sensed that a university was a place where one could risk

 saying the unsayable and debate the undebatable

 so the fact that in a relatively short space of time

 a variety

 of ideas

 critical race theory or wokeism

 whatever you want to call a variety of ideas have come along

 that seek to limit and quite drastically limit what we can talk about

 strikes me as deeply unhealthy

 and i'm not

 sure

 and i've thought about this for a long time you can fix

 it with the existing

 institutions

 i think you need to create a new one and so after much deliberation

 we decided to do it and i think it's a hugely timely opportunity

 to

 do what people used to do in this country which was to create new institutions

 i mean that used to be the default setting of america

 we sort of stopped doing that i mean i look back and i thought why why

 why are there no new universities

 or at least if there are why do they have so little impact

 it seems like we have the billionaires

 we have the need let's do it so you still believe

 in institutions in the university in the ideal of the university

 i believe passionately in that ideal

 there's a reason they've been around for nearly a millennium

 there is a a unique thing that happens

 on a university

 campus when it's done right and that is the transfer of knowledge between generations

 that is a very sacred activity and it seems to

 withstand

 major changes in technology so this form that we call the university predates the printing press

 survive the printing press

 continue to function through the scientific revolution the enlightenment

 the industrial revolution

 to this day and i think it's because

 maybe because of evolutionary psychology we need to be together

 in one relatively confined

 space

 when we're in our late teens and early 20s

 for the knowledge transfer between the generations to happen

 that's my feeling about this but in order for it to work well

 there need to be very few constraints

 there needs to be a sense that one can take intellectual risk remember

 people in their late teens and early 20s are adults but they're inexperienced adults

 and if i look back on my own time as an undergraduate

 saying stupid things was my mo

 my way to finding

 good ideas was through a minefield

 of bad ideas

 i feel so sorry

 for my

 for people like me today people age 18 19 20 today

 who are

 intellectually

 very curious ambitious but inexperienced

 because the minefields today

 are absolutely lethal and you know one wrong food

 and it's cancellation i said this to peter thiel the other day

 imagine being asked now i mean we were obnoxious

 undergraduates

 there's nothing

 that peter did at stanford that andrew sullivan and i were not doing at oxford

 and perhaps we were even worse

 but it was so so not career ending to be to be an absolutely insufferable

 obnoxious

 undergraduate then

 today if we if we

 if people like us exist today they must live in a state of of constant anxiety

 that they're going to be

 outed for some heretical

 statement that they made five years ago on social media so

 part of what motivates me is that it's the desire to give

 the means of today a shot at free thinking and really i i'd call it

 aggressive learning learning where you're really pushed

 and i just think that stopped happening

 on the the major campuses

 because whether at harvard where i used to teach at stanford where i'm now based i

 i sense a kind of suffocating

 atmosphere of self-censorship

 that that means people are afraid

 to take even minimal risk in in class i mean just just take for example

 a survey that was published

 earlier this year that revealed

 this is of undergraduates in four-year programs in the us

 85 percent of self-described liberal students said they would report a professor to the university administration

 if he or she said something they considered offensive

 and something like 75 said said they do it to a fellow undergraduate

 that's the kind of culture that's evolved in our universities

 so we need a new university in which none of that is true

 in which you can speak your mind

 say stupid things get it completely wrong

 and live to

 to tell the tale there's a lot more going on i think because

 when you start thinking about what's wrong with a modern university

 many many more things suggest themselves

 and i think there's an opportunity

 here to build something that's radically new in in some ways and radically traditional

 in other ways for example i have a strong preference for

 the tutorial system that you see at oxford and cambridge which is small group teaching

 and and highly socratic in its structure

 i think it'd be great to bring that to the united states where it doesn't really

 exist but at the same time i think we should be doing

 some very 21st century things

 making sure that while people are reading and studying classic works

 they're also going to be immersed in the real world

 of technological innovation a world that you know very well

 and i'd love to get a synthesis

 of the ancient and classical which we're gradually letting fade away with the novel

 and technological so we we want to produce people who can simultaneously talk intelligently

 about adam smith or for that matter shakespeare or proust and

 have a conversation with you about where a.i is going

 and how long it will be before i can get driven

 here by

 a self-driving

 vehicle allowing me to have my lunch and prepare rather than

 focus on

 the other crazy people on the road so

 that's the dream that we can create something which is

 you know partly classical and partly 21st century

 and we look around

 and we we don't see it if you if you don't see an institution

 that you really think should exist

 i think you have a more responsibility to create it

 so you're thinking including

 something bigger than just liberal education also including science engineering and technology i should also comment

 that

 you know i mostly stay out of politics and out of some of these

 aspects of liberal education that kind of been the most controversial and difficult within the university

 but there is a kind of ripple effect of fear within that space

 into science and engineering and technology that i think

 has

 has a nature that's difficult to describe

 it doesn't have a controversial nature it just has a nature of fear where you're not

 you know you're not just saying stupid stuff as a young 20 year old

 you know

 for example

 deep learning

 machine learning is really popular

 in the computer science now as an approach for creating artificial intelligence systems

 it's

 it is controversial in that space to say that

 anything against machine learning saying

 sort of exploring ideas that saying this is going to lead to a dead end

 um now that that takes some guts to do as a young 20 year old within

 within a classroom

 to think like that to raise that question in a machine learning course it sounds ridiculous

 because it's like who's going to

 complain about this but the the fear that starts

 in

 in a course on history

 or

 on the some course that covers society the fear ripples

 and affects those students they're asking big out of the box questions about engineering

 about computer science

 and there's a lot you know there's like linear algebra that's not going to change

 but then there's like applied

 linear algebra which is machine learning and that's when

 robots and

 real systems touch human beings and that's when you have to

 ask yourself these difficult questions about

 about humanity

 even in engineering and science and technology courses and these are not

 separate worlds in two senses

 i've just

 taken delivery of my copy of the book that eric schmidt and henry kissinger have

 co-authored

 on artificial intelligence the central

 question of which is what does this mean for us broadly

 but they're not separate worlds

 you know in cp snow's

 sense of you know the the chasm between science and arts because on a university campus

 everything is contagious from a novel coronavirus to the behaviors that are occurring

 in the english department

 those behaviors if denunciation

 becomes a norm

 you know undergraduate denounces

 professor teaching assistant denounces undergraduate those behaviors are contagious and will spread inexorably

 first to social science and then to natural sciences and i think that's

 that's part of the reason why

 when this started to happen when we started to get the origins of

 disinvitation and cancel culture

 it was not just

 a few conservative

 professors in the humanities who had to worry everybody

 had to worry because eventually

 it was going to come even to the most apparently

 hard stem

 part of the the campus

 it's it's contagious this is something nicholas christakis should look at because he's

 very good at looking at the way in which

 social networks like the ones that exist in a university can spread

 everything

 but i think when when we look back and ask why did wokism

 spread so rapidly

 and rapidly out of humanities into other parts of universities and why did it spread

 across the country and d beyond the united states to the other english-speaking

 universities it's because it's a contagion

 and and these behaviors are contagious

 the president of a university

 i won't name said to me that he receives

 every day at least one denunciation

 one call for somebody or other to be fired for something that they

 said

 that's the crazy kind of totalitarianism

 light

 that now exists in our our universities

 and of course the people who want to downplay

 this say oh well there only have been 100 and something in dis invitations

 or oh there really aren't that many cases but the point is that

 the famous events the events that get the attention

 are responsible for a general chilling

 that as you say spreads to every part of the university

 and creates a

 very familiar culture

 in which people are afraid to say what they think self-censorship

 look at the heterodox academy data on this

 grows and grows so now a majority

 of students will say this is clear from the latest heterodox

 academy surveys

 we are scared to say what we think in case

 we get denounced in case we get cancelled

 but that's just not the correct atmosphere

 for a university in a free society

 to me what's really

 creepy

 is how many of the behaviors i see

 on university campuses today are reminiscent

 of the way that people used to behave in the soviet union

 or in the soviet bloc or in maui's china

 the sort of totalitarianism

 light that i think we're we're contending with here which manifests itself as denunciations

 people informing on superiors some people using it for career advantage

 and creates a

 very familiar culture

 or in the soviet bloc or in maui's china

 the sort of totalitarianism

 light that i think we're we're contending with here which manifests itself as denunciations

 people informing on superiors some people using it for career advantage

 other people reduced to hapless desperate apology to try to exonerate themselves people disappearing

 metaphorically if not literally all of this is so reminiscent

 of the totalitarian

 regimes that i studied earlier in my career that it makes me feel

 sick

 and what makes me really feel sick is that

 the people

 doing this stuff the people who write the letters of denunciation

 are apparently

 unaware that they're behaving exactly like people in stalin's soviet union they don't know that

 so they clearly have there's been a massive educational failure

 if somebody can write an anonymous or non-anonymous letter of denunciation

 and not feel shame

 i mean you should feel morally completely contaminated

 as you are doing that but but people haven't been taught the realities of totalitarianism

 for all these reasons i think

 you need to

 try at least to create a new institution

 where those pathologies will be

 structurally excluded

 so

 maybe a difficult question maybe you'll push back on this

 but you're widely seen politically as a conservative

 hoover institution is politically conservative

 what is the role of politics at the university of austin because some of the ideas

 people listening to this when they hear the ideas you're expressing

 they may think there's a lien to these ideas

 there's a conservative

 lean to these ideas is there such a lien

 there will certainly be people who say that because the standard

 mode of trying to discredit any new initiative is to say oh this is a sinister

 conservative

 plot but one of our co-founders heather heing is definitely not a conservative

 she's as committed to the idea of academic freedom

 as i am

 but i think on political issues we probably agree on almost nothing

 and at least i i would guess

 but but politics

 max weber made this point a long time ago

 the politics really should stop at the threshold of the

 the classroom

 of the lecture

 hall

 and in my career

 i've always

 tried to make sure that when i'm teaching

 it's not

 clear where i stand politically

 though of course undergraduates

 and insatiably

 curiously

 want to know but it shouldn't be clear from what i say because indoctrination

 on a political basis

 is

 an abuse of the power of the professor

 as weber rightly said

 so i think one of the key principles

 of of the university of austin will be that barbarian principle

 that politics is not

 an appropriate

 subject for the lecture hall for the classroom and we should pursue truth

 and enshrine

 liberty of thought

 if that's a political issue then i can't help you i mean if you're against

 freedom of thought then we don't really have much of a discussion to have

 and clearly there are some people who politically

 seem quite hostile

 to it but my sense is that there are plenty

 of people on the left in academia

 i think of

 that interesting partnership between cornell west

 and robbie george

 which has been institutionalized

 in the academic freedom alliance it's bipartisan

 this issue it really really is after all

 50 years ago it was the left that was in favor of free speech

 the right still has an anti-free speech

 element to it look how quickly they're out to

 ban critical race theory critical race theory won't be banned at the university of texas

 wokism won't be banned

 everything will be up for discussion

 but the rules of engagement will be clear chicago principles

 those will be enforced

 and if you have to give a lecture on well let's just take a recent example

 the dorian abbott case if you're giving a lecture on astrophysics

 but it turns out that in some different venue

 you express skepticism

 about a formative action

 well it doesn't matter it's irrelevant

 we want to know what your thoughts are on astrophysics because that's

 what you're supposed to be doing a lecture on that used to be understood

 i mean at the oxford of the 1980s

 there were communists

 and there were ultratories

 at cambridge there were people who were so reactionary

 that they celebrated franco's birthday

 but they were also out and out communists

 down the road at king's college

 the understanding was that that kind of intellectual diversity

 was part and parcel of

 university

 life and frankly for undergraduate

 it was great fun to cross the road and go from

 you know outright conservatism

 ultra

 tourism to communism one learns a lot that way

 but the issue is when you're promoting or hiring or tenuring people

 their politics is not relevant it really isn't

 and when it started to become relevant

 and i remember this coming up at the harvard history department late in my time there

 felt deeply deeply uneasy

 that we were having conversations

 that amounted to well we can't heart x person despite their obvious academic qualifications because

 of some political issue that that's not what should happen at a healthy university

 some practical questions

 will university of austin be a physical in person university or virtual university what are some

 in that aspect where the classroom is it will be a real space institution

 there may be an online

 dimension to it because there clearly are a lot of things that you can do

 via the internet but the core activity

 of of teaching and learning i think requires

 real space and i've

 thought about this a long time debated

 sebastian

 throne about this many many years ago when he was a complete

 believer in

 let's call it the metaversity

 to go with the metaverse i mean the metaversity

 was going to happen wasn't it but i never really believed in the metaversity

 i didn't do moocs because i just didn't think you'd a be able to retain

 the attention b be able to cope with the scale

 scaled

 grading that was involved

 i think

 there's a reason universities have been around and that they're formed for about a millennium

 you kind of need to all be in the same place

 so i think answer to that question definitely

 a campus in the austin area that's where we'll start

 and if we can

 allow some of our content to be available online great we'll certainly do that

 another question is what kind of courses and programming

 will it offer is that something you can speak to what's your vision here

 we think that we need to begin

 more like a startup than

 like a full service university

 from day one so our vision is that we start with a summer school

 which will offer provocatively the forbidden courses we we want i think to begin by giving

 a platform

 to the professors who've been most

 subject to council culture and also to give an opportunity

 to students

 who want to hear them to come so we'll start with the summer

 school that will be

 somewhat in the tradition of

 of those institutions

 in the interwar period that were havens for refugees

 so we're we are dealing here with the internal refugees

 of

 of the work era

 we'll start there it'll be an opportunity to test out some

 some content see what students will come

 and spend time in austin to hear so that's part a that's the sort of

 if if you like the launch product and then we go straight to a masters

 program i don't think you can go to undergraduate education right away

 because the established brands in undergraduate education are offering

 something it's impossible to compete with initially because they have the brand harvard yale stanford

 and they offer also this peer network

 which is part of the reason people want

 so badly to go to those places not really the professors

 it's the

 classmates

 so we don't want to compete there initially

 where there is i think room for new entrants is in

 a masters program

 and the first one will be in entrepreneurship and leadership

 because i think there's a huge hunger

 amongst people who want to get into particularly the technology world

 to learn about those things and they know they're not really

 going to learn about

 them at business

 schools

 the people who are not going to teach them leadership and entrepreneurship

 are professors

 so we want to create something that will

 be a little like

 the very successful

 schwarzman

 program

 in china which was come and spend a year in china and find out about china

 we'll be doing the same

 essentially saying come and spend a year and find out about technology

 and there'll be a mix of academic content

 we want people to understand

 some of the first principles of what they're studying

 there are first principles of entrepreneurship

 and leadership but we also want them to spend time with

 people like one of our co-founders

 joe lonsdale who's been a hugely

 successful venture capitalist and and learned directly from people

 like him so

 that's the kind of initial

 offering i think there are other masters

 programs

 that we will look to roll out quite quickly

 i have a particular passion

 for a masters in applied history or politics and applied history

 i'm a historian driven crazy by the tendency of academic historians

 to drift away from

 what seemed to me the important questions

 and certainly to drift away from addressing

 policy relevant questions so i would love to be involved in

 in in a masters in applied history

 and we'll we'll build some programs like that before we get to the full liberal arts

 experience that we envisage for an undergraduate program

 and that undergraduate

 program is an exciting one because i think we can be innovative there too i

 i would say two years

 would be spent

 doing some very classical

 and difficult classical things

 those old divides between arts and sciences

 but then there would also be in the second

 in the second half in the junior and senior years

 something somewhat more of an apprenticeship

 where we'll have centers including a center for technology engineering mathematics

 that will be designed to to help people make that transition

 from the theoretical to the the practical

 so that's the vision

 and i think like any like any early stage

 idea

 we'll doubtless tweak it as we go along

 we'll find things that work and things that don't work

 but i have a very clear

 sense in my own mind of how this

 should look five years from now

 and i don't know about you i mean i i'm unusual

 as an academic because i quite like starting new institutions

 and i've done a bit of it

 in my career

 you got to kind of know what it should look like

 after

 the first

 four or five

 years

 to

 get out of bed in the morning

 and put up with all the kind of

 hassles of doing it not not least the inevitable

 flack that we we're bound to take from the educational

 establishment

 and i was graciously invited to be an advisor to this

 university of austin and one the reason i would

 love to help in whatever way i can

 is several so one i would love to see austin the physical location flourish intellectually

 and especially

 in the space of science and engineering that's really exciting to me

 another reason is i am still a research scientist at mit i still love mit

 and i see this effort

 that you're launching as a as a

 beacon

 that leads the way to the other elite institutions in the world

 i think too many of my colleagues and especially in robotics

 kind of see

 don't see robotics as a humanities problem but to me

 robotics and ai will define much of our world in the next century

 and for not to consider

 all the deep psychological sociological

 human problems associated with that

 to have real open conversations to say stupid things to challenge

 the ideas that

 of how companies are being run for example

 that is the safe space it's very difficult to talk about the difficult questions about technology

 when you're employed by facebook or google and so on

 the university

 is the place to have those conversations

 that's right we're hugely excited

 that you want to be one of our advisors

 we we need a

 a broad

 and an eclectic

 group of people

 and i'm excited by the way that group has

 has has developed

 it has some of the some of my favorite intellectuals are there steve pinker for example

 but but we're also you know making sure that we have people with experience in

 academic leadership

 and so it's a it's a happy coalition of the willing

 looking to try to build something new which as you say will be complementary

 to

 the existing and established institutions

 i think of the academic world as a as a network

 i've moved from some major hubs

 in the network

 to others but i've always felt that we do our best work

 not in a silo

 called oxford but

 in a silo that

 that is really a hub connected

 to stanford

 connected

 to

 harvard

 connected to mit

 one of the reasons

 i moved to the united

 states was that i sensed

 that there was

 more

 intellectual

 action in my original field of expertise

 financial history and

 that was right it was it was a good move i think i'd have stagnated

 if i'd stayed

 at oxford

 but at the same time i i haven't lost connection

 with oxford i recently went and gave a lecture there

 in honour of sir roger scrutin one of the great conservative philosophers

 and the burden of my lecture was

 the idea of the anglo-sphere which appealed a lot to roger will go horribly wrong if

# Chapter 3

 connected

 to

 harvard

 connected to mit

 one of the reasons

 i moved to the united

 states was that i sensed

 that there was

 more

 intellectual

 action in my original field of expertise

 financial history and

 that was right it was it was a good move i think i'd have stagnated

 if i'd stayed

 at oxford

 but at the same time i i haven't lost connection

 with oxford i recently went and gave a lecture there

 in honour of sir roger scrutin one of the great conservative philosophers

 and the burden of my lecture was

 the idea of the anglo-sphere which appealed a lot to roger will go horribly wrong if

 illiberal ideas that inhibit academic freedom spread all over the anglo-sphere

 and this network gets infected with

 these i think deeply

 deeply damaging notions so yeah i think we're creating a new node

 i hope it's a node that makes the network overall

 more resilient

 and

 right now there's an urgent need for it i mean there are people

 whose academic careers have been terminated

 i'll name two who are involved peter bogosian who was harassed out of portland state

 for the reason that he was one of those

 intrepid figures who carried out the grievance studies

 hoaxes

 exposing the utter charlatan ray going on in many supposedly academic journals by getting phony

 gender studies articles published was genius and of course

 so put the noses out of joints of the academic establishment

 that he began to be subject to disciplinary

 actions

 so peter is going to be involved and in a recent

 shocking british case

 the philosopher kathleen stock has essentially been run off the campus of sussex university

 in england

 for trans

 for violating the the increasingly complex rules about discussing

 transgender

 issues and

 women's rights

 she will be

 one of our advisors and i think also one of our founding

 fellows actually teaching

 for us in our in our first iteration so

 i think we're creating a node that's badly needed

 those people i mean i remember saying this to

 the the other founders when we first began to talk about this idea

 to barry weiss

 and to panic and losses pano canelos as well as to heather heing

 we need to do this urgently

 because there are people whose livelihoods are in fact being destroyed

 by these extraordinarily

 illiberal campaigns

 against them and so

 there's no time to hang around and come up with the perfect design

 this this is an urgently needed lifeboat

 and let's start with that and then we can build something spectacular

 taking advantage of the fact that all of these people have

 well they now have very

 real skin in the game they they need to make this a success

 and and i'm sure they will help us make it a success

 so you mentioned some interesting names like heather heing barry weiss and so on

 stephen

 pinker somebody i really admire

 he too was under a lot of quite a lot of fire

 many reasons i admire him one because of his optimism about the future and two

 how little of a dam he seems to give

 about the

 like walking

 through the fire

 there's nobody

 more zen

 about

 walking

 through the fire

 than stephen

 pinker

 but

 anyway you mentioned a lot of interesting names jonathan height is also interesting there

 um who is involved with this venture at this early days

 well

 one of the

 one of the things that that i'm excited

 about is

 is that we're getting people from

 inside and outside the academic world so we've got

 arthur brooks who for many years ran the american enterprise very s enterprise institute very successfully

 has a harvard role now teaching

 and and so he's somebody who brings i think a different perspective

 there's obviously a a need to get experienced

 academic leaders involved

 which is why i was talking to larry summers about

 whether he would join our board of advisors

 the chicago principals owe a debt to the former president of chicago and he's

 graciously

 agreed to be in the board of advisors

 i could go on it would become a long and tedious list but

 my goal in in trying to get this happy band to form has been

 to signal that it's a bipartisan

 endeavor it is not

 a conservative institution that we're trying to build it's an institution that's committed to academic freedom

 and the pursuit of truth

 that will mean it when it takes

 robert zimmer's chicago principles and enshrines them in its its founding charter and will make those

 something other than honored in the breach which they seem to be at some institutions

 so the idea here is is to grow this organically

 we need

 rather like the academic freedom alliance that robbie george created earlier this year we need breadth

 and we need to show that this is not some kind of

 institutionalization of the intellectual dark web though we welcome founding members of that

 that

 nebulous body it's really something designed for all of academia

 to provide a kind of reboot that i i think we all agree is is needed

 is there a george washington

 type figure who is is there a president

 elected yet or is is

 who's going to lead this institution hannah canelos

 the former president of st john's

 is the president of university of austin

 and so he is our george washington

 i don't know who alexander hamilton is i'll lead you to guess

 it's funny you mentioned idw intellectual dark web have you

 talked to your friend sam harris about but any others he

 um

 he is another person i really admire and i've talked to online and offline

 quite a bit for

 not belonging to any tribe he stands boldly on his convictions

 when he knows they're not going to be popular

 with like he based

 he basically gets canceled by every group he sort of he doesn't shy away from controversy

 and not for the sake of controversy itself he is

 one of the best examples to me of a person who thinks freely

 i disagree with him on a few quite a few things

 but

 i deeply admire

 that he is he he is what it looks like to think freely by himself

 it feels to me like he represents

 a lot of the ideals of this kind of effort yes he would be a natural

 fit sam if you're listening i hope you're in

 i think in in the course of his recent intellectual

 quests

 he did collide with one of our founders heather hying so

 we'll have to model civil disagreements

 at the university of austin it's extremely

 important that we should all disagree about many things but do it

 amicably

 one of the things that has been lost

 sight of perhaps

 it's all the fault of twitter or maybe it's something more profound

 is that

 it is possible to disagree

 in a civil way and

 and still be friends i certainly had

 friends at oxford who were

 far to the left of me politically

 and

 they are still among my best friends so

 the university of austin has to be a place where we can

 disagree

 we can disagree vehemently

 but we can then go and have a beer afterwards

 that's that's in my mind a really important part of university life learning

 the difference between the political

 and the

 and the personal

 so sam

 is a

 i think a a

 good example

 as a you

 of

 a certain kind of intellectual

 hero

 who has been willing to go into the cyber

 sphere the metaverse and carve out an intellectual

 space

 the podcast and debate everything fearlessly his

 essay was really an essay on black lives matter and the question of police

 racism

 was a masterpiece of 2020

 and

 and so he i think is a a model of what we believe in

 but we can't save the world with podcasts good though

 yours is

 because there's a kind of

 solo element

 to this form of public intellectual activities

 it's also there in substance where all our best writers

 now seem to be including our founder barry weiss

 the danger with this

 approach is ultimately

 your subscribers are the people who already agree with you and we are all therefore

 in danger of preaching

 to the choir

 i think what makes an institution

 like university of austin so attractive

 is that we get everybody

 together

 at least part of the year and we do that informal interaction at lunch at dinner

 that allows

 in my experience the best ideas to form

 intellectual activity isn't really a solo voyage

 historians often make it seem that way but i've realized over time that

 i do my best work in a collaborative

 way and scientists have been better at this than people in the humanities

 but what really matters what what's magical about a good university is that interdisciplinary

 serendipitous

 conversation that happens on campus

 tom sergeant the great nobel prize-winning economist and i used to have these

 kind of random conversations in elevators at nyu or in corridors at stanford

 and sometimes they'd be quite short conversations

 but in that short serendipitous exchange

 i would have

 more intellectual stimulus than in in many a seminar lasting an hour and a half so

 i think we want to get the sam harris's and and lex friedman's

 out of their darkened rooms

 and give them a chance to interact in a much less structured

 way than we've got got used to again

 it's that it's that sense that sometimes you need some free willing

 unstructured

 debate to get the really good ideas

 i mean to talk anecdotally for a moment i look back on my oxford

 undergraduate

 experience and i wrote a lot of essays and attended a lot of classes but

 intellectually the most important thing i did

 was to write an essay on the viennese satirist carl krause

 for a an undergraduate

 discussion group called the cannon club

 and i probably put more work into that paper

 than i put into anything else except maybe my final examinations

 even although

 there was only really one senior member present

 the

 historian

 jeremy cato i was really just trying to impress my contemporaries

 and that's the kind of thing we want the great intellectuals

 the great intellectual leaps forward occurred

 often in somewhat unstructured settings

 i'm from scotland you can tell from my accent a little at least

 the enlightenment happened in late 18th century scotland in a very interesting

 interplay between the universities which were very important glasgow edinburgh st andrews and

 the coffee houses and and pubs of

 the scottish cities where

 a lot of unstructured discussion often

 fueled by copious amounts of wine to place

 that's what i've missed

 over the last few years

 let's let's just think about how hard academic

 social life has become

 that we've reached the point

 that amy chua

 becomes the object of a full-blown investigation

 and media storm for inviting to yale law school students over to her house

 to talk

 i mean when i was at oxford it was regarded as a tremendous

 honor to be asked to go to one of our tutors homes

 the social life of oxford and cambridge is one of their great strengths

 there's a sort of requirement

 to

 sip unpleasant

 sherry

 with

 the dons

 and we've kind of killed all that

 we've killed all that in the us because nobody

 dares

 have a social interaction with an undergraduate

 or

 exchange

 an informal

 email in case the whole thing ends up on the front page of the local

 or student newspaper so that that's what we need to kind of restore

 the

 the social life of academia so there's magic we didn't really address it sort of explicitly

 but there's magic to the interaction between students there's magic in the interaction between

 faculty

 the people that teach and there's the magic and the interaction

 between the students and the faculty

 and it's

 it's an iterative process that changes everybody involved

 so it's like world experts in a particular discipline are changed

 as much as the students as the 20 year olds with the with the wild ideas

 each are changed and that's the magic of it that applies in liberal education

 that applies in this in the sciences too

 that's probably maybe you can speak to this why so much

 scientific innovation has happened in universities

 there's something about the youthful energy of like young minds

 graduate students undergraduate

 students that inspire

 some of the world experts to do some of the best work of their lives

 yeah well the human brain

 we know is at its most dynamic

 when people are pretty young

 you know this with your background in math

 people don't get better at math after the age of 30.

 and

 this is important when you think about the intergenerational character of university

 the older

 people the professors have the experience

 but they're fading intellectually

 from much earlier than anybody really wants to admit and so you get this intellectual

 shot in the arm

 from hanging out with people who are circa 20

 don't know shit

 but the brains are kind of like cooking yeah

 i look back on

 the career i've had in teaching which is over 25 years where cambridge oxford

 nyu harvard and

 i have extremely strong relationships with with students from those institutions

 because

 they would show up whether it was at office hours or in tutorials

 and disagree with me and for me it's always been about encouraging

 some active intellectual rebellion

 telling people

 i don't want your essay

 to echo my views

 if you can find something wrong with what i wrote

 great or if you can find something i missed that's new

 fantastic

 so there is definitely as you said a magic in that interaction across the generations

 and it's extraordinarily

 difficult i think for an intellectual to make the same progress

 in a project in isolation

 compared with the progress that can be made in these very very special communities

# Chapter 4

 but the brains are kind of like cooking yeah

 i look back on

 the career i've had in teaching which is over 25 years where cambridge oxford

 nyu harvard and

 i have extremely strong relationships with with students from those institutions

 and it's extraordinarily

 difficult i think for an intellectual to make the same progress

 in a project in isolation

 compared with the progress that can be made in these very very special communities

 what does a university do amongst other things

 it creates a somewhat artificial environment

 of of abnormal job security that's the whole idea of giving people tenure

 and then a relatively high turnover new faces each year and an institutionalization

 of thought experiments and actual experiments

 and then you get everybody living in the same kind of vicinity

 so that it can spill over into 3 a.m conversation

 well that that always seems to me to be

 a pretty potent combination

 let's ask ourselves a counterfactual

 question next let's imagine let's imagine that

 the the world wars happen

 but but there are no universities

 i mean how does the manhattan project happen with with no academia

 to take just one of many examples in truth

 how does britain even stay in the war without bletchley park without

 be being able to crack the german

 cipher the academics are unsung partly sung heroes of these conflicts

 the same is true in the soviet union the soviet union was a terribly

 evil and repressive system but it was good at science and that kept it

 in the game not only in

 in world war ii kept it in the cold war so

 it's clear that universities are incredibly powerful intellectual force multipliers

 and our our history without them

 would look very different

 sure some innovations would have happened without them that's clear the industrial revolution

 didn't need universities in fact they played a very marginal role

 in the key technological breakthroughs of the industrial revolution

 in its first phase

 but by the second industrial revolution in the late 19th century

 german industry would not have leapt ahead of british industry if the universities

 had not been superior

 and it was the fact that the germans institutionalized

 scientific research in the way that they did that really produced a powerful powerful advantage

 the problem was that

 this is a really interesting point

 that friedrich meinecker makes in d deutsche catestor for the german catastrophe

 the german intellectuals became technocrats

 homo faber he says they knew a great deal about their speciality

 but they were alienated

 from broadly speaking humanism

 and that is his explanation one of his explanations for why this very scientifically advanced germany

 goes down the path of hell led by hitler

 so when i come back and ask myself

 what is it that we want to do with

 a new university

 we want to make sure that we we don't fall into that that german

 pit where very high levels of technical and scientific expertise

 are decoupled from the fundamental

 foundations of of a free society

 so liberal arts are there i think to stop the scientists

 making fausty impacts and that that's why it's really important that people working on ai

 read shakespeare i think you

 said the academics are unsung heroes of the 20th century

 i think there's kind of an intellectual

 a lazy intellectual desire to kind of

 destroy the academics that the academics are the source of all problems in the world

 and i personally believe that exactly as you said we need to recognize that

 the university

 is probably

 where

 the ideas that will protect us from the catastrophes

 that are looming

 ahead of us

 is that's where those ideas are going to come from people who who work on economics

 can argue back and forth about john main arcanes

 but i think it's pretty clear that he was the most important economist

 and certainly the most influential economist

 of the 20th century and i think his ideas are looking

 better

 today in the wake of the financial crisis than they

 have at any time since the 1970s

 but imagine

 imagine john maynard keynes without cambridge you can't because someone like that doesn't actually

 doesn't actually exist without the incredible hot house

 that a place like cambridge wars in keynes's

 life he was a product

 of a kind of hereditary

 intellectual

 elite

 it had its vices

 but you can't help but admire

 the sheer power of the mind i've spent a lot of my career reading

 keynes and i i revere

 that intellect it's so so powerful

 but you can't have people like that if you're not prepared to have

 king's college cambridge

 and and it comes with redundancy

 i think that's the point there are lots and lots of things

 that are very annoying about academic life

 that you just have to

 you have to deal with they're they're made fun of in that recent netflix

 series the chair

 and it is easy to make fun of academic life

 tom sharpe's porterhouse blue did it it's it's an inherently comical

 subject professors at least used to be amusingly eccentric

 but we've sort of killed off that side of academia by turning it into an increasingly

 doctrinaire place

 where eccentricity

 is not tolerated

 i'll give you an illustration of this i had a call

 this morning from a british academic

 who said can you can you give me some advice because they're trying to decolonize

 the curriculum

 this is coming from the

 diversity equity and inclusion officers

 and it

 seems to me that what they're requiring of us is a fundamental

 violation of academic freedom because it is

 determining ex-ante what we should study and teach

 that's what's going on and

 that's the thing that we really

 really have to resist

 because that kills the university that's that's the moment that it stops being

 the magical place of intellectual creativity

 and simply becomes an adjunct of the ministry of propaganda

 i've loved

 the time we spent talking about this because

 it's such a hopeful message for the future of the university

 that

 i still share with you

 the love of the ideal of the university so very practical question you mentioned summer

 which summer are we talking about so when

 i know we don't want to put hard dates

 here but

 what year

 are we thinking about when is this thing launching

 what are your thoughts on this we are moving as fast

 as

 our resources

 allow

 the goal is to offer the first of the forbidden courses next summer summer of 2022

 and we hope to be able to launch an initial

 albeit relatively small scale masters program

 in the fall of next year that's that's as fast as is humanly possible

 so yeah we're

 really we're really keen to get going and i think the the approach we're taking is

 somewhat imported from silicon valley think of this as a startup

 don't think of this as something that has to exist as a full service university

 on on day one

 we don't have the results

 of that you

 need billions

 and billions of dollars

 to build a university

 sort of as a as a facsimile

 of an existing university but that's not what we want to do i mean copying

 copying and pasting harvard or year or stanford would be a futile thing to do

 they would probably you very quickly end up with the same pathologies

 so we do have to come up with a different design and

 one way of doing that is to grow it organically

 from something quite small

 elon musk

 mentioned in his usual humorous way on twitter

 that he wants to launch the texas institute of technology and science

 tits some people thought this was sexist because of the acronym tits

 so first of all i understand their viewpoint

 but i also think there needs to be a place for humor on the internet

 even from ceo

 so on this podcast i've gotten a chance to

 talk to quite a few ceos

 and what i love to see is authenticity

 and humor is often a sign of authenticity the

 the quirkiness

 that you mentioned is such a beautiful characteristic

 of professors and faculty and great universities

 is also beautiful to see as ceos especially founding ceo so anyway

 the deeper

 point he was making is showing an excitement

 for the university

 as a place for big ideas in

 science technology engineering so to me

 if there's some kind of way

 if there is a serious thought that he had behind this tweet

 not to analyze elon musk's twitter like it's shakespeare but if there's a serious thought

 um i would love to see him supporting

 the the flourishing of austin as a place for science technology

 for these kinds of intellectual developments that

 that that we're talking about like make make a place for free inquiry civil disagreements

 coupled with great education

 and conversations about artificial intelligence about technology about engineering so i'm actually gonna

 i hope there's a serious idea behind that tweet and i'm gonna

 i'm gonna chat with him about it i do too i do too i

 most of the

 biggest

 storms and teacups of my academic career have been caused by bad jokes that i've made

 these days if you want to make bad jokes being a billionaire is a great idea

 i'm not here to defend elon's

 twitter style or sense of humor

 he's not gonna be remembered for his

 tweets i think he's gonna be remembered for the astonishing

 companies that he's built and his his contributions

 in a whole range of of fields from spacex to tesla

 and solar energy and i very much hope that we can

 interest elon in this project we need

 not only elon but a whole range of his peers

 because

 this takes resources universities are not cheap things to run especially

 if as i hope we can make as much of

 the the tuition

 covered by scholarships and bursaries we we want to attract the best

 intellectual talent to this institution

 the best intellectual talent is somewhat randomly distributed through society

 and some of it is in the bottom quintile of the income distribution

 and that makes it hard to get to elite education so this will take resources

 the last generation of

 super wealthy plutocrats

 the generation of the gilded age of the late 19th century

 did a pretty good job of founding universities

 chicago wouldn't exist but for the money of that era

 and so my message to not only to elon but to all of

 the peers all of those people who made their billions

 out of technology

 over the last couple of decades is

 this is your time i mean and this is your opportunity to create something new

 i can't really understand

 why

 the wealthy of our time are content to hand their money

 i mean think of the vast

 sums mike bloomberg

 recently

 gave to johns hopkins

 to his established

 institutions

 when

 on close inspection those institutions don't seem to spend the money terribly well

 and in fact

 one of the mysteries of our time is the lack of due diligence

 that hard-nosed

 billionaires seem to do when it comes to philanthropy

 so

 i think there's an opportunity here for this generation of very talented wealthy people to

 to do what their

 their counterparts

 did in the late 90s and early 20th century and and create some new institutions

 and they don't need to

 put their names on the buildings

 they just need to do what what the

 founders of

 of chicago university of chicago did create something new that will that will endure

 yeah mit is launching a college of computing and

 um

 steven schwartzman has

 given quite a large sum of money i think in total a billion dollars

 and as somebody who loves computing and somebody who loves mit i want some accountability

 for mit becoming a better institution

 and

 this is once again why i'm excited about university

 of austin because it serves as a beacon

 look you can create something new

 and this is what the great institutions of the future should look like

 and steve schwartzman

 is also uh an innovator the idea of creating a college on the tsinghua campus

 and creating a kind of rhodes program

 for students

 from the western world to come study in china was

 was steve's idea

 and and i was somewhat involved did some visiting

 professing there

 it taught me that you can create something new

 in that area of graduate education and quite quickly attract really strong

 applicants because the people who finish their four years at harvard or stanford know

 that they don't know a lot and i having taught a lot of people

 in that group know how intellectually dissatisfied

 they often are at the end of four years

 i mean they may have beautifully gained the system to graduate

 sumo or magna cum laude but they kind of know

 they they'll confess

 it after a drink or two they know that they gained the system and that intellectually

 it wasn't

 the fulfilling experience they wanted and they also know that an mba

 from a comparable institution would not be a massive intellectual step forward

 so i think what we want to say

 is here's something really novel exciting

 that will

 be intellectually very challenging i i do think the university of austin has to be difficult

 yeah

 um i'd like it to feel a little bit like surviving

 navy seal training to come through this program because it will be intellectually

 demanding

 and that i think should be a magnet so yeah steve if you're listening

 please join elon in in supporting this and and

 and peter thiel if you're listening i know how skeptical

 you are about the idea of creating a new university because

 heaven

 knows peter and i have been discussing

 this idea for years and he's always

# Chapter 5

 they they'll confess

 it after a drink or two they know that they gained the system and that intellectually

 it wasn't

 the fulfilling experience they wanted and they also know that an mba

 from a comparable institution would not be a massive intellectual step forward

 so i think what we want to say

 is here's something really novel exciting

 that will

 be intellectually very challenging i i do think the university of austin has to be difficult

 yeah

 um i'd like it to feel a little bit like surviving

 navy seal training to come through this program because it will be intellectually

 you are about the idea of creating a new university because

 heaven

 knows peter and i have been discussing

 this idea for years and he's always

 said well no we thought about this and it just isn't going to work but i

 really think we've got a we got a responsibility

 to to do this well steve's been on this podcast before we've

 spoken

 a few times so i'll send this to him i hope he does

 actually get behind

 it as well

 so i'm i'm super

 excited

 by

 the ideas that we've been talking about that this

 effort represents

 and

 what ripple effect it has on the rest of society

 so thank you that was a time

 beautifully spent and i'm really grateful for the

 the fortune

 of getting a chance to talk to you at this moment in history

 because i've been a big fan of your work

 and the reason i wanted to talk to you today

 is

 about all the excellent books you've written about various aspects of history through money war

 power pandemics all of that but i'm glad that

 this

 we got a chance to talk about this which is

 not looking at history it's looking at the future

 this is a beautiful little

 fortuitous

 moment i appreciate you talking about it

 in the book ascent of money

 you give a history of the world through the lens of money

 if the financial system is evolutionary

 nature

 much like life on earth what is the origin

 of money on earth

 the origin of money

 predates coins

 most people kind of assume i'll talk about coins but coins are relatively late developments

 back in ancient mesopotamia so i don't know 5 000 years ago there were

 relations between creditors and debtors there there are even in the simplest economy

 because of the way in which agriculture works

 hey i need i need to

 plant these seeds but i'm not going to have crops for x months

 so we have clay tablets in which

 simple debt transactions are inscribed

 i remember looking at great numbers of these in the british museum when i was

 writing the ascent of money and that's really

 the beginning of money the minute you start recording

 a relationship between a creditor and a debtor you have something that is quasi money

 and that is probably what these

 um clay tablets mostly denoted

 from that point on

 there's a great evolutionary experiment to see what the most convenient way is

 to record

 relations between creditors and debtors and what emerges

 in the time of the ancient greeks are coins metal tokens

 sometimes

 a valuable metal sometimes not usually bearing the imprint of a state or a monarch

 and

 that's the sort of more familiar

 form of of money that we still use today

 for very very small

 transactions

 i expect coins will

 all be gone by the time

 my youngest

 son is my age but but they're a last remnant of a very very old way

 of of doing

 of doing simple transactions and when you say coins you mean physical coins

 i'm talking about coins has been

 rebranded

 into digital space yeah not coin based coins

 actual

 coin

 coins

 you know the ones that jangle

 in your

 in your pocket

 and you

 kind of

 don't know quite what to do with once you have some

 so

 that that became an incredibly

 pervasive

 form of of of paying for things money's just a it's just a crystallization

 of a relationship between a debtor and a creditor and coins are just very fungible

 you know whereas a clay tablet relates to a specific transaction

 coins are generic and fungible they can be used in in any transaction

 so that was an important evolutionary

 advance

 if you think of financial history and this was the point of the ascent of money

 as an evolutionary

 story there are punctuated equilibria

 people get by with coins for a long time

 despite their defects as a means of payment

 such as that they can be debased

 they can be clipped it's very hard to avoid

 fake or debased money entering the system

 but coinage is still kind of the basis of payments all the way

 through the roman empire out the other end into the so-called

 dark ages it's still how most things are settled

 in cash transactions in the early 1300s

 you don't get a big shift until after the black death

 when there is such

 a need to monetize

 the economy because of chronic labor shortages

 and feudalism

 begins to unravel

 that you you just don't have a sufficient

 amount of coinage and so you get bills of exchange and i'm

 really into bills of exchange

 because and this i hope will capture your listeners and viewers imaginations

 when they start using bills of exchange

 which which are really just pieces of paper saying you know

 i owe you over a three month period while goods are in transit from

 florence to london

 you get the first

 peer-to-peer

 payment system which is network verified

 because they're

 they're not coins they don't have a king's head on them they're just pieces of paper

 and the verification comes in the form of signatures

 and you you need ultimately some kind of guarantee if

 i write an iou

 to you build change i mean you don't really know

 me that well we only just met

 so you might want to get endorsed

 by

 i don't know somebody really credit worthy like elon

 and so we we actually

 can see in the late 14th century in northern italy in

 england and elsewhere

 the evolution of

 a peer-to-peer network system of of payment

 and that's actually how world trade grows because you just couldn't settle

 long oceanic transactions with coinage it just wasn't practical

 all those

 treasure chests full of doubloons which were

 part of the way in which the spanish empire worked really inefficient

 so bills of exchange are an exciting

 part of the story and they illustrate

 something i should have made more clear of the ascent of money

 that not everything used in payment needs to be money

 classically economists will tell you oh well money money has three different functions

 it's you've heard this a zillion times right it's a unit of account

 it's a store of value and it's a medium of exchange

 now there are three

 or four things that are worth saying about this and i'll just say two one

 it may be that those three things are a trilemma

 and it's very difficult

 for anything

 to be all of them

 this point was made by my

 hoover

 colleague manny rincon

 cruz

 last year and i still

 wish he would write this up as a paper

 because it's a great insight

 the second thing that's really interesting to me is that

 payments don't need to be money

 and

 if we go around as economists

 love to do saying well bitcoin's not money because it doesn't fulfill these criteria

 we're missing the point that you could build a system of payments

 which i think is how we should think about crypto that is

 isn't money doesn't need to be money it's like bills of exchange it's network-based

 verification

 peer-to-peer transactions without without third-party verification

 when it hit me the other day that we actually had this precedent

 for crypto

 i got quite excited

 and thought

 i wish i had written that in the ascent of money

 can you sort of from a first principles like almost like a physics perspective

 or maybe a human perspective

 describe where does the value of money come from like where is it actually

 where is it so it's a sheet of paper or it's coins

 but

 it feels like in a platonic

 sense

 there's some kind of thing that's actually

 storing

 the value

 as us a bunch of ants are dancing around and so on

 i come from a family of physicists

 i'm the black sheep of the family my mother's a physicist my sister is

 and so when you ask me to explain something in physics terms i

 i get a kind of little part of me dies because i know i'll fail

 but in in truth it doesn't really matter what we decide

 money is going to be and anything can record

 crystallize the the relationship between the the creditor and the debtor

 it could be a piece of paper it can be a piece of metal

 it can be nothing can just be a digital

 entry

 it's

 trust that we're really talking about here

 we are not just trusting one another we may not but we are trusting the money

 so whatever we use to represent

 the credited debtor relationship whether it's a banknote or a coin or whatever

 it does depend on us both trusting it

 and that doesn't always pertain

 what we see in episodes of inflation

 especially episodes of hyperinflation

 is a crisis of trust a crisis of confidence in

 the means of payments

 and this is very traumatic for the societies to which it happens

 by and large human beings particularly once you have a rule of law

 system of the sort that evolved in the west and then became generalized

 are predisposed to trust one another

 and the default setting is to trust money

 even when it depreciates a quite steady rate as the us dollar has done

 pretty much uninterruptedly since the 1960s

 it takes quite a big disruption for money to lose that trust

 but i think essentially what money should be thought of as

 is a series

 of tokens that can take any form we like

 and can be purely digital

 which represent our transactions as as creditors and debtors

 and the whole thing depends on our collective trust to work

 i had to explain this to stephen colbert once in the

 call burster the old old show that was actually funny and

 when he said

 um

 so so so neil could i be money and i said yes you know we could

 we could settle

 a debt with a human being that was quite common

 in much of history but but it's not the most convenient

 form of money

 money has to be convenient

 that's why when they worked out how to make payments with cell phones the chinese

 simply

 went straight there from bank accounts

 they skipped out credit cards you won't see credit cards in china

 except in the hands of naive tourists

 how much can this trust

 bear

 in terms of

 us humans with our human nature testing it

 it seems that i guess the surprising thing is the thing works

 a bunch of self-interested ants running around

 trading in trust

 and it seems to work except for

 a bunch of moments in human history when there's hyperinflation like you mentioned and it's just

 it's just kind of amazing

 it's kind of amazing that us humans if i were to be optimistic

 and sort of hopeful about human nature

 it gives me a sense that

 people want to lean on each other they want to trust

 that certainly

 i would say probably now a widely shared view amongst evolutionary psychologists

 network scientists it's one of nicholas christakis's argument in a recent book

 and i think economic history broadly bears this out but you have to be

 cautious

 the cases where the system works

 are familiar to us

 because those are the those are the

 the states and the eras that produce a lot of written records

 but when

 the system of trust collapses

 and the monetary system collapses with it there's generally quite a paucity

 of of records i found that when i was

 writing

 doom and so we slightly are biased in favor of the periods when trust

 prevailed and the system functioned

 it's very easy to point to a great many episodes

 of very very intense monetary chaos even in the relatively recent past

 in the wake of the first world war

 multiple currencies not just the german currency multiple currencies

 were completely destroyed the russian currency the polish currency

 there were currency disasters all over

 central and eastern europe in the early 1920s

 and that was partly because

 over the course of the 19th century a system had evolved in which trust

 was based

 on gold

 and rules that were supposedly

 applied by central banks

 that system

 which produced relative price stability over the the 19th century

 fell apart

 as a result of the first world war and

 and as soon as it was gone

 as soon as there was no longer a

 clear link between

 those

 banknotes and coins and gold the whole thing went completely haywire

 and i think we should remember that the extent of the monetary chaos from certainly 1918

 all the way through to the late 1940s

 i mean the german currency was destroyed not once but twice

 in that period and that was one of the most advanced economies in the world

 in the united states there were periods of intensely

 deep deflation prices fell by a third

 in the great depression and then very serious price volatility

 in the immediate post-world war ii period so

 it's a bit of an illusion

 maybe it's an illusion

 for people who've spent most of their lives in the last 20 years

 we've had a period of exceptional price stability

 since this century began

 in which a regime of central bank independence and inflation targeting appeared to generate

 steady below 2

 inflation

 in much of the developed world was a bit too low for the central bankers liking

 and that became a problem in the financial crisis

 but we've avoided

 major price

 instability

 for

 the better

 part

 of 20 years

 in most of the world there haven't really been that many

 very high inflation episodes and hardly any hyperinflationary

 episodes venezuela is one of the very few zimbabwes another

 but if you take a hundred year view or a 200

 in most of the world there haven't really been that many

 very high inflation episodes and hardly any hyperinflationary

 episodes venezuela is one of the very few zimbabwes another

 but if you take a hundred year view or a 200

 year view or if you want to take a 500

 year view

 you realize that

 quite often the system doesn't work

 if you go back to the 17th century there were multiple competing

 systems of coinage there had been a great inflation that had begun the previous century

 the price revolution caused mainly by the arrival of new world silver

 i think financial history is a bit messier than one might think and

 the more one studies it the more one realizes that the need for the evolution

 the reason bills of exchange came along was because the coinage systems had stopped working

 the reason that banknotes

 started to become

 used

 more generally

 first in

 the american

 colonies

 in the 17th

 century

 then more widely

 in the 18th century

 was just that they were

 more convenient

 than

 any other way of of paying for things we had to invent the bond market

 in the 18th

 century

 to cope with the problem

 of public

 debt

 which

 up until

 that point had been a recurrent

 source

 of

 instability

 and then we invented equity finance

 because bonds were not enough

 so i would prefer to think of

 of the financial history as a series of crises really that are resolved by innovations

 and in the most recent episode very exciting episode of financial history something called bitcoin

 initiated a new financial or monetary revolution in response i think to the growing

 crisis of the fiat money system can you speak to that so

 what do you think about bitcoin

 what do you think it is the response

 to what are the growing problems of the fiat system

 what is this moment in human history

 that is full of challenges that bitcoin and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome

 i don't think bitcoin

 was devised by satoshi whoever he was for fear of

 a breakdown of the fiat currencies

 if it was it was a very far-sighted enterprise because certainly in 2008

 when the first bitcoin paper appeared it wasn't very likely that

 a wave of inflation was coming if anything

 there was more reason to fear deflation at that point i think

 it would be more accurate to say

 that with the advent of the internet

 there was a need for a means of payment native to the internet

 typing your credit card number into a random website it's not the way

 to pay for things on the internet

 and i'd rather think of bitcoin as the first iteration

 the first attempt to solve the problem of how do we pay for things in

 what we must learn to call the metaverse

 but

 let's just call it the internet for old times sake

 and ever since that initial

 innovation the realization that you could use computing power and cryptography to create

 peer-to-peer payments without third-party verification

 a revolution has been gathering momentum

 that poses a very profound

 threat to the existing legacy system of banks and and fiat currencies

 most money in the world today is made by banks not central banks banks

 that's what most money is it's entries in bank accounts

 and

 what bitcoin represents is an alternative mode of payment that really ought to render banks obsolete

 i think this financial revolution

 has

 got past the point at which it can be killed

 it was vulnerable in the early years

 but it now has sufficient adoption

 and has generated sufficient

 additional layers

 i mean ethereum

 was in many ways the more important

 innovation because you can build a whole

 system of of payments and ultimately smart contracts on top of ether

 i think we've now reached the point that it's

 pretty hard to imagine it all being killed

 and it's just survived an amazing thing which was the chinese

 shutting down mining and shutting down everything and still here we are

 in fact crypto's thriving

 what we don't know is how much damage

 ill-judged

 regulatory interventions are going to do to this financial revolution

 left to its own devices i think decentralized finance provides the native

 monitoring financial system for the internet

 and

 the more time we spend in

 the metaverse

 the more

 use

 we

 will make of it

 the next

 things

 that will happen

 i think will be that

 tokens in game spaces like roblox will become fungible

 as my nine-year-old spends a lot more time playing on

 computer games than i ever did i can see the entertainment

 is becoming

 a game-driven phenomenon and in the game space you need skins for your avatar

 the economics of the internet

 it's evolving very fast and in parallel you can see this payments

 revolution happening i think that all

 that all goes naturally

 very well and generates an enormous amount of wealth in the process

 the the problem is

 there are people in washington with an overwhelming urge to intervene and and disrupt this evolutionary

 process

 partly i think

 out of a muddled sense that there must be a lot of nefarious things going on

 if we don't step in many more will go on this i think greatly exaggerates

 how much

 criminal activity is in fact going on in the space

 but there's also the vested interests at work it was odd to me

 maybe not odd

 perhaps it wasn't surprising but the bank for international settlements earlier this year published

 a report

 one chapter of which said this must all go let's all stop

 it's all got to be shut down

 and it's got to be replaced by central bank digital currency

 and martin wolf in the financial times read this and said i agree with this

 and one suddenly realized that the the banks are clever they had they'd achieved the intellectual

 counter-attack

 with almost no fingerprints on the weapon

 i think central bank digital currency is a terrible idea

 i can't imagine why we would want to copy a chinese

 model that essentially takes all transactions

 and puts them directly under the surveillance of a central government institution but

 that suddenly is a serious counterproposal

 so on the one side we have a relatively decentralized

 technologically

 innovative

 internet native

 system of payments that has the possibility to evolve to produce a full set of

 of smart contracts

 reducing enormously

 the transaction

 costs

 that we currently

 encounter

 in the financial

 world because it gets rid of all those middlemen

 who take their cut every time

 you take out a mortgage or whatever it is that's one

 alternative

 on the other side we have a highly centralized

 system in which transactions

 will by default be under the surveillance of the central bank

 seems like an easy choice to me but hey i have this thing about personal liberty

 so that's where we are i don't think that the regulators can can kill

 web 3 i think we're supposed to call it web 3 because crypto

 is now an obsolescent

 term

 they can't kill it but they can definitely make it difficult

 and

 throw a lot of sand into the machine

 and i think worst of all they can spoil the evolutionary story by

 by creating central bank digital currency that i don't think we really need or

 we certainly don't need it in the chinese form

 but do you think bitcoin has a strong chance to take over the world so

 become the primary you mentioned the three things that make money money

 become the primary methodology by which we store wealth we exchange no

 no i think what bitcoin is

 this was a phrase that i i got from my friend matt mclennan

 first eagle an option on digital gold so it's the gold of the system

 but currently it behaves like an option

 that's why it's quite volatile because we don't really know if this brave new world of

 crypto is gonna work

 but if it does work then bitcoin is the gold because of the finite supply

 what role

 we need gold to play in the metaverse isn't quite

 clear

 i love that you're using the term metaverse this is great

 well i i just like the metaversity

 as a kind of yeah

 as the antithesis of what we're trying to do in in austin but

 i love it but can you imagine i'm using it sarcastically

 i come from glasgow where all novel words have to be used sarcastically so the metaverse

 sarcastic but see the beauty about humor and sarcasm is that the joke becomes reality

 i mean it's like using

 the word big bang to describe the origins of the universe

 it becomes like that

 it will

 after a while it's in the textbooks

 yeah and nobody's laughing

 yeah well that's exactly right so sticky

 yeah

 um i'm on the side of humor but it is a it is a dangerous

 activity

 these days

 anyway

 i think bitcoin is is the option of digital gold

 the

 the role it plays is probably

 not so much storage value

 right now it's just nicely not very correlated

 asset in your portfolio

 when i updated the ascent of money which was in 2018

 10 years after it came out

 i wrote a new chapter in which i said

 bitcoin which had just sold off after its 2017 bubble will rise again through adoption

 because if every millionaire in the world

 has point two percent of his or her wealth

 in bitcoin

 the price

 should be fifteen thousand dollars and if it's one percent it's seventy five thousand dollars

 and it

 might not even stay at one percent because i mean look at its recent performance

 if you

 if your exposure to stocks global stocks had been hedged with a significant

 crypto holding you would have aced the last few months

 so i think the non-correlation [music]

 property is very very important in driving

 adoption and the volatility also drives adoption if you're a sophisticated investor

 so i think the adoption drives

 bitcoin up

 because it's the option of digital gold but it's also just this nicely not very correlated

 asset that you want to hold

 in

 in a world where

 the hell i mean

 the bank central bank is going to tighten we've come through this massively disruptive

 episode of the pandemic

 public debt soared

 money printing sword

 you could hang around with your bonds and wait for the euthanasia

 of the rontier

 you can hang on to your tech stocks and just hope there isn't a massive correction

 or

 dot dot dot well and

 it seems like a fairly obvious strategy

 to make sure that you have at least some crypto

 for the coming year given what we likely have to face

 i think what's really interesting is that on top of ethereum

 a more elaborate

 financial system is being built

 stable coins are the interesting

 puzzle for me because we need off-ramps

 you and i have to pay taxes in u.s dollars

 and

 there's no getting away from that

 the irs is going to let us hold crypto as long as we pay our taxes

 and the only question in my mind is what's the optimal off-ramp

 to make those taxes make those tax payments

 probably it shouldn't be a currency invented by facebook

 never struck me as the best solution to this problem

 maybe it's some kind of fed coin

 or maybe one of the the existing algorithmic

 stable coins does the job but we clearly need some stable off-ramp

 so you don't think it's possible for the irs

 within the next decade to be accepting bitcoin as tax payments

 i doubt that

 having dealt with the irs now since when did i first come here 2002

 it's hard to think of an institution less likely to leap into the

 21st century when it comes to to payments no i think i think we'll we'll be

 we'll be tolerated

 crypto world will be tolerated

 as long as we pay our taxes

 that's the and it's important

 that we're already at that point

 and then the next question becomes well

 does gary gensler define everything as a security and do we then have to go through

 endless regulatory contortions to satisfy the sec

 there's a whole bunch of of uncertainties

 that the administrative

 state excels at creating because you know that's just how that's how the administrative

 state works you'll do something new hmm

 i'll decide whether that's a security

 but don't expect me to define

 it for you i'll decide

 in an arbitrary

 way and then you'll owe me money

 so all of this is going to be very annoying

 and you know for people who are trying to run

 exchanges

 or

 innovate in the space these these regulations

 will be annoying but the problem with fintech is it's it's different from tech broadly defined

 you know when tech got into

 e-commerce with amazon when it got into social networking with facebook

 there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to navigate

 but welcome to the world of finance which has always been

 a jungle of regulation because the regulation is is there to you know basically

 entrench the incumbents that's what it's for

 so it'll be a much tougher fight than the fights we've we've seen over

 other aspects of the tech revolution because because the incumbents are are there and they see

 the threat

 and in the end

 satoshi said it very explicitly

 it's peer-to-peer payment without third party verification and all the third parties are going wait what

 we're the third parties

 so there is a connection between power and money

 you've mentioned world war one from the perspective of money so power money war authoritarian regimes

 from the perspective of money do you have hope that cryptocurrency

 can help resist war can help

 resist the negative effects of authoritarian regimes

 or is that a silly hope

 wars happen because the people who have the power to command armed forces

 miscalculate that's generally what happens

# Chapter 7

 e-commerce with amazon when it got into social networking with facebook

 from the perspective of money do you have hope that cryptocurrency

 can help resist war can help

 resist the negative effects of authoritarian regimes

 or is that a silly hope

 wars happen because the people who have the power to command armed forces

 miscalculate that's generally what happens

 and we will have a big war in the near future if

 both the chinese government and the us government miscalculates

 and they unleash lethal lethal force on one another and there's nothing that any financial institution

 can do to stop that

 any more than the rothschilds could rothschilds could stop world war one

 and they were then the biggest bank in the world by far with massive

 international financial influence

 so let's accept that war is is in a different domain

 war

 would impact the financial world massively

 if it were a war between the united states and china because

 there's still a huge china trade on wall street is long china europe is long china

 so the conflict that i could foresee in the future is one that's highly financially disruptive

 where does crypto fit in crypto's obvious

 utility in the short run

 is as a store of wealth of transferable wealth for people who live

 in dangerous places

 with

 failing not just failing money but failing rule of law

 that's why in latin america

 there's so much

 interest

 in crypto

 because latin

 americans

 have a lot of monetary

 history

 to look back on and not much of it is

 so i think that the short run problem that crypto solves

 is and this goes back to the the digital gold point

 if you are in a dangerous place with weak rule of law and weak property rights

 here's a new and better way to have portable wealth

 i think the next

 question to ask is would you want to be long crypto

 in the event of world war three

 what's interesting about that question is that world war three would likely have a significant

 cyber dimension to it

 and i don't want to be a hundred percent in crypto if they crash the internet

 which between them china and russia might be able to do

 that's a fascinating question whether you want to be holding

 physical gold or digital gold

 in the event of world war iii

 the smart person who studied history

 definitely

 wants

 better both

 and

 so let's imagine world war iii has a very very severe

 cyber component to it with high levels of disruption

 yeah you'd be glad of the old the old shiny stuff at that point so

 diversification still seems like the most important

 truth

 of a financial history

 yeah and and what is crypto it's just this wonderful new source of diversification

 but you'd be nuts to be a hundred percent in bitcoin

 i mean i i i have

 some friends who are

 probably

 quite close to that close to 100

 i i'd marr the i'd mar the bowls of steel

 yeah in whatever way that balls of steel takes to takes form

 you mentioned smart contracts what are your thoughts about

 in the context of the history of money about ethereum about smart contracts about kind of

 more systematic at scale formalization of agreements between humans i think

 it must be the case that a lot of the complexity in a mortgage is redundant

 that when we are confronted with pages and pages and pages and pages of small prints

 we're seeing some manifestation of of the late stage regulatory state

 the transaction itself is quite simple

 and most of the verbage is just ass covering by regulators

 so i think the smart contract

 although

 i'm sure lawyers will

 email me and tell me i'm wrong

 can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla and maybe not so plain transactions

 that we want to do

 and eliminate

 yet more intermediaries

 that's my my kind of working assumption and

 given that a lot of of financial transactions

 have the potential at least to be to be simplified automated

 turned into smart contracts that that's probably where the future goes

 i can't see an obvious reason why my

 range of different financial

 needs let's think about insurance for example will continue to be met

 with instruments that in some ways are 100 years old

 so i think we're still

 an early stage of a financial revolution that will greatly streamline

 how we take care of all those financial needs that we have

 mortgages and insurance leave leap to mind you know most households are are penalized

 for being financially poorly educated and confronted with oligopolistic

 financial services providers so you kind of leave college already in debt so you start

 in debt servitude

 and then

 you gotta somehow

 leave her up to buy a

 home if you can because everybody's kind of telling you you should do that so

 so you and your spouse

 you are getting even more leveraged

 and you're

 you're long one asset class called real estate which is super illiquid

 i mean already i'm i'm crying inside at the thought of

 describing

 so many households

 financial

 predicament

 in that way and i'm not done with them yet because oh by the way

 there's all this insurance you have to take out

 and here are the providers

 that are willing to insure you and here are the premiums

 you're going to be paying

 which are kind of presented

 to you that's your that's your car insurance

 that's your home insurance

 and if you're here it's the earthquake

 insurance and

 pretty soon you're just bleeding

 money

 in a bunch of monthly payments to the mortgage

 lender to the insurer

 to all the other people that lent you money

 and let's look at your balance sheet it sucks

 you know

 there's this great big chunk

 of real estate

 and what else have you really got on there

 and the other side is a bunch of debt which is probably paying too high interest

 the typical household in the median

 kind of range is is at the mercy of

 oligopolistic financial services providers go down further in the social

 scale and people are outside the financial system altogether

 and those poor folks have to rely on

 banknotes and informal lending with huge punitive rates

 we have to do better than this this has to be

 this has to be improved upon

 and i think what's exciting about our time is that technology

 now exists that didn't exist when i wrote the ascent of money

 to solve these problems when i wrote this under money which was in 2008

 you couldn't really solve the problem i've just described

 certainly you couldn't solve it with something like microfinance that was obviously not viable the

 interest rates were high the transaction costs were crazy

 but now we have solutions

 and the solutions are extremely

 exciting so fintech is this great force for good that

 brings people into the financial system

 and reduces transaction costs

 crypto is part of it but it's just part of it there's a much broader

 story of fintech going on here where

 you get suddenly you get financial services

 on your phone

 don't cost nearly as much as they

 they did when there had to be a bricks and mortar

 building

 on main street

 that you kind of went

 humbly

 and beseeched

 to lend you money i'm excited about that because it seems to me very socially transformative

 i'll give you one other example of what's great

 the people who really get sculpt in our financial system are senders and receivers of remittances

 which are often amongst the poorest families in the world the people who are

 like my wife's family in east africa really kind of hand to mouth

 and if you send money to east africa or

 the philippines

 or central america

 it's it's the transaction

 costs are awful

 i'm talking to you western union

 we're gonna solve that problem

 so ten years from now the transaction cost will just be negligible

 and the money will go to the people who need it rather than to

 rent seeking financial

 institutions

 so i'm on the side of the revolution

 with this because

 i think the incumbent financial institutions globally

 are doing a pretty terrible job

 and

 middle class and lower class families lose out and

 thankfully technology

 technology allows us to fix this yeah so fintech can remove a lot of inefficiencies

 in the system

 i'm super excited myself maybe as a machine learning person in the data oracles

 so converting a lot of our physical world into data

 so

 and have smart contracts on top of that so

 that no longer is there's this fuzziness

 about

 what is the concrete nature of the agreements

 you can tie your agreement to weather you can tie your agreement to

 the behavior of

 certain kinds of financial

 systems you can tie your behavior to i don't know

 i mean all kinds of things you can connect it to the body

 in terms of human

 um sensory information

 like

 you can make an agreement that if you don't lose five pounds in the next month

 you're going to pay me a thousand dollars or something like that i don't know

 it's a stupid example

 but it's not

 because like you can create all kinds of services

 on top of that you can

 you can just create

 all kinds of interesting applications

 that completely revolutionize

 how humans transact

 i think

 of course we don't want to create a world of chinese style social credit

 in which our behavior

 becomes so transparent

 to providers of financial services particularly insurers that

 when i try to go into the pub i'm i'm stopped from doing so

 every time you take a drink your insurance goes up

 right or my credit card won't work

 in certain restaurants because they serve

 you know ribeye steak

 i fear that world because i see it being built in china and

 we we must at all costs make sure that the western world has something

 distinctive to offer

 it can't just be oh it's the same as in china only the data go to

 to five tech companies rather than to

 xi jinping so i think the the way we need to steer this world is

 in the way that our data

 are by default vaulted on our devices

 and we choose

 when to release the data yes

 rather than the default setting being that the data are available

 that's important i think because it was one of the biggest mistakes

 of

 the evolution of the internet that

 that in a way the default was to let our our data be plundered

 it's hard to undo that but i think we can we can at least

 create a new regime

 that in future makes privacy default rather than open access default

 in the book doom the politics of catastrophe

 your newest book you describe wars pandemics and the terrible disasters in human history

 which stands out to you as the worst in terms of how much

 it shook the world and the human spirit

 i am glad i was not around

 in the mid 14th century when the bubonic plague swept across eurasia

 as far as we can see that was history's worst pandemic

 maybe there was a comparably bad one in the reign of the emperor justinian but

 there's some reason to think it wasn't as bad

 and the more we learn about

 the 14th century with the more we realized that it really was across eurasia

 and the the mortality

 was

 30

 in some places 50

 in some places higher there were whole towns that were just emptied

 and when one reads about the black death it's an unimaginable

 nightmare of of death and

 madness in the death with flagellate orders wandering from town to town

 seeking to ward off divine retribution by flogging themselves

 people turning on the local jewish communities as if it's somehow their fault

 that must have been a nightmarish

 time

 if you ask me

 for an an also ran a runner-up it would be it would be world war ii

 in eastern europe and in many ways

 it might have been worse because for a medieval

 peasant the sense of being on the wrong side of divine retribution must have been overpowering

 in the mid-20th century

 you knew that this was man-made

 murder on a massive industrial scale

 if only if one reads grossman's life and fate just to take one example

 one enters a a hellscape

 that it's extremely hard

 to imagine oneself in

 so these are two of the great disasters of of human history and

 if we did have a time machine if one really were able to transport

 people back and

 and give them a glimpse of these

 times

 i think the post-traumatic

 stress would be enormous

 people would come back from those those trips even if it was a

 one-day excursion

 with guaranteed survival

 in a state of of utter shock

 you often explore counterfactual

 hypothetical

 history this which is a fascinating thing to do

 sometimes to a controversial degree

 and again you walk through that fire gracefully

 so let me ask maybe about

 world war ii or in general or what key moments in history of the 20th century

# Chapter 8

 that it's extremely hard

 to imagine oneself in

 so these are two of the great disasters of of human history and

 if we did have a time machine if one really were able to transport

 and again you walk through that fire gracefully

 so let me ask maybe about

 world war ii or in general or what key moments in history of the 20th century

 do you think

 if something else happened at those moments we could have avoided some of the big atrocities

 stalin's holomore hitler's holocaust miles great chinese famine

 the great turning point in in world history is is august the 2nd 1914

 when the british cabinet decides to intervene

 and what would have been a european war

 becomes a world war

 and with british intervention it becomes a massively larger and more protracted conflict

 so very early in my career i became very preoccupied with the deliberations on that day

 and the surprising

 decision that a liberal cabinet took to to go to war

 which you might not have bet on that morning because

 there seemed to be a majority of cabinet members who would be disinclined

 and only a minority including winston church

 who wanted to go to war so that's one turning point i often wish i could

 get my time machine working and go back and say wait stop

 just think about what you're going to do and by the way

 let me show you a video of europe

 in 1918 so that's one can we linger on that one

 that one

 a lot of people push back on you on in the because it's so difficult

 so the idea is if i could try to summarize

 and

 you're the first person that made me think about this very uncomfortable

 thought which is

 the ideas in world war one

 it would be a better world if britain stayed out of the war

 and germany won right

 thinking now in retrospect that the whole story of the 20th century thinking about

 stalin's rule of 30 years thinking about hitler's rise to power and

 the atrocities of the holocaust but also like you said on the eastern front

 the death of tens of millions of people

 through the war

 and also sort of the political

 prisoners and the suffering connected to communism connected to fascism all those kinds of things

 well that's one

 that's one heck of an example of why you're just like fearless in this

 particular style of exploring counterfactual history so can you elaborate on that

 idea and maybe why this was such an important day in human history

 this argument

 was central

 to my book the pity

 of war

 i

 i also

 did an essay

 in virtual

 history

 about

 this

 and it's always

 amused

 me that

 from around that time i began to be called a conservative

 historian

 because it's actually a very left-wing argument

 the people in 1914

 who thought britain should stay at the war were the left of the labour party

 who split to become the independent labour party

 what would have happened well first of all britain was not ready for war in 1914

 there had not been conscription the army was tiny

 so britain had failed to deter germany the germans took the decision that they could risk

 going through belgium

 using the schlieffen plan to fight their two-front war

 they they calculated that britain's intervention would either not happen or not matter

 if britain had been strategically

 committed

 to preventing

 germany winning a war in europe they should have introduced conscription 10 years before

 had a

 meaningful land army and that would have deterred the germans

 so the liberal government

 provided the worst of both worlds a commitment that was more or less secret to intervene

 that the public didn't know about

 in fact much of the liberal party didn't know about

 but without really the means

 to make that intervention

 effective a tiny army with just a few divisions

 so it's perfectly reasonable to argue as a number of people did in

 on august the 2nd 1914 that britain should not intervene

 after britain had not immediately intervened against the french revolutionary armies

 back in the 1790s

 it had played an offshore role ultimately intervening but not immediately intervening

 if britain had stayed out

 i don't think that france would have collapsed immediately as it had in 1870

 the french held up remarkably well to catastrophic

 casualties in the first six months of the first world war

 but by 1916 i don't see how

 france could have kept going if britain had not joined the war

 and i think the war would have been over perhaps at some point in 1916.

 we know that germany's aims would have been significantly

 limited

 because

 they would have needed to keep britain out if they'd succeeded

 in keeping britain out they'd have had to keep britain out

 and the way to keep britain out was obviously

 not to make any

 annexation

 of belgium to limit german war aims

 particularly to limit them to eastern europe

 and from britain's point of view what was not to like

 so the russian empire is defeated along with france

 what does that really change

 if the germans are sensible

 and we can see what this might have looked like they focus on eastern europe

 they take chunks of the russian empire perhaps they create as they did in the

 in the piece of brest-litovsk

 an independent or quasi-independent

 poland

 in no way does that pose a threat to the british empire in fact

 it's a good thing

 britain never had had a particularly good relationship with the russian empire after all

 the key point here is that the germany that emerges from victory in 1916

 has a kind of european union it's the dominant part of an enlarged

 germany with a significant missile europa

 whatever you want to call it customs union type arrangement with neighboring countries

 including one suspects austria-hungary

 that is a very different world

 from the world of 1917-18 the protraction of the war for a further two years

 its globalization which britain's intervention made inevitable

 as philip zeliko showed in his recent book on the failure to make peace in 1916

 woodrow wilson tried and failed to intervene and broker a piece in 1916

 so i'm not the only

 counterfactualist

 here the extension of the war for a further two years with escalating

 slaughter the death toll rose because the industrial capacity of the armies grew greater

 that's what condemns us to the bolshevik revolution

 and it's what condemns us ultimately to nazism

 because it's out of

 the experience of defeat in 1918

 as hitler makes clear in mind camp that he becomes radicalized and enters the political realm

 take out those additional years of war and hitler's just a failed artist

 it's the it's the end of the war

 that turns him into

 the demagogue

 you asked what are the things that evolve avoid the totalitarian states

 as i've said british

 intervention for me is the most plausible

 and it takes out all of that malignant history that follows from the bolshevik revolution

 it's very hard for me to see how lenin gets anywhere if the war is over

 that looks like the opportunity for the the constitutional

 elements the liberal elements in in russia

 there are other moments at which you can imagine history taking a different path

 if the provisional government in russia had been more ruthless

 it was very lenient towards the bolsheviks

 but if it had just rounded them up and shot the bolshevik leadership

 that would have certainly

 cut the bolshevik revolution off

 one looks back on the

 conduct of the the russian liberals with the kind of despair

 at their

 their failure to see the scale of the threat that they face and the ruthlessness

 that the bolshevik leadership would evince

 there's a counterfactual in germany which is interesting

 i think the weimar republic destroyed itself in two disastrous economic

 calamities the inflation and then the deflation

 it's difficult for me to imagine hitler getting to be

 reich chancellor without those huge economic disasters

 so another part of my early work explored alternative

 policy options that the german republic the weimar republic might have pursued

 there are other contingencies

 that that spring to mind in 1936

 or 38 i think more plausibly 38

 britain should have gone to war the great mistake was munich

 hitler was in an extremely vulnerable position in 1938

 because remember he didn't have russia squared away as he would in 1939.

 chamberlain's mistake was to fold instead of

 of going for going for war as church or rightly saw

 and and that there was a magical opportunity

 there

 that would have played into the hands of the german military opposition and conservatives

 to to snuff hitler out

 over czechoslovakia

 i could go on the point is that the history is not some inexorable narrative

 which can only end one way it's a garden of forking paths and at

 many many junctions in the road

 there were choices

 that could have averted the

 calamities of the mid-20th century i have to ask you about this moment

 before you said i could go on this moment of chamberlain and hitler snuff hitler out

 in terms of czechoslovakia

 and

 we'll return to

 the book doom

 on this point what does it take to be a great

 leader

 in the room with hitler or

 in the same time and space as hitler

 to snuff him out to make the right decisions

 what what

 is

 so it sounds like you put quite a bit of the blame

 on the man

 chamberlain and give credit

 to somebody like a churchill so what is the difference where's that line you've also

 written a book about henry kissinger who's an interesting sort of person that's been through

 throughout many difficult

 decisions in the games of power

 so what does it take to be a great leader in that moment

 that particular

 moment sorry to keep talking

 is fascinating

 to me because it feels like it's man on man conversations

 that define history well hitler was bluffing

 he really wasn't ready for war in 1938

 the german economy was clearly not ready for war in 1938

 and and chamberlain made a fundamental

 miscalculation along with his advisors because it wasn't all chamberlain he was in many ways articulating

 the establishment

 view

 and i tried to show in a book called war of the world how that establishment

 worked it extended

 through the bbc into the aristocracy

 to oxford there was an establishment view chamberlain personified it churchill was seen as a warmonger

 he was at his lowest point of popularity in 1938

 but what is what is it that chamberlain gets wrong because it's conceptual

 chamberlain

 is persuaded

 that britain has to play for time because britain is not ready for war in 1938.

 he fails to see that the time that he gets

 that he buys at munich is also available to hitler

 everybody gets the time

 and hitler's able to do much more with it because hitler strikes the pact with

 with stalin

 that guarantees that germany can fight a war on one front in 1939.

 what does chamberlain do builds some more aircraft

 so the great mistake of the strategy of appeasement

 was to play for time

 i mean they knew all was coming but they were playing for time not realizing

 that

 hitler got the time too

 and after he partitioned czechoslovakia

 he was in a much stronger position not least because of all the resources that

 they were able to plunder

 from czechoslovakia

 so that was the conceptual mistake churchill played an heroic role in pointing out

 this mistake and predicting accurately that it would lead to war on worse terms

 what does it take it takes a distinct courage

 to be unpopular

 and churchill was deeply unpopular

 at that point people would listen to him

 in the house of commons

 in silence

 on one occasion

 lady astor shouted rubbish

 so he went through a period of being hated on

 the other thing that made churchill

 a formidable leader was that he always applied history to the problem

 and that's why he gets it right he he sees the historical

 problem much more clearly than than chamberlain

 so i think

 if you go back to 1938

 there's no realistic counterfactual in which churchill's in government in 1938

 you have to france collapse for churchill to come into government

 but you can certainly imagine

 a tory elite

 that's thinking more clearly about the likely dynamics

 they haven't seen this

 i guess problem of conjecture to take a phrase from kissinger

 which is that whatever they're doing in postponing

 the war has the potential to create a worse starting point for the war

 it would have been risky in 1938

 but it was a way better situation than they ended up with in 1939

 a year later

 you asked about kissinger and i've learnt a lot from reading kissinger

 and talking to kissinger since i embarked on writing his biography

 a great many years ago

 i think one of the most important things i've learned

 is that

 you can apply history to contemporary problems it may be the most important

 tool that we have in that kind of decision making

 you have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously

 and in the moment of crisis you have to take risk so

 kissinger often says

 in his early work

 the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data

 but ultimately the decision making that we do under uncertainty can't be based on data

# Chapter 9

 they haven't seen this

 i guess problem of conjecture to take a phrase from kissinger

 which is that whatever they're doing in postponing

 the war has the potential to create a worse starting point for the war

 it would have been risky in 1938

 but it was a way better situation than they ended up with in 1939

 a year later

 you asked about kissinger and i've learnt a lot from reading kissinger

 and talking to kissinger since i embarked on writing his biography

 a great many years ago

 i think one of the most important things i've learned

 is that

 you can apply history to contemporary problems it may be the most important

 you have to do it quite ruthlessly and rigorously

 and in the moment of crisis you have to take risk so

 kissinger often says

 in his early work

 the temptation of the bureaucrat is to wait for more data

 but ultimately the decision making that we do under uncertainty can't be based on data

 the problem of conjecture is that you could take an action now and incur some cost

 an avert disaster

 but you'll get no thanks for it because nobody is grateful for an averted disaster

 and nobody goes around saying wasn't it wonderful how we didn't have another 911

 on the other hand you can do nothing

 incur no upfront costs and hope for the best

 and you might get lucky the disaster might not happen

 that's in a democratic system the much easier path to take

 and i think the the essence of leadership is to be ready

 to take that upfront cost avert the disaster and accept that you won't get gratitude

 if i may make a comment

 an aside about henry kissinger so he i think at 98 years old currently

 has still got it yeah he's brilliant

 it's very very impressive i

 can only hope that my brain has the same

 durability

 that his his does because it's a formidable intellect and it's still in

 in as sharp form as it it was 50 years ago

 so you mentioned eric schmidt's

 in his book

 they reached out to me didn't want to do this podcast

 and i'm i'm

 i know eric schmidt i've spoken to him before i like him a lot obviously

 um so they said

 we could do a podcast for 40 minutes with eric

 40 minutes with eric and henry together

 and 40 minutes with henry so those are three different conversations

 and i had to like i had to do some soul searching

 because i said fine 40 minutes with eric we'll probably talk many times again

 fine let's talk about this ai book together for 40 minutes

 but i said what i wrote to them said i would hate myself

 if i only have 40 minutes to talk to henry kissinger

 as i had to hold my ground went back and forth and in the end decided

 to part ways over this and i sometimes think about this kind of

 difficult decision

 um in the podcasting space of when do you walk away because

 um there's a particular world leader

 that i've mentioned in the past where the conversation is very likely to happen

 and

 as as it happens

 those conversations can often be

 you know unfortunately

 this person only has 30 minutes now i know we agreed for three hours but unfortunately

 and you have to decide

 do i stand my ground on this

 on this point i suppose that's the thing that journalists

 have to think about right like um

 do i hold on to my integrity

 in whatever form that takes and do i stay in my ground even if i

 lose a fascinating opportunity

 anyway it's something i thought i thought about and

 something i think about and with henry kissinger

 i mean

 he's had a million amazing conversations

 in your biography

 so it's not like something is lost but it was still nevertheless

 to me some soul searching they had to do as a as a kind of practice

 for

 what to me is a higher stakes conversation i'll just mention is vladimir putin

 i can have a conversation with him unlike any conversation he's ever had

 partially because i'm a fluent russian speaker

 partially

 because

 i'm messed

 up in the head in certain kind of ways that make for an interesting

 dynamic

 because we're both judo people we both are

 certain kinds of human beings that can have a much deeper apolitical conversation

 i have to ask to stay on the topic of leadership

 you've in your book doom have talked about wars pandemics throughout human history

 and in some sense saying that all of these disasters are man-made

 so humans have a role in terms of the magnitude

 of the effect that they have on human civilization

 without taking cheap political shots can we talk about covid19

 how will

 history remember the coven 19 pandemic what were the successes with what were the failures

 of leadership

 of of man of humans

 doom was a book

 that i was

 planning to write before

 yes the pandemic struck

 as a history of of the future based in large measure on science fiction

 it had occurred to me in 2019

 that i had spent too long not reading science fiction and so i decided i would

 liven up my my intake

 by getting off history for a bit and reading science fiction

 because history is great at telling you about the perennial problems of power

 putin is always interesting on history

 he's become something of a historian recently with his essays and lectures

 but what history is bad at telling you is well what will the effects of this

 discontinuity

 of technology be

 and so i thought i need some science fiction

 to think more about

 this

 because i'm

 i'm

 i'm

 tending

 to miss

 the importance of technological discontinuity

 if you read a lot of science fiction you read a lot of plague books because

 science fiction writers are really quite fond of the plague scenario

 so the world ends in many ways in science fiction but one of the most popular

 is the lethal pandemic

 so when

 when the first

 email

 came to me i think it was on january the third from my medical

 friend justin stebing

 funny pneumonia and wuhan

 my antennae

 began

 to tingle because it was just like

 one of those science fiction books that begins in just that way

 in a pandemic

 as larry brilliant the epidemiologist said many years ago the key

 is early detection and early action that's how you deal with a novel pathogen

 and almost no western country did that

 we know it was doable because the time and ease and the south koreans

 did it

 and they did it very well

 but really no western country got this right

 some were unlucky because super spreader events happened earlier

 than in other countries italy was hit very hard very early

 for other countries the real disaster came quite late russia which has only relatively

 recently had a really bad experience

 the lesson for me is quite different from the one that most journalists

 thought they were learning last year most journalists last year thought

 trump is a terrible president

 he's saying a lot of crazy things

 it's his fault that we have high excess mortality in the united states

 the same argument was being made by journalists in britain boris johnson dot dot dot brazil

 bolsonaro dot dot dot even india narendra modi

 the same argument

 and i think this argument

 is wrong in a few ways it's true that the populist leaders said many crazy things

 and broadly speaking gave poor guidance to their their populations

 but i don't think it's true to say

 that with different leaders these countries would have done significantly

 better if joe biden had magically been president

 a year earlier

 i don't think the us

 would have done much

 better

 because

 the things

 that caused

 excess mortality

 last year weren't presidential

 decisions

 they were

 utter failure of cdc to provide testing that definitely wasn't trump's fault

 scott gottlieb's book makes that very clear it's just been published recently

 we utterly failed to use technology for contact tracing which the koreans did very well

 we didn't really quarantine anybody seriously

 there was no enforcement of quarantine

 and we exposed the elderly

 to the virus

 as quickly as possible

 in elderly

 care homes

 and

 these things have very little to do with presidential incompetence

 so i think leadership

 is of somewhat

 marginal

 importance

 in a crisis like this because what you really need is your public health bureaucracy

 to get it right and very few western public health bureaucracies

 got it right

 could the president have given better leadership yes

 his correct strategy however was

 to learn from barack obama's playbook with the opioid epidemic

 the opioid epidemic killed as many people on obama's watch as covert did on trump's watch

 and it was worse in the sense because it only happened in the u.s

 and each year it killed more people than the year before over eight years

 nobody to my knowledge has ever seriously blamed obama for the opioid epidemic

 trump's mistake was to put himself front and center of the response

 to claim that he had some unique insight

 into the pandemic and to say

 with every passing week more and more foolish things until even

 a significant

 portion of people who'd voted for him in 2016

 realized that he'd blown it which is why he lost the election

 the correct strategy was actually to make mike pence

 the pandemic tsar and get the hell out the way

 that's what my advice to trump would have been in fact it was in february

 of last year

 so the mistake was

 to to try to lead

 but actually

 leadership in a pandemic's

 almost a contradiction in terms what you really need is your public health bureaucracy

 not to fuck it up

 and they really

 really fucked it up and that was then all blamed on trump

 yes

 you know jim fallows writes a piece in the atlantic that says

 well being the president's like flying a light aircraft

 it's pilot error

 and i

 i read that piece and i thought does he really

 after

 all the years he's spent

 writing

 think that being president is like flying a light aircraft

 i mean

 it's really nothing like flying a light aircraft

 being president is you sit on top of a vast bureaucracy

 with how many different agencies 60 70 we've all lost count

 and you're surrounded by advisers

 at least a quarter of whom are saying this is a disaster

 we have to close the borders and the others are saying

 no no we have to keep the economy going that's what you're running on in november

 so being a president in a pandemic is a very unenviable position

 because you actually can't

 you can't really determine whether your public health bureaucracy

 will get it right or not

 you don't think to push back on that

 just like being churchill in a war is difficult

 so leaving trump abiding aside what i would love to see from a president is somebody

 who makes great speeches and arouses the public to push the bureaucracy the public health bureaucracy

 to get their shit together

 to fire

 certain kinds of people to do i mean i'm

 sorry

 but i'm a big fan of

 powerful speeches

 especially in the modern age with the internet

 it can really move people

 instead

 the lack of speeches

 resulted in certain kinds of forces

 amplifying division

 over whether wear masks or not or all

 it's like it's almost like the public pick some random topic over which to divide themselves

 and there was like a complete indecision which is really what it was fear

 of the of uncertainty materializing itself in some kind of division

 and then you almost like busy yourself with the red versus blue politics

 as opposed to some i don't know fdr type character

 just stands and say

 fuck all this bullshit that we're hearing we're going to manufacture

 5 billion tests

 this is what america is great at we're going to build the greatest testing infrastructure

 ever built or

 something

 or even with the vaccine development

 but that was what i was about to interject yes

 in a pandemic the most important thing is the vaccine

 if you get that right then you should be forgiven for much else

 and that was the one thing the trump administration

 got right because

 they went around the bureaucracy with operation warp speed and achieved a really major success

 so i think the paradox of of the the 2020

 story in the united states is that the one thing that mattered most the trump administration

 got right

 and it got so much else wrong that was sort of marginal

 that we were left with the impression

 that trump had been to blame for the whole disaster which wasn't really quite right

 sure it would have been great if we did operation warp speed for testing

 but ultimately vaccines are more important than tests and

 this brings me to the question that that you raised there of polarization

 and why that happened

 now

 in a book called the square in the tower i argued

 that it would be very costly

 for the united states

 to allow

 the public sphere to continue

 to be dominated

 by a handful of big tech companies

 that this ultimately

 would have

 more adverse effects than simply

 contested elections and i think we saw

 over the past 18 months just how bad this could be because

 the odd thing about this

 country is that we came up with vaccines with 90 plus percent efficacy

 and about 20 of people refuse to get them and still do refuse

 for reasons that seem best explained

 in terms of the anti-vaxx

 network which has been embedded on the internet for a long time predating the pandemic

 reni diresta wrote about this pre-2020

 and this this anti-vax

 network has turned out to kill maybe 200 000 americans who could have been vaccinated

 but were persuaded

 through magical thinking that the vaccine was riskier

 than the virus whereas

 you don't need to be in epidemiology

 you don't need to be a medical scientist to know that the virus

 is about two orders of magnitude

 riskier

 than the vaccine

 so again leadership

 could definitely have been better but the politicization of everything

 was not trump's doing alone it

 happened because

 our public sphere has been dominated by a handful of platforms whose business model

 inherently promotes polarization

 inherently promotes

 fake news and extreme views because those are the things that get

 the eyeballs

 on the screens and sell the ads

 i mean this is now a common place

 but when one thinks about the cost of allowing this

 kind of thing to happen it's now a very high human cost

 and we were foolish to leave uncorrected

 these structural problems in the public sphere that were already very clearly visible in 2016.

 and he described that

 like you mentioned that there's these networks they're almost like laying dormant

# Chapter 10

 is about two orders of magnitude

 riskier

 than the vaccine

 so again leadership

 could definitely have been better but the politicization of everything

 was not trump's doing alone it

 happened because

 our public sphere has been dominated by a handful of platforms whose business model

 inherently promotes polarization

 inherently promotes

 fake news and extreme views because those are the things that get

 the eyeballs

 on the screens and sell the ads

 i mean this is now a common place

 but when one thinks about the cost of allowing this

 kind of thing to happen it's now a very high human cost

 and we were foolish to leave uncorrected

 these structural problems in the public sphere that were already very clearly visible in 2016.

 and he described that

 like you mentioned that there's these networks they're almost like laying dormant

 waiting

 for their time in the sun and they stepped forward in this case

 and that those network effects

 just

 the service catalyst for whatever

 the bad parts of human nature

 i do hope that there's kinds of networks that emphasize

 the the better angels of our nature to to to quote steven pinker

 it's just

 clearly

 and we know this from all the revelations

 of the facebook whistleblower

 there is clearly a very clear tension

 between the business model of a company like facebook

 and the public good

 and they know that i just talked to the founder of instagram i i yes that's

 the case but it's not from a technology perspective

 like absolutely

 true of any kind of social network i think it's possible to build

 actually i think it's

 not just possible i think it's pretty

 easy if you set that as the goal to build social networks

 that don't have these negative effects

 right but if the business model is we sell ads

 and the way you sell ads is to maximize user engagement

 then the algorithm

 is biased in favor

 of fake news and extreme

 views but it's not it's so it's not the ads a lot of people

 blame

 the ads

 the

 the problem i think is the engagement

 and the engagement is just the easiest the dumbest way to solve the ads

 i think there's much different

 metrics that could be used to make a lot more money than the engagement

 in the long term it has more to do with planning for the long term so

 optimizing the selling of ads

 to make people happy

 with themselves in the long term

 as opposed to some kind of addicted

 like dopamine feeling

 and so that's

 to me that has to do with metrics and measuring things correctly and sort of

 also creating a culture with what's valued

 to have difficult conversation

 about what we're doing with society

 all those kinds of things and i i think once you have those conversations

 this takes us back to the university of austin kind of

 once you have those difficult human conversations

 you can design the technology that will actually make

 for

 help people grow

 become the best version of themselves help them be happy in the long term

 what gives you hope about the future

 as somebody who studied some of the darker moments of human history what gives you hope

 a couple of things

 first of all the united states has a very unique operating system

 which was very well designed

 by the founders who thought a lot about history and and

 realized it would take quite a

 a novel design

 to prevent the republic

 going the way of all republics

 because republics

 tend to end up as tyrannies for reasons that were well established

 by the time of the renaissance

 and it gives me hope that this design has worked very well

 and with student enormous stress test stress test in the last

 in the last year i became an american in 2018

 i think

 one of the most important

 features of this operating system is that it is the magnet for talent

 here we sit

 part of the immigration story

 in you know in a darkened room with funny accents talking to russians

 walk into a recording studio and talk about america it's it's very much like a joke

 and elon's a south african and so on and thiel is a german and we're

 we're extraordinarily fortunate that the natives let us come and play

 and and play in a way that we could not in our countries of birth

 and as long as the united states continues

 to exploit that superpower that it is the talent magnet

 then it should out innovate the totalitarian competition

 every time so that's

 that's one reason for being an optimist

 another reason and it's quite a historical reason as you would expect from me

 another reason that i'm

 optimistic

 is

 that my kids

 give me a great deal of hope they range in age from 27 down to four

 but each of them in their different way

 seems to be finding a way through this crazy time of ours without losing contact with

 that culture and civilization

 that i hold dear i don't want to live in the metaverse as mark zuckerberg

 imagines it to me that's a kind of ghastly hell

 i think western civilization is the best civilization

 and i think that almost all the truths about the human condition can be found

 in western literature

 art and music

 and i think also that the the civilization that produced the scientific revolution

 has produced the great problem-solving

 tool that eluded the other civilizations that never really cracked science

 and what gives me hope is that despite

 all the temptations

 and distractions

 that their generation

 [music]

 had to contend with my children in their different ways have found the found their way

 to literature and to art and to music

 and and they are civilized

 and i i don't i don't claim

 much of the credit for that i've done my best but i think it's

 deeply encouraging that

 that that they found their way to the things that i think

 are indispensable for a happy life a fulfilled life nobody i think can be truly fulfilled

 if they're cut off from the great body of western literature for example i've thought

 a lot about

 elon's argument that we might be in a simulation

 no no there is a simulation it's cold literature

 and we just have to decide whether or not to enter it

 i'm currently in the midst of the later stages of of proust's great

 allah and

 observation of human relationships is perhaps more meticulous than that of any other writer

 and it's impossible not to find yourself

 identifying with marcel and his obsessive jealous relationships particularly with alberti

 it's the simulation and you you decide i think

 as a sentient being how far to in your own life

 reenact these more profound

 experiences that others have written down one of my earliest literary simulations

 was to reenact jack kerouac tripping on the road when i was 17

 culminating and getting very wasted in the hanging gardens of zochimilco

 not to be not to be missed and

 it hit me just just as i was reading proof

 that's really

 how to live a rich life

 that one lives life but one lives it

 juxtaposing one's own experience

 against the more refined experiences of the great the great writers

 so it gives me hope that my children do that a bit

 do you include the the russian authors very much in the canon

 yes i don't read russian

 um

 but i was entirely obsessed with russian literature as a schoolboy

 i read my way through dostoyevsky

 tolstoy turganyev i check off i think

 um

 of all of those writers

 tolstoy

 had the biggest impact

 because at the end of war and peace there's this great essay on historical

 determinism

 which i think was the reason i became a historian

 but i'm i'm really temperamentally a kind of togenyev person

 oddly enough

 i i think if you if you haven't read those novelists

 i mean you can't really

 be a complete human being if you haven't

 if you haven't read the brothers karamazov you will not really

 you're not grown up

 and so i think i think in many ways those are the greatest

 the greatest novels raskolnikov's remember raskolnikov's nightmare at the end of crime and punishment

 in which he imagines

 in his dream a world

 in which a terrible virus spreads

 do you remember this and this virus has the effect of making every individual think

 that what he believes is right

 and in this

 self-righteousness

 people fall on one another and commit appalling violence

 that's raskolnikov's nightmare and it's a prophecy it's a terrible prophecy of of russia's future

 yeah it's

 and coupled with that is probably the i also like the french the existentialist

 all that that the full

 spectrum

 and germans hermann has said and just that

 range of human thought has expressed the literature it's fascinating i really

 love your idea that

 the simulation

 like

 one way to to live life is to kind of

 explore these other worlds and borrow from them yes

 wisdom

 that you then just

 map onto your own lives you almost like

 stitched together your life with these kind of pieces from literature

 the highly educated

 person is constantly

 struck

 by illusion

 everything is an allusion to something that one has read and that

 is the simulation that's what

 the real metaverse is it's the imaginary world that we enter when we read

 empathize and then recognize in our daily lives

 some scrap of the shared experience that literature gives us

 yeah i think i've aspired to be the idiot from prince mishkin from dostoevsky

 and in aspiring to be that i have become

 the idiot i feel at least in part

 um

 what you mentioned the human condition

 does love have to do what role does it play in the human condition friendship love

 love is the drug

 kind is this was a great roxy music line

 that brian ferry wrote and love is

 the most powerful and and dangerous of all the drugs

 the um

 the driving force that overrides our reason

 and of course it is the it is the primal it's the primal urge so

 what a civilized society has to do is to prevent that drug that primal force from

 creating mayhem so there have to be rules

 like monogamy

 and

 rituals like like marriage that that reign love in and make the the addicts

 at least

 more or less

 under control and i i think that's that's part of why i'm i'm a romantic

 rather than a you know steve pinker

 enlightenment rationalist because the romantics realized that that love was the drug it's like

 the difference in sensibility

 between

 handel and wagner

 and i i had a vagnerian phase when i was an undergraduate i still remember thinking

 that in in

 as old as libra's toad

 that wagner had got the closest to sex that anybody had ever got

 in in music or perhaps to love

 i'm i'm lucky that i love my wife and that

 that we were by the time we met you know smart enough to understand

 that that love is a drug that you have to kind of take

 in in in certain careful ways

 and that it works best in the context of a of a stable family

 that's that's the key thing that one has to sort of

 take the drug and then submit to the

 the the conventions of of of marriage and family life i

 i think in that respect

 i'm a kind of tamed romantic

 contain romantic

 that's how i would like to think about it and that's the degree

 to which

 your romanticism

 is tamed

 can be then channeled into productive

 work that's why you're a historian

 and a writer

 is the breast is that love is channeled

 through the writing

 so if you're going to be addicted

 to anything

 be addicted

 to work

 i mean we're all addictive but yeah the thing about workaholism

 is that it is the most productive addiction

 and

 and rather that than

 drugs or booze so i i'm i'm yes i'm always trying to channel my anxieties

 in into work

 i learnt that at a relatively early age it's a sort of massively

 productive way of coping with the inner demons

 and again we should teach kids that because

 let's come back to our earlier conversation about universities

 part of what happens at university

 is that adolescents

 have to overcome all the inner demons and these include deep insecurity

 about one's appearance about one's intellect

 and then

 madly raging hormones

 that cause you to behave like a complete fool with

 the people to whom you're sexually attracted all of this is going on in the university

 how can it be a safe space it's a completely dangerous space by definition

 yeah so so yeah teaching young people how to manage these storms

 you know

 that's part of the job and and we've

 we're really not allowed to do that anymore

# Chapter 11

 and rather that than

 drugs or booze so i i'm i'm yes i'm always trying to channel my anxieties

 in into work

 i learnt that at a relatively early age it's a sort of massively

 productive way of coping with the inner demons

 and again we should teach kids that because

 let's come back to our earlier conversation about universities

 part of what happens at university

 is that adolescents

 have to overcome all the inner demons and these include deep insecurity

 about one's appearance about one's intellect

 and then

 madly raging hormones

 that cause you to behave like a complete fool with

 the people to whom you're sexually attracted all of this is going on in the university

 how can it be a safe space it's a completely dangerous space by definition

 yeah so so yeah teaching young people how to manage these storms

 you know

 that's part of the job and and we've

 we're really not allowed to do that anymore

 because we can't talk about these things for fear of the title

 nine

 officers

 kicking

 down the door

 and dragging

 us off in chains

 and like you said hard work and something you call work ethic

 in civilization

 is

 um is a pretty is a pretty effective way to

 achieve i think a kind of happiness in a world that's full of anxiety

 or at least exhaustion so sleep well

 well there is there's a beauty to the exhaustion too that's why running this manual work

 that some some part of us is built for that right i mean we are

 products of of evolution and

 our adaptation to a technological world is a very imperfect one so

 hence the kind of masochistic urge to to run

 i i'd like

 outdoor exercise i don't really like gyms

 so i'll go for long punishing

 runs in in woodland

 hike up hills i like swimming in lakes and in the sea

 because there just has to be that physical

 activity in order to do the good mental work and so

 it's all about trying to do the best work

 that's my sense that we we have

 some random allocation of talent you kind of figure out what it is that you're relatively

 good at and you

 try to do that well i think my father

 encouraged me to think that way

 and

 you don't mind about being average at the other stuff

 the

 kind of sick

 thing is to try to be brilliant

 to everything

 i hate those people

 you should really not worry too much if you're just

 an average double bass player which i am or kind of average skier which i definitely

 am

 doing those things okay is is part of leading a rich and fulfilling life

 i was not a good actor but i got a lot out of

 acting as an undergraduate

 turned out after three years of experimentation

 oxford that i was

 broadly speaking better at writing

 history essays than

 my peers

 and that was my edge that was my comparative

 advantage

 and so i've just tried to make a living

 from

 from that slight edge

 yeah

 that's a beautiful way to describe a life

 is there a meaning to this thing

 is there a meaning to life what is the meaning of life

 i was brought up by a physicist

 and a physician

 they were more or less committed atheists who had left the church of scotland

 as a protest against sectarianism in glasgow

 and so my sister and i were told from an early age life was a cosmic

 accident

 and that was it there was no great meaning to it

 and i i can't really get past that

 isn't there beauty

 to being an accident at a cosmic scale

 yes i wasn't taught to to feel negative about that and if anything

 it was a frivolous

 a frivolous insight the whole thing was a kind of joke

 um and and i think that

 atheism isn't really a basis for ordering a society but it's it's

 been all right for me

 i don't have a kind of sense of of a missing religious

 faith

 for me however there's clearly some embedded

 christian ethics in the way my parents lived and so we were kind of atheist calvinists

 who had kind of deposed

 god but carried on behaving as if we were members of the elect

 in in a moral universe

 so

 that's kind of

 um the state of mind that i was left in and i i think that

 we aren't really around long enough to claim that our individual lives have meaning

 but what

 edmund burke said is true the real social contract is between the generations

 between the dead the living and the unborn

 and the meaning of life is

 for me at least

 to live in a way that honors the dead

 seeks to learn from their accumulated wisdom because they do still outnumber us they outnumber the

 the living by quite a significant margin and then

 to be mindful of the unborn and our

 our

 responsibility

 to them writing books is a way of communicating with the unborn

 it may or may not succeed

 and probably won't succeed if my books are never assigned by work professors

 in the future

 so what we have to do is more than just write books and record podcasts

 there have to be institutions

 i'm 57 now i realized recently

 that succession planning had to be the main focus of the next 20 years because

 there are things that i really care about

 that i want future generations to have access to

 and so the meaning of life i do regard as being intergenerational transfer of wisdom

 ultimately the species will go extinct at some point

 even if we do colonize mars one senses that

 physics will catch up with this particular organism but it's in the pretty far distant future

 and so

 the meaning of life is to make sure that

 for as long as there are

 human beings

 they are able to live the kind of fulfilled lives

 ethically fulfilled intellectually fulfilled

 emotionally fulfilled lives that civilization has made possible

 it would be easy for us to revert

 to the uncivilized world there's a fantastic book

 that i'm going to misremember milos is the captive soul the captive mind rather

 which has a fantastic passage here he was a polish

 intellectual who says americans can never imagine what it's like

 for civilization to be completely destroyed

 as it was in poland

 at the end of by the end of world war ii

 to have

 no

 rule of law

 to have no security

 of

 even person never mind property rights

 they can't imagine what that's like and what it will lead you to do

 so one reason for teaching history is to remind the lucky

 generation z members of california that

 that civilization is a thin film and it can be destroyed remarkably easily

 and to preserve civilization is a tremendous

 responsibility that we have it's a huge responsibility

 and we must we must not destroy ourselves

 whether it's in the name of of wokism

 or the pursuit of the metaverse

 preserving civilization

 and making it available not just to our kids but to people we'll never know

 generations ahead that's the meaning

 and

 do so by studying the lessons of history

 right not only studying them but then acting on them

 for me the biggest problem is how do we apply history more effectively

 it seems as if our institutions including government are very very bad at applying history

 lessons of history are learnt poorly if at all

 analogies

 are drawn crudely

 often the wrong inferences are drawn

 one of the big intellectual challenges for me is how to make history more

 useful

 and this was the kind of thing that

 professors used to hate but really practically useful so that

 policymakers

 and citizens

 can think about the decisions that they face with a more historically informed

 body of knowledge

 whether it's a pandemic the challenge of climate change what to do about taiwan

 i can't think of a better set of

 of things to know

 before you make decisions about those things than

 the the

 things that history has to offer well i love the discipline of applied

 history

 basically

 going to history

 and saying

 what

 are the

 key principles

 here that are applicable

 to the problems of today

 right and how can we solve that great philosopher of history r.g collingwood

 said in his autobiography which was published in 1939

 that the purpose of history was to reconstitute

 past thought from whatever surviving remnants there were and then to juxtapose it

 with our own predicament and that's that juxtaposition

 of past experience with present experience that is so important

 we don't do that well

 and indeed we've we've flipped

 it so that academic historians

 now think their mission is to travel back

 to the past with the value system of 2021

 and castigate

 the the dead for their racism and sexism and transphobia

 and whatnot

 and that's exactly wrong

 our mission is to go back and try to understand

 what it was like to live in the 18th century

 not to go back and condescend to the

 the people of the past

 and once we've had a

 better understanding once we've seen into their lives read their words tried to reconstitute

 their experience to come back

 and understand our own time better

 that's what we should really be doing but academic history has gone completely haywire

 and it does almost the exact opposite of what i think it should do

 and by studying history

 walk beautifully

 gracefully through the simulation

 as you described by mapping the lessons of history into the world of today

 we have virtual reality already in our heads we do not need oculus

 in the metaverse

 this was an incredible hopeful conversation

 in in many ways that did not expect i thought our conversation

 would be much more about history than about the future

 and it turned out to be the opposite

 thank you so much for talking today
