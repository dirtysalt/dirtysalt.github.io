# Chapter 1

i'm i'm sick of multi-millionaires

 telling

 kids who can't afford to turn the heating on you just need to be more entrepreneurial

 it's sick

 dan it's sick

 well your video

 where you talk about

 if you don't have a rich dad you're screwed

 well to me if i had have come across your content

 at 19

 20 years old i would have been screwed

 my friends

 can't feed their kids

 okay if it was that easy

 why is everybody

 not doing it i'll tell you why people aren't doing it

 it's

 because

 you like to say one thing back on

 that

 today's debate

 is fiery to say the least but important nonetheless

 as i sat down with two leading experts in wealth and entrepreneurship

 and the economy

 to discuss the state of the us the state of the uk and the western world

 do you think the reason

 the average brit american are getting poorer

 is because they don't know how to create wealth no the reason people are getting poorer

 is because of big governments

 record levels of taxes

 an outdated schooling system

 technology

 and remote working

 you sure about that

 how do you disagree with those opinions

 living standards are falling

 because of growing wealth in equality

 if you allow the rich to get richer

 they squeeze

 the middle class and the poor class out of things like housing

 let's cut tax on people who are working

 hard

 and let's raise tax on the richest

 and most powerful

 people in the world that's an overly

 simplified

 view of things we now have a th000

 millionaires

 a month leaving

 which means every ordinary

 person

 who pays

 10 grand

 a year in tax

 will now have to pay

 20

 grand

 a year in tax

 you end up cutting off your nose to spite your face

 if we are a country

 that don't try and do things which are necessary

 because they are hard

 then our kids

 will live in poverty

 what do you want people to do there's a lot of different ways

 backle

 up

 and we'll continue to do what we do thank you so much

 gary

 daniel

 daniel you've been on the show a few times before so i want to start with

 gary and understand a little bit about your backstory and who you are and

 having

 been through the trading

 game and read

 and watched many many of your videos over time i have a

 a sort of deep

 understanding of that but for anyone that doesn't know you

 can you give me a picture of the context

 that

 um has brought you to where you are today

 writing

 about the things you're writing about today and running the youtube channel

 and speaking to the subject matter that you're speaking about today

 take me right back and give me as much as you possibly

 can

 okay so

 my name is gary stevenson

 i was born in a place called ilford which is in outer east london

 quite a poor family little terrace house by the railway

 you know playing football in the streets kind of stuff

 um

 always very good at maths since i was a kid very talented master student

 eventually able to get into the london school of economics

 which is an extremely elite university economics university

 in the center of london which is

 basically a kind of investment banking boot camp got a job as a trader

 started working full-time as a short-term interest rates trader at city bank in london

 in june

 2008

 when i was 21 obviously

 yeah exactly that's just before the big credit crash the big leman crisis

 and i watched the leman crisis happen in front of my eyes i was um

 short-term interest rate trading is basically like short-term loans

 and during the credit crisis what credit crisis is is nobody can borrow any money

 so like short-term loans become really really important important

 my desk which was like historically an unfashionable

 area of trading

 became like the center of the crisis or one of the centers of the crisis

 people started making tons of money

 um i was working with all these crazy

 people

 and you can imagine

 me like i turn up

 21 years old and then like within three months

 like everyone around me is making a ton of money during the credit crisis

 but what really interested

 me

 was what happened after the crisis itself

 which was

 so we're betting on interest rates

 long story short interest rates

 come down when the economy is weak

 and they go up when the economy is strong

 or when the economy is overheating

 from an inflation

 perspective

 in 2018

 all the interest rates go to zero

 so suddenly

 our job is basically predicting and betting on

 when will

 those interest rates go back up which is when will the economy recover

 and this is super interesting right in

 2008

 because all the interest rates went to zero so quickly

 like before

 2008

 it's important to remember

 rates would move

 from like five and a half to five and a quarter

 and then here in 2008

 everywhere in the world slashing to zero bo half a percent exactly and everybody

 all the economists were like wow this is going to cause a massive recovery

 because they thought

 that interest rates were powerful

 and everybody predicted

 that rates would come back up in 2009

 which of course we knowed they didn't

 then everybody predicted that rates would go up in 2010

 which we now know they didn't and then at the beginning of 2011

 everybody was predicting rates would definitely go up this year and this to me

 was so interesting

 so interesting because you know i studied master and economics at one of the

 best economics universities

 in the world and now i'm working with these

 traders

 who are getting paid millions of pounds a year million pounds a year to predict

 the economy to predict the interest rates

 and everybody

 is wrong

 year after year after year and this

 was

 i was

 so amazing

 to me for a couple of reasons

 first of all it's like wow

 like

 this is a big

 thing that we as a society should understand and like we're getting it wrong

 but secondly

 if all of the best guys in the world are getting this wrong

 then if i can figure this out

 i can make a ton of money here

 g how much money did you make for city bank at the age of 24 years

 old

 that year so that year 2011

 i put this big bet on that it would get worse forever

 and i was city bank's

 most profitable trader in the world that year

 and i made them just over $ 35

 million

 you made them $35 million you eventually decide to leave city bank yeah why

 i mean i think that's an interesting question right you know

 in the sense that i've just explained to you what happened which is

 i made a ton of money by betting on the collapse of

 western

 society

 i did it in 2011 i did it again in 2012

 um

 i would prefer

 for it not to collapse step

 and i'm trying to stop it from

 collapsing

 when you say it collapsing what exactly you're referring to that you you don't want to

 collapse

 so you you born in botswana right yeah do you still have family there

 um i've got family in nigeria

 which is where my my family are from i was born in botswana

 because we were visiting there but

 got family in africa do you go to nigeria much no

 i i've got home in cape town in south africa so i see the

 it's a great place if you want to see

 inequality

 i think there

 is

 a naivity

 in in in this country in places like the us that the kind of inequality

 the kind of broad poverty

 that you see in places like south africa in places like nigeria

 in places like india

 can't happen

 here

 it will happen here

 that is the future

 of this country

 that is the future of the us and i'm not just saying

 that

 i'm betting on it and i've been betting on it for 15

 years

 and i've been right for 15

 years

 that is what i'm trying to avoid

 daniel where did you come from yeah so i grew up in australia

 um and i was born to low-income

 family i grew up in a place that had 24%

 unemployment

 pretty much the only jobs or opportunities around me were things like

 the trades building construction

 pest control

 um hospitality and tourism

 um so

 at 14 i got a job at mcdonald's

 and then i'm

 got a job in a bar and pizza hut delivery driving and i discover entrepreneurship

 so i discover books about entrepreneurship

 and i discovered that some people make millions similar to yourself

 you saw canary wf i read a book about business ownership

 and as we sit here today can you give me

 the overview of your business success since then

 yeah so i now have a group of companies that i've either started or bought

 um there's i've just sold a company so there's seven companies in the group

 um

 i've started a couple of software

 companies

 one of our companies

 is now the fastest

 growing

 one of the fastest growing companies in the uk

 um we you know we're a software business

 i've got a couple of agencies i've got a education and training business

 and where when you think about the uk and broadly the western world today

 what is your assessment of where we're at as a country and what's concerning you because

 gary expressed quite articulately

 that his big concern is that because of wealth ine equality

 we're going to end up in a similar position to the likes of india

 what are you concerned about i agree that it wasn't that long ago that we had

 real serious wealth inequality in this country there are amazing photos from

 like a 100 years ago of kids working in mines

 and kids

 doing oyster shocking

 and all this horrible

 work and

 um you know

 there's a there's a book charles dickens wrot wrote called the tale of two cities

 and the opening

 line of the book

 is it was the best of times it was the worst of times

 and i think we've actually gotten to that point here where some people in the uk

 it's the best of times

 if you

 like in your situation you're you know you're booming you're a globally successful business

 um i've got a globally successful business and then there are a lot of people who

 completely

 cannot relate to this their you know

 energy

 prices are now the most expensive in the western world

 house prices are completely unaffordable

 it used to be

 used to take 3 years to

 for a deposit it's now 20 years if you you know theoretically

 20 years if you can save for a deposit

 food prices are through the roof

 so we're we're in a really diff like for anyone who

 is not tapped into digital economy fast growth and all of that sort of stuff

 life is getting harder and worse

 um and things are collapsing

 um if you if you would

 um go with that

 the

 there is a predictable

 path countries

 go on

 and there's this thing called the economic freedom index

 and the economic freedom index basically

 says how economically

 free are you how how much access do you have to free markets

# Chapter 2

 um if you if you would

 um go with that

 the

 there is a predictable

 path countries

 go on

 and there's this thing called the economic freedom index

 and the economic freedom index basically

 says how economically

 free are you how how much access do you have to free markets

 um do can you start a business can you scale a business

 um does anything inhibit your ability to run your own life

 countries that have high degrees of economic freedom have very low poverty they have widespread affluence

 and countries that have low economic freedoms

 have high poverty and it can be the difference between less than 10%

 right up to 70%

 poverty rates

 um and when countries go on a path towards economic freedom

 poverty

 just drops

 so india for examp example has been on that path and they announced

 today that they've almost

 eradicated

 abject poverty or extreme poverty

 um the uk went on that path of

 low economic freedom to high economic freedom and we saw

 poverty rates come right down

 but in 2008 when the global financial crisis happened

 one of the things that happened is the government said we need to step in

 and we need to take charge and everyone said please do

 um so

 they

 came in and they said all right we're going to ramp

 up debt

 ramp

 up taxes

 to pay for the debt and we're also going to put it all regul

 in and unfortunately

 that starts to reduce economic freedom

 then the pandemic happens

 and they say oh we're going to spend

 more money again through debt we're going to have more

 taxes more regulations

 less economic freedom so the uk

 we went from an 82

 when i arrived in 2006

 went from 82 out of 100

 down to 68 out of 100 so we're less economically

 free

 and predictably

 what we will always see happen if you lower people's economic freedom

 more poverty

 less affluence the millionaires and the wealth creators leave the people who are stuck in

 um dead end jobs

 or no jobs get incredibly frustrated

 everyone starts looking for someone to blame people are angry

 and they're like who do we blame

 and who do they blame

 it's very different because in the us we blame us blam someone different to the uk

 so

 we have a historical

 cultural memory

 in the uk we have a cultural memory

 that the people to blame are the rich

 so so

 we have landlords

 and aristocracy

 and the landed gentry

 those guys are to blame

 right so blame the rich is what we say in the uk

 in the us

 they have a very different view their cultural memory is that they're anti-government

 they want limited government

 in 2023

 there was this song that came out called rich men north of richmond

 and it was the number one song in america

 and the lyrics of the song basically says

 people in washington do not care about working people

 um they att taxing everything we touch you can't earn money they depreciate the dollar

 um they tax tax tax tax tax

 and they want to control

 our lives those are the lyrics of the songs

 controlling

 our lives and taxing us

 so the american

 reaction to this is who's to blame government

 so we want smaller government we want a department of government efficiency

 to come in we want

 someone as a wrecking ball who will come in and smash government

 the british instinct

 is

 hate the rich

 it must be the rich's fault so when we look for

 like all all of the western countries that implemented lower economic

 freedoms

 created more poverty less affluence and more disruption to their economies

 so both us and uk for example and australia as well but both

 sides of the pond

 want someone to blame it's just that the americans blame government and we blame the rich

 gary i'm sure you you have a lot to

 to say there i know you both use the word collapsing

 so you agree

 that there's a problem

 here

 but i think

 you from studying

 both of your sort of

 perspectives

 you think that

 this the solution and the cause of the problem is different

 i mean i put bets on i put bets on

 i put bet that's what i do i put bets on

 um

 at the beginning of covid

 we knew the government was going to give enormous amount of money out

 um

 total amount of money now uk government deficit since the beginning of co is is1 trillion

 pounds

 us number is $4

 trillion that's you know £20,000 per uk adult

 my background is i understand that when

 the distribution gets worse when inequality gets worse living standards full

 so when

 when the uk government

 was going to give a trillion

 pounds out

 all i wanted to know was

 who's going to end up with that money

 that's all i wanted to know

 and um i mean the us number 13 trillion 14

 trillion

 is just outlandish but i think the most amazing thing i've ever seen in my whole

 life

 was that at the beginning of co the very beginning of co we knew

 governments across the world we're going to be giving out tens of trillions of pounds dollars

 euros

 nobody even thought to ask

 who's going to get tens of trillions richer nobody in the conservatives

 nobody in labor nobody in the republicans

 nobody in democrats nobody in the media nobody in academia

 nobody the central banks nobody asked this it's

 it's

 it's it's almost beautiful it's it's unbelievable

 it's unbeliev

 so i i sat down and i did i did the analysis at the

 beginning

 because lockdown is essentially banning the spending of the rich

 and replacing that spending of the rich with printed money from government

 what happens is the government

 gives workers money

 they use that money to pay their bills to pay their rent pay their mortgage

 it goes to the rich the rich can't spend it because they're locked indoors

 and what you get is essentially

 an enormous amount of money from the government

 to the poor to the rich

 and this

 massive

 massive transfer

 of wealth

 um

 that was obviously going that was so obviously going to happen at the beginning of co

 nobody discussed it which i think is itself

 amazing

 let me ask you a question right if we were now

 to pause the economy for 2 years

 and during that pause

 massively increase wealth inequality

 what do you think would happen to broad living conditions when we

 unpaused

 see one of the things that i think happened during the pandemic

 is everything went digital

 and

 um entrepreneurs and investors did actually think about what would happen the investors immediately

 boomed stocks like zoom and microsoft

 and we ended up with the magnificent 7

 um i don't know if you you know there's seven big tech companies in the usa

 market

 and those big seven companies have gone from five trillion valuation to 17 tr trillion valuation

 in the time of the pandemic and if you think about what did the pandemic do

 everyone had to work from home so we all had to have microsoft subscriptions

 everyone went onto website so we all went to aws

 amazon we all started buying

 and learning how to buy from amazon rather than buying from from our local high streets

 every business in the world figured out how to run their business remotely

 we had this massive transformation

 it wasn't it was like it's actually a wholesale transformation of society

 that we all learned how to live and work differently

 um i saw a boom in entrepreneurship so what i saw as an entrepreneur accelerator

 um someone who runs an entrepreneur accelerator

 is just there was this sudden boom in people launching businesses

 setting up shopify accounts setting up youtube

 businesses

 so the money really has moved from the traditional economy the 2019

 high street economy

 over to the digital economy

 and what we see

 is that the investors know what's going on and they just invest in this magnificent

 seven company i think

 50%

 of the gains of the s&p 500

 is tech companies

 um so all the money just goes flooding into the the technology companies

 my my belief is that technolog is really dividing people

 that essentially if you take anyone from any background

 if they work in technology

 if they're in media tech finance any of that stuff that operates online

 they tend to actually do pretty

 pretty well after the pandemic i ask you a question yeah go for

 do you think the average

 brit american australian

 whoever

 the person out there is watching if they quit their job

 and go work in tech

 do you think they'll be able to get financial security relatively

 easily

 depends when you defi define financial security the issue with house prices

 the ability

 to raise a family have a home yeah so having a home is a big issue

 right so

 here's here's what i here's what i see with houses

 cuz houses annoy me as well my dad bought a house for

 $188,000

 which is about £10,000 or less than £10,000 and it's probably worth over a million dollars

 um today so something went wrong and and this by the way is not uk specific

 the socialist

 countries

 had house prices go through the roof

 if you go to norway or sweden their house prices grew by

 600%

 in then it's happening everywhere

 it's not specific to anywhere it's happening everywhere but but what happened

 what what has definitely

 in the uk

 is we actually have

 um a housing traffic jam

 so

 in this country in the uk

 we have 9.5

 million homes that have two or more spare bedrooms

 big family homes

 have two or more spare bedrooms and when you look into who owns those houses

 78%

 of housing wealth is baby boomers

 um and now anecdotally

 i take my kids trick-or-treating at halloween

 and we go down a street that is big family homes

 and you go knock on the doors and it's all people over 65

 right and

 living in a big family home with empty spare bedrooms

 we you think the average american over 65 is living

 luxuriously

 the average american over 65

 so more than half of the us economy is in the hands of baby boomers

 right so they own all the houses

 the the houses got bought up cheap

 baby boomers

 still own those houses to this day the big family homes with multiple spare bedrooms

 are empty

 um and now that creates this traffic jam

 people my age my grandparents

 yeah they all owned property

 all four of them died with nothing

 um because

 that wealth which they had in in property was

 was used in equity release schemes

 they they it was used in paying through their retirement

 it was used in end of life care

 um do you think when those old people die young people today will be rich

 there is half the economy held by baby burus

 it's either going to be

 passed down or passed into the age care industry or passed into

# Chapter 3

 all four of them died with nothing

 um because

 that wealth which they had in in property was

 was used in equity release schemes

 they they it was used in paying through their retirement

 it was used in end of life care

 um do you think when those old people die young people today will be rich

 there is half the economy held by baby burus

 it's either going to be

 passed down or passed into the age care industry or passed into

 the but the issue of why we can't get homes two things

 government

 massively

 inflated the value of homes through debt so they just in injected

 like low interest rates that you involved in who who is the debt to

 well the debt is to anyone who can take out al loan because if a 0%

 interest rates or 2%

 interest r you think it's the debt is the ordinary

 families

 do you think ordinary families are the creditors

 when you say ordinary families you mean

 bottom third so if your average

 british or american

 family

 now has half a million pounds of debt

 crit it's anyone who could get their at that particular

 time

 anyone who could get their hands on a loan

 to buy a house

 but who has the credit

 who has who is on the other side of the debt

 so if the average british family

 million p banking license does the average british family have half million pound of credit

 well a lot of people have got a lot of equity

 in their home now you think the average

 british

 family

 is sitting on half a million

 pound

 cash

 i'd love to look at the what the actual

 number

 is but it's a couple

 hundred thousand

 worth of equity

 78

 what about the credit on the line credit on the line

 owns the credit on the line in mind it's disproportionately

 older people so

 think the average

 british

 old person is sitting on million

 millions

 of pounds of cash

 not millions

 of cash

 no

 equity

 well someone is on the other side of

 just one say the difference

 the difference is if you inflate

 the value of a house

 you don't have cash you have a

 house that's worth a lot of money

 so 78%

 of home ownership

 wealth is in the hands of people over 65

 now it's baby boomer generation

 and they got a great gift from the government

 which is the government said we're going to just give free loans away

 if someone previously could have only afforded to take out a 200 grand loan

 with low interest rates they can afford a 300 grand l do you think it's okay

 that the average

 british

 or american

 young person

 will never

 own

 any wealth

 the issue is not whether it's okay or not

 the issue is what do you do about it i do you own wealth

 i've got wealth yeah you own wealth

 but depends what you call wealth i do so do we three multimillionaires

 do

 we think it's okay

 that the average

 brit or american

 young person will never own any wealth

 that to me that's because i don't think that's okay to me that's not the debate

 is it okay it's not well it it's not okay no we want widespread

 would you rather that the people who currently are multi-millionaires

 would you rather that all of the world was owned by their kids

 i think that the way you see the world as a trader

 is that the world is a zero sum game

 and that there's

 basically

 the pi is a fixed pi and it gets sliced

 up

 how fast is the growing now there's something like this

 what's uk gdp growth at the moment yeah it's not it's not high right 1%

 how much did your wealth grow in the last year

 exponentially

 okay so if our weals

 my wealth probably grew about 20%

 in the last year maybe 30 okay okay

 if our worlds are growing 30%

 and the economy is growing at 1%

 where is it coming from if it's not coming from our viewers

 so i'll tell you where my wealth comes from

 my wealth comes from building technology companies

 and the way it works is pretty weird

 which is that

 i invent something out of my head

 and i go to investors

 and i say to the investors

 here's what we're going to create and i give them a spreadsheet

 and then they say we'll give you a couple hundred grand to get started

 which is called seed

 capital

 but on paper makes me worth a couple of million

 right but there there's nothing has been taken from anyone at this point

 the investors have said okay we'll invest some money then as the business succeeds

 some more investors

 come along and they say we'll give you a little bit more money to keep growing

 it

 um and i'm innovating something new

 and let's say investors come in and give me a million pounds

 and for 10% of the company

 and the rest of the company's worth 9 million

 or $9 million

 right

 so i'm not stealing

 something from the existing economy i'm bringing something from outside of the economy

 into the economy

 um and my quote unquote net worth is growing exponentially

 because investors

 say

 we'll give you a little bit of money that values the rest of the pie

 at a lot of money

 but there's everyone's getting richer

 in the in the wealth create

 there's where there's wealth extraction

 which is what traders do they extract from the existing economy

 um and they bet on

 the economy and then there's wealth creation which what entrepreneurs

 do they come up with new ideas

 better ways of doing things

 and they build wealth so do you think the reason

 our viewers

 the average brit american are getting poorer is because they

 don't know how to create wealth

 no the reason people are getting poorer is because economic freedoms are being eroded

 when we have high economic that with taxes

 well anything that imp it could be anything that impacts economic freedom so

 taxes and regulations are big was economic freedom higher in the 50s

 50s was okay so 50s was a

 interesting time

 we we were in food russians in this country till

 1956 so we had 10 years of food rations after the war

 um we had a labor shortage

 because only really men worked women hadn't entered the workforce in mass

 um there had been three or 400,000

 men

 killed in war

 so we actually had this big labor shortage the whole country needed to rebuild

 because of the blitz had bombed it so we had this huge need for economic

 activity

 and not enough people to do it we only had 2%

 unemployment

 people who had had their blown off were put to work at that particular time

 so we had this boom this postwar

 boom and we also had the postwar baby boom which drove

 consumption

 and then when we got to the 60s we had the roaring 60s or the

 um the swinging 60s right pretty amazing time in britain and along comes high taxes

 and they put up the taxes massively at the end of the 60s

 um and it pretty much crashed the economy

 one of the things that happened so what were the tax rates in the 50s

 well they went up as high as 80 to 90%

 for the top for the top ear i think it was in the 60s

 you sure about that i think the 50s are unique what is the answer

 feel like you they went up off the wall

 they went up after the war well in the us actually

 tax rates

 started

 got before the war

 but also the size of government as a percentage of gdp was like 30%

 it was a tiny like we're we're now 45%

 of the uk economy is government spending

 we have got a mass who funds that spending

 debt they the bank of england allows them to print endless amounts of debt which deflates

 gary i want to get your opinion

 here

 cuz you're asking a lot of questions

 but i actually don't know your opinion

 i just want to know what daniel thinks

 and i want our viewers to be able to research daniel's

 opinions

 but how how do you disagree with those opinions

 listen

 daniel's a businessman he's obviously a very successful businessman

 you know i i've not been any

 i'm not a businessman i'm not going to pretend to be a businessman i'm an economist

 i make money by being right on the economy

 daniel's a good businessman

 and i'm right on the economy

 you know it's a simple as that basically

 you know i'm not a good businessman

 but i've got 15 years of being right on this on the economy

 and look and i know

 you're probably a wealthy

 man

 you probably don't want

 to pay high taxes

 you probably don't want your kids to pay high taxes

 but we exist in an economy

 where wealth

 is being extracted

 out of the middle class out of the working class very very rapidly

 it's benefiting people like the three of us at this table

 it will benefit our kids

 you know our kids will be rich their kids will be poor

 and i just think we should be honest with them capitalism's finished we won

 well done stephen

 well done daniel well done gary

 it's over now our kids will be rich their kids will be poor

 they'll pay the tax taxes we won't pay the taxes

 we'll avoid it i'll make money betting on it year after year

 why are we lying to them why are we lying to them

 yeah i i think that's an overly simplified

 view of things i don't

 an overly simplified

 view of things that has made me a multimillionaire

 yeah well look entrepreneurs take bets on the economy as well we take bets differently

 um when we start a company we're betting on how the econ the average

 british and american worker at the 50th percentile

 do you think their kids will be richer than they are

 it depends if we have economic freedom

 or not

 right we're going to have a split test on this

 right we're going to have a split test we're going to have

 the uk seems like we're going to have more taxes more regulations

 and it seems like the us is going to have less taxes and less regulations

 here's what i've noticed i've noticed that places like singapore that have small governments

 um have got widespread affluence there's not a lot of poverty in singapore

 yeah except for the cleaners living in the closets yeah you know

 look but we don't count them in the statistics just like we don't count our viewers

 that that's not widespread in well there's a lot of people w

 i've seen them in the closets

 i've seen them in the closets there are there are some but they're not singaporeans

 well also you only count the rich ones

 look the the also the issue is is that they've come from

 even worse conditions in many cases people mve to singapore for an increase in lifestyle

 right the

 um

 you could take ireland or switzerland

 right economically free places ireland was economically in a disaster

 in think the average irish person lives well

 well the their

 economy

 their economy almost collapsed in 2011

 and they went down the road of lower taxes lower regulations and they attracted

 all sorts of businesses

 into the economy

 and do you think that works well for the average irishman

 who doesn't own a home in dublin

 the the if you measure everything by home ownership

 i'm measuring people by the average

 i want to know what the average man or woman

 today lives that by the way i i'm also furious

 about the home ownership

 thing everyone is

 um i think it's utterly ridiculous

 the way like the idea that homes are now worth 10 times the average wage

 all of that difference is i blame government for that

 i blame high taxes

 where they've

 because of high taxes they can take out more debt

 they can then inflate the economy do you think if we shrink the government

 if we start to slash government spending

 do you think that would improve living conditions well the uk government is 45%

 of the economy

 like that's a huge government it's

 think using

 additions will increase

 in the next few years

 because we have us government now that's planning to slash

 the us government

 well that's what the us voters have asked for do you think it would improve

 living

 conditions

 do i think it'll improve

 the average american if they're smaller government

 yeah i trust market so you think

 the average us american

 will be rich in years than the here what i trust

 i trust

 economic

 freedom

 if people have freedom

 they create

 better decisions for their own life there's two ways to make decisions

 right there's two ways you have freedom

 i got less freedom

 than i did when i ared

 just

 because my sister can't pay the rent

 is that freedom

 the

 if you're living in a country

 she can't

 to live in the city that she was

 born

 in

 i i agree

# Chapter 4

 just

 because my sister can't pay the rent

 is that freedom

 the

 if you're living in a country

 she can't

 to live in the city that she was

 born

 in

 i i agree

 you and i agree on the problem you keep bringing

 back to the problem

 i keep bringing it back to people because the people who watch we're millionaires

 okay the people who watch us are mostly not

 millionaires

 is life going to get better for them they life will get better

 if you are connected to the most productive parts of the economy

 um if you pretend that it's 1955

 and you recreate the postwar era conditions if you try to go back to 1955

 i don't think

 that's going to work

 so so let me ask on that then

 the point

 about

 if you're connected

 to the most productive

 parts of the economy

 i was quite

 um

 quite surprised

 when i was doing some research on this to find that there's quite big differences

 between the uk and the us in terms of gdp

 growth

 in q4 2024 the us economy grew by 6% while the uk growth was 0.1%

 so they're doing significantly better in that regard us gdp per head stands at $82,000

 per head whereas the uk stands at $49,000

 per head and stock market performance

 which is an

 indication of i guess what ever

 rose by 300%

 in the us whereas the footsy

 100 declined by 20% which is the uk stock market productivity growth since 2018

 productivity increased by 30%

 in the united states which has outpaced

 the the uk and lastly income growth since 2007

 american income per head has increased by 72%

 while it has decreased

 in by 2%

 in the uk in dollar terms

 so they seem to be doing better from if you just look at the economy

 um

 why is that is that because they lean more into technology and innovation and entrepreneurship

 and is it because of the things you were saying earlier about their attitude towards

 the govern like reduced government spending versus tax the rich why

 i'm keen to hear gary's

 view on this because i

 understand yours because you've just said it

 yeah i think these are great statistics

 um and of course the us has a strong reput

 reputation

 for being very free markets and being very small states

 in the last 5 years 10 years 15 years

 we've had a uk government that has been aggressively slashing the state

 and the us state's bigger than ever it's 45%

 of the economy and the us we had

 a government in the last four years which has been running a massive massive deficit

 so in that period of time

 it appears the government which has been aggressively increasing its deficit has massively overperformed

 the government which has been aggressively slashing the

 state

 that's what it looks to be from the last

 i mean b joe biden in enormously increased the deficit enormously

 and the conservatives were austerity government for 14 years

 which one seems to have given the better numbers

 well i mean there were austerity in name only they went from 30%

 the state was 30% of gdp to 45% of government services haveed

 now they're the government is terrible at doing most things that's the problem

 you you you don't want you don't think that spending on

 government service has been slashed

 let me let me zoom out a little you think the police spending has been slashed

 oh police spending

 is definitely

 do you know where it ends up it ends up with like big corporates

 big consulting

 who get paid $50 million to produce a report to tell government some thing

 right all of these big i won't name names but all the big consulting firms

 they're all blood suckers to government they

 they know that the money is in the government

 and they set up business models to extract that money from government

 and it also is in the financial trading side of things

 the one of the issues that we've got

 right and this is a big big issue as well cuz you care about wealth

 inequality

 one of the biggest issues i see

 is that during the pandemic we all learned to work remotely

 and remotor

 became

 the norm and what i see at the moment is

 huge amounts of what would have been normal british jobs

 are going to the philippines

 going to india going to

 vietnam

 people who work remotely now

 we now have a thousand millionaires a month leaving to go to dubai we have 120,000

 british people living in dubai

 in in that economy the world's become incredibly mobile

 and one of the things that's happening

 is that what would have previously been good british jobs

 are getting moved overseas to lower cost countries

 and that's technology

 that drives that wedge

 the us is very smart in that they've built a technology

 powerhouse

 and the uk has completely lost our technology industry

 our tech industry is in decline same same across europe

 china

 and the us

 know that the game is tech

 and they've basically pulling all the tech company

 into the into their

 borders

 and what's happening a lot is the erosion

 of good jobs and the erosion of of just normal

 well-paying

 jobs because they they're going

 and it's a bit of a self-fulfilling loop that the more we lose millionaires

 the tax burden falls on everyone else so they put the taxes up

 and then the millionaires

 say oh the taxes are too high so they leave

 um i've watched some of the most incredible entrepreneurs

 that you would want here that would employ your sister at a high rate

 um and they've

 picked up and left cuz the taxes are too high so you saying we should tax

 working people less

 well the the the overall government has to be smaller

 you can't whoever what do you want to cut in the government if you

 yeah i mean you'd have to child services we'd have to no police no education

 nhs

 all i know is this pensions

 you go to switzerland they sp single mothers 25%

 disabled benefits

 what do you want to cut hold up all i know is in switzerland

 i tell you what i want

 the government is

 ta

 on those entrepreneurs

 and raise the taxes on the billionaires

 because i worked my tits off how many billionaires are in the uk

 there's a lot of billionaires in the uk 150

 yeah so tax them more what do they pay listen i went my tits off

 and i paid it was 50%

 top rate tax 50%

 top rate tax plus national insurance 60%

 million to bring my family out of poverty

 at the same time the duke of westminster inherited 10 billion

 and paid nothing do you think that's fair that's not true

 okay why is it not true because the duke of westminster

 is one of the highest tax payers in the country what does he pay

 well on the trust the groer estate

 they don't pay inheritance tax because trusts can't die they pay something called periodic taxes

 which how much 6% every 10 years 6% so they pay 0.6%

 so i paid 16% and this guy pays 0.6%

 apples with apples inheritance tax is 40% across the course of your life

 if a trust is

 if a person lives who owns a trust for 70 years

 then 6% time 7 would be 42 so they actually pay more so he pays 0.6%

 a year

 pro 0.6%

 that would be the same as

 what percent did i pay per

 no no no but that's 60%

 so you're saying i pay what 60 of a 0.6

 what 100 times the tax not comparing apples with apples

 wait why is it not apples with apples this guy pays 0.6%

 a year i paid 60% a year that's inheritance tax i paid that 60%

 every year daniel every year i paid you're pay income tax so why have i du

 p more than the duke of westminster pays income tax he probably

 he probably makes your bill blush

 yeah think can pay his income tax

 yeah well if he's going to live he has to withdraw money to have his income

 he also

 let me give you a list of all the taxes

 he would pay

 he'd pay income

 tax

 corporate

 tax he'd pay stamp duty when he buys a building

 he pays

 any of the other taxes vat when he spends money

 all the same taxes

 apply to a duuk

 as they apply to anybody

 else

 so you think he pays income tax on on the income on that

 any income he draws

 okay well our viewers can research whether he pays income tax on his income

 because i don't think he does

 it's in a trust but the only difference with the trust

 versus income

 is that the trust pays periodic tax versus inheritance tax 0.6%

 but we're only talking inherit that that's just one type of tax

 you think he's paying 60%

 on his income

 he's one of the highest taxpayers

 in the uk i'm not like his big fan

 club but

 the truth is he's one of the highest taxpayers

 in the uk

 um he's one of the biggest employers

 in the uk

 he's one of the

 like

 one of the biggest land owners

 in the uk land owners

 in the uk

 right

 so

 the the issue is is does he pay tax

 all the same taxes that apply to you apply to him

 and if you want to set up a trust you can also pay periodic

 taxes as well

 um which would be on top of all the other taxes so what would you say

 but it's just not true that he doesn't pay tax

 no what would you say this guy has inherit 1010 million

 p

 so he's worth 10 billion ps

 what would you say will be the total

 amount

 of tax

 he will pay in his lifetime

 well i know that just the smallest

 if i make 10 million i pay 60% just one sec

 you're not you're talking about income versus the transfer of

 an estate so why why is it that the

 be 10 million p just you're comparing your income

 yeah versus the amount he inherited

 which is not a fair thing that's not income that's his income

 he inheritance is not income

 so wait wait wait wait wait wa so if i get given1 billion

 i don't pay any tax but if i work for10 billion i pay 60%

 well if you inherit

 this is the tax system that you want

 you'll end up in a system

 where the kids of the richual own everything

 that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying

 and that's fun because that's our kids you're not telling the truth about his

 let's support it let's have a tax system where your kids and my kids and steven's

 kids are multimillionaires

 and

 these

 guys out there

 can't

 afford

 to feed

 their kids

 and put the heat in

 that's not what i'm saying

 but that's what you will get

 that is what you will get that's listen

 that's what i'm betting on that's fine because i'll make money in the markets

 it's fine and you'll make money and you'll make money

 it's our viewers who will be poor and that's fine

 that's fine that's fine for us let's let's explore the other alternative

 right so let's say tax the rich

 right so let's play the game of tax the rich

 tax the owners

 not the workers

 the owners

 so the issue that we have with the rich

 is that is the number one most valuable assets in the economy now in tangible assets

 so there's this chart called the s&p 500 of the 500

 richest countries in the country in the world in the us sorry

 um in 1970s 75% of the value of the s&p 500 was physical assets like property

 um and today it's less than 10%

 it's closer to 5%

 you think that housing is not particularly important

 just just let's stick stick with what i'm saying

 okay

 the the the powerhouse the engine room of the economy is digital assets

# Chapter 5

 is that is the number one most valuable assets in the economy now in tangible assets

 so there's this chart called the s&p 500 of the 500

 richest countries in the country in the world in the us sorry

 um in 1970s 75% of the value of the s&p 500 was physical assets like property

 um and today it's less than 10%

 it's closer to 5%

 you think that housing is not particularly important

 just just let's stick stick with what i'm saying

 okay

 the the the powerhouse the engine room of the economy is digital assets

 and that's reflected in

 the s&p 500 for example which is 95%

 intangible assets

 one of the issues that we have is that the richest people are completely

 mobile

 now

 so they can be absolutely

 anywhere in the world

 so if you come up with this idea of let's tax richest people 1%

 if a tiny proportion of them leave

 we're all in trouble

 so this really rich guys m

 what do they own

 companies

 and why are those companies worth money

 because investors say they are and where do the revenues come from globally

 okay the issue is is that these companies operate globally now so

 take my company for example

 my company has 8,000 customers in 150

 countries

 okay we could be anywhere if you p what country is your biggest single revenue source

 probably the us now

 let's say you move to cayman

 island

 and the us says we're going to tax your revenue at point of sale

 m what can you do

 well that's different right because that's not taxing billionaires that's taxing

 companies

 see when you say tax the rich on their wealth

 yeah that's different to saying tax companies a consumption tax

 oh but you just said the're rich owned companies

 you said that's what they own yeah but you're saying

 how do you tax them right so do they do you tax their wealth

 which is what they own

 or do you tax the companies where they trade

 um typically consumption taxes get passed on to consumers

 it's not consumption tax it's the tax on the ownership

 yeah but if you simply say when you're doing revenues

 then that's a consumption we start to tax

 if we start to taxit

 by the way i'm not exactly against you on on companies i think it's disgusting

 that a british company

 can can take out a facebook ad to sell to a british

 consumer

 a british product and facebook pretends to be in ireland on that transaction

 um and amazon you can buy something on amazon in britain from a british supplier

 from a british warehouse

 and amazon pretends to be in luxembourg

 in that situation

 and that sucks right like that that does not seem

 fair and it strikes me as very strange that the government

 is okay with that right now the government is chasing

 down

 moms and dads who sell a few things on ebay

 and chasing them for taxes but they don't talk to ebay

 they they they're paranoid

 about someone

 doing a little bit of a side hustle on facebook

 but facebook's

 fine to pretend to be an ireland

 so i don't agree with all of all of that right like i think where

 missing some serious tricks here

 but the idea

 with

 taxing

 billionaires at wealth

 billionaires will just leave they just get up and leave and and not just billionaires

 but what the billionaires

 own what the billionaires own companies

 and where do companies get their money from revenues

 and where do the revenues come from

 purchasing

 people purchasing where do those people live

 all over the world

 we can tax them at that point

 that's consumption tax this is the thing that's a consumption

 tax

 no it's not it's

 v

 is a tax on revenue

 tax these guys on

 profits based on where the revenues

 come from

 so

 it's very easy to move profits

 internationally

 see steven had a

 starbucks cup when he buys that starbucks

 yeah it's bought from a british company

 who licenses the starbucks logo

 from luxembourg or somewhere like that so 15%

 so here we are saying oh we're going to tax their profits

 they say ah i wish we were profitable

 sorry

 unfortunately we had to do that licensing deal with that international

 i know how profit shifting works okay so are you you think are you telling

 me

 compan selling to

 the uk the us enormous amount of of profit in the us

 and they turn around and say actually our profit is not in the us

 the difference you think the us

 is in is is incapable

 of going and looking if that's seeing

 where they really where the profit is i'm not saying

 that you can't

 do

 this

 i'm saying

 that the benefits

 of doing it it's so hard to tax

 wealth for example or it's so hard to tax

 millionaires and billionaires

 that that you end up cutting off your nose despite your face

 um for every

 like if we britain for example

 and we build a brand

 which is that we're anti- wealth

 we don't want you to ever have more than 10 million

 if you've got more than 10 million we punish you

 every young entrepreneur

 who comes to me and says dan do you think i should start a company

 here in this country

 i'm going to say well if you do

 they'll take it

 as soon as you start to make it they'll take it

 as soon as if you're successful

 if you get investment

 they're going to tax you at your wealth

 if you sell the company they're going to take it off you

 i'm going to basically say to that young entrepreneur

 don't build your business in brit go start it somewhere that they're more proactive

 and positive towards entrepreneurs

 are we seeing that now with this they call it the millionaire exodus

 which is

 for people that don't know the uk has set to lose the greatest proportion of millionaires

 in the world

 um this parliament i'll put a graph on the screen which is this one here

 this one here

 and that little red line here is

 us losing all of our millionaires at the moment and in 2024 it's an estimated

 that 10,800

 high net worth individuals left the uk which is

 57%

 increase from the previous year which means that 1 millionaire is departing every 45 minutes

 the uk millionaire

 exodus

 is equal to losing 530,000 average

 taxpayers

 and another stat

 the top 10% of earners in the us account for nearly half of all consumer spending

 the top 1% of income taxpayers in the uk are projected to contribute

 about 30% of total income tax from 2024 to

 2025

 why are all these millionaires running away

 well it's not because they're taxing their world because we don't have any wealth taxes

 why why do you think they're leaving

 i think the reason they're leaving is because the uk economy is is really really weak

 because the uk consumer is really really weak because you've absolutely crushed the spending power

 of your average british family

 your average british family

 can barely afford to feed the kids and turn the heating on

 so why are you going to start a business

 here

 when the customers are absolutely impoverished

 look it corresponds with a new tax that we brought in which was

 um we ended the non-dom scheme

 so the non-dom scheme basically said if you're living in the uk

 but you've got businesses all over the world

 then we only tax you on what you've got in the uk

 um and if you die in the uk

 we'll only tax you on your uk assets for inheritance tax if you're a non-dom

 but if you die in the uk and you've got wealth in india

 once that nonon

 scheme ended

 they basically said we will tax you on everything globally

 if you're an economic

 if you're a tax resident in the uk

 everything you've got globally we want 40% of it so unfortunately every wealth manager

 contacted their clients and said you can't stay here you're going to have to get out

 um it's it's gotten really bad a th000 people a month are leaving

 and

 in the uk 1% of people pay 30%

 of the taxes 10% of people pay 60%

 of the taxes

 and you imagine

 if we're sitting out at dinner

 and there's 10 of us out to dinner

 and one person says hey i've got this i get i'll get 60%

 of the bill tonight we say to them no it should be 70% should be 80%

 and they say you know what i'll get up and leave so they leave

 everyone else's bill just doubled

 so what's going to happen is if we drive the millionaires out of this country

 everyone

 every ordinary

 normal

 person

 who pays

 10 grand

 a year in tax

 will now have to pay

 20

 grand

 a year in tax

 so the reason they left because we used to allow them to not pay tax

 and we ta on their global incomes

 on their global

 isn't it a bit more like if we were 10 of us at dinner

 and there was one guy

 who

 came on to dinner on the condition he wouldn't pay their leaves

 because these guys weren't paying tax anyway

 the reason they left is because they weren't paying tax

 it's like saying

 um

 it's like saying

 hey i'll pay 60%

 of this table and they say at the table

 hey wait a second

 we also want you to pay for

 everything that's happening at other restaurants as well isn't it a bit more like

 these guys we're stretching

 on a condition you you yourself said

 the reason why they left

 is because we let them live here

 on the condition that they didn't have to pay taxes

 on their global

 yeah taxes matter right so why why is everyone going to dubai

 dubai they're going there because there's no tax

 these guys

 they live in dubai

 their money comes from the west

 they are making money

 from the west while your average western

 ordinary person watching this show now

 cannot afford to buy a house cannot afford to have a family

 we can tax those revenues at the point of sale why do we allow these

 it's a called a consumption tax no it's not it's a tax on

 tax on profit

 not tax on consumption

 you just said at point of sale which means it's a consumption

 tax based on the profits

 you look at how much profit

 they

 where the profits exactly it's not consumption tax what i'm saying so

 no so if you tax profits

 yeah right then those profits

 have to accumulate in that country and because of the digital

 ecosystem that we now have the world we now live in

 i can lease the database off of my company in luxembourg i can

 license the i can license my logo from understand how profit shifting

 listen these guys are not gandal you just say we don't accept profit shifting

 we don't need to accept profit shifting china does not accept profit shifting

 we did not accept profit shifting

 50 years ago we do not have to accept profit shifting

 but you have

 a government class who are extremely wealthy and a media class are extremely wealthy saying

 it's impossible to tax rich people and i would like to say

 i will agree 100%

 it is difficult to tax rich people it is very

 very very difficult to tax rich people

 i don't i don't come here saying i want to tax rich people because it's easy

 i know it's hard

 i know probably i'm going to lose

 i know our viewers

 kids will live in desperate poverty i know that

 i do this because it is hard

 if we are a country

 which says to ourselves we don't try and do things which are necessary

 to keep our kids out of poverty

 because they are hard

 then our kids will live in poverty i don't need to be here i'm a multimillionaire

 just like you i could be in the philippines drinking panac laders

 i come in here because i come from a poor background

 and it's ordinary families like my family

 like the kids i grew up with whose kids are going to be in poverty

 it's

 difficult but it is

 necessary

 sometimes we have to do things not because they're easy but because

 they are hard that is what makes a rich country rich and that is what protects

 ordinary people listen our grandparents lived in poverty

 did they say let's not change it because it's hard no they didn't

 they fought

 and they demanded

 they demanded health care education

 housing food and they got it they got it that's why my parents

# Chapter 6

 difficult but it is

 necessary

 sometimes we have to do things not because they're easy but because

 they are hard that is what makes a rich country rich and that is what protects

 ordinary people listen our grandparents lived in poverty

 did they say let's not change it because it's hard no they didn't

 they fought

 and they demanded

 they demanded health care education

 housing food and they got it they got it that's why my parents

 could live a good quality life

 they got those things they got those things and they were aware

 that in order to do that you could not allow

 the super

 rich

 who have been living lives of luxury

 for hundreds and hundreds of years

 to eat

 everything

 while ordinary

 families couldn't afford to feed their kids

 i know it's

 difficult i know it's

 difficult and i know i'm probably going to lose

 i know that i know i'm probably going to lose

 and that means our viewers will be poor but i do it anyway

 because i do not want this country that i grew up in to fall into desperate

 poverty

 i agree with you on the passion and i agree with you on the problem

 i don't agree with you on the solution because in 2019

 we be kids in 2020 and that's not what i'm saying in 2020

 we made a decision globally to shut down the economy

 and we taught

 everyone that they can live and work from anywhere

 the biggest threat to everything you're saying is remote working

 the fact that we can live and work work from anywhere our grandparents

 their boss if their boss owned a company

 that company

 had to physically

 be in the country and the boss had to physically be in the country

 if we look at today

 there are plenty of fitness trainers who work for a gym

 and the owner of that gym is somewhere overseas

 plenty of people work in live

 work in a restaurant

 and the owner of the restaurant

 lives overseas

 you can live in you can run a business from anywhere in the world right now

 so the problem that we face

 is that you're describing

 on one

 hand you say

 we need to tax it at the point of sale which is a consumption

 tax

 and not tax on profit okay and then you say a tax on profit

 and then you say

 oh

 but then we'll stop

 profit shifting

 by the way i'm also

 actually all for this idea of

 stopping

 profit

 i i've already said i think it's utterly

 ridiculous

 the way that many of these global companies are treated

 and if we don't

 stop

 that

 then all the money just flows

 out to the tech companies

 um so i'm i'm with you on that but when you say tax the rich

 the actual people who own the companies

 those people can

 be anywhere right now so but but their revenues

 can't their customers

 their customers are where their customers are

 their customers are where their customers are

 listen amazon doesn't pay any uk tax doesn't pay any us tax where are the customers

 in the uk and us in uk

 us

 do you really think it's impossible for us to tax that well you're talking about taxing

 people at 10 million

 plus right

 so this is a lot of startup entrepreneurs

 jeff bez is a lot more than 10 million jez

 jeff worth a lot more than you talk about

 anyone above 10 million is on your radar you don't want people worth

 11 million pounds we pay more i'm not just talk

 it's not that

 dan if you you you're worth more than 10 million pounds so if we tax people

 on

 as gary says that have more than 10 million what are your options

 to avoid say if your objective was to avoid that

 what options do you have look if if my objective was to

 avoid it i pass a board resolution that we're moving the head office somewhere else yeah

 um we move the intellectual property somewhere else

 i pick up and move my family somewhere else

 and within

 about a week or two we've got a we

 work office

 somewhere else

 i've got a new house

 on airbnb

 somewhere else

 and i cut ties with the uk

 and i'm non- tax resident

 here and i can

 i have a digital business

 i can literally make my head office anywhere in the world

 if there was a particular country that turned hostile towards

 our operations they not have to withdraw service from that thing

 you know so that that's possible but it's unlikely that that would actually happen

 but ultimately if i choose to get up and leave then i get up and leave

 now

 the the the bigger issue is would i have even come here in the first place

 and then there's another issue and here's the other issue gary for you

 you've just had 750,000

 subscribers to your youtube channel 820 it's 8:20 right so it's going up fast

 i could have

 one of my analysts at a consulting company do valuation of your brand

 and do valuation of your youtube channel

 we could say this is a fast growth media company

 and it's worth

 11 million

 right so we could come up with a forecast

 and a projection and we say gary's

 economics

 is actually a new fast growth media brand it's worth 11 million

 now your channel

 now you have to pay 100 grand a year in extra taxes

 because you're a millionaire

 sorry 1%

 on wealth above

 10 million on 11 million is going to be 10 grand taxes

 oh you're saying only on the part above that's how

 taxes work so it's not on everything

 it's

 okay so it's a it's a marginal tax that's how taxes work

 it's

 so okay so but is it fair

 that like who gets to decide what wealth is wealth and what it's worth because wealth

 let's just hit me out wealth is a a technical term for unrealized

 gains

 right it's not real

 you know someone buys a house for 20 grand and it's worth 200 grand

 they've still got the same house but now they've got wealth

 um if someone starts a business

 and a tiny little seed investor

 puts in a little angel

 investment

 now they've got wealth on paper but who gets to say what is wealth

 um like for example

 if you introduce wealth taxes theoretically

 that will actually

 reduce the value of wealth of things anyway

 because

 things in inside that economy

 are now subject to a disadvantage

 so therefore investors will be unlikely to invest in them to a certain point

 and also

 people start

 cutting and dodging and weaving and ducking and weaving so they say oh our uk operations

 worth 10 million so we're now going to start

 a second company over in some other country and make sure that

 that's where the wealth accumulates

 so it's incredibly

 difficult because it is just unrealized

 gains

 i know i know it's difficult

 yeah i know i know these guys have the best accountants

 i i know it's difficult i know so what if there was an easier

 solution

 if there was an easier

 solution

 i would support

 that you know what i mean it's called it's called economic

 freedom

 the economic

 freedom

 index

 okay well

 just tell the viewers

 that give them more economic

 freedom and then they'll be rich

 yeah so this

 this diagram

 here basically says

 the most free

 countries

 have less than 10% poverty in fact less than 7% poverty

 as soon as you reduce economic freedom it jumps to 30%

 poverty you reduce economic freedom again and it jumps up to huge huge amounts of poverty

 so

 the these countries here are the least economically

 free and these countries are the most economically

 free

 the countries that get in the way of your economic

 freedom

 have more poverty and the countries that let people make decisions for their own life

 what you're saying is

 if the governments of our countries cut taxes on us the three multimillionaire

 sitting at this table

 that will improve the lives of

 the ordinary british and american

 give a real life example to feed their kids i'll give you a real life example

 i know of a company

 that was going to give pay rises to its employees

 and then national insurance went up and instead of national insurance is a tax on employment

 yeah

 i'm saying to reduce that i'm saying to reduce tax on i want your viewers

 the viewers

 here to be paying less tax

 while multimillionaires pay more tax good in theory

 but

 of if you could tax rich people 1% of their wealth above 10 million

 i did a back of a napkin cap

 calculation you might be able to get 20 billion

 yeah

 right that's if they don't leave that's if they don't respond

 to it if they just happily pay it you get 20 billion

 that's less than a week worth of current government spending

 so the government's out of control 1.2

 trillion a year of government spending is now what they spend

 okay so let's cut that get that 20 billion

 and cut the taxes

 for

 the viewers

 cut their income tax so that works out about 250 a year

 okay so let's do more let's make it 60 billion

 so then you tax 3%

 above wealth yeah do that right and then you also bring it down

 this is what governments do make five or six

 yeah and then and that's what they did

 that's what they did in the second

 world

 war and that's why my dad could afford

 a house

 actually that's not why you could afford a house

 okay well

 who's buy if ordinary people are losing their houses and the wealth which they are yeah

 and we're getting richer

 yeah who is it who is now owning the houses if it is not us

 the government used to own the houses and then they sold the government wealth is collapsing

 government wealth is collapsing but what they did

 is they sold the houses to the people

 okay but but

 ordinary middle

 is also you can only do that once

 and they did it for the baby

 so you think it's our viewers who have got my houses now

 who

 where is the wealth

 going

 daniel

 where is the wealth going who has the wealth now who is getting rich

 who is getting the wealth that is lost by our viewers

 i'll tell you where the biggest amounts of money are going the biggest amounts of money

 since the pandemic

 11 trillion went just to the value of seven companies that own te technology

 so the biggest seven companies in the usa

 11 trillion

 has and you don't want their billionaire owners to pay more tax

 well would that help the uk

 well if you use that money to reduce tax on working

 people then it it would help yeah they

 own shares in the usa they're us citizens

 so that doesn't help us here

 but it will help the american

 consumer

 and then we can export the american consumer

 and it will mean the american consumer

 has money

 and then it will show

 british

 people

 how much you can achieve

 by taxing super rich we can raise tax on our super rich here

 and then

 what i want is these guys to be taxed so much that they start to sell

 assets

 and then ordinary

 british people can buy assets again because what i want is our viewers

 to be able to own things

 to be able to own their own homes

 i when i hear this

 um i

 admissibly

 don't know as much about these issues as you guys do but

 when i hear that there's these seven

 tech companies in the us my brain goes can't we have one here yeah yeah

 can't we start

 and then so my brain goes how what conditions do we have to create

 ones that we had

 yeah what conditions do we have to create

 to have one of those seven

 tech companies here especially

 in this sort of ai world we're heading towards

 where when i was reading through the stats

 most of the investment in ai

 which is going to be hugely destabilizing

 across every industry from driving to to

 any form of knowledge work even podcasting

 i can play your podcast now yeah which sounds exactly like me which has a 4.6

 star rating on apple which was written by ai in my voice published by ai

 wild

 and the and who's acing

 the value there well it's a company in america

 called 11

 labs

 and it's bloody

 open ai

 and i

 why

 why can't we have those companies here we need them here because china

 and the us are dominating

 this next

 revolution

 um and i i worry as a bystander that if we don't create entrepreneurship

 friendly

 environments

 here

 we're going to we are going to become indian yeah m so you

 if you want businesses that to thrive

 you don't need just a good environment for entrepreneurs

 you also need people to have money that they can spend

# Chapter 7

 this next

 revolution

 um and i i worry as a bystander that if we don't create entrepreneurship

 friendly

 environments

 here

 we're going to we are going to become indian yeah m so you

 if you want businesses that to thrive

 you don't need just a good environment for entrepreneurs

 you also need people to have money that they can spend

 mh

 and we are in a country where increasingly

 most of the people out there have almost

 nothing left over at the end of the month

 they can barely pay the bills

 those companies are selling globally

 right so they don't need any particular

 company to do well they just they sell to anywhere

 so like open ai chat gpt

 we're all using that bloody product and pay our 20 $30

 a month

 yeah where do they actually get their money

 from

 right they get their money from selling

 data

 to to to the rich

 right

 my point was making the environment more friendly for entrepreneurs because when i start a company

 i am at a i can't explain the disadvantage

 i'm at at the moment if i start

 that kind of company here in the uk there's no investors

 and then all the talent seems to flock over to san francisco

 so the the guys that built

 the british guys that built

 an ai company called fixer

 which i was going to invest in all british lads from london

 they went over to san francisco they're like 25y

 olds they've just raised at a 60 million valuation

 they're in this room

 this building in san francisco full of entrepreneurs

 and they're pumping knowledge and capital into this room

 with all due respect stephen

 you're not a great example for the fact that it's impossible

 to start

 a successful online brand in the uk

 facts

 um

 but i also realized that the problem of of but he started when things were different

 but i i also realized

 i don't like using personal examples

 because there's a huge amount of privilege and

 okay is there a chat gbt in germany

 no is there a chat gbt in in france

 no is there a chat gpt in australia

 no no is there a chat gpt in ja

 it's china and one sec sec yeah exactly

 what you have here is an extremely

 low labor

 extremely

 high capital model which employs

 extremely

 few people across the entire world

 that is focused in

 basically two cities

 yeah

 good luck competing with that h how do we create an environment where the uk

 can start to build some of these companies

 which are going to capitalize

 on this next technological

 revolution

 how if you were prime minister what would you do

 i think you need to look realistically

 about what companies do we have a chance of growing

 you know i'm not an expert in ai

 but i think trying to compete with san francisco

 in london would

 will probably

 not work

 why try try and do it you know try and do it and listen

 i know

 that you can get a lot of likes saying

 let's just invest

 in ai

 let's just invest

 only one city in the world outside of china has managed

 it

 china has managed it by basically state

 capitalism

 you know this is very similar in a sense to what we had with micro electronics

 in japan in the 8s

 right when you have a new industry

 especially these industries which are very capital intense and don't employ many people

 you get a first move advantage they tend to win eventually

 often they get undercut

 by cheaper rivals

 and that does happen you know that does happen and you might stand in ai

 i don't think ai is going to become

 a massive massive

 employer

 of course you know a lot of countries are going to be like because basically

 it sounds good we're going to invest in i we're going to invest in ai

 personally i think we should be looking at what does the british person need

 you know we live in a country where the housing stock is falling apart

 if if we say ai

 when we talk about ai i think we're actually talking about technology

 because even a podcast

 like a podcast like this you don't think this

 of this as an ai company

 but actually now the editing process the scripting process the transcription

 process even youtube itself is an ai company

 so

 it's it's really technology

 we're speaking about here and i'm wondering why we can't create a better environment

 in the uk

 to start launching

 and building some of these technology

 companies we've even seen i think we should and i think we should be looking

 we should be look at reducing

 taxes

 on people who

 who work and make money this is what i've been saying for the whole time

 what about people what about people who start companies

 yeah we should reduce

 their taxes on the income that they make

 but then if they start owning a50

 million pound company

 are you telling me

 if you come to me and i say all right you want to start a company

 we we tax you very very little on a company that you start

 if that company becomes

 worth 20 30 40 million quid

 then we're going to start taxing

 you you're going to come and say to me oh no sorry

 50 million is not enough for me so can i ask a question on that so

 um my company was was valued at x 50 whatever 100 millions

 um congratulations i still had

 because i hadn't had an exit event yeah i still had

 101,000

 20,000

 in my bank account

 are you saying

 at the point when i sell the company

 or are you saying just because i have shares from the company

 i think

 you can structure

 it a number of ways you can structure

 a number of ways

 my preferred

 way is to stop people

 from

 hoarding

 enormous a of wealth for enormous amounts of time that's my

 that's basically my preferred method

 there's also the wealth tax method

 there's also

 capital gains

 as a method there's a lot of different ways it there's a lot of different ways

 but you have to deal with the problem

 of

 if you do not do not tax very wealthy individuals

 and very wealthy families

 their share of the pie will obviously goow over time

 and they will and they are as we are watching

 squeezing our ordinary families

 you have to deal with that my friend sold his company in the uk

 it's a company everybody

 knows

 um and he

 i remember

 him saying to me at the time it was in the middle of the pandemic

 he got this big exit event i think he'd made 300 million

 and he goes i'm off

 i go where you going he goes i'm going to go to

 dubai

 in monaco

 and live between the two

 and i i said

 explain

 to me why he goes well the amount of tax

 i'd have to pay in the uk

 is equivalent

 to me paying 20 million rent in the uk

 for the next six or seven years

 which he'd have to stay here for

 so he

 he went and he pops back in

 every now and then but it meant that he could keep that

 150

 million whatever tax he would pay

 never had to pay it to the uk is living this

 highflying life now in dubai drops into monaco every now and then

 um

 and i remember him saying to me well steve

 i'd have to pay 20 million

 rent

 a year to live here and he

 went on to say the uk

 product

 is just isn't worth it

 he goes crime

 i'm going to get my rolex

 robbed off me

 he goes

 um the healthare

 system isn't the best the education

 system isn't necessarily

 the best

 and the particular one was crime

 which is i'll get i'll get i'll get mugged walking through

 yeah london streets

 stephen

 if you allow british people who own 300 million pound of british assets

 to

 technically live in monaco and not pay tax

 then you will get crime

 and you will have

 dirty streets

 and you will have a bad health care system and you will have education

 because if you give all of the wealth to a group of people

 who do not tax

 there will be nothing left to provide

 things like healthcare and education

 for ordinary people

 it's not unconnected

 these people are not technically

 living there they're moving

 out my friends have

 moved

 out of the country they don't come back to the uk

 they've left and they leave with their they built a company here

 they

 glob

 p tax they typically build globally business it's not that they p it was a global

 they don't pay no tax they pay extortionate

 amounts of tax

 right anyone who's here is paying extraordinary

 taxes more than they've ever paid before 1% pays 30%

 10% pays 60% of

 1 trillion a year gu 300 million how much tax rec he's paid in his life

 i have no idea

 i have no idea

 his business was global that his biggest customer was the us it's i pay 60%

 and our viewers will pay 30 40 50%

 do you think it's fair that your 300

 million guy pays his two or three

 i have no idea what he

 pays

 well it sounds like he didn't pay 50%

 well he dashed when before he got the tax bill

 but why did we allow it

 why did we allow

 i i'm not allowed to not pay my tax

 what could you have done

 to you are allowed

 to

 when you were in japan

 you wouldn't have paid uk

 taxes

 yeah because i was working in japan

 and i pay japanese taxes because you're living in japan

 this is the thing people can live wherever they want now so but

 we're talking about this is

 i think we should stop obfuscating

 tax on people's work from tax on the ass they

 so i'm talking about entrepreneurs work generates wealth

 so when if i if i ear a billion pound of british houses

 yeah and then i say i live in dubai yeah and i'm getting

 the rent on a billion pounds of houses which would probably be something like like

 that's going to be something like 50 million

 a year so i'm getting 60 50 60 million a year of rent from british people

 yeah and that gets paid to me from british people

 yeah

 and i pay and i don't pay tax i live in dubai

 do you think that's fair

 no

 all right so let's change that let's let's make people pay tax on

 on their world regardless where they live yeah the question would be though

 how would you tax people right and how would you actually structure it because

 regardless

 of what you feel like is fair

 this is the thing

 it's not about fairness

 it's about what you can pragmatic

 and practically do in the modern economy

 you might say oh i actually like for example if we said what's fair

 a lot of people would say a flat tax is fair

 you make one pound you pay 20%

 you make a million pounds you pay 20%

 make 100 million pounds you pay 20%

 so a lot of people would say the fairest

 tax system would just be a flat tax on everything

 right that would be a fair thing it's pragmatically

 can you do it is it actually good for society

 should people be excluded from that so it's not about fairness it's about pragmatically

 what can you get away with

 all right well pragmatically

 what we can get away with is desperate poverty for our viewers kids

 if you want to have

 can we zoom out just a minute

 right i want to zoom out let's zoom away from our viewers

 kids

 forget about them they're not

 i got i'm a dad right i got three kids you're you are a multimillionaire

 dad you probably don't have the same problems as our viewers do you know that

 do you know that kids born into the top have a 60%

 chance of dropping out of the top

 right 60%

 that's the number it's called persistence you can google it

 um the persistence rates is actually only 40%

 for the richest

 so which means 60%

 drop out in the second

 you think kids have a 60%

 chance of living in poverty pos not poverty

 do you know what's interesting

 we're all trying to aim at the same goal

 i think here

 i'm not sure we are but well

 that's fair

 that's fair maybe we're not i suspect

 some of us are maybe trying to protect

 our

 kids

 i want widespread affluence through the technological

 revolution that's happening

 and i don't want the people who create that

 to want to go somewhere else so you agree with me

 that we should cut tax on wealth creators and raise tax on wealth

 orders

 well broadly

 okay so let's do it let's cut on people who are making

 let cut tax on people who are working hard creating a good product

 making a good income

 and let's raise tax on people who are sitting there on 20 30 40

 100

 200 500 million pounds of assets

 that they're going to give to their kids and they're going to use to dominate

 society

 and squeeze out the middle class so who's an example

 of someone who's hoarding

 wealth

 she so his family owns a tech company

 his

 wife's dad owns a tech compan

 which he will inherit and his kids will inherit

 his net worth

 that is quoted

 is based upon his wife's

 but that company already exists

 yeah it's created now yeah

 it's worth billions but they they have to reinvent that business every two years

 like it's a so you think that the reason you think that if r's father-in-law

 stopped managing the company it would be valueless

# Chapter 8

 wife's dad owns a tech compan

 which he will inherit and his kids will inherit

 his net worth

 that is quoted

 is based upon his wife's

 but that company already exists

 yeah it's created now yeah

 it's worth billions but they they have to reinvent that business every two years

 like it's a so you think that the reason you think that if r's father-in-law

 stopped managing the company it would be valueless

 no i think it it

 it

 hires

 hundreds

 of thousands of people

 and

 it's you know it's a big company i don't know a lot about that particular

 company but i know it's a tech company

 steve jobs died

 okay

 is apple valueless

 no let's not pretend

 that these creators are the sole

 reason these companies are are valuable

 sure you know and what we're talking about in many cases

 you know i was a trader okay

 and

 i'm worth a millions

 of quid

 and

 you know now

 that is just

 assets

 i just own the assets

 i own the assets

 and that will grow and it will grow and it will grow and it will grow

 and that will squeeze out and squeeze out and squeeze out and squeeze out our viewers

 and i'll give that to my kids

 they don't even need to work

 they wouldn't even

 have even have to work they could just live on

 i could live on off the

 wealth

 is that what you want do

 do you think there are any opportunities

 for people today like if you're born into a poor family

 do you think it's possible

 that housing being

 and we can both agree agree on that but do you think there are new opportunities

 that didn't exist for our parents or grandparents but they do exist for people today

 i think the reality is for kids from poor

 backgrounds

 it is almost

 impossible

 to realistically

 get even financial security

 never mind wealth but why do you think

 you could do it i could do it he could do it

 but you don't think other people could do

 it

 well the first thing is i'm 38 now so i'm not not a kid nowadays

 um listen

 i want every mass competition

 i've ever been in

 you know what i mean

 since

 i was a

 little

 kid

 i didn't

 even

 have a

 desk

 in my

 house

 you know

 i was one of the top students at

 lc

 and i still had to win my job by cheating in a card game

 you know that's the world that we live in i don't think that's a very replicable

 strategy

 and it's very easy for people like us who've made money

 to say oh ar we did it aren't we great go out and you know

 you've said that you think if young people go and work in tech business

 they can get financial security

 if it was that easy

 they'd all be doing it you know they're not idiots

 our viewers

 are not idiots

 they're trying trying

 they're trying

 they want to find the good opportunities

 and they work listen i speak

 i'm the one saying they're idiots you're the one who says

 that they can't do it anymore

 i i see people do it all the time like i'm working in entrepreneurs

 people from poor backgrounds

 and so so then so but then why are i vi you think all of our

 if it was that easy why is everybody

 not doing it i'll tell you why people aren't doing it we went through a schooling

 system

 that taught us how to get an office job

 okay right we went through a schooling system to prepare us for a

 a world that doesn't really exist anymore which is the industrial revolution world

 and you have to go through a process of figuring out how it really works

 so

 what what i see is

 the most often the people who do really well financially

 who are young

 they dropped out of school they dropped out of university they started learning

 how to do things

 by doing their own research they start their own business or co-found a business

 they take a very alternative

 path

 none of that was taught to us at school

 none of it's taught to us in normal society

 we have a school system that manufactures

 people for a set of skills that are not particularly valuable anymore

 and we also get them in debt for those skills

 um when people sid step that

 and say okay i'm not going to get into university

 debt i'm just going to go off and actually figure out how the world works

 there's actually loads of

 opportunities

 okay so

 i guess we've sorted it then all our viewers need to do

 is go and buy dan's book

 become an entrepreneur

 and become a millionaire

 it's that easy

 why w you guys doing it to begin with they're idiots

 the viewers are idiots

 they should be just being more entrepreneurial

 it's as simple as that more entrepreneurial

 start a business listen i come from east london okay my friends

 can't feed their kids

 okay

 and if it was as simple as going out and be an entrepreneur

 i can bet you they would do it

 i can bet you they would do it let us

 i'm sick of multi-millionaires

 telling

 kids

 who can't afford to turn the heating on you just need to be more entrepreneurial

 it's sick dan it's sick

 i this gives people mental illness

 it gives people mental illness tell them the truth okay we your older generation

 we took the opportunities

 and now is almost impossible to out of poverty

 and don't just don't just stand up and wave

 you know your millions

 of pounds in front of them and say if you entrepreneurial

 like me you could do it you could have it because it's sick because they can't

 they can't feed their kids down

 they can't turn the heating on don't tell them to be more entrepreneurial

 fix the system that drives more and more and more of them into poverty every generation

 i find it very strange

 that you think it would be easier to fix the entire global economic

 system

 than to start a business

 and fix your own personal

 economics

 the the thing that

 the thing that i know that gives people mental health issues

 is feeling that they have no agency in their life that they can't do anything

 your video where you talk about if you don't have a rich dad you're screwed

 there's no such thing as meritocracy

 you're never going to be successful

 to me

 if i had have come across your content

 at 19

 20 years old i would have been screwed

 i was so i'm so glad

 that i came across people who said

 daniel you weren't born into a

 a rich family you don't have any bank of mom and dad

 but it's cheap and easier than ever to start a business

 start by working for someone who's got a business then figure out what's your opportunity

 and there's a way there is a way

 i've actually worked with a lot of teenagers from poor backgrounds

 and one of the things we do is we

 tell them if it's possible for someone else it is possible for you

 um i also worked in rural uganda

 um with a charity that did work with the poorest of the poor

 um one of the most incredible things i ever saw was a woman who started

 out

 literally picking food out of a trash

 pile

 um and she was

 basically

 sh

 they they shared

 with her how to start a chicken

 business

 which then ended up as a pig business

 which then ended up as a cattle business

 and she ended up

 making

 hiring 15 16 people in her local community

 the power of entrepreneurship is that starting with nothing you can

 actually

 make improvements

 i'm not saying everyone ends up as a millionaire and i'm not saying everyone ends up

 equal

 but i'm saying you can make improvements

 in your life and the thing that causes mental health issues

 is the feeling of having no agency or no control over your circumstances

 until the world changes the whole economic

 system

 i never told people don't work hard i never once said that never once said that

 never said that you said if your dad wasn't rich you'll never be rich

 which is true in 99.9%

 of cases i've never told people don't work hard true 99%

 i've never told people don't work hard okay and listen if you think that ugandans

 should be more entrepreneurial

 i've never been to uganda

 maybe that's the problem out there maybe that's the problem in nigeria

 maybe that's the problem in india listen

 i've never said don't work hard

 okay

 when i brought my book out last year

 the hardback

 i was at some event and i come out i was drinking london bridge

 and i come out late it was like it was like 1:00 a.m.

 and

 um

 some guy come up to me when i was unlocking my bike

 some guy from newcastle

 which is the northeast

 of england it's this quite a poor town there's a lot of workingclass

 people there

 and

 um he said i've been watching you on youtube and um i love your stuff and

 um

 this guy started crying this guy start crying on the street right in front of me

 he's like i work so hard gary i work two jobs

 um

 my mom's sick

 and i'm trying to help i'm trying to support and and i don't understand why

 and and i'm sorry that i'm

 crying

 but nobody ever told me that it wasn't my fault before

 that's what he said to me okay and listen listen

 i believe 100%

 aspiration

 ambition entrepreneurial

 spirit

 i would never say

 see a kid that has that and say turn it off

 okay

 but the flip side of your if you just work hard enough you can make it

 is if you didn't make it

 it's because you didn't work hard enough and it's your fault

 and i would like you to sit and think very hard

 before you send that message to young men and young women in our

 society meritocracy doesn't mean that everyone

 ends up with the same result

 what

 what i'm trying to

 what here's what i'm trying to achieve

 i'm trying to achieve

 the people who have ambition

 who can go for it are incentivized

 to do it and incentivized

 to build jobs and build companies

 about the ones

 that just want to work hard and

 have a good family

 and take care of them

 and have a home

 and be able to turn the heating on and be able to

 financial security they need to work for business don't they they need to work for you

 yeah

 p they need to work they need to work for a business

 some business

 right if someone doesn't create that business then where do they work for

 we now have by the way we now have 11%

 of 11% of working age people are now declared too sick to work

 right we have a huge problem in the uk

 we also have 25%

 of people who are working age don't work

 it's one in seven men don't work work at all do you think they're lazy dan

 i think the system is collapsing do you think think the system is average british american

 working is lazy what i think is happening

 is that the technology

 companies

 are totally transforming and disrupting everything

 um and what happened is around the post-war era we had good jobs we had

 um you could work in a local thing what's happening

 now is that jobs are going to the philippines

 they're going to

 techn technology does three things it makes jobs more simple which makes them replaceable

 it makes jobs global

 where you can move them to anywhere else

 and then ultimately

 it automates

 the job al together and gets rid of it

 through code and software

 and what's really going on in the last especially 5 years since the pandemic

 is technology

 has decimated the existing systems

 that we all relied upon when we grew up and when i say the

 education system isn't really working

 it's still pretending

 that there are office jobs available

 for people when they graduate and it's still pretending that there's like 1950

 scenarios available

 when actually

 my kids are going to be disrupted by ai

 everyone's kids are going to be disrupted by ai

 um

 you know

 these sorts of things are the are the things that really

 we

 we also need to be talking

 this is the moment where ai superpower

 meets human

 talent

 i i want to take this back to a point you were talking about earlier

 which is about personal

 agency

 because i would like you daniel to give the counter to your own argument

 because i want to make sure when we're talking about solutions to this problem

 start a business

 be

 entrepreneurial

 you can also understand how that might

 that works for people with our brains

 and our mindset and whatever we had that made us do that our risk appetite

 our trauma whatever it might be

 but not everybody

 is wide in such a way

 so that's not necessarily the best solution for

 and also we sit here with a bit of hindsight bias where we we were lucky

 and it worked out for us but when you look at the stats around businesses succeeding

 what you know the stat it's like 90% of businesses fail

 so most of them are failing

 the ones that emerge from that people like me

 then

 we have a bias where we go well it work for us you do it too

 i don't come from money so i have the same bias like i watched

 well i've i've built

 i've built from scratch several times because i got disrupted

 several times so i've had to start with nothing several times and build

 but you started

 type of person right and when we say start from nothing

 you actually started with a wealth of information

 and the whole game in building building

 capital

 intellectual

 capital having been through it before being around that mentor that gave you the information

 also having access to a great market

 like having

 access

 to a free

 market

 is is a big thing

 i was born in australia

 and i moved to london at the peak of london's

 economic freedom so this can't be broadly applicable

 advice

 can it

 well i think personal agency is broadly applicable

 the idea

 i got this friend of mine

 who

 woke up one day he went out clubbing

 went out to a nightclub

 felt sick collapsed

 woke up and they had chopped off all four limbs right so

 he

 had quadruple ampute

 um he was 19 years old so he wakes up in bed and he basically

 says

 i'm a quadruple

 ampute

 i was i was fine

 48 hours ago and now i'm a qu quadruple amputee

 and he decides to make this decision in the in the hospital room

 um that this is going to be the best thing that ever happened to him

 and he makes that decision right even that is a consequence

 of

 his him and his wiring

 what i'm trying to

 understand

 but he ended up he ended up starting

 a clinic

 and it's a multi-million

 dollar clinic

 i mean it's incredible what

 can do

 the rule

 it's incredible what people

 but you only need a few people to succeed

 and the whole economy starts to

 improve

 we we actually in this uk

 we only at the peak of our entrepreneurial

 like blitzing it where we're doing so well there was only 40,000 scale ups 40,000

 companies were creating jobs growth higher wages

 um investment into the company into the country

 you know it's only

 1%

 of people who pay 30%

 of the taxes

 and 10% of people who pay 60%

 of the taxes so you only need

 one in a 100

 to actually create something that's valuable and you get an extra 30% of taxes

 but so

 so that again is

 we need this one that

 advice for the what the people that end up getting into that 1%

 but who does everyone else work for

 like all jobs growth comes from entrepreneurs so what are you saying to those the 199%

 there are you saying go get a job

 well you you need wealth creators in the economy

 who are building something like you take

 um

 gym shark

 people who work at gym shark they're super glad that this guy started the company

 they're really happy that there's a company

 otherwise where would they go what would they work where would they work

 so if ben decides that he doesn't want to start that company in the uk

 um or if he gets to 10 million and stops

 then all of those additional jobs are are toast they're all gone so you encouraging

 the entrepreneurial

 you're not encouraging everyone to become an entrepreneur

 you're saying those that have those

 that bias or that i'm saying we need a system

 that encourages

 the people who can to do

 um and what about everybody else

 well every the flow on effect

 is that that creates

 jobs

 that creates wealth in the economy

 um and free markets lift everybody up

 um free markets just means that everyone's trading with everyone

 um

 you know it starts

 to like the whole thing i mean it's

 it's just a tail as oldest

 time as soon as economies

 are free

 and there are entrepreneurs

 starting things and growing things everyone's life improves everyone life get better

 um and what's your what part of that do you disagree with gary

 i think it's it doesn't work

 it doesn't work the only period listen the last 70 years are not normal stephen

 the last 70 years are not normal

 the last 70 years in europe and the us

 where ordinary

 people like my dad

 could work for the post office

 on less than average wage

 and buy a house and support family it's not normal

 it's not normal

 in the world and it's not normal in history

 most countries in the world do not like that

 most countries have a a small super rich elite

 and a very large group of extremely poor people that's most of the country

 and it's most of

 history in this country and it's most of history in the us

 you know

 yeah we talk about charles dickens i read hard times

 i read hard times and this is written in the 19th

 century

 when britain was like the industrial

 super

 of the whole world

 and at the time

 the government was talking about should we tax these industrialists

 and the industrialists were saying if you tax us we'll throw our factories into the sea

 and it just reminds me you know

 the only time we've ever really been able to provide

 decent living

 conditions for ordinary working people

 was the period after the war where we massively redistributed

 wealth and and now we're losing

 that

 that holding of wealth

 in of the middle class can you acknowledge

 though that that was a completely different time

 as it relates to being able to it was a different time but you

 i could you know of techy nigeria today brazil today

 the uk 300 years ago france 200 years ago there is only one specific

 time

 that we have ever successfully

 provided

 broad living standards for ordinary people and it was a period of time we protected

 a broadly

 equal wealth distribution

 and tax the rich at very high rates and you can acknowledge that that's

 extremely hard to do because the nature of the economy 100%

 100

 that's the reason why all of our grandparents and our great-grandparents

 and our great great grandparents lived in poverty and that's why i know

 i'm probably going to lose

 and that's why i bet

 on the economy

 getting worse

 and that's why i know poverty is going to increase

 because it was extremely

 difficult to get the unusually

 fair share for ordinary working people and i know we're losing the argument

 and i know that farage

 will win and i know that trump

 will win

 and i know

 that

 and i know that things will get

 worse

 i don't think i'm going to win

 so if you if you know you're

 promoting

 a a strategy

 that is not going to work and it sounds like you think is incredibly

 almost impossible then why would you not be more practical in your solution stephen

 if it was impossible i wouldn't be here

 think it's possible

 of course it's possible of course it's possible but you believe you're not going to win

 i'm a betting man steve

 i'm a betting man i put my bets on you know i am

 if i get okay look okay so my youtube channel is growing really really quickly

 and you know i'm obviously

 like starting a bit of a movement

 and there's a lot of political

 support and if it keeps growing we'll get more political

 support

 at the end of the day

 i'm trying to tax the richest and most powerful people in the world

 and most of these people

 will come out and attack

 me and they'll try and stop

 me

 and

 i do not have

 billions of pounds hundreds of millions of pounds to use to support my youtube channel

 i'm counting

 on ordinary people like your viewers to support and share my message

 now listen

 for most of history

 that has not worked and for most of history

 ordinary families live in poverty

 i don't think it's impossible

 that we ordinary people can win and get a fair share

 but i think it's worth fighting for steve so i fight for it anyway

 he's he's right that for most of history you've had the super elite

 and then everyone else is down here and it's massive wealth inequality is almost the normal

 for the last five thousand years and almost everywhere

 you've got kings queens dukes

 and peasants and surfs down there

 there have been economic

 situations that have been different

 dubai is a really strange situation

 it's a desert it's in inhospitable

 to live in

 it's the last

 place in the world most people would think or choose that they would want to be

 and yet it's one of the most economically

 rich places in the world right now

 they actually didn't start with oil wealth they were able to borrow money to build dubai

 but the low tax environment

 has now attracted raed some of the world's most talented

 people to go and build technology

 companies

 there

 and if you i don't know have you been there recently

 i've been to dubai

 few years ag now but i've been so at the moment

 it is the most

 thriving

 entrepreneurial

 community on earth outside of the us but probably even rivaling the us

 that there are investors there's entrepreneurs

 and the wealth is going through the roof

 um i've got two friends who are personal trainers fitness trainers

 one fitness trainer has decided to stop working

 more hours because he's hit 50 grand a year and he now gets taxed at 40%

 so he's basically decided he's going to earn right up to 50,000 and then stop working

 and then the other fitness trainer went to dubai

 launched an online fitness

 community and has just bought a $350,000 ferrari

 and one entrepreneur

 is super pumped and super excited about building a business because he's not over taxed

 the other entrepreneur

 has literally said

 i'm not

 willing

 to do this

 because of how much i have to pay

 just want to be clear

 i've always

 campaigned

 for lower taxes on rich

 on working people

 always always so but here's

 but here's the thing right if i was ask you

 you've just become

 one of the best selling authors

 in the country

 if your publisher came to you

 and said because you're in the top 1% of our authors

 we're going to harve your royalties

 if you sign a second book with us

 you wouldn't sign a second book with them you go to another publisher

 who says we'll pay you more royalties

 because you're so successful i would have written this book for free then

 i would have written

 this book for free in fact the first time i got off of a

 deal

 i said i said don't pay me an advance then give you royalties away

 why

 well because if

 what i'm saying all right fine i'll give my royalties away

 i'll shut my youtube channel

 down

 i'm saying we respond to incentives

 that if your publisher

 if penguin

 came to you

 and said book number two you get half royalties

 because you're in the top 1%

 would you sign with penguin or would you go someone el from a 2 million

 job a year

# Chapter 10

 i'll shut my youtube channel

 down

 i'm saying we respond to incentives

 that if your publisher

 if penguin

 came to you

 and said book number two you get half royalties

 because you're in the top 1%

 would you sign with penguin or would you go someone el from a 2 million

 job a year

 to run a youtube channel

 do you think i do the work that i do for money

 i'm not talking about that you do it for money

 i'm just saying

 if you had the option to

 sign

 between

 two

 publishing

 contracts

 right and all things being equal

 one's going to penalize you for being in the to 1%

 and the other one's going to reward you for being in the top 1%

 would you you of course you would go with the normal

 like if all things being equal you want to write a second book anyway

 it's the same for entrepreneurs

 when entrepreneurs start companies

 we can either start them in high tax economies

 or with a stroke of a pen start them in low tax

 i think the rich world is going to have to start rethinking

 the fact that it allows

 people to very very wealthy people to own

 enormous amounts of their physical wealth

 go live overseas and not pay tax i think that has to be revisited

 for sure

 because

 what you're saying is

 i want the benefit

 of being able to sell to the us market

 and the uk market

 but i don't want the obligation

 of having to pay us and uk taxes

 and you are correct

 that at the moment

 the us and uk governments allow that and i think that's

 us taxes you on worldwide income

 well only a small amount right so i think that realistically

 i think that the us and uk governments have to stop that but

 the way i see it the us and uk governments and increasing a lot of global

 governments

 are kind of being bought up by the elites

 and

 you know we have elo musk is basically

 the president

 right and we had richy sunak who father

 was one of the richest men in the world like if you're richy sunak

 who for our american viewers was our prime minister until very recently

 his father is one of the richest men in the world

 he's got 700 million

 personal wealth he's going to be making 3040 million pound passive income

 and you're getting paid 130

 grand de to be prime minister

 when you're making policy do you think maybe i'll ask my father-in-law at once

 you know the fact is what you're seeing here is if you allow the rich

 i'm i'm never ever against entrepreneurship

 i'm not against people getting rich

 if you allow the rich to get richer and richer and richer

 they squeeze

 the middle class and they squeeze the poor class out of things like housing

 of things like space in cities

 of things like energy

 and of things like owning

 a sharing government and media do you acknowledge that countries that adopt a anti-ri

 big government approach tend to collapse

 what like like this country in the

 60s

 we needed a us bailout we needed an imf bailout in 1976

 but the us did the same thing the us had even higher taxes than us

 we

 we

 basically

 like you take

 you take all the countries

 that where the government becomes big they meddle with your life they're involved in every decision

 right half the economy

 i mean here's one other the things

 this period

 is known

 as the golden

 age of capitalism

 it's the period of time when

 which period thisi 50 years off the second world war

 oh it's the golden age of middle class to be middle class

 you don't care about the middle class no no of course i do

 the the but the 70

 years after the world war ii

 yeah

 where the government

 sold

 off all of its houses to middle class

 people

 so we got housing

 wealth

 but you can only

 do that trick once

 right

 so you can only sell

 off all the houses

 to everyone

 once

 which is why all the baby boomers

 own them well

 the

 living s is collapsed

 after the houses were sold there was a long period where the houses weren't sold

 between the second world war and the 80s

 pinpo living standards collapsing

 well i think there's a few obviously

 big moments

 i think

 2008

 is a big moment i think co is a big moment

 i think it's the 80s

 where you start to see the wealth distribution

 go

 what matters is actually the distribution itself

 so once you change the tax system

 it takes a bit of time for the wealth distribution to change

 but once you start

 for me the big thing is is the loss of wealth holding

 i want ordinary

 families to be able to hold wealth

 and once you lose that

 you lose a middle class and you will not find me a single

 country

 in in the world now or the history of the world

 that has provided

 good broad living standards

 without allowing ordinary families to own assets

 yeah i agree and take singapore for example

 where everyone's encouraged to own properties they've got an amazing system in singapore

 they've taken this a massive government by the way enormous government 25% of gdp

 they they

 own they own the houses they have a weal f they own all the houses

 they don't own all the houses they have a

 a sovereign wealth fund that circulates

 houses through they've they own the hous they' solved they've solved

 singapore owns the house they own the singapore government owns an enormous share of the houses

 so do you think we should own pension pension funds people

 they force not force their citizens but they

 direct their citizens into home ownership

 you don't think singapore and government owns a large sh i just know that the singaporean

 government's only 25%

 of the economy

 but big sh of the housing stock 75

 the economy is i would like to say by the way just to be really clear

 i've never ever once advocated for big government

 never a single time

 big government i want higher taxes on the wealth orders

 so we can tax wealth creators

 and working people less

 i don't want to big a government i want our viewers to have more money

 i want our viewers to have more money and also

 i want to tax those super rich so that they stop squeezing

 ordinary

 families out of asset ownership

 it just

 yeah it see it it seems like an obvious solution

 it seems like

 yeah

 it's good solution

 it seems like

 like hey who's got the money rich people

 not the money the assets

 the asset who's got the assets

 rich people

 then let's just take them off them

 and

 no no no i don't want i don't want to redistribute

 i'm i'm i am the only person in this table anti- redistribution

 because the redistribution

 is happening in front of our eyes

 the middle class is losing its assets

 government is losing its assets

 those assets are being accumulated by the rich i want to stop the redistribution

 please

 please i'm i am the most anti- rist

 redistribution person in this game we need to stop the redistribu

 of wealth away from ordinary british and american families so

 the difference is for me it's very simple

 which is i really truly believe that free markets

 and low governments

 and less taxes

 creates more wealth in the middle and freedom for the heron is death for the fishes

 if we have complete freedom multi-millionaires

 like you and me will get richer and richer and richer every year

 and we will squeeze out and we will eat the middle class

 ask you though if wealth inequality could be solved but everyone does worse

 is that a good solu

 obviously

 not

 the whole reason i do this because i don't want ordinary

 people toap

 into public

 this is about people being able to feed their kids

 so wealth inequality

 is not the problem

 it's collapsing living stand that's quite contorted

 i mean quite contorted logic the problem isaps

 living standards i am somebody who has made millions of pounds

 by understanding the simple fact that living standards are falling because of growing wealth ine equality

 so living standards if they were to increase

 but they were super rich yeah is that a problem

 i think you do need to be worried about

 us

 extremely wealthy elites

 yeah i think what's interesting you look at the the founding of the united states

 these guys the founding of the united states conceptually

 is really based on these ideas of distribution of power

 that's why you have the president

 and the house and the senate

 and you have this independent

 judiciary

 they're like we cannot allow power to become concentrated

 because they came from a europe which had extremely

 concentrated

 power and extremely wealthy elites and extremely broad poverty

 so i think that allowing a small group of society to increasingly

 monopolize

 power and wealth over time is obviously something we should be worried about but primarily

 the reason i worry about wealth inequality

 is because i see

 and i bet on and i make money on

 the fact that it causes

 living standards

 to fall

 by the way i i actually really agree with you and the founding

 fathers

 of the us

 they did

 um especially around the 1900s

 they did want to break up monopolies

 and break up monopolies

 was one of the big things that

 um they did trust busting

 where they broke up standard

 oil and all of those sorts of things one thing i do really really

 see happening at the moment

 is that we have a stupid outdated definition of monopolies

 where we use monopolies the same way they used it when they had the oil

 companies that owned all the oil

 in the technology world a monopoly is formed through an ecosystem

 so amazon for example owning aws

 and audible and this and this and this and whole foods

 it creates

 a a fortress that's almost impossible to

 um to compete with and google owning youtube

 and gmail and all of this they create these fortresses through ecosystems

 one of the things that i do think we need to look at

 is

 compulsory

 breakup of big tech once you hit a certain time

 because

 it's very

 difficult

 because

 do you know

 billionaires

 have two big fears

 right keep them up at night having nightmares

 number two is high taxes

 number one is that startup entrepreneur who disrupts their business

 and they want to kill that early

 you know steve jobs at 24 years old disrupted

 ibm

 um and jeff bezos disrupted walmart so they are terrified of entrepreneurs in the middle

 um and they want to create government regulations

 to say hey you know what let's cap entrepreneurs

 at 10 million

 you can get to 10 million

 it's okay for us we're way past that point

 but gary's our guy because he's going to cap everyone

 i never said cap anyone at 10 million by the way

 what do you think will happen people stop

 as soon as you have wealth taxes

 people just give up they just don't want

 telling me our viewers

 if if they said

 if they knew they could build

 a 20 30 million

 ss ridiculous they knew they would have to pay 20

 if you if you're if you're worth 30 million 1%

 above

 is

 200 grand a year so if i said

 if you you can have a 30

 million pound company

 tr

 just bear in mind

 right you make 5%

 a year on your wealth

 right so if you got 300

 million pound company

 you're going to be making 15 million pound a year

 and i'm turning

 to you and i'm going to say you know you've got to pay

 200 grand

 a year on your 50

 million

 pound revenue

 and they're going to say you know what

 i'm not going to start a business

 i don't want to be worth 30 million quid

 this is

 you know this is ridiculous

 you know nobody

 is going to say

 oh my god i don't want to be multi multimillionaire

 because in 20 years time i'll have to pay 1% taxes but most traders

 most traders are earning what most people earn in lifetime traders can earn in a year

 most traders don't stop

 talk about that a lot in my book right so most traders just keep going entrepreneurs

 are the same

 that they're motivated to keep going but when you have wealth advisors and investors

 saying do not build a company in the uk because they're anti- wealth

 l

 i'm not trying to make the uk

 anti-

 wealth i'm not trying to make the uk

 and anti wealth

 i think

 the uk and the us need to be looking at a situation where you cannot allow

 people who own enormous businesses that sell to your country

 to live in dubai

 to live in the cayman islands and not pay tax

 and i i don't think that's a controversial

 position

 i've got a question for both of you which is if you are a young person

# Chapter 11

 wealth i'm not trying to make the uk

 and anti wealth

 i think

 the uk and the us need to be looking at a situation where you cannot allow

 people who own enormous businesses that sell to your country

 to live in dubai

 to live in the cayman islands and not pay tax

 and i i don't think that's a controversial

 position

 i've got a question for both of you which is if you are a young person

 and you're 18 years old now

 and that you're listening to this but your objective really is an individualistic

 one you want to get rich

 and you have a great future

 for you and your family

 like all all of us have been able to do

 what would your advice be to them gary at this moment in time

 this is such a hard

 question

 i know dan's angry at me for

 what i put in my video how to get rich

 um

 somebody

 came around to my house and asked me this other day obviously

 i get asked

 it a lot

 because

 stupidly i'm very public about the fact that i'm rich

 um

 what i did is not replicable

 what i did is not replicable

 it's not

 i'm sorry

 i'm sorry but it's not people always say why don't you teach me to trade

 like it's hard

 it's hard trading and it's dangerous

 and i think a lot of young men are getting sort of sold into trading

 and becoming gambling addicts

 um

 you know work hard and i would i wouldn't even say don't become an entrepr

 i've never ever said these things work hard

 you know if you think that you have an opportunity in tech entrepreneurship

 go for it understand it's risky

 i think that sometimes this message just become an entrepreneur

 and you make it is a bit dangerous

 because i think

 most people who try to become entrepreneurs

 fail

 and i think it's super super dangerous

 the reality is and you know maybe d like this maybe you won't like this

 i think it is very very difficult for a young man or a young woman

 from a poor family

 to become

 rich

 and i think it's increasingly hard even to just get those basics of financial security

 so

 listen obviously reduce your spending if you can don't buy into this like balenciaga

 stay away from that

 but

 work hard study hard try to get a good job but also understand

 we are shrinking the seats on the lifeboat that's what we're doing

 we used to allow

 50%

 to be secure then it's 40%

 then it's 30%

 then it's 20% you know you got family in nigeria

 if a young person from

 like shanty town in nigeria

 i came to you and said stephen what could i do to get

 rich

 you would have to say to him realistically listen

 you are in a difficult situation here

 you need to work really really hard but if you are able to make enough money

 to to support a family

 be proud of yourself

 what i would actually say to them so yeah i have got family in nigeria

 um for people that don't know i'm by blood half nigerian

 i would say to them that knowledge is really your life raft

 so

 obviously there's a

 big tech boom happening in nigeria

 which is liberating

 a lot of people from that situation

 so i would try and tell them to

 get on the life raft that is like knowledge of this new revolution

 so from nigeria you can learn to code and then

 the the great thing now is that we're we literally

 have actually this is quite interesting

 we're building a tech company in san francisco

 called flight cast it's live everyone can go look at at flight.com

 and

 the lead developer oh and guest radar

 the lead developer of guest radar is a nigerian guy but how many of those

 jobs in the nigerian tech sector

 are going to kids that grew up in the shanty towns i have no idea

 cuz i worked in

 people

 ask me tell me how to do what you did all right i worked in canary

 warf it's in east london

 i could see the building from my house going up

 there was not a single

 other kid from east london

 the whole time i was there

 do you know to dan's point about this remote work revolution where like work now has

 you can work from anywhere and in our company third web san francisco

 me some of the

 stuff that we now have are in the philippines

 because they just have like great creatives

 there it's obviously more cost

 effective

 isn't this a huge part of what's going on in our economy this this digitalization

 and this

 remotify b your workers in the philippines very very well

 um

 most of these people

 they used to have

 a half decent wage on office

 and now they're locked in their bedrooms barely paying the bills yeah um in the philippines

 not in the philippines the philippine guys are balling out control

 no i'm saying the philippines is booming at the moment

 so you think the average person in the philippines is living a luxurious

 life have you if you

 what's happening at the moment

 do you think the average

 person in the philippines is living a luxurious

 life there is there is this thing called remote foreign workers

 and

 this is a huge boom

 and

 the economic

 the kidchen move to the philippines

 then it's great you get great quality of life in the philippines

 you know when i looked at the thums of manila

 they should just get j they i don't know why they're not getting the laptops out

 the the poverty in the philippines is horrific

 i'm listen philippines a beautiful country an amazing country i love the philippines

 number

 in there at

 at a rate that's never

 what is the life

 like for your average

 filipino

 well would you agree though that their economy is just

 getting flooded with money at the moment like money is flowing in there

 money is flowing

 in but it is not giving a good quality of life your average filipino

 that's not true remote foreign workers

 well we can remote foreign workers filipino viewers to tell us what's

 can actually support the often support their en

 a look i don't know what the average

 wages in the phili

 just to bring it back to this point though so i wanted

 to know from gary

 he said work hard if you're a young guy listening to this now

 um i was reading this really interesting article yesterday

 from the i think it was from

 major

 newspaper

 talking about the lost boys

 and it goes to show that i think it's one in seven

 young men that is at a working age now are out of work

 so there's lots of talk around young men in particular

 and how they're struggling

 you'd say work hard gary

 you' say work hard no blena but the big thing

 the big thing is

 recognize the situation that you're in and i would encourage them

 to support my work and follow my channel because

 the lifeboats are shrinking and trust me

 we're going to get out kids in the lifeboats

 and we all know that all right and if those life boates are shrinking

 if you don't if you don't stop the from going down

 it is not you and you and me

 who are going to go down we will be fine

 if you don't fight the political fight i guarantee

 you

 people like daniel will so

 you're saying that they should also get involved in the political fight

 you have to you have to that's what our grandparents

 did

 grand if they want to become millionaires like you and me and dan

 well it sounds like dan's got better advice for that than i do

 okay well i'm going to ask dan as well but i just wondering

 i'm wondering how your your advice ties into sort of

 like

 the young the young person who's trying to liberate

 themselves from where you came from or where i came from

 you know what i don't think i'm the guy to say that man because you know

 i had this unusual

 gift from a young age i was very very very good at maths

 and i just followed

 that

 um and you know

 you know my sister she's a poet and she wrote a really successful

 grime of musical about diy r's first album

 all right

 she comes from obviously the same family as me poor family

 she works so hard she works so

 so hard

 two degrees

 she can barely pay the rent all right so

 i don't want to turn around to our young kids and say

 well i've got this talent follow your talent

 because it doesn't work stephen true it doesn't work yeah

 wait

 my sister does great work but financially

 for young people following your passion following your talent unless you come from rich family

 realistically

 very very

 really works and i know it worked for the three of us at this table

 but let's not pretend

 that everyone

 experiences the same things that we experienced

 what would you say to that d and what's your answer

 i think there's two economies going on at the moment there's a dying economy

 which is the industrial revolution

 economy

 um and that is all the office

 jobs and the factory

 jobs and all of that sort of stuff which is very much being automated

 away and moved

 globally

 um and at the same time there's this new bubbling up digital economy

 um which i'd call the entrepreneur economy or the digital economy

 um both of these economies are kind of co coexisting one's going like that one's going

 like that

 um

 and if you want to be economically

 successful you need to stand next to the biggest piles of money that you can

 um you know unfortunately being a poet

 doesn't pay a lot of money and we all know that that's not a surprise

 if you came from a very

 rich

 family

 and you were a poet

 you'd

 probably

 be one of the 60%

 who fell out of a rich family

 as well

 um

 if you want to be economically

 successful you need to say what is the thing that's economically booming right now

 gary

 saw

 the finance

 industry

 at that particular

 time but if we actually look at the finance

 industry

 now it's in decline

 um and trading is being rep replaced by ai robots

 um people who worked in your career are going to be replaced by

 it systems

 that basically

 do

 similar

 jobs it's going to be

 you know these things happen

 we're going through a massive

 technological change

 but at the same time it's never been easier

 to learn skills for free

 on youtube it's never been easier to join communities

 where you can get mentoring

 and get support

 there are communities of angel investors who do invest in in startups

 it's never been cheaper or easier to start a company

 there's never been more software and technology to scale and grow

 you know in just a in a short

 space of time i would say do what gary's

 done

 gary publishes

 online he's built a personal brand he's attached it to a recurring

 revenue model

 he's got yeah i also worked for three for free for four years

 i'm not sure how replicable

 that is

 you know

 so

 build a personal brand

 attach it to a business model that is that is where money is flowing

 um these are these are positive things you can do

 we all have to play the cards we're dealt

 you can always find someone who's done better

 with better cards

 or someone who's been dealt

 better cards and you can always find someone who's been dealt worse a cards

 no matter who you are on the planet there's someone better there's someone worse

 you have to play the cards that you dealt

 you cannot sit around waiting for the economic system of the world to be changed

 you have to say

 you know what

 these are the cards i was born at this particular time in this these circumstances

 these are my strengths these are my weaknesses

 i'm going to play the cards that i' i've dealt

 um personal agency is what gets people

 to feel good about their life to make progress

 and as soon as you play the victim mindset

 soon as you say

 oh you know what

 the answer to all my prayers is gary's going to change the system

 you're in serious trouble can i just say one thing back on that

 um if we become a society of of individuals

 who think only individually and and never consider broader societal problems

 we will become a society that becomes unable to fix societal

 problems

 i'm somebody who has made millions of pounds

 betting on the collapse of society the collapse of the middle class

 um i don't want to be giving stock tips on the titanic

 okay

# Chapter 12

 the answer to all my prayers is gary's going to change the system

 you're in serious trouble can i just say one thing back on that

 um if we become a society of of individuals

 who think only individually and and never consider broader societal problems

 we will become a society that becomes unable to fix societal

 problems

 i'm somebody who has made millions of pounds

 betting on the collapse of society the collapse of the middle class

 um i don't want to be giving stock tips on the titanic

 okay

 i i understand i understand that we live in individualized

 societies and and it's not popular to say hey you need to protect your society

 um

 if you don't protect your society your society is going to collapse

 and and the british public the american public have a choice to make here

 here to protect these what do you want people to do

 i want them to get involved

 with watch my channel

 subscribe to my channel

 content on youtube instagram tik tok share it with your friends share it with your mom

 understand

 and then push for change push for change like our grandparents did

 push the politicians

 to tax working people less and tax extremely

 wealthy wealth orders more so vote for the greens

 vote for whoever

 gives you that whoever gives you your share of the pip

 basic listen this is not football

 okay i'm not here

 m of the gre

 i'm here to protect the working class

 so that's their sort of that would be their social and sort of

 um political

 energy

 would be to stand up and fight

 but in their in their personal lives are you telling them to

 start businesses take big risks work really hard go for it because they can also

 i would defer to you guys on that you know i'm not a businessman

 i'm an economist

 that's what i am you know i made my money by being an economist

 i'm a very very good economist

 my predictions will be right people can go and watch my predictions

 at the beginning of covid

 i predicted the entire co crisis

 exactly correctly

 in may 2020

 you know this is you know i'm good at this i'm and listen

 i'm never going to come here and say i'm a better businessman

 than you and i don't

 i'm pretty sure that i'm not

 i'm a very very very good economist

 this will happen

 is there something

 that i can do if i'm sat here listening

 at home

 i

 understand everything you said i believe

 everything

 you said

 i i i believe that it's going to get worse for me

 do you think

 i should still take responsibility of my situation

 and fight to make my life

 richer better moreful

 100%

 100

 100%

 cuz you you know and i'm sure you know if you're average

 british or american if you don't do that

 you're not going to be able to turn the heating on

 you have to do it you have to do it and i've never once you

 i think my opinions

 are often mischaracterized

 to being anti- ambition

 you've read my book do you think i'm anti- ambition

 no

 i work my tits

 off to make money and i want every single

 young person

 in this country

 to be able

 to make money

 if they

 want to

 if that's what they want to work towards

 but we've created a society

 where it's almost impossible

 for young listen i've been there i've been at lc

 i've been at oxford

 i've been in the city i've been in the media i've been in politics

 all all of the guys at the top are a bunch of rich idiots

 we are not allowing

 these smart kids from ordinary backgrounds

 to get into those spaces

 why why do we pretend we're not doing that

 do that i disagree with that you're talking about two types of elite spaces

 elite space of elite universities

 yeah and you're talking about the elite space of derivatives trading

 there's the real economy

 yeah where entrepreneurs

 do their work

 then there's the first derivative which is the banking system

 and then there's the second derivative which is rates traders like yourself

 right these are these these are places that

 normal people don't want to end up most normal people who grow up in normal households

 don't

 wake up one day and say i want to be a rates trader

 on a double derivative of the economy making bets

 most people want to start a business that employs

 people and they want to grow that business and be successful

 do you think that

 starting a business

 is a realistic

 high success probability chance

 of ordinary poor people becoming rich i i know that economies thrive when entrepreneurs are active

 and it's not just the entrepreneurs

 they create

 is

 our viewers can do and most of them will end up rich you only need 1%

 to improve the whole economy there's a really interesting stat that says globally around 65%

 of ultra high net worth individuals are

 self-made

 approximately 19%

 primarily

 primarily inherited their wealth and about 16%

 inherited wealth but significantly grew it through their own ventures

 so 65%

 of the ultra high worth individuals globally

 are self-made

 does that not mean that if i want to become

 an ultra high networth person it's going to come down to

 listen

 we are just come off the back of the golden age of capitalism

 when ordinary

 people

 like my dad you know i grew up in ilford

 it's in east london it's a very immigrant

 area

 most of my friends i grew up with come from

 pakistani

 indian immigrant backgrounds

 they come over with nothing

 they worked really hard they made money they had their own assets we had a period

 where ordinary

 people

 could

 make money and could make wealth

 so obviously

 we are now in a period

 where

 there are rich people who made money during that period

 but it's over now i'm seeing ordinary people making money all the time

 okay so you're telling our viewers they're idiots why are they not making money

 i'm not telling anyone they're an idiot i'm saying that if it's that easy

 okay all right fine go and buy dan's book read it and become a millionaire

 because dan thinks it's easy

 to become a millionaire

 being an entrepreneur

 but i suspect having not been an entrepreneur

 that most of the people who've read your book are not millionaires

 everything you've touched has turned to gold

 you turned yourself to academia

 you got

 an amazing

 qualification

 you turned yourself to banking

 you became 2 million a year

 you turned yourself to being a writer

 you become sunday

 times bestseller

 you turn yourself to content creating you get 800,000

 followers

 and you and now you sit there after all of that evidence

 and say oh no it's all over guys it's all

 i'm smart

 enough to do it but you guys are not smart enough to do

 if if you think you can teach

 you've got your book

 if you think you canach you say

 you're smart enough but they're not smart enough

 i i wonder if um we do have a bit of an education problem

 at the at the heart of this because i was thinking about your sister

 and i was like right if i was the ceo

 of gary's

 sister

 what would i do

 there's two things i do right now the first is okay where's where what what marketplace

 is really valuing

 an ability

 to write

 and write an impactful

 way i go write you need to start an instagram

 page

 because

 i've seen what happened

 with j sh

 this guy's

 pulling

 in tens of millions

 a year

 because he took like you

 know

 nice words that were motivational

 poetic put them on there and i also youtube

 needs to get to youtube

 because

 if she can talk like you

 then she's going to do exceptionally well on youtube as well

 um but the old

 there's not going to be a great economy necessarily

 for someone who's doing poetry

 in many other places other than one i'm saying is the internet

 but in school we don't teach this there's no youtube class for youtube

 and and it's such a huge part of the economy i mean

 i mean me and you have seen that it's there's been this decentralization

 of media where the megaphone was growing at 20% a year the me

 the megaphone was people watching start a youtube become ent

 it's the internet isn't

 e i'm not say

 works for most people stepen for most people no it doesn't work

 it doesn't work

 why are we pretending

 it does

 but i what what i what i would say

 is if in school

 we taught young kids a couple

 new things and we stopped teaching them about pythagoras's

 theorem

 which by the way chat gbt

 is going to do for you with your eyes closed

 and we taught them

 about the new economy of the internet

 about the ability to start a shop

 and i

 it's crazy that

 i

 the school system was designed in such a way where they put me in exclusion

 unit because i was so preoccupied

 with doing

 business deals at school

 and my headmaster

 came on t

 national tv on what i lied to and said

 yeah we unexp

 beled him eventually

 because he made the school so much money but the system

 was punishing

 me

 for entre for entrepreneurship

 and it wasn't teaching me anything about the the new economy which is which is technology

 st do you think it matters if the percentage

 of young people who are able to

 achieve financial freedom

 and have a family is shrinking

 so do i think it matters if the percentage of young people that are able

 to

 are you saying

 attain wealth and have a family yeah achieve financial freedom and have a family

 i think that's a really big problem listen

 i think that's a really big problem

 i agree i know listen and i know you've got this podcast

 and i know you inspire

 young people and i think that's a good thing

 i think it's a good thing that you inspire

 young people

 to go out

 and work hard and try and achieve

 something

 but i'm an economist

 and what i see is the percentage of young people who make it shrinking

 and i think if you combine those two things you reach a really dangerous place

 because we go and tell the young people

 it's there for you to start a business

 and at the same time

 the number of people who make it is 10%

 5% 2%

 1%

 and

 there will always

 be that one person who makes

 it

 there will always be that steven

 bartley

 in every country in the world who's making it through

 you know what i'm saying but

 the systematic

 issue matters stephen

 c can we can we not change the education

 system so that when i was

 16

 and they threw me in the exclusion

 unit

 which made me which would could so easily

 have made me think

 that i was a failure

 because my brothers who went jason went to lsc

 okay and became very much like you and now works in my company

 um managing my investments

 he in that education system was rewarded so i sat there as a kid thinking

 rich and successful

 my older brother jason

 because he can do maths

 and i thought i'm going to be a failure

 because i like this thing called entrepreneurship

 and i have adhd

 so i can't pay attention in lessons

 what i'm saying is if the education

 system was designed in such a way where people like me who were entrepreneurial

 who were interested in the internet and couldn't stop playing video games

 were clapped for and said oh my god double down on that

 yeah um i think

 the net benefit

 when you think about what the backbone of the economy is which is entrepreneurs

 starting businesses

 would be profound

 for this country here

 yeah but that

 but but i i think that i believe

 there

 needs to be such a radical

 overhaul

 of our education

 system if we want to stand a chance of capitalizing

 on what the economy is today

 yeah i i think

 i think you could probably

 change

 the education

 system in a lot of ways that could improve

 it but you're kind of changing

 the education

 system

 on the titanic

 what my my perspective

 is i can tell you with a very very high rate of certainty

 if you don't fix this problem of the wealth being sucked out of the middle class

 95

 98%

 of people will be in poverty in this country in 70 years i agree with you

 this is the thing

 i agree

 that you can't

 have a group of people at the very top that own all the assets

 and all the money or else i mean it's going to come from somewhere

 and i remember the day that i printed off the jobseekers

 allowance

 form

 when i was stealing chicago

 town

 piz

 10 years ago in my room in mosside

 in manchester

 i remember what it feels

 like

 to not have my parents speaking to me

 to be

 have all these ccj

 letters and baith letters on my desk

 and really

 have no answer

 how how to get out of the situation to the point that i was like shoplifting

 i'd call the justy

 driver and then trying to persuade him just to give me the food

 that was that was that was 10 years ago for me so i i it's not

 i've not forgotten

 the the those years of my life

 so i understand what it is

 to be in that

 situation

 and on an individual level i need need some answers

 because i'm not going to wait for these people in

 the parliament to fix my life for me so i need some individual answers

 and then i do also care about the bigger picture so i'm not like here

 as someone that just wants to

 acrew loads of wealth myself of course listen let's be honest

 no one like

 there's not many human beings that wouldn't like more money

 so i try and acknowledge that bias

# Chapter 13

 situation

 and on an individual level i need need some answers

 because i'm not going to wait for these people in

 the parliament to fix my life for me so i need some individual answers

 and then i do also care about the bigger picture so i'm not like here

 as someone that just wants to

 acrew loads of wealth myself of course listen let's be honest

 no one like

 there's not many human beings that wouldn't like more money

 so i try and acknowledge that bias

 but what i'm the the the the big issue i have is

 is is how

 and from my personal experience

 as someone that now employs

 hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people here in london

 up in manchester in our offices

 i there are a set of things that would make me leave this country

 if it became increasingly

 less

 friendly to entrepreneurs i reckon if we come back here in 5 years time

 i reckon i'll employ

 500 more

 people in the uk

 and actually

 as you look around

 this room you can see the age of them these are young

 people

 yeah

 um

 there are things you could do to make me not do that

 i mean it's probably worth pointing out that we're not taxing

 wealth and you're leaving the country anyway stephen no i haven't left the country

 okay you're going

 i'm i'm a tax resident

 here i pay my taxes

 here and i have zero

 intent in changing

 that

 i'm also on dragon

 you know so we're investing

 a lot of money in uk

 businesses

 but listen

 i want to raise i want to tax only

 high levels of wealth only high levels of wealth

 and listen don't get me wrong i understand very rich people will complain

 and very rich people will say just like they did in dickens

 i'm going to throw my businesses

 i'm going to throw my taxes

 my

 my businesses and my factories into the sea

 stephen your viewers are here

 you listen steven your viewers are here you are a very wealthy person

 they are are paying 20 30 40 50%

 you should be paying your fair share stephen you should

 i think that i should

 pay more tax especially when

 um

 i don't think my kids should get

 should should benefit

 from my wealth

 and maybe this is a controversial

 opinion but i actually don't

 i don't think i should be able to pass down my assets to my children

 you can't it's 40% tax i think it should be more 4 yeah

 let's not pretend rich people don't successfully

 pass their ass their children i'm just telling you now

 i do

 think i'd be robbing

 my children of something

 from the background

 that i came from if my ch my child

 gets

 if my child

 has gets tens of millions

 let's say even

 when i die i don't think that should happen

 well i agree

 people say

 when i talk about

 my sister

 people like why don't you just give your sister

 a load of money

 listen

 my sister works hard

 she's a smart person she works hard

 she produces

 good work

 i want to live in a society

 where people like my sister

 are able to support

 themselves with the work that they do but we we're destroying that society

 who would pay her

 the the customers you know this the situ so you want her to start a business

 she is a business

 yeah

 yeah and i want people like her to be to be taxed

 less

 so that

 what i want is

 ordinary

 working

 people

 to be tax

 less so they have more money in their pocket listen

 the reason we had the thriving

 art scene in the 60s

 is because we had a thriving middle class

 that could go and buy the new fashions

 and buy the new records and then that created

 this thriving art scene

 now we have a middle class which is struggling to pay the bills so they can't

 they can't buy stuff they you know

 my syst makes theater shows

 the only people who go to the theater

 are rich people now but back back in the day you know theater

 was something that was more accessible

 you want you want the arts

 i've got to mate use a fashion designer right

 nowadays

 there's all of the business is

 super fast super cheap super disposable fashion

 or unbelievably

 expensive high-end

 because that's the economy we've created

 i want you go to japan which is a less unequal society

 the restaurants are good quality restaurants for ordinary people because

 a good capitalist society will produce things for the people with money

 in the case of theater

 where have the theater consumers moved to where are they getting their entertainment now

 well

 what you have is a very rich

 group of people who will still go to the theater

 and they will pay a lot but then you have

 a large group of people who are relatively

 cash scarce

 and they will try to get their entertainment

 in cheaper ways of course you know what i mean

 they're spending their time watching your youtube channel well exactly my you

 which is free by the way yeah but you get paid from it

 you get the youtube

 honest it's only in the last couple of months

 that i started

 to make any money

 because i don't do my own

 um editing

 so

 and you i mean you'll know

 but in the first few

 years you're paying

 yourself

 to

 do it you know what i mean

 like i think people

 some

 times

 massively overestimate

 the amount of money this is entrepreneurs

 entrepreneurs

 go through 2 three four

 5 years worth of struggle

 to get to the point where they're

 successful

 and it feels pretty horrific

 that you say oh finally when i make it you take it

 um and then the advisers to entrepreneurs just 10 million is quite a lot of money

 so you know you can be worth 9 million

 and not be paying anything more but what if i just raise 1 million for investment

 into my company

 but that then

 like i do if i'm if if i'm raising money all the way along

 and my investors are saying i'm sorry i don't invest in the uk economy

 because it's wealth taxes and all that sort of stuff it's anti- wealth

 and then i just have to move my company overseas

 well i want to create a situation where the uk consumer is so strong

 that you have to invest

 in the uk

 you don't have to be here to sell to

 them

 if you're looking to take the next step in your tech career

 you'll want to hear about our sponsor inuit

 quick one i want to talk to you about our sponsor whoop

 a business i'm also an investor in

 and if you follow me on instagram you probably noticed that recently i've picked up running

 which i'm very much enjoying and it started out as a challenge

 but it's now evolved into something i do almost

 daily it is one of those things that's pushing me to be better every single day

 but here's the thing to me progress isn't just about pushing harder it's also about training

 in a smarter

 way

 which is where my whoop

 comes in

 whoop doesn't just track my workouts

 it tells me how ready my body is to take them on

 before i've even started the workout

 a few years ago we ran a study called project

 p are and it found that runners who adjusted their training based on their recovery

 scores

 improved their 5k times by an average of 2 minutes

 and 40 seconds while reducing injury risk by over 30%

 and they did it while training less

 so if you're looking for this type of guidance when it comes to your training

 head over to join.

 woop.com ceo and get a 30-day trial with zero commitment that's join.

 woop.com

 ceo

 let me know how you get on

 so so do we all agree on this premise

 though that gary's

 saying which is the very

 the ultra

 rich

 which we can classify

 as being

 worth more than you're saying

 we say 10 10 million is the line that we campaign

 for

 okay

 we

 we think that they should pay a greater share of the tax

 and then the qu if you agree with that premise the question then becomes

 yes but how yeah

 well they already do 1% pay 30%

 i want to be clear

 that's the top 1% of taxpayers

 which is not the top 1% of richest people mind you i'm also not necessarily saying

 um what's fair i'm saying what's practically

 possible right so like you could you could come up with the world's most fair

 on a back of a napkin this is what's fair

 but whether you can implement it is a very difficult thing

 the problem is wealth is completely

 mobile

 now it's really you can live work from

 anywhere

 the houses

 dan yeah it's land

 is that mobile you going rip you can't rip the country out of the

 out of the sea there's very few i've never met any

 seriously wealthy people who own a lot of houses

 you honestly think that the entire housing stock of the uk is not valuable

 yeah no it is but

 78% is owned by baby boomers they just own they've they've bought a house in 1992

 they own the house personally i think that that house ownership especially when you consider mortgages

 is relatively unequally distributed

 that is by the way the most equally distribut

 young people have now had the commercial

 property

 the land the natural

 by pension funds

 so

 you're the viewers own it do they

 no they're owned by if they own a pension

 fun

 most of those commercial

 what the distribution of pion

 what is the distribution of pensions what percentage of pensions is owned by top 1%

 the

 i wouldn't know off the top of my head but with pensions

 but i know i know that ob

 obviously

 wealth concentrates

 at the top but here's the one thing keep in mind wealthy group are not necessarily

 a static group

 there was a study

 of

 the richest people

 in

 1900

 and most of those families are poor today

 or they they've gone down in value today

 if the richest people in 1900

 had have just simply kept their wealth there'd be 16,000

 more billionaires

 but but they they don't

 um you know in wealth management in banks yeah they have this thing called the

 um succession planning

 so succession

 planning

 is where they try and figure

 out how to not to screw

 it up across

 generations

 and they're they're notoriously

 bad at it it's very hard to keep wealth in generations down in the 20th

 century

 we had two world wars and a

 holocaust that redistributed

 wealth

 i would prefer not to have that again yeah yeah yeah

 i'm with you i want a affluent

 middle class

 i i really

 do

 so where's

 the we

 going to come from

 you want

 to

 just

 you're going

 to create

 your

 entrepreneurs

 entrepreneur

 entrepreneur

 economies that are friendly towards wealth creation and entrepreneurship

 was the last time you had a government that wasn't let's grow let's grow let's

 grow

 it's not working

 for the people

 daniel

 no the problem is is that they need to step

 back they need to let shrink

 let shrink

 let

 shrink

 our viewers should keep

 close

 ey on donald trump and elon musk

 because they're doing what you're asking

 it'll be interesting to see what happens

 right

 it's too soon to tell if you were trying to grow the uk economy

 would you not take america

 approach because they seem to be much more successful at growing growing their economy

 i think

 i mean of course

 when we talk about slashing

 of the state they're going to use these examples

 like oh there's this wasteful

 government building

 everybody

 wants to slash

 government

 waste

 of course i'm not going to fight against slashing

 government

 waste

 um

 i'm from the uk

 you know i saw the austerity years

 i've seen what's happened to local services

 i've seen what's happened to things like the police like like education

# Chapter 14

 government

 waste

 of course i'm not going to fight against slashing

 government

 waste

 um

 i'm from the uk

 you know i saw the austerity years

 i've seen what's happened to local services

 i've seen what's happened to things like the police like like education

 you know especially things like youth services

 um you slash the state you fire a load of people you know

 what does the state okay yeah if you can get rid of state corruption yes 100%

 if you can get rid of state waste 100% you know

 this is how single moms feed their kids

 stephen

 you want to stop that

 no i'm saying that

 slashing the state

 i don't think it's going to work

 um to be honest i think tariffs is is not an uninteresting

 discussion i think yeah of course tax avoidance is something you need to get rid of

 really

 i would like to take a step back look at the country and say

 what is the state of the country

 what what the people need

 you know we have a country

 here where the housing stock is falling

 apart

 and we're letting it fall apart

 because

 those houses

 are owned by ordinary people who don't have any money

 if you want the country to work for ordinary people

 you need ordinary people to have money i'm always reminded of mr beast

 he goes to places in africa

 and he spends

 500

 quid

 and he gives a kid eyesight

 who would have been blind for the rest of their life

 for 500 quid

 why are kids in africa blind who could be given sight for 500 quid

 because they don't

 have

 any money

 this is what happens when you drain your middle class

 you

 this will end up like that you know you know

 i've got a friend who

 went to india

 last week

 he said there were people lying on the street outside with rotting limbs

 you know that is what happens when you when you disempower

 when you take the money away from your middle class

 you've got to protect the middle class

 if the middle class had

 money

 then there would be unbelievable

 business opportunities for selling

 goods and services like your business to the middle class so would you tax daniel more

 i don't know if daniel's worth more than 10 million pounds it sounds like he is

 um is

 i mean i think

 i want to make it clear right

 you people you make

 5%

 on your wealth

 so if daniel's

 worth 100 million

 he's making £5 million

 we're only trying to tax you 1%

 i think if you are worth 100 million

 you're making 5 million pound passive income

 you can afford to pay

 a million pound tax a year you're going to still keep getting rich

 the truth

 is

 even if we were to tax these billionaires

 1% a year they would still squeeze the rest out this is not

 this is not about morality

 this is just cold

 hard economic analysis that i have made a lot of money betting on so closing arguments

 then chaps

 um i'll start with you gary based on everything we've discussed today

 um what is

 i'm going to ask you to to give me two perspectives which is

 if i'm a young individual in this country right now

 what should i do to protect myself and my family and to feed my family

 what kind of behaviors

 what strategy should i drop

 there

 but also then from a

 government level i know we have some politicians that listen because they message me

 what should

 politicians

 be doing to to fix

 the issue that we're all clearly identify

 which is the collaps of the middle class the collaps of sort of working-class

 people and the the

 the increased wealth of the rich

 i think

 what i would like young people to understand is that

 this gets worse this getss much much worse it will get much worse

 um relatively quickly poverty will increase relatively quickly it will become increasingly

 difficult almost impossible to make any serious money

 prepare yourself for that prepare yourself when you consider your finances

 when you consider your plans for having a family

 um

 this

 gets

 worse

 and it's going to be really

 really hard

 it's going to be

 a big mental

 health

 problem

 for a lot of young

 people

 um so speak to people and understand that

 um my youtube videos are there g's economics people don't understand what's happening

 um

 after that

 you've got to do all the right things

 yeah i mean i don't disagree

 with you

 you've got to work hard you've got to study the right things

 um i i think it's a great shame we have made subjects like the arts

 um a thing which

 you you're not allowed

 if you come from po poor backgrounds

 you cannot work in arts

 i'm sorry

 you can't pay the bills you can't

 so you have to go and study

 ai and computing

 and you know maybe social media although we have to be honest social media doesn't

 pay for most

 people

 um

 you have to realize the reality of your situation it's very very very

 very bad

 that doesn't mean you don't work that doesn't mean you don't aspire

 you work damn hard because you have to

 but if you manage

 to make enough

 money to even

 support

 a family

 you should be proud of yourself

 that that's the number one thing

 um but

 recognize

 this can be changed this can be changed our grandparents our great-grandparents

 fought

 for our biggest share of the pie and they got it

 they got healthcare

 they got education

 they got housing they got food

 our young people can have that as well

 but they won't get it unless they fight for it so i would encourage people

 to

 educate themselves support my work get involved politically but also work hard

 support your friends and family try and make money because you'll have to

 if you don't play politics

 i guarantee you the other side will play politics and that means

 your kids and your grandkids live in poverty so you have to do both

 with regards to politicians

 um i got mixed feelings about a lot of politicians

 the truth is i think a lot of politicians are very rich and and ultimately

 they don't care they're protected

 a crisis of inequality

 looks fantastic

 from the top

 and i think that's why the three of us can sit here and say

 things will be fine

 because for us they will be fine

 and for our kids they will be fine

 but for our viewers

 kids they won't be fine

 um the politicians are not going to try and save you

 i'm going to try and make sure they do it but i don't think they will

 listen

 my plan

 is not to get concessions from politicians

 my plan is to get 5 million followers on the internet and bully the politicians

 so that they have to give us what we need so i would support people

 to get behind me get behind my campaign but also

 understand what's happening educate your friends and your family and just crucially to understand

 this is going to be a long fight so be strong

 keep your people around you

 but be ready for what's to come

 i am i see hint and some of the things you've said recently of you

 going into politics yourself at some point

 stephen i'm in politics

 but i me politics actively

 listen i i do not want to be an mp

 i do not want to be chancellor

 i do not want to be prime

 minister

 if we get to a point where i feel that that is something that is achieved

 when is the best way to

 fix this problem

 i will be open to it this is not plan a this is not

 you know

 would you like to be prime minister i suspect probably not right like this is

 i'll be honest i i

 am quite uncomfortable with even the level of um public profile

 that i have at the moment

 which is you know it's much less than what you have but it stresses

 me out and

 it's weird we spoke about it before we were shooting

 um

 i don't want to can you imagine

 i i don't want to be prime minister i don't want to be an mp

 um

 but i'm serious about this work that i do

 and if we reach a point that i think

 that is the best way to do it

 i will consider it but i would much rather

 be able to influence the mps

 from the sideline to influence the politicians from the sidelines

 and for that person you just gave advice to who should they be voting for

 well we don't have an election for listen

 politics is not football

 politics is not football

 okay this is not about i'm labor i'm conservative

 i'm republican

 i'm democrat

 you're losing your houses

 here

 you you're losing your houses

 your kids will be in poverty

 and you're going to see

 both trump and the republicans

 and karma

 and labor

 who are supposed to be on the opposite side of the political spectrum

 they will both fail

 because they will not take action on growing wealth inequality

 and

 i'll

 be

 right

 on

 that

 you

 know

 bring

 me

 back

 in a few

 years

 i'll

 be

 right

 on

 that

 and

 um that shows you it's not about i think this factionalism

 is unbelievable

 damaging to our societies

 especially in the us where there's so much hatred behind it where suddenly

 i'm on this side you're on that side

 we're going to shake hands after this

 nothing

 we will you know it's there's no hatred

 here

 but if you allow yourself to be divided

 from half of your country

 and you allow we're seeing it growing

 tensions

 racial tensions gender tensions

 if you allow yourself to be divided

 they will win they will win so you need to vote for

 whoever is going to protect your houses

 and if you want to know who that is

 come and check gary's

 economics

 before the election

 and i will tell you who it's going to be

 daniel nice closing arguments personal and social a a few things

 um i read gary's bookin it's brilliant and regardless of

 um

 regardless of whether you actually

 like economics

 it's a brilliant story it's a really i read it in about two or three days

 um and it'll it'll eventually be a good movie as well

 um i agree with a lot of what gary's saying

 um there is a collapse of the middle class and it probably will get worse

 and

 the traditional

 middle class jobs

 that came out of the back of the industrial

 age

 mature

 industrial

 revolution

 system

 th those are collapsing and it's globalizing we're seeing technology move opportunities all over the world

 um and wealth inequality it has a cause

 wealth inequality itself is a scoreboard

 and there's a cause for what led up to wealth inequality

 and the cause in my mind is technology

 technology is moving the those opportunities around and it's changing things

 we already have big governments

 we have huge amounts of taxes we're at record levels of tax taes

 um

 wealth has never been more mobile

 it's not about what's fair it's about what you can practically

 get away with it's about what you can

 actually

 implement

 um and

 it's going to be very very

 as gary said it's going to be very very very hard

 to tax people who have digital

 businesses

 who can live and work from anywhere i know that firsthand

 um that it's incredibly

 mobile

 with that said at a micro level oh sorry at a macro level big picture

 we do know that there is a correlation

 between economic freedom

 where the government gets out of your way

 and low poverty rates

 and we know that as soon as governments become big

 high taxes high regulations

 it actually drops down

 a category and we see poverty goes up from 10% to 30% so triples

 um so

 constricting economic freedom is never a good idea if you look at the data

 at a micro level there's never been a greater opportunity

 for anyone who's ambitious and entrepreneurial

 to go and start a company

 it's cheaper than ever to start a company

 you can do what gary's done which is publish content

 build a following

 figure out how to monetize it

 you can create products and services and sell them to anywhere in the world

 um you're an example of someone who started with nothing and became a millionaire

 in your 20s

 and then again in your 30s with a completely

 different thing

 he became a millionaire

 in his 20s

 and then again in his 30s is's a bestselling

 author and a content creator

 i did it in my 20s my 30s and now my 40s

# Chapter 15

 you can create products and services and sell them to anywhere in the world

 um you're an example of someone who started with nothing and became a millionaire

 in your 20s

 and then again in your 30s with a completely

 different thing

 he became a millionaire

 in his 20s

 and then again in his 30s is's a bestselling

 author and a content creator

 i did it in my 20s my 30s and now my 40s

 um starting from scratch

 so

 it's it's not normal that three guys

 our agage could have done that over and over again

 it's because we are living in a time where there is incredible

 opportunities

 but you have to be tapped into those opportunities

 you never heard about it at school you never heard about it at university

 you're going to have to learn the skills

 to get tapped into those opp opportunities

 but there are definitely

 ways that you can succeed

 in the world that we're living in

 and on that macro point who should we be voting for because some of your

 thinking in policy

 suggestions

 through this conversation align more with trump elon

 the american mission now where they're welcoming millionaires

 they're trying to create a really entrepreneurship

 friendly environment

 they're doing the doge dismantling

 of sort of government waste

 i i agree with gary it's not football you don't have a team you swing

 you should be a swing voter

 you should vote

 every single election

 you should make them work hard for your vote

 and you should is trump going to succeed

 though you should see it's too soon to tell

 but he made a prediction

 so i'm inviting you to make a prediction

 he said five years time we come back here we're going to see that trump

 i think

 i think a lot of

 very

 wealthy

 people are going to move

 move to the usa

 um you're going to get a lot of people from all over the world he's playing

 to win

 and he wants

 rich people and entrepreneurs

 and investors

 to come into the us and be based there he's creating golden visas and open visas

 and the success metric here is the middle class get richer and more affluent

 what i actually

 think will happen as a result of all of that you will see rising living standards

 in the usa

 and you'll see a detriment

 to the places where those people live

 it's not a good thing

 to have the people who pay the majority of the taxes which is 1%

 of people paying 30% of taxes

 if those people leave

 the bills

 get spread across everybody else

 well we'll have to do a part two and we shall see

 um

 i want to thank you both

 for the work that you do

 because

 i'm a big fan of both of you

 i watch gary's

 videos all the time helps me to

 understand another perspective

 on what i'm typically hearing out out on the internet

 or that i hear on twitter about what's going on in the world

 and i think i really

 respect

 and admire

 people that can do what both of you have done today

 which is to exchange and listen to ideas in the pursuit of answers

 and that's why i'd highly recommend anybody

 regardless of whether you agree with everything or some things or

 or or just a little bit

 to go and follow gary's channel on youtube called gary's economics

 because it's a great source of

 information

 from someone who has done it from understands the world from another perspective but also

 someone who's providing a narrative

 which i actually think there's we kind of talked about before you started

 there's a big gap in the market for

 there are a lot of people

 like me and dan out on the internet that are talking about entrepreneurship

 and finance and how to make money

 but there aren't enough people talking about wealth inequality from the perspective as gary sees

 um and that are providing more sort of

 collectivist and sort of society

 wide

 solutions and answers and sort of explanations as to why that's ultimately happening

 i do think

 i do think because i know you dan i hope i know myself

 i do think that we we all want

 the uk to survive

 and i think we all believe that the way that the uk survives

 isn't necessarily a couple of ultra rich people getting more money

 it is

 sort of social mobility and it's allowing people that are at the very bottom

 to create opportunities and to succeed we all agree upon that even if we agree

 disagree sorry on the causes and the solutions to that

 um

 i'd also highly recommend

 everybody to go check out the trading

 game because everybody's

 talking about this this book and

 i think it's what four weeks at the moment on the sunday

 times

 besteller

 list

 four weeks number one number one

 four weeks number one

 which is

 an incredible

 achievement

 but it speaks to what's in this book the way that the story is told

 but also

 the timeliness

 of this message

 so i'd highly recommend

 everybody to go check it out i'm going to put a link below

 so that everybody

 can go and do it and if you just look at some of the

 um

 the the testimonials

 for this book it's

 profound i hear people describe it as like

 unforgettable

 on one end and then sad

 on the other end because that's the

 nature of the reality

 it speaks to and i highly recommend everybody to go check out

 dan priestley's

 entreprene

 revolution

 but also

 your website has all of your resources

 and tools on it so i'll link that on the screen what's the

 danel priest.com danel priest.com thank you both for your generosity

 really really appreciate it thanks for bringing us together

 no matter where in the world it seems like everyone
