# Chapter 1

the following is a conversation with leonard susskind he's a professor of theoretical physics at stanford university

 and founding director of stanford institute of theoretical physics he's

 widely regarded as one of the fathers of string theory

 and in general is one of the greatest physicists of our time both as a researcher

 and an educator this is the artificial intelligence podcast perhaps

 you noticed that the people have been speaking with are not just computer scientists

 but philosophers mathematicians writers psychologists physicists

 and soon other disciplines to me ai is much bigger than deep learning bigger

 than computing it is our civilizations journey into understanding

 the human mind and creating echoes of it in the machine

 now here's my conversation with leonard susskind

 you work two more friends with richard fineman house he influenced you changed

 you as a physicist

 and thinker

 what

 i saw i think what i saw was

 somebody who could do physics in this deeply intuitive way his

 style was almost a closed his eyes and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about

 and through visualization

 i'll flank the mathematical highly mathematical and very very sophisticated technical

 arguments that people would use i think that was also natural to me but i saw

 somebody who was actually successful at it who

 could do physics in a way that that i regarded as

 simpler more direct more intuitive

 and while

 i don't think he changed my way of thinking i do think he validated it he

 made me look at it and say yeah that's something you

 can do and get away with practically

 even get away with it

 so do you find yourself whether you're thinking about quantum mechanics

 or black holes or string theory using intuition as a first step

 or step throughout using visualization

 yeah very much so very much so i tend

 not to think about the equations i tend not to think about the symbols i tend to try

 to visualize the phenomena themselves

 and then

 when i get an insight that i think is valid i might

 try to convert it to mathematics

 but i'm not a math and then a natural mathematician

 or i'm good enough at it i'm

 good enough at it but i'm not a great mathematician

 so for me the way of thinking about physics is first intuitive first

 visualization

 scribble a few equations maybe

 but then try to convert it to mathematics

 experiences that other people are better at converting into mathematics

 and i am

 and yet you've worked very counterintuitive ideas

 so

 how that's true that's naive is something connor into every their

 rewiring your brain in new ways

 yeah

 quantum mechanics is not intuitive very little of modern physics is intuitive intuitive

 or what does intuitive mean it

 means the ability to think about it with basic classical physics the physics that that

 we evolved with throwing stones

 splashing water or whatever it happens to be quantum

 physics general relativity quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way but you know after time

 and getting familiar with these things you develop new intuitions

 i always said you rewire

 and

 it's to the point

 where me

 and many of my friends find many my friends

 can think more easily quantum-mechanically

 than we can classically we've gotten so used to it i mean

 yes our neural wiring in our brain is such that we understand rocks

 and stones and water and

 so i'm sort of evolved evolved

 for you do you think it's

 possible to create a wiring of neuron

 like state devices that more naturally understand

 quantum mechanics understand wave function understand these weird things

 well i'm

 not sure i think many of us have evolved

 the ability to think quantum mechanically to some extent

 but that doesn't mean you can think like an electron

 that doesn't mean an another example forget

 for a minute quantum mechanics just

 visualizing four dimensional space or five dimensional space or six dimensional space i think we're fundamentally

 wired to visualize three dimensions i can't even visualize two dimensions

 or one dimension without thinking

 about it as embedded in three dimension in space if

 i want to visualize a line i think of the line as being aligned

 in three dimensions right well

 i think of the line as being aligned

 on a piece of paper with a piece of paper being in three dimensions i never

 seem to be able to in some abstract

 and pure way

 visualize in my head the one dimension

 the two dimension the four dimensions

 the five dimensions and i don't think that's ever gonna happen

 the reason is i think our neural wiring is just set up for that on

 the other hand we do learn ways to think about five

 six seven dimensions and we learn ways we learn mathematical

 ways and we learn ways to visualize them

 but they're different and

 so

 yeah i think i think we

 do rewire ourselves whether we can ever completely rewire

 ourselves to be completely comfortable with these concepts i doubt

 so

 that it's completely natural there was a tour it's completely natural so i'm sure there's some

 what you could argue creatures that live in it two-dimensional

 space

 yeah

 and there are

 and

 um well it's romanticizing

 the notion of course we're all living as far as we know in three-dimensional space but how

 do you how do those creatures imagine 3d

 space well probably the way we imagined 4d by using some mathematics

 and some equations

 and some some tricks

 okay

 so jumping back to a fireman just for a second

 he had a little bit of an ego

 yes

 what do you think ego is powerful

 or dangerous in science i think

 both both both i

 think you have to have both arrogance

 and humility you

 have to have the arrogance to say i can

 do this nature is difficult nature

 is very very hard i'm smart enough i can do it i can win

 the battle with nature on the

 other hand i think you also have to have the humility to know that

 you're very likely to be wrong on any given occasion everything you're thinking could suddenly change

 young people can come along and say things you won't understand

 and you'll be lost

 and flabbergasted

 so

 i think it's a combination of both you better recognize that

 you're very limited and you better be

 able to say to yourself

 i'm not so limited

 that i can't win this battle with nature it

 takes a special kind of person who can

 manage both of those i would say and i would say there's echoes of that in

 your own work a little bit of ego a little bit of outside

 of the box humble thinking i hope

 so

 so it was their time

 where you

 complete you felt you looked at yourself and asked am i completely wrong about this

 oh yeah

 but the whole thing about specific things the whole thing that way which cold thing me

 and me

 and my ability to do this thing

 oh those

 kinds of doubts those first of all did you have those kinds of doubts no

 i had different kind of doubts i came from a very working-class background

 and i was uncomfortable in academia for

 oh for a long time

 but they weren't doubts about my ability of my

 they were just the discomfort

 and being in an environment that

 my family hadn't participated in

 i know nothing about as a young person

 i didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics

 until i was almost 20 years old

 so i

 did have certain

 kind of doubts but not about my ability i don't

 think i was too worried about whether i would succeed or not i

 never

 i never felt this insecurity am i ever gonna get a job that

 veteran never occurred to me that i wouldn't

 maybe you could speak a little bit to this sense of what is academia for

 because i do feel a bit uncomfortable in it mm-hm

 there's

 something i can't put quite into words what you have that's not doesn't

 if we call it music you

 play a different kind of music than a lot of academia

 what

 how have you joined this orchestra

 how

 do you think about it i don't

 know that i thought about it as much as i just felt it yeah

 you know thinking is one thing feeling is another thing i felt like an outsider

 until a certain age when i suddenly found myself the ultimate insider in academic physics

 and

 that

 was a sharp transition in the world i wasn't the young man i was probably

 50 years old you were never quite it

 was a phase transition you were never quite free milk in the middle yeah

 that's right i wasn't i always

 felt a little bit of an outsider the beginning a lot

 and outside earth

 my way of thinking was different my approach to mathematics was different

 but also

 this my social background that i came from was different

 now these days half the young people i meet their parents were professors my

 that was not my case

 so

 yeah

 but then all of a sudden at

 some point i found myself at they're very much the center of maybe

 not the only one at the center

 but certainly one of the people in the center of a certain kind of physics

 and all that put away i mean i went away in a flash

 so

 maybe maybe a little bit with fineman

 but in general

 how

 do you develop ideas do

 you work their ideas alone do you brainstorm with others oh both

 both very definitely both

 the earth the younger time i spent more time with myself

 now

 because i'm at stanford because i'm

 because i

 have a lot of ex students

 and i you know people who who are interested in the same thing i am i

 spend a good deal of time almost on a daily basis interacting

 brainstorming as you said it's

 a it's a very important part i spend

 less time probably completely self focused

 and

 the paper and just sitting there staring at it

 what are your hopes for quantum computers

 so

 machines that are based on that have some elements of leverage quantum mechanical ideas

 yeah it's not just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas

 you can simulate quantum

 systems on a classical computer simulate

 them means solve the schrodinger equation for them or solve the equations of quantum

 mechanics on a computer

 on a classical computer but the classical computer is not doing is not

 a quantum mechanical system itself of course it is that everything is made of quantum mechanics

 but it's not some functioning it's not a functioning as a quantum system it's

 just solving equations the quantum computer is truly a quantum system

 which is actually doing the things that you're

 programming it to do you

 want to program a quantum field theory

 if you

 do it in classical physics that program is not actually

 functioning in the computer as a quantum field theory it's just solving some equations

 physically

 it's not doing the things that that

 the quantum system would do the quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system

 which is actually carrying out the quantum operations you can measure it at the end it

 intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle it is limited

 in the same way that quantum systems are limited by uncertainty

 and so forth and it really is a quantum system that means that

 what you what you're doing when you program something

 for quantum system is they're actually building a real

 version of the system

 the limits of a classical computer classical computers are enormous ly limited when it comes to

 the quantum systems enormously limited

 because you

 probably heard this before but

 in order to store the amount of information that's in a quantum state of

 400 spins

 that's not very many 400 i can put in my path with 400

 pennies in my pocket

 so we'll be able to simulate

 the quantum state of 400

 elementary quantum systems qubits

 we call him to

 do that would take more information

 than can possibly be stored in the entire universe if it were packed

 so tightly that

 you

 couldn't pack anymore in right 400

 cubits on the other hand if your

 quantum computer is composed of four hundred qubits

 it can do everything four hundred qubits can do

 what kind of space

# Chapter 2

 the quantum systems enormously limited

 because you

 probably heard this before but

 in order to store the amount of information that's in a quantum state of

 400 spins

 that's not very many 400 i can put in my path with 400

 pennies in my pocket

 so we'll be able to simulate

 the quantum state of 400

 elementary quantum systems qubits

 we call him to

 do that would take more information

 than can possibly be stored in the entire universe if it were packed

 so tightly that

 you

 couldn't pack anymore in right 400

 cubits on the other hand if your

 quantum computer is composed of four hundred qubits

 it can do everything four hundred qubits can do

 what kind of space

 if you just intuitively

 think about the space of algorithms that

 that unlocks for us so

 there's a whole complexity theory around classical computers measuring

 the running time of things and pe

 so on what

 kind of algorithm is just intuitively do you think it's you

 know mocks for us okay

 so we know that there are a handful of algorithms

 that can seriously be quantum of classical computers

 and which can have exponentially

 more power and this is a mathematical statement nobody's exhibited this in the laboratory it's

 a mathematical statement we know that's true

 but it also seems more

 and more that the number of such things is very limited only very very special

 problems

 exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer

 others of standard problems to

 my mind as far as i can tell the great power of quantum computers will actually

 be to simulate quantum systems if you're

 interested in a certain quantum system

 and it's too hard to simulate classically

 you

 simply build a version of the same system

 you build a version of it you build a model of it that's actually functioning

 as the system you

 run it and then

 you do the same thing you would do the quantum system you

 make measurements on it quantum

 measurements on it the advantages you can run it much slower you

 could say why bother why not just use the real system and

 why not just do experiments on the real system well

 real systems are kind of limited you can't change them you can't like them

 you can't slow them down so that you can poke into them you

 can't modify them an arbitrary kinds of ways to see what would happen if i if

 i change the system a little bit

 so i think that quantum computers

 will be extremely valuable in

 in understanding

 quantum systems at the lowest of the fundamental laws they're

 actually satisfying the same laws as the systems that they're simulating that's right okay

 so in the one hand you have things like factoring in factoring is the great

 thing of quantum computers factoring large numbers that

 doesn't seem that much to do with quantum mechanics right

 it seems to be almost a fluke

 that a quantum computer can solve the factoring problem in a short time

 so though

 and those problems seem to be extremely special rare

 and it's

 not clear to me that there's gonna be a lot of them on

 the other hand there are a lot of quantum systems chemistry there's solid-state

 physics there's material science there's quantum gravity there's all kinds of quantum of quantum field theory

 and some of these are actually turning out to be applied sciences as well as very fundamental sciences

 so we

 probably will run out of the ability to solve equations for these things you

 know solve equations by the standard methods of pencil

 and paper and solve the equations by the method of classical computers

 and

 so

 what we'll do is we'll build versions of these systems

 run them and run

 them under controlled circumstances or

 we can change them manipulate them make

 measurements on them and find out all the things we want to know

 so in finding out the things we want to know about

 very small systems right

 now the is there something we can also find out about the macro level about

 something about it the function

 and forgive me of our brain

 biological systems the the stuff that's about one meter in size versus much much smaller well

 what the only excitement is about among the people that i interact with is understanding

 black holes that falls black holes are big things

 there are many many degrees of freedom there is another kind of quantum system that is big it's

 a large quantum computer

 and one of the things we learned is that the physics of large quantum

 computers is in some ways similar to the physics of large quantum

 black holes and we're using that relationship

 now you asked you didn't ask about quantum computers

 or systems you didn't ask about black holes you asked about brains

 yeah i bought stuff that's in the middle of the - it's different

 so

 but black holes are there's

 something fundamental about black holes it feels to be very different in the brain

 yes

 and they also function in a very quantum mechanical way right

 okay

 it is first of all unclear to me but of course it's unclear to me i another

 i'm not a a neuroscientist i have

 i don't even have very many friends who are neuroscientists i would

 like to have more friends who are neuroscientists

 i just don't run into them very often

 among the few neuroscientists

 i've ever talked about about this they are pretty convinced that the brain functions classically

 there is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system

 or doesn't

 make use of the of the special features entanglement coherent

 superposition are they right i don't know i sort of hope that wrong with just because i like

 the romantic idea that the brain is a quantum system

 and

 but i think that i think probably not

 the other thing big systems can be composed of lots of little systems

 materials the materials are that we work with and so forth are

 three large systems

 and a large piece of material but they're bagan they're made out of quantum systems

 now one of the things that's been happening over the last a good number of years is with

 discovering materials

 and quantum systems

 which function

 much more quantum mechanically then

 than we imagine topological insulators this kind of thing that kind of thing those are macroscopic systems

 but they just superconductors

 superconductors i have

 a lot of quantum mechanics in them you

 can have a large chunk of superconductor

 so it's a big decent material on the other hand it's functioning

 and its properties depend very very strongly on quantum mechanics and to

 analyze them you need the tools of quantum mechanics

 if we can go on to black holes mm-hmm

 and looking at the universe as a information processing system as a computer as a giant computer

 what's the power of thinking of the universe as an information processing system

 but what is perhaps its use besides the mathematical use of discussing black holes

 and your famous debates

 and ideas around that to

 human beings

 or life in general as information processing systems well all systems are information processing systems

 you poke them they change a little bit they evolve all systems

 or information processes there's no extra magic to us humans it

 certainly feels consciousness intelligence feels like magic sure though where does it emerge from

 if we look at information processing

 what are the emergent phenomena that come from viewing the world is an information processing system here

 is what i think my thoughts are not worth much of this if you ask me about physics

 my thoughts may be worth something

 yes if you ask me about this i'm not sure my thoughts are worth anything

 but as i said earlier i think when we do introspection when we imagine doing introspection

 and try to figure out what it is when we do and we're thinking i think

 we i think we get it wrong i'm

 pretty sure we get it wrong everything i've heard about the way the brain functions is

 so counterintuitive

 for example you have neurons

 which detect the vertical lines you have different neurons

 which detect lines at 45 degrees you have different neurons i never

 imagined that there were whole circuits

 which were devoted to vertical lines in the brain yeah

 doesn't seem to we where when my brain works my

 brain seems to work put my finger up vertically

 or if i put it horizontally or

 if i put it this way or that way it

 seems to me it's the same the same circuits that are it's not the way it works

 the way the brain is compartmentalized

 seems to be very very different than

 what i would have imagined if i were just doing

 psychological introspection

 about how things work my conclusion is that we won't get it right that way but

 how

 will we get it right i think maybe computer scientists

 will get it right eventually i

 don't think that any ways near it i don't even think they're thinking about it

 but by computer eventually we will build machines perhaps

 which are complicated enough

 and partly engineered partly evolved maybe evolved by machine learning

 and so forth this machine learning is very interesting by machine learning will evolve systems

 and we may start to discover mechanisms that

 that have implications for

 how we think and for what what does consciousness thing is all about and

 we'll be able to do experiments on them and perhaps answer questions

 that we can't possibly answer by by introspection

 so that's a really interesting point you've in many cases

 if you look even at string theory when

 you first think about a system it seems really complicated like the human brain and through

 some basic reasoning then

 trying to discover a fundamental low-level

 behavior of the system you find out that it's actually much simpler you one have

 you you know is that generally the process and to do you have that also hope for biological

 systems as well for all

 the kinds of stuff we're studying at the human

 level of course physics always begins by trying to find the simplest version of something an analyzer

 yeah

 i mean there are lots of examples where physics has taken

 very complicated systems analyze them and found simplicity in them for sure i said superconductors

 before it's an obvious one a superconductor seems like monstrously complicated

 thing with all sorts of crazy electrical properties magnetic properties

 and so forth and when

 it finally is boiled down through its simplest

 elements it's a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon called spontaneous symmetry breaking and

 which we in other context we learned about and we're very familiar with so

 yeah i mean

 yes we do take complicated things make them simple

 but

 what we don't want to do is take things which are intrinsically complicated

 and fool ourselves into thinking that we can make them simple we

 don't want to make i

 don't know who said this but we don't want to make them simpler

 than they really are right

 okay is the brain a thing

 which ultimately functions by some simple rules

 or is it just complicated in terms of artificial intelligence

 nobody really knows

 what are the limits of our current approaches you mentioned machine learning

 how do we create human level intelligence it

 seems that there's a lot of very smart physicists who perhaps oversimplify

 the nature of intelligence

 and think of it as information processing

 and therefore

 that it doesn't seem to be any theoretical reason why we can't artificially create a human

 level or super human level intelligence in fact the reasoning goes if you create human level intelligence

 the same approach you just used to create human level intelligence should

 allow you to create superhuman

 level intelligence very easily exponentially

 so

 what do you think that way of thinking that

 comes from physicists is all

 about i wish i knew but there's a particular reason why i wish i knew

 i have a second job i consult

 for google ah not for google for google x i am

 the senior academic advisor third to

 a group of machine learning physicists at

 now that sounds crazy because

 i know nothing about the subject i know

 very little about the subject on the other hand i'm good at giving advice so

 i give them advice on things anyway i see these young physicists

 who are approaching the machine learning problem

 there is a myth there is a real machine learning

 problem mainly why does it work as well as it does it

 nobody really seems to understand why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations

 that it does and so forth

 and

 there are three groups of people who have thought

 about this there are the engineers the engineers are incredibly smart

 but they tend not to think as hard about why the thing is working

 as much as they do how to use it obviously they

 provided a lot of data and it is they who demonstrated that machine learning

 can work much better than you have any right to expect the machine learning

 systems are systems that the system is not too different

 than the kind of systems if this is a study there's

 not all that much difference between quantum

 construction of mathematics physically

 yes but in the structure the mathematics between a tension

 network designed to describe a quantum

 system on the one hand and the kind of networks that are used in machine learning

 so

 they're more

 and more i think young

 physicists are being drawn to this field of machine learning some very very good ones i work

 with a number of very good ones not on machine learning but having lunch on having lunch

 yeah

 and i can tell you they are super smart they don't seem to be

 so

 arrogant about their physics backgrounds

 that they think they can do things that nobody else can do

 but those physics way of thinking i think will add will

 i had great value to um will

 bring value to the machine learning i believe it will and i think it already has

 and

 what time scale do you think predicting the future becomes useless in your long experience

 and being surprised at new discoveries

 sometimes a day sometimes 20 years there are things

# Chapter 3

 yes but in the structure the mathematics between a tension

 network designed to describe a quantum

 system on the one hand and the kind of networks that are used in machine learning

 so

 they're more

 and more i think young

 physicists are being drawn to this field of machine learning some very very good ones i work

 with a number of very good ones not on machine learning but having lunch on having lunch

 yeah

 and i can tell you they are super smart they don't seem to be

 so

 arrogant about their physics backgrounds

 that they think they can do things that nobody else can do

 but those physics way of thinking i think will add will

 i had great value to um will

 bring value to the machine learning i believe it will and i think it already has

 and

 what time scale do you think predicting the future becomes useless in your long experience

 and being surprised at new discoveries

 sometimes a day sometimes 20 years there are things

 which i thought

 we were very far from understanding

 which

 practically in a snap of the fingers

 or a blink of the eye suddenly

 became understood completely surprising for me

 there are other things which i looked at and i said we're

 not gonna understand these things for 500 years in particular quantum

 gravity the scale for that was 20 years 25 years and

 we understand a lot and we don't understand it completely now

 by any means but we're i thought

 it was 500 years to

 make any progress it

 turned out to be very very far

 from that it turned out to be more like 20 or 25 years from

 the time when i thought it was 500 years

 so for me can we jump around quantum gravity some basic ideas in physics

 what is the dream of string theory mathematically

 what is the hope where does it come from what

 problems are trying to solve i don't

 think the dream of string theory is any different

 than the dream of fundamental

 theoretical physics altogether understanding

 a unified theory of everything i

 i don't like thinking of string theory as a subject unto itself with

 people called string theorists who are the practitioners of this thing called string theory i much

 prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists

 trying to answer deep fundamental questions about nature in particular gravity in particular gravity

 and it's connection with quantum mechanics

 and who at the present time find string theory a useful tool rather

 than saying there's a subject

 called string theorists i don't like being referred to as a string theorists

 yes but as a tool is it useful to think about our

 nature in multiple dimensions the strings vibrating i believe it is useful

 i'll tell you what the main use of it has been up till now well

 has had a number of main uses originally

 string theory was invented then i know there i was there i was right

 at the spot where it was being invented

 literally

 and it was being invented to understand

 hey groans hey drones are sub-nuclear particles protons neutrons mesons

 and

 at

 that time the late 60s early seventies it

 was clear from experiment that these particles call hydrants had could vibrate could rotate could

 do all the things that a little closed

 string can do and

 it was

 and is a valid

 and correct theory of these hydrants it's been experimentally tested

 and that is a done deal it had

 a second life as a theory of gravity the same basic

 mathematics except on a very very much smaller distance scale

 the objects of gravitation are nineteen

 orders of magnitude smaller than a proton but

 the same mathematics turned up the same mathematics turned up what

 has been its value its value is that

 it's mathematically rigorous in many ways and enabled us to to

 find to find mathematical structures

 which have both quantum mechanics

 and gravity with rigor we

 can test out ideas we

 can test out ideas we can't test them in the laboratory that

 nineteen orders of magnitude too small

 or things that were interested in but we can test them out mathematically

 and analyze their internal consistency by

 now

 forty years ago thirty five years ago so forth people

 very very much questioned the consistency between gravity

 and quantum mechanics stephen hawking was very famous for it rightly

 so

 now nobody questions that consistency anymore they don't because we have mathematically precise string theories

 which contain both gravity

 and quantum mechanics in a consistent way

 so it's provided that

 um that certainty that quantum mechanics

 and gravity can coexist that's

 not a small thing that's

 a very huge thing it's a huge thing einstein be proud einstein

 he might be appalled i don't know i'm like a very much yeah

 he would certainly be struck by it yeah i think

 that maybe at this time its biggest contribution to physics in illustrating almost definitively that quantum mechanics

 and gravity are very closely related and not inconsistent

 with each other is there a possibility of something deeper more profound that still is

 consistent with string theory but is deeper

 that is to be found well

 you could ask the same theme of quantum mechanics is there something exactly yeah

 yeah i think string theory is just an example of a quantum mechanical system that

 contains both gravitation

 and in quantum mechanics

 so is there something underlying quantum mechanics perhaps something deterministic

 so have something deterministic my

 friend far out it wolf whose name you may know he's a very famous physicist dutch

 not as famous as he should be but the heart

 dispels names it's hard to say his name you know it's easy to spelling ' he's only person

 i know his name begins with an apostrophe

 and he's one of my heroes in physics

 and it's a little younger than me but it's nonetheless one of my heroes the tufte believes

 that there was some sub

 structure to the world

 which is classical in character the deterministic in character

 which somehow by some mechanism that he has a hard time spelling out emerges

 as quantum mechanics i

 don't the wavefunction is somehow emergent the wavefunction

 and not just the wavefunction

 but the whole making the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics uncertainty

 and pango

 meant all these things are emergent do

 you think quantum mechanics is the bottom of the well as is the right

 here i think is here

 i think is where you have to be humble here's

 where humility comes i don't think anybody should say anything

 is the bottom of the well at this time

 yes i think we i think we can reasonably say i

 can

 reasonably say when i look into the well i can't

 see past quantum mechanics i don't

 see any reason for it to be anything beyond quantum mechanics i

 think a tuft is a sperry interesting

 and deep questions i don't like his answers well

 again let me ask if we look at the deepest nature of reality with whether it's deterministic

 or

 unobserved is probabilistic

 what

 does that mean for our human

 level of ideas of free will is there any connection whatsoever from

 this perception perhaps illusion of free will that we have and the fundamental

 nature of reality the only thing i can say is i am i am

 puzzled by that as much as you are the illusion of it the illusion of consciousness

 the illusion of free will the illusion of self

 does that connect to

 how can a physical system do that and

 and i am as puzzled as anybody there's echoes of it in the observer effect

 yeah

 so do you understand

 what it means to be an observer i understand

 it at a technical

 level an observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom that it can record information and

 which can become entangled with the thing that's measuring entanglement is the key when a system

 which we call an apparatus

 or an observer same thing

 interacts with the system that it's observing it

 doesn't just look at it it becomes physically entangled with it and it's that entanglement

 which we call an observation

 or measure

 now does that satisfy me personally as an observer hmm

 yes

 and no i find it very satisfying that we have a mathematical representation of

 what it means to observe a system

 you are observing stuff right now

 yeah the conscious level right is you think there's echoes of that

 kind of entanglement in our macro scale yes absolutely for sure we're

 entangled with quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room if we weren't of

 and it was just well we wouldn't be observing it

 but on the other hand you can ask though i really am

 i really comfortable with it and i'm uncomfortable with it in the same way that

 i can never get comfortable with five dimensions

 my my brain isn't wired for it are you comfortable with four dimensions a little

 bit more because i can always imagine the fourth dimension this time so

 the arrow of time are you comfortable with that arrow do

 you think time is an emergent phenomena

 or is it's fundamental to nature

 that is a big question in physics right now all the physics that we do or

 at least that the people that i am comfortable with talking to my

 my friends

 yeah my friends no

 we all ask the same question that you just asked in space

 we have a pretty good idea is emergent

 and it emerges out of tan tangle mint and other other things time

 always seems to be built into our equations as just

 what newton pretty much were for newton

 modified a little bit by einstein would have called time

 and

 and mostly in our equations it is not emergent

 time in physics is completely symmetric forward

 and bathymetric

 so you

 don't really need to think about the area of time for most physical phenomena the most microscopic phenomena

 no it's

 only when the phenomena involves systems

 which are big enough for thermal

 amyx to become important the entropy to become important for small

 subsets a small system entropy is not a good concept

 an entropy is something

 which which emerges out of large numbers it's a probabilistic idea it's a statistical idea

 and it's a thermodynamic idea thermodynamics requires lots

 and lots and lots of little sub structures

 okay

 so it's not until you emerge

 at the thermodynamic level that there's an arrow of time do we understand it

 yeah

 i think i think we understand better than most people think that most

 people say they think we understand it yeah i think we understand it it's

 just a statistical idea the you mean like second law thermodynamics entropy

 and

 so on yeah the pack of cards

 and you're flinging it in the air and you look

 what happens to it yeah

 but what's random we understand it doesn't go from random to

 simple it goes from simple to random

 but do you think it ever breaks down

 what i think you can do is in a laboratory setting you can take a system

 which is somewhere intermediate between being small

 and being large

 and make it go backward a thing

 which looks like it only

 wants to go forward because of statistical mechanical reasons because of the second law you

 can very very carefully manipulate it to make it run backward i don't

 think you can take an egg humpty dumpty who fell on the floor yeah

 and reverse that

 but you can in a very controlled situation you can take systems

 which appear to be evolving

 statistically toward randomness stop

 them reverse them and make them go back what's

 the intuition behind that

 how do how do we do that how do we reverse it a clue

 you're saying closed system

 yeah pretty much closed system

 yes did you just say that time travel is possible no

 i didn't say time travel is possible i said

 you can make a system go backward in time

 and you

 don't like it go back you can make it reverse it steps

 you can make it reverse its trajectory

 yeah

 how do we do what's the intuition there does it have is it just a fluke thing

 that we can do at a small scale in the lab that doesn't have what

 i'm saying is you can do it on a little

 bit better than a small scale you

 can certainly do it with

 a simple small system small

 systems don't have any sense of the arrow of time atoms atoms

 no

 sense of the arrow of time they're completely reversible it's

 only when you have you know the second law of thermodynamics is the law of large numbers say

 you can break the law because it's

 not you can break german

 isn't the break it but it's hard it

 requires great care the bigger

 the system is the more to care the more the harder it is you

 have to overcome what's called chaos

 and that's hard and it

 requires more and more precision

 for 10 particles you

 might be able to do it with a with

 some effort 400 particles it's really hard for a thousand

 or a million particles forget it but not for any fundamental

 reason just because it's technologically too hard to

 make the system go backward

 so

 so note no time travel for engineering reasons

 oh no

 no no what is time travel time travel time

 travel to the future that's easy

 yes you just close your eyes go to sleep and you wake up in the future yeah

 yeah good nap gets you there yeah good map gets you there right

 but in reversing the second law of thermal

 is a very difficult engineering effort i wouldn't call that time travel

 because it gets to me too mixed up with what the science fiction calls time-travel

 right this is just the ability to reverse a system

 you take the system

 and you reverse

 the direction of motion of every molecule in it that

 input you can do it with one molecule

 if you

 find a particle moving in a certain direction let's

 not say a mama particle a baseball you

# Chapter 4

 reason just because it's technologically too hard to

 make the system go backward

 so

 so note no time travel for engineering reasons

 oh no

 no no what is time travel time travel time

 travel to the future that's easy

 yes you just close your eyes go to sleep and you wake up in the future yeah

 yeah good nap gets you there yeah good map gets you there right

 but in reversing the second law of thermal

 is a very difficult engineering effort i wouldn't call that time travel

 because it gets to me too mixed up with what the science fiction calls time-travel

 right this is just the ability to reverse a system

 you take the system

 and you reverse

 the direction of motion of every molecule in it that

 input you can do it with one molecule

 if you

 find a particle moving in a certain direction let's

 not say a mama particle a baseball you

 stop it dead and then you simply reverse its motion in principle that's not too hard

 and it'll go back along its trajectory in

 the backward direction just running the program backwards running the program backward

 yeah okay

 if you have two baseball's colliding well you can do it but you

 have to be very very careful to get it just right

 now ten baseball's really really tore better yet tend

 ten billiard balls on an idealized frictionless billiard table mm-hmm

 okay

 so you start the balls all in a triangle right

 and you're whack them yep depending on the game you're playing you the wacom

 where you're really careful but the you're welcome

 and they go flying off in all possible directions

 okay try to reverse that

 try to reverse that imagine

 trying to take every billiard ball stopping

 it dated sometime at some point

 and reversing its motion

 so it was going in the opposite direction if you did that with tremendous

 care it would reassemble

 itself back into the triangle

 okay that is a fact

 and you can

 probably do it with two billiard balls maybe with three billion balls if you're really lucky

 but

 what happens is as the system gets more and more complicated you have to be more

 and more precise not to make the tiniest error because the tiniest errors will get magnified

 and you'll simply not be able to do the reversal

 so

 yeah you could that

 but i wouldn't call that time travel

 yeah that's something else

 but

 if you think think of it it

 just made me think if we think the unrolling of state that's happening as a program if

 we

 look at the world so the idea of looking

 at the world as a simulation as a computer

 but it's not a computer it's just a single program a question arises that might be useful how

 how hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe

 okay

 so

 there are mathematical

 universes that

 we know about one of them is called anti de sitter space

 where we

 and it's quantum mechanics well i think we could simulate it in a computer

 and a quantum computer classical

 computer all you can do is solve its equations

 you can't make it work like the real system if

 we could build a quantum computer or big enough one robust

 enough one we could probably

 simulate a universe a small version of an anti-de sitter universe

 and that the sitter is a kind of cosmology

 so

 i think we know how to do that the

 trouble is the universe that we live in is not the anti-de sitter geometry it's the decent

 or geometry and we don't really understand the quantum mechanics at all so

 at the present time i would say we wouldn't have the vaguest

 idea how to simulate a universe

 similar to our own you

 know we could ask oh we could we build in the laboratory a small version a

 quantum mechanical version the collection of quantum computers entangled

 and the couple together which

 would reproduce the the phenomena that go on in the universe even on a small scale

 yes

 if you were anti de sitter space know

 if it's the sitter space can you a slightly describe the sitter space and anti-de sitter space

 yeah

 what are the geometric properties of big

 different they differ by a this is the sine of a single constant

 called the cosmological constant

 one of them is negatively curved the other is positively curved the anti-de sitter space

 which is the negatively curved one you

 can think of as an isolated

 system in a box with reflecting walls you

 could think of it as a system of quantum mechanical system isolated in an isolated environment the

 sitter space is the one we really live in and that's the one that's exponentially expanding

 exponential expansion dark energy whatever you want to call it and we don't understand that mathematically

 do

 we understand not everybody would agree with me but i don't understand

 they would agree with me they definitely would agree with me that i don't understand it

 what about their an understanding of the birth the origin no the bing bang so knows

 what normally theories there are theories

 my favorite is the one called eternal inflation the infinity

 can be on both sides

 on one of the sides and none of the sides so what my real opinion

 okay

 infinity on both sides

 oh

 boy

 yeah

 yeah that's why is that your favorite because it's the the most just

 mind-blowing no

 because we want a beginning no why do we want a beginning i

 practiced it was the beginning of course and practice it was a beginning

 but could it have been a

 random fluctuation in an otherwise infinite time maybe in any case the the eternal inflation theory

 i think if correctly understood it would be infinite in both directions

 how do you think about infinity

 oh god

 so

 okay of course you can think about mathematically

 i just finished this i just finished this discussion with my friend sergey brin yes

 how do you think about infinity i say well sergey brin is infinitely rich

 how do you test that hypothesis

 okay

 essential good lines all right

 yeah

 so there's no there's really no way to visualize some of these things like ya

 know this is a very good question those physics have any is

 does infinity have any place in physics right right

 and well i can say is very good question

 so

 what do you think of the recent first

 image of a black hole visualized from the event horizon telescope it

 it's an incredible triumph of science in itself the fact that there are black holes

 which collide is not a surprise

 and they seem to work exactly

 the way they're supposed to work will

 we learn a great deal from it i don't know i can i i we

 might but the kind of things we learn won't really be about black holes

 why there are black holes in nature of that particular mass scale

 and why they're so common may

 tell us something about the structure evolution of structure in the universe

 but i don't think it's going to tell us anything new about black holes

 but it's a triumph in the sense that you

 go back a hundred years and it was a continuous development general

 relativity the discovery of black holes ligo

 the incredible technology that went into ligo

 it is something that

 i never would have believed was gonna happen you know 30 40 years ago and

 i think it's a magnificent the structure magnificent thing

 this evolution of general relativity

 ligo high precision ability to measure things on a scale of 10 to the minus 21

 so

 so you're just astonishing

 though we zoom all this just happy for us to this right

 picture is it different you know

 you've thought a lot about black holes is it how did you visualize them in your mind

 and is the picture different than you know lies that no it simply confirmed

 you know it's a magnificent triumph to have confirmed confirmed a direct observation

 yeah that einstein's theory of gravity at the level of black hole collisions actually works is awesome

 and it's really awesome you

 know i know some of the people who were involved in that they

 just thought married people

 yeah

 and the idea that they could carry this out i

 just don't i'm shocked yeah just

 these little homo sapiens

 yeah just these little monkeys got together right

 and took a picture of slightly advanced lemurs i think

 what kind of questions can science not currently answer

 but you hope might be able to soon well you you've already addressed them what is consciousness

 for example do you think that's within the reach of science i think it's somewhat

 within the reach of science but i think that

 now i think it's in the hands of the computer scientists

 and the neuroscientists

 i'm not a physicist perhaps with the helper haps at some point

 but i think physicists will try to simplify

 it down to something that they can use their methods

 and maybe they're not appropriate maybe we

 maybe we simply need to do

 more machine learning on bigger scales evolve machines machines

 not only that learn but volve their own architecture

 as a process of learning evolve in architecture

 not under our control only partially

 under our control but under the control of a machine learning

 i'll tell you another thing that i find awesome

 you know this google thing that they taught the computers

 how to play chess yeah

 yeah

 okay they taught the computers

 how to play chess not by teaching them how to play chess

 but just having them play against each other against

 each other itself against each other this is a form of evolution these

 machines evolved they evolved

 and intelligence

 they evolved in intelligence without anybody telling them how to do it

 and we're not engineered they just played against each other and got better and better and better

 that makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence

 what

 exact kind of intelligence i don't know but in understanding that

 better and better maybe we'll get better clues as to what there goes on your

 life and intelligence is last question

 what kind of questions can science not currently answer

 and may never be able to answer yeah

 is there an intelligence

 out there that's underlies the whole thing you

 can call them with the g word if you want i

 can say are we a computer simulation with a purpose

 is there an agent an intelligent agent that underlies

 or is responsible

 for the whole thing does

 that intelligent agent satisfy

 the laws of physics does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics is it made of atoms

 and molecules yeah there's a lot of questions

 and i

 don't see this it seems to me a real question it's

 an answerable question well it's answerable the questions have to be answerable to be real

 some philosophers would say that a question is not a question unless it's answerable

 this question doesn't seem to me answerable by any known method

 but it seems to me real

 there's no better place to end monitor thank you so much for talking about okay

 you
