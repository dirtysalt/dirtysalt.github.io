# Chapter 1

- What happened during World War II was

that once the Germans started to run out

of manpower, they created foreign legion groups.

But because those people were not

Aryans, they couldn't be trusted.

So they were put under the command

of Heinrich Himmler under command of SS,

and became known as SS Waffen units,

and one of such units was created in Ukraine.

- The following is a conversation with Serhii Plokhy,

a historian at Harvard University

and the director of the Ukrainian Research Institute,

also at Harvard.

As a historian,

he specializes in the history of Eastern Europe

with an emphasis on Ukraine.

He wrote a lot of great books on Ukraine

and Russia, the Soviet Union, on Slavic peoples in general,

across centuries on Chernobyl and nuclear disasters,

and on the current war in Ukraine,

a book titled The Russo-Ukrainian War,

The Return of History.

This is the Led Fridman podcast, to support it,

please check out our sponsors in the description.

And now, dear friends, here's Serhii Plokhy.

What are the major explanations

for the collapse of the Soviet Union?

Maybe ones you agree with and ones you disagree with?

- Very often people confuse three different processes

that were taken place in the late eighties

and early nineties, and the one was the collapse

of communism as ideology.

Another was the end of the Cold War,

and the third one was the end of the Soviet Union.

All of this processes were interrelated, interconnected,

but when people provide ideology as the explanation for all

of these processes, that's why I disagree,

because ideological collapse happened on the territory

of the Soviet Union in general.

Soviet Union lost the Cold War, whether

we are talking about Moscow, Leningrad,

or St. Petersburg now, or Vladivostok.

But the fall of the Soviet Union is about a story in which

Vladivostok and St. Petersburg

ended up in one country, and Kyiv, Minsk,

and (speaks foreign language)

ended in different countries.

So the theories

and explanations about how did that happen for me,

this really very helpful theories

for understanding the Soviet collapse.

So the mobilization from below, the collapse

of the center, against the background of economic collapse,

against the background of ideological implosion.

That's how I look at the fall of the Soviet Union

and that's how I look at the theories

that explain that collapse.

- So it's a story of geography, ideology, economics,

which are the most important to understand of

what made the collapse of the Soviet Union happen?

- The Soviet collapse was unique,

but not more unique than collapse of any other empire.

So what we really witnessed,

or the world witnessed back in 1991,

and we continue to witness today

with the Russian aggression against Ukraine, is a collapse

of one of the largest world empires.

We talked about the Soviet Union,

and now talk about Russia as possessing plus, minus,

one sixth of the surface of the earth.

You don't get in possession of one sixth of the earth

by being a nation state.

You get that sort of size as an empire.

And the Soviet collapses continuation of the disintegration

of the Russian Empire that started back in 1917,

that was arrested for some period of time by the Bolsheviks,

by the communist ideology,

which was internationalist ideology,

and then came back in full force in the late eighties

and early nineties.

So the most important story for me, this is the story

of the continuing collapse of the Russian Empire

and the rise of not just local nationalism,

but also rise of Russian nationalism that turned out to be

as a destructive force for the imperial

or multi-ethnic, multinational state,

as was Ukrainian nationalism or Georgian

or Estonian for that matter,

- Well you said a lot of interesting stuff there in 1917,

Bolsheviks, internationalists, how that plays with the idea

of Russian Empire and so on.

But first, let me ask about US influence on this.

So one of the ideas is that, you know, through the Cold War,

that mechanism, US had made your interest

to weaken the Soviet Union,

and therefore the collapse could be attributed to pressure

and manipulation from the United States.

Is there truth to that?

- The pressure from the United States,

this is part of the Cold War

and Cold War part of that story,

but it doesn't explain the Soviet collapse.

And the reason is quite simple.

The United States of America didn't want

the Soviet Union to collapse and disintegrate.

They didn't want that at the start of the Cold War in 1948.

We now have the strategic documents.

They were concerned about that.

They didn't wanna do that,

and certainly they didn't wanna do that

in the 1991, as late August of 1991,

the month of the coup, in Moscow,

president Bush, George HW Bush travels from Moscow

to Kyiv and gives famous,

or infamous speech called Chicken Kyiv speech,

basically warning Ukrainians against going for independence.

The Soviet collapse was a huge headache

for the administration in the White House

for a number of reasons.

They liked to work with Gorbachev.

The Soviet Union was emerging as a junior partner

of the United States on the international arena.

Collapse destroyed all of that.

And on the top of that, there was a question

of the nuclear weapons, unaccounted nuclear weapons.

So the United States was doing everything humanly possible

to keep the Soviet Union together in one piece

until really late November of 1991, when it became clear

that it was, it was a lost cause

and they had to say goodbye to Gorbachev

and to the project that he introduced.

A few months later,

or a year later, there was a presidential campaign,

and Bush was running for the second term

and was looking for achievements.

And there were many achievements.

I basically treat him with great respect,

but destruction of the Soviet Union

was not one of those achievements.

He was on the other side of that divide.

But the politics, the political campaign,

of course have their own rules and they produce

and give birth to mythology with which we still,

at least in this country, we live till now, till today.

- So Gorbachev is an interesting figure in all of this.

Is there a possible history

where the Soviet Union did not collapse

and some of the ideas that Gorbachev had for the future

of the Soviet Union came to life?

- Of course, history, on the one hand, there is a statement.

It doesn't allow for what-ifs.

On the other hand, in my opinion, history is full of

what-if, that's what history is about.

(Lex laughs)

And certainly there are scenarios,

how the Soviet Union

would continue beyond, let's say Gorbachev's tenure.

And the argument has been made that the reforms

that he introduced, that they were mismanaged

and they could be managed differently,

or there could be no reforms

and there could be continuous stagnation.

So that is all possible.

What I think would happen one way

or another is the Soviet collapse in a different form

on somebody else's watch at some later period in time.

Because we're dealing with not just processes

that happening in the Soviet Union,

we're dealing with global processes

and the 20th century turned out to be the century

of the disintegration of the empires.

You look at the globe at the map of the world in 1914,

and you compare it to the map at the end

of the 20th century in 1991, 1992.

And suddenly you realize that there are many candidates

for being the most important event,

the most important process in the 20th century.

But the biggest global thing

that happened was redrawing the map of the world

and producing dozens, if not hundreds of new states.

That's the outcome of the different processes

of the 20th century.

Look, Yugoslavia is falling apart around the same time.

Czechoslovakia goes through

what can be called a civilized divorce, a very,

very rare occurrence in the fall

of multinational states.

So yeah, the writing was on the wall,

whether it would happen under Gorbachev

or later, whether it would happen as the result of reforms

# Chapter 2

That's the outcome of the different processes

of the 20th century.

Look, Yugoslavia is falling apart around the same time.

Czechoslovakia goes through

what can be called a civilized divorce, a very,

very rare occurrence in the fall

of multinational states.

So yeah, the writing was on the wall,

whether it would happen under Gorbachev

or later, whether it would happen as the result of reforms

or as the result of no reforms.

But I think that sooner

or later, that would happen.

- Yeah, it's very possible.

Hundreds of years from now,

the way the 20th century is written about

as the century defined by the collapse of empires.

You call the Soviet Union the last empire.

The book is called The Last Empire.

So is there something fundamental about the way the world is

that means it's not conducive to the formation of empires?

- The meaning that I was putting in the term the Soviet

Union as the last empire was that

that was the Soviet collapse, was the collapse of the

last major European empires, traditional empires

that was there in the 18th century, 19th century,

and through most of the 20th century,

the Austria Hungary died in the midst

of World War I, the Ottoman Empire disintegrated,

the Brits were gone and left India.

And there was the successor

to the Russian Empire called the Soviet Union,

was still hanging on there.

And then came 1991.

And what we see even with today's Russia,

it's a very different sort of policies.

The Russian leadership tried to learn a lesson from 1991,

so there is no national Republics

in the Russian Federation that would have more rights than

the Russian administrative units.

So the structure is different.

The nationality policies are different.

The level of unification is much higher.

So it is in many ways already a

post imperial formation.

- And you're right about that moment in 1991,

the role that Ukraine played in that

seems to be a very critical role.

Can you describe just that

what role Ukraine played in the

collapse of the Soviet Union?

- History is many things,

but it started in a very simple way

of making notes about on the yearly basis

what happened this year at that.

So it's about chronology.

Chronology in the history of the collapse

of the Soviet Union is very important.

You have Ukrainian referendum on December 1st, 1991,

and you have dissolution of the Soviet Union

by the leaders of Russia.

Ukraine and Belarus respond a week later,

and the question is why?

Ukrainian referendum is the answer.

But Ukrainians

didn't answer their referendum question

of whether they want the Soviet Union

to be dissolved or not.

They answered very limited in terms of,

it's been in question whether you support the decision of

(speaks foreign language) of your parliament

for Ukraine to go independent,

and the rest was not on the ballot.

So why then one week later, the Soviet Union is gone?

And President Yeltsin explains to President Bush around

that time, the reason why Ukraine was so important.

He said that, well, if Ukraine is gone,

Russia is not interested in this Soviet project

because Russia would be outnumbered

and outvoted by the Muslim republics.

So there was a cultural element,

but there was also another one.

Ukraine happened to be the second largest Soviet republic

and then post-Soviet state in terms of population, in terms

of the economy, economic potential, and so on and so forth.

And as Yeltsin suggested, close culturally, linguistically

and otherwise to Russia.

So with the second largest republic gone,

Russia didn't think that it was in Russia's interest

to continue with the Soviet Union.

And around that time, Yegor Gaidar

who was the chief economic advisor of Yeltsin,

was telling him, well, we just don't have money anymore

to support other republics.

We have to focus on Russia.

We have to use oil

and gas money within the Russian Federation.

So the state was bankrupt, imperial projects,

at least in the context of the late 20th century,

they costed money.

It wasn't a moneymaking machine

as it was back in the 18th and 19th century,

and the combination of all these factors led

to the processes in which Ukraine's decision

to go independent, spelled the end to the Soviet Union.

And if today anybody wants to restore,

not the Soviet Union,

but some form of Russian control over the post-Soviet space,

Ukraine is as important today

as it was back in December of 1991.

- Lemme ask you about Vladimir Putin's

statement that the collapse of the Soviet Union is one

of the great tragedies of history.

To what degree does he have a point?

To what degree is he wrong?

- His formulation was that this is

the greatest geopolitical catastrophe

or tragedy of the 20th century.

And I specifically went and looked at the text

and put it in specific time when it was happening.

And it was interesting

that the statement was made a few weeks

before the May nine parade

and celebrations of the victory,

a key part of the mythology

of the current Russian state.

So why say things about the

Soviet collapse being

the largest geopolitical tragedy

and not in that particular context, the Second World War?

My explanation at least is that the World War II,

the price was enormous,

but the Soviet Union emerged as a great victor

and captured half of Europe.

1991, in terms of the lives lost at

that point, the price was actually very, very low.

But for Putin, what was important that the state was lost.

And he in particular was concerned about the division

of the Russian people,

which he understood back then,

like he understands now in very, very broad terms.

So for him, the biggest tragedy is not the loss

of life, the biggest tragedy is the loss

of the great power, status,

or the unity of those whom he considered

to be Russian nations.

So at least this is my reading, this is my understanding of

what is there, what is

on the paper and what is between the lines.

- So both the unity of the sort of quote Russian Empire

and the status of the superpower.

- That's how I read it.

- You wrote a book, The Origins of The Slavic Nations.

So let's go back into history.

What is the origin of Slavic nations?

- We can look at that from different perspectives.

And we are now making major breakthroughs

in answering this question with the very interesting,

innovative linguistic analysis, the study of DNA.

So that's really the new frontier.

We're getting into a prehistorical period

where there is no historical sources.

And from what we can understand today,

and that can of course change tomorrow

with all these breakthroughs in sciences, is that

the Slavs came into existence somewhere in the area

of Pripyat marshes, northwestern part

of Ukraine, southwestern part of Belarus,

eastern part of Poland.

And that's is considered to be historical homeland of Slavs.

And then they spread,

and they spread all the way to the Adriatic.

So we have Croats,

we have Russians spreading all the way to the Pacific.

We have Ukrainians, we have Belarusians, Poles.

Once we had Czechoslovaks, now we have Czechs and Slovaks.

So that's the story of starting with the eighth

and ninth century.

We can even a little bit earlier, we can already follow

that story with the help of the written sources,

mostly from Byzantine, then later from Western Europe.

But what I was trying to do, not being a scientist,

not being an expert in linguistics

or not being an expert in DNA analysis,

I was trying to see what was happening in the minds

of those peoples and their lives in particular,

whom we call today

not Slavs, but Eastern Slavs, which means Russians,

Ukrainians and Belarusians.

How they imagine themselves, how they imagine their world.

And eventually I look at the

so-called nation building projects.

So trying to answer the question of how we arrived

to the situation in which we are today,

where there are not just three East Slavic nations,

but there are also three East Slavic states, Russian,

Ukrainian, and Belorussian.

So this is the focus of my book.

And admittedly in that particular book

I end on the 18th century before the era of nationalism.

# Chapter 3

And eventually I look at the

so-called nation building projects.

So trying to answer the question of how we arrived

to the situation in which we are today,

where there are not just three East Slavic nations,

but there are also three East Slavic states, Russian,

Ukrainian, and Belorussian.

So this is the focus of my book.

And admittedly in that particular book

I end on the 18th century before the era of nationalism.

But then there are other books like Lost Kingdom

where I bring the story all the way up to today.

- So what aspects of the eighth

and ninth century, the East Slavic states

permeates to today that we should understand?

- Well, the most important one is that the existence

of the state of Kyivan Rus

back during the medieval period

created a foundations for historical mythology,

common historical mythology.

And there are just wars

and battles over who has the right, or more right

for Kyivan Rus.

The legal code that was created at

that time existed for a long period of time, the acceptance

of Christianity from Byzantium, that became a big issue

that separated then eastern Slavs from their Western

neighbors, including Czechs and Poles.

But united in that way to let's say Bulgarians

or Serbs and the beginning of the written literature,

beginning in Kyiv.

So all of that is considered to be part of heritage.

All of that is being contested.

And this debates that were academic

for a long period of time,

what we see now tragically have been being continued

on the battlefield.

- What is Kyiv, what is Rus that you mentioned?

What's the importance of these?

You mentioned them as the sort of defining places

and terms, labels at the beginning of all of this.

So what is Kyiv?

- Kyiv became a capital

or the outpost of the Vikings

who were trying to establish control over the

trade route between

what is today's Western Russia and Belarus

and Northern Ukraine.

So the forest areas and the biggest

and the richest market in the world that existed at

that time, which was in Constantinople, in Byzantium.

So the idea was to get whatever goods you can get in

that part of Eastern Europe.

And most of those goods were slaves.

Local population put them on the ships in Kyiv

because Kyiv was on the border with the step zones.

Step zones were controlled by other groups,

(speaks foreign language) and so on.

And you name it.

And then staying

on the river being protected from attacks of the moments

to come to the Black Sea

and sell these products in Constantinople.

That was the idea.

That was the model.

Vikings tried to practice that sort of

business model also in other parts of Europe

and like in other parts of Europe, they turned out to be,

by default creators of new politics, of new states.

And that was the story

of the first Kyivan Dynasty

and Kyiv as the capital of that huge empire

that was going from the Baltics to today, central Ukraine,

and then was trying to get through the southern Ukraine

to the Black Sea.

That was a major,

major European state kingdom, if you wanna call it,

of medieval Europe with a lot, creating a lot

of tradition in terms of dynasty, in terms of language,

in terms of religion, in terms of, again,

historical mythology.

So Kyiv is central for the nation building myth

of a number of groups in the region.

- So in one perspective

and narrative, Kyiv is at the center of this Russian empire,

at which point does Moscow come to prominence

as the center of the Russian empire?

- Well, the Russian Empire is a term

and really creation of the 18th century.

What we have for the Kyivan,

and we call it Kyivan Rus.

Again, this is a term of the 19th century.

They call themselves Rus,

and there was metropolitan of Rus

and there was Rus principalities.

So very important to keep in mind that Rus is not Russia,

because that was a self name for all multiple groups on

that territory.

And Moscow doesn't exist at the time when Kyiv

emerges as the capital.

The first reference

to Moscow comes from the 12th century when it was founded

by one of the Kyivan Princes, and Moscow comes

to prominence really in a very different context

and with a very different empire running the show

in the region.

The story of Moscow and the rise of Moscow.

This is the story of the Mongol rule

over former Rus lands and former Rus territories.

The part of the former Rus eventually

overthrows the Mongol control with the help

of the small group

of people called Lithuanians,

which had a young state and young dynasty

and united this lands,

which were mostly in today's terms,

Ukrainian and Belorussian.

So they separate early.

And what is today is Russia, mostly Western Russia,

Central Russia, stays under the Mongol control up

until late 15th century.

And that was the story when Moscow rises

as the new capital of that realm replacing

the city of Vladimir

as that capital for those who ever went

to Russia, they familiar with, of course,

Vladimir as the place of the oldest

architectural monuments, the so-called

the Golden Ring of Russia, and so on and so forth.

Vladimir is central.

And there were so many architectural monuments there,

because before there was Moscow there was Vladimir,

eventually in this struggle over control of the territory,

struggle for favors from the Mongols

and the Tatar horde, Moscow emerges as the center

of that particular realm under Mongols,

after the Mongol rule is removed,

Moscow embarks on the project that historians,

Russian historians of the 19th century called the gathering

of the Russian lands, using Russian now for Rus.

And trying to bring back

the lands of former Kyivan Rus,

but also the lands of the former Mongol empire.

The Russians get to the Pacific

before they get to Kyiv, historically,

and really the quote-unquote gathering of the

quote unquote Russian lands.

And only in 1945 when the Soviet Union

bullies the Czechoslovak government into turning

what is today's Ukraine to the Soviet Union.

It is included in the Ukrainian Soviet socialist republic.

So that's the moment when that destiny, the way

how it was imagined

by the 19th century Russian historian was

eventually fulfilled.

Moscow was in control of all this lands.

- So to what degree are the Slavic people one people?

And this is the theme that will continue throughout,

I think, versus a collection of multiple peoples,

whether we're talking about the Kyivan Rus

or we're talking about the 19th century Russian

empire conception.

- Well, a number of ways to look at that.

One, the most obvious, the most clear is language.

And there is no question that

Poles speak a separate language in their Slavs.

And there is no question for anyone

going to Ukraine,

and hearing Ukrainian realizing that this is not Russian,

the level of comprehension can be different.

You can understand certain words

and you don't understand others.

And the same would be with Polish,

and the same would be with Czech.

So there is this linguistic history

that is in common, but languages very clearly indicate that

you're dealing with different people.

We know that language is not everything,

Americans speak a particular way of English.

Australians speak a particular variant of English.

But for reasons of geography history,

we pretty much believe that despite linguistic unity,

these are different nations and different peoples.

And there are some parts

of political tradition more in common.

# Chapter 4

that is in common, but languages very clearly indicate that

you're dealing with different people.

We know that language is not everything,

Americans speak a particular way of English.

Australians speak a particular variant of English.

But for reasons of geography history,

we pretty much believe that despite linguistic unity,

these are different nations and different peoples.

And there are some parts

of political tradition more in common.

Others are quite different.

So the same when it comes to language,

the same when it comes to political tradition,

to the loyalty to the political institution applies

to Slavic nations.

So again,

there is nothing particularly unique about the

Slavs in that regard.

- You wrote the book, the Cossack Myth,

History and Nationhood in the Age of Empires,

it tells the story of an anonymous manuscript

called the History of the Rus.

It started being circulated in the 1820s.

I would love it if you can tell the story of,

this is supposedly one

of the most impactful texts in history, modern history.

So what's the importance of this text?

What did it contain?

How did it define the future of the region?

- In the first decay of the 19th century,

after Napoleonic Wars, a mysterious text emerged

that was attributed to a orthodox arch bishop

that was long dead,

which was claiming that the Cossacks of Ukraine

were in fact the original Rus people,

and that they had the right

for a particular place for central place

in the Russian Empire.

And it tells the history of the Cossack.

It's the era of romanticism,

full of all sorts of drama.

There are heroes, there are villains,

and the text captivates the attention of

some key figures

in the Russian intellectual elite

in St. Petersburg, people like (speaks foreign language)

who was executed for his participation in 1825 Uprising

writes poetry on the basis of this text.

Pushkin pays attention to it as well.

And then comes along the

key figure in Ukrainian national revival

of the 19th century Ukrainian National Project.

(speaks foreign language) and reads it as well,

and they all read it very differently.

Eventually by the beginning of the

mid 20th century, some of the Russian

mostly nationalist writers called this text

the Quran of Ukrainian nationalism.

So what is there?

The story, it's very important in a sense that

what the authors,

and that's what I claim in the book, what the authors

of the text were trying to say.

They were trying to say that the Cossack elite

should have the same rights as the Russian nobility,

and brings the long historical records to prove

how cool the Cossack were over the period of time.

But at the beginning of the 19th century,

they put this claim already, they used new arguments,

and this arguments are about nation and nationalism,

and they're saying that the Cossack are a separate nation,

and that's a big, big, big claim.

The Russian Empire,

and this is a very, very good argument in historiography,

that Russian empire grew

and acquired this one sixth of the Earth,

by using one very specific way of integrating those lands.

It integrated elites, it was making deals with their elites,

whether their elites were Muslim

or their elites were Roman Catholic,

as the case was with the Poles,

elites would be integrated,

and the empire was made based on that estate,

the state loyalty and the state integration.

But once you bring in the factor of nation

and nationalism and language, then once in a sudden

the whole model of the integration of the elites,

irrespective of their language, religion,

and culture starts falling apart.

And the Poles were the first who really

produced this sort of a challenge

to the Russian empire by two uprisings in the 19th century.

And Ukrainians then followed in their footsteps.

So the text, the importance of the text is that

it was making claim on the part of a particular estate,

the Cossack officer class, which was

that empire could survive.

But it turned it, given the conditions

of the time into the claim for the special role of

Cossack as a nation,

creating that this is a separate nation, a Rus nation.

And that is the challenge of nationalism

that no empire really survived.

And the Russian Empire was not an exception.

So there's a turning point when the discourse switches from

loyalty based on the integration of the elite

to the loyalty based

on attachment to your nation, to your language,

and to your culture and to your history.

- So that was like the initial spark, the flame

that led to nationalist movements.

- That was the beginning and the beginning,

that was building a bridge between the existence

of the Cossack state in the 17th and 18th century.

That was used as a foundation for the Cossack mythology.

Ukrainian national mythology went into the Ukrainian

national anthem and the new age

and the new stage where the Cossack were not there anymore,

where the professors, intellectuals, students, members

of the national and organizations.

And it started of course, with romantic poetry.

It was started with collecting folklore,

and then later goes to the political stage

and eventually the stage of mass politics.

- So to you, even throughout the 20th century under Stalin,

there was always a force within Ukraine

that wants it to be independent.

- There were five attempts for Ukraine

to declare it's independence

and to maintain it in the 20th century,

only one succeeded in 1991.

But there were four different attempts before.

And you see the Ukrainian

national identity manifest in itself

in two different ways, in the form of national communism

after the Bolshevik victory in Bolshevik controlled Ukraine,

and in the form of radical nationalism in the parts

of Ukraine that were controlled by Poland and Romania.

And part of that was also controlled by Czechoslovakia

and later Hungary.

So in those parts outside of the Soviet Union,

the form of the national mobilization, the key form

of national mobilization became radical nationalism in

Soviet Ukraine, it was national communism

that came back in the 1960s and 1970s.

And then in the 1991, the majority

of the members of the Ukrainian parliament who voted

for independence were members of the Communist Party.

So that spirit on a certain level never died.

- So there's national communism and radical nationalism.

Well, let me ask you about the radical nationalism,

because that is a topic that comes up in the discussion

of the war in Ukraine today.

Can you tell me about Stepan Bandera, who was he?

This controversial far-right,

Ukrainian revolutionary?

- The right list two Stepan Banderas.

One is the real person

and another is mythology that really

comes with this name.

And the real person was a young student,

nationalistically oriented student in the late 1920s

and the early 1930s in the part of Ukraine

that was controlled by Poland, who belonged

to the generation who regretted

that they were not born in time for the big struggles

of the World War I

and revolution at that time, they believed

that their fathers lost opportunity for Ukraine

to become independent and that a new ideology was needed,

and that ideology was radical nationalism

and new tactics were needed.

So Bandera becomes the leader

of the organization

of Ukrainian nationalists in Ukraine at the young age

and organizes a number of assassinations

of the Polish officials

or members of the Ukrainian community

who this young people in their

17, 18, 19 considered to be collaborators.

He is arrested, put on trial.

And that's where the myth of Bandera starts

to emerge because he uses the trial

to make statement about the

Ukrainian nationalism, radical nationalism and its goals,

# Chapter 5

and organizes a number of assassinations

of the Polish officials

or members of the Ukrainian community

who this young people in their

17, 18, 19 considered to be collaborators.

He is arrested, put on trial.

And that's where the myth of Bandera starts

to emerge because he uses the trial

to make statement about the

Ukrainian nationalism, radical nationalism and its goals,

and suddenly becomes a hero among

the youth, Ukrainian youth at that time,

he's sentenced for execution, for death.

So when he delivers his speech, he knows that

he probably would die soon.

And then it was the sentence was commuted to life in prison.

Then World War II happens,

the Polish state collapses under the pressure coming,

of course from Nazi Germany.

And the Soviet Union, Bandera walks away

and presides over the act of the split over the organization

of Ukrainian nationalists into two groups.

The most radical one you called Revolutionary,

they call themselves Revolutionary, is led by Bandera.

They worked together with the Nazi Germany at that time,

with the hope that Nazi Germany would deliver them

independent Ukraine.

First days of the German attack,

Nazi attack on the Soviet Union.

The units formed on the basis of organization,

Ukrainian National march into the city of Lviv,

and declare Ukrainian independence.

That was not sanctioned by the German authorities,

that was not in German plans.

So they arrest Bandera, members of his family, his brothers,

leaders of the organization.

So his two brothers go to Auschwitz, die there.

He was sent to Sachsenhausen for

most duration of the war until 1944,

refusing to revoke declaration of Ukrainian independence,

which again, contributes further

to his mythology after the war.

He never comes back to Ukraine.

He lives in exile in Munich.

So between 1930 and his death in 1959,

he spent in Ukraine maybe up to two years,

maybe a little bit more,

but most of the time was either in the Polish prison

or in the German concentration camp or in exile.

But the myth of Bandera lived,

and all the members of the organization

of Ukrainian nationalists

and then the Ukrainian insurgent army

that fought against the Soviets all the way into the early

1950s, they were called Banderites.

They were called Banderites by the Soviet authorities.

They were known also in that way to the local population.

So there was a far away leader that barely was there

on the spot, but whose name was attached

to this movement for really liberation

of Ukraine at that time.

Again, the battle that failed.

- The fact that he collaborated with the Nazis sticks.

For one perspective

he's considered by many to be a hero of Ukraine, fighting

for the independence of Ukraine.

From another perspective, coupled with the fact

that there's this radical, revolutionary extremist flavor

to the way he sees the world.

That label just stays, that he's a fascist, he's a Nazi.

To what degree is this true?

To what degree is it not?

- Nazi, this label is certainly promoted by, first,

by the Soviet propaganda

and then by Russian propaganda.

It works very nicely.

If you focus on the years of collaboration,

those were the same years when Joseph Stalin

collaborated with Hitler.

Right?

So we have the same reason

to call Stalin Nazi collaborator as we have

the reason to call Bandera Nazi collaborator.

We look at the situation in the Pacific,

in Indonesia and other places, the leaders

who worked together with Japanese, with the idea

of promoting independence of their countries

after the Japanese collapse, become leaders of the empire.

So the difference with Bandera is

that he never becomes the leader of empire

and immunity that comes with

that position certainly doesn't apply to him.

But there are other parts of his life,

which certainly put this whole thing in question.

The fate of his family,

his own time in the German concentration camp,

certainly don't fit the propaganda

one-sided image of Bandera.

In terms of him being a hero, that's a very,

very interesting question

because he is perceived in Ukraine today,

not by all, and probably not by the majority,

but by many people in Ukraine as a symbol

of fighting against the Soviet Union

and by extension against Russia and Russian occupation.

So his popularity grew

after February 24th, 2022, as a symbol

of that resistance.

Again, we are talking here about myth and mythology,

because Bandera was not leading the fight against

the Soviet occupation

in Ukraine, because at that time he was just simply

not in Ukraine, he was in Germany.

And you can imagine that geography mattered at

that time much more than it matters today.

- There's a million questions to ask here.

I think it's an important topic

because it is at the center of the claimed reason

that the war continues in Ukraine.

And so I would like to explore

that from different angles.

But just to clarify, was there a moment where Bandera chose

Nazi Germany over the Red Army when the war already began?

So in the list of allegiances,

is Ukraine's independence more important

than fighting Nazi Germany, essentially?

- The Ukrainian independence was their goal,

and they were there to work with anybody

who would support and in one way

or at least allow the Ukrainian independence.

So there is no question that

they're just classic nationalists.

So the goal is,

nationalism is the principle according to which,

or at least one definitions is according

to which the cultural boundaries coincide

with political boundaries.

So their goal was to create political boundaries

that would coincide with the geographic boundaries in the

conditions of the World War II.

And certainly making deals with whoever

would either support, as I said,

or tolerate that project of theirs.

- So I would love to find the line between nationalism,

even extreme nationalism and fascism and Nazim.

So for Bandera the myth and Bandera the person,

to what degree, let's look at some of the ideology of Nazis.

To which degree did he hate Jews?

Was he anti-Semitic?

- We know that basically in his circle, there were people

who were anti-Semites in a sense that, okay,

we have the texts, right?

We know that.

We don't have that information about

or that sort of text

or that sort of evidence with regard to Bandera himself.

In terms of fascism, there is very clear

and there is research done

that in particular Italian fascism

had influence on the thinking of people in

that organization, including people at the top.

But it is also very important to keep in mind

that they called themselves

nationalists and revolutionaries.

And despite the fact that in 1939 and 1940

and 1941, it was very beneficial for them

to declare themselves to be Ukrainian fascists

and establish this bond with, not just

with Italy, but with Nazi Germany.

They refuse to do that,

and then they refuse to recall their independence.

So influences, yes,

but clearly it's a different type of a political project.

- So lemme fast forward into the future

and see to which degree the myth permeates.

Does Ukraine have a neo-Nazi problem?

- My understanding is there are Nazis in Ukraine

and there are supporters of white supremacy theories,

but also my understanding is that they're

extremely marginal

and they're more marginal than the same sort of groups

are in central Europe,

maybe in the US as well.

And for me, the question is

# Chapter 6

and see to which degree the myth permeates.

Does Ukraine have a neo-Nazi problem?

- My understanding is there are Nazis in Ukraine

and there are supporters of white supremacy theories,

but also my understanding is that they're

extremely marginal

and they're more marginal than the same sort of groups

are in central Europe,

maybe in the US as well.

And for me, the question is

not whether the Ukraine has it,

but why even in the conditions of the war,

the radical nationalism and extremism

and white supremacist is such a marginal force

when in the countries that are not at the war, this is this,

you look at France, you look at, again,

it's not exactly national,

but really right, radical right

is becoming so important.

Why Ukraine and the conditions of the war

is the country that

manages relations between different ethnic groups

and languages in the way that strengthens political nation.

So for me, as a scholar,

and a researcher, what I see is that in Ukraine,

the influence of the far right

in different variations is much lower than it is

among some of Ukraine's neighbors

and in Europe in general.

And the question is why, I don't know, I have guesses.

I don't know answer.

But that's the question

that I think is interesting to answer.

How Ukraine ended up

to be the only country in the world outside of Israel

who has a Jewish president, who is,

my at least understanding,

is the most popular president in history in terms of

how long his popularity goes after the election.

So this are the really, from my point of view,

interesting, interesting questions

and again, we can certainly debate that.

- So just for context,

the most popular far right party won 2.15%

of the vote in 2019, this is before the war.

So that's where things stood.

It's unclear where they stand now.

It'd be an interesting question whether it escalated

and how much, what you're saying is that war in general

can serve as a catalyst for expansion of extremist groups

of extremist nationalistic groups,

especially like the far right.

And it's interesting to see to what degree they have

or have not risen to power sort of in the shadows.

- So no nationalist

or nationalistic party actually crossed the barrier

to get into the parliament.

So Ukraine is the country where there is no right

or far right in the parliament.

We can't say that about Germany,

we can't say that about France.

So that's just one more way

to stress this unique place of Ukraine in that sense.

And the year 2019 is the year already of the war.

The war started in 2014 with the annexation of the Crimea.

The frontline was near Donbas.

All these groups are fighting there.

So Ukraine, maybe not to a degree that it is now,

was already on the war footing.

And yet, the right party couldn't get more than 2%.

So that's the question that I have in mind.

And yes, the war historically

of course puts forward

and makes from the more nationalist views

and forces turn them from marginal forces

into more central ones.

We talked about Bandera

and we talked about organization of Ukrainian nationalists.

They were the most marginal group in the political spectrum

in Ukraine in the 1930s that one can only imagine.

But World War II comes

and they become the most central group

because they also were from the start, go, they knew

they had the organization.

Violence was basically one of their means.

They knew how to fight.

So historically, war did produce those results.

So we're looking at Ukraine, we're trying

to see what is happening there.

- So Vladimir Putin in his interview with Tucker Carlson,

but many times

before said that the current goal for the war in Ukraine

is denazification, that the purpose

of the war is denazification.

Can you explain this concept of denazification

as Putin sees it?

- Denazification is the trope

that is accepted quite well

by the former Soviet population and Russian population.

In particular, the most powerful mythology,

Soviet mythology that then was basically passed as part

of heritage to the Russian Federation

was World War II, was fighting against fascism.

So once you use terms fascism and Nazi

and denazification,

suddenly people not just start listening,

they just stop analyzing.

An as a propaganda tool this is

of course very, very powerful tool,

in terms of to what degree this is the real goal or not,

we discussed the importance of the far right

in Europe and in Ukraine.

So if that's the real goal of the war,

probably the war would have to start not against Ukraine,

but probably against France

or some other country if you take this at face value.

- Well, there's something really interesting here,

as you mentioned that's spoken to a lot of people in Russia,

and you said analysis stops,

in the West, people look at the word denazification

and look at the things we've just discussed

and kind of almost think, this is absurd.

When you talk to people in Russia,

maybe it's deep in there somewhere, the history

of World War II still reverberates through the,

maybe the fears, maybe the pride,

whatever the deep emotional history is there.

It seems that the goal of denazification appears

to be reasonable for people in Russia.

They don't seem to see the absurdity or the complexity

or the even the need for analysis, I guess in this kind

of statement, word of denazification .

- I'll say this is broader.

The war that started under the banner that Russians

and Ukrainians were one and the same people

and produces that sort of casualty,

really goes against also some, any sort

of logical thinking.

But the Russia is a place

where the free press doesn't exist already

for a long period of time.

Russia is the place where there is

an echo chamber to a degree.

And as war started first in 2014,

and then all out war in 2022,

I came across a lot of people on the personal level,

but also in the media reporting

that they really can't find common language

with their close relatives in Russia, people

who visited Ukraine, who know that it is not taken over

by nationalists and is not taken over by Nazis.

But the media around them, the neighbors around them,

the people that they work basically say one

and the same thing.

And we as humans in general, whatever our background,

we are very, very, our mind is really,

it's relatively easy to manipulate it

and to a degree that even even family connections

and even family ties don't sometimes help

to maintain that ability to think

and to analyze on your own, to look at at the facts.

- So Putin has alluded

to the Yaroslav Hunka incident in the Canadian parliament

September, 2023.

This man is a veteran

of World War II on the Ukrainian side,

and he got two standing ovations in the Canadian parliament,

but they later found out that he was part of the SS.

So can you explain on this, what are your thoughts on this?

This had a very big effect on the narrative, I guess

propagated throughout the region.

- Yes.

What happened during World War II

was that once the Germans started to run out

of manpower, they created

sort of foreign legion groups.

But because those people were not Aryans,

they were created for fighting

on the battleground

because they were not Aryans, they couldn't be trusted.

So they were put under the command of Heinrich Himmler

under command of SS

and became known as SS Waffen units.

And one of such units was created in Ukraine

with great difficulties

because Nazis didn't consider Slavs to be generally

worthy of even even that sort

of foreign legion formations.

But they made an exception

because those people were coming from Galatia,

which was part of Austria Hungary,

which means part of Austria,

which means somehow were open to the benevolent influence

of the Germanic race

and called the Division Galatian, or Galatia,

# Chapter 7

because Nazis didn't consider Slavs to be generally

worthy of even even that sort

of foreign legion formations.

But they made an exception

because those people were coming from Galatia,

which was part of Austria Hungary,

which means part of Austria,

which means somehow were open to the benevolent influence

of the Germanic race

and called the Division Galatian, or Galatia,

part of Ukrainian youth joined the Galatian division.

The one of the explanations was

that they were looking at the experience of World War I

and seeing that the units,

the Ukrainian units in the Austrian army then played a very

important role in the fight for independence.

So that is one of the explanations.

You can't just use one explanation

to describe motivations of everyone

and every single person who was joined in there.

So they were sent to the front,

they were defeated within a few short days

by the Red Army.

And then were retreating through

Slovakia where they were used to fight

with the partisan movement there

and eventually surrendered to the British.

So that's the story.

You can personally maybe understand

what the good motivations were

of this person or that person.

But that is one of the best, one of the very tragic

and unfortunate pages

in Ukrainian history.

You can't justify that as a phenomenon.

So from that point of view, the celebration

of that experience as opposed to looking at that, okay,

that happened.

And we wish that tho those young men

who were idealistic

or joined the division for idealistic purposes had

better understanding of things or made other choices.

But you can't certainly celebrate it.

And once that happened, that of course became

a big propaganda item in the current war,

we're talking about about 10

to 20,000 people in the division,

and we're talking about two

to 3 million Ukrainians fighting in the Red Army.

And again, it's not like Red Army's

is completely blameless in the way how it behaved

in Prussia in Germany and so on and so forth.

But it's basically, again,

we are going back to the story of Bandera.

So there is a period of collaboration

and that's what propaganda tries to define him by.

Or there is a division Galatian by 20,000 people

and somehow it makes irrelevant, the experience of two

to 3 million people.

- I mean, just to clarify,

I think there's just a blunder on the Canadian parliament

side, the Canadian side of not doing research of, maybe,

correct me if I'm wrong,

but from my understanding, they were just doing

stupid shallow political stuff.

Let's applaud, you know, when Zelenskyy shows up,

let's have a Ukrainian veteran, let's applaud a veteran

of World War II, and then all of a sudden you realize, well,

there's actually complexities towards, we can talk about,

for example, a lot of dark aspects on all sides

of World War II, the mass rape at the end of World War II

by the Red Army.

When they say martial German, there's a lot

of really dark complexity in it on all sides.

So, you know, that could be an opportunity

to explore the dark complexity that some

of the Ukrainians were in the SS,

or Bandera, the complexities there.

But I think they were doing not a complex thing.

They were doing a very shallow applaud,

and we should applaud veterans, of course.

But in that case, they were doing it for show,

for Zelenskyy and so on.

So we should clarify that the applause wasn't knowing,

it wasn't for the SS, (laughs) it was for a Ukrainian,

it was for World War II veterans, but the propaganda,

or at least an interpretation from the Russian

side, from whatever side is

that they were applauding the full person standing

before them, which wasn't just a Ukrainian veteran,

but Ukrainian veteran that fought for the SS.

- I don't have any particular insights,

but I would be very much surprised if even one person

in the parliament, I mean the members

of the parliament actually knew the whole story.

I would be very surprised.

- Yeah, the whole story of this person,

and frankly the whole story of Ukraine and Russia

and World War II period.

- Yes, yes.

- Nevertheless, it had a lot of power

and really reverberated in support of the narrative

that there is a neo-Nazi, a Nazi problem in Ukraine.

- This is the narrative that is out there,

and especially powerful in Russia,

it's especially powerful in Russia, given that there are

really the atmosphere

that has created really is not conducive

to any independent analysis.

- Well, I wonder what is the most effective way to respond

to that particular claim?

Because there could be a discussion about nationalism

and extreme nationalism and the fight for independence

and whether it isn't like Putin wrote, one people,

but the question of are there Nazis in Ukraine seems

to be a question that could be

analyzed rigorously with data.

- That is being done on the academic level.

But in terms of the public response

and public discourse, the only response

that I see is not to focus

on the questions raised and put by the propaganda,

because you already become victim

of that propaganda by definition.

But talk about that much broadly

and talk about different aspects,

or if it is World War II, about different aspects

of World War II, if it's about issue

of the far right in Ukraine, let's talk about US,

let's talk about Russia, let's talk about France.

Let's compare.

That's the only way how you deal

with propaganda, because propaganda is not necessarily

something that is an outright lie.

It can be just one factor

that's taken outta the context

and is blown out of proportion.

And that is good enough.

- And the way to defend against that is

to bring in the context.

Let us move gracefully throughout, back

and forth through history.

Back to Bandera, you wrote a book on the KGB spy

Bogdan Stashinsky.

Can you tell his story?

- This is a story of the history of the organization

of Ukrainian nationalists and Bandera as well already

after the end of the second World War,

because what you got

after the second World War, so imagine May of 1945,

the red banner is all over Riksdag.

The Red Army is in control of half of Europe,

but the units of the Red Army are still fighting the war,

and not just behind the Soviet lines,

but within the borders of the Soviet Union.

And this war continues all the way into the early 1950s

up to almost up to Stalin's death.

The war is conducted by the organization

of Ukrainian nationalists,

which have a Ukrainian insurgent army.

And the government tries to crush that resistance.

So what it does is basically recruits local people

to spy on the partisans on the underground.

And Bogdan Stashinsky is one of those people.

His family is supporting the resistance.

They provide food.

His sister is engaged with one of the local

commanders of this underground unit.

And they know everything about Stashinsky's family

and they know everything about him

because he is also collecting funds for the underground.

So they have a conversation with him saying that, okay,

that's what we got.

And you and your family can go to to prison

or you help us a little bit.

We're interested in the fiance

of your sister, and we wanna get him.

And Stashinsky says yes.

And once they round up the fiance,

he basically betrayed a member

or almost member of his family.

He is done.

He can't go back to his village.

He can't go back to his study.

He was studying in Lviv at that time.

So he becomes, as I write in my book,

the secret police becomes his family.

And he is sent to Kyiv.

He is trained for two years, sent to East Germany,

into Berlin and becomes an assassin.

So they sent him across the

border to Western Germany, to Munich,

which was the headquarter of different

organizations, anti-Soviet organizations, Ukrainian

and Russian and Georgian and so on and so forth.

And he kills two leaders

of the organization of Ukrainian nationalists, one editor

# Chapter 8

And he is sent to Kyiv.

He is trained for two years, sent to East Germany,

into Berlin and becomes an assassin.

So they sent him across the

border to Western Germany, to Munich,

which was the headquarter of different

organizations, anti-Soviet organizations, Ukrainian

and Russian and Georgian and so on and so forth.

And he kills two leaders

of the organization of Ukrainian nationalists, one editor

of the newspaper, and eventually he kills Bandera.

He does that with the new weapon,

a spray pistol that eventually makes it into the Bond

novel, The Man With The Golden Gun.

And that whole episode is a little bit reshaped,

but it's not in the film, but it's in the novel itself.

And then later has a change of mind under the influence

of his German fiance and then wife.

They decide to escape to the west.

And while they're doing that, they discover that their

apartment was bugged, and probably the KGB knows

all of that.

so a long story short, his son dies

in Berlin, the KGB doesn't allow him to go there,

but his wife has a nervous breakdown.

So they allow him to go there to just calm her so

that there would be no scandal.

And two of them, one day

before their son's burial,

because after that they would be sent to Moscow.

They jumped the ship

and go to West Berlin, two hours

before the Berlin Wall was being built.

So if they would stay for the funeral,

probably the KGB would not let them go.

But also if they would stay,

the border would be there.

And he goes to the American intelligence

and says, okay, that's who I am,

and that's what I did.

And they look at him and they say, we don't trust you.

We dunno who you are, you have documents in five names.

You say you killed Bandera.

Well, we have a different information.

He was poisoned and probably by someone

in his close circle.

A spray pistol?

Did you read too much Ian Fleming,

where does this come from?

He insists, they said, okay,

you insist, if you committed all those crimes,

we're giving you to the German police.

And German police will be investigating you.

And then the trial comes.

And if he takes back his testimony,

the whole case against him collapses, he can go free.

But he knows that if he goes free, he is a target

of his colleagues from the same department.

So his task at the trial is to prove that he's guilty,

that he did that.

And then he disappears and nobody knows where he goes.

And there are all sorts of cover stories.

And I was lucky to interview a commander, former chief

of the South African police, confirmed to me that

Stashinsky was in South Africa.

- He fled.

- The West German intelligence thought

that it was too dangerous for him to stay in Germany.

They sent him under a different name

to South Africa.

So that's the story of Stashinsky himself.

But going back to Bandera, of course, the fact that

he confessed and it became known

that KGB assassinated Bandera, that added to the

image and to general mythology about Bandera.

- What a fascinating story

of a village boy becoming an assassin who killed one

of the most influential revolutionaries of the region

in the 20th century.

So just zooming out broadly then in KGB,

how powerful was the KGB?

What role did it play in this whole

story of the Soviet Union?

- It depends on the period.

At the time that we just described, late fifties

and early sixties, they were not powerful at all.

And the reasons for that was that

people like (speaks foreign language)

were really concerned about the secret

police becoming too powerful.

It became too powerful in their mind under Stalin.

And it was concern about

Beria's power as a secret police chief that led to the

coup against Beria and Kryuchkov come into power

and Beria was arrested and executed.

And what Kryuchkov was trying to do

after that was trying to put

since '54, the name was already KGB,

KGB under his control.

So he was appointing the former council leaders

as the heads of the KGB.

So the people who really,

really owned everything to him, that sort of position

and the heads of the KGB were not members of (indistinct),

it changed in the seventies with Andropov where KGB

started to play again, very important role

in the Soviet history

and let's say decisions on Afghanistan

and the Soviet troops marching into Afghanistan were made

apart from Beria, by the trio of the

people who are not,

would be called today, (speaks foreign language)

or not all of them were (speaks foreign language)

but one of course was Andropov, the head of the KGB.

Another was the Minister of Defense.

And then there was secretary in charge

of the military Industrial Complexity,

Minister of Foreign Affairs.

So, the head

of the KGB became really

not just the member of (speaks foreign language)

but the member of that inner circle.

And then the fact that Andropov

succeeds Beria is also a manifestation of the power

that KGB acquired really

after Kryuchkov in the 1970s

and then going into the 1980s.

- Who was more powerful, the KGB

or the CIA during the Soviet Union?

- The CIA, it's the organization that

is charged with the

information gathering

and all sorts of operations including assassinations

in the fifties and sixties abroad.

The KGB was the organization that really

had both the surveillance

over the population within the Soviet Union

and also the operations abroad.

And its members,

its leaders were members of the inner circle

for making decisions.

Again, from what I understand about the way

how politics and decision work

and decisions are made in the United States,

the chief of the CIA is not one

of the decision making group

that providing information.

Yes.

So I would say it's not day and night,

but their power, political influence,

political significance, very different.

- Is it understood how big the KGB was,

how widespread it was, given its secretive

and distributed nature?

- Certain things we know, others we don't

because the Stasi archives are open

and most of the KGB,

especially in Moscow, they're not.

But we know that the KGB combined not only the

internal sort of a secret police functions at home

and counterintelligence branch

and intelligence branch abroad,

but also the border troops, for example.

Right?

So really institutionally

it was a huge, huge mammoth.

And another thing that we know, we can sort

of extrapolate from what we know

from the Stasi archives, that the surveillance at home,

the surveillance was really massive.

The guess is, the soviets were not as effective

and as meticulous and as scrupulous

and as methodical as probably as Germans were.

But that gives you a basic idea

of how penetrated the entire society was.

- What do you think is important to understand

about the KGB?

If we want to also understand Vladimir Putin,

since he was a KGB foreign intelligence officer

for 16 years.

- From my research, including on the Stashinsky,

what I understand is that

in KGB, and it was a powerful organization, again,

less powerful in fifties and sixties,

but still very powerful organization.

There was on the one hand the understanding

of the situation in the country

and abroad that probably

other organizations didn't have.

They had also first pick in terms of selection,

the work in the KGB was well paid

and considered to be very prestigious.

So that was part to the degree

of the Soviet elite in terms of

whom they recruited.

And they had a resentment over the party leadership.

They didn't allow them to do James Bond kind of things

# Chapter 9

and abroad that probably

other organizations didn't have.

They had also first pick in terms of selection,

the work in the KGB was well paid

and considered to be very prestigious.

So that was part to the degree

of the Soviet elite in terms of

whom they recruited.

And they had a resentment over the party leadership.

They didn't allow them to do James Bond kind of things

that they would wanna do because there were political risks

after this scandal with Stashinsky,

at least on many levels, the KGB stopped

the practice of the assassinations,

political assassinations abroad

because it was considered politically

to be extremely, extremely dangerous.

The person who was in charge of the KGB at the time

of Bandera assassination, Shelepin,

was one of the candidates to replace Kryuchkov

and Brezhnev used against him that scandal abroad

eventually to remove him from (speaks foreign language)

so the KGB was really looking at the party leadership

strategically as ineffective, corrupt

and who was on their way.

And from what I understand, that's exactly

the attitudes that people

like Putin and people of his circle brought

to power in Kremlin.

So the methods that KGB use they can use now.

And there is no party

or no other other institution actually stopping

them from doing that.

And the thing about, my understanding

the operations abroad about foreign policy in general in

terms of the KGB mindset of planning operations

and executing particular operations and so on and so forth.

So I think a lot of culture that

came into existence in the Soviet KGB now became part

of the culture of the Russian establishment.

- You wrote the book, the Russo-Ukrainian War,

The Return of History, that gives the full

context leading up to the invasion

of Ukraine by Russia in February, 2022.

So can you take me through the key moments in history

that led up to this war?

So we'll mention the collapse of the Soviet Union.

We could probably go much farther back,

but the collapse of the Soviet Union mentioned 2014.

Maybe you can highlight key moments

that led up to 2022.

- The key moments would be first

the (speaks foreign language)

known as Oragne Revolution in Ukraine,

and then in 2014, known as the Revolution of dignity.

Both were the revolts against something that

by significant part of Ukrainian population was considered

to be completely,

completely unacceptable actions on the part

of the government and people in the government at that time.

So the Orange Revolution of 204

was a protest against falsified presidential elections

and rejection of a candidate that was supported

by Russia, publicly supported by Russia.

I remember being in Moscow at that time

and couldn't believe my eyes when in the center of Russia,

I saw a billboard with Yanukovych.

The trick was that there were a lot of Ukrainians

in Russia and in Moscow in particular,

and they had the right to vote.

So, and it led to the election of

Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych,

who put on the agenda the issue

of Ukraine's membership in NATO.

So it was very clear pro-Western orientation.

And the second case was the Revolution of Dignity

2013 with some of the same characters

including Yanukovych who at

that time was already president of Ukraine.

And there, the question was of the government

promising the people for one year at least

to sign association agreement with European Union

and then turning over almost overnight

and saying that they were not going to do that.

And that's how things started.

But then when they became really massive

and why something that was called revolution,

Euro revolution became Revolution of Dignity

was when the government police

beat up students in downtown Kyiv,

who judging by the reports were basically already,

almost ready to disperse, almost ready to go home.

And that's when roughly half

of Kyiv showed up on the streets.

That sort of, the police behavior, that sort of,

was absolutely unacceptable in Ukraine.

Still in elections

and falsification of elections was unacceptable.

That's where, around that time

and around 204, the president of Ukraine at that time,

Leonid Kuchma, writes a book called

Ukraine is Not Russia.

And apparently the term comes from

his discussion with Putin.

When Putin was suggesting to him quite strongly

to use force against people on the square in Kyiv.

And Kuchma allegedly said,

"You don't understand.

Ukraine is not Russia,

you can't do things like that.

You get pushback."

And that's this two events 204

and then 2013 became really crucial point in terms of the

Ukraine direction, the survival of Ukrainian democracy,

which is one of very few countries in the post-Soviet space

where democracy survived the original flirt

between the government leaders

and democracy of the 1990s.

It was the whole Soviet story in Russia,

everywhere else there was high democratic expectations,

but they came pretty much to an end

by the end of the decade.

Ukraine preserved the democracy

and the orientation of Ukraine

toward integration in some form, into Western

and European structures, that

Ukrainian democracy plus Western orientation was something.

And in Russia, we see the strengthening

of the autocratic regime under Putin, that

if you look deeper, these are the processes

that put two countries on the collision course.

- So there's a division, a push

and pull inside Ukraine on identity of whether they're part

of Russia or part of Europe.

And you highlighted two moments in Ukrainian history that

there's a big flare up where the statement

was first Ukraine is not Russia,

and essentially Ukraine is part of Europe,

but there's other moments.

What were the defining moments

that began an actual war?

- The war started in February of 2014,

with the Russian takeover of Crimea

by military force, right?

The so-called Green Man.

And the big question is why,

and it's very important to go back to the year 2013

and the start of the protests

and the story of the Ukraine signing association

agreement with European Union.

So from what we understand today,

the Ukrainian government under President Yanukovych,

did this suicidal sharp turn

after one year of promising

association agreement saying that, okay,

we changed our mind under pressure from Moscow.

And Moscow applied that pressure

for one reason, at least in my opinion,

the Ukraine signing an association agreement

with European Union would mean

that Ukraine would not be able to sign association agreement

with any Eurasian union in any shape or form.

That was, at that time in the process of making,

and for Vladimir Putin, that was the beginning of his,

or part of his third term, one of his

agenda items for the third term was really a consolidation

of the post-Soviet space and Eurasian space,

and not membership in NATO,

not membership in European Union,

but association agreement with European Union meant that

that post-Soviet space would have

to exist under Moscow's control,

but without Ukraine,

the second largest post-Soviet Republic,

the republic on whose vote depended the

continuing existence of the Soviet Union

and whose vote ended

in many ways the existence of the Soviet Union.

So that is broadly background,

but also there are of course personalities,

there are also their beliefs,

the readings of history.

And all of that became part of the story.

# Chapter 10

the second largest post-Soviet Republic,

the republic on whose vote depended the

continuing existence of the Soviet Union

and whose vote ended

in many ways the existence of the Soviet Union.

So that is broadly background,

but also there are of course personalities,

there are also their beliefs,

the readings of history.

And all of that became part of the story.

But if you look at that geopolitically,

the association agreement is

putting Ukraine outside of the Russian sphere of influence.

And the response was an attempt

to topple the government in Kyiv that clearly was going

to sign that agreement to take over Crimea

and to help to deal with a lot

of issues within Russia itself

and boost the popularity of the president.

And it certainly worked in that way as well.

And once Ukraine still,

after Crimea continued on its path,

then the next step started the

so-called hybrid warfare in Donbas.

But again, unlike Crimea from what I understand,

Russia was not really looking forward to taking possession

of Donbas, Donbas was viewed as the way

to influence Ukraine,

to stop if from drift towards the west.

- Maybe you can tell me about the region of Donbas.

- I mentioned that nationalism

and principle of nationalism is the principle of

making the political borders to coincide

with ethnic and cultural borders.

And that's how the maps of

many East European countries had been drawn in the

19th and 20th century.

On that principle, Donbas,

where the majority constituted by the beginning

of the 20th century were Ukrainians was considered

to be Ukrainian and was claimed

in the middle of this revolution and revolutionary wars

and civil wars by Ukrainian government.

But Donbas became a site, one

of the key sites in the Russian empire

of early industrialization,

and its mining industry with mythological industry.

So what that meant was that people from other parts of,

not Ukraine, but other parts

of the Russian empire congregated there,

that's where jobs were.

That's how Kryuchkov

and his family came to Donbas, the family

of Brezhnev overshoot a little bit.

They got to the industrial enterprises in the city

of Kaminsk,

the city that was called. (speaks foreign language)

So those were Russian peasants moving into the area

looking for the job.

And the population became quite mixed.

Ukrainians still constituted the majority of the population,

but not necessarily in the towns and in the cities.

And culturally, the place was becoming more

and more Russian as the result of that moment.

So apart from the Crimea,

Donbas was the part of Ukraine

where the ethnic Russians were

the biggest group.

They were not the majority,

but they were very, very big and significant group.

For example, in the city of Mariupol, that was all

but destroyed in the course of the last two years,

the ethnic Russians constituted over 40%

of the population, right?

So that's not exactly part of Donbas,

but that gives you general idea.

Now the story of Donbas

and what happened now is multidimensional.

And this ethnic composition is just one part of the story.

Another very important part of the story is economy.

And Donbas is a classical rust belt.

And we know what happens with the cities that were part

of the first or second wave

of industrialization in the United States and globally,

know about social problems that exist in those places.

So Donbas is probably the most dramatic

and tragic case of implosion of the rust belt

with the mines not anymore producing the sort of,

and at the acceptable price, the coal that they used

to produce, these people losing jobs

with the politicians looking for subsidies as opposed

to trying very unpopular measures of

dealing something and bring new money

and new investment into the region.

So all of that become part of the story

that made it easy for Russia,

for the Russian Federation to destabilize the situation.

We have interviews with Mr. Girkin

who is saying that he was the first

who pulled the trigger

and fired the shot in that war.

He became the Minister of Defense in

the people's republic.

You look at the prime minister, he is another person with

Moscow residency permit.

So you see key figures

in those positions at the start

and the beginning, not being Russians from Ukraine,

but being Russians from Russia

and Russians from Moscow closely connected

to the government structure

and intelligence structure and so on.

So that is the start and the beginning.

But the way how it exploded the way it did

was also a combination of the economic and ethnocultural

and linguistic factors.

- So for Putin, the war on Donbas

and even in 2022 is a defensive war against

what the Ukrainian government is doing against ethnically

Russian people of Donbas.

Is that fair to say how he describes it?

- What we see, this is certainly the argument, right?

This is certainly the argument and a pretext

because what we see there is

that there would be no,

and there was no independent mobilization in Crimea either,

in Crimea, in Donbas, without Russian presence,

without Russian occupation de facto of the Crimea,

there would've been no, and there was no

before, at least in the previous five

to six years, any mass mobilizations of Russians,

there was none of such mobilizations in Donbas

before Gerkin and other people with military,

with parts of military units showed up there.

So it is an excuse, you've been

to Ukraine, you know that Russian language is not

persecuted in Ukraine.

And if you've not been to Donbas, it would be difficult

or to the Crimea it would be difficult

to find one single Ukrainian school.

Not that they didn't exist at all,

but it would take quite an effort for you to find it

or sometimes even to hear Ukrainian language outside either

of the institutions or the farmer's market.

So that's the reality.

That's the reality that is clear, that is visible.

So imagine under those conditions

and context that someone is persecuting

ethnic Russians or Russian speakers,

to believe in something like that,

one important precondition is

never to step your foot in Ukraine.

- I should mention maybe this is a good moment to mention,

when I traveled to Ukraine, this is

after the start of the war,

You mentioned farmer's market, which is funny.

Basically every single person I talked to,

including the leadership, we spoke in Russian.

For many of them, Russian is the more

comfortable language even.

And the people who spoke Ukrainian are more on

the western side of Ukraine.

And you know, young people that are kind of wanting to show

that in an activist way that they want to fight

for the independence of their country.

So I take your point, I wonder if you wanna comment about

language and maybe about the future of language in Ukraine,

is the future of language going to stabilize on

Ukrainian or is it going to return

to its traditional base of Russian language?

- Very roughly before the start of the war in 2014,

we can talk about parity between Russian and Ukrainian

and also with, as you said,

clearly Ukraine being a dominant language in the west

and Russian being a dominant language on the streets,

certainly in the east of the country.

And then in between of that

to pause a number of these transitional areas

and Ukraine in my experience,

# Chapter 11

to its traditional base of Russian language?

- Very roughly before the start of the war in 2014,

we can talk about parity between Russian and Ukrainian

and also with, as you said,

clearly Ukraine being a dominant language in the west

and Russian being a dominant language on the streets,

certainly in the east of the country.

And then in between of that

to pause a number of these transitional areas

and Ukraine in my experience,

and I visited a lot of countries, not all of them,

and probably, maybe I'll be still surprised,

but in my experience,

this is the only truly bilingual

country that I ever visited.

I lived in Canada for a long period of time.

There is Quebec in the West.

And in Ukraine, you can talk in either Russian

or Ukrainian in any part of the country,

and you would be understood

and you would be responded in a different language

with the expectation that you would understand.

And if you don't understand,

that means you don't come from Ukraine.

That's the reality.

The war and loss of the Crimea

and partial loss of Donbas, of it's major industrial areas

really shifted the balance toward mostly

Ukrainian speaking regions.

And also what you see,

and you clearly pointed to that, starting

with 2014, even a little bit earlier,

the younger generation chooses Ukrainian

as a marker of its identity.

And that started in 2014.

But we have a dramatic shift after 2022.

And on the anecdotal level, I can tell you

that I speak to people who

be in Geneve at the time, this is east

of Crimea at the time of the Russian aggression

and bombardment and so on

and so forth, who had passive knowledge of Ukrainian,

but spoke all their life Russian.

And they would speak Ukrainian to me.

And when I say, okay, why you doing that?

We know each other for decades

and you used Russian?

And he said, "Oh, I don't wanna have anything in common

with people who did that to us."

So there is a big, big push of course

with this current war.

Now the question is whether this change is something

that will stay or not, what is the future?

Linguistic practices are very, very conservative ones.

And we at the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute have a

project called (speaks foreign language)

digital atlas of Ukraine.

And we were documenting

and mapping different data in time.

And what we noticed a spike in the people self reporting

of use of Ukrainian in 2014

and 2015, at the time of the start of the war, when

the threat was the most clear one,

this is self-reporting.

That doesn't mean that people exactly do what,

but they believe that that's what they're supposed to do

and then return back to where it was

by the year 2016 and 2017.

And so this dynamic can repeat itself,

but given the how long the war is going on,

how big the impact is, how big the stress is,

and that the wave of the future

is probably associated with younger people

who are switching to Ukrainian.

So my bet would be on

Ukrainian language rising in prominence.

- So as we get closer to February of 2022,

there's a few other key moments.

Maybe let's talk about in July, 2021,

Putin publishing an essay titled On The Historical Unity

of Russians and Ukrainians.

Can you describe the ideas expressed in this essay?

- The idea is very conveniently presented

already in the first paragraph,

in the first sentences really of the article

where Putin says that

"For a long time I was saying the Russians

and Ukrainians were one and the same people.

And here is the proof.

This is the historical,"

he develops his historical argumentation apparently

with the help of a lot of people around him.

And he started to talk about Russians

and Ukrainians being one and the same people one year

before the start of the war in 2014.

So in 2013 he was together with Patriarch Kirill

on visit to Kyiv,

and there was a conference specifically organized

for him in the Kyivan Monastery.

And that's where he stated that

the fact that he was with Patriarch Kirill is very important

factor for understanding where the idea is coming from.

This is the idea

that was dominant in the Russian empire of the 19th

and the beginning of the 20th century.

That Russians, Ukrainians,

and Belarusians are really Russian, great Russians,

little Russians and white Russians,

and that they constitute one people.

Yes, there are some dialectical differences.

Yes, Ukrainians sing well, yes, they dance funny.

But overall that doesn't matter.

And that idea actually was

really destroyed, mostly destroyed by the revolution

of 1917 because it wasn't just social revolution.

That's how it is understood

in US, in good part of the world.

It was also national revolution.

It was an empire, it was a revolution

in the Russian Empire.

And to bring this pieces

of empire back within the Soviet Union,

the Bolsheviks had to make concessions.

And one of those concessions was to recognition

of the existence of Ukrainians as a separate nation,

Belarusians as a separate nations, Russians

as separate nations, endowing them

with their own territorial, with borders,

with institutions and so on and so forth.

But there was one institution that was not reformed,

that institution was called the Russian Orthodox Church.

'Cause one of the ways that Bolsheviks dealt with it,

they couldn't eradicate religion completely,

but they arrested the development

of the religion and thinking and theology on the level

as it existed before the revolution of 1917.

So the Russian Orthodox Church of 1917 continued

to be the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991.

And in 2013,

continuing the same imperial mantra of the existence

of one big Russian nation, one unified people.

And when you see the formation

of the ideas about nations,

about foreign policy in the Russian empire

after 1991, they're going back to the

pre-Bolshevik times.

Ukrainians do that as well.

Estonians do that as well.

The difference is that when Ukrainians go back,

they go back to the pre 1917,

the intellectual fathers

and writings of basically liberal nationalism

or sometimes they go to the radical nationalism of Bandera,

which would be not pre-1917, but pre-1945.

When the Russians go

to pre-Bolshevik past looking for the ideas, looking

for inspiration, looking for the narratives,

what they find there is empire,

what they find there are imperial projects.

And that's certainly the story

of the Putin's claim.

That's the story of the argument.

And to conclude the argument

that he lays out there historical argument

comes also almost directly from the narratives

of the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

So it's not only the argument is coming from that era,

but also the argumentation

is coming from that era as well.

- But that those arguments are all

in the flavor of empire.

- It's empire on the one hand.

But also there is imperial understanding of

what Russian nation is that doesn't allow for independence

of its little Russian

and white Russian branches, alleged branches.

Right?

So what what you see with the concept

of the big Russian nation,

that's late 19th beginning 20th century

empire sees the writing on the wall,

that nationalism is on the rise

and it tries to survive by mobilizing

the nationalism of the largest group in the empire,

which happens to be Russian.

Stalin is a big promoter of some form

of Russian nationalism, especially

during the war and after war.

And he started his career

as a very promising Georgian writer writing in Georgian.

So he's not doing that

for some personal affinity

or cultural intellectual roots within

Russian nation or Russian people.

# Chapter 12

which happens to be Russian.

Stalin is a big promoter of some form

of Russian nationalism, especially

during the war and after war.

And he started his career

as a very promising Georgian writer writing in Georgian.

So he's not doing that

for some personal affinity

or cultural intellectual roots within

Russian nation or Russian people.

He is doing that for the sake of the success

of his Soviet and communist project.

And he has to get the largest ethnic group on board,

which are Russians.

But Stalin and Putin

have different understanding who Russians are.

Stalin already accepted Ukrainians and Belorussians,

they existed.

Putin goes back to pre-Stalin times.

- So if we step back from

the historical context of this

and maybe the geopolitical purpose of writing such an essay

and forget about the essay altogether.

You know, I have family in Ukraine

and Russia, I know a lot of people in Ukraine

and Russia, forget the war, forget all of this.

There's a kind of, they all kind of sound the same.

Like if I go to France, they sound different

then in Ukraine and Russia.

Like if you lay out this the cultural map

of the world, there's just a different beat and music

and flavor to a people.

I guess what I'm trying to say is there seems

to be a closeness between the cultures of Ukraine or Russia.

Like how do we describe that?

Do we acknowledge that

and how does that add tension

with the national independence?

- First of all, especially when it comes to Eastern Ukraine

or to big cities,

many people in Ukraine spoke Russian, right?

Generally it's the same language, on the top of that

we started our discussion

with talking about the Slavs, right?

So both Ukrainian and Russian language are Slavic languages.

So there is proximity there as well.

On the top of that, there is a history of existence in

the Soviet Union and before that

in one empire for a long period of time.

So you see a lot of,

before the war, a lot of Ukrainian singers

and entertainers performing in Russia and vice versa.

And biography of President Zelenskyy certainly one of the,

fits that particular model

as well, that all talks about similarities.

But this similarities also very often obscure

things that became

so important in the course of this war.

And I already mentioned the book titled

by President Kushma of Ukraine,

Ukraine is not Russia.

So that's the argument.

Despite the fact that you think that we are the same,

we behave differently.

And it turned out that they behave differently.

You have (speaks foreign language) in Moscow

and police violence and that's the end of it.

You have the (speaks foreign language) in Ukraine

and you have police violence

and that's the beginning, that's not the end.

History really matters in the way

why sometimes speak people speak in the same language

with different accents, behave very differently.

Russia and Russian identity was formed around the state

and has difficulty imagining itself outside of the state.

And that state happened to be imperial

for most of Russian history.

Ukrainian project came into existence in

revolt against the state.

Ukraine came into existence out of the parts

of different empires,

which means they left different cultural impact on them.

And for Ukrainians to stay together, a theocratic regime,

so far didn't work.

It's like the colonies of the United States.

You you have to find common language.

You have to talk to each other.

And that became part of the Ukrainian political DNA

and that became a huge factor in the war.

And very few people in Ukraine believed

what Vladimir Putin was saying that Russians

and Ukrainians were one and the same people,

but the majority believed that there're certainly close

culturally and historically nations.

And from that point of view, the bombardment

of the Ukrainian cities became such a shock

to the Ukrainians because deep down

they maybe looked at Syria, they looked at Chechnya

and were explaining that through the fact

that there was basically such a big cultural gap

and difference between Russians

and those countries and those nations.

But my understanding at least, most of them

had difficulty imagining the war of that proportion

and that that sort of ferocity

and that sort of war crimes, the bringing

that sort of war crimes and on that level.

- So it's interesting that you say that in the DNA

of Ukraine versus Russia.

So maybe Russia is more

conducive to authoritarian regimes

and Ukraine is more conducive to defining itself

by rebelling against authoritarian regimes

- By rebellion.

Absolutely.

And that was the story pretty much before 1991.

So what you see since 1991

and what you see today is,

I would say new factor,

certainly in Ukrainian modern history,

'cause Ukrainians traditionally were very successful rebels.

The largest peasant army in the civil War in the Russian

Empire was the (speaks foreign language) army

in southern Ukraine.

And one revolt, Kasakh revolts

and other revolts, one after another.

But Ukrainians had historically difficulty actually

maintaining the sort of freedom that they acquired,

had difficulty associating themself with the state.

And what we see, especially in the last two years,

it's a quite phenomenal development in Ukraine when

Ukrainians associate themselves with the state

where Ukrainians see a state not just as a

foreigner, as historically, it was in Ukrainian history,

not just someone who came to take,

but the state that is continuation of them, that helps

to provide security for them.

That the Ukrainian armed forces, even

before the start of this war had

the highest support and popularity in Ukraine.

The state today functions

unbelievably effectively under attacks and missile attacks,

and again, city government and local government.

And we're witnessing when it comes

to Ukraine, we're witnessing a very important historical

development where Ukrainians found their state

for the first time through most of their history

and try to make a transition from successful rebels

to successful managers and state builders.

- Yeah, I talked to John Mearsheimer recently,

there's a lot of people that believe NATO had a big

contribution to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

So what role did NATO play in this full history

from Bucharest in 2008 to today?

- NATO was a big part, certainly

of the Russian justification for the war.

That was the theme that was

up there in the months leading to the aggression.

The truth is that,

and Vladimir Putin went on records saying

that the western leaders were telling him again

and again that there is no chance for Ukraine

to become member of NATO anytime soon.

Russia was very effective back in the year 2008,

in stopping Ukraine

and Georgia on the path of joining NATO.

There was a Bucharest Summit,

at which the US president at that time,

George W Bush was pushing for the membership

and Putin convinced leaders of France

and Germany to block that membership.

And after that membership for Ukraine

and for Georgia, was really removed from the

realistic agenda for NATO.

And that's what the leaders

of the western world in the month leading to the

February, 2022 aggression were trying to convey

to Vladimir Putin.

What he wanted,

there was an ultimatum that really was there to,

not to start negotiations, but really to stop negotiations.

He demanded the withdrawal of NATO to the borders

of the 1997, if I'm not mistaken,

# Chapter 13

realistic agenda for NATO.

And that's what the leaders

of the western world in the month leading to the

February, 2022 aggression were trying to convey

to Vladimir Putin.

What he wanted,

there was an ultimatum that really was there to,

not to start negotiations, but really to stop negotiations.

He demanded the withdrawal of NATO to the borders

of the 1997, if I'm not mistaken,

so completely something that neither leaders would accept

nor the country's members of NATO would accept.

But for me, it's very clear that

that was an excuse, that that was a justification.

And what happened later in the year 2022

and 2023 certainly confirms me in that belief,

Finland joined NATO

and Sweden is on the way to join in NATO.

So Finland joined in NATO, increased

border between Russia and NATO, twofold,

and probably more than that.

So if NATO is the real concern,

it would be probably not completely unreasonable to expect

that if not every single soldier,

but at least half of the Russian army fighting in Ukraine

would be moved to protect the new border

with NATO in Finland.

So I have no doubt that no one in Kremlin,

either in the past or today looks favorably

or is excited about

NATO moving or the countries of Eastern Europe joining NATO.

But I have very difficult time imagining that

that was the primary cause of the war.

And what we see also, we talked about Tucker's interview,

he was surprised,

but he believed that Putin was completely

honest when the first 25 minutes of interview,

he was talking about relations between Russia and Ukraine.

He was talking about history

and that was also the main focus of his essay.

Essay was not on NATO and Russia,

his essay was on Russia and Ukraine.

So that is where the real causes are.

The broader context is the fall of empire

and process of disintegration of empire,

not the story of NATO.

- What was, to clarify the reason Putin,

Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022?

- The immediate goal in 2014 when the war started

was to stop the drift of Ukraine toward the West

and outside of the Russian sphere of influence,

the invasion of 2022 perceived the same goals

keeping Ukraine in the Russian sphere of influence.

Once we have the resistance,

quite effective resistance on the part of Ukraine, the

Ramstein and international Coalition in support

of Ukraine, then we see the realization of plan B

where parts of Ukrainian territory are being annexed

and included in the Constitution of the Russian Federation.

So the two scenarios don't exclude each other,

but if scenario number one doesn't work,

then scenario number two goes into play.

- In the gates of Kyiv chapter,

you write about Volodymyr Zelenskyy

in the early days of the war.

What are most important moments to you about this time?

The first hours and days of the invasion.

- The first hours and the first days were the

most difficult psychologically, the rest

of the world really didn't expect Kyiv to last

for more than few days.

Didn't expect Ukraine to last for more than few weeks.

And all the data suggested that that's what would happen.

Ukraine would collapse, be taken over.

Putin called his war a special military operation,

which suggests you also expectations about the scope,

expectations about the time.

So semi-military, semi-police operation.

So every reasonable person in the world believed that

that would would happen.

And it's the heroism of quote unquote unreasonable people

like Zelenskyy, like the commander

of Ukrainian armed forces like Zaluzhnyi,

mayors of the cities, (speaks foreign language)

and others, I'm just naming names that are familiar

to almost all of us now.

But there are thousands of those people, unreasonable people

who decided that it was unreasonable

to attack their country.

And that was the most difficult times and days.

And speaking about Zelenskyy, every

I understand reasonable leader in the West was trying

to convince him to leave Ukraine

and to set a government in exile in Poland or in London.

And it was reasonable to accept his,

one of his predecessors, Mr. Yanukovych fled Kyiv.

A few months before that in Afghanistan,

the president of Afghanistan

fled Afghanistan.

That was a reasonable thing to expect.

And he turned out to be very,

very unreasonable in that sense, that comes

with the guts, his guts and guts people around him

and Ukrainians in general.

- Why do you think he stayed in Kyiv, this former comedian

who played a president on TV,

when Kyiv is being invaded by the second most powerful

military in the world?

- Because I think he believes in things

and one of of those things was that if he

president and he's in the presidential office,

he's there to play his role to the end.

And another thing, my personal, again,

I never met Zelenskyy.

My personal understanding of him is that

he has talent that helped him in his career

before the presidency and then helps now.

He feels the audience

and then channel the attitude of the audience

and amplifies it.

And I think that another reason why he didn't leave Kyiv

was that he felt the audience,

the audience in that particular context were the Ukrainians.

- So he had a sense that the Ukrainians would unify

because he was quite, if you look at the polls

before the war, quite unpopular

and there was still divisions and factions,

and the government is divided.

I mean, there's the east and the west

and all this kind of stuff.

You think he had a sense

that this could unite people?

- The east and the west was not already such an issue

after Crimea and part of Donbas being gone.

So Ukraine was much more united than it was before.

He brought to power his

before that really non-existent party of regions

on his personal popularity.

But the important thing is that he created

a majority in the parliament,

which really reflected the unity that existed

among Ukrainians that didn't, was not there

before, he won with 73% of the population

of those who took part in the elections.

His predecessor Petro Oleksiyovych also carried

90% of the precincts.

And the same happened with Zelenskyy.

So the country unified

after 2014 to a degree it was impossible

to imagine before.

And Zelenskyy felt that, Zelenskyy knew that.

And that's where the talent of politician really matters.

And that that's something that you can see

beyond just data.

And you can feel that.

Apparently Yeltsin had that ability.

- Why did the peace talks fail?

There was a lot of peace talks.

- Well, the main reason is that the conditions that

Russia was trying to impose on Ukraine were basically

unacceptable for Ukraine

because one of the conditions

apart from this strange thing called denazification,

was of course de facto loss of the territory.

And for the future really staying

outside either of NATO

or any western support, which was very clear.

You can buy a couple of weeks, you can buy a couple

of months, but in the conditions like that,

Russia will come back tomorrow

and will take over everything.

And once Ukrainians realized

that they can win on the battlefield,

once the Russians were defeated

and withdrew from Kyiv,

the opportunity emerged to get out

# Chapter 14

or any western support, which was very clear.

You can buy a couple of weeks, you can buy a couple

of months, but in the conditions like that,

Russia will come back tomorrow

and will take over everything.

And once Ukrainians realized

that they can win on the battlefield,

once the Russians were defeated

and withdrew from Kyiv,

the opportunity emerged to get out

of the negotiations, which was very clear, were leading

if not today, then tomorrow

to the complete destruction of Ukraine.

And then of course, once the territories started

to be liberated, things like butcher

and massacres of the civilian population came to the fore,

which made also quite difficult, if not impossible,

to conduct negotiations from this moral

and emotional point of view.

- What about the claims that, you know,

Boris Johnson, the West, compromised the ability

of these peace talks to be successful, basically kind

of manipulated the talks?

- I asked people who accompanied Boris Johnson

to give that question.

The answer was no.

And I believe this answer, and I'll tell you why,

because it is very difficult for me to imagine

President Zelenskyy to take orders

from anybody in the world, either Boris Johnson

or Joe Biden or anybody else.

And basically doing things that

Zelenskyy believes are not in his interest

or in the interest of his country.

I just can't imagine that anybody in the world

telling Zelenskyy what to do

and Zelenskyy actually following it against

his own wishes and desires, at least if

that is possible, what is in the public sphere

doesn't allow us to suggest that it is.

- That said, Zelenskyy is a smart man

and he knows that the war can only continue

with the west support.

- That is a different supposition to know

that it can continue with the West support.

But if we're talking about withdrawing from the

negotiations, that's not about the continuation

of the war, for that you don't need Western support.

- Well, what I mean is if he started to sense

that the West will support no matter what,

then maybe the space

of decisions you're making is different.

- We can interpret that that way.

But Boris Johnson represented

at that point, Britain, not the United States,

and really what the war showed,

and it was clear already at that time that

what was needed was massive support

from the West as a whole.

And the promise of that support came only

when the West realized that Ukraine can win,

and came only in late April with the Ramstein.

So at least a few weeks later.

So I dunno how much Boris Johnson could promise,

he probably could promise to try to help

and try to convince

and try to work on that

if Zelenskyy acted on that promise.

He certainly was taking a risk.

But the key issue, again, I'm going back where I started

it's principle, an acceptance for Ukraine, the conditions

that were offered and Ukraine was,

the moment they saw the possibility

that they could fight back with Johnson support,

without Johnson support, they took the chance.

- So what are the ways this war can end, do you think?

What are the different possible trajectories,

whether it's peace talks,

what does winning look like for either side?

What is the role of US?

What trajectories do you see that are possible?

- It's a question on one level, very easy

to answer on the other very difficult,

the level on which it is very easy.

It's a broad historical perspective.

If you really believe,

and I believe in that, that this is the war

of the Soviet succession.

That this is the war of the disintegration of empire.

We know how the story ends

and they end with disintegration of empire.

They end with the rise of the new states

and appearance of the new colored spots on the map.

That's the story that started with the American revolution.

So that's long term perspective.

The difficult part is of course what will happen tomorrow.

The difficult part is what they'll be

in two days and or even in two years.

And in very broad terms,

the war can end in one of three scenarios.

The victory of one side, the victory of another side,

and a sort of a stalemate

and compromise, especially when it comes,

when it comes to the territories.

This war is already approaching the

end of the second year.

I follow the news and look analysis.

I don't remember once single piece suggesting

that the next year will bring peace

or will bring peace for sure.

And we are in a situation where

the both sides still believe

that they can achieve something

or improve their position on the battlefield.

Certainly that was the expectations

of Ukrainian side back in the summer

and early fall of 2023.

And from what I understand now,

this is certainly the expectations

of the Russian side today.

This is the largest war in Europe since World War II,

the largest war in the world since Korean War.

And we know that the Korean War ended in this

division of Korea.

But the negotiations were going on for more than two years.

While those negotiations were going on,

both sides were trying to improve their position there.

And until there was a political change, death of Stalin,

rival of Eisenhower in the United States,

and the realization that the chances

of succeeding on the battlefield are huge,

the peace talks didn't come.

So at this point, all three scenarios are possible.

I don't really discount any of them.

It's early to say what will happen.

- So without any political change, let's try to imagine

what are the possibilities that the war ends this year?

Is it possible that it can end with compromise,

basically at the place it started?

- Meaning back to the borders of 2022?

- Yeah.

Back to the borders of '22

with some security guarantees that aren't really guarantees,

but are hopeful guarantees.

- No, it's not just virtual impossibility.

It's impossible without political change in Moscow.

The reason is that back in the fall of 2022,

Vladimir Putin included five of Ukrainian region sublists,

even those that he didn't control

or didn't control fully into the Russian constitution,

which basically in simple language is

that the hands are tied up not only for Putin himself,

but also for his possible successors.

So that's means that no return to the borders

of 2022 without change,

political change in Moscow are possible.

A few days after that decision in Moscow, Zelenskyy

issued a decree saying that no negotiations with Russia.

What that really meant in plain language is

that basically we're not prepared

to negotiate a stable agreement with five obstacles,

not just the next, but also included into

the Russian constitution.

So that's where we are.

So that scenario is again,

everything is possible of course,

but it's highly, highly unlikely.

- So the Russian constitution is a thing that's very,

that makes this all very difficult.

- Yes.

And not only as a negotiation tactic for Putin

or whoever would negotiate on the Russian side,

but also as a legal issue.

- So like the practical aspect of it even is difficult.

- Yes, you really have to change the constitution

before the peace agreement takes hold

or immediately after that.

And with the Minsk agreements, that was one of things that

Russia wanted from Ukraine, change of the Constitution,

and it turned out to be really impossible.

So that's one of the backstories

of the Minsk and collapse of the Minsk agreements.

- Is there something like Minsk agreements

that are possible now to, maybe this is a legal question,

but to override the constitution to sort of

shake everything up.

So see the constitutional amendment

as just a negotiation tactic to come to the table,

to something like Minsk agreement.

- Given how how fast those those amendments

to the constitution were adopted, that suggests

that real executive power

in Russia has enormous power over

# Chapter 15

that are possible now to, maybe this is a legal question,

but to override the constitution to sort of

shake everything up.

So see the constitutional amendment

as just a negotiation tactic to come to the table,

to something like Minsk agreement.

- Given how how fast those those amendments

to the constitution were adopted, that suggests

that real executive power

in Russia has enormous power over

the legislative branch.

So it's, again, difficult to imagine,

but technically this is possible again.

Yeah, but possible,

if there is a political change in Moscow,

- I don't understand why assuming political change in Moscow

is not possible this year.

So I'm trying to see if there's a way

to end this war this year, right?

- There is a possibility of armistice, right?

But armistice more along,

like any armistice, along the lines

of the current front lines,

but withdrawal of the Russian troops to the borders

or 2022 at this point, whether it's reasonable

or unreasonable can be achieved only as the result

of the defeat of the Russian army.

Like it happened near Kiev.

Is it possible?

Possible.

Is it likely, especially given what is happening

with the Western support, military support for Ukraine?

Probably not.

- But if Putin, the executive branch has a lot of power,

why can't the United States president,

the Russian president, the Ukrainian president, come

to the table and draw up something like the Minsk agreements

where, and then rapid constitutional changes made,

and you go back to the borders in 2022,

before 2022, like through agreements,

through compromise, impossible for you.

- Certainly not this year.

I look at this year as the time when

at least one side, Russian side, will try to get as much

as it can through military means.

- But that's been happening last year too.

Has been a counteroffensive, there's been attempts-

- That doesn't mean

that New Year somehow is supposed to bring your tactics

that the last year was pretty much

a lot of fight and a lot of suffering.

Very little movement of the frontline.

The biggest change

of the last year was Ukraine victory

on the Black Sea, where they pushed

the Russian Navy into the western part of the pond

and restored the grain corridor

and export from Odessa apparently up to 75% of

what it used to be before the war.

So that's the only major change.

But again the price is enormous in terms of

wealth, in terms of, especially in terms of lives.

- So thinking about what 2024 brings,

Zelenskyy just fired Ukraine's head of the Army,

a man you've mentioned, general Valeri Zaluzhnyi.

What do you make of this development?

- This is a very,

very dangerous moment in the war.

The reason for that is that Zaluzhnyi is someone

who is very popular with the army

and with people in general.

So if you look at that through American prism,

that would be something analogous

to President Truman firing General MacArthur,

given that stakes for US at that time, were very high,

but probably not as high as they're for Ukraine today.

In both cases,

what is at stake is certainly the idea

that the political leadership

and military leadership have to be on the same page.

And the question is whether on the part of Zelenskyy,

this is just the change of the leadership

or this is also the change of his approach to the war.

And then can mean many things.

One can mean him taking more active part in

planning operations.

It can mean also possible change of the tactic in the war,

given that counter offensive didn't work out.

We don't know yet.

I don't know whether the president Zelenskyy

at this point knows exactly what will come next.

But this is the time when the change

of the leadership in the country

and in the army that is at war.

It's one of the most trying,

most dangerous moments.

- So the thing that President Zelenskyy expressed is

that this is gonna be a change of tactics,

making the approach more

technologically advanced, this kind of things.

But as you said, I believe

he is less popular than the chief of the Army, Zaluzhnyi,

80% to 60%, depending on the polls.

Do you think it's possible

that Zelenskyy days are numbered as the president?

That somebody like Zaluzhnyi comes to power?

- What we know is that in this war,

Ukrainian people really united

around their president

and the armed forces were always, even

before the start of the war,

more popular than was the presidential office.

So the change, if happened in that realm

was not so dramatic.

And from what I can see from social media in Ukraine,

there is a lot of unhappiness, a lot of questions.

But there is also realization

and very strong realization that country has to stay united.

And certainly the behavior of Zaluzhnyi himself

is there basically not suggesting any sort

of a pre-Georgian type of scenario.

That gives me some hope, actually a lot of hope.

And in terms of whether Zelenskyy's days are numbered

or not, I don't think they're numbered.

But if Ukraine stays a democracy

and I believe it'll stay, the what comes to my mind

is the story of Churchill,

the story of De Gaulle,

in Poland, the story of Pilsudski,

so once the war is over, really the electorate

in the democratic elections, they wanna change the

political leadership, they wanna move forward.

But Pilsudski came back to power

and De Gaulle came back to power,

and Churchill came back to power.

So, no, whatever happens in the short run

or medium term run, I think that

Zelenskyy days in politics are not numbered.

- So what to you is interesting,

for example, if I get a chance to interview Zelenskyy,

what to you is interesting about the person

that would be good to ask about, to explore about

the state of his mind, his thinking his view of the world

as it stands today?

- Next month were supposed to take place

Ukrainian elections, they're not taking place

because the majority of Ukrainians don't think this is

the right thing to do, to change the president,

to have the elections

to have a political struggle in the middle of the war.

So Zelenskyy refused to call those elections

despite the fact that he is

and continues to be the most popular politician in Ukraine.

So it would be to his benefit.

But that's clearly not

what the Ukrainians want.

But the question of continuing as the president

beyond five years, also one way

or another would raise questions about the legitimacy

and certainly Russia will be playing this card

like there is no tomorrow.

And what I would be interested in asking Zelenskyy about,

whether he sees that his second term,

which comes on those conditions

would suggest different attitudes towards the opposition,

maybe some form of the

coalition government, like it was the case in Britain

with Churchill under different circumstances of course.

Or this is basically, in his opinion, something

that would be destructive

and something that would really be an impediment

for the issue, for the question of unity and war effort.

And I would ask this question, not

to basically suggest that that's the way to go,

but I would be very much interested to hear

what is his thinking about that is.

- Do you think there's a degree during war time

that the power that comes

with being a war president can corrupt the person, sort of

push you away from the democratic mindset

towards an authoritarian one?

- I think that there is a possibility of that, right?

You, in the conditions of

any emergency, war in the case of the Soviet Union,

there was a Chernobyl disaster and so on and so forth.

You make decisions much faster.

You create this vertical and then it's very easy to get

# Chapter 16

that the power that comes

with being a war president can corrupt the person, sort of

push you away from the democratic mindset

towards an authoritarian one?

- I think that there is a possibility of that, right?

You, in the conditions of

any emergency, war in the case of the Soviet Union,

there was a Chernobyl disaster and so on and so forth.

You make decisions much faster.

You create this vertical and then it's very easy to get

really used to that way, dealing with the issues

in the conditions of emergency, right?

And then they continue emergency (laughs)

or with no emergency, they're continuing the emergency mode.

I think again that that would be a very,

very natural thing for any human being to do,

to make it easier.

Should I do that easier and in more effective way,

or should I do the right way?

That's a challenge.

Sometimes it's difficult to answer this question.

- Lemme stay in power for just a little longer

to do it the efficient way and then time flies away

and all of a sudden you're going for the third term.

And the fourth term.

- And suddenly it's easy to realize

that actually you can't rule in any other way.

You just, whatever skills you had of people

around that can help, is that already gone?

- Exactly.

The people that surround you are not

providing the kind of critical feedback necessary

for a democratic system.

One of the things that Tucker said

after his interview with Putin,

he was just in this hotel just chatting on video,

and he said that he felt like

Putin was not very good at explaining himself,

like a coherent whole narrative

of why the invasion happened.

It's just this big picture.

And he said that's not because he doesn't have one,

but it's been a long time since he's had somebody

around him who he has to explain himself to.

So he's out of practice, which is very interesting.

It's a very interesting point.

And that's what war

and being in power for a prolonged period of time can do.

So on that topic, if you had a chance to talk to Putin,

what kind of questions would you ask him?

What would you like to find out about the

man as he stands today?

- As a historian, I have a lot of questions

and I have questions about when the decision was made

to attack Ukraine and what went into this decision

because we're thinking about that.

We're trying.

So as a historian, I have this big question.

I have question about the Crimea when those decisions

were made.

So that sort of questions, that interest me,

but the rest either I think that I understand

what is going on with him

or I don't expect the answer that can help, for example,

a good question, whether you regret

or not, the start of the war in 2022,

given the enormous, enormous casualties on both sides.

But you can't expect from a politician

an honest answer to this question.

Right?

So there are questions to which I know he can't

answer honestly,

and then there are other questions

to which I think he already

provided all answers that he could.

So what what for me is

of interest are basically questions for a historian

about the timing

and the logic of particular decisions.

- Well, I do wonder how different

what he says publicly is from what he thinks privately.

So a question about when the decision

to invade Ukraine happens is a very good question

to give insight to the difference between

how he thinks about the world privately versus

what he says publicly.

And same about other, you know, about empire, as if you ask

Putin, he will say he has no interest in empire

and he finds the notion silly,

but at the same time,

perhaps privately there's a sense in which he does

seek the reunification of the Russian empire.

- Not in the form of the Russian Empire, not in the form

of the Soviet Union, but certainly in some

form of the Russian control.

That's for me at least, it's quite clear.

Otherwise there would be no

busts to the Russian emperors and Katherine

and Peter and others.

- You wrote in your book titled The Frontline,

Essays on Ukraine's Past and Present,

about the Russian question,

I guess articulated by Solzhenitsyn

first in 1994.

Solzhenitsyn of course is the author of Gulag Archipelago.

He's half Ukrainian.

What is the Russian question?

- Solzhenitsyn clearly identifies himself as a Russian,

and his opposition to the communist regime

was a position of a Russian nationalist.

So his argument was that communism was bad for Russia

and for him, Russian question is about the

Russians, ethnic Russians,

but also he was thinking about Russians

in Putin's terms,

or Putin thinks in Solzhenitsyn's terms about Ukrainians

and Belarusians constituting part of that.

So the Russian question is the biggest tragedy

of the 20th century, the division of the Russians,

the loss of the statehood

and division of the Russians

between different states.

This is for Solzhenitsyn, Russian question.

And his original idea

and plan was presented in the essay

that he published in 1990,

which was called How we Should Restructure Russia,

and restructure Russia meant getting rid of the Baltics,

central Asia and Caucasus and have Russians, Ukrainians

and Belarusians, including those

who live in northern Kazakhstan to create one nation state.

So he was a Russian nationalist,

but he was thinking about Russian nation state as the state

of Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians.

And once the Soviet Union collapsed,

and his idea was not implemented in the 1990s,

he formulated plan B, taken over by Russia

of Donbas, Crimea and Southern Ukraine, the areas

that now are included in the Russian Constitution.

So in historical terms

and intellectual terms, what is happening today

in the war between Russia

and Ukraine is the vision

on one level or another level that was formulated

by the noble laureate, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn

half Russian, half Ukrainian.

- If there is such a thing,

what would you say is the Ukrainian

question as we stand today?

- The Ukrainian question is very simple.

It's now, it's not anymore acquisition of the nation state,

but actually a sovereign state.

But it's maintenance.

So the Ukrainian question is like dozens

of other questions in the 20th

and 21st century, the rise of the new state.

And that's what is the Ukrainian question,

whether, whether Ukraine will continue to its existence

as a nation, as an independent state

because that existence is being questioned

by stating that Russians and Ukrainians so on,

and the same people which de facto saying Ukraine is Russian

and also trying to to destroy the state.

- Is it possible that if the war in Ukraine continues

for many more years, that the next leader

that follows Zelenskyy would

take Ukraine away from a sort

of democratic western style nation

towards a more authoritarian one, maybe even

with a far right influence, this kind of direction

because of the war, the influence of war?

- Everything is possible

and the longer the war continues,

the more likely scenario like that becomes,

but realization of that scenario

would go against the grain of largest part

of Ukrainian history.

Where Ukraine really emerged

as a pluralistic state on which the elements of democracy

were built in the last 30 years would go against the grain

of the Ukrainian society.

Where as one author formulated in the 1990s,

he wrote a book, Ukrainian Nationalism a Minority Faith,

where the nationalism was a minority faith

and radical nationalism continues

to be, or at least continue to be in 2019, a minority faith

during the last elections.

So possible,

but unlikely given the historical realities of the last

30 plus years.

- I could talk to you for many more hours (laughs)

on Chernobyl alone since you've written a book on

Chernobyl and nuclear disaster.

There's just a million possible conversations here.

# Chapter 17

and radical nationalism continues

to be, or at least continue to be in 2019, a minority faith

during the last elections.

So possible,

but unlikely given the historical realities of the last

30 plus years.

- I could talk to you for many more hours (laughs)

on Chernobyl alone since you've written a book on

Chernobyl and nuclear disaster.

There's just a million possible conversations here.

But let me just jump around history a little bit.

Back before World War II, my grandmother lived

through Holodomor in World War II, Nazi occupied

Ukraine, Holodomor, what do you learn,

let's say about human nature and about governments

and nations from the fact that Holodomor happened,

and maybe you could say what it is and why it happened.

- Holodomor is a massive famine in Ukraine

between the years 1932 and 1934.

And it happened as the result

of forceful collectivization of the agriculture

and a tamp on the part of Stalin also

really roll Ukraine into the Soviet Union with

basically no potential opposition from Ukraine,

now national communists.

So two things came together in December

of 1932 when in the same decree, Stalin

and Molotov signed a decree on the requisition of the grain,

which lead eventually to the mass starvation

and on the banning of Ukrainian language publications

and education out in other Soviet republics outside

of Ukraine and introducing limitations on

the so-called Ukrainization policies.

So on the use of Ukrainian language in Ukraine itself.

And the numbers are debated.

The numbers that most

of the scholars work today are 4 million.

But again, there are larger numbers as well

that circulate.

And this is, the famine

of '32, '33 was not exclusive Ukrainian phenomenon,

but most of Ukrainians in the Soviet Union died in Ukraine.

And Ukraine was the only place

where the policy on collecting grain were coming together

with the policy of the cleansing

of the political leadership sending people from Moscow

to take over the leadership and attack on Ukrainian culture.

So in terms of what I learn about human nature,

it's more me learning about

the ideologists of the 20th century

because it's not the only famine in the communist lands,

the famine in China, which was in terms of the numbers,

much more devastating than that.

It's in a different category and for a good reason,

but you have holocaust.

What unites these things is the time, this is 20 century,

what unites them are the dominance in the societies

that are doing that, really ideologists

that not just devalued human life,

but considered that actually the way forward is

by destroying large group of populations defined ethnically,

religiously, socially or otherwise,

which tells about the time,

but tells also about humanity because for centuries

before that human life was valued, there were enemies,

but the idea was that human life can put

and you can, at the end of the day, they can be slaves,

you can use them for productive force.

Countries in the 18th century with southern Ukraine,

they will looking for settlers, for people to bring

and live on land.

You move into the 20th century

and there is mass destruction of the population in the name

of ideologies, which basically are

by definition destroy human lives.

And that's what really so shocking and striking

because that's break with not just with issues

of morale, not just with issues of humanity,

with any common sense, what is happening.

And I'm absolutely convinced

that we didn't learn the lesson.

I'm absolutely convinced that we didn't learn the lesson

with turning our page on fascism and communism,

we somehow decided that we're free of that,

that at least in those terms, history came to an end.

That what is ahead is in future, nothing of that sort,

what happened would take place to a degree

that people would get in trouble

for comparing any statements

or events that are happening today with

either the communism of fascism.

And so I feel responsibility of myself

and as a historian in particular for

not doing a better job about telling people

that well, we are who we are

and we have as humans our dark side

and we have to be very careful.

- So there is a human capacity to be captured

by an idea, an ideology that claims

to bring up a better world as the Nazis did,

as Soviet Union did.

And on the path of doing that devaluing human life

that we will bring a better world.

And if millions of people have

to be tortured on the way to that, all right,

but at least we have a better world

and human beings are able to,

if not accept that, look the other way.

- Yes.

So, and in the name of a particular nation

or race, like, like with the Third Reich

or in in the name of the humanity of the future,

so not just devalue, human life destroy human life.

- Is there something fundamental about communism

and centralized planning

that's part of the problem here?

Maybe this also connects to just story of Chernobyl, where

that Chernobyl disaster is not just a story of failure

of a nuclear power plant,

but it's an entire institution

of the scientific and nuclear institution.

But the entirety of the government.

- There is, and there is a number of factors of political

and social character that produced Chernobyl.

And one of them is generally the

atmosphere of secrecy in the Soviet Union.

In the conditions of the Cold War,

Chernobyl reactor was a dual purpose reactor.

It could boil water today

and produce enriched uranium tomorrow, right?

So it was top secret.

And if there were problems with that reactor,

those problems were kept secret even at people who operated.

That's what happened.

That's what happened in Chernobyl.

Another big, big part of the story, which is

specifically Soviet, that's the nature

of the managerial culture

and administrative culture in which people had no right

to make their own decisions

in their place, in their position.

A few years before that, Three Mile Island happened,

which was a big, big nuclear disaster.

But in terms of consequences,

nothing like Chernobyl.

And there in the context of the American legal culture

and managerial culture, people who were

operators who were in managerial positions,

that was their responsibility to take decisions.

President Carter came there,

but he was not calling shots on none of those issues.

What you see with Chernobyl,

and people who saw HBO serious know that very well,

the moment the high official arrives,

everyone actually falls in line,

is the official who calls the shot.

And to move population from the city of Pripyat,

you needed the okay coming from Moscow,

from the very top.

So that is Soviet story

and there is a global story of cutting corners

to meet either deadlines like it was with that test

that they were running at that time

or to meet production quarters.

This is not just socialist thing, you can

replace production quarters with

profit and you get the same story.

So some parts of in that story are generally

reflective of our, today's world in general.

Others are very specific for Soviet Union,

for Soviet experience.

And then the biggest probably Soviet

part of that story is that on the one hand,

the government in Moscow

and Kyiv, they mobilize all resources to deal with that,

# Chapter 18

replace production quarters with

profit and you get the same story.

So some parts of in that story are generally

reflective of our, today's world in general.

Others are very specific for Soviet Union,

for Soviet experience.

And then the biggest probably Soviet

part of that story is that on the one hand,

the government in Moscow

and Kyiv, they mobilize all resources to deal with that,

but they keep information about what is happening

and the radiation clouds secret

from the rest of the population, something

that completely would be impossible

and was impossible in US, in UK

where other accidents happened.

And then guess what?

A few years later

the Soviet Union collapses very much also thanks

to the mobilization of people over the issue of Chernobyl

and nuclear energy, and people

writing about that subject call it eco-nationalism,

ecological nationalism, which comes at least in part from

withholding information from people.

And in Ukraine, mobilization didn't start over

the issues that led to independence,

didn't start over the issue of language

or didn't start over the issue of national autonomy.

It started under the slogans,

"Tell us the truth about Chernobyl."

We wanna know whether we live in contaminated areas or not.

And that was a very, very strong factor

that crossed the,

not just ethnic religious linguistic lines,

lines between members of the party

or not members of the party

of the top leadership and not, and military and civilian,

because it turned out

that the party car didn't protect you from being affected

by radiation.

So the all national mobilization happens,

the first mass manifestations are about Chernobyl,

not about anything else.

- That's fascinating.

I mean, for people

who might not know, Chernobyl is located in Ukraine.

So it would be, it's a fascinating view

that Chernobyl might be one of the critical sort

of threshold catalysts for the collapse of the Soviet Union.

That's very interesting.

Well, just as a small aside,

I guess this is a good moment to give some love

to the HBO series.

It made me, even though it's British accents

and so on, it made me realize that some

of these stories in Eastern Europe could be told very

effectively through film, through series.

It was quite a, I mean it was so incredibly well done

and it maybe I can ask you historically

speaking, were you impressed?

- I was, I was.

And I think that the miniseries, very truthful

on a number of levels

and very untruthful on some others.

(Lex laughs)

And they got excellent in a very well,

the macro and micro levels.

So the macro level is the issue of the big truth.

And the story there is very much built

around the theme that I just discussed.

Now it's about the cost of lies, right?

And the Soviet Union line to the people.

And that's what the film explores.

So I call it a big truth about Chernobyl.

And they got a lot of

minor things really, really very well.

Like the curtains on the windows, like

how the houses looked from inside and outside.

I didn't see any post-Soviet film

or any western film that would be

so good at captioning those everyday details.

But then there is a huge gray area (laughs)

in between big truth and small truth

is of the recreating the environment.

And that's how you get from one to another.

And then you see the KGB officers coming

and taking someone out of the meeting

and arresting, which was not necessary.

You see the Soviet boss threatening someone

to throw the person from the helicopter.

So you get this Hollywood sort of things despite the fact

that it's HBO series

and they're the best really in terms

as a film in the fourth episode

where they can completely decided just, to hell

with the reality (laughs) and let's make a film.

So they bring Legasov one of the key characters to the

this court meetings that they bring.

The key Soviet party, Boris Shcherbina, he wasn't there.

They created drama there.

So, but so they got the main thing, the big truth right.

And that's why I like this production.

- Sometimes you have to show

what something felt like, you have

to go bigger than it actually was.

I mean, if you, I don't know, if you experience heartbreak

and you want, and you see a film about it,

you want there to be explosions.

- You want to see this in images, visible, right?

So, but the question again,

I just mentioned KGB marching in

and so some party leader giving a speech,

they were not giving that speech, but the sense was there

and it was in the air.

And I, as people of my generation who were there, knew that

and recognized that,

but for new generation, whether they are in Ukraine

and Russia, in US, in Britain, in Zimbabwe, anywhere,

yeah, you have to do

this little and truth and introduce them and,

had a very interesting on air conversation

with the author of the script.

Amazing.

And I asked him the question of, okay,

the film declared really the importance of the truth,

but how do you square that with, yeah,

(both laugh)

with the need in the film to really put it mildly

to go beyond the measures of truth,

whatever understanding of that term is?

- Well, I suppose it is a bit terrifying that some

of the most dramatic moments in history are

probably quite mundane.

The decisions to begin wars, invasions,

they're probably something like a Zoom meeting

on a random Tuesday in today's workplace.

So it's not like there's dramatic music playing.

These are just human decisions and they command armies

and they command destruction.

I personally,

because of that, believe in the power of individuals

to be able to stop wars,

not just start wars, individual leaders.

So lemme just ask about nuclear safety

because there's an interesting point you make.

You wrote in the book, in Atoms and Ashes,

a Global History of Nuclear Disaster.

So technically nuclear energy is extremely safe.

There's a number of people died per energy generated,

it's much safer than coal and oil,

for example, as far as I understand.

But the case you also make is you write quote,

"Many of the political, economic, social

and cultural factors that led to the accidents of the past

are still with us today,

making the nuclear industry vulnerable

to repeating old mistakes in new and unexpected ways,

and any new accidents are certain

to create new anti-nuclear mobilization.

And then you continue with,

this makes the nuclear industry not only risky

to operate, but also impossible to count on

as a long-term solution to an overwhelming problem.

So can you explain that perspective?

It's an interesting one, sort of speaking to the psychology

of when an accident does happen, it has a dramatic effect.

And also speaking to the fact

that accidents can happen

not because of the safety of the nuclear power plant,

but of the underlying structure

of government that oversees it.

- Yes, I wrote book on Chernobyl

and then tried to understand Chernobyl better,

but place in it in the context of other disasters

as a historian and was looking at the political factors

and social factors and cultural factors,

not the physics or engineering part of the story.

And the factors that are still with us

are like it was the case in Chernobyl

the authoritarian regimes, right?

And high centralization of the decision making

and desire to cut corners

and also the issues associated with secrecy.

So that is with us.

If you look at where the future

of the nuclear industry is now at this point,

it's the regimes and parts in the Middle East.

That's a big new frontier.

The countries that are not particularly known

for the history of democratic existence,

where we also have the situation

that we had at Three Mile Island that we had

at Chernobyl.

This is the first generation engineers,

nuclear engineers, right?

So people who are, where the

# Chapter 19

it's the regimes and parts in the Middle East.

That's a big new frontier.

The countries that are not particularly known

for the history of democratic existence,

where we also have the situation

that we had at Three Mile Island that we had

at Chernobyl.

This is the first generation engineers,

nuclear engineers, right?

So people who are, where the

country doesn't have a lot of experience in generations

after generations working in

that particular industry where it's all new.

That is certainly additional risk.

What we've got now is this current war,

is something that, not that people completely didn't expect,

but didn't happen in the past.

You see the war coming to the nuclear sites,

Chernobyl was taken over by the Russian Army

or National Guard rather on the first day of the invasion.

Then there was Zaporizhzhia,

the largest nuclear power plant in Europe

where the battle was waged on the territory

of the nuclear power plant.

The missiles being fired, buildings catching fire.

And the situation

that brought the Fukushima disaster was there at

Zaporizhzhia more than once, and Fukushima came

because the rectors were shut down

as they are at Zaporizhzhia,

but they still needed electricity to bring water

and to cool them down.

And in Fukushima case, it was the tsunami

that cut off the supply of electricity.

In the case of Zaporizhzhia, there was the war

that was happening in the area around Zaporizhzhia

that did the same effect.

So we have 440 reactors in the world today, plus, minus,

none of them was designed to withstand

the direct missile attack

or to function in the conditions of the warfare.

If operators, they're human,

then they make mistakes like they did at

Three Mile Island or Chernobyl.

But think also if the war is happening around them,

if they're not sure what is happening

with their families, if they don't know whether they will be

next missile, whether we'll hit their room

where they, the control room

or not, that multiplies also.

So we are in a situation where

we are not done yet with

the nuclear accidents, new, each time,

it's not like we don't pay attention or we don't learn.

Smart people work on that.

And after every accident, try to figure the way how not

to step into the same trap.

But next accident would actually

expose a new vulnerability.

You deal with Chernobyl,

and then tsunami comes, you deal with tsunami

and then war comes.

And we really in that sense,

we have sometimes wild imagination,

but sometimes it's difficult to imagine

what can happen next.

So we are not done.

There will be nuclear accidents unfortunately in the future.

And that makes nuclear energy

so problematic when you count on it

to fight climate change.

I'll explain why.

You gave the figures

how many people die from burning coal, from

how many people die from radiation.

And it's a good argument.

Some people would question them

because it's also the issue of not just dying,

but impact of radiation on cancer,

on our health, which is not completely understood yet.

So it's still there, there is a lot of question marks,

but let's assume what you're saying.

That's the figures.

That's how it is, but we as people

we for whatever reason are not afraid of coal,

but we're very much afraid of radiation.

It's invisible.

It's Covid, it's everywhere,

and you can't see it.

And then you start having issues

and then you have problems.

And during the Covid,

the governments closed the borders.

Maybe a good idea, maybe not so good ideas.

Isolation.

So that was the way, governments started to fight

for access to Pfizer, to Moderna,

to Sputnik, to whatever it is, to vaccine.

So now back to the radiation,

what is happening once Chernobyl happens,

that's the highest point in the development

of nuclear industry so far in terms of

how many new reactors were commissioned

or the licenses were issued.

The next reactor after Three Mile Island

in the US go ahead was given, it seems to me 10 years ago

or something like that, the Fukushima happens,

the reaction is in China to that as well.

They're very much concerned.

So there is a saying in the field,

Chernobyl anywhere is Chernobyl everywhere.

After Fukushima, Germany decides to go nuclear free

and gets there at the expense of burning coal.

So that's how we react.

And each major accident, that means global freeze

on the nuclear reactor production

for at least another 10 years.

So that's what I mean that nuclear industry, not just

in terms of technology

and not just in terms of radiation impact on health,

but also politically a very, very unreliable option.

- And to you, you suspect that's an irreparable aspect

of human nature in the human mind

that there's certain things

that just create a kind of panic.

Invisible threats of this kind.

Whether it's a virus or radiation.

There's something about the mind.

If I get a stomach ache in the United States

after Fukushima, I kind of think it's probably radiation,

this kind of irrational type of thinking.

And that's not possible to repair?

- I think we can be trained, right? (laughs)

We can be trained.

- [Lex] Pretty smart, aren't we?

- But generally we're afraid of things that we see,

but even more we're afraid of things that we don't see

and radiation is one of those.

- Let's zoom out on the world.

We talked about the war in Ukraine.

How does the war in Ukraine change the world order?

Lemme just look at everything that's going on.

Zoom out a bit.

China, the Israel/Gaza War, the Middle East, India.

What is interesting to you, important

to think about in the coming years and decades?

- As a historian, and I'm trained that way,

I have a feeling of deja vu.

I see the Cold Wars coming back in many of its features.

And the war started

and we discussed that in 2014,

at least in my interpretation with Russia trying

to really reestablish its control

over the post-Soviet space, and Ukraine

was crucial for that project.

And the more globally Russian vision since 1990s was that

they didn't like the American monopolar world.

They knew and realize that they couldn't go back

to the bipolar world of the Cold War era.

So the vision was multipolar world

in which again, it wasn't just academic exercise,

it was a political exercise in which Russia would be one

of the centers, one of the poles on par with China, on par

with European Union, on par with the United States.

That's very broadly speaking the context

in which the war starts 2014, where we are now,

well we are now in Russia certainly trying

to regain its military strength,

but no one actually believes that Russia is the sort

of a superpower it was imagined before 2022.

We see certainly Russia finding the way

to deal with the sanctions,

but we don't see certainly Russia

as a economic power with any sort of a future.

So it's not an implosion

of the Russian military economic and political power,

but it's significantly actually, it's diminished.

So today, very difficult

to imagine the Russia immersion as another pole

of the multipolar world.

Not impossible, but the war certainly made that

very problematic and much more difficult.

On the other hand, what the war did, it basically

awakened the West, the old West,

United States and Western Europe transatlantic alliance.

And on the top of that,

# Chapter 20

but it's significantly actually, it's diminished.

So today, very difficult

to imagine the Russia immersion as another pole

of the multipolar world.

Not impossible, but the war certainly made that

very problematic and much more difficult.

On the other hand, what the war did, it basically

awakened the West, the old West,

United States and Western Europe transatlantic alliance.

And on the top of that,

there are East European countries that are

even much stronger proponents of assistance

for Ukraine than is Germany or the United States of America.

So it is the replay of the Cold War story,

the return of the West, that one of the chapters in my

book, The Russo-Ukrainian War, is called that way.

We also can see the elements of the rebuilding

of the Beijing-Moscow alliance of the 1950s,

which was a very important part of the Cold War.

It was extremely important part of the Korean War

that in many ways launched also the Cold War globally.

So I see a lot of parallels of going back to the time

of the Cold War and the bipolar world that emerges.

It's not anymore the world focused on Washington and Moscow.

It's more like world focused on Washington and Beijing.

And then there are countries in between,

there are countries in between

that join one block or another block that is emergent,

that is not fully formed.

This is, in my opinion, makes the task

of us historians to really go back

to the Cold War and look for through new perspective

on the history of that conflict.

Because there is a lot of things that we can learn.

- So in some ways history does repeat itself here.

So now it's a cold war with China

and the United States.

What's a hopeful trajectory for the 21st century?

For the rest of it?

- The hopeful trajectory is really trying to be as wise

and as lucky as our predecessors during the Cold War were.

(Lex laughs)

Because the dominant discourse

so far about the Cold War was what a horrible thing

that Cold War was.

What did we do wrong?

How did we end up in the Cold War?

And I think especially today,

this is a wrong question to ask.

The right question to ask is how did it happen?

What did we do so right?

That for now more than 70 years, we don't have a world war?

How come that after World War I,

world War II came within 20 years, how come that,

what helped us to keep the world on the brain,

but still away from the global war for such a long period

of time, how to keep the Cold War cold?

That's the biggest lesson that the history

of the Cold War can give us.

And I don't think we ask the question quite often

enough, ask the question that way.

And if you don't ask right questions,

we don't get right answers.

- Yeah, you've written a book,

a great book on the Cuban Missile Crisis,

and we came very close not

to just another World War, but to, you know, a nuclear war

and the destruction of

human civilization as we know it.

So I guess it's a good question to ask,

what did we do so right?

And maybe one of the answers could be that we just got lucky

and the question is how do we keep getting lucky?

- Luck is clearly, clearly one of the factors in the

Cuban missile crisis because what happened there,

and there is one of the lessons is that eventually

the commanders at the top, they believe

that they have all the cards,

they negotiate with each other.

They try to see who blinks first

in the game of nuclear brinkmanship.

The trick is that they don't control

fully people on the ground.

The most dangerous moment,

or one of the most dangerous moment

of the Cuban missile crisis was the

Soviet missile shooting down the American airplane,

killing the pilot, an act of war, right?

So technically we're already in the war,

and the order to shoot the missile was given

with Moscow having no clue what was going on the ground.

Moscow never gave approval for that.

And again, I described

that in book many times about Kennedy bringing back his

wisdom from World War II years.

There there always will be SOB who didn't get the order

or miss things.

And that was happening on the American side as well.

So people who believe

that they're in control really are not in control,

and that can escalate whether they were

very often against, against their issues.

So that is one lesson,

but going back to why we are still here

and why the world

didn't end up in 1962, is that

the leadership, and that's, I come to the issue

that you strongly believing that people,

personalities matter, leaders matter.

They were very different, right?

Age, education, political careers, understanding

what politics are and so on and so forth.

- You mean Kryuchkov-

- Kryuchkov and Kennedy, yes.

But they had one thing in common that in one way they belong

to the same generation, that was generation

of the beginning of it all.

That was the generation of the hydrogen bomb, the bomb

that unlike the atomic bomb,

they knew could destroy the world.

And they were scared, they were scared

of the nuclear weapons,

and they tried to do whatever they could

pushing against the advisors

or were trying to deal with their anxieties.

The first is true for Kennedy.

Then later maybe for Kryuchkov to make sure

that this, that the war between the United States

and the Soviet Union doesn't start

because they knew that that war

would be a nuclear war.

So we have a very, very paradoxical sort of situation.

The crisis occurred because of the nuclear weapons,

because Kryuchkov put them on Cuba,

but the crisis was resolved

and we didn't end in the third World War

because of the nuclear weapons,

because people,

leaders were afraid of them.

And that's where I wanna put emphasis.

It's not that the nuclear weapons created crisis

or solved the crisis, is basically our perception of them.

And we are now in the age

after the Cold War era is the new generation of voters,

is the new generation of politicians.

We don't belong to the generation of beginning at all.

We may be not what beginning is,

but we think that this is-

- It's a different thing.

- That this is something else.

And it's very important.

- It's so fascinating

how that fades into memory that the power

and the respect and fear of the power

of nuclear weapons just fades into memory

and that we may very well make the same mistakes again.

- Yes, we can.

- (laughs) Another leader said that, I believe,

but about a totally different topic.

Well, like you said, I'm also glad that we're here more

as a civilization that we still seem to be going on.

There's several billion of us

and I'm also glad that the two of us are here.

I've read a lot of your books, I've been recommending it.

Please keep writing.
