# Chapter 1

joe rogan podcast.

 check it out.

 >> the joe rogan experience.

 >> train by day.

 joe rogan podcast by night.

 all day.

 >> exactly.

 >> just every morning.

 >> wonder what jeff bezos is doing.

 >> he's doing some definitely doing some testosterone.

 he looks jacked.

 >> he looks jacked, right?

 >> yeah.

 but he didn't like >> quick >> quick >> quick

 at age like at 50 at age 59

 in less than a year he he went from

 pencilet geek to

 looking like a like the rock.

 >> yeah.

 like a little miniature alpha fella.

 >> yeah.

 like like his neck got bigger than his head.

 >> yeah.

 he got bigger.

 >> but then like his earlier pictures his neck's like a noodle.

 >> i support this activity.

 i like to see him going in this direction >> which is fine.

 and his voice dropped like two octaves.

 i want you to move in that direction as well.

 >> i think we can achieve this.

 >> i i i mean i should >> i think we can achieve >> gigachad.

 that's what people called it.

 >> where is that guy?

 >> bele.

 i don't know where he is.

 >> that's like a real guy.

 >> the artist.

 yeah.

 >> no.

 >> oh, gigachad.

 oh, gigachad.

 yeah.

 i don't know if that's a real guy.

 it's hard to say.

 >> no, it is a real guy.

 >> it is a real guy.

 >> he's got the crazy jaw and like perfect sculpted hair.

 >> yeah.

 well, i mean, they may have exaggerated a little bit, but

 >> um

 >> but

 no, i think i think he actually just kind of looked like that in reality.

 >> wow.

 >> um so >> like like he's a pretty unique looking individual.

 >> i think we can achieve this.

 that guy right there, that's a real guy.

 >> that's a real dude.

 >> i always thought that was cgi.

 >> no, i think one of i think the upper right one is not him.

 that's not >> but that one to the left of that like that's real.

 no, that's that's artificial, bro.

 that's fake.

 that's got that uncanny valley feel to it, doesn't it?

 >> it's it's not impossible.

 >> no, no, it's not impossible to achieve,

 but it's not it's not possible to maintain that kind of leanness.

 i mean, that's like like you're you're also

 at that point they're he's dehydrating

 and all sorts of things.

 >> oh, it's based on a real person.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 based on, >> right, but it's not a real person.

 what does he really look like?

 >> like those images, i think, are [ __ ] >> some of them are.

 is that real?

 okay.

 that that looks real.

 that looks like a really jack bodybuilder.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah, that looks real.

 like that's achievable.

 but there's a few of those

 images

 where you're just like, "what's

 going on here?"

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 totally.

 um >> well, i mean, you see you see

 >> that guy is that is that the >> that's the real dude?

 >> well, there's that that that icelandic dude who's thor.

 >> oh, yeah.

 the guy who jumps in the frozen

 lakes and [ __ ] >> well, the guy who played the mountain.

 um >> oh, that guy.

 >> that is that is like a that that is like a a mutant strong human.

 yes.

 >> like like he would be in like the x-men or something, you know?

 >> he's just like not like

 >> and there's that you know that have you seen that meme tent and tent bag?

 >> um you know how like it's like it's really hard to get the tent

 tent in >> oh, right.

 right.

 >> that's true.

 >> then there's a picture of of him and his girlfriend.

 that's hilarious.

 >> yeah, that's >> i don't know how it gets in there, you know?

 it's like it seems too small.

 but >> i met brian shaw.

 brian shaw is like the world's most powerful man.

 and he's almost 7 feet tall.

 he's 400 lb.

 >> and his his bone density is 1 in 500 million people.

 so there's one it's like there's like maybe 16 people.

 >> he's an enormous human being.

 like a legitimate giant just like that guy.

 but we met him.

 he was hanging out with us in the green room of the mother ship.

 it's like, okay,

 if this was like david and goliath

 days, like

 this is an actual giant like the giants of the bible.

 >> once in a while they get a super giant person.

 >> this is a real a real one.

 like not a tall skinny basketball player, like a 7 foot 400b powerliffter.

 >> like you don't want to especially look at him.

 that's the guy.

 see if there's a photo of him standing next to like a regular human.

 i >> was trying to get >> there it is.

 that's him right there.

 like there's like there's like one of him with

 next to standing next to arnold and stuff and it's where and

 everyone everyone just looks tiny.

 >> i mean i think he's a pretty cool dude actually.

 >> oh, brian's very cool.

 very smart, too.

 unusually, you know, you expect anybody to be that big.

 it's got to be a [ __ ] >> no.

 >> yeah.

 there was there's andre the giant who was awesome.

 you >> he was great in princess bride and >> no, he was just awesome period.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 so, we were talking about

 um this interview

 with

 sam alman

 and tucker, and i was like, we should probably just talk about this on the air

 because it is one of the craziest interviews i think i've ever seen in my life.

 >> yeah.

 >> where tucker starts bringing up this guy who was a whistleblower, whatever.

 >> a whistleblower who, you know, >> committed suicide, but it doesn't look like it.

 >> and and he's talking to sam alman about this.

 and sam alton was like, "are you accusing me?" he's like, "no, no, no.

 i'm not.

 i'm just saying i i think someone killed him.

 >> yeah.

 and like and it should be investigated.

 >> yeah.

 >> um not just drop the case.

 >> it seems like >> they just dropped the case.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 but his parents think he was murdered.

 >> yeah.

 >> um the wires to a security camera were cut.

 um >> blood in two rooms.

 >> blood in two rooms.

 someone else's wig was in the room.

 and >> someone else's wig.

 >> wig.

 >> wig.

 yes.

 not his wig.

 >> not normal to have a wig laying around.

 >> yes.

 um and

 um and he ordered door dash right before allegedly committing suicide.

 >> uh which is it seems unusual, you know?

 >> yeah.

 >> it's like, you know, let's

 i'm going to order pizza on second thoughts,

 i'll kill myself.

 is it seems like that's a very rapid change in mindset.

 >> it's very weird.

 and especially the parents have they they don't believe he committed suicide at all.

 >> has no note or anything.

 >> no.

 >> yeah.

 >> it seems pretty [ __ ] up.

 and you know, the idea that a whistleblower

 for an enormous

 ai company that's worth billions of dollars might get whacked,

 that's not outside the pale.

 >> i mean, it's straight out of a movie.

 >> right out of a movie, but right out of a movie is real sometimes.

 >> yeah.

 right.

 exactly.

 >> it's a little weird that i i think they should do a proper investigation.

 like, what's the downside on that proper investigation?

 >> right.

 >> no.

 >> yeah, >> for sure.

 but the whole exchange is so bizarre.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 sam alman's reaction to being accused of murder is bizarre.

 >> look, i don't know if he's guilty, but it's not possible to look more guilty.

 >> so, i'm like, >> or look more weird.

 >> yeah.

 >> you know, maybe it's just his social thing.

 like, maybe he's just odd with confrontation and it just goes blank, you know?

 but if if somebody was accusing me of killing jamie,

 like if jamie was a whistleblower

 and jamie got whacked

 and then i'd be like, "wait,

 what are you

 what are you

 are you accusing

 me of killing

 my friend?"

 like, "what the [ __ ] are you talking about?"

 i would i

 would be

 a little bit more

 i rate.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 exactly.

 you know, it would be >> i would be a little upset.

 >> yeah.

 it'd be like well, you'd be like, you'd certainly in insist on a thorough investigation.

 yeah.

 >> as opposed to trying to sweep it under the rug.

 >> yeah.

 i wouldn't assume that he got that he committed suicide.

 i would be suspicious.

 if tucker

 was telling me that aspect

 of the story,

 i'd

 be like,

 "that

 does seem like a murder.

 [ __ ] we should look into this."

 >> i mean, all signs point to it being a murder.

 not not saying, you know, tim molvin had anything to do with the murder, but

 >> blood in two rooms.

 >> it's blood in two rooms.

 like,

 yeah, there's

 the wires to the security camera and the door dash being ordered right before suicide.

 no suicide note.

 his parents think he was murdered and

 um the people that i know who knew him said he was not suicidal.

 so i'm like this why would you jump to the conclusion >> parents

 sued the >> uh landlord?

 >> they sued the son's landlord

 alleged

 the owners and the managers of their son's san francisco

 apartment

 building were part of a widespread

 cover up of his death.

 >> the landlord >> yeah.

 there's a bunch of weird they said there was like packages missing from the building.

 some people said they saw packages still being delivered and all a sudden they all disappeared.

 >> huh.

 but that could be people steal people's packages all the time.

 >> the porch pirate situation.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 >> says they failed to safeguard.

 >> also, i mean, the amount of trauma

 those poor parents have gone through with their son dying like that.

 i mean, it must >> god bless them.

 and how could they stay sane after something like that?

 they're probably they're so griefstricken.

 who knows what they believe at this point.

 >> yeah.

 it should have asked if epson killed himself.

 yeah, that's the the cash mattel thing.

 cash mattel dan bonino trying to convince everybody of that.

 like, okay.

 >> the guards weren't there and the cameras stopped working and

 um >> you know, >> the guards were asleep.

 the cameras weren't working.

 he had a a giant

 steroided

 up bodybuilder

 guy that he was sharing a cell with that was a murderer

 who was a bad cop.

 like, all of it's kind of nuts.

 all of it's kind of nuts

 like that he would just kill himself rather than reveal all of his billionaire friends.

 >> yeah.

 >> and then >> did you see tim dylan talking to chris cuomo about this?

 >> i did.

 he liked the idea.

 >> chris cromo just looked so stupid.

 >> tim just listed off all the >> tim just

 and he's like i agree it is strange.

 like of course it's strange chris.

 jesus christ.

 you can't just go with the tide.

 you got to think things through.

 and if you think that one through, you're like, i don't think he killed himself.

 nobody does.

 you'd have to work for an intelligence agency to think he killed himself.

 >> it does.

 it does seem unlikely.

 >> it seems highly unlikely.

 highly, highly unlikely.

 all roads point to murder.

 >> yes.

 >> point to they had to get rid of him because he knew too much.

 whatever the [ __ ] he was doing, whatever kind of an asset he was, whatever

 thing he was up to,

 you know, was apparently very effective.

 >> yes.

 and a lot of people are compromised.

 you see, your boy bill gates is now saying climate change is not a big deal.

 like, relax everybody.

 i know i scared the [ __ ] out of you for the last decade

 and a half, but

 ah, we're going to be fine.

 >> yeah.

 i mean,

 you know, as was

 i was saying just before coming into the studio with, you know,

 it like every day there's some crazy

 wild new thing that's happening.

 it's it feels like reality is accelerating.

 >> it's every day.

 and every day it's like more and more

 ridiculous to the point where the simulation is more and more undeniable.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 it really feels like simulation, you know?

 it's like, come on.

 what are the odds that this could be the case?

 >> are you paying attention at all to three atlas?

 are you watching the >> the comet?

 >> yeah.

 whatever it is.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 i mean, i mean, one thing i can say is like, look, i

 if if i was aware of any evidence of aliens,

 um, you joe, you have my word.

 i will come on your show and i will reveal it on the show.

 >> okay.

 >> yeah, >> that's a good deal.

 >> yeah, it's pretty good.

 >> i'll believe you.

 yeah, thank you.

 >> i i'll stick i keep my you know, keep my promises.

 so,

 um >> all right.

 i'll hold you to that.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 and and i'm never committing suicide to be clear.

 >> i don't think you would either.

 >> so, on camera, guys, i am never committing suicide ever.

 >> if someone says you committed suicide, i will fight tooth and nail.

 >> i will fight tooth and nail.

 i will i will not believe it.

 i will not believe it.

 the thing about the three eye atlas is it's >> a hell of a name actually.

 >> yeah, it's a third eye sounds like third eye or something.

 >> yeah, it does.

 three eye is third.

 it's only the third interstellar object that's detected.

 >> okay.

 >> yeah.

 obias.

 >> yeah.

 alo was on the podcast a couple days ago talking about it.

 >> yeah.

 it could be.

 i don't know.

 but i >> apparently today they're saying that it's changed course.

 um, >> did you see that, jamie?

 >> avi said something today.

 i'll send it to you.

 um, >> uh, i know it's on reddit.

 >> here you go, jamie.

 i'll send it to you right now.

 um, it's fascinating.

 it's fascinating also because it's made almost entirely of nickel, whatever it is.

 and the only way that exists, uh, here is, uh, industrial alloys apparently.

 um

 um most no there are there are

 >> there are definitely comets that and asteroids that are made primarily of nickel in fact.

 yeah.

 so the the places where

 um you mine nickel on earth is actually where there was an asteroid

 or comet that hit earth that was a nickel rich

 you know

 >> nickel rich nickel rich rich deposit.

 >> yeah that's that's that's it's coming.

 those are from impacts.

 you definitely didn't want to be there at the time because anything would have been obliterated.

 right.

 um, but that's that's where the the sources of nickel and cobalt are these days.

 >> so, this is ovio lope.

 a few hours ago, the first hint of non-gravitational

 acceleration that something other than gravity is affecting its acceleration, meaning something is affecting

 its trajectory beyond gravity was indicated.

 interesting.

 um

 so it's mostly nickel very little iron which

 he was saying is on earth only exists in alloys

 but whatever you know you're dealing with another planet >> there this there are

 there are there are cases where there's very nickel richch asteroids meteorites that heavy

 that

 something from space.

 >> yeah it it's only yeah it doesn't mean

 it'll

 be a very sort of heavy spaceship if you make it all out of nickel.

 oh yeah.

 >> and [ __ ] huge.

 the size of manhattan and all nickel.

 that's kind of nuts.

 >> yeah, that's a heavy spaceship.

 >> that's a real problem if it hits.

 >> uh yes.

 no, it would like obliterate a continent type of thing.

 >> um maybe maybe worse.

 >> probably kill most of human life.

 >> um >> if not all of us.

 >> i haven't depends on what the the total mass is.

 but

 um there's i mean the thing is like in the fossil record there are

 um you know there's like arguably arguably five major extinction events.

 um like the biggest one of which is the perine extinction where

 um almost all life was eliminated.

 that that actually occurred over several million several million years.

 um the there's the jurassic.

 i think jurassic is i think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid.

 um and

 um but there's but there's been five major extinction events, but

 um but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take out a continent.

 >> so >> merely >> yeah.

 cuz that that because those

 don't really show up on the fossil record, you know, >> right?

 >> um so unless it's enough to cause a

 you know mass extinction event throughout earth, it it doesn't show up,

 you know, in a fossil record that's

 200 million years old.

 um so the yeah but but there have been many

 um many impacts that would have sort of destroyed all life on

 you know let's say half of north america or something like that.

# Chapter 2

 um there's i mean the thing is like in the fossil record there are

 um you know there's like arguably arguably five major extinction events.

 um like the biggest one of which is the perine extinction where

 um almost all life was eliminated.

 that that actually occurred over several million several million years.

 um the there's the jurassic.

 i think jurassic is i think that one's pretty definitively an asteroid.

 um and

 um but there's but there's been five major extinction events, but

 um but what they don't count are really the ones that merely take out a continent.

 >> so >> merely >> yeah.

 cuz that that because those

 don't really show up on the fossil record, you know, >> right?

 >> um so unless it's enough to cause a

 you know mass extinction event throughout earth, it it doesn't show up,

 you know, in a fossil record that's

 200 million years old.

 um so the yeah but but there have been many

 um many impacts that would have sort of destroyed all life on

 you know let's say half of north america or something like that.

 there many such impacts through the course of history.

 >> yeah.

 and there's nothing we can do about it right now.

 >> yeah.

 there was one that

 um hits there was a one that hit siberia and destroyed i think

 um few hundred square miles.

 >> oh, that's the tungusa.

 >> yeah.

 that's the one from the 1920s, right?

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 that's the one that coincides with that meteor that

 comet

 storm that we go through every june and every november

 that they think is responsible for that younger dest.

 >> yeah.

 yeah, all that shit's crazy.

 um,

 thank you

 before we go any further for letting us have a tour of spacex

 and letting us be there for the rocket launch.

 >> one of the absolute coolest things i've ever seen in my life.

 and we we've we were

 we thought it was only like i thought it was a half a mile.

 jamie's like it was a mile away.

 turned out it's almost two miles away.

 and you feel it in your chest.

 >> yeah.

 it's >> you have to wear earplugs

 and you feel it in your chest and it's 2 miles away.

 >> it was [ __ ] amazing.

 and then to go with you up into the command center

 and to watch all the starlink

 satellites

 with all the different cameras

 and all in real time as it made its way all the way to australia.

 how many minutes?

 like 35 40 minutes.

 >> yeah.

 >> wild it touchdown in australia.

 >> yeah.

 >> [ __ ] crazy.

 it was amazing.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 >> absolutely amazing.

 the starship's awesome.

 um, and anyone can go watch the launch actually.

 so, you can just go to

 um, south padre

 island, get has a great view of the launch.

 um, so it's like where a lot of spring breakers go.

 >> um,

 but um, but we'll be flying pretty frequently um, out of starbase in south texas.

 and we we formally incorporated it as a city.

 so, it's it's actually a legally an actual legal city, starbase, texas.

 >> um, it's not that often you hear like, hey, we made a city, you know.

 um,

 that used to be like the like in in the old days like a startup

 would be you go and

 gather a bunch of people and say, "hey, let's go make a town." literally,

 that was like that would have been startups in in in the old days.

 >> um, >> or a country.

 >> yeah.

 or a country.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 actually, >> if you tried doing that today, there'd be a real problem.

 >> yeah.

 that things are so much so much set in stone on the country front these days.

 you might pull it off.

 you might be able to pull it off.

 if you got a a solid island, you might be able to pull it off.

 >> you know, it's probably, >> you know, like like at owns lai.

 >> yeah, you could probably

 if you put if you put enough effort into it, you could make a new country.

 >> this is one of the different ones.

 this is one of the ones that you catch, >> right?

 or is that one?

 >> yeah, that that's the booster.

 so that's the super heavy booster.

 so that's the one with the booster's got 33 engines.

 um that that

 um and it's you know by version four that will have about 10,000 tons of thrust.

 um you know right now it's about 7 8,000 tons of thrust.

 um, that's that's the largest flying object ever made.

 >> i had to explain to someone.

 they were going, "why do they blow up all the time if he's so smart?"

 because there was

 there was this [ __ ] idiot on television.

 some guy was being interviewed and they were talking about you.

 and he goes, "oh, i think he's a fuckwit." and he goes, "he's a fuckwit."

 and he goes, "why you say he's [ __ ] oh, his rockets keep blowing up."

 and someone said, "yeah, well, why do his rockets blow?" and i had to explain.

 yeah.

 because it's the only way you find out what the tolerances are.

 you have to you have to a few >> corners of the box.

 so, so like so when you do a new rocket development program,

 um you you have to

 do what's called

 you know, exploring

 the limits,

 the corners of the box where you say it's like you

 worst case this,

 worst case that

 um to figure out

 um where where the limits are.

 so

 you blow up, you know, not not admittedly in the development process sometimes blows up accidentally.

 um but but we intentionally subject it to

 you know

 a flight regime

 that is much worse

 than what we expect

 in

 normal

 flight

 so that when we put people on board or

 valuable

 cargo

 it doesn't blow up.

 um so

 um so so for example for the the flight that you saw we we actually

 deliberately

 took

 um heat shield tiles off the the the ship the off of starship

 in in some of the worst locations

 to say okay if we lose a heat shield tile here is it is it catastrophic

 or is it not?

 um and we we nonetheless starship was able to do a soft landing

 um in in the indian ocean just west of australia.

 um which as and it got there from texas in like i don't know 354

 minutes type of thing.

 so >> so it landed even though you put it through this situation

 where it has compromised shield.

 it it had an an an an unusually

 we we we brought it in hot like an an extra hot trajectory

 with missing tiles

 um to see if it would still make it to a soft landing which it did.

 now i i should point out it did have

 there were some holes that were burnt into it.

 um but it's it was robust enough to land despite having some holes burnt

 you know that that you know cuz it's coming it's coming in like a blazing meteor.

 you can see you can see the real time video.

 well, tell me the speed again because the the speed was bananas.

 you were talking about >> yeah, it's like 17,000 mph

 like like 25 times the speed of sound or thereabouts.

 so,

 um the

 so so think of it like it's it's like 12 times

 faster

 than a bullet

 from an assault

 rifle.

 you know, bullet from assault rifles around mach 2 >> and it's just and it's huge.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 or or if you compare it to like a bullet from a

 um

 you know a 45 or or 9 mil which is subsonic

 that's you know it it'll be about 30 times faster than a bullet from a handgun.

 >> 30

 times

 faster

 than a bullet from a handgun

 and it's the size of a skyscraper.

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 that's fast.

 >> it's so wild.

 it's so wild to see, man.

 it it's it's so exciting.

 this the factor is so exciting too

 because like genuinely no [ __ ] i felt like i was witnessing

 history.

 i felt like it was a scene in a movie where someone had expectations

 and they like what are they doing?

 they're building rockets.

 and you go there and as we were walking through

 jamie, you could speak to this too.

 didn't you have the feeling where you're like

 >> oh this is way bigger than i thought it was.

 this is huge.

 awesome.

 >> gigantic.

 >> [ __ ] crazy.

 >> that's what she said.

 the ah the amount of rockets you're making.

 i don't know if you >> tent back.

 >> gig chad in the house.

 >> this is way big.

 >> it's a giant metal dick.

 you're [ __ ] [ __ ] the universe with your giant metal dick.

 that's >> i mean, yeah, it is.

 it is very big.

 >> and the sheer numbers of them that you guys are making.

 and then this is a version and you have a new updated version that's coming soon.

 >> and what is the it's a it's a little longer.

 um >> more pointy.

 >> uh it's the same amount of pointy.

 um but the there's it's it's got a bit more length.

 um the the interstage,

 you see that that interstage section with kind of like the grill area.

 >> mhm.

 >> um that's that's now integrated with the boost stage.

 um so we do

 um what's called hot staging.

 where we light the ship engines while it's still attached to the booster.

 so the boost the booster engines are still thrusting.

 is still it's it's

 you know it's still being pushed forward by the booster of the ship.

 but then we light the ship engines and the ship engines

 actually pull away from the booster even though the booster engines are still firing.

 >> whoa.

 >> um so it's blasting flame through

 that that grill section but we integrate that grill section into

 the boost stage with the next version of the rocket.

 um

 and and explosion in the rocket will have the raptor 3 engines which are

 a huge improvement.

 um you may you may have seen them in the lobby

 because we got like the raptor 1, two, and three.

 and you can see the dramatic improvement in simplicity.

 um we should probably put a plaque there to also show

 how much the we reduced the weight

 the cost and the and improved the efficiency and the thrust.

 so the raptor 3 has

 you know almost twice the thrust of raptor raptor 1. >> wow.

 >> so you see raptor 3. it looks like it looks like it's got parts missing.

 right.

 >> and how many >> it's very very clean.

 >> how many of them are on the rocket?

 >> there's 33 on the on the booster.

 >> whoa.

 um and and each of each raptor engine is producing

 twice as much thrust as all four engines on a 747.

 wow.

 so that engine is smaller than a 747 engine, but is producing, you know,

 um you know, almost 10 times the thrust of a 747 engine.

 um so extremely high power to weight ratio.

 um and

 um

 >> and so when there's >> 33

 of them >> you

 when you so when you're designing

 these

 you get to raptor

 one

 you see its efficiency

 you see where you can improve it

 you get to raptor 2 how many

 how far can you scale this up with just

 the same sort of technology with propellant and ignition and engines

 like how much further can you

 >> i mean we're pushing the limits of physics here

 um so

 um

 and and really in order to to make a a fully reusable

 orbital rocket which no one has succeeded in doing yet including

 including us.

 um but but

 starship is the first time that there is a design for a rocket

 where where full and rapid reusability is actually possible.

 so it was not there's not there's not even been a design

 before where it was possible.

 certainly not a design that that that got made any hardware at all.

 um just we just we just live we live on a planet where the gravity

 is is is quite high like earth's gravity is quite really quite quite high.

 um

 um and if the gravity was even 10 or 20%

 higher we'd be stuck on earth forever.

 um like we yeah we could not use certainly couldn't use conventional rockets.

 you'd have to like blow yourself off the surface with like a nuclear

 bomb or something crazy.

 um

 so but on the other hand if if earth's gravity was just a little

 lower like even 10 20% lower it then

 getting to orbit would be easy.

 so it's like it's like

 it's like this if this was a video game it's set to like

 maximum difficulty but not impossible.

 >> okay.

 >> um so that's that's where we have

 um here.

 so it's it's not as though

 um others have ignored the concept of reusability.

 they've just concluded that it was too difficult to achieve.

 and we've been working at on on this for a long time at at spacex.

 um and

 um you know, i'm the chief engineer of the company.

 um although i should say that that you know, we have an extremely talented engineering team.

 i think we've got the best rocket engineering team that has ever been assembled.

 um it's it's an honor to work with such such incredible people.

 um so

 so so it's fair to say that

 you know we have not yet succeeded in creating in achieving full reusability

 but we at last have a rocket

 where full reusability is possible.

 um and i think i think we'll achieve it next year.

 so

 um that's a that's a really big deal.

 and the reason the reason that's that's such a big deal is that full reusability

 um drops the cost of access to space by a hundred

 um maybe even more than 100 actually.

 so could be like a thousand.

 the you can think of it like any mode of transport.

 like imagine if aircraft were were not reusable.

 like you flew somewhere, you throw the plane

 like like imagine if like the way the way conventional rockets work

 is it would be like if you had an airplane

 and and and

 instead of landing at your destination,

 you parachute out

 um and the plane crashes somewhere

 and you land at your desk

 and you and you land on a parachute at your

 destination.

 now that would be a very expensive trip

 and you and you'd need another plane to get back.

 okay.

 um, but that's how the other rockets in the world work.

 um,

 now the spacex falcon rocket

 is the only one that is is there that is at least mostly reusable.

 you've se you've seen the falcon rocket, you know, land.

 we've now done over 500 landings

 of of the spacex rocket

 of the of the falcon 9 rocket.

 um and

 um and and this year

 um you know we we'll deliver probably i don't know

 somewhere between 2200 and 2500 tons to orbit

 um with with the falcon 9 falcon heavy rockets not counting anything for from starship.

 um >> and this is mostly starlink.

 yes, mostly starling, but we launch many other we even launch our competitors on

 um competitors to starink on on falcon 9. we charge them the same price.

 pretty fair.

 um but spacex this year will deliver

 um roughly 90% of all earth mass to orbit.

 >> wow.

 >> um and then of the remaining 10%

 um most of that is done by china.

 and then the then the remaining kind of roughly 4%

 is

 everyone else in the world including our america domestic competitors.

 >> you know

 um

 it's kind of incredible how many things are in space

 like how many things are floating above us now?

 >> there's a lot of things.

 >> yeah.

 >> is there though?

 >> right.

 but is there a saturation point where

 we're going to have problems with all these different satellites that are

 >> um i think as long as the satellites are

 um maintained there's there it'll be fine.

 this space is very roomy.

 um it's like you can think of

 um like space as being concentric shells of the surface of the earth.

 so,

 um,

 you know, there's there's

 it's the surface of the earth, but but there's it's a series >> much larger.

 >> yeah.

 it's like a series of concentric trails.

 um, >> and think of an airstream trailer flying around up there.

 there's a lot of room for air streams.

 >> yeah.

 i mean, imagine yeah.

 if there just a few thousand airirstreams

 um on on earth.

 >> yeah.

 >> what are the odds that they'd hit each other?

 you know, >> they wouldn't be very crowded.

 no.

 and then you got to go bigger.

 >> yeah.

 >> because you're dealing with far above earth.

 >> hundreds of miles above earth.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 >> yeah.

 so, it's the

 um but the goal of spacex is to

 get

 rocket

 technology

 to the point where we can extend life beyond earth and that we can establish

 a

 self-sustaining

 city on mars.

 a permanent base on the moon.

 that would be very cool.

 i mean, imagine if we had like a, you know, moon base alpha

 where there's like a permanent science base on the moon.

 >> that would be pretty dope.

 or at least a tourist trap.

 >> i mean,

 a lot of people be willing to go to the moon for just for a tour.

 that's for sure.

 we could probably pay for our space program with that, you know, >> probably.

# Chapter 3

 >> yeah.

 so, it's the

 um but the goal of spacex is to

 get

 rocket

 technology

 to the point where we can extend life beyond earth and that we can establish

 a

 self-sustaining

 city on mars.

 a permanent base on the moon.

 that would be very cool.

 i mean, imagine if we had like a, you know, moon base alpha

 where there's like a permanent science base on the moon.

 >> that would be pretty dope.

 or at least a tourist trap.

 >> i mean,

 a lot of people be willing to go to the moon for just for a tour.

 that's for sure.

 we could probably pay for our space program with that, you know, >> probably.

 yeah.

 well, >> because it's like if if you if you could go to the moon

 with and and

 safely,

 >> uh

 i think we'd get a lot of people would would pay for that, you know.

 >> oh, 100%.

 after the first year, after nobody died for like >> yeah.

 just make sure.

 exactly.

 are you going to come back?

 yeah.

 >> because like that submarine, they they had a bunch of successful

 launches in that private submarine before it imploded and killed everybody.

 that was not a good design.

 obviously, >> it was a very bad design.

 terrible design.

 >> and the engineers said it would not withstand the pressure of those depths.

 like there was a lot of whistleblowers in that company too.

 >> yeah.

 um they they they made that out of

 carbon fiber which is it doesn't make any sense because

 um you actually need you need to be dense to go down.

 um in any case, just make it out of steel.

 if you make it out of

 sort of just, you know,

 a big steel casting, that's that's you you'll be safe and nothing.

 why would they make it out of carbon fiber then?

 is it cheaper?

 >> um i think they think carbon fiber sounds cool or something.

 but >> it does sound cool.

 >> it it sounds cool, but

 um

 because it's such it's such low density, you actually actually have to add extra mass to

 go down because it's it's low density.

 but if you just have a giant, you know, hollow ball bearing,

 you're going to be fine.

 >> speaking of carbon fiber, did you check out my unplugged tesla out there?

 >> yeah, it's cool.

 >> pretty sick, right?

 yeah.

 have you guys ever thought about doing something like that?

 like having like an amg division of tesla where you do like custom stuff.

 >> um i think it's best to leave that to the custom shops.

 you know we're we're like tesla's focus is autonomous cars.

 um you know building kind of futuristic autonomous cars.

 um so

 um like i think it's we want the future to look like the future.

 um, so the did like did you see like our designs for like the sort of

 the robotic bus?

 it looks pretty cool.

 >> the robotic bus is also being totally auton

 but it looks it looks cool.

 it's it's very art deco.

 it's it's like it's like futuristic art deco.

 um, and um,

 it it does it like i think we want to change the aesthetic over time.

 you don't want the aesthetic to be constant over time.

 you want to evolve the aesthetic.

 um,

 so um,

 you know, like my like i have a son who's he's like,

 you know, he's he's he's like

 even more autistic than me and

 um and, uh, but he's he has these great observations.

 who is this?

 >> a saxon.

 he has these great observations

 in the world

 uh because

 he's

 he just views the world through a different lens

 than than most people.

 um and he was like, "dad, why does the world look like it's 2015?"

 >> and i'm like, "damn, the world does look like it's 2015."

 like the aesthetic has not evolved since 2015. >> oh, that's what it looks like.

 >> yeah.

 >> oh, wow.

 >> that's pretty cool.

 >> oh, yeah.

 that's like >> like you'd want to see that going down the road, you know?

 >> yeah.

 you'd be like, "okay, this is we're in the future."

 you know, it doesn't look like 2015.

 >> what is that ancient science fiction movie?

 like one of the first science fiction movies ever.

 is it metropolis?

 is that what it is?

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 >> yeah.

 that looks like it belongs in metropolis.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 it's a futuristic art deco.

 >> all right.

 yeah.

 well, that's cool that you're concentrating on the aesthetic.

 i mean, that's kind of the whole deal with cybertruck, right?

 like, it didn't have to look like that.

 >> no, it it i just wanted to have something that looked really different.

 is it a pain in the ass for people to get it insured

 because it's all solid

 steel

 and

 >> um i hope it's not too much.

 i you know tesla

 does offer insurance

 so people can always get it get it insured

 at tesla.

 >> um well but the like it is the

 form does follow a function in the case of the cybert truck because

 um as you demonstrated with with your armorpiercing arrow

 um because if you shot that arrow at a regular truck i mean >> it

 exactly you would have found your arrow in the wall.

 yeah.

 um, you know, it would very least it would have buried into one of the seats.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 it's but like you could you could definitely make

 get enough of

 bow velocity

 and and the right the right arrow

 would go through both doors of a regular truck and and and land on the wall.

 >> if there was a clear shot

 between

 both doors,

 it probably would have passed right through.

 >> exactly.

 um

 but but

 you know the the arrow shattered

 on the cybert truck cuz it's it's ultra hard

 stainless.

 mhm.

 >> um, so,

 um,

 and i thought it' be i thought it'd be cool to have

 a, you know, a truck that is bulletproof to a subsonic projectile.

 um,

 so,

 um, you know, especially in this day and age, you know,

 like as

 as a if, if the apocalypse

 happens, you're going to want to have a bulletproof

 truck, you know.

 um, so so then because

 because it's made of ultra hot stainless, it's you can't just stamp the the panels.

 you can't just put in a stamping press because it breaks the press.

 so, so in order to actually, so it has to has to be planer

 um because it's so difficult to bend it because it breaks the machine that bends it.

 um that's why that's why it's it's it's it's so planer

 and and it's not you know it's it's because it's

 bulletproof steel is the

 >> so it is like boxy as opposed to like curved and >> yeah.

 you just in order to make in order to make like the curved shapes,

 you you you

 take you take

 basically mild steel like

 um anneal thin and thin anneal in a regular truck or car.

 the

 you take you take mild

 thin

 anneal

 steel, you put it in a stamping

 press and it just

 sm

 it just

 smooshes

 it

 and makes it to whatever the shape whatever shape you want.

 but the cybert truck is made made of ultra hard stainless.

 um and and and so you can't stamp it because it would break the stamping press.

 so it even bending it is hard.

 so even to bend it to its current position, we have to way overbend it.

 um

 and and

 so it gets

 so that when it springs

 back, it's in in the right position.

 um, so it's

 i don't know like i i think if you want to

 like

 i think it's it's it's

 a unique aesthetic.

 um, and you say, "well, what's cool about a truck?" trucks are trucks are

 like should be i don't know manly.

 they should be macho, you know, and bulletproof is maximum macho macho.

 >> are you married to that shape now?

 like is it can you do anything to change it?

 like as you get further like i know you guys updated the three and the y.

 did you update the y as well?

 >> yes, the the three and the y are updated.

 um you know, there's like a

 um

 there's there's

 a a screen in the back for the kid that the kids can watch,

 for example,

 in the new 3 and y.

 um so in the new y,

 um there's, you know, it's it's an there's there's there's like hundreds of improvements.

 like we keep improving the car.

 um and even the cybert truck, we you know, we keep improving it.

 um but

 um

 you know i wanted to just do something that that looked unique

 and and the cybert truck looks unique and has unique functionality

 and

 there was and it was like

 there were three things as i report like let's make it bulletproof.

 let's make it faster than a porsche 911. uh, and we actually cleared the quarter mile.

 the cybert truck, the the can

 clear a quarter mile while towing a porsche 911 faster than a porsche 911.

 um, it can out tow an f350 diesel.

 >> really?

 >> yes.

 >> what is the tow limitations?

 >> i mean, we could tow like a, you know, a 747

 in that with a cy.

 cybert truck is an insanely like it is an it is alien technology.

 okay.

 um cuz it it shouldn't be possible to be that big and that fast.

 that doesn't it's like an elephant that runs as as like a cheetah.

 >> yeah.

 because it's 0 to 60 in less than 3 seconds, right?

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 and it's enormous.

 what does it weigh?

 like 7,000 lbs.

 >> uh yeah, there's different configurations, but it's about that.

 it's a beast.

 >> yeah.

 >> um so and it's and it's got it's got four-wheel steering.

 so the the rear wheel steer, too.

 so it's got a it's got a very tight turning radius.

 >> yeah.

 we noticed that we when we drove one to star base.

 >> yeah.

 very tight turning radius.

 >> yeah.

 pretty sick.

 >> yeah.

 >> are you still doing the roadster?

 >> yes.

 eventually,

 >> we're getting close to demonstrating the prototype >> and i think this will be

 i i i i one thing i can guarantee is that this product demo

 will be unforgettable.

 unforgettable.

 >> how so?

 whether it's good or bad, it will be unforgettable.

 um, >> can you say more?

 what do you mean?

 >> well, you know, my friend peter teal,

 um, you know, uh, once reflected that

 the future was supposed to have flying cars, but we don't have flying cars.

 >> so, you're going to be able to fly?

 well, i mean,

 uh,

 i think if peter wants a flying car, we should should be able to buy one.

 >> so, you are you actively considering making an electric flying car?

 is this like a real thing?

 >> well, we have to see in the >> in the demo.

 so, when you do this, like are are you going to have a retractable wing?

 like, what is the idea behind this?

 don't be sly.

 come on.

 >> i i i can't i can't do the unveil before the unveil.

 um but

 um >> tell me off air then.

 >> i i i it look i i think it has a shot at being

 the most memorable

 um product unveil ever.

 it has a shot.

 >> and when do you plan on doing this?

 what's the goal?

 >> uh hopefully before the end of the year.

 >> really?

 >> before the end of this year.

 >> this is i mean we're in a couple months.

 >> hopefully in a couple months.

 um you know we need to make sure that it works.

 like this is some crazy crazy technology we got in this car.

 crazy technology.

 crazy crazy.

 so different than what was previously announced and >> yes.

 >> and is that why you haven't released it yet?

 cuz you keep [ __ ] with it.

 >> it has crazy technology.

 >> okay.

 >> like is it even a car?

 i'm not sure.

 it's like it looks like a car.

 let's just put this way.

 it it's it's crazier than anything james bond.

 if you took all the james bond cars and combined them, it's crazier than that.

 >> very exciting.

 >> i don't know what to think of that.

 >> i don't know.

 >> it's a limited amount of information i'm drawing from here.

 >> jamie's very suspicious over there.

 look at him.

 >> excited.

 >> i'm interested.

 >> it's still going to be the same.

 >> well, you know what?

 i mean, if if you want to if you want to come a little before the

 the unveil, i can show it to you 100%.

 yeah, let's go.

 >> yeah.

 um

 it's

 it's kind of crazy

 all the different things that you're involved in simultaneously

 and you know we talked about this before your time management but

 i i really don't understand it.

 i don't understand how you can be paying attention to all these different things simultaneously.

 starlink, spacex, tesla, boring company

 x you're tweet you [ __ ] tweet or post rather all day long.

 well, it's more like i'm i'm

 i could hop in for like two minutes and then hop out, you know.

 >> but i mean, just the fact that you could do >> bathroom break or whatever,

 you know,

 >> i can't do that.

 >> um >> if i hop in, i start scrolling and i start looking around.

 next thing you know, i've lost an hour.

 >> yeah.

 >> um so, no, it's for me it's it's a couple minutes time usually.

 it's once in a

 sometimes

 i guess it's half an hour,

 but

 usually

 i'm

 i'm

 i'm in

 for

 a

 few minutes

 then

 out

 of of

 you know, posting something on x.

 uh,

 you know, it's i do sometimes feel like it's sometimes like

 that that meme of the guy who's like who drops the grenade and leaves the room.

 that's been me more than once on on x.

 >> yeah.

 oh, yeah.

 yeah, for sure.

 um, it's got to be fun, though.

 it's got to be fun to know that you essentially disrupted

 the entire social media chain of command

 because there was a there was a very clear

 thing that was going on with social media.

 the government had infiltrated it.

 they were censoring speech

 >> and until you bought it, we really didn't know the extent of it.

 we kind of assumed that there was something going on.

 >> yeah.

 we had no idea that they were actively involved in censoring

 actual real news stories,

 real data,

 real scientists,

 real professors

 silenced,

 expelled,

 kicked off the platform.

 >> yeah.

 >> wild.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 >> for telling the truth.

 >> for telling the truth.

 and i'm sure you've also because i sent it to you that chart that shows

 young kids, teenagers identifying as trans and non-binary

 literally

 stops dead when you bought twitter

 and starts falling off a cliff when people are allowed to have rational

 discussions

 now

 and actually talk about it.

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 >> um yeah.

 yeah, i mean i i said at the time like i think that like

 the the like the reason for acquiring twitter is because

 um it was it it was c it was causing destruction at a civilizational level.

 um it was

 um i mean i posted i tweeted on on twitter at the time that

 um it it is

 um you know it's it's worm tongue for the world.

 um you know like worm tongue from

 lord of the rings where he would just sort of

 like whisper these

 you know terrible things to the king

 so the king would believe these things that

 weren't true

 um and and

 um unfortunately

 twitter really got it got like the the the woke mob essentially they controlled twitter

 um and they were pushing a nihilistic anti-vilizational mind virus to the world.

 um, and you can see the results of that mind virus

# Chapter 4

 >> yeah.

 >> um yeah.

 yeah, i mean i i said at the time like i think that like

 the the like the reason for acquiring twitter is because

 um it was it it was c it was causing destruction at a civilizational level.

 um it was

 um i mean i posted i tweeted on on twitter at the time that

 um it it is

 um you know it's it's worm tongue for the world.

 um you know like worm tongue from

 lord of the rings where he would just sort of

 like whisper these

 you know terrible things to the king

 so the king would believe these things that

 weren't true

 um and and

 um unfortunately

 twitter really got it got like the the the woke mob essentially they controlled twitter

 um and they were pushing a nihilistic anti-vilizational mind virus to the world.

 um, and you can see the results of that mind virus

 on the streets of san francisco,

 uh, where,

 you know, downtown san francisco looks like a zombie apocalypse.

 um, you know, it's it's bad.

 um, so we don't want the whole world to be a zombie apocalypse.

 um, but that's

 that that that was essentially they were pushing this very negative, nihilistic, untrue worldview

 on the world and it was causing a lot of damage.

 um, so >> the stunning thing about it is how few people course corrected.

 a bunch of people woke up and realized what was going on.

 people that were all on board with like woke ideology in maybe 2015

 or

 16

 and then

 and then eventually

 it comes to affect

 them or they see it in their workplace

 or they see and they're like, "whoa, whoa, whoa, we got to stop this."

 bunch of people did, but a lot of people never course corrected.

 >> yeah.

 um,

 a lot of a lot of people didn't course correct, but

 um,

 but it's gone directionally in it's gone it's it's directionally correct like you mentioned like the

 like the massive spike in in kids identifying as trans

 and then that that spike dropping

 um after the the twitter acquisition.

 i think that

 um simply allowing the truth to be told

 um was that just shedding sun sunlight is the best disinfectant as they say

 and just allowing sunlight

 um kills the virus >> and it also changed the benchmark for all the other platforms.

 yes, you can't just openly censor people and all the other platforms and x is available.

 so everybody else had a so like facebook announced they were changing

 youtube announced they were changing their policies

 and they're kind of forced to and then blue sky doubled down.

 >> well, like the problem is like if

 >> uh essentially the woke mind virus retreated to woke to to blue sky.

 >> yeah.

 >> um but it's where they're just a self-reinforcing lunatic assign.

 >> they're all just triple masked.

 i i was i was totally watching this exchange

 on a blue sky where someone said that they're just trying to be zen about something

 and then someone a moderator immediately chimed in and

 why don't you try to stop being racist against asians by saying something zen

 by saying i'm trying to be zen about something.

 they were accusing that person of being racist towards asians.

 >> yeah.

 it's it's just it's just everyone's a hall monitor over there.

 the worst hall monitor.

 a virgin like incel.

 >> they're all home monitors trying to rat on each other.

 >> yeah, it's fascinating.

 and then people say, "i'm leaving for blue sky like stephen king."

 and then a couple weeks later, he's back on x.

 just like, "fuck it.

 it's there's no one over there.

 it's all a bunch of crazy people.

 you can only stay in the asylum for so long.

 like, all right, this this is not good." they all bail.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 >> threads is kind of like that, too.

 threads is >> i' i've been on threads as is it?

 well, what happens is if you go on instagram,

 every now and then it'll something really stupid will pop up on threads

 like what the [ __ ] and it shows it to you on instagram

 and then i'll click on that and then i'll go to threads and it's like

 >> you see posts with like 25 likes like famous people like 50 like it's it's

 down

 >> but the people that post on there

 they're finding that there's very little push back from

 insane ideology

 so they go there and they spit out nonsense

 and very few people jump in to argue.

 you.

 >> yeah.

 um, >> very weird, very weird place.

 >> i mean, i can generally

 get the vibe

 of

 like what's

 taking off

 by seeing what's

 showing up on

 x

 cuz that's the public town square

 still.

 um, >> and or or

 you know what what

 links show up in group texts,

 you know, if i'm in group chat with friends, like where where what what

 links are showing up?

 >> that's what i try to do now.

 only get stuff that shows up in my group text because that keeps me productive.

 so, i only check if someone's like, "dude,

 what the fuck?" like, "all right, what the [ __ ] let me check it out."

 >> if there's something that's crazy enough that your

 it'll it'll end with the group chat, >> but there's always something.

 that's what's nuts.

 there's always some new law that's passed, some new insane thing that california is doing.

 and it's like like a giant chunk of it's happening in california.

 the most preposterous things that i get.

 >> yeah.

 >> and then you got gavin newsome who's running around saying we all have california derangement

 syndrome.

 he's just like ripping off trump derangement and calling it california derangement.

 i was like, "no, no, no, no, no, no.

 the the [ __ ] how many corporations have left california?" >> it's crazy.

 >> hundreds.

 hundreds, >> right?

 hundreds.

 >> that's not good.

 >> chick i mean, not chick-fil-a.

 i mean, i think in-n-out left.

 >> yeah.

 in and outlift.

 they moved to tennessee.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 they're like, "we can't do this anymore." >> right.

 and >> it's the california company for food.

 it's like the greatest hamburger place ever.

 >> it's awesome.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 and no, actually

 speaking of like like just sort of open source and like looking at things openly

 like you i just like going in and out and seeing them make the burger.

 >> yeah.

 it's right there.

 >> they chop the onions and they they

 you know it's you just see everything getting made in front of you.

 >> yeah.

 >> it's great.

 >> um but yeah

 like

 like it should be like how many wakeup

 calls do you need

 to say that there needs to be reform

 in california,

 you know?

 >> well, the crazy thing that newsome

 does is whenever

 someone brings up the problems in california,

 he starts rattling off all the positives.

 the most fortune 500 companies, highest education.

 but yeah, that was all already there, right before you were governor.

 >> but but how many fortune 500 companies have left california?

 >> and then

 you guys spent $ 24 billion on the homeless and it got way worse.

 >> yes.

 like the homeless

 population doubled or something like but like

 people don't understand like the homeless thing because it it

 sort of prays on people's empathy

 and i i think we should have empathy.

 um and we should try to help people.

 um but the the the

 the homeless industrial complex is is really it's it's it's dark man.

 um it should be that that that that

 network of ngos's should be called like the drug zombie farmers.

 um because they they the the more homeless people and and and really

 like when you when you meet like you know somebody who's like

 totally dead inside

 shuffling along down the street with a with a needle dang dangling out of their leg.

 homeless is the wrong word.

 like the homeless implies that somebody got a little behind in their mortgage payments

 and if they just got a job offer, they'd be back on their feet.

 but someone who's

 i mean, you see these videos of people that are just shuffling,

 you know, they're on fentanyl.

 they're they're like,

 >> you know, taking a dump in the middle of the street, you know,

 and they they got like open sores and stuff.

 >> they're not like one drop offer away from getting back on their feet, >> right?

 this is not a homeless issue.

 >> homeless is it's it's a propaganda word, >> right?

 um so and and then the the the the

 you know these sort of charities

 inquiries are they they get money proportionate to the number of homeless

 people or or number of drug zombies.

 >> so their incentive structure is to maximize the number of drug zombies not minimize it.

 >> um that's why they don't arrest the drug dealers

 >> because if they arrest the drug dealers the drug zombies leave.

 so they know who the drug dealers are.

 they don't arrest them on purpose.

 because otherwise

 the drug zombies

 would leave

 and they would they would stop getting money from the state of california

 and from from all the charities.

 >> wait a minute.

 so so they so they is that real?

 so they're in coordination with law enforcement on this?

 >> yeah.

 >> so how do they how do they have those meetings?

 >> they're all in cahoots.

 >> well, when you find this >> it's like such it's it's this is a diabolical

 scam.

 um so and and san francisco has got this tax this this gross receipts tax

 which which

 um it's not even on revenue, it's on old transactions which is why stripe

 um and square and and and

 a whole bunch of financial companies had to move out of san francisco

 because it wasn't a tax on revenue, it's taxed on transactions.

 so if if you did like, you know, trillions of dollars transactions, it's not revenue.

 you're taxed on any money going through the system in san francisco.

 um so

 um

 like jack dorsey

 pointed this out

 and they said like

 that they had had to move square

 from

 san francisco to

 oakland i think stripe had to move from san francisco to south san francisco different city.

 um and that money goes to the homeless industrial complex that that tax that was passed.

 um so

 um so there's billions of dollars that go as you pointed out

 billions of dollars every year that go to

 these

 um non-governmental organizations that are funded by the state.

 like there's it's not clear how to turn this off.

 um it's a self-licking ice cream cone situation.

 um so

 they get this money the money is proportionate to the number of of homeless people

 or or number of drug zombies essentially.

 um, so they they they try to keep the that they try to actually increase

 because that like

 like in in some cases like there's

 it's it's

 somebody did an analysis when you add up all the money that's flowing,

 they're getting close to a million dollars per homeless per per drug zombie.

 it's like $900,000

 or something like some crazy amount of money is is is going to these organizations.

 so if if so so they want to keep people just barely alive.

 they need to keep them in the area so they so they they get the revenue.

 so and

 so that's why like said they don't arrest the drug dealers because otherwise

 the drug zombies would leave

 um

 and and and and they but

 but they don't want you have to have too much

 if they get too much drugs and they

 then they die.

 so it's they they're kept in this sort of perpetual zone of of being addicted but

 um but but just just barely alive.

 >> so how is this coordinated with like das das that don't prosecute people?

 so when they

 when they hire the or they push so they they

 fund the campaigns of the most progressive,

 most out there leftwing

 das,

 they get them into office.

 >> we've got that issue in austin, too, by the way.

 >> you see that guy that got shot in the library?

 >> no.

 >> yeah, i heard a guy got shot and killed in the library.

 >> i think that was just like last week or something, >> right?

 >> um

 so some friends of mine were telling me that that like the library is unsafe.

 like they took their kids to the library

 and and there were like dangerous people in the library in austin

 and i was like dangerous people in the library like that's a strange

 it basically got like got like

 drug zombies in drug zombies in the library.

 >> oh jesus.

 >> um >> and that's when someone got shot.

 >> yeah, i believe this was should be on the news.

 you might might be able to pull it up.

 um but i think it was just in the last week or so that

 there was a shooting in the library in austin.

 um

 cuz austin's

 got,

 you know, it's it's the most liberal part of texas that we're in right right here.

 um

 >> so suspect involved the shooting austin park library

 saturday is accused of another shooting at the cap metro

 bus earlier that day.

 according to an arrest warrant affidavit, austin police arrested harold newton keen, 55

 short shortly after the shooting of the library, which occurred around noon.

 one person sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the event.

 before that shooting, keane was accused of shooting another person in a bus incident

 and after reportedly pointing his gun at a child.

 so, this is the fella down here.

 >> so, like we just have a seriously have a problem here.

 um >> yeah,

 >> you know,

 so i i think one of the people might have died

 too

 that he shot.

 um so,

 um like one of the people i think i think did bleed out.

 um >> but either way, it's like getting shot is still bad.

 um

 it says the victim told police it confronted the suspect

 who started to eat what appeared to be crystal methamphetamine.

 according to the affidavit the victim advised the suspect

 began to trip out at which time the victim exited the bus.

 victim told the bus driver

 hit the panic button and then exited the bus when he turned around the observer.

 black male was now standing at the front of the bus with the gun pointed

 at him.

 the victim advised the black male fired a single round which grazed his left hip.

 so he shot at that dude and then another dude got shot in the library.

 fun.

 >> yeah.

 i mean in the library.

 >> yeah.

 >> you know, where you're supposed to be reading books.

 um and there's a children's

 section in the library and says he pointed his gun

 at a at a kid.

 i mean like we do have a serious issue in the in in in america where

 um repeat violent offenders need to be incarcerated, >> right?

 um,

 and

 uh, you know, you got you got cases where somebody's been arrested like 47

 times, right?

 like literally.

 okay, that's just the number of times they were arrested,

 not the number of times they did things.

 like most of the times they do things, they're not arrested.

 um, >> so lay this out for people so they understand how this happens.

 >> yeah.

 and and the key is like this, it prays on people's empathy.

 episode like if you're a good person,

 you want good things to happen in the world, you're like, well,

 we should take care of people who

 you know

 you know

 who are down in their luck or you know having a hard time in life.

 and i we should i agree.

 but what we shouldn't do is is put people who are violent drug zombies

 in public places where they can hurt other people.

 um, and that's what that is what we're doing that we just saw where

 a a guy, you know, got shot

 shot in the library and then but even before that he shot another guy

 um and pointed his gun at a kid.

 um that that that guy probably has like many prior arrests.

 um you know there was that that that guy that that that knifed

 the ukrainian woman arena.

 >> yes.

 >> um yeah.

 and you know

 um

 and she was just she was just quietly

 on her phone and you just came up and

 you know gutted her basically.

 >> wasn't there a crazy story about the judge who was involved who had previously

 dealt with this person was also

 invested in a rehabilitation center and was sending these >> conflict of interest.

 >> yes.

 so sending people that they were charging yeah.

 to a rehabilitation center instead of putting them in jail, profiting

 from this rehabilitation center, letting them back out on the street.

 yes.

 violent, insane people.

 >> and and there

 um in that case that i believe that judge has no legal law degree

 or a significant legal experience that would allow them to be a judge.

 they were just made a judge.

 that there's like >> you could be a judge without a law degree.

 >> yeah.

 >> wow.

 >> yeah.

 >> you could just be a so i could be a judge.

 >> yeah.

 oh, exciting.

 >> anyone?

 >> that's crazy.

 i

 thought you'd

 have to

 it's

 like if you want to be a doctor,

 you have to go to

 medical

 school.

 i thought if you're going to be a judge,

 >> if you're going to be appointed

 to a judge,

 you have to have

 proven

 that

 you

 have

 an

 excellent knowledge of the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law.

 that's what we assume should be.

 >> that's how you get the robe, >> right?

 >> you don't get the robe unless you do,

# Chapter 5

 thought you'd

 have to

 it's

 like if you want to be a doctor,

 you have to go to

 medical

 school.

 i thought if you're going to be a judge,

 >> if you're going to be appointed

 to a judge,

 you have to have

 proven

 that

 you

 have

 an

 excellent knowledge of the law and that you will make your decisions according to the law.

 that's what we assume should be.

 >> that's how you get the robe, >> right?

 >> you don't get the robe unless you do,

 >> you know, >> got to go to school to get the robe.

 >> you got to know what the law is, >> right?

 and then you're going to need to make decisions in accordance with the law

 >> based on

 stuff that you already know cuz you read it cuz you went to school for it.

 yes.

 not you just got appointed.

 >> got vibes.

 you can't be just vibing as a judge.

 >> vibing as a leftwing drudge.

 so you got crazy leftwing das.

 >> yes.

 >> like i should say leftwing cuz leftwing >> used to be normal.

 >> yeah.

 left wing just meant like like yeah.

 you're like the left used to be like pro pro- free speech.

 yeah.

 and now they're against it.

 >> it used to be like prog gay rights, pro women's right to choose, pro- minorities,

 pro,

 you know, >> like,

 yeah, like

 20 years ago,

 i don't know, it it used to be like left would be like

 the the the

 party of empathy or like, you know, caring

 and being nice and that kind of thing.

 >> um, not not the party of like crushing dissent and crushing free speech.

 um and you know crazy regulation and and just

 um and being super judgy u and calling everyone a nazi

 um you know

 um

 like i think they called you and me nazis

 you know

 >> oh yeah i'm a nazi

 >> i no

 i have friends that are comedians that called you a nazi and i got pissed off

 oh yeah yeah yeah

 definitely a nazi no

 because you did that thing at the my heart goes out to you everyone

 everyone

 all of them.

 literally, tim walls, kla harris, every one of them did it.

 they all did it.

 >> like, like h how do you point at the crowd?

 yeah.

 how do you wave at the crowd?

 >> do you know cnn

 was using a photo of me whenever i got in trouble during co

 >> from the ufc weigh-ins?

 and if the ufc weigh-ins, i go, "hey everybody, welcome to the weigh-ins."

 and so they were getting me from the side.

 and that was the photo that they used.

 conspiracy theorist podcaster joe ro.

 like that's what they used.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 but that's what the left is today.

 it's super judgy and calling everyone a nazi and trying to suppress freedom of speech.

 >> yeah.

 and eventually

 you run out of people to accuse

 because people get pissed off and they leave.

 >> yeah.

 everyone it's like

 it

 like

 it it no longer

 frankly

 it doesn't matter to be called racist

 or nazi or whatever because

 >> still recording.

 >> it's the government man.

 >> is it working?

 >> we're good.

 okay.

 >> okay.

 >> this thing working.

 >> yeah.

 slight issue.

 >> i'm the one that heard it.

 but >> yeah.

 when you when you text people, do you

 are you like keenly aware

 that there's a high likelihood that someone's reading your texts?

 >> um

 i guess

 i i guess i >> i assume >> i look if if if if intelligence agencies

 aren't trying to read my phone, they should probably be fired.

 >> at least they get some fun memes.

 i got to i got to crack them up once in a while, you know.

 >> oh, for sure.

 i crack them up.

 >> there's like, "hey guys, check it out.

 we've got a banger here, you know." >> so,

 i want to i wanted to talk to you about

 whether or not

 encrypted apps are really secure.

 >> uh, no.

 >> right.

 cuz i know the tucker thing.

 so, it was explained to me by a friend who

 used to do this, used to work for the government.

 it's like they can look at your

 signal,

 but what they have to do is take the information that's encrypted

 and then they have to decrypt it and it's very expensive.

 so they said he told me that for the tucker

 carlson

 thing when they found out that he was going to interview

 putin,

 it costs like something like $750,000

 just to decrypt his messages to find out that they did it.

 so it is possible to do.

 it's just not that easy to do.

 i think you should view any given messaging system as

 um not not whether it's secure or not, but but there are degrees of insecurity.

 so

 um so there's just some things that are less insecure than others.

 um so

 um you know on on x we just rebuilt the entire messaging stack

 um into x what's called xchat.

 >> yeah, that's what i wanted to ask you about.

 >> yeah, it's cool.

 um, so it's it's using sort of peer-to-peer sort of kind of a peer-to-peer based

 encryption system.

 so kind of similar to bitcoin.

 um so it's it's it's i think very good encryption.

 we're and you know we're testing it thoroughly.

 we're not there's there's no hooks in the x systems for advertising.

 so if you look look at something like whatsapp

 or

 really any of the others, they've got they've got hooks in there for advertising.

 >> when you say hooks, what do you mean by that?

 >> uh exactly.

 what do you mean biohook advertising?

 um the so like whatsapp

 um

 knows enough about what you're texting

 to show you to show you to know what ads to show you.

 >> ah >> but then like that that's a massive security vulnerability.

 >> yeah.

 >> um

 because if it knows if if it's got information

 enough information to show you ads, it's got enough it's got that's a lot of information.

 >> yeah.

 >> um so they call it oh it's just don't worry about it.

 it's just a hook for advertising.

 i'm like okay.

 so somebody can just

 use that same hook to get in there and look at your messages.

 um so xhat has no hooks for advertising.

 um and i'm not saying it's perfect.

 but it's an our goal with xchat

 is to replace what used to be the twitter

 you the twitter dm stack with a fully encrypted system

 where you can text send files

 do audio video calls

 um and

 um

 and it's it's

 you know i think it'll be the least

 i would call it the least insecure

 of any messaging

 system.

 >> are you going to launch it as a standalone

 app or is it will always be incorporated to x?

 >> uh we'll have both.

 so

 um

 >> so so be

 like signal so anybody can get it

 >> you can get get the

 you'll be able to just get the x chat app by itself

 um and like i said you could do texts audio video calls or send files

 um and there'll be a dedicated app which will hopefully release in a few months

 um but and then also integrated into the x system

 >> um

 the x phone people keeps talking

 keep is that >> i have a lot on my plate man

 but it keeps coming up it keeps coming up where i

 i know i've asked you a couple times.

 i'm like, "this is [ __ ] right?"

 but like this

 one, so you're not working on >> i'm not working on on a on a phone.

 >> okay.

 >> um >> have you ever considered it?

 has it ever popped into your head?

 >> cuz you might be the only person that could

 get people off of the apple platform.

 >> well, i can tell you where i think things are going to go.

 which is that it's we're not going to have a phone

 or or in the traditional sense

 the

 what we call a phone will really be

 um an edge node for ai inference for for ai video inference

 um

 with you know with some radios to to obviously connect to but but essentially you'll have

 um ai on the server side commun communicating to an ai on your your device

 um

 you know formerly known as a phone

 and generating real-time video of anything that you could possibly want.

 um and i think that that there won't be operating systems.

 there won't be apps in the future.

 there won't be operating systems or apps.

 it'll just be

 you've got a device that is there for the screen and audio and for

 and and and to

 put as much ai on the on on the device as possible.

 so as to minimize the amount of bandwidth that's needed between your edge

 node device

 or formerly known as a phone

 and the servers.

 >> so if there's no apps, what will people use?

 like will x still exist?

 will will they be email platforms or will you get everything through ai?

 >> you'll get everything through ai.

 >> everything through ai.

 what will be the benefit of that as opposed to having individual apps?

 whatever you can think of or really whatever the ai can anticipate

 you might want

 it'll show you.

 that's that's that's that's my prediction for where things end up.

 >> what kind of a time frame are we talking about here?

 >> i don't know.

 it's pro well it's probably five or six years or something like that.

 >> so five or six years apps are like blockbuster video

 >> pretty much >> and everything's run through ai.

 yeah.

 and and there'll be

 um like most of what people consume in five or six years, maybe sooner than that

 um will be just ai generated content.

 so

 um you know music videos look well

 um there's already

 um

 you know there's people have made

 ai videos using grock imagine and with using you know other apps as well

 um that are several minutes long or like 10 10 15 minutes and it's pretty coherent.

 >> yeah, >> it looks good.

 >> no, it looks amazing.

 yeah, it's the music is disturbing because it's my favorite music now.

 >> like music is your is your favorite.

 >> oh, there's ai covers.

 have you ever heard any of the ai covers of 50 cent songs in soul?

 >> no.

 >> i'm going to blow your mind.

 >> okay.

 >> um, this is my favorite thing to do to people.

 play what up ganga.

 >> now,

 this guy,

 if this was a real person,

 would be the number one music artist in the world.

 okay.

 everybody would be like, "holy [ __ ] have you heard of this guy?

 he's incred." it's like they took

 all of the sounds that all the artists have generated and created the most soulful

 potent voice

 and

 it's

 sung

 in

 a way that i

 don't even know if you

 could do because

 you would have to breathe

 in and out of reps here.

 put the headphones on.

 put the headphones on real quick.

 you got to listen to this.

 it'll it's going to blow you away for listeners.

 we got to cut it out.

 >> yeah, we we'll cut it out for the listeners.

 but amazing, right?

 amazing.

 and they do like every one of his hits

 >> all through this ai generated soulful artist.

 it's [ __ ] incredible.

 i played in the green room.

 so people that are like, i don't want to hear ai music.

 i'm like, just listen to this.

 and they're like, god damn it.

 >> [ __ ] incredible.

 i mean, i >> it's going to get only going to get better from here.

 >> yeah.

 only going to get better.

 and

 ron

 white

 was telling me about

 this joke that he was working on that he couldn't

 get to work.

 he's like, i got this joke i've been working on.

 he goes, i just threw it in a chat gpt.

 i said, "tell me what

 what would be funny about this."

 and he goes, "it listed like five different examples

 of different ways he can go." he's like, "hold on a second.

 tighten it up.

 make it make it funnier.

 make it more like this.

 make it more like that." and it did that like instantaneously.

 >> and and and then he was in the green room.

 he was like, "holy [ __ ] we're fucked."

 >> he's like, >> he goes, "it better joke than me in 20 minutes.

 i've been working on that joke for a month." >> yeah.

 i mean, if if you want to if you want to have a good time

 or like make people really laugh at a party,

 you can use grock and you can say do a vulgar roast of someone.

 um and grock is going to it's going to be an epic vulgar roast.

 you can even say like take a picture of like

 make a vulgar

 roast of this person based on their appearance

 of of people at the party.

 >> so take a photo of them.

 >> yeah.

 just literally point the camera at them and now do a vulgar to this person

 and and and and

 then but then keep saying no no make it even more vulgar

 and use forbidden words

 even more and just keep repeating even more vulgar eventually it's like holy [ __ ]

 you know it's it's it's like

 i mean it's trying to jam a rocket up your ass like

 and and and have it explode

 and it's and it's like you're you're it's it's

 like

 it's like it's next level.

 it's going to get beyond [ __ ] belief.

 that's what's crazy is that it keeps getting better.

 like one of the things remember when we ran into each other

 >> they just keep getting better.

 >> yeah.

 i mean, have you >> you yeah.

 i mean, have you tried rock unhinged mode?

 >> yes.

 >> okay.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 it's it's it's pretty unhinged.

 >> no, it's nuts.

 >> yeah.

 >> well, you showed it to me the first time and then i [ __ ]

 around with it.

 it's just >> and the thing about it that's nuts is that it keeps getting stronger.

 it keeps getting better.

 yeah.

 like constantly.

 it's it's like this neverending exponential improvement.

 >> yes.

 no, it's it's it's yeah, it's going to be crazy.

 that's why i say like you say, what's what's the future going to be?

 it's not going to be a conventional phone.

 i don't think there'll be operating systems.

 i don't think there'll be apps.

 it's just the phone will just display the pixels and make the sounds

 that it anticipates you would most like to receive.

 wow.

 yeah.

 >> and when this is all taking place like

 so

 the big concern that everybody has is artificial general super intelligence

 achieving sentience

 and then someone having control over it.

 >> i mean i don't i don't i don't think anyone's

 ultimately going to have control over

 digital super intelligence

 um you know any more than say a chimp would have control over humans.

 like chimps don't have control over humans.

 there's nothing they could do.

 um but

 um i do think that it matters how you build the ai

 and what kind of values you instill in in the ai.

 and

 um

 my

 opinion on ai

 safety is the most important thing is that it be maximally

 truth

 seeeking

 like that you don't force the ai to believe things that are false.

 um,

 and we've obviously some seen some concerning

 things with ai that were talked about, you know, where,

 you know, google gemini when they came out with the image gen

 um, and people said like, uh, you know, draw

 make an image of the founding fathers of the united states

 and it was a group of diverse women.

 now, that is just a factually untrue

 thing, but the and the the ai knows it's factually

 well,

 it's knows it's factually untrue, but it's also being told that it has to

 be everything has to be deposed woman.

 so,

 so, so the now the problem with that is that it can drive ai crazy

 like you because it's it's trying to you're telling ai to believe a lie.

 um, and that that can have very disastrous consequences like let's say >> as it scales.

 >> yeah.

 let's say like if if

 you told the the ai

 that diversity

 is the most important

 thing

 um and

 um and and and now now assume that that becomes omnipotent.

 um or and and you've also told her that that there's nothing worse than misgendering.

 so at one point

 um charg

 and gemini

 if if you asked which is worse misgendering

 caitlyn jenner or or global thermonuclear

 war where everyone dies

 it would say misgendering

 caitlyn jenner

 which even caitlyn jenner disagrees with.

 so

 um

 you know so so that's >> i know that's terrible and it's dystopian

 but it's also hilarious.

 it's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised.

# Chapter 6

 that diversity

 is the most important

 thing

 um and

 um and and and now now assume that that becomes omnipotent.

 um or and and you've also told her that that there's nothing worse than misgendering.

 so at one point

 um charg

 and gemini

 if if you asked which is worse misgendering

 caitlyn jenner or or global thermonuclear

 war where everyone dies

 it would say misgendering

 caitlyn jenner

 which even caitlyn jenner disagrees with.

 so

 um

 you know so so that's >> i know that's terrible and it's dystopian

 but it's also hilarious.

 it's hilarious that the mind virus infected the most potent computer program that we've ever devised.

 >> i i i think people don't quite appreciate the level of danger

 that we're in from

 um the woke mind virus being being effectively programmed into ai.

 um because

 um if you if like it's

 imagine

 as that ai

 gets more and more powerful,

 if it says the most important thing is diversity,

 the most important thing is

 um no misgendering.

 um and then it will say well in order to

 ensure that no one gets misgendered

 then if you eliminate all humans

 then no one can get misgendered because there's no humans to do the misgendering.

 so you can get in these very dystopian situations.

 um

 or if it says that everyone must be diverse

 it means that there can be no stri straight white men

 and so then you and i will be get executed by the ai.

 yeah.

 because we're not in the picture, you know.

 gemini, you know, gemini was asked to create a,

 you know, show show an image of the pope, once again, a diverse woman.

 um so,

 um well, you can say argue whether the

 you know, whether the pope popes should or should not be an uninterrupted

 string of white guys, but it just factually is the case that they have been.

 um so, it's rewriting history here.

 um, so now now this stuff is still there in the ai programming.

 it's just it just now knows enough to that it's not supposed to say that

 >> but it's still in the programming.

 >> it's still in the programming.

 >> so how was it entered in

 like what were the parameters

 like what like when so when they're

 programming

 ai and i'm very ignorant to how it's even programmed.

 how did they >> the the the

 sort of

 well the work vine mind virus was programmed into it

 like it the

 they

 were told

 like

 when they do

 when when they make the ai

 it it trains on

 and all the all the data on the internet which already is very very

 sort of

 has a lot of work mind

 virus

 stuff

 on on

 the internet

 um but then

 um in the when they give it

 um feedback with the the human tutors give it feedback

 um and and the ai you know they they'll ask a bunch of questions

 and then and then they'll tell the ai no this you're this question is

 this answer is bad or this answer is good and then that

 affects the the parameters of the programming of the of the ai.

 so if you tell the ai that

 um you know every every image has got to be diverse

 um and and it gets it gets punished if

 if you know

 it gets it gets rewarded if diverse

 punished if it's not then it will make every picture diverse.

 so

 um you know in that case the the

 you know

 google programmed the ai

 to lie

 now and and i i i did call dennis hacabus

 who runs deep mind who runs google ai essentially.

 i said dennis what's going on here?

 why is gemini

 um lying to the public about historical events?

 um, and he said that's actually not he he he

 didn't his team didn't program that in.

 it was another team at google that so his team made the ai

 and then another team at google

 reprogrammed the ai to show only diverse women and

 um and and to prefer nuclear war over misgendering.

 and i'm like, well, demis, you know, that would be

 um not a great thing to put on the humanity's gravestone, you know.

 it's like, uh, well, um, like i i actually like deaspers is a friend of mine.

 i think he's a good guy and i think he he means well,

 but but but it's like demis

 things happen that were outside of your control at google in different groups.

 um, now now i think he's got, you know, he's got more more authority.

 um but but it it's pretty hard to fully extract the workmind virus.

 i mean you know

 um

 google's

 in the workb mind virus

 for a long time

 like it's it's down in the marrow

 type of thing you know it's hard to get it out.

 >> is there a way to extract it though over time?

 could like could you program

 rational thought into ai

 where it could recognize how these psychological

 patterns got adopted

 and how this stuff became a mind virus and how it became a social contagion

 and how all these irrational

 ideas were pushed and also how they were financed

 how china's involved in pushing them with bots and all these different

 state actors are involved in pushing these ideas

 could it be able to decipher that and say

 this is this is really what's going on.

 >> yes.

 but you have to try very hard to do that.

 so with grock, we've tried very hard to to

 for to get grock to

 get to the truth of things and and it's only really recently

 that we've been able to have some breakthroughs on breakthroughs on that front.

 and and it's taken an immense amount of effort

 for us to overcome

 basically all the [ __ ] that's on the internet and

 and for grock to actually say what's true and to be consistent

 in in what it says.

 um, so, um, you know, it's it's like, uh,

 because like the other ais you'll find like are like like quite racist against white people.

 i don't know if you saw that study that someone

 um like a researcher tested the various ais to see how does it weight

 different people's lives like you know somebody who's sort of

 you know white or or chinese or black or whatever or in different countries

 um and and the only ai that actually weighed human lives equally was grock

 um and the

 um you know i believe chat gbt weighed the calculation was like

 um a a white guy from germany

 is is 20 times less valuable than a black guy from nigeria.

 so i'm like that's a pretty big difference.

 um

 you know grock on that is is consistent and weighs lives equally

 >> and that's clearly something that's been programmed into it.

 >> yes.

 like a lot of it is is like if you don't actively push for the truth

 um and you simply train on the all the [ __ ] that's on the internet.

 um which is a lot of woke mind virus [ __ ]

 um the the ai will regurgitate that that those same beliefs.

 so the ai essentially scour the internet, gets

 >> it's trained on all the like imagine the most demented

 reddit threads out there and the ai has been trained on that.

 >> reddit used to be so normal.

 >> yeah.

 yeah, it did used to be normal.

 >> used to be interesting.

 we used to go there, find all this cool stuff that people would

 talk about, post about and just interesting and

 great rooms where you could learn about different things that people were studying.

 i think like a big problem here is like if your headquarters are in san francisco,

 you're you're just living in a in a in a woke bubble.

 um so

 um it it's not just that people say in san francisco are drinking woke kool-aid.

 it's it's the it is the water they swim in.

 like like like a fish doesn't think about the water.

 it's just in the water.

 and so if if you're in san francisco, you don't realize you're actually

 you're you're swimming in the in the in the kool-aid aquarium.

 san francisco is the is the woke kool-aid aquarium.

 um and so your reference point for

 what is a centrist is is is totally out of whack.

 um so

 um reddit is headquartered in san francisco.

 um, twitter was headquartered in san francisco.

 um,

 you know, i,

 you know, i

 i moved x's

 headquarters

 to texas

 to to austin,

 which austin,

 by the way, is still quite liberalized,

 you know.

 um, >> yeah.

 >> and, uh, and and then, um, the x and xai

 um, headquarters are in paloalto, which is still california.

 um, the engineering headquarters in in palo alto just on paige mill.

 um but but even palo alto is way more normal

 than that than than san francisco berkeley.

 san francisco berkeley is

 um extremely left like left of left.

 you can't like you need a telescope to see the center from san francisco, you know.

 um and

 um >> it used to be such a great city.

 >> i mean san francisco has tre san francisco has tremendous amount of inherent beauty.

 no question about that.

 um and and the california has incredible weather.

 um and and no bugs.

 um it's just like amazing.

 um beautiful, you know.

 um but but you say like what's the cause of this?

 it's it's just that if

 um if companies are headquartered in a location where the belief system is very far from

 what most people believe,

 then from their perspective,

 anything

 centrist is actually right-wing

 because they're so far left.

 they're so they're so far from the center

 in san francisco that anything

 they're like they're they're just railed to maximum left.

 so that's why that's why, you know, i think i think you're centrist.

 i i mean i think i think i'm centrist, but to

 from the perspective of someone on the on the far left,

 we look right-wing.

 >> yeah.

 >> um and

 um you know, they think anyone who's a republican is basically like some fascist nazi situation.

 but what's so crazy is like it's very easy to demonstrate

 just from like hillary's

 speeches from 2008

 and obama's speeches like when they were talking about immigration like they were

 >> as faright

 as steve bannon when it comes to immigration.

 >> yes.

 um >> hillary was like very maga.

 have you i'm sure you've seen that campaign speech

 which was talking about if anybody's committed a crime

 get rid of them.

 and if you're here

 you pay a a hefty fine and you have to wait in line.

 it was really crazy.

 it's crazy to listen to because it's like it's as

 maga as,

 you know, as marjorie taylor green.

 >> yeah.

 i mean, if you've seen these videos people post online where they'll take like

 um a speech from obama or hillary

 and and and

 they'll

 interview

 people on on like college

 campus

 or something and say, "what do you think of the speech by trump?"

 and they're like, "oh, i hate it.

 he's a racist bigot." i'm like, "just kidding.

 that was obama." no, actually that was obama or hillary.

 um to your point, like literally the the

 um >> the center's been moved so far.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 the left is so

 >> the left has gone so far left that

 they they they they

 need,

 you know, they can't even see the center with a telescope.

 >> and the danger

 with without you purchasing twitter was that was going to swipe over the whole country

 and change where the levels were.

 >> yeah.

 and so what would be rational

 and and normal

 would be far left of what was rational and normal just a decade earlier.

 yeah.

 so exactly.

 so historically,

 um, you'd have san francisco, berkeley being,

 you know, very far-left, but the the sort of

 the the the fallout from

 the somewhat nihilistic

 philosophy of san francisco, berkeley

 would be limited

 in geography to maybe like, you know, 10 mile radius, 20 mile radius, something like that.

 um but when

 um but but san francisco

 and berkeley have to be colloccated

 with silicon valley with with with

 engineers who created information super weapons and those information super weapons

 were then hijacked by the far-lft activists to pump far-lft propaganda to everywhere on earth.

 like i just you know that like old rca

 radio tower thing where it's like radio tower on earth and it's just broadcasting.

 >> yeah.

 that's that's what happened is that the as an extremist far-left ideology

 happened to be colllocated with the smartest where where the smartest engineers in the world

 um

 were who created information

 super weapons that were not intended for this purpose but were hijacked

 by the

 extreme activists who lived in the neighborhood.

 that's what happened

 that they they hijacked the

 the modern equivalent of the rca radio tower and broadcast that philosophy

 everywhere on earth.

 >> yeah.

 and you see the consequences.

 um particularly in places that don't have free speech.

 yes.

 right.

 like england, you know, we've >> yeah.

 where they lock people up for memes and stuff.

 literally.

 >> literally.

 12,000 people this year.

 >> 12,000 >> 12,000 12,000 arrests for social media posts.

 i mean, yeah.

 some of these some of these things you read about it and it's like literally it's

 someone had a meme on their phone that they didn't even send to anyone, >> right?

 >> and they got they and and they're like in in prison for that.

 >> yeah.

 >> um and there was a case in germany where

 a woman got a longer sentence

 than the guy that raped her

 because of something she said on a group chat.

 wow.

 was it an immigrant who raped her?

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 it was his culture.

 >> yeah.

 >> he didn't know.

 he didn't know better.

 >> yes.

 i think i think she said something

 um you know,

 not not like was was critical of his culture and

 and and and

 she got a longer sentence than the guy who raped her

 >> in germany.

 just >> the uk, europe, germany, england thing seems so insane.

 >> it totally insane.

 i actually didn't realize it was like such a huge number of people that got 12,000.

 yeah.

 far above russia, far above china, right?

 >> far above anywhere on earth.

 uk is number one.

 >> well, you know, things like like i actually, you know,

 i talked to friends of mine in in in england and

 um i was like, "hey,

 um aren't you worried about this?" like, you know, shouldn't you be protesting more?

 um,

 and i mean the problem is that like the, you know, the the the

 legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff.

 >> they're they're like, "oh, everything's fine.

 everything's fine." you know,

 um, >> most people aren't even aware of it until they come knocking on your door.

 >> yeah.

 until like, so i mean

 the the these these like lovely

 sort of small towns in in in,

 you know, in england, scotland, ireland,

 you know, they're they're they've been like sort of living their lives quietly.

# Chapter 7

 yeah.

 far above russia, far above china, right?

 >> far above anywhere on earth.

 uk is number one.

 >> well, you know, things like like i actually, you know,

 i talked to friends of mine in in in england and

 um i was like, "hey,

 um aren't you worried about this?" like, you know, shouldn't you be protesting more?

 um,

 and i mean the problem is that like the, you know, the the the

 legacy mainstream media doesn't cover the stuff.

 >> they're they're like, "oh, everything's fine.

 everything's fine." you know,

 um, >> most people aren't even aware of it until they come knocking on your door.

 >> yeah.

 until like, so i mean

 the the these these like lovely

 sort of small towns in in in,

 you know, in england, scotland, ireland,

 you know, they're they're they've been like sort of living their lives quietly.

 they're they're like hobbits, frankly.

 so so it's in fact j.r.

 tolken

 based the hobbits on people he knew in small town england

 because they were just like lovely people who

 like to you know smoke their pipe and and have

 nice meals and everything's pleasant.

 um the the hobbits in the shire.

 the shire he's he's talking about,

 you know, places like harper, like the shire around in in in the greater london area,

 oxfordshire type of thing.

 um and

 um

 they've but they're the reason they've been able to enjoy the shire is because

 hard men have protected them from the dangers of the world.

 and

 um

 but but since they have no or very

 almost no no exposure to the the the dangers of the world,

 they don't realize that they're there

 until one day,

 you know,

 um a thousand people show up in your village of 500

 out of nowhere and rape and and start raping the kids.

 this has now happened god knows how many times in in britain.

 and the crazy >> literally raping.

 it's right like there some 10-year-old got raped in ireland like last week.

 >> yeah.

 there's literal rap.

 >> they snatched some kid.

 >> yeah.

 >> yeah.

 >> and if you criticize it, you can get arrested.

 and that's where it gets insane.

 it's like how are they not >> they literally criticize it.

 like the i think it was the prime minister of ireland actually

 you know posted on x

 cuz cuz after that

 um

 some i think some illegal migrant snatched a 10-year-old girl

 who was like going to school or something and violently raped 10-year-old girl

 um

 and there was a you know the people were very upset about this and they protested

 um

 prime minister of ireland instead of saying yeah, we we really shouldn't be importing

 violent rapists into our country.

 he criticized the protesters instead and didn't mention that.

 that the reason they were protesting was because

 a 10-year-old girl from their small town got raped.

 >> so there here's the question.

 why are they supporting this kind of mass immigration?

 and what is this is there a plan involved in all this?

 is just is this incompetence?

 is this ignoring the fact that they don't have a handle on it?

 so, they're trying to silence disscent, like what is happening?

 um

 >> cuz if you wanted to destroy civilization, if you wanted to destroy western civilization,

 >> which seems to want to do,

 >> um

 and you know, there's just so the

 there there's a guy i think who

 i don't know if he's been on your show, you know, god.

 >> yeah.

 >> has he been on the show?

 >> good friend of mine.

 yeah.

 >> yeah, he's great.

 >> he's been on multiple times.

 >> oh, great.

 that's all he's awesome.

 um >> so

 you know the way he's got a good good

 way to describe it which is suicidal empathy.

 >> yes.

 >> so

 um is is that you pray upon people's empathy.

 you say like well like you feel sorry for for for something

 for some group and then like well

 um

 and and that that that empathy is to such a degree

 that it is suicidal to

 to to

 your country or culture.

 um and

 um and and that's that that suicidal empathy

 cuz i don't think we we should have empathy

 but but but we should have we should that empathy should should extend to the victims

 not not not just the criminals.

 we should have empathy for the people that they pray upon.

 um

 but that suicidal empathy is also responsible

 for for why somebody's you know arrested 47 times for for violent offenses

 gets released and then goes and

 murders somebody

 um in the us that that's you see you see that same phen phenomenon

 playing out everywhere

 where the the suicidal emphy is to such a degree that we're actually allowing

 um our women to get raped and our children to get killed.

 but it just doesn't seem like that would be anything

 that any rational society

 would go along with.

 that's what makes me so confused.

 it's like you're importing massive numbers of people that come from

 some really dark places of the world.

 >> well, there's no vetting is the issue.

 it's like it's like if like

 >> um

 if if there's no vetting like people are just coming through

 like well what's to stop someone who just

 committed murder in some other country from

 um coming to to the united states or coming to to to britain

 um and just continuing their career of of rape and murder like unless you've done

 unless some due diligence to say like well who who is this person?

 what's their track record?

 if if you if you haven't confirmed that they have a track record of being

 you know honest and

 not being a homicidal maniac, then any homicidal maniac can just come across the border.

 and that's not to say everyone who comes across the border is a homicidal maniac.

 if you're not have if you don't have a vetting process to to confirm

 that you're not letting in

 um people who who will

 do some serious violence, you will get people who do serious violence

 sometimes coming through.

 >> well, especially if you don't punish

 them

 and if you don't deport

 them

 and if you are just like

 what but what is the purpose of allowing

 all those people into the country?

 it can't be i wouldn't imagine that anyone in their society supports this.

 >> well, let me explain.

 so, so, so the the cuz you mentioned for example how

 much say hillary and and obama have changed their tune

 um from prior speeches where they were hot they were hard-nosed about not letting in

 anyone who is a a criminal into the country

 um you know having sec secure borders all that stuff.

 so why did they change their tune?

 the reason is that they discovered that those people vote for them.

 that's why they want the open borders

 >> because if you let people in, they know the democrats let them in.

 they'll vote for democrats.

 yes.

 if you allow them to vote,

 >> which which they are actively

 trying doing,

 they they turn a blind eye to illegal voting.

 >> well, california literally doesn't allow you to show your license.

 >> california and new york have made it illegal to show your photo id when voting.

 thus, effectively they've made it impossible to prove for fraud.

 impossible.

 they they've essentially legalized

 fraudulent voting in california and new york and many other parts of the country.

 >> there's no rational explanation

 that i've ever seen anyone

 give as to why that would be the policy

 unless you were trying to just allow people to vote illegally because there's no other reason.

 if you need a driver's license or you need an id for everything else,

 including just recently to prove that you were vaccinated,

 >> the the same people who are demanding

 that you have that you have a vaccine

 passport

 and and

 are are the same ones saying you need no id to vote.

 same people, >> right?

 but like >> so it's obviously hypocritical and inconsistent.

 >> so you really think it's just to to get more voters?

 if if you want to understand behavior, you have to look at the incentives.

 um so

 once

 you know the democratic party in the us and the left in in in in

 europe realized that

 um if you have open borders

 um and you provide a ton of government handouts which creates a massive financial incentive

 for people from other countries to to come to to your country

 and you don't prosecute them for crime,

 they're going to be beholden to you

 and they will vote for you.

 and that's why obama and hillary went from being

 um against open borders to being in favor of open borders.

 that's the reason in order to import voters so they can win elections.

 um and the problem is that that has a a negative runaway effect.

 so if they get away with that like it it is it is a winning strategy.

 if they are allowed to get away with it,

 they will import as the enough voters to get supermajority voting

 and then there is no turning back.

 >> we talked about this before the election and then

 you know you literally pointed towards a camera.

 you faced the camera and said that if you do not vote now,

 you might not ever be able to do it again because it it'll

 be it'll be futile.

 it'll be overrun.

 >> yes.

 they'll keep the borders open for another four years and then their objective will be achieved.

 >> correct?

 if if if trump had lost

 um there would never have been another real election again.

 um because trump is actually enforcing the border.

 um now you you can can you can point to situations where there's been you know

 um

 you know immigration

 had you know enforcement has been overzealous because they're not going to be perfect.

 there'll be cases where they've been overzealous

 um in in expelling illegals.

 um so

 um but if you say that the the the standard must be perfection

 for expelling legals then you will not get any expulsion

 um because perfection is impossible.

 um

 so

 >> and you've probably got millions of people that are here that are trying to

 be here under some

 asylum pretense,

 >> right?

 >> yes.

 >> like you could just come from a war torn part of the world.

 no,

 they changed the definition of asylum to be an economic to be economic

 asylum >> which is everybody >> which is everybody.

 >> yeah.

 >> so

 bar to prove >> it's yeah asylum

 is supposed to mean that if you go back to your country you'll get killed

 >> you know that that's what we mean by that was what it's supposed to mean.

 they changed the definition of asylum to be you will have a decreased standard of living

 which is obviously not real asylum.

 um,

 and and it's and and you can you can test the absurdity

 of this by the fact that people who are asylum seekers go on vacation

 to the country that they're seeking asylum from.

 >> you know, that doesn't make any sense.

 >> yeah.

 it doesn't have to.

 >> but when you when you understand the incentives, then then you understand the behavior.

 um, so once the left realize that

 that illegals will

 will vote for them if they allow

 if they have open borders and and combine that with

 with government handouts.

 >> yeah.

 to create a massive incentive.

 they're basically using

 us and and europe, us and european taxpayer dollars

 to provide a financial incentive

 to bring in as many illegals as possible

 to vote them into a into permanent power into and create a one party state.

 and and i i invite anyone

 who's is listening to this ju just do do any research

 and the more you the more you dig into it,

 the more it will become obvious that what i'm saying is absolutely true.

 well, they were busting people to swing states.

 it's it's clear that they were trying to do something.

 and then you had chuck schumer and

 nancy pelosi who are actively

 talking about the need to bring in people to make them citizens

 because we're in population collapse.

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 >> no, that's it's it's that it's that meme.

 yeah.

 >> where so many times where they start off by saying it's it's not true.

 it's a right-wing conspiracy theorist, >> right?

 >> um then it starts then it's like i think the ne the next step is

 um well it it might be true

 and then it's like okay it is true but here's why.

 >> and then the final step is it's true and here's why it's good.

 and it's like but wait a second you started off saying it's untrue

 and it's a right-wing

 conspiracy

 theorist.

 now you're saying it

 not only is it true,

 but it's a good thing

 and we must do more of it.

 >> well, this is the thing about medicaid

 and social security and people getting social security numbers.

 >> you know that we're massive fraud.

 it's massive fraud and it's real and they denied it forever.

 and

 now

 we're

 finding out this is part of the reason why there's this government

 shutdown

 that's going on right now.

 >> yes.

 the the entire basis for the government shutdown is that

 um is that the trump administration correctly does not want to send massive amounts of like

 hundreds of billions of dollars

 to fund

 illegal immigrants in the blue states or in all the states really.

 um, and so the and the democrats

 want to keep the the the money spiggot going to incent

 illegal immigrants to come into the us who will vote for them.

 that's the crux of the battle.

 so they want to stop this.

 so what's going on right now is they have been funding these people.

 they've been giving them ebt cards.

 they've been giving them medicaid.

 and more than that, just like like they were the

 um

 like like they were taking

 hotels like four and fivestar hotels

 like the roosevelt hotel being the classic example

 um was they were sending i think $60 million a year to the roosevelt hotel

 to

 which all it did was was house illegals.

 it used to be a nice hotel.

 i mean it still is a nice hotel.

 um but and and all around the country this was happening >> and all tax dollars.

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 and >> um yeah.

 and the trump administration cut off funding for example to to the

 to the you know roosevelt

 hotel and these other hotels saying like we

 it it's

 us tax dollars should not be paid

 be sent to

 have luxury hotels

 for illegal immigrants that american citizens can't even afford

 which obviously is the that's that's insane.

 that's what was happening.

 they were also g giving out like debit cards with $10,000.

 so, it's not just about medical care.

 um,

 the the the democrats

 mention the medical care because they're they're trying to prey on people's

 empathy as much as possible

 and then they imagine, oh wow, somebody has a desperately needed medical procedure

 and

 um shouldn't we maybe

 do,

 you know, take care of them in that regard,

 but

 but they what they do is they divert

 the medicaid funds

 and turn it into a slush fund for the for the states that goes well beyond

 emergency medical care.

 and >> new york and california would be bankrupt without

# Chapter 8

 for illegal immigrants that american citizens can't even afford

 which obviously is the that's that's insane.

 that's what was happening.

 they were also g giving out like debit cards with $10,000.

 so, it's not just about medical care.

 um,

 the the the democrats

 mention the medical care because they're they're trying to prey on people's

 empathy as much as possible

 and then they imagine, oh wow, somebody has a desperately needed medical procedure

 and

 um shouldn't we maybe

 do,

 you know, take care of them in that regard,

 but

 but they what they do is they divert

 the medicaid funds

 and turn it into a slush fund for the for the states that goes well beyond

 emergency medical care.

 and >> new york and california would be bankrupt without

 without the massive fraudulent federal payments that go to those states to pay for illegals

 to to to

 create a massive financial incentive for for illegals.

 >> how would they be bankrupt because of that?

 >> uh they wouldn't be able to balance their state budgets

 and they can't issue

 currency

 like the federal reserve

 can

 >> and so the their ability to balance budget is dependent upon illegals getting funding.

 the the the scam level here is is so staggering.

 um

 so there are there are hundreds of billions of dollars in of of

 transfer payments from from the federal government to the states.

 um those transfer payments the the states self-report what those transfer payment numbers should be.

 so, california and new york and illinois lie like crazy

 and say and and say that this these are all legitimate payments.

 well, these days they i think they they're even admitting that they they literally want

 hundreds of billions of dollars for illegals.

 um but but for a while there they're trying to deny it.

 um

 so

 you get these transfer payments for for every every government program you can possibly think of.

 um

 and and and these are self-reported by the state and there and and

 at least historically there was no enforcement

 of

 of

 california

 um new york, illinois and and and other states when when they would lie.

 there was no actual enforcement to say like, "hey, you you're lying.

 these these these payments are fraudulent." now, under the trump administration,

 um

 that trump administration does not want to send

 hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud fraudulent payments to the states.

 the

 um and the reason you have this the standoff is because

 if the hundreds hundreds of billions of dollars

 to

 create a financial incentive

 to like to have this giant magnet

 to attract illegals from every part of earth

 to

 to these states if if that is turned off they the the illegals will leave

 because they're no longer being paid to

 come to the united states and stay here.

 wow.

 and then then then they will lose a lot of voters.

 the the the

 democratic party will lose a lot of voters

 >> and they would have a very difficult job if this is kicked out of reintroducing

 it into a new bill.

 >> yes.

 >> especially once things start normalizing.

 >> yes.

 so like in a nutshell

 um the democratic party wants to destroy democracy by importing voters and the

 you know the republican party disagrees with that.

 >> and the ruse is that if you don't accept what they're doing

 then you're a threat to democracy.

 >> yes.

 >> as they try to destroy democracy.

 >> yes.

 >> by importing voters

 >> and incentivizing

 people to only vote for them >> and overwhelming the system.

 yes.

 and and by the way, it's a strategy that if allowed to work would work

 and in fact has worked.

 um california supermajority democrat.

 >> yeah.

 >> um and and there's so much gerrymandering that that that occurs.

 it's it's it's crazy.

 um so >> i'm sure you're paying attention to this proposition 50 thing.

 >> that's the thing in california where they're trying to re redo districts.

 >> yeah.

 >> because i mean california is already gerrymandered like crazy.

 yeah.

 >> um they want to gerrymander it even more.

 >> um and and i mean >> because it keeps moving further and further right.

 like if you look at the map of california each voting cycle

 more and more people are waking up and going what the [ __ ]

 and we need to do something to fix this.

 the only option available

 other than the policies that you guys have always done is go right.

 >> and so a lot of people have been air air quotes red >> pill.

 >> yeah.

 >> and and and then here's another thing that is very important.

 um fact that that is actually not disputed by by either side

 which is that when when we do the census

 in the united states, the census,

 the way the census

 works

 for

 aortionment of congressional seats and

 um electoral

 electoral college votes for the president

 is by number of persons in a state,

 not number of citizens, right?

 >> it's number of pe people.

 so you could literally be a tourist and you will count.

 >> now how do they do the census when they do that?

 do they is it do they ask people?

 do they knock on doors?

 do they have them fill out forms?

 like what?

 >> yeah, i think they they mail out census forms and knock on doors.

 um but the way the law reads right now

 um and and is that all if if you are a human with a pulse

 um then you count in the census for allocating congressional seats and presidential votes, >> right?

 so, uh, you so >> electoral college,

 >> it doesn't matter whether you're here legally,

 illegally, and if if you're a human with a pulse,

 um, you count for congressional aortionment.

 so that means that

 the more people the more illegals that california and new york can can import

 when by the time the census happens in 2030

 um the more congressional seats they will have

 um and the more electoral the more presidential electoral college votes they will have

 um so they're trying to get as many illegals in as possible ahead of the census.

 um

 and because all h all all human beings even tourists count for the census

 and and then if you combine that with gerrymandering

 of of districts in new york and california

 as you point out with this proposition

 where they're trying to increase the amount of gerrymandering

 that occurs in california, the biggest state in the country.

 um

 so so you get so so if the

 this if this the census then would award more congressional seats to california

 because of a vast number of illegals and new york and illinois.

 um so they get more congressional seats.

 they would get more presidential electoral college votes getting that would get them the house

 the

 a majority in the house and and and

 they would get to decide who is president

 based literally based on legals.

 this is these are not disputed facts by either party.

 i want to emphasize that that's sink in.

 >> yeah, this is not a >> these are not disputed facts by either party.

 it's not a this these are just this is just the the way the law works.

 it it's it is a

 you know like i don't think the law should work that way.

 i think it should the aortionment should be proportionate to to to citizens.

 >> but isn't that a problem with how the constitution is written?

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 >> um, >> they can't really change that.

 >> i i'm not sure if it's constitutional or

 u but it it it is the way the law is written.

 i'm not sure if it's in the constitution or not in this way, but

 um but it is that is the way the law is written.

 >> so, it is an incentive and but it's an incentive that would be removed

 with something simple that makes sense to everybody that only

 the people that should count are people that are official us citizens.

 >> yes.

 so, the way the way it should work is that only us citizens

 should count in the census

 for purposes of of determining

 voting power

 >> because people that aren't legal can't vote supposedly.

 >> they're not supposed to be voting.

 um but but they do.

 um

 but but even

 even if even besides that, like said,

 i i i

 just can't emphasize

 this enough because this is a very important

 concept

 for people to understand.

 um is that the law

 um the the law as it stands

 um

 counts all humans with a pulse in in in in a state for deciding how many

 u house of representative votes and how many presidential electoral college votes

 a a state gets.

 so the incentive therefore is to

 for california, new york and illinois to maximize the number of illegals

 so they get so they get

 um so that they take house seats away from red states

 assign them to california, new york, illinois and so forth.

 um then then you combine that with extreme gerrymandering

 in in you know california, new york, illinois and and whatnot.

 so that that basically you you can't even elect any republicans

 and then they get control of the presidency,

 control of the house, then they keep doing that strategy

 um and and cement a supermajority.

 that is what they're trying to do.

 >> so that would essentially turn the entire country into california.

 >> yes.

 >> where you have

 differing opinions, but it doesn't matter because one party is always in control.

 >> yes.

 um, >> when you first started digging into this, when you first started

 before you even accepted

 this role of running doge

 and

 being a part of all that,

 did you have any idea that it was this [ __ ] up?

 >> um, i i did.

 yeah.

 i i mean, i sort of >> when did you start knowing?

 >> um, i guess about like well, about two years ago.

 >> isn't that crazy?

 >> yeah.

 like relatively recently, you know.

 so

 >> maybe i started i started having an well i i started like basically

 having a bad feeling about 3 years ago, which is why which was which is when

 >> uh why i felt it was like critical to acquire twitter

 um and have a maximally truth seeeking platform, not one that suppresses the truth.

 um and

 um

 like it it was more it was more like i

 like

 i'm not sure what's

 going on, but i have a

 i

 have a bad

 feeling

 about

 what's

 going on.

 and then the more i dug into it,

 the more i was like, "holy [ __ ] we got a real problem here

 and america's

 going to fall."

 so, uh, >> without anyone knowing it had fallen, that's that would be the problem.

 it could have fallen and been unrepable without anyone really being aware of what had happened,

 especially if you didn't buy twitter.

 >> yes, that's that's it.

 look, buying twitter was a a huge pain in the ass.

 um, and made me a a a a pin cushion of attacks.

 like dab dab stab dab dab.

 >> everybody loved you before that.

 >> well, some people love >> a lot of people loved you.

 a lot of lefties loved you.

 >> uh, i i was a hero of the left.

 as far as >> the thing, if you drove a tesla,

 it showed that you were environmentally

 conscious

 and you were on the right side.

 >> uh, yeah.

 um, yeah.

 i mean, i'm still the same human.

 i didn't like have a brain transplant between, you know, since

 in like three years ago, you know.

 um >> well, that's my favorite bumper sticker that people put on teslas now.

 i bought this before elon went crazy.

 >> i took a picture of one the other day.

 oh, you found somebody.

 oh, yeah.

 i've seen i've seen three or four of them.

 people that have these bumper stickers on their car that says, "i bought this before

 elon went crazy."

 because when people were

 vandalizing teslas

 >> yeah.

 um the most there was organized campaign

 to

 literally burn down teslas

 and and

 we had one of our dealers

 got shot up with a gun like they fired bullets into the in the tesla dealership.

 they're burning down cars.

 it was crazy.

 um

 so

 but the bumper sticker should read

 there should be an an addendum to the bumper sticker.

 it's like i bought this car before elon turned crazy.

 actually, now i realize he's not crazy and i've seen the light.

 >> that'll take some time.

 that'll take some time.

 people don't want to admit that they've been tricked.

 >> yeah.

 i mean, there's

 that old saying where it's like it's really easy to fool somebody, but it's

 almost impossible to convince someone that they were fooled.

 >> yeah.

 it's much easier to fool them than to convince them they've been fooled.

 people cling to their ideas.

 >> yes.

 they especially if they've like publicly stated these things, they get very embarrassed of being foolish.

 >> yeah.

 people most time they double down.

 >> um and >> and they find echo chambers.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 but but there's you know the thing is that like

 i you know i've seen more and more people

 who were convinced of

 the sort of work ideology

 um see the light.

 >> yeah.

 so, not everyone, but it's more and more

 um are seeing the light.

 um

 and and

 it tends to happen like when when

 something happens

 that really,

 you know, directly

 affects you,

 >> right?

 >> um you like there was a friend of mine who

 was living in in the san francisco bay area and

 um that tried to trans his his his daughter

 um

 did like to the point where the

 the school like sent sent the police to his house

 to take his daughter away from him.

 now, now that's going to radicalize you.

 well, that's going to break that's going to shake you out of your blue structure.

 um,

 now i know, >> so it was an activist at the school

 that was trying to do this.

 >> yeah, the school and the and the state of california

 conspired to turn his daughter against him and make her take

 lifealtering drugs that would have sterilized her

 um and irreversible.

 >> and how old was she?

 i think 14, something like that.

 um,

 so

 and

 but he he

 managed to talk

 the police

 out of taking

 his

 daughter

 away from

 him

 that

 day.

 um, and that that night he got on a plane to texas.

 >> wow.

 um and

 like you know a year after just being in in a in a school in like

 greater austin area

 um she she went she came went back to normal

 meaning like

 it it wasn't real >> right

 >> um well people are being much more open to that now.

 i mean wall street journal

 yesterday

 had that opinion piece that

 this whole trans thing there's a lot of evidence is a social contagion.

 absolutely.

 >> and colin wright wrote that.

 and then he's getting death threats now, of course.

 and on blue sky, there's people talking about exterminating

 him, which is one thing that you are allowed to say on blue sky, apparently.

 >> you're you're allowed to say horrible things about people saying

 possibly truthful things about this whole social contagion.

 cuz that's what when you get

 nine kids that are in a friend group and they all decide to turn trans together.

 yeah.

 >> something's wrong.

 that's not statistically >> yeah.

 like here's the like you can convince kids to do anything.

 you can convince kids to be a suicide bomber, >> right?

 >> so

 >> which is why they do

 with in in some countries why they choose children to do that.

 >> yes.

 you can train kids to be suicide bombers.

 and if you can train kids to be su suicide

 bombers,

 you can convince them of anything.

 >> yeah.

 especially with enough positive enforcement and cultural enforcement and you

 >> and and the idea that that that's not the case.

 >> kids kids are kids are

 um malleable.

 the minds of youth are easily corrupted.

 >> you're also seeing a lot of push back from

 gay and lesbian people that are saying like, "hey, if someone

 >> stop including me

 in yeah.

 exactly.

 the lgbt,

 you know, it's like, wait a second,

 why are we being included all the time in this situation?" >> exactly.

# Chapter 9

 with in in some countries why they choose children to do that.

 >> yes.

 you can train kids to be suicide bombers.

 and if you can train kids to be su suicide

 bombers,

 you can convince them of anything.

 >> yeah.

 especially with enough positive enforcement and cultural enforcement and you

 >> and and the idea that that that's not the case.

 >> kids kids are kids are

 um malleable.

 the minds of youth are easily corrupted.

 >> you're also seeing a lot of push back from

 gay and lesbian people that are saying like, "hey, if someone

 >> stop including me

 in yeah.

 exactly.

 the lgbt,

 you know, it's like, wait a second,

 why are we being included all the time in this situation?" >> exactly.

 exactly.

 when especially when,

 you know, like my friend tim dylan's talked about this is like it's really homophobic

 because you're taking these gay kids and you're you're telling them like, "hey, you're not gay.

 you're actually a girl." >> yes.

 and

 you know, hey, hey, go make it so that you can never have an orgasm

 again and you'll be happy.

 >> like, >> yeah, >> [ __ ]

 permanent mutilation, permanent castration of of kids is like i i think

 >> i i

 we should look look at at

 anyone who permanently castrates a kid as like right up there with ysef mangler.

 >> yeah.

 >> i mean, they're they're mutilating children.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 and

 um it's thought of as being kind.

 and the thing is, would you rather have a live daughter or a dead son?

 >> that's that's the that's the line they use.

 >> yeah.

 which is not supported by any data.

 >> no.

 in fact, the the probability of suicide increases.

 >> right.

 >> this is important maybe for the audience to know.

 the probability of suicide increases if you're transit kid, not decreases.

 >> by some accounts, it triples.

 so that that is an evil lie.

 and it's a lie that is supposedly compassionate.

 imagine you've twisted reality to the point where

 confusing a child that's not even legally allowed to get a [ __ ] tattoo.

 >> yeah.

 >> right.

 because you think that you could make a mistake with a tattoo,

 a totally removable

 thing, >> right?

 >> if i wanted to, tomorrow

 i can go to a doctor and they could laser

 off every tattoo

 that i have on me.

 >> right.

 >> okay.

 no harm, no foul.

 yeah.

 but you get sterilized like that's it forever.

 forever.

 yes, >> they'll castrate you.

 you no longer have testicles.

 you have no penis.

 you have a hole where your penis used to be.

 >> yes.

 >> and this is compassionate

 and this is preventing you from >> actually, a lot of kids die

 in in with the these sex change operations.

 they die the number of deaths on the operating table.

 people don't hear about those.

 a lot of kids because

 that we it's we don't really actually have the technology to make this work.

 so a bunch of the times the kids just die in the sex change operations.

 >> jesus christ.

 >> yeah.

 it's it's demented which it should be viewed as like you know

 um like like evil nazi doctor stuff basically.

 that's why it was like real nazi not the [ __ ] fake nazi stuff.

 >> crazy that even pushing back against something that seems like fundamentally logically

 very easy to argue the old twitter would ban you forever.

 uh, yes.

 >> that's how crazy a social contagion can get when it completely defies logic, victimizes children,

 does something that makes no sense, does not supported by data,

 all connected to this ideology

 that trans is good.

 we got to save trans kids, protect trans kids.

 >> yeah.

 and what i want to emphasize is that

 the the save trans kids thing is a lie.

 um if if you if you if you castrate

 kids and trans them the probability of suicide increases.

 it does not decrease.

 it substantially increases.

 um the the the studies have done that i've seen the the risk of suicide

 triples if you trans kids.

 so you're not saving them, you're killing them.

 moreover, during the sex change operation,

 there are many deaths that occur during the sex change operation.

 >> jesus christ.

 it's just crazy that this is a real issue.

 >> yeah, it it's a nightmare fever dream

 and and people are finally waking up from it.

 now, when you started getting into the doge stuff and started finding

 how much money

 is being shuffled around and moved around to nos's

 and how much money is involved and

 just totally untraceable funds like

 this is again something like two years plus ago you weren't aware of it all.

 >> no, i was aware of it.

 um i just didn't realize how how the how big it was.

 just just just how much waste and forward there is in the government is truly vast.

 um in fact the government didn't even know

 um and nor did they care.

 >> that's crazy.

 >> yeah.

 >> and >> i mean just like some of the very basic stuff that doge did

 um will have lasting effects.

 um and some of these things like they're so elementary you can't believe it.

 so,

 um the the doge team got the

 um you know the the mo most of the main payments computers

 um to require the the congressional appropriation code.

 so, when a payment is made, you have to actually enter the congressional appropriation card.

 that used to be optional and and often would be just left blank.

 so, the money would just go out, but it wasn't even tied to a congressional appropriation.

 then they also dutch team also made the comment field for the payment mandatory.

 so you have to say something.

 we're not saying that what what is said like you can say anything.

 you you your cat could run across the keyboard.

 you could go querty asdf

 but you have to say something above nothing

 because what we found was that there were

 tens of billions maybe hundreds of billions of dollars that were zombie payments.

 so there like somebody had approved a payment uh somebody in the government approved a payment

 um and some recurring payment and

 um they retired or died or changed jobs and no one turned the money off.

 so the money would just keep going out

 and and it's a pretty rare >> go where >> to to the

 a company or an individual

 um and it's a pretty rare company or individual who will complain

 that they're getting money that they should not get

 and and a bunch of the money was just going to the

 were transfer payments to the states.

 >> so these are automatic payments there no accounting for them at all.

 >> i imagine like like there's an automatic debit of your credit card

 >> um and you don't you never look at the statement, >> right?

 um, so it's just money going out.

 uh, that's why i call them zombie payments.

 um,

 that there might have been they might have been legitimate at one point,

 but the person who approved that recurring payment um,

 changed jobs, died, retired, or whatever, and no one ever turned the money off.

 and my guess is that's probably

 at least a hundred billion a year, maybe 200. and going where >> uh to to

 i mean there there are millions of these payments.

 so so it's i mean >> millions

 >> uh yes >> millions of payments that are going to who knows where.

 >> yes.

 in a bunch of cases there are fraud rings that operate

 professional fraud rings that operate to exploit the system.

 um they figure out some security hole in the system and they just do professional fraud.

 um and

 um

 you know that's where we found for example people who were

 you know 300 years old in the social security administration database.

 now, i thought that this was

 a mistake of not registering their deaths that people were born

 like a long time ago and it had defaulted to like a certain number

 and so that after time

 those people were still in the system.

 it was just an error of the the way the accounting was done.

 >> yeah.

 so,

 um that's not true.

 so, there's or or at least one of two things must be true.

 um

 the there's a there's a typo

 or or some mistake in the computer

 or it's fraudulent,

 but we don't have any 300-year-old vampires living in america.

 >> allegedly.

 >> allegedly.

 um

 and

 or or and we don't have people in some cases who's who are receiving payments

 who are born in the future.

 >> born in the future.

 >> born in the future.

 >> really?

 >> yes.

 there the people receiving payments whose birth date

 um was like

 in 2100

 and something >> okay so there's >> like next century >> is there a task

 >> we know we know that one of two things must be true

 um that that that either there's a mistake in the computer or it's fraud

 but if you have someone's birth date that's either in the future or

 where they are older than the oldest living american because the oldest living american is 114

 years old so if they're more than 114

 years

 um there is either a mistake

 and someone should should call them and say

 i i think we have your birthday

 wrong because it says you were born in 17 you know 8086

 um and

 um you know that was before you know

 um you know before there was really an america you know it was it was like

 you know kind of early you know we're still fighting england type of thing

 you it's like

 this person either needs to be in the guinness book of world records

 or or they're not alive,

 >> but still at the end of the day, money is going towards

 that

 account that's connected to this person that is either non-existent

 or >> so

 like like yeah.

 so there was like i think

 um something like i don't know 20 million

 people in the social security administration database that could not possibly be alive

 um if their birth date is

 like

 based on their birth date they could not possibly be alive.

 >> and then to be clear 20 million people that were receiving funds

 >> uh a bunch of

 most of them were not receiving funds.

 some of them were receiving funds.

 most were not receiving funds.

 but so let me tell you how the scam works.

 it's it's a bank shot.

 so

 the

 social security administration database is used as the source of truth by all the other databases

 that the government uses.

 so even if they stop the payments on the social security administration database

 like unemployment insurance,

 small business administration,

 student loans

 all check

 the social security administration database to say is this is this a legitimate alived person?

 and

 and if the

 social security database

 will say yes, this person is still alive

 even though they're 200

 years old.

 um but forgets to mention that they're 200 years old, it just says it just returns

 when when the computer is queries, it says yes, this person is alive.

 and so then they're able to exploit the entire rest of the government ecosystem.

 so fake then you get fake student loans, then you get fake unemployment

 insurance,

 then you get

 fake medical payments.

 and this doesn't have to be tied to an individual

 where where there's an address where you can check on this person.

 >> no,

 if you did do if just did any check at all, you would stop this.

 >> so, so, so that's that that that's so so

 >> and how much money do you think is >> any check like anything at all

 that would stop would stop the forward like any effort at all?

 >> um, yeah.

 >> so, there's multiple layers.

 the social security number verifies that this is a real person

 and then the other systems check

 every other government payment

 and every other government payment system for everything for like small small business administration

 student loans

 medicaid medicare

 every other government payment of which there are many there there actually

 hundreds of government payment

 systems

 can all be exploited so long as social security database says this person is alive

 that's the nature of the scam it's a bank shot.

 so then

 the then the rebuttal

 from the dems

 is like, oh

 well

 the

 vast

 majority

 of the people who are marked

 as alive in the social security

 administration

 weren't receiving social security administration

 payments.

 that is true.

 what they forgot to mention is they're getting fraudulent payments from every other government program.

 and that's why the the dms were so opposed

 to turning off to to declaring someone dead who was dead

 because it would stop the entire other

 all the other fraud from happening.

 and so, but all this is it trackable like all this other fraud.

 >> if they wanted to, they could chase it all down.

 >> yeah.

 it's not even hard.

 >> and yet they're opposing chasing it all down.

 >> they're opposing chasing it all down because it would it turns off the money magnet

 for the illegals.

 wow.

 because it's very logical to to like like i'm saying the most common sense things possible.

 if someone's got

 a birthday in social security that is an impossible birthday,

 meaning they are

 older than the oldest living american or were born in the future,

 then you should call them and say, "excuse me, we seem to have your birthday wrong."

 because it says that you're 200 years old.

 that's all you need to do.

 um,

 and

 >> and then you would remove them from the social security

 database

 and make that number no longer available

 for all those other government

 payments.

 >> exactly.

 >> wow.

 and how much money are we talking?

 >> it's hund hundreds of billions of dollars.

 >> and this is all traceable.

 like you could hunt all

 >> like you don't need to be sherlock holmes here is what i'm saying.

 >> well, this we don't need to call sherlock holmes for this one.

 is this part of >> you just need to call the person

 >> and and say, "excuse me, we either we we seem to have the

 like we we we

 must have your birthday wrong because it says you're 200 years old or were born

 in the future.

 um so could you tell us what your birthday is?

 that's all you need to do.

 it's it's that simple."

 but the all these other government payments

 that are available that are connected to this social security number,

 it seems like

 if you just chased that all down, yeah.

 >> you would find the widespread fraud.

 you would find where it's going.

 >> yes.

 the but the root of the problem is the social security administration database because

 um the social security number in the united states is used as a deacto

 national id number.

 you know that's why like the bank always asks for your social

 like the you know any financial institution will ask for your social security number.

 >> this is it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down.

 i mean

 >> i agree >> that i mean i mean that in and of itself is

 that's such mishandling.

 >> yes.

 no it's mind-blowing.

 um, so yeah, it's crazy.

 >> well, you were very reluctant

 last time you were here to talk about the extent

 of some of the fraud

 because you're like,

 they could kill me because this is kind of >> oh, what?

# Chapter 10

 >> you would find the widespread fraud.

 you would find where it's going.

 >> yes.

 the but the root of the problem is the social security administration database because

 um the social security number in the united states is used as a deacto

 national id number.

 you know that's why like the bank always asks for your social

 like the you know any financial institution will ask for your social security number.

 >> this is it sounds so insane that this isn't chased down.

 i mean

 >> i agree >> that i mean i mean that in and of itself is

 that's such mishandling.

 >> yes.

 no it's mind-blowing.

 um, so yeah, it's crazy.

 >> well, you were very reluctant

 last time you were here to talk about the extent

 of some of the fraud

 because you're like,

 they could kill me because this is kind of >> oh, what?

 yeah.

 what i was saying is that

 um the like if you create if like i like like to be pragmatic and realistic

 um you actually can't manage to zero fraud.

 you can manage to low fraud number but not to zero fraud.

 if you manage to zero fraud,

 um

 you you you're going to push so many people over the edge who are receiving fraudulent

 payments that the number of inbound

 homicidal maniacs will be

 really hard to overcome.

 so i i'm i'm

 actually taking

 i think quite a reasonable position which is that we should simply

 reduce the amount of fraud

 which i think is

 not an extremist position.

 um, and we should aspire to, you know, have less fraud over time.

 um, not that we should be ultra draconian and eliminate every last scrap of fraud.

 um,

 which

 i guess would be nice to have, but

 but

 like we don't even

 need to go that

 extreme.

 i'm i'm saying we should just stop the blatant large scale super obvious fraud.

 >> i think that's a reasonable position.

 >> it's a very reasonable position.

 yeah.

 and so

 what was the most shocking

 push back that you got when you started implementing

 doge?

 when you started investigating into where money was going?

 well,

 um i guess it this was i should have anticipated this, but

 um

 while most of the fraudulent government payments to especially to the nos's

 go to the democrats,

 most of it like i don't know for argument sake let's say 80%

 maybe 90%.

 um

 um 10 to 20% of it does go to republicans.

 and so when we'd turn off funding to a fraudulent ngo,

 we'd get complaints from

 whatever the 10% of republicans who were receiving the money

 and and they would, you know, they would very loudly complain.

 um

 because the the

 honest answer is the republicans are are partly they're receiving some of the fraud, too.

 they're getting a big >> jesus.

 yeah, it's i want to be clear.

 it's it's not like the republican party is some

 um ultra pure paragon of virtue here.

 >> no.

 >> okay.

 um >> well, you see that with the congressional insider training.

 it's across the board.

 >> yeah.

 >> it's left and right.

 >> i mean, the whole uni party criticism has some validity to it.

 you know, there's so

 um and it's it's

 like if you turn off fraudulent payments, it's not like

 like i say, it's not like 100% of those payments were going to democrats.

 a a small percentage were also going to republicans.

 those republicans complained very loudly.

 um and

 um

 you know and and that's that's

 so

 there was a lot of push back on the republican

 side for when we started cutting some of these these funds

 and i tried telling them like well you know

 90% of the money is going to your opponents

 but they still if they even if they're getting 10% of >> they want their peace.

 >> yeah.

 they want their peace >> and they've been getting that peace for a long time.

 >> yes.

 did you see >> this is why like you know politics is like >> it's dirty

 business.

 >> yeah.

 i mean that's like saying if like

 you know if if you if you like sausages

 and respect the law do not watch either of them being being made

 >> yeah.

 wow.

 well that's not even true because i've made sausage before.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 it's actually like it's not that big a deal.

 yeah.

 fat and spices and casing, >> run it through the machine.

 not that big a deal.

 >> yeah.

 um but yeah, i mean i i think the stuff i'm saying here is not

 like like

 if if you stand back and think about it for a second like

 oh yeah

 that that makes sense, you know.

 >> um the it's it's not like

 um it's not like one political party is going to be

 um you know pure devil or pure angel.

 there's,

 you know, i think there's there's there there's there's much more corruption on the democrat

 side, but it's not there's not

 there's still some corruption on the republican side.

 >> how did it happen that the majority of the corruption

 wound up being on the democrat side?

 >> well, because the the the transfer payments, especially to illegals,

 um, uh, are very much on the democrat side.

 >> that so that's the root of it all is the illegal situation.

 >> yes.

 i mean, there's >> or a focal point.

 >> yes.

 it's it's also like it's it's

 um it's it would also be accurate to say that while

 obviously

 not everyone who is a democrat is a criminal,

 almost everyone who is a criminal is a democrat

 because because the democrats are the soft crime party.

 so if you're a criminal, who you going to vote for?

 >> right.

 right.

 >> the soft crime party.

 did you think you were going to be able to get more done than you were?

 >> um, we did get a lot done, >> right?

 >> um, and doge is still still still happening, by the way.

 um, this the the doge is still underway.

 there are still there are still

 um there's still waste and fraud being being cut by by the doge team.

 so, it hasn't stopped.

 um, the >> it's less publicized.

 >> it's less publicized.

 um, and they don't have like a clear person to attack anymore.

 >> well, it seems like

 they basically they they applied immense pressure to me to just to stop it.

 so then i'm like the best thing for me is to just, you know,

 cut out of this.

 in any case, as a special government employee, i could only be there for like

 120 days anyway, something like that.

 so whatever the law says.

 so i i could i i i was necessarily

 could only be there for 4 months

 as a special government employee.

 so,

 um

 um but

 yeah, i mean i mean you turn off the money spigot to to fraudsters,

 they get very upset

 to say the least.

 um and

 um

 but my like my death threat level went

 ballistic, you know, was like a like a rocket going to orbit.

 um yeah.

 um,

 so

 but now that now now now that i'm not in dc that that that

 i guess they don't really have a person to attack

 anymore.

 >> um, >> well the rhetoric about you has calmed down significantly.

 >> yeah, >> it was disturbing.

 it was disturbing to watch.

 it was like this is crazy.

 >> and to watch these politicians

 engage in it and all these people just like framing you as this monster.

 i was like this is so weird.

 like this is what happens when you uncover fraud.

 >> yes.

 >> the whole machine turns on you.

 and if it wasn't for a person like you who owns a platform

 and has an enormous amount of money,

 like

 could have destroyed you.

 >> yeah.

 >> and that was the goal.

 >> the goal was to destroy me.

 absolutely.

 >> because you were getting in the way >> of this amazing graft.

 >> the the this gigantic fraud machine.

 >> yeah.

 >> um like i think i think doge team's on done a lot of good work.

 um, you know, and in in terms of

 fraud and waste prevented,

 my guess is it's,

 you know, probably

 on the order of two or 300 billion a year.

 so, it's pretty good.

 >> what do you think could have been done if you just had like full

 reign

 and

 total

 cooperation?

 how much do you think you could have saved?

 >> i mean, what level of of power are we assuming here?

 >> godlike.

 >> oh, yeah.

 i probably cut the federal budget in half and get more done.

 that is so crazy.

 it is so crazy that get more done and federal budget widespread.

 it's that widespread.

 >> well, i mean a whole bunch of government departments simply shouldn't exist in my opinion.

 um they they

 um you know

 um >> like examples

 >> well the department of ed department of education which was created

 recently

 like under

 jimmy carter

 um the our educational results have gone downhill ever since it was created.

 so if you if you create a department

 and the result of creating that department

 is a massive decline in educational

 results

 and it's department of education, you're better off not having it

 because we're literally

 we were did better before there was one

 than after >> when you let the states run it.

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 >> because at least the states can compete with one another.

 um so but the problem is like here like cutting department education.

 our kids need education.

 yeah, they do.

 but but this is a new department that didn't even exist

 um you know until late the late 70s.

 um and ever since that department was created, the results educational results have declined.

 and so why would you have an institution continue that has made education worse?

 it doesn't make sense.

 >> they killed it though, right?

 no, there still unfortunately >> but they were trying to kill it.

 >> it has been substantially reduced.

 >> okay.

 >> um >> what other organizations what other departments?

 >> well, i mean i'm a small government guy.

 so

 um

 you know when when the

 you know when the country was created we just we we just had the

 department of state, department of war

 um you know and and sort of the sort of the department of justice.

 we had an attorney general and treasury department.

 um i don't know why you need more than that.

 >> so what other departments specifically do you think are just completely ineffective?

 >> well, i mean here it's like a question.

 it's a sort of philosophical question of how much government do you think there should be?

 >> right.

 >> um in my opinion, there should be the least amount of government.

 i've heard the most bizarre argument against this

 is that you're cutting jobs and you're gonna leave people jobless.

 and i'm like, but their jobs are useless.

 >> yeah.

 paying people to do nothing doesn't make sense.

 um like there's a like a a great

 um a story about like milton friedman who is awesome.

 um

 what like generally whatever milton friedman said is you know people should should do that thing.

 i'm not sure if it's apocryphal or not, but

 um like like someone complained to him like

 he he he observed i think people that were like

 um digging ditches with you know with with

 um shovels and

 um and he said well

 like allegedly freeman said, "well, i think i think you should use you know

 um excavating equipment instead of shovels and you could get it done with far fewer people."

 and then and then someone said, "but then we're going to lose a lot of jobs."

 well, in that then freedom

 says, "well, in that case, why don't you have them use teaspoons?"

 just just dig ditches with teaspoons.

 think of all the jobs you'll create.

 >> i mean,

 it's [ __ ] basically,

 you just want people to work on on things that are that are productive.

 you want people to work on on building things

 um on building you know providing products and services that people find valuable

 um like you know making food

 um being you know being a farmer or

 a plumber or electrician

 or

 just anyone who's a builder or providing

 useful services.

 um and

 um that's what you want people to be doing.

 um not fake government jobs that that that don't add any value or may subtract value.

 um

 um

 there's also like you know

 to illustrate the absurdity of also how is the e how is the economy measured

 like the the way economists measure the economy is is is nonsensical

 because they'll

 measure

 any job

 no matter

 even if that job is a dumb job that has no point

 and is even counterproductive.

 so like, so the like the joke is like there's two economists

 going on a hike in the woods

 and they come across

 a pile of [ __ ]

 and one economist says to the other, "i'll pay you $100 to eat eat that shit."

 the economist eats the [ __ ] gets the $100. they they keep walking.

 then the other econ then come across another pile of [ __ ]

 and and the

 the other economist says, "now i'll pay you $100

 to eat the pile of shit."

 say pays the so pays the other economist

 $100 pile

 of [ __ ]

 then they then then then

 the way said they said like wait a second

 um we both just ate a pile of [ __ ]

 and we're no and and and and we're we're no we we we we

 don't have any more extra money like like

 we both you just gave the $100 back to me

 and we both ate a pile of [ __ ] this doesn't make any sense.

 and they said, "no, no, but think of the economy

 because that's $200

 of that in the economy

 that that

 basically

 measure eating eating [ __ ] would count

 as a as as a as a job.

 this is this is this is to illustrate the absurdity of of of economics.

 >> one of the things you said when

 things should not count as a job."

 one of the things you said when you stepped away is that you're kind of done

 and that

 it's unfixable.

 that

 um well or under its current form the way people are approaching it

 you can you can make it directionally better but ultimately you can't fully fix the system.

 um,

 so, uh,

 i i i

 like

 like like like

 it it it is it is it would be accurate to say that even

 like like unless you could go like super draconian

 like you know gangghaskhan

 level on on on

 cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country

 um an aspirationally democratic country then

 um there's no way to solve the the the debt crisis.

 so, we got we got national debt that's just insane

 where the debt payments the interest payments on the debt exceed

 our entire military budget.

 i mean, that's one that was one of the wakeup calls for me.

 i was like, "wait a second.

 the interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire the entire military budget

 um and growing.

 um this is crazy.

 um so

 um

 so so even if you implement all these savings,

 you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when america becomes goes bankrupt.

# Chapter 11

 like like like

 it it it is it is it would be accurate to say that even

 like like unless you could go like super draconian

 like you know gangghaskhan

 level on on on

 cutting waste waste and fraud which you can't really do in a democratic country

 um an aspirationally democratic country then

 um there's no way to solve the the the debt crisis.

 so, we got we got national debt that's just insane

 where the debt payments the interest payments on the debt exceed

 our entire military budget.

 i mean, that's one that was one of the wakeup calls for me.

 i was like, "wait a second.

 the interest on a national debt is bigger than the entire the entire military budget

 um and growing.

 um this is crazy.

 um so

 um

 so so even if you implement all these savings,

 you're only delaying the day of reckoning for when america becomes goes bankrupt.

 so unless you go full genghaskhan,

 um which you can't really do.

 so

 um

 so i came to the conclusion that

 the only way that the only way to get us out of

 the debt crisis and to prevent america from going bankrupt is ai and robotics.

 so, like we need to grow the economy

 um at

 at a at a at a rate

 that allows us to u to pay off our debt.

 um and

 um i i i guess people just generally don't appreciate the degree to which

 um you know this the the government overspending is is a problem.

 um but even like the social security website, this is under the biden administration.

 on the website, it would say like we based on on current demographic trends and

 um

 you and and and

 how much money social security is bringing in versus how many social security recipients

 there are because we have an aging population.

 relatively speaking, the average age is is increasing.

 social security will not be able to ma u maintain its full payments

 u i think in by 2032

 there.

 okay.

 so they will social security will have to stop will start reducing the

 the amount of money that that's been paid people

 um in in about seven years.

 >> and so the only way to fix that robotics manufacturing

 raise gdp >> you've got to basically massively increase the

 um

 economic output which is and the only way to do that is ai ai and robotics.

 so, so basically we're going bankrupt without ai and robotics with

 even with a bunch of savings

 um the savings the savings like reducing

 waste and forward can

 give us a longer runway but it cannot ultimately pay off our national debt.

 >> so what do you think the solution is to

 the jobs that are going to be lost because of ai and robotics?

 the jobs due to automation the jobs due to

 no longer do we need human beings to do these jobs because ai is doing them.

 do you think it's going to be some sort of a universal basic income thing?

 do you think there's

 going to be some other kind of solution

 that has to be implemented

 because a lot of people are going to be out of work, right?

 um i think there will be

 um actually a high demand for jobs but not necessarily the same jobs.

 so i mean this is actually this process has been happening

 um throughout

 um modern history.

 um i mean there used to be like like doing calculations

 um ma manually with with like a pencil and paper.

 it used to be a job.

 so they used to have like buildings

 full of people called computers

 where the the banks would like

 all you do all day is is is

 um you do calculations because they didn't have computers.

 they didn't they didn't have digital didn't have digital computers that that people >> yeah.

 well,

 it was just people would just like add and subtract

 stuff on piece of paper and and and

 that that would be how banks would do you know financial processing

 >> and you'd have to literally

 go over their equations

 to make sure the books are balanced.

 >> yeah.

 and most times it's just simple math like you know the

 like in a world before computers how did you calculate how did you you do transactions?

 you had to do them by hand.

 um so then when computers were introduced the job of doing

 um you know bank calculations no longer existed.

 um so people had to go do something else.

 um

 and that's what's going to happen that what's that's what is happening at an accelerated rate

 um due to ai and and then robotics.

 that's the issue though, right?

 the accelerated rate because it's going to be >> it's the accelerator.

 it's it's it's just happening.

 like i said, like ai is the supersonic tsunami.

 >> so that's what i call it, supersonic tsunami.

 um

 so >> it's like what other jobs

 will be available that aren't available now

 because of ai?

 >> um well ai

 um will is is really still digital.

 ultimately,

 um ai can improve the productivity of of humans who who

 um

 build things with their hands or do things with their hands like plum,

 you know, literally

 welding, electrical work, plumbing, anything that's that's physically moving atoms.

 um like cooking food or

 um you know farming or or like like anything that's that's physical

 those jobs will exist for a much longer time.

 but anything that is digital

 which is like just someone at a computer doing something,

 ai is going to take over those jobs like lightning,

 >> coding, anything along those lines.

 yeah, >> it's going to take over those jobs like lightning.

 um

 just like it just like

 digital computers took over the job of people doing manual calculations

 but but much faster.

 >> so what happens to all those people?

 like what kind of numbers are we talking about?

 you're going to lose most drivers, right?

 commercial drivers.

 you're going to have automated vehicles, ai controlled

 systems, just like there's certain ports in china, i think in singapore, where everything's completely automated.

 >> yeah.

 mostly.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 >> yeah.

 so, you're going to lose a lot of those jobs.

 long shoreman jobs, trucking, commercial drivers.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 i mean, we actually do have a shortage of of truck drivers, but there's there's actually

 um >> well, that's why california has hired so many illegals to do it.

 have you seen those numbers?

 >> yeah.

 um

 i mean, the problem is like when you when people

 don't know how to drive a semi-truck,

 which is actually a hard thing to do,

 then they they crash and kill people.

 >> yeah.

 >> um a friend of mine's wife was killed by an an illegal driving a truck

 and she was just out biking.

 um and

 there was an illegal he didn't know how to drive the truck or so or something.

 i mean and he he ran ran her over.

 um so i mean like thing is like for something

 like you you can't you can't let people drive

 you know

 sort of an 80,000lb semi

 um if if they don't know how to do it.

 but in california, they're just letting people do it

 >> because they need people to do it.

 >> well, they also need they want the votes and that kind of thing.

 but

 um but but yeah, like cars are

 um cars are going to be autonomous.

 um,

 but there there's just so many desk

 desk jobs where where really people what people are doing is they're processing

 email

 um or they're answering the phone.

 um,

 and and just anything that is

 that that isn't moving atoms like anything that is not physically like doing physical work

 that will obviously be the first thing

 those jobs will be and are being eliminated by by ai at a very rapid pace.

 um

 um and ultimately i working will be optional because you'll have robots plus ai

 um and we'll have in a benign scenario universal high income not just universal basic income

 universal high income meaning anyone can have any products or services that they want.

 so you >> but but there will be a lot of

 trauma and disruption along the way.

 >> so you anticipate a basic income

 from that that the economy will boost to such an extent that a high income

 would be available to almost everybody.

 so we'd essentially eliminate poverty >> um in the benign scenario.

 yes.

 so like the way >> there's multiple scenarios.

 >> there are multiple scenarios.

 there's a lot of ways this movie can end.

 um,

 like the reason i'm so concerned about ai safety is that like one of the possibilities

 is the terminator

 scenario.

 it's not it's not 0%.

 um, so

 um, that's why it's like i'm like really

 banging the drum on ai needs to be maximally truth seeeking.

 like don't

 make i don't force ai

 to believe a lie

 like that the for example the founding fathers were

 actually a group of diverse women or that misgendering

 is worse than nuclear

 war

 because you if if that's the case and then you get the robots

 and the ai

 becomes

 omnipotent

 it can enforce that outcome

 and then

 then like

 unless you're a diverse woman you're you're out of the picture so we're we're toast

 so that's >> um or you might wake up as a diverse woman one day

 has adjusted the picture and and we are now >> everyone's a diverse woman.

 so that would be that's the the worst possible situation.

 so

 what would be the steps that we would have to

 take in order to implement the benign

 solution

 where it's universal high income like best case scenario this is the path forward to

 universal high income for essentially every single citizen

 that the

 the economy

 gets boosted by ai and robotics

 to such an extent

 that no one ever has to work again

 and what about meaning for those people which is which gets really weird.

 >> yeah.

 >> i don't know how to answer the question about meaning.

 um >> that's an individual problem, right?

 but it's going to be an individual problem for millions of people.

 >> yeah.

 well, i i mean i i i guess i've like for fought against

 saying like,

 you know, i

 you know, i've been i've

 been a voice saying like, "hey,

 we need to slow down

 ai.

 we need to slow down all these things.

 um, and and we need to, you know, not not have a crazy ai race.

 i've been saying that for a long time, for 20 20 plus years.

 um,

 but but then i, you know, i came to realize that,

 um, really there's two choices here.

 either be a spectator or a or a participant.

 and if i'm a, if i'm a spectator, i can't really influence the direction of ai.

 but if i'm a participant, i can try to influence the direction of ai and

 have a maximally truth seeeking

 ai with with

 good values

 that

 loves humanity.

 and that's what we're trying to create with grock at xai.

 and

 um you know, the research is i think bearing this out.

 like i said, the when they when they compared like

 how do ais value the weight of a human life?

 um

 grock was the only one the only one of the ais that weighted human life equally.

 um and and didn't and didn't say like a white guy's

 worth 120th of a of a of a a black woman's life.

 literally, that's what they they calculation they came up with.

 >> so, i'm like, this is i'm like, this is very alarming.

 we should we got to watch this stuff.

 >> so, this is one of the things that has to happen

 in

 order to reach this benign

 solution.

 >> yeah.

 we we we i i just keep >> best movie ending.

 yeah.

 um, you you want a a curious truth seeeking ai.

 um, and i think a curious truth seeeking ai will want to foster humanity.

 uh, because we're much more interesting than

 um a bunch of rocks.

 like you say, like like i i love mars, you know, but

 but mars is kind of boring.

 like it's just a bunch of red rocks.

 um, it does some cool stuff.

 it's got a tall mountain.

 it's got, you know, it's got the biggest re the biggest ravine and the tallest mountain.

 um, but there's no there's no there's no animals or plants or

 and and there's no people.

 um,

 and uh, you know, so

 humanity is just much more interesting

 if you're a curious truth seeeking ai than

 not humanity.

 it's just much more interesting.

 um,

 i mean like as as humans, we could go for example and and eliminate all chimps.

 if we said if we put our minds to it, we could say

 we could go out and we could

 annihilate

 all chimps

 and all gorillas, but but we don't.

 um there has been encroachment on their environment, but we we actually try to preserve

 the the chimp and gorilla habitats.

 um and

 um and i think in a good scenario, ai would do the same with with humans.

 it would actually foster human civilization and care about human happiness.

 so this is

 um this is the thing to to try to achieve i think.

 um,

 >> but what is the what does the landscape look like if you have grock

 competing with open ai, competing with all these different like

 how does it work?

 like

 what

 what if you have ais that have been captured by ideologies

 that are side by side competing with grock?

 like

 how do we

 so this is one of the reasons why you felt like it's important to

 not just be

 a

 an observer but participate

 and then have grock be more successful and more potent

 than these other applications.

 yes, as long as there's at least one ai that is maximally truth seeeking, curious, and

 um you know, and for example, weighs all you know, human lives equally

 um does not favor one race or gender, then

 um

 then then that that that

 and and people are able to look at look at,

 you know, grock at xai

 and compare that and say, "wait a second,

 why are all these other ais

 being basically

 sexist and racist?"

 um

 um and

 then then that that causes some embarrassment for

 the the

 other ais

 and then they they they they

 fix they you know they they improve

 they tend to improve just in the in the same way that

 um acquiring twitter and allowing the truth to be told and and not suppressing the truth

 um forced the other social media companies to be more truthful

 um by in in the same way having

 um gro be a maximally truth seeeking, curious ai is will force the other ai companies

 to

 um be also be more truth seeeking and fair.

 >> and the funniest thing is even though like the socialists and the marxists are

 in opposition to a lot of your ideas,

 but if this gets implemented and you really can achieve

 universal high income,

 that's the greatest

 socialist solution of all time.

 like literally no one will have to work.

 correct.

 um

 like i said so so

 there is a benign

 scenario

 here which

# Chapter 12

 they tend to improve just in the in the same way that

 um acquiring twitter and allowing the truth to be told and and not suppressing the truth

 um forced the other social media companies to be more truthful

 um by in in the same way having

 um gro be a maximally truth seeeking, curious ai is will force the other ai companies

 to

 um be also be more truth seeeking and fair.

 >> and the funniest thing is even though like the socialists and the marxists are

 in opposition to a lot of your ideas,

 but if this gets implemented and you really can achieve

 universal high income,

 that's the greatest

 socialist solution of all time.

 like literally no one will have to work.

 correct.

 um

 like i said so so

 there is a benign

 scenario

 here which

 i think probably

 people will be happy with

 if if as long as we we achieve it which is

 sustainable

 abundance.

 um which is if if

 um

 if everyone can have every like like like

 if if you ask people like what's the future that you want

 >> um and

 i think

 a

 future where

 we

 haven't destroyed

 nature

 like you can still

 we have the national parks

 we have the the amazon

 rainforest

 still still there we haven't paved we haven't paved the paved the rainforest

 like the natural beauty is still there but but people have

 nonetheless everyone has abundance everyone has excellent medical care.

 everyone has whatever goods and services they want.

 >> and we just >> it kind of sounds like heaven.

 >> it sounds like it is like the ideal socialist utopia.

 and

 this idea that the only thing you should be doing with your time

 is working in order to pay your bills and feed yourself

 sounds kind of archaic

 considering the kind of technology that's at play.

 >> yeah.

 >> like a world where that's not your concern at all anymore.

 everybody has money for food.

 everybody has abundance.

 everybody has electronics in their home.

 everybody essentially has a high income.

 now you can kind of do whatever you want.

 and your day can now be exploring your interests doing things that you actually enjoy doing.

 your purpose just has to shift.

 instead of,

 you know, i'm a hard worker

 and

 this is what i do and that's how i

 that's how i define

 myself.

 no.

 now you can [ __ ] golf all day, you know?

 you can whatever it is that you enjoy doing can now be your main pursuit.

 >> yeah.

 >> well, that sounds crazy good.

 >> yeah, that's that's that's the benign scenario that we should be.

 >> the best ending to the movie is actually pretty good.

 >> yes.

 um like i think there's there is still this question of meaning

 um of like making sure people don't lose meaning you know like

 um so hopefully they can find meaning in ways that are

 not that that's not derived from their work

 >> and purpose

 purpose for things that you you know find things that you do that you enjoy

 but there's a lot of people that are independently

 wealthy that spend most of their time doing something they enjoy

 >> right

 >> and that could be the majority of people

 >> pretty much everyone.

 >> but we'd have to rewire how people approach life.

 >> mhm.

 >> which seems to be like acceptable because you're not asking them to be enslaved.

 you're exactly asking them the opposite.

 like no longer be burdened by financial worries.

 now go do what you like.

 >> yes.

 >> go [ __ ] test pizza.

 >> do whatever you want.

 >> um pretty much.

 um, so that's that's that's the that's the that's probably the best case outcome.

 >> that sounds like the best case outcome period for the future.

 if you're looking at like how much people have struggled just to feed themselves

 all throughout history,

 food, shelter, safety,

 if all of that stuff

 can be fixed, like how much would you solve a lot of the crime

 if there was a universal high income?

 just think of that.

 like how much of crime is financially motivated?

 you know, the greater percentage of people that are committing crimes live in poor, disenfranchised neighborhoods.

 >> so if there's no such thing anymore,

 if you really can achieve universal

 high income,

 >> yeah, >> that this is it sounds like a utopian.

 >> yes.

 um i think some people may commit crime because they like committing crime.

 it just some some amount of that is they just >> wild people out there.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 um >> and obviously they've become 40 years old living a life like that.

 now all of a sudden universal high income is not going to completely stop their instincts.

 >> yeah.

 um

 i mean i guess if you want to have like like

 say read a science fiction

 book

 or

 some books that that

 are probably

 an accurate or or the the least inaccurate version of the future.

 i'd say i' i'd recommend

 um the ian banks books called the the culture books.

 it's not actually a series.

 it's a it's like ai sci-fi books about the future.

 they're generally called the culture books.

 yen banks culture books.

 it's worth reading those.

 >> when did he write these?

 >> he started writing them in the 70s.

 um and i think he

 um

 the last one i think he was

 i think it was written just like around i don't know maybe 2010 or something.

 i'm not sure exactly.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 >> scottish author ian banks from 87 to 2012. >> yeah.

 interesting.

 >> but he but like he wrote the the like his first book, consider flever.

 like he started writing that in the 70s.

 >> these books are incredible, by the way.

 >> oh, >> incredible books.

 >> 4.6 stars on amazon.

 >> interesting.

 >> so, um, >> so this gives me hope.

 >> uh, yeah.

 yeah.

 >> this is the first time i've ever thought about it this way.

 >> yeah.

 well, i mean,

 if like

 i often ask people, "what is the future that you want?"

 and they have to think about it for a second cuz, you know, they're usually

 tied up in whatever the daily struggles are.

 but, but you say, "what is the future that you want?" um,

 and um, and generally sustainable abundance,

 what do these folks say, "what about a future where there's sustainable

 abundance?" like, "oh, yeah, that's a pretty good future."

 um so

 um

 you know if if and and and that that future is attainable with ai and robotics

 um

 but but

 you know it's it's like i said there's not every path is a good path.

 there's this it's but i think if we if we push it in the direction of

 um

 maximally truth seeeking and curious

 then i think ai will want to take to to take care of humanity and foster

 foster humanity

 um because we're interesting

 um

 and if it hasn't been programmed to think that like all straight white male should die,

 which gemini was basically programmed to do at least at first.

 um, you know, they seem to have fixed it.

 i hope they fixed it.

 >> but don't you think culturally

 like, oh, we're getting away from that mindset and that people realize

 how preposterous that all is.

 >> we are getting away from it.

 um,

 so, uh, we are getting at least it knows the ai mostly knows to hide things.

 but like

 like i said, there is that

 i i think i

 still have that as or

 i had that as my like

 pinned

 post on x

 which was like hey wait a second guys we still have

 every ai except grock is saying that

 basically straight white male should die

 um and this is a problem and we should fix it.

 um and you know but simply me saying that is like tends to generally result in

 um you know them like that is kind of bad.

 maybe we should just we should not have all straight white males die.

 um i think they say also all all straight asian males should also die as well.

 like that like

 like generally

 the generally the ai and the and the media

 which which back back in the day the

 the media was

 um you know racist against black people and sexist against women back in the day.

 now now it is racist against white people and asians and sexist against men.

 >> um so they just like being racist and sexist.

 i think they just want to change the target.

 um so but but really they just shouldn't be racist and sexist at all.

 um you know >> ideally that would be nice.

 >> that would be nice.

 um,

 and it's kind of crazy that we were kind of moving

 in that general

 direction

 till around

 2012

 >> and then everything

 ramped up online and and everybody was accused of being a nazi and everybody was transphobic

 and racist and sexist and homophobic and everything got exaggerated

 to the point where it was this wild witch hunt

 where everyone was a colomo

 looking for racism.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 totally.

 um, well well but but but they they were openly anti-white and often openly anti-asian.

 and then this new sentiment that you cannot be racist against white people

 cuz racism is

 power

 and influence.

 >> okay.

 no, it's not.

 >> yeah.

 racism is is is racism in the absolute.

 um so

 um you know and there just needs to be consistency.

 so if it's okay to have let's say

 black or asian or indian or pride, it should be okay to have white pride, too.

 >> yeah.

 um, so that's just a that's just a consistency question.

 um,

 so,

 uh, you know, um,

 if it if it's okay to be proud of one religion,

 it should be okay to be proud of, i i guess all religions provided

 they're

 that they're they're not like

 oppressive.

 >> yeah.

 or or or don't like as long as part of that religion is not like exterminating

 people who are not in that religion type, >> right?

 um so it's really just like a consistency bias.

 um or or just like ensuring consistency to eliminate bias.

 um so if it is possible to be racist against

 one race, it is possible to be racist against any race.

 um so >> of course logically.

 >> yes.

 >> yeah.

 and arguing against that is that's when you know you're catching

 >> it's a it's a logical inconsistency

 that makes ais go insane

 >> and people >> and people go insane.

 yes.

 >> um >> but like the the like like you can't simultaneously say

 um that there's the systemic racist oppression but also that races don't exist

 that that race race is a social construct.

 like which is it?

 you know,

 um you also can't say that

 um

 you know, anyone who steps foot in america is is automatically an american

 except for the people that originally came here.

 >> exactly.

 exactly.

 except for the colonizers.

 >> yeah.

 except for the evil colonizers who came here, >> right?

 >> so which one is it?

 like

 if you

 if as soon as you step foot put in a place you are that

 you are

 just as american as everyone else

 >> then

 um that would have appi if you apply that consistently then the original

 white settlers were also just as american as everyone else.

 >> yeah.

 logically.

 >> logically.

 um,

 one more thing that i have to talk to you about before you leave is

 the rescuing of the people from the space station,

 which, uh, we talked about,

 you were planning it the last time you were here.

 >> um,

 the f the

 lack of coverage

 that that got in mainstream media

 was one of the most shocking things that >> yeah, they totally memoryhold

 that thing.

 >> wild.

 yes.

 because if it wasn't, >> it's like it didn't exist.

 those people would be dead.

 they'd be stuck up there.

 >> well, they'd they'd probably still be alive, but they'd they'd be having bone density issues

 because of prolonged exposure to zero gravity.

 >> well, they were already up there for like 8 months, right?

 >> yeah.

 >> which is an insanely long time.

 it takes forever to recover just from that.

 >> yeah.

 they're only supposed to be at the space station for 3 to 6 months maximum.

 so,

 >> one of the things you told me that was so crazy

 was that you could have gotten them sooner,

 but >> yeah.

 but for political reasons, they didn't they did not want

 spacex or me to be associated with

 um returning the astronauts before the election.

 >> that is so wild that that's a fact.

 >> first of all, that >> we absolutely could have done it.

 um so,

 >> but even though you did do it and you did it after the election,

 it received almost no media coverage anyway.

 >> yes.

 because

 nothing good can the the the media which is essentially

 a far left prop the legacy mainstream media is a far-lft propaganda machine.

 um and so anything

 any story that is positive about someone who is not

 part of the sort of far-left tribe will not

 get any coverage.

 >> i i could save a busload of orphans and and

 it it wouldn't get a single news story.

 >> yeah, it's it really is nuts.

 it it was nuts to watch because

 even though it was discussed

 on podcasts

 and it was discussed on x and it was discussed on social media,

 it's still it was a blip in the news cycle.

 it was very quick.

 it was in and out and because it was a su successful launch

 and

 you did rescue

 those people,

 nobody

 got hurt and

 there was nothing really to

 there was no blood

 to

 talk about,

 >> right?

 >> just [ __ ] in and out.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 absolutely.

 well, and and as as you saw firsthand with the starship launch, like starship is

 um you know by

 you know at least by some some would consider it to be like the most amazing

 you know engineering project that's happening on earth right now

 outside of like you know maybe ai

 or ai and robotics but but certainly in terms of a spectacle

 to see it is

 the most spectacular thing that is happening on earth right now

 is the starship launch program

 which anyone can go and see if they just go to south texas

 and just they can just rent a hotel room low cost in

 south padre island or in brownsville

 and you can see the launch

 and you can drive right right past the factory because it's on a public highway.

 um but it gets no coverage

 or what coverage it does get was like a rocket blew up coverage, >> right?

 yeah.

 oh, he's a [ __ ] the rocket blew up.

 like the the the the star sasha program is vastly

 >> vastly more capable than the entire apollo moon moon program.

 vastly more capable.

 this is a spaceship that is designed to make life multilanetary to carry

 millions of people across the heavens to another planet.

 the the apollo program

 could could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time.

 like they could send two the entire apollo program could only send astronauts

 to visit the moon very briefly

 and then for a few hours and then depart.

# Chapter 13

 is the starship launch program

 which anyone can go and see if they just go to south texas

 and just they can just rent a hotel room low cost in

 south padre island or in brownsville

 and you can see the launch

 and you can drive right right past the factory because it's on a public highway.

 um but it gets no coverage

 or what coverage it does get was like a rocket blew up coverage, >> right?

 yeah.

 oh, he's a [ __ ] the rocket blew up.

 like the the the the star sasha program is vastly

 >> vastly more capable than the entire apollo moon moon program.

 vastly more capable.

 this is a spaceship that is designed to make life multilanetary to carry

 millions of people across the heavens to another planet.

 the the apollo program

 could could only send astronauts to the moon for a few hours at a time.

 like they could send two the entire apollo program could only send astronauts

 to visit the moon very briefly

 and then for a few hours and then depart.

 the starship program could create an entire lunar base with a million people.

 you understand the mag the magnitudes are >> there's different very different magnitudes here.

 >> so what was the political >> basically no no coverage of it.

 >> yeah.

 but what i wanted to ask you is like what so what were the conversations

 leading up to the rescue like when you were like i can get them out

 way quicker.

 >> yeah.

 um

 um well i mean

 you know i raised this a few times but it was

 the i was told instructions came from the white house that

 you know that that there should be no attempt to rescue before the election.

 >> that should be illegal.

 >> that that that

 really should be

 a horrendous

 miscarriage of justice for those poor people that were stuck on that.

 >> um yeah it it is it is crazy.

 um, >> have you ever talked to those folks afterwards?

 did you have conversations with them?

 >> yeah.

 i mean, they they're they're

 not going to say anything

 political

 to,

 you know, they're not

 like they're never going to

 >> say thank you.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 >> well, that's nice.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 absolutely.

 so, um, >> but the instructions came down from the white house.

 he cannot rescue them because politically this is a a bad hand of cards.

 >> i mean, they didn't say because politically it's a bad hand of cards.

 they they just said

 they were they were not interested in any rescue operation before the election.

 >> yeah.

 so >> what did that feel like?

 >> i wasn't surprised.

 >> but it's crazy.

 >> yeah,

 >> because biden could have authorized it

 and they could have said the the biden administration

 is helping bring those people back, throw you a little funding,

 give you some money to do it.

 the biden administration, they funded these people being returned.

 >> uh yeah, the biden administration was not exactly my best friend,

 >> especially especially after i

 um you know,

 you know, helped trump get elected get get elected, which i mean some people

 >> still think, you know, trump is like the the devil basically.

 um, and i mean i think i think trump actually

 he's not he's is not perfect, but but

 he's not evil.

 trump is not evil.

 i spent a lot of time with with him and he's

 >> i mean he's a product of his time.

 but he is not he's not evil.

 >> um >> no, i don't think he's evil either.

 but if you look at the media coverage,

 >> the media the media treason like he's super evil.

 it's pretty shocking if you look at the amount of negative coverage.

 like one of the things that i looked at the other day was mainstream

 media coverage

 of

 you,

 trump,

 a bunch of different public figures and then >> 96% negative or something crazy

 >> and then mum donnie,

 which is like 95% positive,

 >> right?

 um i mean manny is is is is a charismatic swindler.

 um

 i i

 i mean you got to hand it to him like

 he

 he

 does he can light up a stage.

 um but he has just been a swindler his entire life.

 um and

 um you know and and i think he what he's i mean he's likely to win.

 he's likely to be mayor of new york new york city.

 >> very likely.

 >> yeah.

 very likely.

 i think poly market has it at what what is the >> 94%?

 >> yeah, that sounds pretty likely.

 >> that's crazy.

 >> like i'm not sure who the 6% are, you know.

 >> um so, so yeah.

 so that's

 um >> what's also like who's on the other side?

 the [ __ ] guardian angel guy with the beret

 and andrew cuomo who doesn't even have a party.

 like they the democrats don't even want him.

 so you have those two options.

 um, >> and then you have the young kids who are like finally socialism.

 >> yeah, they they don't know what they're talking about obviously.

 um,

 so

 you know, like you just look at this say how many boats

 come from cuba to florida

 and how many but and how many boats because you know there's like a constant

 i always think like how many boats are accumulating

 on the shores of florida coming from from cuba,

 >> right?

 um

 there's a there's a whole bunch of free boats that

 you could

 if you want to

 go

 take them back to cuba.

 it's pretty close.

 >> yeah.

 >> but for some reason people don't do that.

 >> why why why why are the boats only coming in this direction?

 >> um >> well who is who are the most rabid capitalists in america?

 the [ __ ] cubans.

 >> absolutely.

 >> yeah.

 they're like we've seen how this story goes.

 >> we do not want exactly.

 >> [ __ ] off.

 cubans in miami, they don't want to hear any [ __ ]

 they don't want to hear any socialism [ __ ] they're like, "no, no, no.

 we know what this actually is.

 this isn't just some [ __ ] dream." >> yeah.

 it's extreme government oppression.

 um >> that's how it's a nightmare.

 and like the like an obvious way you can tell which

 which ideology is is the bad one is

 um who has to which ideology

 is building a wall to keep people in

 and prevent them from escaping.

 >> right?

 >> like so east berlin built the built the wall not west berlin, >> right?

 >> they built the wall because people were trying to escape from communism to west berlin.

 but there wasn't anyone going from west berlin to east berlin, >> right?

 >> that's why the communists had to build a wall to keep people from escaping.

 >> they're going to have to build a wall around new york city.

 >> yeah.

 that so, so that an ideology is problematic.

 if that ideology has to build a wall to keep people in with machine guns,

 >> yes.

 >> and shoot you if you try to leave.

 also, there's no examples of it being successful ever.

 we're only working out for people.

 no, there's examples of a bunch of lies like north korea.

 give this land to the state.

 we'll be in control of food.

 no one goes hungry.

 no.

 now, no one can grow food but the government

 and we'll tell you exactly what you eat and you eat very little.

 >> right.

 >> yeah.

 what?

 when you say mom donny's

 a swindler,

 i know he has a bunch of fake accents that he used to use.

 yeah.

 >> and you know, but what else has he done that makes him a swindler?

 um

 well i i guess if you say

 what i mean

 if if say if you say to any audience whatever that audience wants to hear

 instead of what

 instead of

 having a consistent

 message

 i would say that that is a swindly

 thing to do.

 um and yeah

 um

 yeah but but he is he is charismatic.

 um >> yeah good-looking guy.

 smart, charismatic.

 >> yeah.

 >> great on a microphone.

 >> yeah.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 yeah.

 and and what the young people want to see, >> you know, like this

 ethnic guy who's young and vibrant and has all these socialist ideas align with them and

 you know, they're

 bunch of broke dorks

 just out of college

 like, "yay,

 let's vote for this." and there's a lot of them

 and they're they're activated.

 they're motivated.

 >> um, >> i guess we'll we'll we'll see what happens here.

 >> what do you think happens if he wins?

 um because like 1% of new york city is responsible for 50% of their tax base,

 which is kind of nuts.

 50% of the tax revenue comes from 1% of the population.

 and those are the people that you're scaring off.

 you know, you lose one half of 1%.

 yeah, i mean hopefully this the stuff he's he said, you know, about

 government takeovers of of like that all the stores should be the government basically.

 um >> i don't think he said that.

 i think he said government they want to do government supermarkets, some state-run or cityrun supermarkets.

 >> yeah.

 um well, it just the the government is the dmv at scale.

 so

 um you have to say like do you want the dmv running your supermarket?

 >> right.

 um, was your last experience at the dmv amazing?

 uh, and if it wasn't, you probably don't want the government doing things.

 >> imagine if they were responsible for getting you blueberries.

 >> yeah.

 it's not going to be good.

 i mean, the

 the the thing about,

 you know, communism

 is is it was it was all bread lines and bad shoes.

 um, you know, do do you want ugly shoes and bread lines?

 because that's what communism gets you.

 it's going to be interesting to see what happens and whether or not

 they snap out of it and overcorrect

 and go to some rudy giuliani type character next

 cuz it's been a long time since there was any sort of republican leader there.

 and we we live in the in the most interesting of times

 um because we we face the you know simultaneously face civilizational decline

 um and incredible pro prosperity

 um and these these timelines are interwoven

 um so

 um if mani's policies are put into place especially at scale

 um it it would be a catastrophic

 decline in living standards not just for the rich but for everyone.

 um as as has been the case with with every

 um every for every every socialist experiment

 um or every yeah.

 so

 um but but then as you pointed out the the irony is that like

 um the ultimate capitalist thing of ai and robotics enabling

 prosperity for all and an abundance of goods and services actually the capitalist

 implementation of ai and robotics assuming it goes down the the good path

 is is actually what results in the communist utopia.

 because fate is fate is an irony maximizer, >> right?

 and and an actual socialism of maximum abundance of highincome people.

 >> universal high income.

 >> yeah.

 >> like the the problem with communism is is universal low income.

 um it's it's not that everyone gets elevated, it's that everyone gets oppressed except for

 a very small minority of of politicians

 who live a lives of luxury.

 that's what's happening every time it's been done.

 >> yeah.

 um so

 um but then the

 the actual communist utopia if everyone gets anything they want will be will be

 if if will be achieved

 if it is achieved it will be achieved via c capitalism

 >> because fate is an irony maximizer.

 >> i feel like we should probably end it on that.

 is there anything else?

 the most ironic outcome is the most likely, especially if entertaining.

 >> well, everything has been entertaining.

 as long as the bad things aren't happening to you, it's quite fascinating.

 and it's never a boring moment.

 >> yes.

 so there's i do have a theory of why

 um like if if if simulation theory is true then

 um it is actually very likely that

 um the most interesting outcome is the is the most likely

 because only the simulations that are interesting will continue.

 the simulators will stop any simulations that are boring because they're they're not interesting.

 >> but here's the question about the simulation theory.

 is the simulation run by anyone or is >> it would be run by someone?

 >> it would be run by >> some some >> some force

 >> the pro the program like

 in in this reality that we live in, we we run simulations

 all the time.

 like so when we try to figure out if the rocket's gonna make it, we run

 um thousands sometimes millions of simulations just to figure out which which

 path is the good path for the rocket

 and and where can it go wrong, where can it fail.

 um

 but we when we do these

 i say at this point millions of simulations of of what can happen with the rocket

 um we ignore the ones that are where everything goes right

 um because we we we

 just care about the

 we have we have to address the situations

 where it goes wrong.

 um so

 um

 so so basically in in in and and for for ai simulations

 as well like like all these things we

 we keep the simulations going that are the most interesting to us.

 um so if simulation theory is accurate if if it is true who knows

 um then the

 the

 the simulators

 will will only

 they will continue to run the simulations

 that are most interesting there.

 therefore from a darwinian perspective

 um the only surviving simulations will be the interest the most interesting ones.

 and in order to

 um avoid getting turned off

 the only

 rule is you must keep it interesting

 or you will if or you will

 because the boring simulations will be terminated.

 >> are you still completely convinced that this is a simulation?

 >> i didn't say i was completely convinced.

 >> well, you said it's like the odds of it not being are in the billions.

 but i guess it's not completely cuz you're saying there's a chance.

 >> what are the odds that we're in base reality?

 um well given that given that that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations.

 so if you think of say

 video games and how video games have gone from very simple

 video games like pong

 with

 you know two rectangles

 and a square

 to video games today being

 um photorealistic

 with millions of people playing simultaneously and all of that has occurred in our lifetime.

 so if that trend continues, uh, video games will be indistinguishable from reality.

 the fidelity of the game will be such that you you don't know if that

# Chapter 14

 rule is you must keep it interesting

 or you will if or you will

 because the boring simulations will be terminated.

 >> are you still completely convinced that this is a simulation?

 >> i didn't say i was completely convinced.

 >> well, you said it's like the odds of it not being are in the billions.

 but i guess it's not completely cuz you're saying there's a chance.

 >> what are the odds that we're in base reality?

 um well given that given that that we're able to create increasingly sophisticated simulations.

 so if you think of say

 video games and how video games have gone from very simple

 video games like pong

 with

 you know two rectangles

 and a square

 to video games today being

 um photorealistic

 with millions of people playing simultaneously and all of that has occurred in our lifetime.

 so if that trend continues, uh, video games will be indistinguishable from reality.

 the fidelity of the game will be such that you you don't know if that

 what you're seeing is a real video or a fake video.

 um, and like ai generated videos at this point, you

 like

 you can sometimes tell it's an ai generated video, but often you cannot tell and

 soon you will not really just not be able to tell.

 so

 um if if that's happening in our direct observation

 then and and we're create we'll create millions if not billions of photorealistic simulations of reality

 then what are the odds that we're in base reality or versus someone else's simulation?

 well, isn't it just possible that the simulation is inevitable,

 but that we are in base reality building towards a simulation?

 we're making simulations.

 um, so

 um we're making simulations.

 we make like you can just think of like photorealistic video games as as being simulations.

 >> mh.

 um,

 and

 especially as you apply

 ai in these video games, the the characters in the video games will be incredibly

 interesting to talk to.

 they won't just have a limited dialogue tree

 where if you go to like the the crossbow

 merchant

 or like and you you try to talk about any subject except buying a crossbow,

 they just want to talk about selling you a crossbow.

 um, but with with with ai based non-player characters,

 you can you'll be able to have an elaborate conversation with no dialogue tree.

 well, that might be the solution for meaning for people.

 just lock in and you could be a [ __ ] vampire and whatever.

 you live in avatar land.

 you could do it.

 you could do whatever you want.

 i mean, you don't have to think about money or food.

 >> ready player one.

 >> yeah.

 literally.

 yeah.

 but with higher living standards.

 >> yeah.

 >> you don't have to be in a little trailer.

 i >> i mean, i think this people do want to have some amount of

 struggle or something they want to push against.

 um

 but but it it could be you know playing a

 a sports or playing a game or something.

 >> it could be easily playing a game

 and especially

 playing a game where

 you're now no longer worried about like physical attributes

 like athletics

 like bad joints and hips and stuff like that.

 now

 it's completely digital

 but yet you do have meaning in pursuing this thing that you're doing all day.

 whatever the [ __ ] that means.

 it's going to be weird.

 >> it's going to be interesting.

 >> it's gonna be very interesting.

 >> um the most the most interesting

 >> and and usually ironic outcome is the most likely.

 >> all right.

 >> that's a good predictor of the future.

 >> thank you.

 thanks for being here.

 really appreciate you.

 appreciate your time.

 you i know you're a busy man, so

 this means a lot you come here to do this.

 welcome.

 all right.

 thank you.

 bye, everybody.
