# Chapter 1

i'm here with mr beast

the brilliant mastermind behind some of the most popular videos ever created

do you think you'll ever make a video that gets 1 billion views

i think maybe one of the videos we've already made might get a billion views

which one

do you think

probably like the the squid game video with enough time

i mean it's only a year old and it's already on 300 million

or some of the newer ones we've done have gotten like 100 million views in a month

um

so those four projected over 10 years

because youtube's not going anywhere

probably one of those

so over time they don't necessarily plateau

what's interesting

we're literally jumping right now

i love it

it's good

um

so i i'm a firm believer

that it's much easier to hypothetically get 10 million views on one video

than a hundred thousand on a hundred

and part of why it's much easier in my opinion

is like if you make a really good video

it's just so evergreen

and it never dies

because youtube

when you open up youtube and look at the videos

they're just serving you

whatever they think

you'll like the best you know

and so

if you just make a great video and it's constantly just above every other video

you know

even two years down the road

then they'll just keep serving it

never stop

you know

which is why it's much easier to make one great video than a bunch of mediocre

ones

what about 1 billion subscribers

you've uh

passed

pewdiepie's the most subscribed to youtube channel

uh

when do you think you get a billion

uh

let me do some math real quick

so we're on 120

what do you think about this

no

i don't

honestly

i

because one thing you'll find if you want to gain subscribers

if you want to get views

if you want to make money and almost any metric in this

uh

video creation space

if you want something

it all comes back to

okay

well

then just make great videos

so

instead of like focusing on all these arbitrary vanity metrics

i just kind of focus on the one thing that gets me all that

which is make good videos

but and that

i do think we will when they hit a billion subscribers

i don't have a plan on going anywhere

even though we're only on 120 million right now

on the main channel

i think like we're doing around 10 million a month now

and um youtube

just yeah

i just don't see it going anywhere

and i don't see any reason why i'd ever get burnt out or quit

so i think

with enough time

yes

i wanted to ask you those family friendly questions before i go to the doc question

so now we have dark questions right now

but if you wanted to hook them

you would start off with the dark questions

that's how you get them

okay

well

let me ask you about the uh

a twitter poll

you posted a ten thousand dollar death poll

he tweeted if someone offered you ten thousand dollars

but if you take it

a random person on earth dies

would you take the ten thousand dollars and

uh

forty five percent of people said

yes

that's at least at the time

i checked 850 000 people committing murder for just 8. 5 billion dollars in total

so

uh

what do you learn about human nature from that

that's a a good question

um

honestly

this is like late at night when i threw that up too

i was just like

huh

this will be a funny thing

i assumed it'd be 90 known like 10

yes

but there are a lot of serious people

um

for you guys listening

i just did this random twitter poll i was like

would you take 10 grand if it meant someone random in the world died

and a lot of the replies on this week were like hell

yeah

why not

and i was just not expecting that

um

and so i don't really know

i mean i feel like your take would be better than mine

was it disturbing to you

surprising to you a little bit

yeah

but i

you know

obviously a lot of people were trolling

but i actually

you know

you read through those replies

i do think like 10 of them were like dead serious

well

i think sometimes the trolling

and the laws reveal a thing we're too embarrassed to admit about the darker aspects of our nature

so i don't know if you listen to dan carlin's hardcore history podcast

he has a episode on painful payment

which he describes

throughout history

how humans have been really attracted to watching the suffering of others

so

um

public executions

all that kind of stuff

and he believes that's in all of us

that

for example

if something like a youtube or a different platform

stream to public execution or streamed the torture of another human being

a lot of people would

uh

say that's deeply unethical

but they will still tune in and watch and that

where we're attracted to that drama and especially the most extreme versions of that drama

and so i think part of the laws reveals something that's actually true in that poll that

like your answer is so much better than mine

do you think about that

maybe even with the squid game like

so

i think

how many

how many views

does this game currently have 300

million

yeah

something like this

so just imagine a thought experiment

how many views that video would get if it was like real

yes

because i mean youtube was like

we'll turn the blind out

we won't take it down

yeah

i mean it

i've obviously i probably have billions of views

how do you think you will die and do you think you'll be during a video

probably doing something dumb

like going to space when i'm in the older

like trying to go to mars or something like that

i know

for a fact

it won't be on a video

every video we do with safety experts and stuff like that

so it's not really risk

but um

yeah

i could see myself

like you know

after a million people go to mars or something like that

i'd probably be like

you know what let's go and and something like that

maybe so

not in the name of a video

just no for the holiday

heck

no

are you open to taking risks when you shoot videos

you just went to antarctica

i mean like you're

you're putting yourself in the line a little bit right

of course

but you know

we

we've had that video in the works for three years and then we consult with tons of experts

radar the entire path we're gonna walk beforehand to see if there's crevasses

so we know there's no crevasses

we do training

we consult with experts and we have survival guides there with us and you know

monitor to the weather and everything

so it's like any variable that where we could get harmed

we just pre-planned for it

same thing with buried alive

like i had david blaine spent a week underground

and so i consulted with him and consulted with basically anyone who ever buried themselves alive

you know the coffin we used to bury me we did so many tests

like that

coffin was buried 10 times before i was

you know

for a little way longer than 50 hours

it tested the airflow and everything to the point

where i was safer in that coffin underground than i was above ground

like

so we just tend to just not leave anything up to chance

you know

another strange question

then

so you've recorded these videos to yourself

you know

five years

ten years from now

have you recorded a video that's to be released once you die

well

first off

i am just glad that not every one of your questions have to do with like views

or things like that

it's nice getting different questions so this is

this is good

um

no

seriously stuck

but it's fine

because a lot of people just be like

how much money do you make

you know

it's just something

i

just

everything's always about money

now

for when people talk to me

so it's nice

um

but for the videos i made

uh

for you guys

who probably don't follow me too closely

when i had 8 000 subscribers and i was a teenager

i filmed a bunch of videos and scheduled them years in the future

and i said i'd filmed one where i was like

hi me in a year and the video went up a year later

and it was just like hey

i think you'll have 100 000 subscribers

and then i did one where i was

like

hire me in five years

i was like

hey

in five years

i think you'll have a million

and then one that hasn't come out yet

but it comes out in two years

is

was high me in 10 years

and i try to predict 10 years later

how many subs i'd have

that's what he's referring to

and yes

there

there are some that are scheduled like 20 years in the future

and so if i don't die

i'll just move them up

and i remember

because i filmed these though

like seven years ago

but

uh

it was

i remember saying a line like you know

if i'm dead

then i'm currently just in a coffin and like

whatever

blah

blah

because the only way the video go up is if i'm not alive and if i'm not alive

then i won't be able to push back to schedule upload date

so go public

automatically

yes

and so

yeah

i have a couple of those

uh

like

if i knew i was gonna die of like cancer or something

i had like three months to live

i would vlog every day

i'd film so many videos

and then i would just schedule upload a video a week for like the next five years

so it's like i'm still alive and i would completely act like i'm still alive and everything

and i think something like that would be cool

it's i don't know why

but i've fantasized

not fantasize

but i've dreamed about that

a lot

like

i don't know if

if i only had 30 days to live

what would i do

and for me i would try to make like a decades worth of content and schedule upload it

so they automatically go public in the future

and so it's just like i never died i'm just there

yeah

it's a kind of immortality

but it's also kind of troll on the concept of time

yeah

that you can die in the physical space but persist in the digital space

i actually i recorded a video like that

because i had some concerns and i just thought it's also a good exercise to do

a video would like to be released if i die

and it was actually a really interesting exercise

it's cool

like it shows like what you really care about

i guess it's like writing a will

but when you're younger

you don't think about that kind of stuff

but exactly mine was just dumb

yeah

like i'm bones in a coffin

yeah

yours is probably so serious

no

it's fun actually what you realize

it's like there's no point to be serious at this point

it's a weird thing

i guess you've done this

but it's a weird thing to address the world when you

the

physically

you

is no longer there

so

like you know

this would only be released if you're no longer there

exactly

that's a weird exercise

you know what's funny of all the people listening to this

yeah

you know

we're probably the only two people that have made videos for

when we die it's like such a niche thing

and the fact that we're bonding over

it's kind of funny

i think people should think about doing that

it's not just about youtube

it's also social media

because think about it like there's going to be a last tweet and the last

i don't know

facebook post

their last instagram post

and uh

yeah

i feel like there's some aspects that's meditative to just even considering making a post like that

and also it's a way for your

the people that love you to kind of like celebrate

do you think that would help them cope or not like

if someone randomly watching this did film a video

you know

for

if they accidentally died in some freak accident to be given to their family

do you think that would

and it was like a genuine

i think it would really help

i mean it depends

because like

how would you even intro that

like

hey

mom

if you're seeing this

you know

it means i'm probably dead

yeah

exactly

that's how you enjoy it

that's the opener

oh

i just want you to know

yeah

i guess

yeah

and i guess you could say in a kind of funny way

but um

and just talk about the things that you that mean a lot to you

because otherwise you're at the risk of the last post you have is like

like i don't know

talking shit about

like mcdonald's mcdonald's exactly

and then you're dead

that's it

100 years

i don't know this

i i do recommend it

it's uh

like the stoics

meditate on death every day

in the same way you kind of meditate in your death when you make a video like that

because it's actually not just even talking to yourself

it's talking to the world and it

like

for some reason

at least

for me

they made it very concrete that there's going to be an end and i'm like

it's almost

it's over for me

if i'm making the video

it's over for me

it's just an interesting thought experiment

i recommend people

um

uh

try it

okay

uh

from

are you afraid of death

by the way

yes

i i

it's hard because like what

if you just die and then you just see nothing forever

you know

yeah

the nothingness

it just fades the blackness

and you're just like that

for trillions upon trillions to billion squared years

and it's just

it's scary

but also before you're born

you don't remember those what x amount of years either

so

um

that gives me a little comfort

but no

it's definitely very scary

something i'd rather not think about until i'm like 80.

i'll deal with that problem

then

i i don't know if i told you this

but i'm kind of hopeful that someone like elon or one of these like freak

smart people will just like be like

you know what

screw it

i'm gonna figure out a way where we can slow down aging

get it where you know

we can live to be two

300 years old and just like set their sights on that

and then

just kind of save us

so it'd be really nice like it's

it's almost absurd to think

that in our lifetime they won't figure out a way to just even slightly slow down aging

where we could live to be like 120 or 130

and then that extra time

they won't figure out somewhere we could live to be 200.

like

obviously not immortal

but i don't

i don't see how in my lifetime

the life expectancy doesn't just expand

well

it also could be that the immortality is achieved in the digital realm

like it could be a long

be

long after you're gone

there's a mr beast

run by chad gbt type system

exactly

yeah

that consumes everything i ever said

everything i ever wrote and thought i don't want that

i want to live

what are you

smart people out there

figure it out

i'll keep you entertained

but i need you to figure out how to keep me alive

give me until 200. that will make me happy

well

that's

that's funny

who owns the identity of of mr beast wants

the physical body is gone

like

is it illegal to create another mr beast

that's chad gpt based

i don't know what the laws are on that

yeah

like

i mean

once i'm done i don't care

well

but you just said you did care

i mean there could be a ai

like many mr beasts that are created after after you're gone

yeah

i mean that would be cool to be able to like train up a model

and and let them loose

so my content lives on

i guess

yeah

yeah

but it somehow feels like it diminishes the video you contribute

yeah

yeah

it's an authentic

but it's also

there's

there's some aspect to the finiteness of the art being necessary for it

yeah

i want the second that thing starts spamming out videos

the videos lose all meaning and it's pointless

and it's a money grab

if you run youtube for

uh

how long should you run it for a year

uh

how would you change it

how would you improve

it

it's hard because you know

obviously i'm biased because we're doing really well

but i feel like when i open up youtube on my television

i get the videos i want to watch

i don't

i don't know

i don't

i don't ever open it and wonder like what are these

what are these 10 videos on my home page

when i click on video messages

i don't ever wonder what these are

like

i

i and maybe

it's because i'm very adamant about

like the kind of videos i watch

and i try not to watch videos that i don't want to get recommended more

because i just that's how i think

but i'm very happy with how it is

at the moment

i think one thing though that i just hate with the passion is the comment section on youtube

it's just so bad

um

but that i know that's not something that's gonna 10x the growth of the platform

but if you think about it

you go to reddit to read comments and somehow like that

you know usually the top 20 posts

uh

on a popular reddit post are not spam

you know what i mean

like

have you ever clicked on something on the front page of reddit

and then most upvoted reply to it is like go check out my site right here

and it's like trying to escape me out of a thousand dollars

yeah

yeah

i can't even think of one instance i've ever had that happen

so

like reddit

it's so nice to click on post and just see what people have to say

and i almost wish

like you had that same feeling when you read the comments a youtube video

instead

it's like it's so many people just copy

and pasting so many bots that just grab the top comment from your previous video and paste it over

so top comments on every videos are the same

and the things

that break through

that are just scammers trying to get you to give them a thousand dollars for a free

uh

you know

fake ad

that comment section is one of the most lively on the internet

so be amazing if youtube invested in creating an actual community like

where people could do high effort comments and be rewarded for it

like on reddit

yeah

like

actually right out along

that would make me so happy

because like when i upload a video

i usually go to twitter to see feedback

like i read my comments and i'll flip through newest

# Chapter 2

it's like it's so many people just copy

and pasting so many bots that just grab the top comment from your previous video and paste it over

so top comments on every videos are the same

and the things

that break through

that are just scammers trying to get you to give them a thousand dollars for a free

uh

you know

fake ad

that comment section is one of the most lively on the internet

so be amazing if youtube invested in creating an actual community like

where people could do high effort comments and be rewarded for it

like on reddit

yeah

like

actually right out along

that would make me so happy

because like when i upload a video

i usually go to twitter to see feedback

like i read my comments and i'll flip through newest

but it's just i feel like to read it

and twitter just give me so much better filtered feedback

especially now that

with twitter

blue

because people pay eight dollars a month

um

any

i've noticed

like any tweets i get from verified users now they're usually not just garbage troll takes

like these are people paying eight dollars a month

like they're usually relatively sensible

and so it's been pretty nice

like

after i upload my video

just go on the verified tab on twitter and just see what people have to say

and yeah

anyways

i live for the day that youtube's like that

uh

what do you think about twitter

what do you think about all the fun activity happening recently since

uh

elon

yeah

bought twitter

i think you should make me ceo like i tweeted

well

i should

i should say

sort of we had with

just like a couple hours ago

had a conversation with elon

and

uh

you guys had an exchange of some excellent ideas

so

yeah

i

i legitimately think obviously you're exceptionally busy

but i legitimately think it would be awesome if you somehow participate in the future of twitter

yeah

it would be fun because there's so much possibility of different ideas

first in the sort of the

uh

the content like dissemination

hosting and all the different recommendations like the search and discovery

all the things that youtube does

well

i think the most exciting thing is he's

you know

willing to move fast

and so i think there's going to be a lot of interesting things that come out of it

because he's just moving quick

and a lot of these more mature platforms just take years to do the simplest stuff

and they're very bureaucratic

and um

so it's gonna

i mean it'll be interesting to see which way it goes

when you just kind of take a move

quick break things

whatever type approach to social media

i'm actually pretty curious to see what futures he rolls out

so what will be your first uh

act as twitter ceo

i can't spoil it

okay

i gotta get hired

what do you think about video on the platform

i mean

yeah

do you think that's an interesting

or is it like messing with the the medium

the nature of the platform

i think twitter will always be closer to tick tock than it is to youtube

but i gotta

at least in this current form

i

i don't

i don't see 20 minute

one hour long videos or whatever

you know

even 15 minute videos being watched over there

i see it more as like the short and snappy stuff

closer to tick tock

but at the same time

twitter is a really good comment section for the internet

i mean it's almost weird

why

like

why doesn't twitter allow you to embed youtube videos

like

why

why does that

you should just ask elon that

like

i don't know if that's a youtube thing

but when

uh

youtuber posts the video

why do they have to link to youtube

why can't they just embed it on twitter and just play it there

i mean

wouldn't that just solve a lot of problems

yeah

but then the two companies that have to agree to integrate each other's content

i don't know

but it seems like a win-win i mean

well

it's more of a win for twitter

because then people don't have to leave the platform

i mean that would be the the easiest

but who gets

like

when you watch the ads on a youtube video that's embedded in twitter

who gets the money

it would still be youtube

but at least then

right now people just post a link

and it takes you off twitter and it just kills your session time on twitter

that's really interesting

but that

yeah

because the twitter

whatever the

the dynamics of the comments

especially once the spam bots are taken care of

twitter just works

it's really

so

reddit is a nice comment section for the internet

it's like slower pace

more deliberate

like a higher effort

twitter's like this high paced

like ephemeral kind of stream

but there's the vote

the upvoting

the downvoting works much better because you can do retweeting right

because the social network is much stronger than it is on youtube

like the interconnectivity

yeah

on reddit

you're gonna get the

the top replies are going to be the most refined ones

whereas twitter stuff floats to the top

that's not super refined

but

like you're saying

it's more off the cuff stream of consciousness

which a lot of people prefer gets a little more personal

how do you think twitter compares to youtube in terms of how you see its future unroll in 2023.

i mean i think youtube's gonna be youtube

and not much is really going to change

but it's going to keep growing just

because you know that's just what it does and because it's owned by google

um

but twitter

i don't know

i mean it's one of those things like you

you can't predict if i

you know

a year from now

an economy is going to be in a recession or booming

and i think twitter's kind of the same thing

one thing

for certain

a lot of things are going to be rolled out

but who knows honestly

you responded to elon saying twitter's unlikely to be able to pay creators more money than youtube

um

what do you think that is

well

yeah

because i i think the tweet i responded to is one where he was saying

um

that they

you know

users will jump over if twitter could potentially pay more

uh

than other platforms

and i was just saying

obviously

because google has google adwords and i mean that's google's whole thing

it's putting ads on stuff they've been doing it better

than anywhere else in the world for a very long time

it's very unlikely in the next few years that twitter is going to magically or any platform

you know

give a creator the ability to make higher cpms than on youtube

uh

it's

it's kind of crazy like some creators in in december

you know q4

because ad rates are higher because of christmas and everything

some creators literally make like 30

40 per thousand views

that's after youtube's cut like

it's almost like hard to think about

like how high the rpms get

and even then

once you pull out a financing cars

the highest cfm niches and you move into just normal stuff

it's still just crazy

the sheer volume of creators and the fact that all of them get these multi-dollar cpms at scales

it's pretty beautiful

so you do

i don't know what you would call them

but like integrated ads in your videos

and you do

i would say

masterfully

it's like part of the video you're talking about brand deals

brand deals

is that what you would call that

yep

so it's a brand deal

it's part of the video

it's still really exciting to watch

and yet there's a plug for the brand in general

just brand deals

since you brought it up

uh

integrating them

well

i think that's something a lot of creators don't do like

they'll just do a brand deal

out of the blue

they'll just be filming a video and then around the three minute mark

just start talking about a random company

yeah

and you

i feel like if you don't want viewers to click away

and you want people to not get pissed off and call you to sell out

you got to find a way to integrate in the content

and ideally use the money in the video to make it better

like

is the easiest thing you do

when you do a brand deal is just tell people how you're using money from the brand deal to make your content better

and if you do that

like

no one cares now they're supporting you for it

and you go from being a sellout to like

oh

i'm doing this to make better videos for you guys

you know

i don't know if you can share

but with those brands

when you have discussions with them

are they strict about how long you need to be talking about it

or is it more about their leaving control to you

about the artistic element of it

the problem is the the ones who don't give us the artistic element

we just don't really work with anymore

because it's just

you know

we get 100 million views of video now

and i can confidently say

i know how to entertain them and convert them better than these random brands

so

uh

yeah

if they don't give us that freedom

i just won't work with them

so you have that leverage

but for smaller creators

it's a lot harder

yeah

and they're

they're gonna just say 45 seconds

here's what you say

take it or leave it

and it's like pretty brutal

because i think

just in general

if brands were more accommodating

to let creators tell their story onto brandon

talk about the brand in a way that felt a little more natural

i i think it'd be less cringe it

people would be less likely to go

and you know

tough times

tap skip

and

uh

obviously it would convert better

but they're just so afraid and they want this standardized thing

say these words and 45 seconds

right here at this three minute mark

yeah

i often think about how to resist that

you just don't do them

though

right

not

on youtube

right

i do an audio

i do ads in the very beginning and i say you can skip them if you want

um

but brandon loves that i don't like the point is they

so the funny thing about podcasts is different than youtube videos

podcast

people actually do listen to ads a lot

because they it's slower paced and they like the the creator voice

like talking about the thing

um

but in general i just don't believe you should be talking about a thing for a minute exactly

and that's going to be effective

i want to see the data for that

i think what's much more fact

it was the way you do ads

which is like integrate into the content

like put a lot of effort into making a part of that

like doing the brand deals

and i just it's difficult to have that conversation

it's like a very strenuous conversation you have to have with with brands

you have to each one at a time

and i just wish there was more of a culture to say

like the quality of the ad read matters a lot more than the uh

like the silly parameters

like the timing of it

like how long it is the placement of it

all that kind of stuff

what percentage of your viewers do you think have seen one of my videos before

what percentage of the viewers on youtube

right

yeah

that's your viewers of the viewers on youtube

though

yes

okay

sure

or all of them

it's just interesting because you're

you're speaking very specifically

like about my brand deal process

and so in my head i'm like

i wonder what percentage of these people even have any idea what he's talking about

that's interesting

i love the thinking about numbers the whole time we're having this conversation

it's all i could think about is like god damn it

he's

there's

probably like 50 of these people have no fucking clue what he's saying

and we're about to torture him for five minutes

yeah

yeah

probably

but that's something i can't turn off in my brain

less than 50 is that a good thing or a bad thing

is that exciting to you that that there's like 50 of people

don't

i've not watched the mr beast video

isn't that an opportunity like

yeah

i guess there's an opportunity to grow

i don't know

honestly

i was just kind of excited to hang out with you

yeah

yeah

me

too

i mean

who cares

yeah

so it's kind of like having a buddy to go along the journey

as i'm just kind of eating shit and doing my normal ride

it was like kind of fun and also you just say really wise stuff constantly

okay

so

honestly

no

i never even put any thought into

like that

demographics of what i could gain

it's just interesting

because

like my retention brain

when you talk about something i'm instantly like

hmm

what value are they gonna get

how many of them are going to be interested

what percentage of people do

i think we'll lose

and i'm like running all those calculations in the background and that whole conversation

like the law is anyway

it's just something i can't turn off my

like bells were like

this is bad

what are the different strategies for high retention for your videos in general

it's like

how do you cook good food

you know what i mean

that's like the same kind of question i see

so there's so many different ways that you

so it boils down to

i mean

uh

do you think it's at the level of a story

or do you think like literally watching five seconds at a time

am i gonna tune out here

am i gonna tune out here

am i going to tune out here

that's all of it

you need the overarching narrative and then you also need the micro

where every second you know needs to be entertaining

and you

basically

what's interesting is the longer people watch something

the more likely they are to keep watching

so you don't have to try as hard in the hypothetically back half of a video as you do in the front like

even right now we're so deep into this

where a lot of people listening are probably just going to keep listening relatively close to the endless

we just have a really boring part of this conversation because they're just they're saying it

they're

they're immersed

um

and so a big like to really boil it down to a simple level

you just want to get people

where they're immersed in the content and then just kind of hold them there

we had this discussion offline and by the way

i should mention that this is like late at night

it is what times

it's uh

nine o'clock and i

uh

i only slept one hour last night because i'm an idiot and i flew to the wrong location

well here we're like

hey

book your hotel on a flight

he's like

no

i got it

we're like you

sure

we can just do it

we always do this

he's like

no

i got it

i got it

he's gonna have to rub it in

i know

and then today i come to find out

he flew to the wrong airport

the airport with the uh

our city with a similar name to ours

the same name

same name in a different state

and i was like that's why you should let us book it

and so he saw one hour of sleep and he's literally been dying all day before this podcast

he downed like two things of coffee

we've been going all day hard

uh

yeah

i've been

uh

got to interact with you

i should say that this gave me an opportunity to

i gotta

uh

ride from a stranger and it was an incredible person that got to interact with them

so it's like there's so many kind people around here

just like this kind of southern energy

and then i got to go to a diner because i could you know

there's only one hour between me arriving and having to fly out

so i went to a diner

there's a really kind waitress that called me

uh

honey

so that's a beautiful moment

you know

i was so confused

you tweeted about that and like steel's like

like my assistant

uh

lex isn't here yet and i saw your tweet and i was like he's here

he was like

no

he's still flying

i was like four

like an hour ago

he just tweeted about a nice diner

yeah

it was a diner

it was a diner in a different state

and then you had to fly

over here

yeah

that was

and then i called you

you didn't answer

i was like something's not had enough

yeah

i feel like it's such an idiot because

um

apparently the world

uh

has cities like springfield

right

like there's like

every single state has a springfield

oh

really

but i think so

i think that's whatever

that's like a simpsons joke

right that

like

it's uh

the the city and and the simpsons of springfield

and i think every single state or most of them have a springfield

and the same is true for

like

uh

georgetown

i think the most part

i forget what the most popular one was

but there's like a list of these people get when they run out of ideas

they just keep us

if they're your achilles heel

anyway

i got to

i got to meet a bunch of people from

uh

from your team

it's just an incredible human being

so let me just ask on that topic

how do you hire a great team like

what have you learned about hiring for

um

everything for it for the main channel that you do

uh

for the

the

react again

uh

the the gaming channel to

uh

mr beast burger to

uh

feastables

all that the big thing is especially in this content creation

because it's not like anything that's done on netflix or or different

uh

content

medians

i

i really need people who are coachable and like

really see the value in what i care about

because it's a very specific way of going about things

and it's a like a thing

there's no one like plug and play

like

if netflix wanted to hire someone to do a documentary

there's probably tens of thousands of people you could hire that have worked on documentaries before

but if you want to hire someone to make super viral youtube videos

you know

like we do

there's just no one you you can really pull from

like

sometimes i'll hire people from

uh

game shows right

they have all these preconceived notions about pacing and how a video should be

and you have to spend like the first year like breaking all these habits

and you know

and they think they're better than you

like

a lot of people in traditional think they're better

and they think their way is better than what we do

and so for me it's almost easier to hire people that are just hard workers that are obsessed

and really coachable and just train them how to like

be good at content creation production than to hire someone from like traditional

which is the only way to really do it

because there's not that many youtube channels that have scaled up

so it's not like there's a huge talent pool of people who've worked on youtube channels

um

so it's easier just to train someone than just pull them from traditional

because traditional people

just i don't know they have all these opinions

and things and they just think our way of going about things is dumb

yeah

so you want people who have the humility to have a beginner's mind

even if they have experience

see the value like actually

you'll still get it

it's so crazy

like especially some of my other friends that are skilling up their youtube channels

# Chapter 3

a lot of people in traditional think they're better

and they think their way is better than what we do

and so for me it's almost easier to hire people that are just hard workers that are obsessed

and really coachable and just train them how to like

be good at content creation production than to hire someone from like traditional

which is the only way to really do it

because there's not that many youtube channels that have scaled up

so it's not like there's a huge talent pool of people who've worked on youtube channels

um

so it's easier just to train someone than just pull them from traditional

because traditional people

just i don't know they have all these opinions

and things and they just think our way of going about things is dumb

yeah

so you want people who have the humility to have a beginner's mind

even if they have experience

see the value like actually

you'll still get it

it's so crazy

like especially some of my other friends that are skilling up their youtube channels

there's people that will come on and you'll ask them like

what do you want to be doing in five years

and instead of saying

oh

i want to be working on this channel

they'll be like

oh

i hope to be workout movies or this

and they see like working on a youtube channels

the launch pad to go into traditional and it's like

no

like you just don't get it

this is the future is the end goal

this is your career

um

and so i'm just so tired of having those kinds of conversations like

i feel like people really should be coming around

are there like recurring interview questions that you ask is there is there ways to get

yeah

the biggest thing is like what do you want to be doing in 10 years and their answer isn't

you know

making content on youtube

or you know if their answer is anything like movies or traditional stuff like that

it's like just a hell

no

like it just won't even remotely work

oh

so you really want people to believe in the vision of youtube

yeah

i mean

ideally

it's like

oh

working here

you know what i mean

so it's less about the medium and more about just being on a great team that's doing epic stuff

yeah

well

and yeah

the media as well

because those it's just it's hard to put into words

but there's

it's just two completely different ways of going about things you know

like our videos aren't scripted and you know it's a lot more run and gun and when we

if we hypothetically blow up a giant car or whatever

like

you only have one take

you know

i mean

so

um

and it's not scripted

and so you have to over film

overshoot things over compensate for

like the dumb way of going about it

a lot of traditional people would be like

well

just plan what you're gonna say and just playing the angles

you can cut the cameras in half you can save 50 grand

here

you can save

you know

75

000

editing this and that and it's like

yeah

but that's not authentic like that's

you know

but you

you get it

it's

it's almost so obvious that it hurts to have to like

constantly have these conversations

but so where we live in

but there's also detail like there's a taste

like i've watched a bunch of videos with you and it's clear to you that you've gotten really good

i don't know what the right word is

style or taste

to be able to know what's good

and not in terms of retention

in terms of

yeah

just stylistically

visually

i don't have to think

i can just watch a video and it just it just screams in my head like this is what

this is what should change

based on the you know million videos i've watched and all these viral videos are consumed

like this is

blah

blah

what's optimal and things like that

it's almost like your brain's like a

you know

like a neural net

like if you consume enough viral videos and enough good content that you just kind of start to like

train your brain to like

see it and see these patterns that happen in all these viral videos

and so that

anytime i watch a video or a movie or anything

i just can't stop thinking about what is optimal

and so it's like it gives me a headache

sometimes when i watch something too slow or i don't think it's optimal

obviously my taste isn't the end-all feel

um

but that's something that kind of torments me

if that makes any sense

oh

you can't enjoy a slow moving

no

i can't movie and and that's not to say

there's attention on the godfather is horrible

yeah

no

exactly

i've tried to watch that movie like three times but and that's not to say

slow movies are bad

like there's an audience for it

it's just obviously not what i've trained my brain to like

and and social media and youtube

right now

like that's just not the meta and in general

like you said

in neural network

you're training your brain in part on actual data

right

so you're actually

it's data driven

so you're looking at like in terms of thumbnails and titles and different aspects of the first five

ten seconds and then throw out the video

the retention

all that you're looking at all that

uh

for your own videos

to understand how to do it better

so that's where the neural network is training

yeah

basically there are ways you can kind of see

like the most view videos on youtube every day

and stuff like that

and i just kind of consume those every single day

and i've been doing that for way too many years

and then you just start to notice patterns like the thumbnails on the most view videos

or videos that go super viral

tend to be clear

tend to not have much clutter

tend to be pretty simple

titles

tend to be less than 50 characters

intros tend to be this

stories tend to be this

and you just kind of like after you see those thousands and then tens of thousands of time

it just starts to click in your head like this is what it looks like

you know

so how are you able to transfer that taste that you've developed to the team

so for like

because you said like broad things

but i'm sure there's a million detailed things like what zoom to use on the face to use in the thumbnail

right

like the answer is

whatever makes the best video

because the problem is the more

which i have so many friends who are like this

they'll make like checklists for their editor or something like you know

uh

this be in this beat and you need to have

like a three part arc

and then this

but the

the problem is

that's how you

the

the more constraints you put on the team

the more repetitive and less innovation you get

and the more like you know

after 10 videos

people are gonna be like

all right

i've already seen this

so to me and i'm 24

and you know i'm probably

my mindset will change over the next 10 years

i just haven't been in this industry too long

but the only way to like

really make innovative content and keep things fresh

is to not put constraints on or put as little as possible

and so that's why i'm very hesitant on all that stuff

because the more i say

the more they're gonna be like

oh

then that's what we do

and then you know

i'll say one time like

oh

you know

ideally

there's a cut every three seconds and the next thing you know

every video

there's like cut every three seconds or whatever

so it's it's hard because i try to give uh

as little train

not training but as little

uh

facts or as possible

and more

just make suggestions

if that makes any

you mean publicly or to your team

to my team

yeah

what's so we talked about

sort of uh teaching your voice or your style

whatever we want to call it to other people on the team

so they can be kind of a mr beast replacement

so what's the process of teaching that

so you don't wanna

no

you're more talking about like

uh

what i would call almost like cloning right like

like tyler and other things like that

yeah

so

when we were hanging out today

i was showing him how we have multiple people and they come

it's

it's almost like talking to the cameras

yeah

it turns slowly to the camera

i was like

anyways

have

it is it weird to you to not be looking at the camera

this whole interview

i constantly have been turning towards the camera like

yeah

i'm talking to him

yes

it's a habit

uh

because my whole life i've just been talking to a camera

who are you thinking about when you're looking at the camera

do you like

imagine somebody

i'm fully thinking about

the person just sitting watching it

and i almost

it's weird

but i'm looking at the camera

i don't see a camera

i'm like in a haze

picturing what the viewer is seeing when they watch it

yeah

that makes sense

and that's where i'll be saying things and or doing something and then

like when i'm watching

i'm like

that's not what i want

and then i'll freeze up

it's very weird when i'm filming

and then for people who haven't worked with me too much

they'll think

like

i don't know

it's very weird

like the how i go about it

because i'll just be doing whatever

like lighting a firework

all right

this is a thousand dollar firework

i'll go to lighting and i'll like freeze

because in my head i'm like this

i don't know

i don't like how that float or how that shot looked

because i

it's weird

i can perfectly picture what i'm filming

by just looking at the camera and then putting myself through the lens of the camera while making content

and i can do it at the same time

so you're like real time editing in my video

yeah

that's something that didn't at the start

come natural to me

but in the last

probably like five years it's happened

and so i would say it's one of my greatest strengths

but i don't know how i developed it

but anytime i'm filming anything like

it's almost like the like right side of my brain i just can just look at it

and i see exactly what i'm filming and i can just picture it

well

there's probably recording the video being the talent for the video

and then watching the editing and like analyzing you careful and do that over and over again

you'll do that over and over you

ten thousand times

yeah

you do the editing more than the being in front of the camera

so

like you

you start to see yourself from that third person perspective

exactly

then

maybe that actually helps with the nerves of it

too

like you see it as creating a video versus performing

uh

right

yeah

yeah

i think

so

you know

i

it's weird i've never been nervous talking to a camera

it's it's harder for me to talk to a person that doesn't talk to a camera

which i feel like a lot of people say that

though that are whatever

make content right

interesting

i've heard that so many times

or maybe not

maybe i'm just awkward enough

maybe they're practiced

i

to me

it's

i mean both are terrifying

but being in front of the camera by yourself is so much easier

really

yeah

so much easier

i preferred a million times over [applause] but that's my whole life

you know

so it's just that's why it's interesting

like you've spent more of your time talking to people

yeah

it comes natural

and i talk to a piece of plastic

oh

yeah

i guess you're talking to a person too

they're just then on the other side of the camera

yeah

there's just a pixel on the screen

so so cloning

how do you

how do you achieve this

oh

yeah

that's right

that's all right

so i was showing him

that i have a lot of people in the company who are able to think like me

and

uh

basically make decisions like i would make if i was like

if you were asked

hey in this video

should we climb a mountain

or should we dig a hole right

and like you know

they would pick the same answer

i'd pick 90 plus percent of the times

and so one example is tyler who i was showing you

and he was pitching some content and you could see it like this

he was on point and

uh

basically

for just four or five years

we just spent an absurd amount of time together and worked on every single video together and we worked

uh

side by side

and same thing with

uh

my ceo

james

he literally lived with me for a couple years

i'm a big fan of

just like finding people who are super obsessed and all in and a players that you know

they really just want to be great and then just dumping everything

and

like you were saying

because i'd love to find that

uh

and develop that you're saying

you're basically

for a long time

just said everything you were thinking to them

exactly like

uh

james

the the guy who's basically my right handman right now

um

for two years he lived with me and we probably talk on average of those two years

seven hours a day

i mean

anytime i had a phone call

i'd throw it on speaker and i'd let him listen anything

i was reading any content i was consuming

like really just

training his brain to think like me

so that way

um

he could just do things without my input without me having to constantly watch over him

or give him advice

and

and that's where we've gotten like

so for the first six months he didn't do anything

he just studied me and studied everything i cared about and how i spoke

and blah

blah

and then the next six months he started taking on some responsibilities

and now he can just run the company

and you know i don't ever really have to check in on him like i

most

the decisions he makes are exactly what i would do

um

and so i i call that cloning i don't know what other people would

but it's just like finding people that are really obsessed

and they just kind of really want it and just being like giving them an avenue to like

get it

if that makes any sense

another way to see it is

you're converging towards a common vision

and that makes like brainstorming much more productive

yeah

it just makes it where i don't have to be so involved in everything

because i just have these people i know

will think like

i will

uh

at least relatively close to it

so i can kind of almost be in multiple places at once per se

and so these things that you know

i still approve every idea we film and you know everything before we film it all the creative

i approve it

but i don't have to like

be in the weeds and nuances and do all this minor stuff

i can just let them handle it

i can just do the more macro things

i got a chance to sit in to a lengthy brainstorming session with tyler and others

that was really cool

can you talk about the process of that of

uh

people pitching ideas and you pitching alternatives or shutting down ideas

and it's just going like plowing through ideas

very good

i mean you kind of just describe exactly what we did

yeah

i mean

but the ideas are really really good

it's just tossing out like different categories of ideas and then also fine-tuning them to see

like you know

i changed

like thinking about the titles and the stuff i worked so well off of inspiration

it's like that's a something like give

give me anywhere

i don't know space

yeah

like i went to space

you know what happens if you love a nuke in space

or i went to the moon

i went to mars

right

because you said that one word

it was able to inspire me to come up with four ideas

and so that's just it's for me if you the way to get 100 million views on videos

you need something original

creative

something people really need to see

ideally

never been done before all these like things

and so you need like

if you want to consistently go supervisor

you need just a constant stream of ideas

and the only way i've really found

that i can consistently come up with 100 million view videos is to intake inspiration

and then see what my brain outputs

and so that's kind of at its core foundation

what i'm doing there is just like in taking a lot of random inspiration to see what spawns in my mind

so i can output it

but the neural network of your brain is generating the video

the title

the thumbnail

all that jointly

exactly

and that only comes because i spent 10 years of my life just obsessively studying all that stuff

because you

i mean it seems like you would literally potentially shut down a video just

because you can't come up with a good title

yeah

or a thumbnail

yeah

i mean that's what happened to 70 of those in that pitch session

i was just like

oh

what was one of them genius versus 100 people or

yeah

like

maybe average intelligence versus genius

yeah

i was like

what the heck is the thumbnail

even if the title was good

yeah

yeah

i mean there's so many

but yeah

people don't click

they don't watch

that's so interesting

but you developed over time

the ability to kind of give it

what

what makes for a good title short

not just short

it's also

i mean if someone reads it

are they like

do they have to watch it

is it just so intrinsically interesting that it's just gonna fuck with them if they don't click on it

you know what i mean

so it doesn't have to be short

but it has to be like

you almost want to have a retention to word by word reading

ideally

it's a title also that

um

you know

because the titles don't live in a vacuum

right

so it has to lead into the content

so ideally

the title represents content that you would want to watch for 20 minutes

so if it's a 20 minute video and the title is

i stepped on a bug

it's not gonna

because it's all of it combined

it's the click-through rate is going to be much lower

and then

if it was like a five second video

people might click it

so you gotta like

even nuances of the length of the video

based against the title will affect whether people want to click it

because sometimes they just all add up

i mean it's that

yes

ideally

you want it below 50 characters

because above 50 characters

on certain devices

you run the chance of it going

dot

dot dot

so

like i took a light pole

and i saw how many dollar bills i could stack on top and they would just go dot dot

because it's too long and it can't finish it

and that's the worst thing

because then people don't even know what they're clicking on and so it's going to do even worse

um

short

simple

ideally

and just so freaking interesting

they have to click

and it is a good segue into the content and represents the length of the content

and there's probably stuff

it's hard to kind of convert into words for you

like i stepped on a bug versus stepping in a bug versus mr b stepped on the bus

well

i mean that bug stepping that up

so it's like

yes

the more extreme the opinion

typically

the higher the click-through rate

if you can

like

uh

pay it off in the content

then it just supercharges it

so like

oh so you have a kind of estimate of the experience

this water

right

if you're like fiji water sucks

yeah

that would do fine

but if you said fiji water is the worst water bottle or the worst water

i've ever drank in my life

yeah

way more extreme opinion would do way better

but you have to deliver

yeah

but then you have to deliver

because the more extreme you are

the more extreme you have to be in the video

yeah

that's almost inspiration for you to step up

yeah

# Chapter 4

then it just supercharges it

so like

oh so you have a kind of estimate of the experience

this water

right

if you're like fiji water sucks

yeah

that would do fine

but if you said fiji water is the worst water bottle or the worst water

i've ever drank in my life

yeah

way more extreme opinion would do way better

but you have to deliver

yeah

but then you have to deliver

because the more extreme you are

the more extreme you have to be in the video

yeah

that's almost inspiration for you to step up

yeah

but you can

you can be more extreme in a positive way

a lot of people

it's easier

though

pause it

uh

negative

clickbait is much easier than positive cliff

it just is

it's so much easier to get negative clicks

and so a lot of people are just in my opinion

you know

a little bit lazier and they just take the route like

oh

well this one gets the same amount of clicks and it's easier

less effort

the positive one is doing a large number of numbers of something

like i

i spent this number of hours doing this or whatever

if you just wanted to help people or right

it's just harder to get 10 million views on a video helping people

than it is to get 10 million views on a video tearing down a celebrity

you know what i mean or whatever negative video you want to insert there

well

that said

most of your videos are pretty positive

so what's

but not a lot of people do those kinds of videos because they're hard

yeah

they're hard

some of that is giving away money

right

yeah

um

what's the secret to that

what's how do you do do that

right

yeah

like give away money or in a video that made to make it compelling

um

is it

so there's a number that is better than another number

right

the higher number is always better than the other number

yeah

for the most part

and you know it's interesting

like some videos will give away a million dollars

some videos will give away half a million

there's not really

i guess

so i'm retracting what i just said

i was more joking with that

but there's no difference whether i put 500k or a million

it's probably not even really a difference between 100k a million

i haven't really looked into it

like some of our mostly videos are not us giving away a million dollars

and sometimes the million dollar videos just don't do as well as the other ones

so there there's a certain point

where a dollar amount is just a large dollar amount to an average human

and so i think that point is 100k

like anything above 100k

the average human's just like that's a lot of money

you know it

doesn't

it doesn't 100k a million like it doesn't really move the needle

if that makes sense

which that's a very nuanced piece of information that applies to very few people

but yeah

well

no

i think it applies

it's fascinating

it's fascinating

human

our relationship with money is fascinating like

why is it so exciting to get

i mean i

you know

the times i found like 20 bucks in the ground are like incredible

really

i don't know why

right

why

why are you so happy

like

what exactly is so joyful about that

i mean it depends where you are in life

what the situation is

yeah

i don't know

there's also a gamified aspect to it it's exciting

yes

no

i get it

like why people want to see people win money

it's just interesting that past 100 grand

it's

it doesn't really seem to make a difference

like it's the same

basically

so you found

that to be true with all the money you've given away that i just didn't click through it

like obviously in terms of someone receiving it

yeah

a million dollars changes their life drastically

more

like

that's the difference

like

oh you

if you wanted to

you could really quit your job as opposed to 100k is like not really

you probably do

like a scientific study

like a formula giving away money to click-through rate

yeah

there could be some kind of digestion return

it definitely the

the returns level off dramatically after 100k

that's basically the premise

what about ten thousand

uh

no

there's ten

a hundred thousand

is that it's funny because this is such a small niche thing

but yeah

100 000 does it from what i see in our videos get more clicks than ten thousand

but the difference between a hundred thousand million is just so little

i just i think

big number

big number to a lot of people past that point

yeah

so for 100

000

you can like give an average salary

you could probably live for a year given give them a day out

average salaries in america

so that's like a big

that feels

yeah

i think it's also just more when they read the title

it's just like it's a lot of zeros

fuck loads of zeros

okay

click

yeah

oh man

that's fascinating

so on the thumbnail side again

that's going to be much harder to say

probably

um

but you know

offline

you know i got a chance to look at a bunch of thumbnails and it's fascinating

which ones do well

and which ones don't is there something you could say about what are the elements of a thumbnail

that work well

is this also deeply

well

that's where

yeah

it's the same thing like

how do you cook good food

but um

it's easier if you pull up a thumbnail

i could be like

that's why that's good

that's why that's bad

that's uh

like an example would be like one of my friends

i was

he just uploaded a video recently and i called him

i was like

what is this because he's a very

very smart guy

and then the thumbnail

he's

he's getting chased by cops

but the cops are wearing yellow vests

so they didn't look at cops

i was like

whoa

why are the cops in your thumbnail wearing yellow vests

it's like that makes it so much more boring

and he was like carrying a flag

but the poll and the color of the flag were the same color

so it's like it's a lot harder to see the flag

i was like

also

you're wearing like a shirt with like five different colors like

so it's like it's hard to tell what even what your outline is

and then in the background there were cars and i was like

oh

if you have cops chasing you

why not make the cars cop cars and you know and it's like

because in my head i'm like

dang

if he just did those

like four or five things

the video probably got

like seven next the views

how much iteration

because i also got a chance to see the number of iterations you do on a on

just it's a problem

now it's an addiction

is it

so you kind of

there's

a lot of the versions were really good

yeah

how do you know when to like

i love how you

when we pulled up that

uh

the burger one and we were flipping through them

you're like

that's really good

i was like

oh

that's version like one of like a thousand

but even the sketch

the idea was good

like already

even the original idea is strong

yeah

so we

one of our coming up videos

we made the world's largest plant-based burger

and the thumbnail we were thinking is like me standing beside the bird

because it's six feet tall

that's that's what he's talking about

so like

just picture a giant six foot tall burger super wide

thousands of pounds

and then i'm beside it

and then it's like eating the world's largest burger like you

that's just something you have to click like

so you were saying

like how would you describe a good thumbnail like that

you know what i mean like

but i think you said the one i noticed first that was good

where you were very small in it relative to the

and you didn't like that one

i needed to come forward a little bit

and also the photo we took was

uh

just my upper body

yeah

so they photo manipulating created my legs

photoshop

and that's why i said i didn't like it

because my right leg was a little like off

it was like bent the wrong way

does the physics and thumbnail have to even make sense

i mean you can just like exaggerate the head size and all that kind of yeah

100

yeah

things don't have to be relative

yeah

you can have a car in the background be three times the size

yeah

because

yeah

every one of my thumbnails

my face is in the you know

left side

very big

so brand recognition

so just people know

oh

especially because now that a lot of people copy our videos

it's just nice to like you know

everyone else might make thumbnails like this

but this is mine and obviously we usually over deliver and do bigger stuff

would you recommend to other creators that wanna that

wanna make it big to

and they see mr beast

and they look up to you to copy some elements of you or to really try to be unique

unique

100

unique

you're not the next mr beast quote

feels weird saying that third person

but whatever is not gonna do what i'm doing better

they're gonna just invent their own lane

like you're just not going to do what i do

better than me

you know

i have so many

i literally have the best people in the world working here and i

i reinvest everything i make even to this day

you know what i mean

like

it's absurd

the amount of money i spent on content and i don't care

i'll just stop sleeping

and i'll just film every other day like you're just not gonna beat me at my own game

and that's fine

you shouldn't

like i didn't get where i am by just beating someone else out there again

i just found my own lane and innovated and adapted and so yeah

there's a lot of people that do copy me

and it's fine

whatever do it

but just know you're not gonna get to where i am doing that

um

and so i'd advise you

don't you give away a lot of the secrets

basically everything

yeah

about how you operate

is there

uh

i don't hold anything back

go for it

you know

how do you think about that

because that's also

that's pretty rare

i think

and this is a definitely not

uh

most people in my stance

i don't think would take this or my position would take this stance

but i see every other youtuber or so person on social media

even because we're also focused super heavily on youtube

but last year we're also the most followed tick tock creator in the world

as well

i actually remember most subscribed to youtube channel world and the most followed tick tock account in the world

um

but

uh

in general

i just see everyone else

as uh collaborators

not competitors

i

i don't think giving advice and helping other creators do well in any way harms me

and i think it only brings more value to my life

how is it jumping on tick tock and trying to understand that platform from scratch

yeah

so

from being a successful youtuber to understand a totally different algorithm

fundamentally different algorithm

it's interesting

well

not even just the algorithm

just the content

like i'm going from basically 15 minute short films to one sub

one minute

vertical content

at least a whole different

just ballpark

um

and so the first little while is doing tick tock

it was just kind of figuring out how what does mr beast look like in this short form content

but recently we've really started to catch our stride

and come up with some original concepts and figure out how to innovate over there

just like we did on youtube

because i don't want it

i didn't want it to just be shitty youtube videos

yeah

you know

and so

like an example is

um

we played the rock for 100k and rock paper scissors and the loser had to donate 100k to charity

we did

um

we went to random people on a campus and we offered them

so i said i'll give you a hundred dollars if you fly to paris

to give me a baguette

and then they said no

and i was like i'll give you 300 if a lot of hairs and give me a big hat

and i was expecting this person to say no and it go up to like 10 grand

he's like yes

and so he flew to paris

got a baguette and brought it back and gave it to me

and that across everything got like 450 million views

and because it's just really cool just to see this random guy get on a plane

spend a day in paris and we cut it up real nicely and bring it back

and so we're starting to find just tons of original content over there

but it seems like an epic video to make for one minute

exactly

no one on short forms doing it

that's the thing

it's like okay

it's just so funny

because like tick tock's been big for a while now years

and then

um

you know

as

as we started to really figure out things on the youtube channel and get it cranking

where i have some free time

we

we set our sights on tick tock and like okay

what are people not doing

how do we make it better

put in more effort

make it good

and we did the same thing we did at youtube

just different over on tick tock and it worked

and now we're the fastest growing or most followed tick tock account in 2022

and it's just funny that no one else did that

and you're not afraid to do epic stuff

which also during the brainstorming

some of the ideas you're like

that's better as a short

that's crazy

yeah

can you remember one

because i remember i said that a bunch

but i can't think of what

all i remember is that they were like epic videos

like

really

you're going to do that for a one minute video

yeah

that's crazy

so like

are you posting similar content to a youtube short

as a tick tock

yeah

those would just double up

it's just hard

you know

what's actually pretty fascinating in people who do social media

listening to this will probably find this pretty interesting

because the picture of like the content creation meta three years ago versus now

where you can make sub one minute

vertical content and it go viral on tick tock and go viral on youtube

shorts

go viral on instagram

reels

it goes viral on facebook

it goes reddit

you know you swipe through vertical content now and twitter

when you click on a video and you flip through it

so this is actually very weird

this is the first time in the history of

i guess western social media

that one form of content could actually go super viral on every single platform

it's never been like that before

so they're going viral individually

they're not like like something or whatever

i can post something on tick tock

they'll get 100 million views and then post it on shorts

and it'll get 200 million views and then post it on instagram

and i get 50 million views and then you know i haven't yet

but you know you can then turn around

and tweet it and get tens of millions of views and you can post it on reddit

get tons of interviews

and

and facebook and get tens of millions of views and that that just wasn't a thing three years ago

twitter didn't have when

because a lot of you probably don't even know this

but when you tap on a video now and you swipe down

it just turns into tick tock

that wasn't a thing even a year ago

reddit

that wasn't a thing a year ago

probably two years ago

that wasn't a thing on instagram

three years ago

that wasn't a thing on youtube

right with youtube shorts

so this is all new

and

uh

i don't

it's weird

i haven't heard a single person talk about it

but this is the first time

where content can actually go viral on every single platform

and you don't have to write or film a video for facebook film

a 12 minute video for youtube film

a sub 60 second video for tick tock

write a tweet for twitter and post this on reddit

you can just do the same thing on every platform

and the fact that your content has gone viral on multiple platforms regularly means that virality is not accidental

sometimes it can be

of course

but it's

it's just it can be engineered

it's

yeah

so many people say it's luck

and they're like you're just lucky or this or that

but what are we up to

probably like a thousand videos over 10 million views

like we don't ever have a dud like you can call it luck

but i think it could be trained

i

i counsel youtubers all the time

and show them how to go from getting a couple million views a month to 10 million views a month

very easily

if i'm even certain

ones

like just one of my friends

like he was just really struggling

and so i just started showing him basically everything i know and just doing like once every week

sometimes

once every two weeks

calls and it went from ten thousand dollars a month on youtube to over four hundred thousand

just doing these little counseling calls

and so i mean people can make excuses all they want

and say it's just luck or say you know

um

well

anyways

i don't even want to quote all the other stuff

but it's just it is

it is a teachable skill

it's a learnable skill

you can study your way to consistently make viral videos

no matter how small your channel is

even if you have zero subscribers

you could

if

if you actually studied hard enough and like

basically

if you knew what i knew

and some of these

so i don't sound so arrogant

also

like some of these other friends i have that i'd say are the smartest people in the world

when it comes to content creation online

if you had the knowledge that was in our heads

you could do it very easily

i see people do it all the time

um

and what's even more interesting is i go on podcasts and i say everything i know

and these people are also very open

some of them

i know it's all out there and a lot of people

instead of just studying that and trying to absorb and apply it in their own way

they're just like

no

it's just luck

you know

so you do lay it all out there

but i gotta push back to one interesting thing

i

i think a crucial component of your success is the idea stage

the idea generation

the brainstorm i heard today

but getting really good at generating idea is

so it's not

it's not just the uh

the selection of the thumbnail and the title

that creative process

it's also just the the engine of generating really good ideas

of course

and getting that

i mean

i i would say

that is probably the thing that needs to be trained the most for most creators

right that

they're

they just don't put enough ideas on paper

yes

but also a lot of creators also

just

don't

you know

which i didn't either

for the longest time

just didn't don't make good enough content

you know

content

that's worthy of getting 10 million views in the idea or the execution of the idea

both

i mean

like

think about how many people just make videos they film in under 20 minutes

and they don't really put any effort into it

and like you know

it's like my first 500 videos didn't deserve to get a million views

like there's a reason they did

they're terrible

you know

but at the time i thought they did right now i'm in the mindset of a lot of small youtubers

or i thought those videos deserved a million views

and i thought the algorithm hated me

but i watched them back now and i can tell you exactly why the videos was fucking horrible

you know what i mean

well

so what was the breakthrough for you to start realizing

to start having a self-awareness you know about these videos aren't good enough

# Chapter 5

content

that's worthy of getting 10 million views in the idea or the execution of the idea

both

i mean

like

think about how many people just make videos they film in under 20 minutes

and they don't really put any effort into it

and like you know

it's like my first 500 videos didn't deserve to get a million views

like there's a reason they did

they're terrible

you know

but at the time i thought they did right now i'm in the mindset of a lot of small youtubers

or i thought those videos deserved a million views

and i thought the algorithm hated me

but i watched them back now and i can tell you exactly why the videos was fucking horrible

you know what i mean

well

so what was the breakthrough for you to start realizing

to start having a self-awareness you know about these videos aren't good enough

you're probably still going through that you're probably still growing to see like

yeah

every six months

you should look back and hate your videos or at least see things you could improve and be like

oh

i could have done this better

that

better

if not

then you're not learning quick enough in my opinion

at least where's the source of that learning even for you now

uh

just look at it

i just got back from him

no

i'm

i just got back from a mastermind where i just got

like you know

10 of the smartest people i knew

and we just locked ourselves in a cabin and taught each other stuff constantly

every day

not every day

now

probably every other day

i go on a walk and i just call random people

i'll just say teach me something

and

uh

i mean it's just

uh

you just have to have a never-ending thirst for learning link

that's very imperative

especially if you want

like

if you want to get on top and then stay on top

the only way to do it is just to constantly be learning

or someone who is learning is just gonna

you know

have a leg up on you in the knowledge game

and what kind of stuff

are you because you you've talked about offline that you just love learning of all kinds

it doesn't matter

but in terms of videos

are you studying

videos

are you studying recently

not as much

i'm more

because to get to the videos i want

i have to build this business

and scale up

and hire so one of my recent time has been like my teenage years were spent studying virality

and studying content creation

now i'm studying how to build a content company so i can actually produce the crazy ideas i want to produce

if that makes any sense

so

yeah

and that's the business side

uh

we talked about hiring

do you have trouble firing people

no

i'm pretty sure almost every person

yeah

actually every person i've ever heard

we just give them severance

and i like to see it more as it's no

ill

well

like

if there's like

if i fired you

if is

there's some other job

you want me to help you get

i'll dm them on twitter

like you know

if you want to go work for

i don't know

insert whatever mtv give me someone to dm

i'll dm

like you know

i i try to make it more like a transition

and do whatever we can to make it as easy as something

was just not working for you because you want people like you said

super passionate

because at the end of the day

if you hold someone that you

uh

onto someone that you don't see

being here in 10 years

you're just doing a disservice

you're just giving them more ingrained more and rooted and where where they are

um

and the sooner you do it and help them move on to their like new life

the better

given all the wisdom you have now

if you were to give advice to somebody or if you were to start over again

uh

you had no money

what would be the first 10 videos you tried to

uh

to make on a new channel

i guess that's advice for a new person and nobody knows you

yeah

and nobody knows me

yeah

like

hypothetically

i have a mask on

and you also

i guess don't have the wisdom

well

if i don't have what i have in my head

then i would say

just fail like just a lot of people get analysis paralysis

and they'll just sit there and they'll plan their first video for three months

and yeah

i'm any of you listening

if

if you

especially

if you have zero videos on your channel

your first video is not going to give views

period

it's not your first ten are not gonna give views

i can very confidently say that

so stop sitting there

and thinking for months

and months on end and just get to work and start uploading like all you need to do this

this applies to people who have not uploaded videos but have dreams of being a youtuber is make 100 videos

and improve something every time do that

and then on your 101st video

we'll start talking like

maybe you can get some views

but you know your first hundred are gonna

there are very freak cases like liza koshy or emma chamberlain

who have really good personalities and it doesn't take them

so

as many videos

and it's just like people who are seven foot five and making an nba like

yes

there are free cases you can find

but for the average person like us

you know

who don't have these exceptional personalities and you know backgrounds in filmmaking

just make 100 videos improve something each time

and then talk to me on your 101st video

well

the improve something

his time is the tricky one

how do you improve something each time

the second one

just i don't know

put more effort into the script

the third one try to learn a new editing trick

the fourth one try to figure out a way that you can have better inflections in your voice

the fifth one try to you know

study a new thumbnail tip and implement it

the sixth one try to figure out a new title

there's infinite ways

that's the beauty of content creation online

there's literally infinite ways from the coloring to the frame rate to the editing to the filming

to the production

to the jokes

to the pacing

to every little thing can be improved and they can never not be improved

there's no

there's literally no such thing as a perfect video

so if you knew everything

you know now

but no money

step one

would i just brainstorm like okay

i don't have money

what are some viral things like

i mean

the first thing that comes to my mind is something as simple as

when i count to a hundred thousand

which is what i did do and i i was poor

um

and like that worked

but like

what's something like that

i could do

that would be even more attention

yeah

you were as part of the brainstorm you would throw out a lot of ideas

and people throw out a bunch of ideas

and one of the questions is

is this even doable

right

yeah

first off

come up with ideas you think would do well and then ask yourself later if they're doable

yeah

because there's

there's different ways you can accomplish something

don't be cynical about the doability of stuff

yeah

because there really are so many different ways you can accomplish a goal like um

when we give away an island

like we give our 100 million subscribers island

yeah

you know

you can't find private islands that you know

don't look like shit for less than 10 million dollars so this isn't doable

right

all right

the idea doesn't exist

not doable exit off

but then you know

you dig into it and you

you know

find different alternatives and you find okay

what if we just buy a two million dollar island that sucks and then spend a million dollars

you know

importing some sand

let's build a beach

let's import 300 trees

let's put a little bit of canals

cut

some pass boom

now it's a really nice island

but it's actually affordable

because we don't have 10 million dollars to spend on video

but we can afford to spend three and a half and lose whatever a million dollars on that video

so

like

that's an example of like

yeah

if you just went off the gut test

you're like this isn't doable

you know

every island is 10 million dollars

we're screwed

like

if we go cheaper

it's just a terrible island

no

and so if you like

there are so many different ways you can achieve what you want

you've really got to push through notes

which not a lot of people do you have to have

like a more of a dominant personality and just a willingness to

um

when people tell you it's not possible

just actually go through all the variables and eliminate them all yourself

have a stubbornness and

uh

resilience to failure

maybe for what we do and creators online

it's very imperative that you have that

a no

isn't a no deal that you really have to like think and um

and just like we

we take a personality test and like

just having a dominant personality is a better indicator that when someone tells you

oh

there's no way you're going to build a brick wall for under 100 grand

you know you'll be like okay

and then still go check the next 10 vendors and you know

figure it out

yeah

uh

what advice would you give to an already established channel

like with one

two

three

four million subscribers

how to like 10x

it

like

increase it

um

without losing

maybe

yeah

that's where it's very specific

like channel by channel

you can't give general advice

okay

yeah

because if i do

millions of creators are gonna see this and then they're gonna do it and i'm gonna fuck them over

you know

oh

i see

so let's say i had like two million subscribers on this podcast

yeah

like

how would you 10x that without sacrificing what it is

10x is

your stuff

does it matter

so we you've talked about with success

yeah

it's different for everyone like is 10xing your definition of success

no

well

then it's gonna

right off the bat

it's hard because if you don't give a shit about 10x thing

it's even harder for 10x

um

he does this because he likes helping people

that's one thing i found throughout this day

every time i talk data

it's so funny with him because it's like you know you could do this to get more views

and he'll just be like blank

i'll be like that

doesn't register anything

he's just like

doesn't care

which is

it's really

i'm really nervous about that

i'm really nervous about the numbers affecting

because it's so fun

oh yeah

it's so fun to focus on the numbers and i'm

i'm really worried about that

but at the same time

you should be cognizant of that

because you've created not just some of the most watched videos but some of the most amazing videos ever

so it's

there's a strong correlation

there

it's not like you're selling your soul to make a highly viewed video

it's actually

if you look at the metrics

it helps you understand what is compelling and not

and so i feel like i am

uh

i feel like there's some value to investigate what work when people tune on and when

not to be more data driven

even on podcasts

but i'm really afraid

on the flip side

i think part of the appeal is that you don't care about that kind of stuff

but there there could be stuff that doesn't have to do anything with that

it has to do with stylistic choices of lighting and cameras

or maybe with

uh

um

for example

topics

yeah

you know

like

even what you've asked me here is like different than what most people ask me

yeah

so it could be

i mean

and it'd be nice to understand that

but yeah

again

i'm worried about polluting at the end of the day

it's

it's

this is a true case of

it's your own intuition

like you know your viewers better than anyone else

it's whatever see

i'd like to push back on that

i really don't you do

who else

name one person who knows your viewers better than you

uh

somebody that looks at numbers of podcasts

no

you know your viewers

you know you're the only

how many episodes have you done

uh

350.

exactly

but i'm not paying it

you're the only one who's watched every second of all 350 of them

probably

that's just

that's just not no

you haven't

but the okay

well

because you did it

so you do know what's in all of them

sure

your content is you people

i'm telling you you do

and this is just one of those moments

where you're an intelligent guy and you just have to trust your like instincts like

just think what is the typical x viewer and what do they want

i don't think like that

my tip

but that's all you would have to do

and whatever your gut tells you

that would be the best guess

you don't know what the typical viewer is

though

i don't

i know

because to investigate that would be very

very difficult

and then you have to start looking at the numbers

you have to start to like

consider demographics

the only way i know that anybody even watches it is because i'll sometimes run into people

like when i run along the river and they'd be like

i love you

lex

it's like okay

well

that

that's

that's the data point and they're like cool people

but you know

i don't know any

like

i don't have any other

it's difficult man

it's difficult to know

it's difficult to know who listens to boxes

the difficult

do you have a sense of who's

i mean

like you're so huge that everybody watches

yeah

uh

but no

i still do

i would say

if you were to just put a gun to my head and you're

you're like

all right

we're gonna pick a random person that watched your last video and you have to like

roughly guess what they are

and if you're not close

we'll kill you

i would say

probably like a teenager that plays video games

like some

something like that would be probably the typical one

and then there are people that are

maybe a little bit younger

a lot of people are are older as well

but in a ramble random sample size

yeah

it's probably like i'm a male boy that plays video games like

that's the best way i would describing it

but i don't try to pertain to them

i just make whatever i think is interesting and good content

um

and this is what we were talking about before

even though

hypothetically 35 to 40 of my audience is

uh

women

which is

you know less than a majority

if we get 100 million views of video

that's still 30 to 40 million females that watch every video

which is probably the largest

uh

you know views per video for women on the whole platform

which you wouldn't think that

you know

uh

like

i can't think of a single other creator that gets more women to watch their videos than that

um

and so it's just anything

even like people above the age of 30

even if it's only like three or four percent

that's still three to four percent of 100 million views

there's a lot of people that age

so we we hit a large group of uh

of kind of every demographic

if that makes any sense

so what if we look at other

maybe more challenging kinds of channels or not

but if we look at educational

for example

like lectures

or if we look

yeah

educational

it could be short videos

like

how would you 10x that like

uh

something on robotics and biology

on science

on engineering

on all of that

that's more educational focused

we would honestly just have to pull the

because it's the same way

if you went to gordon ramsay

you said how would a new cook cook better

you know it's like

even then

that's not even specific

you have to go channel by channel

you really do

or i'm

i'm giving horrible advice

because if there was these

just school rules

everyone would do it

you know what i mean

like

if there's these magical little principles

how quickly when you look at a channel

can you kind of give advice

yeah

it's

it's like surface love at the start

and then the more

if we watch 10 videos

i feel like i'd have a good profile and i could tell you

in my opinion

you know one

especially once i look at the analytics and i get more ingrained in

like

okay

the typical viewers

this

they're from here

here's how they're feeling

you know

because there are people who make videos for rednecks and like the rednecks

taste of content is just so much different than obviously women watching makeup videos

which are so much different than you know

teenage boys watching a minecraft video

they're just all different

so the biggest thing you have to do is put

put your head

your head in the headspace of the viewer and see the content how they would

because if you just try to only give your taste

which is what a lot of people do and things from your perspective

it's very biased and it's just not going to work for everyone

and that's actually how you do more harm than good

which is something i'm very careful of

yeah

but at the same time just generating a lot of ideas

i think the first time

i've talked to you

was on clubhouse

actually

yeah

i mentioned something about robots and like almost immediately went to generating a bunch of ideas around audiobooks

uh

it's just 100 robots versus a hundred humans

yeah

how far can a robot throw a potato

i think your idea

like

i think the first idea was because you just said so many ideas

i never even thought of

but it's

it's

it shows the value of

uh

basically brainstorming with people that think differently

but at the end of the day

my ideas are probably

you know

might lean towards some people a little bit younger than your audience

like some of the stuff

yeah

but there's still the ideas

like

i think

the first one you said because we're talking about

uh

quadruped

like a robot dogs

you said to replace a biological dog with a robot dog and see if the owner notices something

you're just quickly brainstorming different ideas of like how this was years ago

i remember that

yeah

which is just i mean it's like

oh yeah

i never really thought about that kind of

so it's the basic

the tension between what does it take for a robot and our ai system to replace the biological systems

that we

the biological creatures that we that we love in our lives

yeah

and

but like that was like the um

the pace of idea generation was the thing that struck me today

and in general

it's like that's how you get at good videos

is you keep keep things

it's much easier to make a video around a good idea obviously than a bad one

you're just setting yourself up for success

okay

so that's for

uh

10x thing already popular

um

channel

what's the hardest number

you said

uh

the numbers that matters

click-through rate

average view duration and and

uh

surveys

what's the hardest number to

uh

optimize for probably surveys

you know

do you have any

do you have an insight into the surveys at all

no

not really

but if you just click on a bunch of random videos online

you'll eventually get a survey

what's this video

transformative

heartwarming

inspiring what people rate does make a difference

um

and it's like you can get people to click a video

you can get them to watch it

but you can't really fake whether or not they're satisfied

like they don't lie

the service

you know

um

you know

maybe one person here

they're my troll

but once you're aggregate enough

it's a pretty clear telltale of the video

so either you're making a great video

or you're not

what is it

uh

minimizing the non regrettability

yeah

i think elon tweeted

that's what he's trying to do on twitter

twitter

and that's interesting

that's

that's basically the survey metric

# Chapter 6

the service

you know

um

you know

maybe one person here

they're my troll

but once you're aggregate enough

it's a pretty clear telltale of the video

so either you're making a great video

or you're not

what is it

uh

minimizing the non regrettability

yeah

i think elon tweeted

that's what he's trying to do on twitter

twitter

and that's interesting

that's

that's basically the survey metric

how happy you are that you've been using the platform

yeah

you know

untreated

we want to limit the amount of regrettable minutes people spend on twitter

and

uh

the first thing i thought

it's like that's something youtube already has

a lot

like their whole survey system

when feedback loop

how tough is it to take on youtube

you think like um

for twitter

yeah for twitter for anybody else

um

i mean it's gonna be basically impossible

i mean youtube's not going anywhere

and i mean i don't know

i

don't

i don't think anyone's gonna do what youtube does better than them

uh

at least not in the next 10 years you asked on twitter

would you rather have 10 million dollars or 10 million subscribers on youtube

uh

what would your own answer be at various stages in your career

if

uh

if

if i had nothing

i would say 10 million dollars

so

because with 10 million dollars you can hire some people

and pump out content with like a million or two

get 10 million subscribers

and then keep the other 8 million

so that's if you believe in your ability to grow a channel

if you

uh

well

if you

yeah

if you don't believe in your ability to grow channel

then you shouldn't take the 10 million subscribers

because you're just gonna kill the channel

so the 10 million is definitely a better question would be

would you rather have a million dollars or 10 million subscribers

that's where it gets a little tricky

because now it's like

hmm

you know a million dollars

life-changing amount of money

uh

but you know

if you sim

i know what you're doing

you probably make a million dollars off a 10 million subscriber channel

but it is a little bit

a million dollars might not be enough to to build a strong team

because you don't know how to do it

so you might waste all that money

yeah

or they just keep it and retire

yeah

okay

that's true

yeah

because 10 million's just so high

it's like just never work again

who cares for the average human

that's so much money

it's interesting to me

also do the value of the subscriber versus the value of the dollar

um

i suppose how valuable is a subscriber for

uh

like

what percentage of the videos

like

how

active

are the subscribers and watching the video

um

for you

that's hard

i don't know

i was actually thinking more about the subscriber to dollar

like

if someone has 10 million subscribers

have they made 10 million dollars

i don't know why that that kind of popped in my head

it's an interesting thought

uh

do you ever

when you analyze

uh

videos

do you ever analyze videos like we've talked about offline of other videos across the youtube in general

just to understand

trying to understand social behavior

all your

not all

but a lot of questions are analytics based

yeah

yeah

it's so

because i love it

uh

i mean

it's just a giant social experiment

right like what people like to watch what people share

yeah

it's like a fascinating

so i hate that

so

like i said before

what percentage of your audience do you think care about this kind of stuff like this

deeply about youtube analytics

i think a large amount care about

uh

curiosity and exploration of interesting ideas

so in that sense

yeah

this would

this was fitted

i love it

this is funny

this isn't me like trying to like

i

i love you and i actually i love future magnus one and i

um

and even your hikaru one was really good

a bunch of other ones

but i think we're getting to the point now

where only analytics junkies would want to keep hearing more analytics talk

and the normie is probably like they've had their dose of youtube talk for the next three years

maybe i'm wrong

hey comment

if i'm wrong

i could be

i don't know your audience

see

this is where you would tell me

shut up

i know my audience

you dumbass

and i don't at all

i actually

i just follow the threat of curiosity

and i think there's just a lot of curious humans in the world and and to me it's like

so the question about analytics is the question of basically stepping away

stepping outside of yourself and thinking

why the hell do i like tick tock so much

why do i like twitter so much

why do i like youtube so much and getting

even if you're not a creator

getting an insight into that is really interesting

it's like what

uh

because

because all these platforms are fundamentally changing the nature of content

people are reading books less

they're probably going to be watching movies less and less

they're probably going to be watching netflix

less and less

do you ever think about the the sort of the darker side of youtube and um

with shadow banning and censorship and all that kind of topics

especially if you see it in other platforms like twitter

that

yeah

that

uh

elon

recently highlighted the shadow banning that was happening and in general

the censorship that was happening on those platforms

do you think about the role of centralized control

which information isn't or isn't made available through search and discovery

i'll be honest

i never really think about it

so

uh

you just you just try to make fun videos

that

yeah

more

i'm kind of more in my own lane

but it's not like that

i don't just specifically think about

i just like a lot of stuff in general

like i'm just kind of in my own lane

thinking about my own stuff

uh

but you know

now you asked

i'm curious

what are your thoughts on on youtube and that kind of stuff

well

i'm generally against centralized

um censorship or shadow banning

shadow banning is the worst one

because not that the goal of creating a healthy platform where you're having great conversations

and

uh

videos that are not spreading misinformation

that sounds like an admirable goal

but that's too difficult of a job for a centralized entity

that's too big of a yeah

and then there's the mis information stuff

and then there's also

just like the videos where they do something that causes

uh

what what happened back in the the

where

uh

adpocalypse

you know

and a lot of creators

revenue plummets because people are are doing videos that advertisers don't deem acceptable

and then now all these big advertisers are pulling and the little guys are getting hit

and

because adverage drop

by 30 and the person who just quit his job to go full-time consecration now can't sustain it

so it's also

it's like a lot of different variables as well

that makes it so complicated

well

i think the big thing is transparency

especially around shadow banning for for people i agree on shadow banning

uh

you should be transparent

you should let people know it

it

you know

obviously there has to be some type of controls

people can't just post whatever

and so if you're pulling those levers

they should at least know

yeah

so they know how

uh

how to improve their content

they can understand it

they can

exactly

uh

if it's a wrong shadow

banning

like

it's a society that we should not shadow ban this kind of content

that means exactly

you should be publicly discussing it

because if not

and if it's not known

then it's just kind of like

well

then who's pulling the strings and like how

do we know they're not just manipulating things to get whatever message they want out there

and silence other ones

yeah

and there could be sort of in the background government influence

which is

where actual freedom of speech comes into play that the government should not have any control

or be able to put pressure on censorship of speech

and it gets weird if none of that is being

there's no transparency around it

yeah

let's see

but to be fair

that's a huge responsibility

the amount of content that youtube is uploaded on youtube

that is shared by youtube

viewed by you

but even more of a reason why it

it would probably makes sense to be transparent

yeah because then people can help fact check it

that's right

but that that requires building a platform that makes that easy right

like uh to

to make fact checking easy to make the like

twitter now has like being able to share context and all that kind of stuff that crowdsource

it

crowdsources

the way wikipedia crowdsource it

i mean there's

it's right

and then you open a random wikipedia article

but like you know

people criticize wikipedia because there is a political lean to the editors of wikipedia

and then they get

there's some articles that definitely have a bias to them

and all that kind of stuff

it's a difficult problem

it's a difficult problem to solve that

ultimately

as much as possible

it would be nice for the viewer to have control of that versus the the entity that's hosting it

so for the viewer to decide

yeah

i'm just going to make fun cool videos

yeah

yeah

you know

let's go to antarctica again

how was that

how was going to you just came back from antarctica

that was

i watched the video

that was

that was fun

that was a really fun video

thank you

um

there's

i mean there's a lot of things i can comment about that

but what was that

what was the hardest part of making that video the hardest part was just getting out there

it's just so remote

and you know you land the plane on just this ice runway

and it's so sketchy and then once the plane takes off

you're just there and you're the most remote place in the planet

and it's

it's just

it's very breathtaking

i don't

if you have the chance to ever go to antarctica

i would recommend it

it was probably like the in the video

we climbed a mountain

um

that wasn't named

so we can name it

and like standing on top of that mountain and just seeing kindling nothing

and because

once you get outside the outskirts and you get deep in antarctica

there's no penguins

nothing lives there at all

um

and so there's just nothing in every direction

it's just snow and these crazy beautiful mountains and some of them sticking to the clouds

and it was in the um

if you go during summer time

the sun never goes down

so the sun's up

24

7

and it's just like spinning in circles at the top of the planet or whatever

it looks like the top

um

yeah

you guys come with it several times

how beautiful

yes

and so it's just

yeah

it's just very beautiful

what about shooting itself like the technical aspects of shooting it

oh

i mean

well

so somehow we lucked out

one of the days

it was like the warmest day in like forever

that's been in antarctica

it's like it was positive

uh

degrees

but at certain parts

there's also like negative 20

negative 30

and that's where the cameras

you constantly have to be switching out the batteries

and heating them up and like putting them basically in like your pants

or they'll just get way too cold

and

uh

we were prepared for much worse

but it ended up being much better than we thought so for that video

but in general

maybe some other challenging videos

how does how do you go from the idea stage to the actual execution to the final video

what's can you take me through

like a full process of

like

we're talking about some crazy wild ideas today

how do you go from that to a final video where you click publish

well

i mean obviously

first things

first

you gotta figure out the idea and then it just depends

i mean pick any video you can think of on my channel

i can take you through it

uh

uh

well

what about the

in a circle you have to stay in a circle for uh

400 days

yeah

so for that one step

one

one of the most popular

yeah

that video did really well

yeah

so we

um

problem is

uh

we have to

this is where you get really into the nuances of the company

because we have a lot of videos going out

you can't just in a vacuum be like

all right

we're not doing anything for 100 days

we're only filming this

so step one is we had to build an independent crew that could actually do that for 100 days

that way everyone else could keep working on the normal videos and not just screw everything up

yeah

um

so

step one

you build that team

okay

we got the team

now

what do we need

well to do this

we need probably like 10 cameras

at least rolling at all times

so

uh

we're probably gonna need to get a trailer and hook up a bunch of storage and stuff

so to just carry the sheer volume of footage we're gonna have and so get a trailer set up

the cameras go on the field

paint a circle

now we need a house

go buy a house

bring it out there

uh

and then it's like

oh wait

i think it'd be funny if i brought the house in on the intro for

yeah

you know

find a crane that can lift up a house so i can drive it in

and drop it in the intro

and that's like an iterative process where you're like

okay

this would be funnier

so this is not all up front

yeah

it's like your

ideally

it would be

but as you kind of see things

you get inspired and then you think of more and more

uh

and then this would be better with a crane

yeah

it'd be better if i dropped out of the house

yeah

that was crazy that you decided to do that

uh

so fearless in the kind of crazy stuff

you're willing to do

exactly what i'm a broken record

but whatever makes the best video possible

yeah

that's

that's all you

you focus on

okay

so

uh

what about the delegation of like

who

gets to what are the cameraman

like the people operating the cameras

what

uh

who's responsible for different things

this is like a distributed process like

well

that's where whoever the lead cam would be on that video would just decided that one

because we shot over 100 days

we didn't a lot of it was just sean and the guy who was in the circle just vlogging

i'm just gave him a camera

yeah

and he figured it out

and then we'd have like for him

just set hours each day that i can't remember would come

so if he had any content

he needed extra hands instead of just having someone on standby 24

7. it made more sense to do set hours nice

um

and uh

yeah

it was

it was hard

but you know it's funny and hindsight

it sounds so simple

you know

and i i guess

like the more

because that one is relatively simple

i guess

because it's a low number of people

yeah

the hard part about that is just the time right

like you know

i checked in on them so many different days

and it's like an hour here

two hours or two hours there

over a hundred days adds up to be a ton of time

and

and even then

like you know

if you have a 10 person crew

you know paying them daily rates for 100 days

it just all that adds up

what about

like the 100 versus 100

100

uh

adults versus the other kids

was

uh

bringing that to life

that seems like exceptionally challenging

yeah

basically the thought process was we did 100 kids or sorry

100 boys

100 girls

yeah

people loved it

honestly

i didn't think they'd like it as much as they did

video did really really well

so the second i saw that video was crushing

i was like all right

we're doing it again

but last time we did it

we did in our studio

so we built a

a giant room

put 100 girls in

it sounds bad

when i explain it like this

and then a gyrant put 100 boys

yeah

and we're like after 100 hours

which everyone has the most people give them half a million dollars

so did well

so we're like

all right

we're gonna do it again

so we threw out all these different ideas

it was like 100 football players versus 100 cheerleaders

100 this 100 that

and

uh

100 prisoners versus 100 cops

just craziest ideas

and we settled on 100 kids versus 100 adults

um

and then the next step was like

how do we make it better

the kids versus adults are the sorry

the boys versus girls

the first one we did was inside and the problem was every time it was night

when we did these long time lapses

you couldn't see the sun go up and down

so we're like

okay

this time

i want to do it outside

that's why the cubes are outside

um

and instead of doing circles

we want to make them cubes

and then you know

as figuring out

do we want that

yeah

there's just those videos came up at least today as ones that are like

really complicated in terms of the audio

in terms of how

yeah

film

it

yeah

that's the problem

we had a lot of audio issues because

uh

in the first one we didn't have a roof on it

the second one

there was a roof

so there's a lot of reverb

which then

in editing made it brutal

like half the shots weren't usable

and it really screwed us over

so we had to do a lot of frankensteining in the editing to make up for basically my ignorance

so you mentioned that you were surprised

how well that that one did

a lot of creators talk about getting depressed when

um

the videos don't do as well as they kind of expect it

there's the kind of feeling you can get really worn out by that dude

yeah

um

you do your yourself feel that and also do you have advice

for others that feel this

um

yeah

it's weird because i am a numbers guy

but also it

it used to

it used to

very much

especially when i was like betting everything i had on a video

when it did bad

i was devastating

i'd cry and i'd be depressed for days and it really would have a severe impact on my mood

but i don't know

now

it doesn't really matter

it's uh

if a video that's bad

i just look at it and i'm like

oh

why'd this video do bad

uh

probably

oh

there's a little retention dip there

i don't think people like the thumbnail

# Chapter 7

it used to

it used to

very much

especially when i was like betting everything i had on a video

when it did bad

i was devastating

i'd cry and i'd be depressed for days and it really would have a severe impact on my mood

but i don't know

now

it doesn't really matter

it's uh

if a video that's bad

i just look at it and i'm like

oh

why'd this video do bad

uh

probably

oh

there's a little retention dip there

i don't think people like the thumbnail

maybe we should switch it

i just look at it

objectively unemotional

and then just move on and i feel like that's a much healthier way of going about it

so if a creator is listening like that is the ideal way to um

respond to a video that's doing bad

just remove emotion from the equation

and just look at it and figure out how you can search the next one

is there tricks to detect

being able to detach yourself from the from that

because

because i

in your case

i mean that's true for creators

but in your case

there's like a lot of money on the

line

yeah

well

there's videos

yeah

so much time

but no

i mean you

just

i mean

i don't know

the only real answer is

it's just the conscious effort

you just have to unemotionally look at the video

determine the problems and then move on like there's there is no secret

you know what i mean

it's just that's

it's that

and if you really can't bring yourself to do it

then you're just screwed

honestly

maybe you're not meant for this game

okay

so that's part of the development as the creator is like being able to be a different longevity

yes

yeah

you have to unemotionally be able to look at videos that flop and figure it out

uh

because

if not just getting you can

not every video can be a one out of ten

and so when a video does bad

you know that that just stress and depression

it's just gonna eventually get to you in the long run

so you said you've uh

failed in a bunch of videos

uh

sort of taking them to completion

so what are some of the biggest fails

yeah

weirdly

enough

as we've matured and we've done this more

we don't have that problem as much

especially that we're getting into the multi-million dollar budgets per video

it's like failure is not really an option anymore

so i'm a little more particular about what i do

but back in the day

yeah

like we would do a video where we spent 24 hours on a desert island

and

uh

we filmed

it did it all

and i just i didn't like it after the edit

so i just grabbed the voice

and we went back to the deserted island and spent another 24 hours there and refilmed it

um

or

uh

could that have been caught and prevented at the idea stage

like where

like

no

it's a good idea

it was just poor execution to be honest

when we were out there

it was hot

we were

we're just like we all

at one point just kind of wanted to die

it was just miserable

so how do we

how do you avoid that these days

uh

well

i just thought it was a little cooler to be honest

and then we had literally the amount of fun we had in the video was like 10 times higher

oh interesting

so you like

there's some practical details that you just learned

yeah

i don't know what it takes

videos that where it's very hot or or it's on water

because i get super seasick

it's like a kind of like 10 things that

if they have these variables

i'm down to do it

but my fun meter is not as high as normal

uh

like we tried to sp

um

anytime we do anything on a boat

like when we spent 24 hours of beer in a triangle or when i tried to spend

like

which i didn't get up

but i try to spend like 100 hours at sea or whatever

just like on a raft

it's just like i

it makes me want to throw up and i get so seasick

i can't even see straight

but there are just some videos that require me to be on a boat

so i just suck it up

um

so

when you spend months in creating a video

i know this is probably stressful to some creators

uh

like

how much stress

how do you feel when you have to click

publish

uh

video

no

not much you're able to detach yourself

yeah

again

in old me tons

i mean i'd be like scratching and nervous and like my hands would be sweating like to the point

where i'm almost about to puke

i'm like

i really hope people like this

but you know

i don't know

i think that's just part of maturing it

there's different

and as a content creator

there's different phases

and

uh

you just like

once you get over the

the fear that you're just gonna wake up one day and be irrelevant

you know

and you

just

you know

accept that

like you believe in yourself and you believe in your content and that you can continue to be relevant

then you don't

i don't know

you

kind of

it's a little bit easier to attach yourself

i guess

and that's i

it's a much healthier place to be

you can't do this for 10 years

if every little thing just causes these huge emotional reactions

it's like

that's why a lot of creators go a little

you know

mentally

insane you know you have to get out of that that game

right

because it really messes with you

we've talked about this a little bit

but how do you define

and how do you suggest others define success

some people success is retiring

their mom is inspiring people and educating them

and you know

whatever they're peaking

their curiosity

um

for other people

it's just quitting their job

so you have to self-reflect on what your definition of success is

because i think a lot of creators kind of don't really think

don't introspect like they kind of want to keep getting more and more subscribers

kind of thing

and yeah

but subscribers is just a vanity metric

you know

it doesn't

subscribers don't correlate to views sure or views what

yeah

i know

but that's more

that was a drag to you

that was more direct to people listening

because

uh

a lot of people do really care about subscribers or even followers

like on tick tock

but if you look like your view

if on youtube

very

very

few

percent

if even a percent of your views come from the sub feed

right

you know

they're almost all home features

suggested

what's the last time you clicked on your sub feed to watch a video

oh almost never

yeah

yeah

maybe five years ago it used to be a thing

it's not anymore

no one does

um

and it's getting harder and harder to find

i subscribe to way too many channels

i think

yeah

that's what everyone does and you subscribe to 10 channels

they're great

but two years later your taste evolves and it's like it's a mess and so um

subscribers don't really matter

followers on tick tock don't really matter

um

so anyways

it

really

they really are the definition of a vanity metric

and but what about views they do

obviously

because if people are showing up time and time again

that's what matters

okay

so that that's a good thing to

uh

define a success

i just feel like

um

that too can be a problem

because

uh

i would say

you know

if i wanted to be successful

like it's a young creator

i might start copying mr beast or something like that

right

yeah

like

there's

you start trying to take shortcuts as opposed to find your your own unique voice

right

so

like chasing views is a problem too

it feels like or no

um

it's as long as you detach yourself from them

i mean if you're lazy

yeah

and you just want to copy someone else and not experiment and find your own way but yeah

i mean you can't make that excuse for them

and someone just isn't coming up with original stuff and putting in the effort

you can't just say

oh

it's because they're chasing views

we need some different metric from the chase

no

they just need to find their own way

well

it just feels like unique type of content will often lead to sacrifice in the number of views in the short term

by the long term

you win

okay

or if you do win you

you win more

i guess would be a better way putting it

do you think you will ipo

miss mr beast burger or feastables in the next five

ten years beast burger or feasible snow

i

i kind of think they're something actually

you know what

i just realized that this is our first time talking about those

we're like an hour and a half in

that's so funny

we started talking about what

uh

my retention brain kicked in

um

i wonder if you have retention brain for

like life itself

i do every time i'm talking to someone i can

i'm like

okay

what about

like loved ones

like spending time with loved ones thinking like we could be doing something much better right now

yes

no

that is a serious problem

uh

with

well

so we'll pause the b square

question

yes

but that's why

uh

my current girlfriend

uh

which i was telling you before when we were talking about this is

she has a genuine love for learning

and that's something i have

like

i always feel like i need to be learning something to justify the time i'm spending

and so that's why it's such a nice trait

because i feel like that time is being used optimally

because whether we're watching a documentary or we're going in in

you know

taking an iq tests or reading about

whatever

just why modern art is the thing

i don't know

whatever weird thing we decided to do

i'm always learning and improving

so it justifies the time

so

to maximize retention in your relationship

yeah

you want to spend time with that time learning as much as possible

yeah

which conveniently i don't have to force right or i want to be recharging

so i

when i do work

i can

you know

hit the ground harder

and luckily we're into a lot of the same things which you know happen to be learning

sometimes it's not learning

like maybe watching an anime or something like that

um

but i'm a big believer and you're either

if you

well

if you

if your goal is to be like a super successful entrepreneur

you need to either be working or you need to be doing something that decompresses and recharges you

so you can work again

if your goal is to be like a really kick-ass entrepreneur

obviously we're boiling this down to like a very basic thing

and so the the things you're doing

your down time when you're not working

if it doesn't recharge

you

you're screwed

you're just a ticking time

but i'm waiting to implode

um

and so you gotta like heavily recharge and like

so like watching for me

anime or whatever it is

playing a board game

like that is actually kind of crucial to my success

which takes a lot of maturing to come to that conclusion

because i used to be the kind of guy that wanted to work every hour of the day

and i would try to train myself to not need that stuff

and i

you know

and i almost resented like that

i i have to do these kinds of things and it would piss me off because it's not optimal

and you know

i just really want to make content and entertain people

but yeah

as someone who's gone down that road

and you know

you just work every day for two

three months straight

and you know every hour of the day

and then you just a bomb waiting to explode and lose your mind

and the only real sustainable thing is to just like

give yourself time to recharge in between working

so there's a kind of balance you have to find

you have to even

and i hate it more than anyone else

because i

you know

you hate not working

yes

because it's just not optimal for time like it's

it's

it's

as a human

i do need to occasionally watch a mindless show and play a board game

yeah

and it took me a very long time to like

come to peace with that and not

i would have like borderline panic

attacks when i do it

because i just

what am i doing right now

why am i doing this

i should be

you know

like what if

one day i have to lay off an employee because we're not doing so well

like

how could i justify watching this this show or whatever i'm doing right now

you know

it's like there's a lot of things like

that that go on in your head but it's necessary before we return to

uh

mr beast burger

what is like

is this one on the topic

what is a perfect day in the life

perfectly productive day in the life of mr beast look like

oh boy

well

i mean or like a stand

i mean the perfectly productive day as we filmed my main channel video

because those get 100 million a pop

i mean it doesn't really get any better than that

what about

like the average day when you're not on the set

yeah

and you're like

because you're running a lot of things

right

yeah

so right now we have our snack brand feastables

we have a restaurant chain piece burger and then we

basically

which

we haven't even really launched any products yet

but we have the the data company that i was showing you

where we're gonna roll out some tools for creators

and then we have the reacts channel

the gaming channel

the main channel

and then we have my charity

which also has a channel

um

and so kind of how i've structured my life right now

uh

is

whatever

i have free time

we just kind of go

hey

guys

jimmy's got an hour from 2pm to 3 p. m

and it's everyone's just like i need this

i need this and this channel's like

i need this thing filmed

or you know

whatever

the guy who runs my tick tocks like i need this tick tock filmder

um

you know

beast burger is

like

i need this menu item approved

do we need to talk about this marketing thing

and then we kind of just look at what everyone needs and we're like that

one looks like the most important we'll do that

and then

so it's just kind of like

you know

if i just did that for every company in a day

then that's optimal

if i just kind of like an optimal day for me

would be going down the eight companies and just whatever they're like

two to three biggest pain points or things to need from me

and just doing those based on priority and then trying to keep it as short as possible

yeah

to just the things that you're needed on

it doesn't get more optimal than that

if i clear the bottlenecks or some bottlenecks for all my companies

then it's yes

that's a perfect day

yeah

i mean even just me

because you're like you're showing me around and you're being a great and gracious host

but on top of that

you're just doing all these meetings

you

you

basically

i felt bad at some points

i was like

oh

i just tricked him into going to meetings with me

he's like my little meeting buddy

yeah

i mean it was

it was fun

it's fun to see it

it was fun to see how effectively you've delegated

you basically trust the team to do a really good job on the various things

and there's just a strong team that's able to carry the five on all the different tasks

yeah

from the

from the brainstorming and the main channel to the reacts

and so on

yeah

it's really interesting

i mean it's

it's really interesting what it takes to build a team like that

because you very quickly build the very large team

that's that's able to scale

which is very scary

because it's my first

you know

i i'm 24. you know

and i think i was telling you this earlier it's funny

because six years ago i had to raise my hand to go use the bathroom

and now i'm in charge of hundreds of people and entertain hundreds of millions of people

and so it is crazy

just how quick it comes up

and i wish i was a little bit older

so i could have ran a couple companies

and failed a few companies in the past and like learn from those and apply those here

because i know for a fact when i'm 34

i'm 24 now when i'm 34.

i'll

i'll know so much more about running a business

and scaling and hiring and and how to lead people and

better

effectively communicate

and all these different skill sets that will make them a better leader that

uh

that's the only thing that sucks is

uh

i just don't have those

because i just haven't been through the lessons

and i just have such a lucrative thing on my plate right now

and it just sucks that i have to learn the lessons with the lucrative thing

you know what i mean

yeah

because you

you already have so much influence

so much impact

but you have effectively scaled

what

what lessons do you draw from that

how to effectively scale as a 24 year old

like

yeah

that's something i feel like i actually could give a lot of value to to young people who are doing it

like older people who've built five companies or whatever they do

um

i probably couldn't

you know they're gonna be like

oh

this is so obvious

but

um

for uh

younger first-time business owners

you kind of just experiment to be honest

and

uh

but for us like

it's just a new space

no one had really ever skilled up a 100 person team to build make content on youtube

so there wasn't no

uh

i spent all this time

like i hired one person from disney to at one point to come in and help

and obviously that was a dumb idea

looking back on it but you know i thought

oh

they make great stuff

people want to watch

and they come over here and help me build a team

and you know they build it more the traditional way and not like how it should be online

and and so then it's like okay

and now i'm not trying to trash people

like they all tried their best

but then i try hire this one person who does this different type of uh media

and runs a 100 person team

and then you come in here and they try to build it that way

they don't really listen to you or value or or see the difference

and i i tried basically for building this company with like four

or five different people who worked in different veins of media

and you know every single time it

just like they just don't get it and they like they don't understand my world

and the

the eventual solution was just like throw up my sleeves and do it myself

you know

with

like james

where i hit man and just like no no one's ever done this

and like no one's gonna just give us a golden carrot and tell us how to build this company

# Chapter 8

and they come over here and help me build a team

and you know they build it more the traditional way and not like how it should be online

and and so then it's like okay

and now i'm not trying to trash people

like they all tried their best

but then i try hire this one person who does this different type of uh media

and runs a 100 person team

and then you come in here and they try to build it that way

they don't really listen to you or value or or see the difference

and i i tried basically for building this company with like four

or five different people who worked in different veins of media

and you know every single time it

just like they just don't get it and they like they don't understand my world

and the

the eventual solution was just like throw up my sleeves and do it myself

you know

with

like james

where i hit man and just like no no one's ever done this

and like no one's gonna just give us a golden carrot and tell us how to build this company

we got to figure the fuck out ourselves and you have to kind of build up people from scratch

then

yeah

exactly all the stuff i was talking about earlier and all the the lessons i learned along the way

um

and sophie

for me

that was a big part of like

and try to stop trying to have someone build this company for me and just do it myself

because it's scary like my whole life studying youtube videos of virality

not business building

but fuck i was like

i guess we just got to do it ourselves

and

um

and that's where things really start to click and we got the exponential growth

we started getting the right people and training them the right way

and you know

just throwing conventional stuff out the door and focusing on what's actually practical for youtube

which is just completely different than traditional media

so you train people and then those people train people and and so on

yeah

i mean it's just even like

you know how you do the lighting on sets or like

how you do the audio or

or

um

you know

not writing scripts

so you know

we're just not as efficient with our filming

like sometimes i have to have 30 cameras running

why

because it's not scripted

i don't

i don't know what chris is gonna do when we start filming

he might run over there

but guess what we got to have it planned

because there's only one shot

i can't

you know

tell them not to do that

yeah

that's the shooting

but then there's also the editing

yeah

and then the editing as well

and not having guardrails

and kind of

you know

i

at the end of the day

it's whatever i want the video

their job is to make a video that they think i'll like

because it's my channel

but you know you can achieve that kind of

however

and um

and so it's just everything's just different

you know it's much more

i guess

like a startup as opposed to um

are you often surprised like with the result

like you think

a certain

like

we watched the video today

that was really nice

those different than you would have potentially edited

yeah

are you sometimes surprised by

like a decision editor makes

it's like okay

that's not the way i would have done it

but it's actually this is a cool idea

yeah

of course

yeah

now

um

the thing my biggest fear is i don't ever want to get trapped in like a bubble of

you know

because we are getting 100 million views of video on the main channel

like

but i don't want to get in this feedback loop of just my ideas are great

or or not feedback loop

but stop learning and improving

because it is easy sometimes to be like what we're doing is working

we need to just keep doing it

i want to keep learning and trying new things

and i guess one way i'd put is like you don't when

when you're on a a come up or you're growing

you don't want to

uh

test new things once

uh

you start to plateau or have a downtrend

because if you're like

you know you

you're skyrocketing

right

you're up up and then you level off

you start to go down and you're like

oh

this isn't working anymore

let's start experimenting

well

if you have a bad experiment now you're in like a tailspin

you're nose diving and you have one more bad experiment

you're like screwed

kind of i'm oversimplify

you want to test things while you're still growing to keep the growing from happening

because once you like

have you know again

very oversimplifying that

like you know

kind of level off

you do a couple tests that go wrong

am i

you're like screwed

you know you're already out the door

now you're just confirming that you're out the door

an online entertainment

so that's kind of how i see it

so i think it's very imperative that you're constantly always experimenting and trying things

even if you're getting crazy

unheard of growth

and so that

outside of the thing that brought you to the dance

you just dived right into

uh

mr beast burger and feastables

this is a whole nother industry

like

what was that like

well

so beast burger

we kind of it was supposed to be like just a pop-up like we just partnered with someone who had 300 restaurants

and we're just like you know

um

let's let's just

uh

sell beast burgers for a day or two

let's let's see what happens

we didn't really think it would be as big as it was

but those first like that first day

you know

we do six figures in sales and they all sell out and they're running to local walmarts

they can't keep up with the demand

and it's like okay

well

maybe let's just leave it open a week

whatever

um

and we're just doing crazy revenue and it's like okay

well

let's add some more restaurants

and let's just leave them open for a month and we're just still doing six figures a day

and it kind of just went from this thing that was

i don't know it wasn't really

i don't really plan on running a restaurant chain

but here i am

but didn't that in some sense also open your mind to something like festivals

feasible

is something i've always wanted to do

because i i think

just in general

uh

american snacks are just full of so much horrible ingredients

to be honest

and they're not

i don't know

i feel like there also just hasn't been any innovation in american snacks in quite a while

um

and so that's just something i've always been pretty passionate about

the thing

we built that from scratch

so we hired the ceo and built a team around them

and we

we spent probably over two and a half years before we even launched

just like building the right team

figuring things out and making sure it was actually ran the way i wanted

um

which feasible has just been crushing

it's

it's very interesting

uh

this is something i've never talked about publicly

but having products in retail

it's like before feastables

everything i had done was online

so if you wanted to

you know anything from the cocoa peace brand

you'd have to buy it online and ship it to you

but feastfuls

now that you know

because our first product

chocolate bars

we started putting that in retail locations

so

like

for example

walmart

it's

it's crazy

like

it's just

it doesn't make sense

how if you're which

i guess it does for

because we get 100 million views of videos

so a lot of people know us

if i go stand in walmart

those people recognize me and ask for photos

like if i still don't enough

i could take 150 photos today in walmart 200

whatever it is

so obviously it makes sense those people go find feastfuls

but then you just multiply that by every walmart in america

and it just gets so crazy

and i didn't think we'd be doing the kind of revenue we are

and we're about to launch in some other

i don't know if i'm allowed to say so whatever

but other big retail

you know

locations and convenience stores

and like

by the end of next year we could be in like 40

fifty thousand locations

and the numbers just don't make sense

so you know

what are some interesting challenges about scaling there

that surprised you

the biggest problem

which i didn't think would be was just keeping the shelves and walmart stock

to be honest

like it would have to supply

it was supply chain

it was brutal

well

even then

sometimes

like you know

you get them the stuff

and they're like

it takes them like a day or two to put it out in that specific location

and i i had to stop promoting it

because every time i'd mention it

like 40 of people would just be like it's not there

it's not in walmart or i can't buy it

and so there's like a three ish month period where i just didn't promote festivals

because i was scared that someone would go by

and this is not there

and so like

it took us a very long time to catch up to the demand

and also

it's not like we have unlimited money

so but now we're relatively caught up in um

keeping up

but it's gonna be interesting

because now this year in 2023

we're gonna

basically

you know

10x the amount of locations they're in

so

or

and we're gonna try to launch new products

so we're in for an interesting ride

but yeah

i just hate

i hate when i tell people you know like

hey

go try this product and then they go in their local walmart and eventually other places

and it's not there

it's just so brutal

you know they made that whole journey out there and they didn't get it

and so that that was

really it

um

besides that

no

it's

it's been doing way better than i ever thought

uh

you've talked to a couple places about maybe doing mobile games or computer games in the future

yeah

yeah

is that something you're still considering

yes

um

because

uh

you know

do you normally talk with people as much as we talked beforehand

is that

no

no

that that was the pro who spent all day today

look in my head

everything you asked me is stuff we already talked about

not really well

no

no

not everything

i take it back

but sorry

the last two questions

yes

and so it's just funny

because what

no

i tried it's okay

there's a different style of asking those questions because i

i

on purpose

didn't dig further with you

uh

i could tell

yeah

so i can tell you

okay

this is

by the way

okay

all right

well

this is the first time i've ever talked to somebody as much as i did with you beforehand

yeah

well

on the same day

i know we're not even saying okay

together

one hour

yeah

literally

it's funny

um

this is a hilarious and awesome social experiment

i think i picked this hotel and i just like harassed him all day to hang out with me

and then

great

here we are

now

i love it

um

i was secretly recording the whole time

just

you know

i'm just kidding

anyway

so what was the question

yeah

so the interesting thing is

uh

with beast burger and feastables that

um

there's physical goods

as opposed to like making mobile games or pc game

whichever one we end up doing

which is software

and i actually have a giant international audience

like

um

most of my audience is obviously outside of america

and so the problem we're running into is it just takes time to build up the supply chain

and get feastables in southeast asia

get festivals in india

get festivals in brazil and mexico and all these other places

where we have giant pockets of our audience and same thing with peaceful

it's just it's going to take probably years

uh

unless we partner with someone who already has the distribution

which we're figuring out

but the udf software is

i can make a hypothetical game or whatever we end up doing

and all my fans

can you know

use it tomorrow the day i mentioned it

and so if i promote something in a video to 100 million people and it's like

uh

you know

basically like a game

they can all download it

so there you know

um

but if i promote a feast rules bar right now

it's only in america because we're struggling just to keep up with american demand

we haven't even gotten the chance to go outside america

so i i alienate

i'm uh

a majority of my audience

and it feels so shitty to just from

you know

mention something that most of them can't buy

but on the flip side you can't just spawn this crazy infrastructure

and just have tens of millions of bars

and all your products in every single store across the world before you promote it

so you can't put the egg before the chicken

and so

um

it's like that

that's

that's what i'm excited about

i want to get into less physical stuff and more stuff that everyone matters can actually use

this is the thought process

especially if there's a social element to the gaming too

because it's not unlike feastables

like that's a product you consume

you missed it

when you're setting it for this

we were

uh

doing some

basically just laying out every everything that we're planning for

so our interfaces where we want to start hiring the team to build it

and we're kind of just laying out the game

and i was actually really curious to get your thoughts

but i can't say it

because whatever i say

someone's just gonna take it and run with it

but you're pretty good idea about the kind of games you're thinking about

yeah

i mean i can imagine we also talked a little bit about it

it's super awesome

good one

i did so much good talk

all right

the juicy talks having you

she's like

i gotta go set up

well

you know i

i already heard a lot awesome

i mean

but that is a different kind of team you would need to hire

yeah

is that a little

uh

nerve-wracking like going into a new field and trying to a little bit

but then i remind myself like

like steve jobs didn't know how to code right

and you know he just he just knew what a good product was

and i feel like as someone who wasted so much of his lives playing video games

i have a good sense of it

and that might be ignorance

well

that's really important

right

it's not about coding

it's about what makes for a good game

exactly

and again

that might genuinely be ignorant

so maybe i end up

you know

getting bit in the butt because of what i'm saying now

but i think

just like with youtube

i just want to obsess over making a great product and things that i think my audience will love

and i think

as long as i keep that as my north star will do

well

uh

what is the path to being worth 100 billion look like

doesn't have to be worth 100 billion look like

i don't know

because okay

okay

let me just like

pause here

24 and there's so much awesome scaling so many great ideas

you

you think about different trajectories

yeah

uh

what those possible trajectives might look like

yeah

i mean if the goal was to just be worth 100 billion dollars

yes

i'm my goal of a broken record

so make the best view impossible

because i know whatever else i want will come

obviously

the video is the foundation

yeah

exactly so to pat to 100 billion dollars just keep getting 100 million views of video

you know what i mean

um

but or more

oh yeah

or more

exactly if we can keep growing

but you know

if we can keep feasibles

growing right

and we eventually spend international

and one day we're in 100 000 retail locations

and we're selling the same amount of excuse or units per skews

like we're currently doing

uh

i mean that would crush

and then

obviously

ideally

one day we open up hundreds of beast burgers

we get it where we turn out

you know

like supercell

a couple hit games

i don't want to make dozens or hundreds of games

i just want to make games that are just great

and you know

we rarely drop them while we do

they're bangers

um

and just

you know

whatever other stuff

we end up doing all that combined

i mean it's just interesting

because like what

what's a show that's pulled 100 million views per episode

basically

that's like we're doing like

you know

i mean

like the super bowl gets praised because they get 100 million viewers

but i can't think of a show

um

maybe in reruns or something

so there's also a show that's has

uh

has a singular kind of figure

yeah

that you can now use as a

like

i don't have a network tell me what to do

i don't have anyone like

i can do whatever i want

so it's a very interesting position

because i put out content and 100 million people show up and then i also have a gaming channel

i put out content

15 million people show up in a reaction

i put out content

10 million people show up and have a tick tock and i put out content and on average

20 million people show up and like

and i

so

as long as i can keep that going

and then we build these businesses

it's like

it's honestly pretty scary to see what will happen

you know

uh

over the years

because feastables launched

you know

last year 2022

so it's a relatively new thing and beast burger

we just started scaling up the physical side and we haven't obviously even launched any mobile games yet

so i think i'm at the antithesis of it

i don't see a world where my youtube channels are relevant in the next couple of years

i just this is what i live for

and so if i can keep that going

and then really start to expand these businesses that leverage off of it

then

yeah

i mean

hopefully there's the day one where i could give away a billion dollars in a video

honestly

that that

yeah

that would be one hell of a video

um

let me ask you the ridiculous question

since you went from being broke to being

uh

rich

although you keep

uh

spending all your money

um

but

uh

does money buy happiness

how has money changed

sort of your

your happiness in life

it's money by happiness

um

no

not

i mean to a point

yes

once you can take care of your health

you can take care of

like any immediate dangers and you can take care of your family

relatively

no

it doesn't like

but those things do like

when i first came into money

one of the first things i did was retire my mom and like that brought me tons of happiness

you know what i mean

and like

you know

if my brother had a medical emergency and and we couldn't afford it

and i made money to afford it

that would bring tons of happiness

you know

so

once you take care of those basic necessities

so we'll say makeover hypothetically a million dollars

no

it

it really doesn't like adding an extra zero going from 10 million to 100 million or whatever it is

makes no difference

so you're given that or just fearless and spending the money

yeah

well

let me reframe

i guess it could for some people

if

if you really i don't know you spent your whole life obsessing over cars

# Chapter 9

and like

you know

if my brother had a medical emergency and and we couldn't afford it

and i made money to afford it

that would bring tons of happiness

you know

so

once you take care of those basic necessities

so we'll say makeover hypothetically a million dollars

no

it

it really doesn't like adding an extra zero going from 10 million to 100 million or whatever it is

makes no difference

so you're given that or just fearless and spending the money

yeah

well

let me reframe

i guess it could for some people

if

if you really i don't know you spent your whole life obsessing over cars

it probably would bring you a little bit of joy to buy a nice lamborghini

i

i'm coming more from the frame of mind of of an entrepreneur

someone who's really obsessed with business ability for me and a lot of my friends and people

i hang around

what brings us

happiness is winning and building companies

and do you know

changing the world like that

that is fun

it's a complex problem

you can wake up every day and it gives you something to obsess over and devote your life to

where it's just having money

doesn't you know

well

one interesting question for you psychologically

so

because you have become wealthy and because you give

like

part of your work is giving away a lot of money

um

do you find it hard to find people you can trust is do people see you basically as a source of money as opposed to another human being

it's weird because you would think

yes

but i i feel like i also know the right places to look

um

but yeah

if i just walked into target and try to make friends with 10 random people

of course

um

you gotta

uh

so you can kind of sense

oh

yeah

that's the right thing

yeah

that's

yeah

it's so obvious

so i don't even want to go into descriptions

but honestly

a lot of my friends are like

uh

chandler

i i played literally with him

um

and tyler

the guy

i mean i went to school with him

chris

he was my first subscriber

um

carl was here after we got big

but whatever

he's friends with the boys

and it is a lot of my closer friends

even like my youtube friends

i i knew before i was big

so maybe there is some mirror to that

maybe it is

i

i don't know

i've never really put too much thought into it

maybe there's a reason i hang around a lot of these people i knew before i got paid

because it's much easier and they help you keep

like

uh

your radar sharp of who can and can't be trusted

because you know you can trust them

yeah

it's difficult when you become richer and richer and more powerful

well

one day

one time when you get rich

oh yeah

not even richer

but more fan

one thing i thought is

as i climbed this like ladder of youtube and got bigger

i thought there would be tons of people like me

people

how to like that

takes

like the kamikaze approach to building a business

you just throw all your money in it

you throw all your time

you throw all your energy throw everything

yeah

you're just like

fuck it

this is this

i'm dead

yeah

i thought there would be hundreds of these

yeah

and and there isn't there is

i mean there's like maybe one or two and i talked to those motherfuckers every single day

i'm sick and tired of talking to them

but i love them

um

but it's just so interesting

because like every level i got up like i get a million subscribers

like all right

where's all these guys in the million subscribers that are fucking psychopaths

and then you know

you know

there are people become like conservative as they get

like

they get more

especially as they get bigger

yeah

and you know

20 million subscribers

30. it's like every step of the way

it's like i just got more and more lonely

to be honest

since you

you know it sounds cliche and you hear that kind of shit in movies and you're like

that's not how it works

but it is like there's

there's just not many people that just want to give up everything

go all in and obsess over making the greatest goddamn videos every single day of their life

like they're really hard to find and be able to sacrifice everything for that video

yeah

like

basically you put all the money right back in

yeah

or the people doing it

they're on just a small scale

and if i talk to them

it's just 99. 9 of the time i'm teaching them things

and it's like

so it's lonely

because there's not too many people especially in the creative space that are as crazy as you

yeah

it is 100

it's

it's

so

it's not what i

i was expecting

i was expecting there'd be a lot of people like me

but well

i guess the guy would talk to elon musk

is a bit like you in

that sense

yeah

just in a different domain

yeah

yeah

exactly

just willingness to put it all back in right

and that's why i found right now

a lot of the people i relate to don't even make youtube videos like they're just like i'm viewing more

and more away from fellow content creators and more to just

you know

i'm just looking for those other people who just share a little bit of it

so i don't feel so fucking crazy all the time

like you know what i mean

um

and

like people

i feel normal around and they tend to just be doing the randomest things

but you know

loving it well i think that's really inspiring

it's

uh

it's like the bukowski line to find what you love and let it kill you is really put everything

put everything into the thing you love

that

that's like the way to really create special stuff

but it's also the way to

yeah

you have to be careful

given this advice

because they're like

they're like bodybuilders who'll be like

just go to the gym

be disciplined

i'm disciplined

go to gym

but i would argue for those people

it's like it's not even discipline

they just enjoy weightlifting right

because there are people who are jacked

but they don't make much money or run a business

right

if they're that disciplined

they would

they would be hitting every area of their life

they just really like business

and there's people like me who just to an extreme level

love building companies

right

it's not even discipline for me

it's just in my blood

it's what i wake up

i don't think about it

i don't push myself

i don't need to watch a fucking motivational video to go work

i just do it

it's programmed in me at this point and i couldn't imagine a world

where i don't wake up and do it every day

um

but i think that a little bit of it is genetics

um

and just how you're hardwired

uh

not that it can't be trained or taught

and not that you know

and obviously the friend group you're in influences these things

and over time i think can change it

but someone's just not gonna be able to flip a switch

and then just start doing a kamikaze approach to building a business

just like a lot of people try to flip a switch and start bodybuilding and quit

majority of the time

you know

that's just not innate to them

but i think a lot of us have the capacity to do that in some domain

yeah

i think

if you went about strategically

if you surrounded yourself with fellow like-minded people and you know

slowly over time

switched it

uh

but if you just try to like hardcore

do it

you're just going to lose your mind

do you ever worry about your mental health

did you take step to protect it to

uh

yeah

to like for the long run

to make sure you have the mental strength to go on

yes

weirdly

enough

the best thing for my mental health was giving in to my innate nature to work

and the most depressed i get is when i try to restrict it and like i don't work weekends

so i don't work this day

what's best for me is just to work when i feel like working

and then just not work when i don't like and just have no constraints

because there are just some nights where i don't want to sleep

and for whatever reason i feel compelled to go all night

whatever like

just do it

you know

do

whatever you want

it's what i tell my like working brain

um

and i just give in to it and i feel that's where i feel the happiest

and and then

um

you know

it's typically like when i'm really in the grind mode

it'll be like seven or eight days

it's just non-stop going going

and then it's like

oh

i'll realize like

oh

i need some recharge time and then go fucking binge a season of anime

yeah

but listen here

but that's the thing

like people will tell you don't work weekends or don't do this or don't work past this or blah

blah

give you all these constraints

but for me

and it's unconventional

i just give into it

i think there's something really to be said for that

i i try to surround myself with people that

like what i don't

when i pull an all-nighter they don't go

like you should get more sleep

there's a reason i pulled that all-nighter like

if i'm really passionate about something

they say

they basically encourage it because i i have no problem getting sleep and getting rest

um

what i need in my life is people that encourage you to kind of keep going

keep going with the thoughts that you're passionate about normal people

they don't want that life and they probably shouldn't

it's not good for you

um

but yeah

is

if you hang around people like just whatever

different people you're gonna feel crazy and it's gonna wear on you

whereas

if you're around similar people

it just it's so much easier

like if you

you know

um

i've started weightlifting more

and like

one thing that's helped is just having jack people around me because they naturally just eat healthier

they do

like

they naturally just have freaking grilled chicken and all this shit and high protein meals

and it's just like easier for me to just piggyback and be like

oh

can you just order me whatever you're getting

uh

and they're like

i gotta go to the gym and i'll be like

oh shit

i'll just join you

you know

and it's like

it's just it's cheat codes

you know

i mean

just surround yourself with people that you want to be

and it makes it like 70

easier

in my opinion

it's like that is the cheat code to life

um

and i wish i

obviously

your audience is definitely a lot older

but you know

to the older people listening like

if you have

are in a place of mentorship for someone younger or have influence over younger people

you should really try to drill

that in their heads like the people are there around 100 dictates the outcome

i would not be on 120 million subscribers

if i didn't find

uh

when i was around a million

i had a couple friends that were just also psychopaths

you know

i outgrew them

but at the time it was great

and i wouldn't be where i am today if it wasn't for them

um

and just all along the way

the friends that i hung out with had such a dramatic impact on wearing them

like

i'd probably have 80 million less subscribers

you know

if it was

if i wasn't so strategic about hanging out with people that i add value to

and they also add value to me

so the advice for young people would be to be very selective about the people you saw yourself

so selective

it's

it's crazy

like chris

you know he's i

i

he's really funny and that's why he's great for the videos

and part of why he's so funny is he consumes copious amounts of cartoons and just funny content

and so i'll find

like

when i spend more time with chris

i'll start just quoting these weird cartoons and shows

and like my speech will literally change

and just after like a week of spending more time with them

it has

like

it's like that quick enough effect

you know

now

picture that over the course of years

i mean

yeah

it has such a huge influence

like pluck one of their friends out and hypothetically put me in there

and yeah

you know

there's no doubt if they're trying to become a content creator

there are odds of success is 10x

right

obviously you can't do that

but you got to find your closest version of it and just be selective

yeah

but this also applies not just to younger

to older people to agree

but they

it's

it's even more

i like when i was a teenager

i just

you know

i couldn't relate to many people

i just i was like a fucking freaking nature

because no one was obsessed with building businesses or any of this kind of stuff

and so like

back then

you know that advice would have been helpful

maybe not that particular

but just knowing that there are

you know

it's not that you're a freaking nature

you just haven't found people that have the same interests

so the task is not to feel sorry for yourself or somehow change yourself

it's more to finally find people you fit in with

yeah

yeah

assuming which you know

you're not getting comproment

uh

like

assume

it's not something bad

right

like

if your hobby is shooting things you know or shooting things

you shouldn't be shooting

you know

don't find people that encourage that

but outside of that

for sure

uh

actually

as an answer to what is the best advice someone ever gave you

you said you're crazy until you're successful

then you're a genius 100

all along the way

people gave me so much

you know advice on why i shouldn't be doing it

why i'm crazy

every step of the way

people wanted to tell me why i shouldn't be doing this and should get alive

should stop being too obsessed

everything

everything under the book

um

and then

once i'm successful

those same people are like tank

you're a genius

wow

you

really

you pulled that off

those are probably the same people that will give you advice

now you're the most successful video creator of all time

stick to that anytime you want to do something new

right

yeah

uh

they'll

they'll like pressure you not to do the um

you know

feastables or or mobile gaming or whatever lays beyond

yeah

it's funny how people don't well

honestly

they're the type of people i just don't talk to anymore

i don't even know what they have to say now

so most people on the team are like yes

and they're like whatever

the idea you got

they

they're with it

no

it's weird

we actually have a

my team pushes back on me pretty hardcore

which i want

i don't want yes man

and yeah

they're

they're like

uh

they're james

you know

the ceo who helped me build all this

um

he's very adamant

like we're not yes men and and he trains people to really think for themselves and even

when i give them orders like really think like

is this optimal

is there context

or information jimmy could be missing that i can provide that could help him make a more updated decision

like i'm not

um

god

you know

what

i mean

like i'm human

i make errors and so don't take what i say

that's the bible

so even

like in the brainstorming

and so on

they can

they can push back

yeah

you can see it

like tyler

anytime i said something

he would give me feedback and push back

which is what i want

i don't want him just to be like

yes

you're fucking genius

good job

jimmy

you know i don't need that

you know

i need negatives

uh

you talked about being in a relationship

what role

jimmy does love playing the human condition

i think

well

roll this

well

the big thing is love can be scary

because this is

you know

the human you're gonna spend the most amount of time with in your life

you know

and so

for projected over 50 years

they can be a liability or an asset

i love the magic tricks

you know

i love

no

but seriously

it's got to be someone that makes you better for me

i can't truly love someone that doesn't make me better

because

yeah

in the long run

yeah

across

across

because

if not

then it's like it's a negative

you know

to everything i've spent my life building

yeah

um

but luckily i'm very happy with the

the partner i haven't like we were talking about before

i do think she makes me better

there's a lot of actually positives

i've noticed

even things as simple as

like

you know

i struggle to turn off my brain at night

because i'm just thinking about all the businesses

and how we could do better or whatever weird thing i have on my mind

but you know

just chatting with her

and hanging out with her helps me like basically just shut my brain off and like mellow out

and even

like there's just a ton of little things like that that i've noticed are positives

especially when you really look for them that are easy to gloss over

if you're not

um

and so for me

yeah

i have someone who i think it's very beautiful

very intelligent

makes me better

it's constantly pushing me

okay with me working hard

makes me smarter

and just all these different things that i think for me love just makes me a better person

you know what i mean

which makes me love her even more

does that make sense

absolutely

what advice would you give on

uh

finding somebody like that

um

just really don't give up until you

you find someone that you know

there's so many people on the planet

i mean there really is there

there's billions of the odds are in your favor of yeah

like

just don't settle and find someone that you know makes you happy

yeah

just like you said

surround yourself with people that make you a better person

in the same case

surround yourself with that one special person that really makes you a better person and for

and maybe that's just an entrepreneurial brain

looking at it

not everyone's to hyper optimize their life like me

but for me to like

truly love someone

they have to make me a better person in every way

yeah

yeah

well

what do you hope you're 24. we thought we started talking about death

let's let's finish talking about death what do you hope your legacy is

when you

when we look a hundred years from now

and

yeah

alien

the ai has completely taken over and the aliens visit and discuss with the ai

what this last of special humans that existed on earth was like

what

what do you hope they say about you

um

it's a deep one

as probably just that

# Chapter 10

but for me to like

truly love someone

they have to make me a better person in every way

yeah

yeah

well

what do you hope you're 24. we thought we started talking about death

let's let's finish talking about death what do you hope your legacy is

when you

when we look a hundred years from now

and

yeah

alien

the ai has completely taken over and the aliens visit and discuss with the ai

what this last of special humans that existed on earth was like

what

what do you hope they say about you

um

it's a deep one

as probably just that

because it's hard

right

like i said before elon is over double my age

i could live every second i've lived up to this point in my life and still have elon's age

so i have so much time

i just hope whatever it is that it's a net positive on the world

and it impacts billions of people in a positive way that makes lasting change

so you admire people like steve jobs

and elon musk for having sort of reached for that goal as well

yeah

of course

to help to help millions

i mean the iphone's the most successful product ever invented

it's hard not to admire what he created

you know

um

the same with

sort of

as johnny ive talks about

like the

the passion the effort they put into the designing the iphone that

like little bit of love is transferred to the whole world

like they get to experience the joy of that from the designer

it's what a beautiful thing to do

you know

i mean i couldn't think of anything better

you know

to create something that

even after you're dead for decades

just has such a profound impact on basically half the human population

yeah

it's wild

brings joy to people

yeah

um

well

i hope you do just that man

you've already done it for millions and millions and millions and millions of people

and i hope you keep doing it

i'm ex

i can't like

it's so exciting to see what happens this year and next year

i know

like this is the limit

yeah

i can't

i mean

uh

the videos

but ever all the other businesses

you're in and you

as a human being

as you grow

i can tell

i know

as everyone knows

you have a kind heart and the fact that you're really damn good at

uh

actually using that kind of heart to help a lot of people

it's awesome to see man

i appreciate it

more importantly

before we go

yeah

are we gonna play dune tonight

it's important

i'm gonna play dude

i have to

i have

you don't want one hour

you don't want to play board games with me

i wanna

i'll play

i'll play four games

if if only i wasn't an idiot and actually flew to the right airport

yeah

i do more games with me

they're gonna dislike the video
