# Chapter 1

okay well

 welcome here i said

 i would try and talk a little bit about the history of physics that's particularly

 pertinent to me right now because for the last several months i've been very busily working on physics

 and actually

 have some super exciting

 things that i figured out that

 i'm hoping to talk about early next week

 so this consider to say a precursor

 of some of the things that i want to talk about next week about

 sort of progress in understanding fundamental physics

 what

 i wanted to do here today was to discuss a bit some

 of the some of the history of physics as a field

 and how we've kind of got to where we are now

 so

 um

 let's start at the beginning the question is

 how does the world come to be the way it is and in

 every culture there

 have been creation myths you know

 some of the more extreme ones

 you know the world is made on the back of a turtle and

 it's turtles all the way down and so on but there are there's always a creationist

 and when it was written it was written in the terms of explanations

 which were available

 at the time and some of these creation myths seem to us these days mere

 analogies allegories etc actually

 they often have quite interesting things to say

 if one sort of is prepared to translate them back into the sort of explanatory

 framework of the time but

 i suppose that you know if we look at ancient civilizations the ones about

 which we probably know the most in terms of their thinking are the babylonians

 and the greeks both of them had sort of important precursors to physics

 and we should start off talking about those so as far as the babylonians were concerned

 but first of all you know the babylonians kind of did

 one thing very right which was that they wrote down things on clay tablets and

 those clay tablets survived

 and like i even see if i actually can

 pull it out there

 we go yeah sample

 clay tablet there we go let's

 say that's a little babylonian tablets not a very exciting one it's just

 what i happen to have that's a it's a it's a barley contract

 about somebody delivering

 selling barley delivering it in different months and so on but this thing is about three

 four thousand years old and what's

 what's neat about abalone e'en things is that they've survived

 and you know other civilizations that wrote another media

 didn't survive so what do we know about what the babylonians

 did in terms of physics they had astrologers

 who would try

 and predict things they would try and predict you

 know where planets would be at a certain time in the future whether

 it would rain tomorrow who would win or lose a battle turns

 out they were right that there's a systematic way for scientists in effect to predict

 where plants will be there's not such a systematic way to predict weather rain tomorrow

 and there's not really a good scientific

 way to predict weather or a king will win or lose a battle

 so

 it's kind of interesting to see that in those times

 it wasn't play which of these would be will be the relevant

 thing but they studied a lot astronomical phenomena

 and they had essentially an empirical theory of lots

 of things about the motion of the moon and so on they had pretty elaborate mathematical calculations that gave

 essentially

 sort of formulas in terms of what would we would today call us that were primitive version

 of fourier analysis that

 describe the motion of the moon and they they would

 keep data about that over the course of hundreds

 and hundreds of years and that's

 how we know and some of the ancient astronomers knew things about eclipses

 and were able to measure all

 sorts of features of of the heavens based on the records that the babylonians had kept but

 the real tradition i think in babylon starting

 maybe four thousand years ago was

 this kind of empirical tradition of let's

 observe the heavens let's fit the data let's

 make what amounts to a mathematical formula

 for what we see and that's

 what we talk about now

 maybe they had more kind of conceptual things but they didn't those those were not recorded

 so in different tradition there was kind of the the the greek tradition of

 thinking about things

 which was very much more of a philosophical tradition very much more of a theoretical we

 can come up with ways to understand the world just by thinking about stuff

 and you know from early times like folks like pythagoras 500 ish bc

 the was thinking about sort of can we use numbers to explore everything

 and you didn't really make a distinction between numbers to understand musical harmony numbers

 to understand kind of the soul numbers

 to understand the physical world it was just like there's there's an abstract framework with

 which we can think about the world that was kind of the the meta thing that

 he was thinking about well then

 but particularly there pre-socratic philosophers 400 bc things like that people like democritus

 and so on they were very big on on let's just have a philosophical

 foundation for

 how the world is made and democritus

 famously thought about atoms automa

 as these indivisible units from

 which the world will be made i think the most important thing that we

 see from some of this early philosophical thinking about the world is this idea that yes

 you know the world can be made of lots of for example identical objects

 and there's kind of a formal theory of how the world might be made

 now

 you know there were thoughts that you know maybe the world is made out of lots

 of little platonic solids conveniently

 here there are a couple of convenient photonic

 solids in this gets made out of wood rather than out of that the

 stuff the universe might be made out of but none of those the idea

 that you know so

 one of the five platonic solids might represent water

 one might be fire things like this and that somehow there was a way to explain

 how the world was made in these kind of formal

 essentially mathematical terms

 well you

 know i suppose the lot

 of kind of the wisdom of the ancients was passed down to more modern times through

 the works of aristotle i mean i sort of view aristotle as the great cataloger

 i mean he would write lists of animals

 and plants

 and causes of things structures of arguments that were turned into logic

 and he also had kind of a a sort of a catalogue of the

 way the physical world works

 and had sort of explanations

 based on kind of pure philosophy of how to think about them the way the physical world works

 so

 that was kind of the tradition of the

 the things that it's like we can figure out the world just by thinking about it i

 i think that one of the more interesting examples of that

 person called lucretia roman

 person maybe 60 bc

 who wrote a book called on the nature of things fairly fairly general sounding title but

 um you know he was trying to understand

 how the world works and

 how one could put together a thing

 like the world and he had it kind of an interesting analogy

 which i liked very much he said maybe the world is put together from underlying

 elements like atoms in kind

 of the way that we might put together a sentence out of words with

 a certain grammatical structure

 so it's kind of a way of describing a formal structure from which through

 which the world can be built from sort of underlying elements

 and i think kind of you know i think he was kind of right about the

 way it would work he

 didn't have any of the tools he didn't have computers

 he didn't have all these kinds of things to

 to to work with him to think in terms of

 but that was kind of an interesting idea

 i mean of course he at the time there

 were little computers there were mechanical

 computers like the antikythera device

 which

 you know was found in a shipwreck

 it's this sort of lump of things with a bunch of cogs that's

 a surprisingly elaborate mechanical

 computer actually i think cicero mentions the existence of such a thing we

 don't know how common or not those were in the ancient world but in a sense this clockwork

 computer type idea did

 exist in ancient times at least we have one sample of its existence

 so it's sort of interesting that

 what

 might have emerged if kind of computation

 had become more widespread in those times i mean it's it's worth understanding that

 this notion of sort of the clockwork way of things working

 that different from the mathematical structure of the way the babylonians thought about kind of the their

 explanation of for the positions of planets and the moon and things like this well

 okay so so in terms of ancient times i mean another kind

 of tradition of ancient another sort of thing in ancient times with the development of mathematics

 and mathematics

 had been partly developed as

 sort of a practical thing in babylon for doing commerce

 for computing financial kinds of things for doing land surveying that was kind of the origins of arithmetic

 and of geometry

 but it kind of reached a different

 level of kind of philosophical

 significance through the work of people like euclid maybe 300 bc euclid

 tried to axiom atomics

 he tried to say these are just things that we can say are true that

 we can then build up as a purely logical matter of deduction all

 of the things that we might know about for example geometry

 and it was completely unclear at the time to

 what extent like physics might be axia metal

 and to what extent the statement that euclid makes you know two parallel lines never meet to

 what extent that was a statement that was sort of a a fact

 that must be true about the world that was somehow in you know associated with physics

 or something that was merely a mathematical assertion from

 which you could prove things and it really took a long long time before

 sort of this this distinction between physics things

 that happen to be true about the world and mathematics

 things that are sort of deducible pure thought could really be distinguished

 and in fact i i would say that in very modern times we maybe are almost

 back to the point where we might be able to turn physics

 into a branch of mathematics again

 but that's for for the future but in a case the so

 you know this this tradition of kind of

 geometric reasoning

 and

 so on that euclid practiced

 and that very

 much fit him with a kind of greek tradition of let's figure out everything by pure thought now

 there was actual physics done like archimedes 250

 bc he did actual physics he computed things using mathematics

 but i think that he wasn't really in the let's understand

 and how the universe is really constructed

 he was more like

 well we kind of its kind of obvious in some sort of euclidean geometrical

 axiomatic way that such and such a thing is true about things in the world let's just compute

 how it works

 and that

 he was able to compute all kinds of things about volumes of solids and things like that and

 and connect some of those things to physics with things like you know his principle of displacement

 of volume by you know figuring out is this gold or not by by

 figuring out the density by knowing that things displace their own volume of something like water

 okay

 so the

 into in terms of other things that

 sort of happened in the ancient world by

 the time one was approaching

 sort of zero ad

 there were people like cabacas´s early astronomer who made a very nice star catalog

 and made lots of observations and

 so on by the time ptolemy 120 ad ish was

 around ptolemy kind of put together all these observations into this think of the almagest which

 for many many years was kind of the standard of

 how astronomy worked and the almagest was in

 a sense not really work of physics it was a work of kind of euclidian style mathematics applied

 to observations of astronomy

 and it was something

 where in the end he had this idea of epicycles

 which were

 essentially came from the babylonian tradition of let's let's make something

 where we can work

 out the motions of planets and things in his case by lots of kind of lots of spheres

 kind of rolling around on each other with certain particular sizes

 and particular detailed elaborate structures that were essentially a representation of mathematical formulas

 and i think that's most of what somebody like ptolemy really

 cared about was just the mathematical

 formulas that allowed you to predict things rather

 than the interpretation in terms of

 you know spheres rolling on each other which i i'm not sure how much that

 was really thought about or

 how much anybody cared about that interpretation i think it was much more the practical

 let's see how we can make astronomical predictions

 well

 okay

 so so then

 after that i mean for a long long time the works of hipparchus ptolemy

 and so on most

 of the works of the pockets i think were lost so it was really ptolemy's almagest that

 was kind of the standard for astronomy

 / physics for more

 than a thousand years it

 finally got kind of people start cleaning it up a person called regiomontanus was

 was big on sort of doing a big cleanup of of the sort of post you

 know could one make the next step in physics

 or astronomy after ptolemy

 and really you

 know one of the significant next steps was copernicus all the way in 1514 i think

 where

 copernicus was kind of working in the ptolemaic british tradition in terms of epicycles

 and you know you can understand

 that these sort of things roll on these things and you can understand

 the motions of planets that way and so on and you realized well actually it's

 a lot simpler you can you can make a sort of technical

 change in the way things work

 and you can make it a lot simpler

 if you don't imagine that

 the sun goes around the earth doesn't

 really matter to the mathematics whether

 the sun goes around the earth or the earth goes around the sun but

 you can avoid some technical

 details if you assume

 that the sun is at the center

 and the earth is going round isn't the other planets going around those

 and

 so he kind of introduced that as largely a technical innovation very late in his life

 and i think

 what was interesting in a sense to me about that is that

 yes

 it was a technical innovation didn't

 even give better results

 didn't get better results than ptolemy actually i think he gave worse results than ptolemies

 way of setting things up

 but in a sense there was a a certain it started kind of a shockwave of a realization that

# Chapter 2

 change in the way things work

 and you can make it a lot simpler

 if you don't imagine that

 the sun goes around the earth doesn't

 really matter to the mathematics whether

 the sun goes around the earth or the earth goes around the sun but

 you can avoid some technical

 details if you assume

 that the sun is at the center

 and the earth is going round isn't the other planets going around those

 and

 so he kind of introduced that as largely a technical innovation very late in his life

 and i think

 what was interesting in a sense to me about that is that

 yes

 it was a technical innovation didn't

 even give better results

 didn't get better results than ptolemy actually i think he gave worse results than ptolemies

 way of setting things up

 but in a sense there was a a certain it started kind of a shockwave of a realization that

 what you think is true like you think the earth is stationary

 and stuff is moving around you might not be true you

 might be able to do something that is kind of a scientific thing

 and work out something

 which is completely another obvious to our senses

 and i think that was kind of the at

 a meta level the really significant feature of what copernicus did and

 in fact there was sort of much more philosophical runoff from what copernicus did then there was scientific

 kind of developments of what he did that came rather slowly the philosophical implications i think were

 in many ways much bigger they were like the you know science

 really knows what it's talking about

 and might it might be different than what you can perceive with your senses

 but science is going to be right and your senses are going to be wrong and

 that's kind of a tradition

 that has existed pretty

 much to the present day and has been sort of amplified

 over time i think

 there's some problems with that tradition actually and

 um

 which we may talk about towards the end here well anyway

 so

 after copernicus

 there was well

 i suppose the next the next sort of really big set

 of things that started happening were things that galileo was doing late 1500s you

 know really galileo's i think big

 initial contribution was the idea of yeah

 you can really use math to

 talk about physical kinds of things so for example the discovery that a parabola might

 be relevant for the motion of a projectile the

 the realization that they're things like things that are really mathy

 i mean things like parabolas had been have been discovered as algebra well

 they did they'd had could have precursors in in antiquity

 but they'd really sort of come to the fore when algebra started getting developed in the 1400s

 and so on um the i think the

 so

 so kind of the the the next big step was

 yes mathematics could sort of be directly

 and trained with

 with physics by the way it had already been known in antiquity that in optics kind

 of the the theory of kind of optics is very close to geometry it's all about lines

 and angles and things like this and even euclid for example had actually written a book about optics

 which is lost

 and it

 was it was something considered to be sort of almost a branch of mathematics so to speak

 so there had been tradition there of sort of mathematical things applied to ideas like optics

 but when it came to mechanics that hadn't really been been such a tradition

 and galileo was kind of the one who really really started pushing that well then the

 sort of the big the big surprise was 1608 when

 when galileo you know the telescope had just been invented

 and galileo

 sort of found out about it and improved it there's

 sort of a possibly apocryphal story that galileo had galileo

 who was kind of a rather

 pugnacious fellow and and quite an activist

 but he was also he got himself a lot lots of kinds of trouble

 but but there's a perhaps apocryphal

 story that he had sold

 the rights to his version of the telescope to the merchants of venice because

 they really wanted to go up that that

 big tower in the middle of venice that's

 still there and figure

 out you know whose ship be

 the first person to figure out whose ship had come over the you

 know whether whether a particular ship was was

 going to come home or not and look out at the horizon and having

 a telescope to be able to do that was really a big advantage it kind of has has

 a reminiscence of modern times with high-frequency trading

 and so on where it's you know get a better faster fiber-optic cable to know what's

 happening in london if you're in new york and things like this but back

 in those days that was you

 know the merchants of venice with galileo telescope

 running up that that

 big tower in the middle of venice and so on but anyway so the apocryphal

 story perhaps was that galileo had sold the exclusive

 rights to terrestrial uses of the telescope to the merchants of venice so

 he had no choice but to then try using it for something different point

 the telescope to the side sky those rights were not used were

 not will not sold and in 1608 that's

 what he did and probably

 the most dramatic thing he discovered was the moons of jupiter why

 was it dramatic to discover the moons of jupiter well

 because you know it had been claimed by copernicus

 and

 so on that you know the earth was going around the sun things like that this

 was kind of like a miniature solar system that

 was operating around jupiter and it kind of also gave

 the sense that some of these kind of principles of physics that

 we kind of had an idea applied

 and the terrestrial domain also would apply to things in the heavens

 and things that were like things orbiting jupiter

 and so on so it was sort of a big a big realization that

 that these kinds of

 essentially mathematical

 type principles that had been that

 was starting to be applied to mechanics in a terrestrial domain could also apply to mechanics

 everywhere else and it kind of was the it started to speak to kind of the universality

 of physics across

 the whole universe that it really wasn't any different what

 was going on in the heavens than what was going on on earth and

 and so on and that kind of started

 a chain of thinking that i guess we could say led to most modern mathematical science

 and a lot of modern technology and engineering and

 so on so anyway that was that was the sort of a big moment for for science

 um

 later on galileo started having

 oh i don't know principles of describing science

 and important bombers but these days called galilean invariance the

 idea that it's really no different if you're stationary

 or if you're traveling at a certain speed the

 laws of physics always look the same that was important

 if you wanted to describe look you

 know the earth doesn't have to be stationary the earth can just be moving at constant

 speed and it will seem like everything is the same as

 if it was stationary

 and that's that's why we can't tell with our sensors that

 the earth is moving around the sun rather than the other way around well

 okay once the moons of jupiter were discovered all

 kinds of things for example the fact that the speed of light was not infinite was discovered by

 1670 1680

 by making observations on the moons of jupiter

 so it was already known that light didn't travel at infinite speed i'm not sure but

 any great significance was

 put on that it

 was known of course that sound didn't travel at an inference speed it

 was came clear that light travelled much faster than sound but

 okay

 well meanwhile

 there was there was all sorts of question about sort of the nature of light for instance like

 snell's law which is the law that determines

 how refraction

 works when you when you have a light ray that goes from like air to to to

 water that that law of that sort of trigonometric law of of

 the angle that the light ray will take snell's law that was in 1620

 and then

 through the 1600s there

 were a bunch of kind of what we might say the obvious linear

 laws of physics that got discovered

 so for example boyle's law for gases mid 1600s hookes

 law for springs that the the force on the extension of a spring is linearly proportional to to

 how much you extend it there was like 16 sixties i think um then

 the friction law or the law of friction that says that

 the the frictional force is proportional to a constant that depends on the material times

 the normal force times the amount of force

 that that pushes the thing down onto

 the surface and that

 was kind of a late 1600s thing well i think leonardo davinci

 already had some ideas

 about how friction worked i mean it's kind of interesting that all those laws we understand boyle's

 gas law very well now we

 understand hookes law for springs very well now the

 law of friction we actually still don't understand that well it's

 still kind of mysterious exactly

 how

 and why that works and

 and

 so on so it's kind of interesting that these things that get discovered

 just like when the babylonians couldn't

 figure out you know which will be easier to predict the motion of planets whether

 it would rain tomorrow it's

 sometimes you have to have a big conceptual framework before it becomes clear

 what

 what is easy to understand

 and what is not easy to understand

 well

 okay

 so so one

 thing had been discovered even in antiquity was various electrical phenomena static

 electricity was no and there

 was also various magnetic magnetic materials were no and kind of curiosities no

 no great significance to them people then volta

 kind of started understanding that for example the you know the muscles were somehow electrical

 and then

 it became sort of it started to get more they started to be more and more interest in

 kind of what is electricity coulomb's law was

 late 1700s it was discovered that the force of attraction between charged objects is the

 is proportional to the inverse

 one over the the distance squared of the the between the objects

 and then

 so

 you know sort of slow progress on electricity magnetism things like that um i guess

 by this point let's see we're hitting about the 1800s

 so

 what happened then well let's see there was some

 so

 beginning of the 1800s people like thomas young had his wave theory for light and then as

 soon as that came in people

 were able to start

 doing all kinds of calculations i

 mean it had been very unclear

 what light was people knew about about

 interference of light the the for example newton's

 rings you know when you see a layer

 of oil you'll see these kind of light and dark rings

 and

 so on that are associated with the the we

 now know are associated with the thickness of the oil and

 how

 many wavelengths of light it corresponds to things like that i'm

 bill anyway there were they were kind of phenomena

 like that that had been seen and they were also phenomena

 that made it look like light was just

 a bunch of corpuscles

 a bunch of particles that

 would just go in straight lines kind of like a big big

 stream of these things and so

 i mean that we

 now know that there's sort of a duality between this light as photons

 and lightest waves thing

 but that didn't come until they until the 1900s

 but back in 1800

 pound 1801 i think thomas

 young was talking about you know the wave theory of light

 and that became a sort of more formal thing

 and within a decade or so people

 were able to do all kinds of elaborate calculations of diffraction

 and light and interference

 and so on it became kind of a thing that had been mathematics

 i mean it's it's worth mentioning that term in

 in

 oh

 yeah we forgot an absolutely critical piece of history

 which i i'm i'm shocked that i forgot

 because it's one of my kind of favorites

 and i'm just

 um i'm i was i was talking about kind of things in the 1600s

 and these kind of empirical laws of

 of

 of

 how things work before

 we get to the 1700s before we get to electricity before

 we get to light and so on we have to talk about newton

 and we have to talk about the the things that newton did actually the main things

 his big year was 1665

 which happened to be the year that cambridge university was closed

 because of the plague

 and newton went and hung out at his sort of ancestral home in lincolnshire

 i think um and ah

 and was thinking about stuff

 and came up with two pretty good ideas one was his law of gravity

 and the other was calculus

 um

 he didn't publish those things until 1687 his big book principia mathematica i

 mean it's the sort

 of the title of the book already tells you kind of something of the philosophical implications

 the title the book of the full title is translated into english mathematical

 principles of natural philosophy

 so sort of pre newton the the general thinking about

 how one thought about nature was

 as kind of a branch of philosophy as

 a natural philosophy the the the the basic thinking had been one

 just figures out how nature works by pure thought just like how aristotle

 had done it just like how democritus

 had done it and so on and but

 what newton was saying was no actually there are mathematical principles of natural philosophy now

 galileo had had some precursors to this but newton was kind of the full fledged you

 can figure out how the world works using mathematical principles

 and

 so he developed some mathematical principles particularly his laws of motion for a second

 and third law for example the you

 know the first law an object remains

 an object that isn't acted on by a force just remains in in motion

 in the same way it's been moving before at

 the second law it's

 you know force as mass times acceleration and

 so on now

 you know you might say in modern

 times the first law is obvious

 we know if you set

 something in motion it'll

 and you don't act on it by a force you know it's a it's a something

 on a on their table on a you know puck on an ice rink something like this you

 set it in motion we'll just keep going unless acted on by a force that

 seems really obvious to us today it's

 a lot less obvious

 if you don't have things

 where friction has been reduced to almost zero if you

 were dealing with kind of well we just you

 know you're pushing something through mud or

 you're just rolling something on the ground it's

 far from obvious that it will keep going

 and with

 if and that if a force isn't acting on it because actually a force

 is usually acting on it it's the force of friction and

 so this was a the idea that there was this sort of perfect

 version of this where the thing will just keep going

 and without

 if there's no force acts on it wasn't self-evidently

 obvious it was a it was really a mathematical

 idealization that was significant

 and that was newton's first law well

 newton then with his forces mass times acceleration and

 so on that immediately started asking

 well can you actually compute given

 that you know that forces equal the mass times acceleration what

 are the forces that act on things so

 one very important force that newton thought about when you think about astronomy was

 the force of gravity

 and then he had to work out well what is the force that gravity exerts

 and that's when he came up with his inverse square law of gravity this

# Chapter 3

 far from obvious that it will keep going

 and with

 if and that if a force isn't acting on it because actually a force

 is usually acting on it it's the force of friction and

 so this was a the idea that there was this sort of perfect

 version of this where the thing will just keep going

 and without

 if there's no force acts on it wasn't self-evidently

 obvious it was a it was really a mathematical

 idealization that was significant

 and that was newton's first law well

 newton then with his forces mass times acceleration and

 so on that immediately started asking

 well can you actually compute given

 that you know that forces equal the mass times acceleration what

 are the forces that act on things so

 one very important force that newton thought about when you think about astronomy was

 the force of gravity

 and then he had to work out well what is the force that gravity exerts

 and that's when he came up with his inverse square law of gravity this

 is universal law of gravity that between any two

 objects the force of gravity is the mass of one object times

 the mass of the other object divided

 by the square of distance between them all multiplied by some universal constant we

 now call capital g the

 so that was his kind of idea

 and his idea was that was gonna be the law of gravity that applied to everything whether

 it was the moons of jupiter whether it was the sun around the earth whether

 it was a comet in the solar

 system all these things the law of gravity would apply

 and

 the

 you know i've realized i i forgot another important term piece of this story

 which was let

 me i'm sorry to backtrack

 here but i just want to fill in one more one more piece which

 was around the time that galileo was was observing the moons of jupiter the

 another

 another important a little bit before then actually another important development was was kepler

 kepler was

 actually a very capable mathematician who

 had a completely wacky theory of the solar system it was kind of a an evolved

 version of the sort of copernican meets ptolemaic idea

 and his idea actually was to use the platonic solids as a representation of the of

 the motions of planets and to

 have these sort of concentric

 concentric platonic solids

 which happened by the mathematics the mathematical results on the on the distances of platonic solids

 if you threw it in estill the platonic solids inside each other it

 so happens that the results you would get for the ratios of their sizes agreed

 rather well with the known planets which went out to saturn at the time in

 in the solar system so

 so kepler was like we've derived this from mathematics we've got from mathematics we have derived

 what

 how

 the solar system works

 when the moons of jupiter were discovered

 he had to start having rhombic polyhedra

 as the way to describe those and it all got kind of kind of wacky but

 but kepler was even though his underlying theory was complete nonsense the

 the mathematics that he did was perfectly good and the mathematics he did both on polyhedra

 and more importantly

 the mathematics he did and realizing that the orbits of planets could

 be represented as ellipses

 and coming up with kepler's laws which

 were essentially empirical laws for the motion of planets derive

 from the mathematics of ellipses i had sort of forgotten to mention that i'm sorry that

 was something that that newton was then was

 then able to leverage because

 what newton did was to say okay given this universal law of gravity

 and these laws of motion then

 it's just a matter of mathematics to derive kepler's

 result that the motion of planets should be ellipses

 and the the just a matter of mathematics required

 some mathematical sophistication and that mathematical sophistication was the was the what originated calculus

 what caused newton to invent invent calculus was

 the attempt to work out given that force is equal to mass times acceleration acceleration is the

 rate of change of the rate of change of position how

 do you work out what the position is given that okay

 you use calculus to do that and

 so he had to invent the way to do that

 so that was 1687

 and

 and kind of what emerged from

 what newton did was some you

 could then just use newton's law of gravitation newton's

 laws of motion and calculus to compute all kinds of things one

 thing that was interesting was that you could compute stuff

 but it wasn't easy and that

 was kind of a new thing because it had tended to be the case that the things that

 one could actually compute

 from sort of first principles in a sense were kind of easy to compute

 i mean although the babylonians

 and the ptolemy

 and so on have had pretty elaborate empirical

 formulas the things were it looked it felt like you were starting from first principles

 had always been easy to compute actually

 it's sort of an interesting thing when newton was trying to compute the position of the

 motion of the moon it's

 kind of a kind of a good example and a lesson

 for those of us who do theoretical science newton

 had got all of his whole universal law of gravitation

 and this and that and then he tried to compute the motion of the moon

 and he has this long chapter of his principia

 where he computes it and the last sentence says but

 the apse of the moon is twice as great in

 other words newton got the wrong answer by a factor of two so you

 know one might be taught for in sort of the bacon ian tradition of experimental

 science if the experiment disagrees with your theory abandoned the theory

 but one

 thing that i've learnt in in my efforts of doing science when

 the stuff when the theory is strong enough when the theory has enough

 things going for it and has enough of a sort of aesthetic

 integrity to it keep going with the theory sometimes

 the experiments will turn out to be wrong

 or sometimes there's something wrong with the chain of deduction from the theory to

 the prediction for the experiments in the case of newton the problem was with the chain of deduction computing

 the three-body problem the problem of the earth moon and sun all having

 gravitational attraction to each other that's a very difficult mathematical problem

 in fact we now know that it isn't soluble

 in some sense in terms of sort of algebraic functions

 and things like this it's a it's a problem in which in

 which chaotic

 phenomena happen it's a very elaborate problem that's the problem where i think that

 it will turn out you can make any computation

 you can have a three body system that

 does any computation you want in other words the three body system is as sophisticated as any computation

 so the

 but anyway newton was

 able to work out sort

 of almost work out the motion of the moon other people later on steadily

 tightened that up by around 1901

 had really pretty good calculations of the motion of the moon one

 gets to test those every time there's a total eclipse it's a rather sensitive prediction of exactly

 where the moon is like

 when the most recent total

 solar eclipse that was visible from the us a couple years ago we

 were able to use sort of modern techniques to predict to the second when

 the when the path of totality would would

 hit in any particular point in

 on its path and i was a little bit concerned whether that would actually be correct

 because it involved all kinds of elaborate things including relativistic corrections

 and like kind of stuff

 so we were we had a website

 which lots of people used to work out when

 eclipse would arrive i was a little worried whether it would actually work correctly

 we had a person who

 worked at our company who happened to be on the the very western

 extremity of the of the us where the way they clips for sort of first touched

 and

 so

 it was was good to verify

 that yes at least when the eclipse first around it was indeed correct but

 in a case um you

 know back back to newton one of these sort of interesting there you

 can realized this thing about the fact that you know you can have a calculation that is

 where you can specify the rules for the calculation

 but it may be really hard to actually calculate

 what happens so he has a nice passage

 where he talks about some way he's very concerned about the the motion of the planets

 and things he says we don't know how the planets

 kind of originated in their motion and

 and that's kind of the hand of god to put them where they start

 but once they have started then we can in principle calculate

 where they will where they will end up but

 he says but to know from planets with all of their mutual effects on each other

 where

 they'll end up exceeds

 if i'm not mistaken he said the force of any human mind so

 in other words he was he was recognizing the fact that there was a computational

 difficulty in in working out the consequences of the theory that he developed well in practice

 lots of people

 worked

 on it and through the course of the 1700s into the 1800s there

 was more and more sophistication in the use of essentially

 calculus to do mechanical calculations

 i think in in ai was used both in terms of astronomical

 calculations celestial mechanics and also terrestrial

 calculations i think for some reason particularly

 british tradition was studying

 the motion of tops

 and these bizarre these

 the pole hoed and the hubble hood and all these all these weird phenomena about how

 tops move that was sort of a became

 i think a particularly british mathematical physics tradition an obsession

 but - in any case there was a increasing level of sophistication of

 what could be worked out using calculus

 and using

 essentially newtonian mechanics ideas

 and that was kind of the big development of the 1700s - to the early 1800s

 and i might say that that you

 know at the time of newton if you'd ask somebody

 what is the world fundamentally made of probably

 the answer that you would have got is it's made of corpuscles don't

 really know what those are but those are a little bit maybe like democratizes

 atoms we don't even know what they are um they're

 - somehow bound together by forces

 and post newton it was like well maybe they're bound together by gravitational forces

 but that was kind of the the meta idea for

 what the world might be made of although it

 wasn't something that was really studied in great and tremendous detail

 um when

 electrical stuff started becoming

 sort of a big thing in the 1800s i think

 people were more tended to say that there were electrical forces that were holding

 things together but sort of the the the thing of the 1800s

 in addition to sort of very elaborate development of of theories that were spin-offs of newton's mechanics

 and calculus

 i mean they're the main spin-offs that develops were

 solid mechanics and fluid mechanics

 the theory of stresses

 and solids

 and the theory of the flow of fluids stresses

 and solids turns out to be a much easier problem

 the flow of fluids the flow of fluids has this very complicated

 issue of fluid turbulence when a fluid flows rapidly

 a fluid is flowing slowly just sort of slides around objects

 and it does it in a laminar smooth layered way

 but when it moves quickly you get this kind of random turbulence that develops

 and to

 find a theory of turbulence is still something that hasn't been done i've tried to make some contributions

 to that myself and i think i understand

 now sort of the the the immediate answer to the question why is there randomness

 and turbulence i think we can now answer that question

 but in the in the 1800s as the theory of fluids was developing turbulence

 was sort of off the table

 it was just working out the the partial differential equations things like the navier-stokes equations that

 described sort of the the

 parts of fluid flow that you could work out using by solving differential equations using calculus

 and so on so

 anyway those were those were two big traditions of that time the

 the other the other big thing that was happening was electricity

 and magnetism

 i think the there were both observations

 and theories the i think the the faraday michael faraday 1830

 discovered

 electromagnetic induction the fact that when you wave a magnet around you you produce

 a voltage in a wire you can induce a current in a wire very

 critical thing for electrical machinery

 but that was discovered by faraday purely experimental ii then

 gradually was sort of the the idea of the notion of an electric field

 or a magnetic field a sort of a thing that was out there that had an effect

 so for example faraday was you know used to have make these do these demonstrations and

 so on where you have iron filings little tiny bits of iron sprinkled

 around and you put a magnet there and you'll see this actual pattern of the iron filings

 that is sort of produced by this thing you can't see that is the

 what he termed the magnetic field

 faraday wasn't that mathematically

 oriented but it sort of quickly became clear that that notion of a field was

 all connected with partial differential equations

 and then

 this sort of the the big thing that happened by

 the 1870s was was james clerk maxwell coming

 up with his maxwell's equations

 which were these sort of unified equations that described electric

 and magnetic fields

 um and it was

 it was very

 remember exactly when this was yeah

 so

 so it was it was actually within a decade

 after maxwell's equations one of one of the implications of maxwell's equations and

 one of the things that was sort of realized through the experiments

 that faraday had done was that electricity

 and magnetism were very closely connected that

 you could use magnets to make electricity you could use out tricity to make magnetism

 and

 so on and those that kind of that that unification really came together in maxwell's equations

 which are four equations partial differential equations that describe the the

 the the mechanics of electromagnetic fields they tell you how charges

 and currents electric charges electric currents make electric

 and magnetic fields

 and they tell you how electrical magnetic fields fit together and you

 know maxwell was a good mathematician and invented

 vector analysis something that all those div grad curl all those things that's all maxwell's although

 he he originally wanted to call curl twirl

 which might have been charming for the calculus students of the future um

 but anyway he settled on on curl eventually

 um

 but the

 but

 but anyway so maxwell's equations have made these statements about

 how electric

 and magnetic fields would work one of the implications of those was

 that there will be it would be possible to produce waves electromagnetic waves

 and within a decade hertz had observed electromagnetic

 waves and had figured out and had basically created the first radio

 and it didn't take very long it took come less

 than a decade before there was actual real radio being used

 and people were transmitting messages the had been given done on wires with telegrams

 and so on they were using you know in morse code they were sending messages

 purely through electromagnetic waves

 so that was kind of the the realization that tim that

 that came out of the mathematics that maxwell had done that

 there should be a magnetic waves and by golly there actually were electromagnetic

 waves and they made radio

 so

 so that was kind of the big

 development of of the late 1800s was this idea of electromagnetism

 electrical magnetic fields things like radios

 and those those sorts of things

 so

 the another

 so another thing that was happening in

# Chapter 4

 that there will be it would be possible to produce waves electromagnetic waves

 and within a decade hertz had observed electromagnetic

 waves and had figured out and had basically created the first radio

 and it didn't take very long it took come less

 than a decade before there was actual real radio being used

 and people were transmitting messages the had been given done on wires with telegrams

 and so on they were using you know in morse code they were sending messages

 purely through electromagnetic waves

 so that was kind of the the realization that tim that

 that came out of the mathematics that maxwell had done that

 there should be a magnetic waves and by golly there actually were electromagnetic

 waves and they made radio

 so

 so that was kind of the big

 development of of the late 1800s was this idea of electromagnetism

 electrical magnetic fields things like radios

 and those those sorts of things

 so

 the another

 so another thing that was happening in

 yeah i should have somebody on livestream is commenting on discovery of the vacuum

 so that was in around the time of the french revolution right

 so

 that was some

 so that was in the the 1700s the the realization that the air that is not

 that there's a notion of there being nothing there

 so to speak that you could make things where there isn't any air

 and

 where there's something

 where there's nothing there i'm not sure i think

 for chemistry that was an important realization i'm not sure that that was

 well ingested by the physicists

 and

 in fact there were a bunch of issues about what you

 know what the role the notion of whether a vacuum really really had nothing there

 so one of the important ones of those was some people knew about sound

 and they knew that sound was compression

 waves in in the air and you

 could also have sound in solids it was compression waves and solids

 and things like that and and people like helmholtz i think 1860s ish had

 developed a pretty complete theory mathematical theory of sound that

 um

 and

 rayleigh

 i think had had a version of this in fact his his book as i realm

 holtz and raley's books on sound i certainly

 have copies of them and i think they're pretty modern actually

 and there's not a lot time you can say more with more more

 or techniques

 but they pretty much had nailed the way sound works

 and the mathematics of sound waves and so on um

 but you know there was a question come to a little bit more later

 but but there was a question for electromagnetic waves we know that sound waves are compression

 and rarefaction waves in air in a material question is what are electromagnetic

 waves waves in and

 so

 this notion developed of this thing called the ether the so

 called in a very victorian sounding

 name the luminiferous ether the light carrying ether that

 was the the idea was that tim there was this this uncie unseen thing that

 was the analog of what air was to sound the luminiferous ether was to electromagnetic

 waves and that was kind of at the time of maxwell

 and people like that that was kind of the way people thought things worked

 so

 um the

 well another another important

 developments in the eighteen hundred sixteen hundreds were you know there's a physics

 really started galloping along after

 galileo and newton you

 know physics kind of got in gear and things really started to happen um

 and you know there's a lot of different kinds of phenomena in the world another

 important area is heat the the theory of heat the idea of temperature the theory of heat those

 kinds of things there's

 a big debate in the 1800's

 what is heat

 um

 and

 so

 it got a little bit weird

 and funky i mean it was already suspected in the eighteen in the 1600s

 that heat was somehow associated with the microscopic motion of the

 things that made up matter and even for example one of the bernoulli's had figured out that

 you know gases might be little molecules

 or bouncing around that was in the mid 1700s

 but that nobody really particularly cared about that

 i mean people were very much concerned about heat

 and and then when steam engines were invented

 it was important to understand kind of what

 was possible in steam engines sadi carnot worked

 out the the notion of an idealized steam engine

 and tried to work out how much how much energy

 you get from an idealized steam engine these kinds of things

 but this notion of what is heat what is the thing that corresponds to heat wasn't clear

 and it got kind of weird a little bit like the ether there

 was this notion of things like for gist on this this substance

 that would suffice things

 and that corresponded to heat

 um

 and

 this this idea that it was a that there was that heat wasn't a substance that

 was a property it was just a property of things not its own separate sort

 of you know separated kind of substance that was

 that took until the mid 1800s

 before that started to become clear and there started we experiment

 spew like jewel who

 did did experiments sort of about the inter convertibility of heat as

 and

 and other forms of energy

 and things that were known

 from mechanics things about the the energy of motion that

 was understood from mechanics

 and

 and by the way following newton

 and so on the idea of the conservation momentum

 the conservation of mechanical energy these

 were things that had emerged from mechanics

 but it wasn't clear sort of how heat fitted into that well then 1850

 ish sort of big big

 point the first law of thermodynamics the

 idea that heat is a form of energy and that the energy

 and mechanical work

 energy of mechanical work like kinetic energy is sort of interchangeable with the energy of heat and so

 that was that was kind of a thing of around 1850 people

 like klaus i think was involved in that um the this this notion of heat

 as a form of energy interconvertible

 with mechanical energy well the only thing was that it was clear it wasn't completely interconvertible

 because

 if you had something that was hot you couldn't immediately turn

 that thing that was hot you

 know into useful mechanical work

 and so it was kind of like why is that you

 know what was what's going on there and that's

 what became the second law of thermodynamics

 what we now often refer to as the law of entropy increase

 but back in those days it was kind of this this

 law that said you can't get my chemical work out of heat energy that easily

 um

 and

 so for example a common version of it would be the statement that heat

 doesn't spontaneously flow from

 a colder body to a hotter body that

 was one one version of the second law of thermodynamics

 but it became slowly clearer

 what

 um

 what the second law might be um

 and

 and this notion that i mean we now know that the issue is mechanical work involves

 you know you take this big lump of stuff

 and you started in motion

 and that means all the atoms

 and that big lump of stuff are all going in one particular direction

 if you just make the lump of stuff hot it

 means the atoms are moving around they're moving around very quickly

 but they're moving around in random ways and we can't kind of decode that randomness

 so that we can kind of organize it into this sort of systematic mechanical motion

 and that that failure to be able to organize

 it is i think the origin of the second law but we'll come to that um

 but anyway back in those days this notion of of the second law sort of emerged

 eighteen

 sixties ish kind of it was starting to be really talked about two big things happen

 so james clerk maxwell actually

 before he'd worked on electromagnetism i worked on kinetic theory he was he

 worked on a prize

 essay about the moons of saturn

 um

 and in it he invented

 what is now called kinetic theory he

 invented kind of the mathematical

 theory that describes you have a bunch of gas molecules bouncing around what

 can you say about

 the properties of those molecules so one big thing he said was the distribution

 of velocities of those molecules is this gaussian like distribution e to the minus mv squared

 um distribution

 that is now called the maxwell boltzmann distribution

 so that was a sort of a mathematics meets the kind of the mathematics

 meets the idea that gases are really a bunch of little little

 particle like things bouncing around that was a maxwell

 idea then along came ludwig boltzmann

 and

 eighteen seventy he had

 proved this thing called the h theorem

 so

 okay so they've been this idea

 and trying to characterize

 what heat was relative to other forms of energy they've

 been that idea i think due to klaus s that

 you could define a notion of what's called entropy

 which he defined as a thing that was essentially heat divided by temperature

 okay

 so what

 what boltzmann

 proved was on the basis of little

 gas molecules bouncing around he proved this thing called eh theorem that

 he said meant that he'd

 proved that the entropy as defined by classiest always increases

 and that's equivalent to statements like heat doesn't spontaneously flow from

 a colder body to a hotter body so

 covered through a lot of other kinds of statements

 um and

 so boltzmann

 said he proved that now his

 proof was kind of a bit of a sham it's an interesting mathematical proof but

 because it turns out the laws of physics are reversible at least in the sense in

 the sense that they whatever whatever

 the laws of mechanics have the property

 that if you can have two things that collide

 like this and go

 out like that you

 could sort of run the movie in reverse

 and they could come in from where they start from where they ended up and go

 back and get back to where you started from and

 so that reversibility was kind of boltzmann had gone from taking that a mechanical

 just like that and it proved that something irreversible happened was the so-called reversibility objection

 and that

 was a very obscure thing in fact it's one of my sort of favorite physics misguided ness

 things is that in textbooks modern textbooks they're

 often talk about the second law of thermodynamics they'll

 show boltzmann's proof of the h theorem they'll say well yes you can run everything backwards

 and

 how

 can it not how

 can you then conclude that entropy increases rather than decreases they'll

 often end with statements like the last sentence being this point is often puzzling to the student well

 actually been puzzling to everybody else too i think i finally figured

 out in the 1990s actually

 how this works

 and really

 the story is well

 it's it's the story is that it's happening is the everything is reversible

 but the dynamics of the system is effectively doing encryption on the initial

 conditions of the system so

 while in principle you could reverse it you

 need to be a crypt analyst to do it so to speak and in practice

 when we do experiments

 or make observations we're not as computationally sophisticated

 as we would need to be to do that reversal

 so even though looked

 at at a microscopic

 level everything is perfectly reversible it doesn't appear

 that way to an actual observer that that was a kind of an idea that

 josiah willard gibbs one of the early american physicists some from the early 1900's

 um he was big on this notion of coarse graining in statistical mechanics

 which was coming his version of saying the observer can't

 contem

 can't figure out at the level sort of molecule by molecule what's

 going on he didn't really have this computation

 idea but he just had the idea of you can't look at the individual molecules in what's happening

 i mean maxwell already had this thing called maxwell's demon but

 you've had a thought experiment we said imagine

 there are these two two

 sides of a box and there's a trapdoor in between them

 and there's this little very tiny creature who is watching when molecules arrive at that trapdoor

 and is deciding

 whether to send them to the left or to the right and with

 that demon you can always get a violation of the second law of thermodynamics by

 having sort of intelligence like that in the loop you can

 get this violation second law and that's kind of like saying that's

 a kind of the beginnings

 of saying you sort of need a crypt analysts to figure out what how to untangle

 the inexorable increase of entropy associated with the second law actually

 i should mention that one feature of the second law was

 that particularly late 1800s it was some it

 was kind of there was this whole question of was there a life force was

 there something about living systems about biology that

 was fundamentally different from physical systems

 and it's been a long-standing question of you know is there some spark of life that his goings

 beyond the physics the chemistry and

 so on and that was some that was what tim

 so the second

 law was often kind of invoked

 you know well most things show the law of entropy increase

 but living systems can

 sort of do the opposite well they can't really they can only do it temporarily and

 they can only do it in a sort of the maxwell's

 diminish kind of way at the level of individual molecules

 but doesn't really last but in a case that didn't become clear until

 well into the 1900s

 and

 and

 what really happened is this this notion of what were the foundations of the second law which

 i think is a fascinating thing

 it's one of the things got me interested in physics back

 when i was about 12 years old or something in 1972 was

 understanding things about the second law of thermodynamics

 and it's sort of a sort of shocking that that

 so little work has been done on it and when i finally figured

 out how i think it actually works i don't

 think anybody cares um

 but i think it's i think it's really interesting

 okay back to um i should

 mention you know by

 the way i mean by the time after

 the whole life force things sort of dissipated by

 probably the 1930s people had the point of view that the

 second law was just true it was a fundamental true fact about nature we

 sort of maybe kind of didn't maybe even need to prove it maybe or maybe boltzmann

 approved it or people

 were kind of confused about

 it i mean the the idea of entropy got kind of a boost in 1940s

 when claude shannon introduced

 the idea of information as

 a measure of sort of the compressibility of data

 because basically his information measure is exactly - the

 boltzmann's entropy measure

 okay

 so another big thing from the 1600s

 from the from sorry from the 1800s was

 was

 the the whole notion of atoms really becoming real and you

 know it had been known chemistry had developed a lot lots

 of chemical elements were known by the 1860 mendel sixties

 mendel af was sort of writing his chemistry textbook

 and making up the periodic table all those kinds of things people

 this this notion that there was a systematization of chemistry was becoming clear meanwhile

 people like dalton even

 the beginning of the 1800s had

 notice things about chemical reactions they noticed that when

 you wrote down chemical reactions you could things worked very nicely when

# Chapter 5

 it i mean the the idea of entropy got kind of a boost in 1940s

 when claude shannon introduced

 the idea of information as

 a measure of sort of the compressibility of data

 because basically his information measure is exactly - the

 boltzmann's entropy measure

 okay

 so another big thing from the 1600s

 from the from sorry from the 1800s was

 was

 the the whole notion of atoms really becoming real and you

 know it had been known chemistry had developed a lot lots

 of chemical elements were known by the 1860 mendel sixties

 mendel af was sort of writing his chemistry textbook

 and making up the periodic table all those kinds of things people

 this this notion that there was a systematization of chemistry was becoming clear meanwhile

 people like dalton even

 the beginning of the 1800s had

 notice things about chemical reactions they noticed that when

 you wrote down chemical reactions you could things worked very nicely when

 there was sort of integer multiples of things that showed up all over the place it

 was like there were two units of oxygen

 and one unit of hydrogen whatever

 it is for four different kinds of things or or and that

 but sort of it was a it was very convenient

 if you could just sort of numerologically

 arrange things by saying there's there's a discrete amount of hydrogen

 and there's you know there's twice as much hydrogen as there is oxygen in water

 and some sense and that there were these sort of simple multiples

 and so he kind of developed this idea that there must be an atomic theory that would underlie chemistry

 but it was done more at the level of sort of explaining chemical reactions meanwhile it

 had sort of been known for a while but it kind of was was was really um became

 clearer with a guy called robert brown discovered brownian motion

 it was they'd have been known for a long time that things like this happened that

 if you have a light enough thing he was looking at pollen grains it

 would be sort of discreetly kicked around

 if you

 were looking at it under a microscope and that discreet kicking around people

 sort of started identifying oh that's actual molecules

 that are like doing the kicking discreetly

 and so this notion that you know atoms that things are made of discrete stuff

 um was was pretty much established

 and by the time maxwell

 was talking about kinetic theory there was like yeah things are made of discrete stuff discrete atom like things

 what

 were atoms people didn't know actually one of my favorite kind of theories due to william

 thompson later lord kelvin was the idea that atoms were knots in the ether

 so remember this ether the luminiferous ether that that was supposed to fill the universe

 and be the thing that was the sort of carrier of light

 as air is the carrier of sound waves well

 so the idea was that knots you

 know there are discrete

 kinds of knots that you can time pieces of string there are different different

 kinds you can classify the knots that exist

 and kelvins

 idea was well you

 know it may be that

 we know there are discrete

 kinds of atoms maybe

 the kinds of atoms

 all correspond to knots and the ether a completely non stupid

 theory that turns out to be basically wrong

 at least in those let of that level but definitely not a not a foolish thing

 to think about and

 in fact the the whole the a lot of knot theory was was

 produced by a childhood friend of maxwell's

 no cousin called tate who started classifying

 knots to try and see would

 there be 92 of them just like there were chemical

 elements of that that number of chemical elements

 and so on

 okay

 so anyway

 so this takes us some

 let's see i think come i'm looking at questions from the live stream here this some

 this kind of takes us to pretty much the end of the 1800s in

 terms of what was happening so

 a couple of things happen

 right at the tail end of the 1800s first

 1895 discovery of x-rays by rod caen um discovery

 that you could have these these these

 things that would kind of go through matter

 and you

 know would make nice pictures of bones and wouldn't be would

 would not go through bones but would go through other pieces of us so to speak then

 very soon thereafter becker all discovered natural radioactivity

 and then 1897

 thompson

 discovered the electron discovered that electricity was

 also made of discrete stuff just like matter was made of discrete atoms so electricity

 was made of discrete things namely electrons well

 okay

 so there been a bunch of things that have been studied

 one thing that had emerged in the think 1880s

 or so was this notion of blackbody radiation

 so

 the question was when you heat something up it glows we know that what

 color does it glow what is the distribution of colors that what are the distribution of of

 colors of

 of electromagnet of so we know that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation

 and so

 when something is heated up and glows what colors

 does it produce as a function of temperature so there

 was a way of calculating that based

 on kind of standard based

 on the fact that there might be little generators

 little oscillators that would be like little radio transmitters

 except for light in the at in the in the material

 and there might be lots of these and they might all produce

 a certain spectrum of electromagnetic

 radiation problem was that calculation gave completely the wrong answer

 and by 1900 there were pretty precise measurements of what the actual blackbody spectrum was

 and

 so a chap called max planck decided he would fit that data

 and he realized that you could

 get a really good fit to that data if you assumed that somehow the that'd

 be that whatever it was that were these little oscillators

 that were producing lateral radiation

 was somehow quantized were in lumps a little bit like and he got him it

 wasn't it wasn't maxwell's distribution of of them

 from kinetic theory of distribution of speeds of molecules

 but was something a little like that a little bit different from that

 what we now call the bose einstein distribution

 that that

 would govern if if there were if sort

 of electromagnetic radiation was quantized it would be that would be the the form of blackbody

 of the spectrum of blackbody radiation

 so that was kind of the first idea of of quanta

 of quantization of something of in this case quantization of light effectively

 so it was already known there were discrete atoms there were discrete electrons for electricity

 but

 what about light well planck sort of had this empirical fit that said there could also be discreteness

 in light

 okay

 there was a thing called the photoelectric effect you

 shine light on something on some materials

 and they emit electrons basically

 they produce that the photoelectric

 effect is what's used for photo cells is what you what's used

 ultimately for the its

 yes i guess it's what's used for the imaging device that is the camera that i'm waving

 my arms that you guys using is that same photoelectric effect um

 but in any case the the photoelectric effect there were things knowing about the photoelectric effect about

 what frequencies of light would produce electrons etc etc etc 1905 albert einstein figured out that

 um

 if you believe planck's idea of discrete

 discreteness in electromagnetism

 if you had the notion of a photon a discrete particle of light you

 could explain the photoelectric effect um that's

 actually what einstein eventually

 won his nobel prize for cuz well it's of it he was way too too controversial still

 um was the the explanation of the photoelectric effect

 so also another

 thing that was happening right at the end of the 1900s

 was a thing called a michelson morley experiment

 michelson morley experiment was an attempt to detect

 what was called the ether drift so assume that the universe is full of luminiferous ether

 um the loomer the earth must be moving through the luminous verse ether at some speed

 but that means that somehow

 just like sound waves if you if

 you're moving through the air sound waves work differently than if you're stationary in the air

 and it should have been possible to detect that that change in the luminiferous ether as

 a result of the earth going around the sun at

 different times of year and so on you should see

 a different term different

 features of the transmission of light well

 they didn't see that and so

 that meant there was no ether drift this

 idea that there was this ether that sort of filled the universe

 and that was the carrier of light something was wrong with that idea

 now in the one of these typical ironies of history that kind of is a luminiferous ether

 and we kind of know that because it's

 well in some of the fundamental physics theory that that i have you'll see there's

 something it's a little bit bizarrely abstracted

 but it's something a little bit like that luminiferous ether

 but even this idea that

 there's nothing in the universe that sort of addressed that we're moving through that's not true

 the cosmic microwave background defines a rest frame for the whole of our universe

 and the earth is moving through it at one thousandth of the speed of light in a particular direction

 so this idea that there's sort of there is no ether drift it they've been incredibly

 precise with their experiments

 and they observed

 you know like by a light scattering from the cosmic microwave background an effect way

 below even what we can see today they

 would have seen an ether drift but they didn't

 and so that led to a whole world how can this possibly work there

 was a a feature of maxwell's equations for electromagnetism that implied that somehow

 the speed of light was constant independent of

 how fast things were moving

 so however fast the object y

 or whatever

 a flashlight that's you're that you're taking on a spacecraft the spacecraft is moving rapidly but yet the

 the actual

 light that comes out of the flashlight isn't

 moving relative to somebody at rest any

 faster than the speed of light it's not speed of light plus meters spacecraft

 and you would have expected from the galilean principle that you

 can't tell in your emotion you would have expected that you

 would have something where the speed of the of the photons that

 were coming out of the flashlight would be the speed of the thing that was that

 you were emitting them from plus the speed of light but that isn't

 what happened according to maxwell's equations

 okay

 so then 1905 einstein

 and then special relativity

 and special relativity was invented as this way to reconcile

 what maxwell's equations said with the lack of an ether drift and to explain

 how the speed of light can really be constant

 and what einstein realized was that well

 you can think about the speed of light being

 constant if you change your notion of what's

 how space

 and time work if you have time dilation if if if observers

 who are moving fast see

 time moving at a different rate than observers who are at rest and

 so on well actually to the observer the

 time seems to be moving at the same rate but to somebody else observing them their

 time seems to be moving at a different rate

 i mean it's a little bit spoiler alert i think we now know exactly why that happens

 and how that all works

 but that's that's

 coming when i when i get to talk about what

 we figured out about sort of a new fundamental

 theory for physics but in the time of einstein

 what einstein did was in a very kind of euclid style way was

 to sort of write down what

 essentially were axioms things like you

 know physics is independent of reference frame in for

 inertial reference frames for frames but it's kind of like newton's first law type type motion where whether

 it's just things are just moving without

 without being acted on by a force and similarly

 and things like the speed of light is constant and given these axioms

 he was able to derive in this very kind of almost greek

 type way this these

 facts about the world that were the facts of special relativity things like time dilation length contraction all

 these kinds of features of special relativity people

 were very suspicious at

 the time they said how can you be doing this this isn't like the way physics

 was supposed to be practiced it

 was a very non mathematical

 paper in many ways then

 einstein wrote a very short paper to introduce special relativity

 and people were very confused

 and it was another kind of copernicus

 like moment you know you can't believe what you think you see type thing now

 actually from special relativity came

 this notion that space

 and time is somehow the same kind of thing because in the mathematical formalism of special relativity they

 it's very clean

 personal common makovski

 um was

 kind of big on pointing this out that the equations of special relativity work

 in a really clean way

 if you

 can kind of treat space

 and time as being sort of just aspects of the same thing well

 i actually think that particular idea was a wrong turn and i think that particular idea

 kind of set back physics by

 a long time but we'll talk about that we'll

 talk about that soon this notion that

 space and time are really the same

 kind of thing i don't think it's correct

 um they appear the same kind of thing for purposes as things like special relativity

 but at a conceptual

 level they really aren't the same kind of thing and they probably don't seem to us intuitively

 like they're the same kind of thing but you

 have to kind of invent

 all these thought experiments that

 make them seem like they're the same kind of thing anyway

 so special relativity in 1905

 not a huge impact when it first came out there wasn't a lot of experimental

 measurement that could be done based on special relativity it

 was just like okay that's cool type thing so

 meanwhile a lot of other stuff was going on particularly

 stuff with radioactivity a lot of things with with that um big

 thing 1911 i think was

 the discovery of atomic nucleus

 so people

 had you know they they were beginning to think okay there are atoms they're discrete

 units of matter but you know what's you know is there something inside those atoms

 so rutherford took alpha particles helium nuclei a form of radioactivity

 and we just was just scattering them against atoms

 and discovered that most of the time you know most of an atom from most

 of the time you shoot now for particle

 and atom it just goes straight through

 but just very rarely it's it's deflected a long way and

 so rather food's interpretation of that was most of the atoms kind of just empty space but

 there's something in the middle maybe of an atom that is a hard lump a nucleus that will will

 bounce the alpha particle back and so that was the discovery of the atomic nucleus

 and soon

 it was understood that there were protons in the atomic nucleus that

 were sort of particles that were part of the that

 along with electrons formed atoms it

 was known that isotopes existed

 and it was a little bit confusing

 how that worked and it wasn't until the 1930s that separate free neutrons were observed

 i mean the the really weird thing about neutrons you know the tonic nucleus is made of protons

 and neutrons

 and in all the sort of matter that we are used to that isn't radioactive the protons

 and neutrons just sit there in the nucleus of the atom they're

 just completely stable they don't nothing happens to them

 but

 if you have a free neutron if you just manage to separate

 out just a neutron on its own the neutron undergoes radioactive decay in about 15 minutes

# Chapter 6

 and atom it just goes straight through

 but just very rarely it's it's deflected a long way and

 so rather food's interpretation of that was most of the atoms kind of just empty space but

 there's something in the middle maybe of an atom that is a hard lump a nucleus that will will

 bounce the alpha particle back and so that was the discovery of the atomic nucleus

 and soon

 it was understood that there were protons in the atomic nucleus that

 were sort of particles that were part of the that

 along with electrons formed atoms it

 was known that isotopes existed

 and it was a little bit confusing

 how that worked and it wasn't until the 1930s that separate free neutrons were observed

 i mean the the really weird thing about neutrons you know the tonic nucleus is made of protons

 and neutrons

 and in all the sort of matter that we are used to that isn't radioactive the protons

 and neutrons just sit there in the nucleus of the atom they're

 just completely stable they don't nothing happens to them

 but

 if you have a free neutron if you just manage to separate

 out just a neutron on its own the neutron undergoes radioactive decay in about 15 minutes

 so

 if you could separate out a free neutron independent

 of being bound into the nucleus of an atom it decays

 and

 and that's one of many confusing things about about

 how it all works

 but anyway so

 so a tank nucleus 1910 ish

 sort of a that was a a discovery there were another another thing that had been observed

 and was was pretty well known was this idea of spectroscopy the

 idea that when an atom absorbs light it

 absorbs it different kinds of atoms absorb

 light at different frequencies

 and when you have a

 if you

 have a prism for example you can split the light into its constituent colors different frequencies

 and you'll see that particular different

 gases for example when they're excited like in a fluorescent light

 bulb or something like that will produce characteristically

 different spectra they will have discrete lines that correspond to you

 know when you separate out the light in with a prism

 or with the diffraction grating or something they'll have discrete lines that correspond to emitting

 light of very specific frequencies

 or absorbing by two very specific frequencies

 so that was known and there was a whole sort of elaborate descriptive

 theory of spectroscopy the question is what how

 did that all work and it's sort of in the 1920s

 this all started to become clear and that

 was when quantum mechanics really emerged

 and sort of the notion of quantum mechanics was ok

 lots of things are quantized lots of things are discrete like i think 1923 the stern-gerlach

 experiment the discovery of electron spin that electrons

 can be in a sense either spinning

 up or spinning down and it's a discrete kind of thing and the

 so

 there was kind of a realization

 that these spectra these lines spectra were all associated with quantization that there

 was a discreteness to things and then

 debris in 1919 20s had this idea that maybe just like light could

 be thought of in some ways like a particle like a photon in some ways like a wave

 so maybe matter

 and things like electrons could also be thought of partly

 like a wave and partly like a like a particle

 and that was a sort of influential underlying idea that helped launch quantum mechanics

 so the real launch of quantum mechanics was probably the mention of the schrodinger equation

 and heisenberg's matrix mechanics in 1925 ish

 and

 so these were both well

 the schrodinger equation was a partial differential equation very

 much in the sort of tradition of mechanics from the 1800s heisenberg

 had a slightly more newfangled math thing that

 had to do with matrices

 matrices that were invented rather obscurely

 i mean matrices are a very simple concept but

 they've been invented in the 1800s particularly by cayley as

 a results of fairly elaborate mathematical considerations

 but anyway heisenberg applied those

 and it turned out that schrodinger

 and heisenberg view of

 how things worked were were actually equivalent although the mathematics looked fairly different and

 kind of the notion was that somehow

 everything would be discretely

 quantized a little bit like you know if you have a

 so shown are just version you know you have kind of a string

 and you

 can pluck it in the middle and it'll make you

 know a sort of single sine wave you

 can pluck it in a different way and we'll make a double sine wave triple

 sine wave but it's quantized

 they if the string is is kind of held at both ends

 they're only a limited number of configurations

 that the string can be in and that's kind of what schroder just said was happening

 for for example electrons

 and atoms that there are only a discrete set of possible configurations

 that these that these electrons can be in he described the thing that was being sort

 of that represented that configuration

 as well he called the wave function of the of the electron

 and

 so there was so

 what what chandra figured

 out was you could make these equations

 that would describe the kind of properties of the wave function

 and from those properties

 you could compute all kinds of things you could start computing atomic spectra

 you can compute the spectrum of the hydrogen atom all

 those kinds of things and it'll

 work very well you

 might ask well what was the wave function

 what did it actually mean well that

 was where things started getting a lot squiggly

 up and it was well

 the wave function is kind of related to the probability that the electron will

 be doing this thing or that thing um

 and there was a one interpretation of quantum mechanics which are emerge around the same time was

 okay just think of it as the wave function

 which is a function of complex function real

 imaginary parts that you can work out the probability when you actually say

 you want to know what happened in the atom you can

 just say i'm going to measure it and then

 what

 happened will be governed by a probability

 that is the modulus squared of the wave function

 and that was kind of the the interpretation

 that was given to

 two quantum mechanics it was like don't look under the covers too much you'll

 get confused just compute

 what happens

 and you'll get the right answer

 and that's kind of been the story of quantum mechanics from the 1920s until today it's

 like it's a mathematical theory don't

 look too closely because you'll get confused

 and my friend dick feynman always used to say you know nobody really understands quantum mechanics

 and i think that's i think that that that's been traditionally true

 exciting you know spoiler alert for the new kind of theory of fundamental physics i think we actually

 now understand quantum mechanics

 and why it works and

 how it's

 set up but that's that's

 that's for the future we're talking about history of physics today

 but in the history of physics quantum mechanics with

 very rapid developments in the 1920s by

 the end of the 1920s a

 lot of quantum mechanics was understood a lot of quantum field theory was also have been developed

 so quantum mechanics is about did

 the electron go this way or that way and there's just a particular electron

 and we're dealing with that electron

 and we're looking at it and so on when

 you want to describe things

 like an electromagnetic field you

 have to deal with the fact that well

 you don't really know how many photons are there a photon

 could be created a photon could be destroyed it's

 a little bit of a more complicated story the mathematics is considerably more complicated

 the quantum field theory as compared to quantum mechanics

 but by the late 1920s there

 was already the the the elements of quantum field theory had already been developed although the mathematics

 are working out the consequences were

 still still somewhat in the future ok

 so that was that was kind of the idea of

 oh the another important thing so the schrodinger's equation was an equation for nonrelativistic

 things

 like electrons electrons that were traveling

 at a speed very

 small compared to the speed of light um

 and

 the that was very

 soon within a couple of years after chandra's equation came out paul dirac came

 up with a thing called the dirac equation the dirac equation was an equation for a relativistic electron

 and it was a very mathematically elegant thing that dirac did

 and but it had a very weird prediction it said there in addition to there being electrons

 there should also be anti electrons particles

 just like the electron same mass same properties

 but with the negative charge from

 the electrons that the electron usually is said to have charge minus one these

 will be +1 charge

 particles with charge plus 1 called them positrons

 and positrons were the anti particles of the electron

 and the claim was that as soon as you put relativistic mechanics into

 but as you soon you tried to put relativity into quantum

 mechanics you would end up with the inevitable

 prediction of antimatter of anti particles to

 all these different kinds of particles so that was sort of a prediction a mathematical

 prediction made but basically on the basis of the aesthetics of the theory back in in the 1920s

 that there would be anti particles to the electron the proton etc etc etc

 another

 thing from around that time was howley exclusion principle this is sort of important for understanding

 well is it's a it's a thing that adds a great deal of mathematical complexity to

 quantum mechanics but it's basically the principle

 that when you have quantum mechanical things like electrons in particular you

 can't stuff too many electrons into the same state

 and that's kind of what leads to the

 fact it leads to a lot of what we see in chemistry

 is we get these kind of shells of electrons and some conceptual

 sense in different kinds of atoms because

 we can't have electrons all sort of clumping together in the same state

 and that's what leads to probably leads to many

 features of the stability of matter it's

 a very important feature of our world

 and that was something came in quite early as somewhat later it was understood that photons

 the exact opposite thing from the exclusion principle they

 like to come together and much later that led to the invention of things like lasers

 and so on um that was

 so

 um

 let's see the silicate

 so then we're continuing our sort of trip through through quantum mechanics

 and so on so 1930s well actually let me i mentioned something happened in the 1910s

 so as soon as radioactivity had been discovered

 and been discovered in things like uranium

 and

 so on there

 was the question it was a weird thing people had balloons even

 before the wright brothers did their thing there were balloons that could go out to pretty high altitudes

 and it was observed that

 if you went up to a high altitude you started seeing radioactivity just in in the air okay

 and that was the discovery you think 1912 if i remember correctly of cosmic rays that

 is that there are there is there

 as there are particles that are streaming mostly

 from the sun at least the low-energy ones come from the sun into

 the upper atmosphere of the earth and the most of them are absorbed

 by the time they reached the surface of the earth or there's still some residue on

 the surface of the earth but as you go higher up less

 of it has been absorbed and there's this cosmic radiation cosmic rays

 okay

 so cosmic rays were our best source of high-energy particles

 and so

 people did all kinds of experiments they have these emulsion stacks kind of like old-fashioned film and

 and that would work when it's like don't

 put your x-ray film through the don't

 don't put your film high-quality film

 through the x-ray scanner

 because it will get the x-rays will will you know eject

 the silver atoms in the in this in the film emulsion of its old-fashioned film well

 that was the kind of the thing

 that was done to detect particles back in the day in these for example balloon experiments

 or experiments on mountains

 and so on where people would have these emulsion stacks

 and they would look for tracks of particles going through them okay

 so that happened in the

 so people did that

 in in the 1930s in particular and

 um was it time trying to remember the

 yeah the positron

 which is the anti electron discovered in 1932 the

 and

 so that was

 so

 dirac's prediction from the mid 1920s that

 just sort of on a mathematical

 basis antimatter must exist there

 must be an antiparticle for the electron that was verified by

 actually seeing one in a cosmic ray experiment in 1932 well

 there were also a bunch of other particles that was seen in cosmic ray experiments people

 didn't know quite what they were one of my favorites 1937

 the muon the muon is just like an electron

 but 206 times heavier

 and still to this day we don't really know what muons are other

 than just the description i gave you

 um but anyway there was a kind of a zoo of particles that have been discovered

 um that were discovered starting in the 1930s through the 1940s

 and

 so on there's another thing that happened in the 1930s a chap called hideki yukawa

 tried to solve the following problem so atomic nucleus is a bunch of protons

 and neutrons all stuck together okay it was known since coulomb

 and that like

 charges like electric charges repel so

 that meant all the protons in the atomic nucleus would all want to fly apart they

 all wanted to repel each other because they all have the same charge

 so they were all you know trying to trying to sort of break up the nucleus

 so how come the nucleus stuck together well there had to be some other force

 and

 so your kawa proposed that there was another force it was a little bit like the

 force of electromagnetism but instead of being a force that was

 trans would go an infinite distance it was a limited length force that

 um would

 go only a fixed distance and he had the idea that

 that force could be associated with the exchange of a particle

 so

 by the way i should have mentioned that the photon one

 feature of the photon that became pretty quickly is that photons are massless they

 have zero mass the electron has a definite mass the proton has a definite mass the

 foe town has zero mass

 or zero

 so far as we can tell interesting question

 for my new theory whether it's really true that the elect the photon has absolutely zero mass

 that is an interesting question which i actually don't know the answer to

 but i can discuss

 how to figure that out um in any case the for

 all practical purposes the photon has zero mass if it has a mass it's really really microscopic on

 anyway the

 so

 but your car was suggested that maybe there was something that was kind of like a photon

 but there had a pretty big mass that was a mass kind

 of like maybe a tenth the mass of a proton that would

 be the the the electron as one 1800s the mass of a proton actually

 it's very light compared to a proton

 um

 so the

 that

 there would be um this other particle i'm

 not sure if he named it anyway it became called the pi on or

 the pi meson i'm

 not sure if your caller named it um

 but anyway the he suggested that there might be such a particle

 and that the exchange of those particles between protons might

 be responsible for the binding

 the strong nuclear force that bound the protons together into the atomic nucleus

 and his idea was because it's

 just a feature of quantum mechanics

 that if it was a massive particle it has finite range it can only go

 those that little exchange the process of making what are called virtual particles that

 that can sort of pop into existence

# Chapter 7

 but there had a pretty big mass that was a mass kind

 of like maybe a tenth the mass of a proton that would

 be the the the electron as one 1800s the mass of a proton actually

 it's very light compared to a proton

 um

 so the

 that

 there would be um this other particle i'm

 not sure if he named it anyway it became called the pi on or

 the pi meson i'm

 not sure if your caller named it um

 but anyway the he suggested that there might be such a particle

 and that the exchange of those particles between protons might

 be responsible for the binding

 the strong nuclear force that bound the protons together into the atomic nucleus

 and his idea was because it's

 just a feature of quantum mechanics

 that if it was a massive particle it has finite range it can only go

 those that little exchange the process of making what are called virtual particles that

 that can sort of pop into existence

 and then disappear again for a for a for a photon that can happen over a long

 distance leading to the similar square law

 but for a massive

 particle that can happen only over a short distance and the force law has to die off exponentially

 and that was your car was proposal well by the 1940s

 the pi on the carrier of the strong nuclear force had been observed

 and it was clear that that theory was correct then

 there started to be a whole zoo of other particles observed

 now you know another thing that happened late 1930s nuclear fission was discovered

 and nuclear

 fission of course led to the development of both it of the the nuclear pile for power stations

 but also to nuclear weapons

 and

 those were first tested in 1945

 and that was it became clear that um

 the

 so

 so

 that was you know the manhattan project was

 kind of a big triumph for physics in a sense it was a you

 know it was take this effect that had been predicted

 well this phenomenon of nuclear fission discovered in the late 1930s

 and packaged

 it up and actually

 make a nuclear weapon out of it in a few years and it

 was a i knew

 many of the people who were involved in that term that

 project it was a it was a very very

 remarkable kind of scientific achievement independent of what

 one can say about its military uses

 and so on as a pure matter of science it was a remarkable remarkable achievement

 and i think one of the things it did in the u.s. particularly

 was it really launched physics as being this is an important thing i

 mean it also helped that radar

 had been invented in world

 war two and that

 was another sort of physics related thing

 although it was a little bit more on the electrical engineering side

 but the manhattan project was

 really front and center this is physics this is what physics can do for you and basically

 the few billion dollars that was spent on the manhattan project sort of turned into a many

 many millions billions of dollars spent on physics research particularly in the u.s.

 after

 the second world war that i think in many ways was sort of a a thank-you

 for the for the for the success of the manhattan project that

 kind of lasted right up until the 1980s

 it kind of lasted for a whole sort of generation

 or two of physicists that

 was and that that so the manhattan project really kind of launched the interest in

 in in kind of applying

 and sort of the extreme versions of physics

 and particularly in particle physics and nuclear physics

 and so on in fact um robert

 oppenheimer the person who led the the the manhattan project

 his his sort of other interest his other big interest was in the theory of stars

 and in things about sort of extreme states of matter in stars

 and so on um the

 okay

 so so coming back to by

 the way i see people asking questions on the live stream about things like antimatter bombs

 and so on i'll probably do another one of these science q and a's for

 kids and others that's a be a great topic for for

 that but let me not to derail on that subject here

 um the

 so

 the question

 so

 it's only way one of the consequences of the manhattan project was it really launched let's study nuclear

 physics at the lowest possible level let's study particle physics let's study subatomic particles let's study

 what were then often called elementary particles that study high-energy physics it

 it launched the idea of building particle accelerators particle accelerators are big the

 kind of a big adventure and electromagnetic come you

 know they're their typical particle accelerator you've got some bunch of magnets

 and you're using those to accelerate particles along a track sometimes

 those tracks are like twenty kilometers in circumference

 and the particles go very very very fast 99.999

 percent or more of the speed of light and it's usually either electrons positrons or protons

 or anti protons that are accelerated in those things

 and they're also linear accelerators a big one of those if you drive down

 oh gosh

 what is the freeway in california

 i'm forgetting the one that's parallel for the 101 in silicon valley -

 ten - ten all right no forget anyway

 if you if you're crossover the stanford linear accelerator center this big long

 big long linear accelerator that accelerates electrons um

 and as place where a bunch of physics discoveries were made but in any case i'm the

 in a case the the the thing that

 so particle accelerators started

 sort of coming online late 1940s early 1950s lots

 of particles got discovered in particle accelerators a whole zoo of particles got discovered

 um

 and so one of the big sort of challenges was what are all these particles

 um

 and

 okay that was that was sort of one branch was

 what are all these particles what's this whole zoo of particles the other branch was let's

 take quantum field theory the thing that sort of been invented in late 1920s

 more seriously let's try in particular

 and just nail one thing the interaction of photons with electrons

 um

 and let's try and figure out what was called quantum electrodynamics

 and so in the 1940s that

 was a sort of a big thing figure out quantum electrodynamics

 um well

 a lot of things could be figured out but there was some some serious problems

 one might say the most important serious problem was that when you tried to compute things

 in quantum electrodynamics the answer you usually got was infinity usually

 you would get integrals

 which were of the form basically dx

 over x and the world integrals d k over k where k is momentum

 you would say i want to consider this sort of virtual

 particle that had a momentum that was as large as you want and when

 the momentum was sufficiently large the contribution to for example the probability that

 an electron would scatter a photon was

 proportional to this integral dk over k which which increased logarithmically as that's

 an integral where they were the answer

 if you take the upper limit to be infinity the answer is infinite

 okay

 so so

 that was kind of a big downer for quantum electrodynamics

 was the answers ended up all being infinite umm

 now meanwhile i should

 have said that two people

 had you know where there's a big wave of excitement about quantization

 everything must be quantized you know matter is quantized protons electrons spin is quantized light is quantized angular

 the all sorts of other things about some the mechanics of particles are quantized everything

 must be quantized even space people imagine mainly space is quantized well

 they didn't manage to make work that was always a something incompatible

 with with relativity to make space quantized coming

 next week you might see something different there but at

 least at that time it was spaces

 is a continuous thing not something made of discrete elements in any way

 so the

 but in a case back in the 1940s

 people tried to compute things about quantum electrodynamics big problem with infinities person

 who was a good friend of mine dick feynman one of his early contributions was

 to kind of explain away the infinities

 and be

 able to calculate even in the face of the infinities he

 never really liked what he did okay he invented this thing called realization

 and the idea was you get an infinity

 but that infinity is when you actually make a measurement on an electron

 you are really

 you're measuring but let's see if you started

 off with a bare electron

 electron didn't have any photons around it at all then you'd

 you'd say it has a certain mass for example but then you let the photons

 interact with it and so on and then you get an infinite answer for things okay fine well

 now you say well actually maybe

 i could have taken the bare mass of the electron to be minus infinity and

 so this infinite amount that

 you're adding to it that's associated with all the photons interacting

 with it it's just minus infinity plus infinity and

 it's like well we can just say the answer is the mass of the electron a little

 bit more satisfactorily

 you would say well all of this infinite stuff

 that's going on that's happening to every electron

 what we really care about is the is the difference between what

 happens to this electron

 that we poked this way and this electron we didn't poke and so we

 can just think about it as mineralization is kind of this way of saying we'll

 just look at the difference between these

 things ignoring the infinities

 and so it turned out that there were just three infinities in quantum electrodynamics and

 once you said okay we'll we'll just say

 that all those three infinities are sort of factored out then

 everything else in quantum electrodynamics was

 computable it's really computable

 i mean you can actually compute to like you know eight

 decimal digits of accuracy you can actually compute

 all of these things it's it's the most elaborate successful

 calculation in all of physics is calculations

 they used to take it used to be done with algebraic computation systems in

 the early days and they used to take years of cpu

 time and so on to

 compute that the big thing was the anomalous

 magnetic moment of the electron was

 the thing which was sort of most elaborately computed

 and you would you would be able to write down thus

 essentially power series for that in powers of the so-called fine structure constant one over hundred thirty-seven

 and you

 could the computing the coefficients

 was like this years of computer time thing and you

 could measure it and it was exactly right there's

 very impressive result of quantum electrodynamics through

 from the 1940s onwards after analyzation

 had gotten rid of the the

 kind of oh we don't know what's going on type type thing that was what happened

 so

 okay

 so that was that was quantum electrodynamics

 so another thing that came up in the 1940s was sort of a reinterpretation of quantum mechanics the

 sort of schroeder introversion the heisenberg version these were ways to compute things in quantum mechanics

 um the

 it's some

 it's

 some this thing called the path integral also

 invented by dick feynman is this way to to

 say what is quantum mechanics really well

 his version of it was that quantum mechanics quotes is something

 where you're summing over all possible

 paths you're saying this could happen in all these possible ways and it gives you essentially a prescription

 for saying the probability that the thing will happen is the sum of the paths of some

 of all possible paths with a certain weighting factor that's mathematically determined

 and by

 the way and i know i'm this is really bad i shouldn't

 be doing this it's like i i'm we

 now know why the particle works it's very exciting

 and it has a very beautiful correspondence

 to the way things work and grab it in the theory of gravity

 but any case that's some see

 i'm i'm actually very

 poor at being patient and doing

 these things but i want to get it so that i've actually got sort of more

 or less the full story ready to say and that will happen next week but any case the

 coming back to

 what happened

 so quantum field theory quantum electrodynamics great successes 1940s through 1960s meanwhile

 1950s to early 1960s

 this whole zoo of particles being discovered they have all kinds of exotic names you

 know the the well they were the mesons the baryons the hyper owns the they

 have all kinds of names i when

 i was a kid i used to

 really be into particle

 physics and i could tell you they probably recite

 the the names you know there were the pi ons there were the kaos

 there was the eight a particle those amazon's

 there was the there

 were things like go there was the 5s

 on the f mazon then

 there were the baryons the the lambda

 hyper on the sigma hyper ons that i'm

 drawing them in a picture

 because they usually arranged

 that these some theory of lee groups gives us a way to sort

 of have this way of arranging these particles in these definite configuration

 anyway lots and lots of particles discovered

 so the point where there were hundreds of these things knowing

 and the question was

 what

 um

 you know what what are you know

 what are all these particles you

 know how can we explain them you know we this was supposed to be elementary particles

 the world was supposed to be made of these things but

 now we've got hundreds of them this is not you

 know the world is made of something simple

 okay

 so there were two basic theories that developed the the first theory

 which came out of a thing called s matrix theory

 and another thing that sort of came out of a quantum field theory tradition

 so the the s matrix idea

 which kind of emerged all that first was the following idea

 so it was like like

 just think about particles

 colliding with each other and just say when

 particles collide you can describe the probabilities of those collisions

 and then you will write down essentially mathematical relations between different particle collision probabilities

 and that was packaged up in a thing called the s matrix and there

 were properties of the s matrix the s matrix was a function of many complex variables

 it had all kinds of elaborate kind of consistency

 conditions about the s matrix

 and the idea of s matrix theory was it just said look don't

 worry how it actually works inside just

 know that there are these constraints

 on the s matrix and try and compute what must happen and from

 that came this thing called the bootstrap hypothesis for particles

 which

 was the idea that no particle is really any more elementary

 than any other all

 these particles just sort of emerge as

 some sort of consistency condition from each other

 okay

 so that was theory number one okay

 theory number two which

 emerged in 1964 ish particularly

 another friend of mine named murray gell-mann um was

 responsible for this one together

 with person called george reich who is also a good friend of mine i'm the

 was this idea of of quarks

 so

 the idea of course was maybe

 these particles like protons aren't actually elementary maybe

 inside a proton there are actually in the case of a proton three quarks

 and originally

 marika man kind of invented that idea a little bit like the way that you know dalton

 had done the atomic theory of just sort of counting things and looking at how

 what constituents

 would have to exist just to make the numbers work out although

 murray sort of packaged that in a somewhat more elaborate theory of li algebras

 and li groups theory of sort of fancy mathematics of symmetries

 but in case what it really came down to was you just count if

# Chapter 8

 okay

 so that was theory number one okay

 theory number two which

 emerged in 1964 ish particularly

 another friend of mine named murray gell-mann um was

 responsible for this one together

 with person called george reich who is also a good friend of mine i'm the

 was this idea of of quarks

 so

 the idea of course was maybe

 these particles like protons aren't actually elementary maybe

 inside a proton there are actually in the case of a proton three quarks

 and originally

 marika man kind of invented that idea a little bit like the way that you know dalton

 had done the atomic theory of just sort of counting things and looking at how

 what constituents

 would have to exist just to make the numbers work out although

 murray sort of packaged that in a somewhat more elaborate theory of li algebras

 and li groups theory of sort of fancy mathematics of symmetries

 but in case what it really came down to was you just count if

 there are quarks they have to have these properties

 and then you could make three quarks would make a proton

 a quark and an antiquark would make a pi on there

 will be three kinds of quarks

 and up down a strange they were originally called pn

 and lambda

 but but in modern times they called up down and strange

 um the in a case the the that was the idea that inside

 the proton that we'd be three quarks now

 there was a problem there

 because it was like well why don't we seek walks out

 and out in the wild well

 there would have to be some mechanism that would confine the quarks unlike

 an atomic nucleus which could undergo fission

 and

 where the pieces of the nucleus the neutrons

 and things like that would just sort of you know you know come out that

 couldn't be the case with quarks because what seemed like we didn't see any free quarks

 so that was kind of a weird feature of that theory

 okay

 so then that

 was quark theory versus the of

 the the s-matrix theory it seemed like the s-matrix theory was winning in the 1960s

 it really seemed like it was winning

 um actually one of the things that got made from from that s-matrix

 theory was a very elaborate piece of mathematics that

 was string theory well at least it was the first version of string theory it

 was a theory of strong

 interactions that was sort of mathematically derived from the whole s-matrix setup

 okay

 so by the late 1960s

 something that was being done was the thing called deep inelastic scattering

 so just like rutherford discovered the nucleus by

 bouncing by by shooting alpha particles at um at atoms

 and noticing

 that most of the time i just went

 through but some of the times they got bounced back so

 um

 a particular person called hofstadter father

 of douglas hofstadter um was was one of the main people who was involved in

 and there was several other people involved in that um involved

 particularly at slac actually the stanford linear accelerator center the thing that

 you can see from the freeway whose name i've now forgotten um the

 that's

 gonna drive me crazy that i can't remember

 that but anyway maybe somebody

 can put it on the live stream i'm the

 in any case the

 so

 same idea

 but for protons instead of for for atoms shoot high-energy electrons at protons

 and see what happens

 so what happened in most of the time the electron would go straight through but some

 of the time it would bounce back

 and

 so that meant that there was some kind of hard bit inside

 the proton well at least that was one interpretation of what was observed in deep inelastic scattering

 so

 um

 the that was

 well

 actually dick feynman was involved in in inventing

 this thing these things he called part ons which

 was supposed to be the parts of protons well it became clear

 that basically

 that it looked like part ons might be quacks it

 looked like in these experiments one might be seeing some sort of constituents

 inside inside protons um ok

 they've been another development in the 1950s a thing called the yang-mills theory was

 invented yang-mills theory was a generalization of the theory of electromagnetism

 but electromagnetism can

 be thought of as

 a so-called gauge theory a theory

 that's associated with a local symmetry a local

 and it's associated with a local symmetry group there's just rotations around a circle

 so yang

 and mills had

 this idea well maybe there's a generalization of that that

 involves not just the symmetry of going around a circle

 but a cemetery that would be for example essentially of going anywhere

 around a sphere or something like this or or some slight generalizations of that um

 and

 so they invented this thing they called yang-mills theory it was a pure sort of it

 was a pure sort of theoretical idea

 and maybe they thought it might be related to the strongly perforce

 some way but they didn't quite know how ok

 so that led in

 to

 that that theory

 so

 called non abelian gauge theories led to well

 actually led to two things i i'm getting them see

 this is now that

 this history gets more complicated for me because we're head hitting the part of this history

 where i was actually involved in certain ways so um

 by the time i got involved in particle physics around 1974

 um

 and

 so it's always

 it's always the worst is always

 remembering the history that involved

 that that one was involved in but any case the

 okay another little sideshow here

 oh yeah 280 that's that that's the freeway that that

 i was forgetting that's

 the one that crosses over the stefan

 area accelerators hunter i'm the

 in any case the

 okay

 so so back to this i'm i'm gonna try

 and i don't have too much more to talk about but

 but i was gonna try

 and get us up to modern times

 um and then

 yeah

 okay

 um

 okay

 we're

 still in the 1950s we're talking about some yang-mills

 theory i'm gonna mention one more thing that happened

 okay

 so

 when atomic nuclei decay in radioactivity there are three forms of radioactivity that were embedded were identified

 pretty early alpha beta and gamma decay they're

 all their mechanisms are completely different alpha

 decay is just like throwing out a piece of helium nucleus

 and beta

 decay is an interesting one beta decay involves the emission of an electron or

 positron from a nucleus

 and that is a form of the way in which it decays

 and

 many

 famous things like carbon-14 decays that way a lot lots of things decay that way so the

 beta

 decay not really well understood i

 talked about the strong nuclear force beta

 decay was often said to be associated with the weak nuclear force

 okay

 well the people didn't know that much about the weak nuclear force but one thing that was

 observed in beta decay in 1957 i think was a very weird phenomenon called parity violation

 okay

 so when

 you think about the laws of physics there are certain invariances

 that are usually true like for example we

 don't imagine that if we

 if we just turned

 something turn some physical system upside down ignore gravity we

 turn it upside down we'd

 think it still worked the same way the laws of physics will be the same if we turn

 the thing upside

 down you might also think the laws of physics will be the same if we reflect the

 whole thing in a mirror we

 would still it wouldn't be that it will be the case that just

 as something could happen this way if we reflect in a mirror it could

 happen the way we would see in the reflection in the mirror

 okay well that's all very well

 and good except

 that it turned out that that mirror reflection symmetry didn't apply to nuclear beta decay

 and it was discovered in 1957 that basically the that

 you could have an asymmetry

 in nature in the emission of in the in the angular distribution of electrons in the decay of

 of nuclei

 there was this thing called parity violation the violation of

 invariants under

 under just sort of mirror reflection of everything

 much later it was realized

 so another feature of beta decay was that it seemed like something weird was happening

 because there was a question of how momentum was conserved because electrons would come out and

 it was like they would shoot off in some direction

 but the nucleus wouldn't recoil the way you would expect from a momentum conservation and

 so then pauli suggested the idea that maybe there was an unseen particle

 and neutrino he called it and that was a particle

 that wasn't detected that was in neutral electrically neutral particle

 you couldn't see with a particle detector was going off the opposite direction from the electron

 and turned

 out the the the main result actually is that neutrinos are always left-handed there's you you well with

 a slight exception about neutrino oscillations

 but let's not worry about that for the most part neutrinos are always left-handed

 and that's why this that's a way of understanding this parity violation phenomenon

 you don't find equal numbers of left and right-handed neutrinos you only find left-handed neutrinos

 and so that's the so that was the sort of explanation

 which became clear only a number of years later for

 parity violation but anyway that was a phenomenon discovered 1957

 discovery of sort of features of the weak nuclear force there

 was kind of a question of how did the weak nuclear force relate to other

 things we knew like electromagnetism feature of the weak nuclear force it's really weak compared to electromagnetism

 it has a really short range

 so strong

 and close force has certain range weak nuclear force has a much smaller range weakly

 a force in some sense has a range that is about

 2,000 times smaller than the range of the strong nuclear force it

 wasn't known how that worked was suggested 1967

 or so byam

 steve weinberg

 and abdus salam that

 that there was kind of a possible theory of the weak nuclear force

 and a way to sort of unify it with electromagnetism

 and in in kind of a tradition of we don't have enough particles yet typed thing they they're

 what came out of that was the idea that there were yet more particles just

 like there were photons that were carriers of electromagnetism there

 would also be w bosons

 and z bosons that will be carriers of the weak nuclear force

 but they would have a very high mass which would

 lead to this short range for the weak nuclear force

 okay

 so that was that was something that emerged that was a that

 was an example of a local gauge theory

 it was a local gauge theory based on the group su 2 cross u 1

 okay

 so then in the in the by the early 70s this idea of local

 gauge theories was like all the rage and there was another local gauge theory

 that was suggested for the strong nuclear force

 and su3 local gauge theory in

 which the carriers of that force will be things that got called gluons like

 quarks they would be confined inside the proton

 but they would be another thing it

 was kind of like a photon

 except not really like a photon

 except they were massless except unlike photons

 which don't interact with each other directly gluons

 would have a an interaction glue on to glue on interaction

 so

 okay so that was all sort of a nice mathematical thing

 but honestly people didn't really believe people believed the s-matrix theory of strong interactions

 was the way it went until 1973 1973

 a phenomenon called asymptotic freedom was discovered

 the

 and

 this was came out of a kind of mathematical development

 called the renormalization group that

 had been part of that had been sort of an offshoot of the renovation idea

 but basically what was discovered was that

 if you kind of looked at a strong interaction

 if you looked at one of these gluon interactions at

 a very short range if you were like the

 way that things working in quantum mechanics through the uncertainty principle is short

 distance is kind of equivalent to high energy or high momentum transfer

 so

 if you kick something a lot it's like probing it at a very short distance so

 what

 what this said was this asymptotic freedom idea said one could do a calculation

 which showed that if you kick things really hard in this

 su3 gauge theory that was called qcd quantum chromodynamics

 um that

 that it would be the case that

 um that the um

 the quarks

 and the gluons would behave

 as if they were almost free particles

 as if they didn't really have this very tight binding

 the strong nuclear force associated with them um

 and

 so that was kind of so that was kind of a theoretical idea

 but it became clear that these deep inelastic scattering experiments

 have pretty much seen this phenomenon they'd

 seen the idea that when you kick the thing hard enough it behaves

 like it's a very free

 particle that can just bounce around anyway at once rather

 than being this this tightly confined thing

 that can't do much so

 that was in 1973 sort of big transition in physics the

 realization quantum field theory is it you know we can compute things with quantum field theory

 and there was a huge

 sort of i was

 involved in particle physics at that time there was sort of a huge

 rush of excitement about

 what one could do in in physics using

 the ideas of quantum field theory actually it was really fueled in 1974 by

 the fact that there was two very surprising discoveries one was electrons

 and positrons annihilated other they turned into two photons

 or into other kinds of things the

 when you sort of crashed them into each other at high high energy it

 turned out the probability that they would annihilate went

 up in a way that people didn't expect and then

 i think was in november 1974 i think of the japes aught jpi particle was discovered

 it was a new particle that had

 a mass of 3 point 1 gev about

 3 times the mass of the proton

 and nobody really expected it would be that big surprise

 so

 that was that was sort of the the the beginning

 of the sort of supercharging of particle physics which kind of lost it through the 1970s

 and people like me i was 14 years old at the time kind of got excited about

 what was this particle can we explain

 what was going on etc etc etc um turned

 out that particle was actually evidence of a new kind of so-called charm quark

 and that was sort of an unexpected discovery in physics

 and that really made it clear that this whole gauge theory kind of quantum

 field theory thing that was really it that was kind of really

 the thing that was working

 so that kind of fueled

 a lot of work another

 sort of unexpected discovery

 was made in 1977

 the thing called the b quark was discovered also

 a thing called the tau leptin

 which was i mentioned the muon

 which is kind of like just like the electron

 but 206 times heavier there's also the tau leptin

 which is just like the the muon

 but gosh it has a mass of about 1.7

 gev i'd

 have to do the math which i can't immediately do in my head but it's about

 um it's about

 it's about

 thousands of to thousand times three thousand times heavier than me i'm than the electron

 um anyway

 so those things were all discovered the the other big thing that happened

 okay i'm leaving out the thing

# Chapter 9

 the thing that was working

 so that kind of fueled

 a lot of work another

 sort of unexpected discovery

 was made in 1977

 the thing called the b quark was discovered also

 a thing called the tau leptin

 which was i mentioned the muon

 which is kind of like just like the electron

 but 206 times heavier there's also the tau leptin

 which is just like the the muon

 but gosh it has a mass of about 1.7

 gev i'd

 have to do the math which i can't immediately do in my head but it's about

 um it's about

 it's about

 thousands of to thousand times three thousand times heavier than me i'm than the electron

 um anyway

 so those things were all discovered the the other big thing that happened

 okay i'm leaving out the thing

 called spontaneously broken gauge theory so one of the issues have been renormalization important

 idea let you calculate things in quantum electrodynamics question

 was were these other gauge theories including these ones that involved things like the w

 and z particles that were very high mass particles

 or even just electrons that had nonzero mass were these things also realisable

 and in the simplest way of setting things up they were not realizable

 you couldn't i mentioned

 that in qed in quantum electrodynamics there

 were just these three infinities

 that showed up in these other theories you'd

 compute something you get an infinity you compute something else you get another infinity

 you just kept on getting new infinities

 and that meant really couldn't predict anything you didn't have a finite number of infinities that

 you had to just sort of get rid of um the

 so in any case then

 it was some when was that that must have been early 70s

 it was it

 was realized that through

 the higgs mechanism for generating mass you would be able to get massive particles

 without breaking realisability

 and it was proved that in fact these theories were renormalizable

 the higgs particle was kind of this weird way this

 weird thing that i always thought was a total cluj

 and i was pretty disappointed when the hid particle was actually discovered in what 2015

 or so

 because

 i'd really thought this cluj cannot possibly actually be right anyway

 it was it's a way of of understanding

 how mass arises for particles like electrons and

 so on and kind of the idea is well

 the particle doesn't really have a mass but throughout the universe we're back to ether again throughout

 the universe there's

 this higgs field that sort of is

 spread throughout the universe and as the electron goes through this higgs field it's effectively a generating

 a mass and again

 there is no ether

 but there is an ether but

 and the ether is now the a recent

 version of the ether is the field i'm any case the

 okay

 so well that was so particle physics you know lots of good things happened by

 the late 1970s there was this idea maybe

 it will be possible to unify the strong interactions that weak interaction electromagnetism everything bundled together into

 a grand unified theory

 and that grand unified theory we i mentioned these gauge

 groups the grand unified theory might have a group that was like su v a bigger group by

 these other groups will be subgroups

 and somehow there will be particles with masses of 10 to the 15 gev

 and so on that would be associated

 with this bigger gauge group and so on everything would be great one

 prediction the prediction was the proton will decay with

 a lifetime of 10 to the 30th years

 um

 okay

 so people busily around 1980 were

 looking for proton decay because it was a prediction of these grand unified theories

 and they

 didn't find it no proton decay has ever been observed so

 far as people know protons are completely stable particles

 so that was a big downer and that kind of the energy of looking

 at some kind of grand unified theories decayed

 meanwhile experiments

 were going on you know tens of billions of dollars were being spent on particle accelerators

 particularly at fermilab in the us and at cern and geneva switzerland

 and

 1984 the w and z particles were duly discovered actually

 after

 the the b quark was discovered

 it was known that there also had to be a bottom

 quark there was also t quark a top quark that must exist that

 was discovered in 1995 actually

 i had figured out with

 a prison called david poet sir back in the late 1970s that

 there was an upper limit on the

 masses that courts could possibly have if the universe wasn't going to become unstable and we

 believed the universe isn't unstable

 right now and the the top quark actually comes pretty close to our upper bound on how massive

 a court could possibly be anyway

 so those were discovered in 2000 i guess it's

 2012 maybe the the higgs particle

 which

 was something what was predicted from this whole higgs mechanism that

 was discovered as well there emerged this kind of standard model of particle physics

 which allowed you to compute things and everybody just kind of the

 everybody just was able to go ahead and

 compute a lot of things in particle physics in it it became sort of a thing

 where one didn't really have to when didn't really think about the fundamentals

 of what was going on almost more just thinking about the the computing

 of things i noticed on live stream with question how can there three different infinities

 the point is that the the mathematical

 formulas that generate those infinities is slightly different and the issue is they are all related to different

 physical properties of electrons that one is right of the mass of the electron one

 is related to a coupling of the electron to the photon

 and

 what's the other one self energy the vertex

 king polarization

 yeah the the other one is associated with the propensity of a photon to turn into a virtual

 electron-positron pair

 and those are just the three independent differently

 computed kinds of infinities in quantum electrodynamics z 1 z 2 z 3 usually they're called

 um

 okay well

 so particle physics kind of hit the 1980s

 and sort of the standard model got established

 and it was all just calculation from then on out in a first approximation so

 particle physics kind of put it on a shelf more

 or less done in some sense with the slight footnote

 oh grand unified theories hadn't worked out

 okay there's another branch i'm gonna try

 and go fairly quickly on this um the another

 branch of the story of physics is gravity

 so

 gravity had a much

 so newton had this idea this universal law of gravitation 1687

 inverse square law pretty much nothing happened in gravity until 1915

 and in 1915 einstein had this idea of general relativity

 and his idea was let's try

 and he what he wanted to do is to generalize the sort of logical deductive

 ideas of special relativity was sort of an axiom it ization of physics implying things to

 deal with the general features of space

 and gravity and

 so he had this thing called the principle of equivalence that

 was sort of a thing that was another principle it said that the you

 can't kind of tell the difference between acceleration

 and being in a gravitational field those are those are sort of two things that seem

 the same if you just look at mechanical properties of what's going on

 so anyway he

 invented this idea he used kind of very highfalutin mathematics of the time differential geometry and

 theory of things like riemann tensors

 and so on he

 always used to say and i i actually in my own efforts in fundamental

 physics now i i now deeply sympathize with what he said he

 he would always tell people people would say you using this all this elaborate mathematics

 you must be very good at mathematics

 and he would say you

 know look this mathematics is kind of the outer limit of what i understand

 but i happen to be able to apply it to physics

 and then physics i've been doing recently there's wonderful

 and beautiful mathematics that applies and i i i feel very barbaric in

 my uses of it because i'm sure there's there's a much more elegant version

 of it that will eventually be discovered

 but i'm using it in a barbaric way as i

 think einstein felt that he was using differential

 geometry in a sort of barbaric way but nevertheless it worked and the

 main thing that einstein did was to show that that

 you could think about gravity

 as corresponding to curvature in space-time so you know when you shine

 a laser beam it'll

 go in a straight line what is a straight line mean well

 a straight line if you think that space is curved a straight

 line would be something

 just like a straight line going on a sphere is curved a straight

 line could be something that deviates

 and so

 what einstein suggested

 and his einstein equations is that matter mass

 causes

 deformation in space-time causes

 space-time to be curved and that means that what you thought was a straight line isn't

 what

 you would otherwise consider

 a straight line and so that accounts for the fact that for example if you you

 know if you something

 that would otherwise be moving in a in a sort of newton's first law a straight line if there's

 a piece of the massive object space-time is curved around that massive object

 and so the thing really is moving in a straight line

 but it's moving the straight line in curved space-time and that causes it to to

 deviate its trajectory in just the way that gravity says it should evie ate the trajectory

 so general relativity had a prediction it said that the deflection

 of light around the sun will be twice as great as will be expected from other theories

 essentially there was a form of gravitational magnetism a gravitational log of magnetism that

 essentially doubled the effect of gravity on on a photon going around the sun and then

 in 1919 there was sort of a big excitement

 it's not completely clear how genuine

 this experiment was but big sort of excitement of going to observe a total solar eclipse

 and discovering that einstein was actually correct that term that there was twice the deflection

 so general activity had its first big test and it worked just fine

 okay general somebody is a very mathematically complicated theory

 and it

 was very hard to work out its consequences already it was known by 1916

 a guy called karl schwarzschild had had

 worked out a solution stein stein's equations they corresponded to a spherical object like a star

 and the gravity associated with that and that solution

 had a prediction it said that there would be four in certain cases an event horizon

 but it was completely not understood

 what that meant at that time it was some see these equations are complicated

 and there's a question of of the event horizon was sort of a similarity in the equations

 and that the thing is that it's easy to get singularities

 and equations for example let's say using latitude

 and longitude to describe a position on the earth if you use latitude

 and longitude

 what happens at the north pole you have kind of a weird singularity of of the of the longitude

 at the north pole because that the actual north pole is sort of all the longitudes

 are are stuck together

 but that's just a mathematical singularity

 it's not a genuine

 feature it's not like there's something weird at

 the north pole of the earth with

 respect to it's just that that's a matter of our description

 so

 the thing that term so anyway general relativity developed quite slowly

 um one of the things in general activity that einstein had the most simple-minded

 version of einstein's equations implied

 something that einstein thought was completely on sense it implied that the universe expands

 so einstein put in this thing called the cosmological term

 which was intended to compensate for

 what would otherwise be a necessary expansion of the universe we're all needless to say in 1929

 a guy called hubble observed that the universe is expanding einstein

 always said that that was sort of the biggest mistake of his physics life was the cosmological term

 because it didn't

 need to be there because actually the universe is expanding and really his equations

 if he'd really trusted them predicted

 that the universe should expand anyway hubble observed that galaxies were receding and

 actually la mettrie had already proposed

 what is now called the big bang theory that the universe started as something small and

 and progressively has expanded

 okay well meanwhile by the 1940s

 people like oppenheimer actually will looking at sort of what would happen when stars collapsed

 and it was slowly

 becoming clear that black holes were a thing it

 wasn't clear whether black holes will sort of have this singularities

 associated with them they have this event horizon actually laplace in the 1700s

 had already thought about what

 if the escape velocity of a thing is more than the speed of light does

 that mean that light couldn't escape from it well

 that was what was happening in these equations in

 what einstein's equations predicted

 but people weren't sure was that a coordinate singularity was just a piece of mathematics

 or was it something real

 but it became more

 and more clear that there would really be this this phenomenon

 there should be this phenomenon sufficiently

 massive stars when they collapse should

 undergo gravitational collapse and form these event horizons

 where light couldn't escape from them

 so

 that was sort of a feature of of generality that generality in a sense describes its own failure

 because it says that at the very center

 of it like a schwarzschild black hole there's a singularity in space-time

 and that means that the equations by their nature can't describe that singularity

 so it's kind of explaining its own its own limitation

 but nevertheless it was there was a lot of mathematical complexity around that well

 meanwhile the the notion of the big bang and the expansion of the universe been developed some 1940s

 people were talking about that and so on people didn't know whether it was really real 1964

 some guys at bell labs were trying to do satellite communications

 and they observed that there was this this irreducible background radiation whichever

 way they pointed their antennas

 and it was then realized gosh that's just a relic of the big

 bang that's a relic of the

 essentially the photons that have been created in the very early universe had

 now been sort of red

 shifted they'd now been cooled down to the point where they were this very low-energy

 2.7 degrees above absolute zero

 radiation

 that was in all directions in the universe so that was kind of evidence 1964

 really evidence for the big bang theory of the universe

 it hadn't been clear whether that theory was correct or whether there was a steady state theory

 that was really correct

 where you know the universe was just steadily producing new galaxies

 popping up in different places by

 the way one thing that was also a confusion

 that lasted a long time was

 the question of antimatter

 and where was the antimatter in the universe because

 the the most obvious theories the big bang would produce equal amounts of matter and antimatter it

 was discovered in 1964 a thing called cp violation

 also

 related to time reversal violation it's

 a phenomenon whereby there's sort of a difference between particles

 most things about particles

 and antiparticles the same but some particles

 and antiparticles have a strain have some strange small differences particularly

 the neutral k on so the original example

 um

 but

 in any case there was still this mystery

 and when i was a kid still a big mystery

 why is there more matter you

 know why don't we see a bunch of you

 know could there be antimatter galaxies

 could the andromeda galaxy be made of antimatter we didn't know actually

 why is there more matter you

 know why don't we see a bunch of you

 know could there be antimatter galaxies

 could the andromeda galaxy be made of antimatter we didn't know actually

 i some of my early science

 had to do with trying to figure out what what the consequences of antimatter galaxies would be and

 and things about separation between matter and antimatter in the universe and

 so on actually in the 1919

 late 1970s i worked on using cp violation to understand

 what i think is now the generally accepted theory

 for why there isn't as much antimatter

 as matter in the universe that there

 was cp violation in the early universe that

 caused a small difference

 between the amounts of matter and antimatter and all the stuff that wasn't different annihilated

 away but we got left with a small residue one part one hundred million basically

 but is everything we know that's

 the matter in the universe so that's that's one kind of weird

 feature by the way they the one thing about antimatter is antimatter

 still falls doesn't have negative mass still

 has positive mass i now understand why that's true but tim that was that was originally

 kind of just a fact from quantum quantum mechanics any

 case back to general tivity

 so

 what happened in relativity was some sort of progressive measurements

 things got more accurate you know the of very nice experiments done on the effect of gravitational

 redshift all kinds of other things predictions of general relativity binary

 pulsars neutron stars orbiting each other

 emitting gravitational waves just like you can emit electromagnetic waves when you have moving moving electric charges

 so you can mit emit gravitational waves when you have moving

 moving masses that was a prediction of einstein's general relativity

 and

 so

 that was the that was kind of that

 was there was i was in direct observation of gravitational waves through

 these binary pulsars things like that you know generalist everything was working great theory

 from 1915 no changes working great and in

 fact to this day it's worked great and the big thing in one was it 2015

 discovery of gravitational waves by ligo was

 this is the merger of two black holes causing

 a very violent thing

 where about two

 times the mass of the sun is dissipated in energy in a matter of a second about

 a third of the way across the universe

 and that produced this intense pulse of gravitational waves that

 was detected by gravitational waves deform space-time

 and so

 what ligo does is it basically is looking at the length of a big thing

 and it's basically

 saying if there's a defamation in space-time like a wave comes through space-time

 the length will change just a little tiny bit a tiny fraction

 of the distance across an atom the length will change to

 represent the passage of the gravitational wave more or less and

 and that was observed in 2015 a fantastic

 um that validation of general relativity and of the existence of black holes

 okay

 so the one thing that

 you know it's like the

 one kind of big flag that something doesn't really quite work in physics is the

 fact that this whole structure of quantum field theory is completely

 inconsistent with the theory of gravity so

 the the problem is you

 try and make a quantum theory of gravity the most obvious way to do it is replace

 photons by gravitons

 and stir

 the pot so to speak well if you do that you

 get a theory that isn't realizable

 and this big mess so

 people starting in the 1980s really

 got excited about doing quantum gravity finding

 a way to merge kind of quantum field theory and gravity

 and there were these different schemes things like super gravity schemes

 that said let's add more particles well those particles weren't observed other

 kinds of schemes for merging gravity

 and and and quantum mechanics another thing that emerged was a retooling

 of string theory string theory were originally invented as a well ultimately unsuccessful

 theory of strong interactions

 but it was sort of re retooled

 and put to work as a theory that would unify quantum

 field theory and gravity a sort of a consistency

 condition of string theory is is general relativity etc

 etc etc it had some weird predictions like the universe is really 26 dimensional

 but most of those dimensions are rolled up in little tiny balls and so on kind

 of weird things that to many people

 might be kind of a sign there might be something

 unconvincing about this theory

 but people didn't have much choice so physics

 community kind of barreled right along and a lot of physicists started working on string theory um

 and and there were some excitements in the mid 1990s there was a thing called m-theory

 which would sort of emerge from some sophisticated theory for whatever it's done in physics

 and whatever it will do in physics it is spun off a lot of very nice mathematics

 and the sort of merger of mathematics with physics that

 has been associated with it is really very powerful i

 mean i might say that in the physics

 that i've been doing recently i think that

 string theory it's mathematics is quite relevant although its underlying structure

 is not the same but you know string theory has been re

 sort of recast once before i think it can happen again

 and still leave the same string theory structure intact

 so to speak but the thing that that happened in

 so quantum gravity big thing in the 1980s 1990s

 and

 so on one piece of that had been

 1974 stephen hawking worked

 out this idea of hawking radiation which was sort of a a a rather rickety

 kind of calculation of sort of a merger of quantum field theory of

 what happens to quantum field theory near a black hole and the basic

 answer is you can have situations

 where virtual particle pairs are made particle-antiparticle

 pairs are made one of the pair falls into the black hole and the other one is emitted

 to infinity

 and that leads to a black hole not really being black

 but emitting radiation hawking radiation hasn't been observed yet

 but it's some it has it's a great theoretical interest

 and actually i think we have some very interesting new things to say about it

 but in any case that led to a bunch of a bunch of kind of theories

 around

 kind of thinking of black holes so black holes even

 though they're big you

 know kilometers across and so on or whatever it is or even bigger than that

 um they are in a sense very perfect there's

 you know if you have a black hole it

 sort of doesn't have any hair there's a no-hair theorem for black holes actually but

 but it's basically like all you

 have to know about a black hole is its mass how

 fast it's spinning and maybe it's electric charge and

 and everything else it's like a particle really

 but it's just a great big particle

 and

 so

 that idea of a black hole is just like a particle is

 something that has sort of wound its way into theories of sort of attempting to merge quantum mechanics

 and gravity particularly

 from the late 1990s a thing called the a dsc ft correspondence it's a correspondence

 between anti-de sitter space

 which is a version of the solution to einstein's equations

 and i think called conformal field theory

 which is kind of a limiting case of quantum field theory

 and there's a very beautiful mathematical

 correspondence between these things which i think actually is

 a precursor of something that we now understand much better um

 but that has to do with the merger of relativity

 and quantum mechanics

 but anyway i think we're pretty much from

 well that's that's kind of a well

 i've been talking there about fundamental

 physics in another there

 are two big branches i haven't talked about maybe another time i'll talk about these -

 condensed matter physics things

 like theory of superconductivity and

 so on that

 was a field that really really started to engage you

 know really impressively in the 1980s

 um

 and

 the other big thing i haven't talked about is quantum computing that's

 something i actually worked on that with dick feynman actually back in around 1981 not too

 long before people had mostly heard of quantum computing

 but that's a that's a thing that's sort of a way of taking the formalism of quantum mechanics

 and trying to apply it to computing

 they'll probably more to say about that i talked about fundamental

 theory of physics um

 and there's

 things that um that

 we can probably say now about quantum computing all right i'll take there is some quick come

 quick come

 [music]

 questions here i haven't been paying attention [music]

 all right well there seems to be enthusiasm for you know i think

 what we've discovered is

 um

 it's kind of a it's something i started working on thirty years ago and and for

 a variety of reasons stopped

 and stopped

 and then finally last

 fall i kind of had a little bit of a breakthrough that i made and then i started

 working with a couple other people very

 energetically on this and it's spectacular

 and i think you know these things

 which kind of i've known about for

 what

 kind of close to 50 years now about physics that always seemed a bit mysterious i

 think we really understand

 how they work and it's really

 really cool and i can't wait to talk about it and we'll have a bunch of material ready

 sometime next week and

 i'll be doing some live streams

 i'll be doing

 live streams kind of explaining the main point it's

 the main point is not that trivial to explain

 i mean not super surprising that

 if you have a fundamental theory of the universe it's

 not like a one line thing to explain

 how it all works but then i'll be doing some more technical q&a a physicists

 and mathematicians

 and computer scientists later on

 and no it's not a cellular automaton

 if you if you want to know what it's like go

 read go look at chapter 9 of my book a new kind of science

 which you can find online that's

 really the that's the that's the precursor to what term to what i'm talking about

 okay well

 um all right

 we should play wrap up here i went on a lot longer than i expected i guess there's

 more in the history of physics that i then

 i thought i remembered um

 but

 thanks for thanks for joining me and i look forward to saying

 more about the future of physics

 next week so thanks a lot bye
