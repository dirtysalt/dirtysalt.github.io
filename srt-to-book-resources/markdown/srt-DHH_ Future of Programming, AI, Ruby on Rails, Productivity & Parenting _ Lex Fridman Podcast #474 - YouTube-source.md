# Chapter 1

- No one anywhere who's serious believes

that cookie banners does anything good for anyone,

yet we've been unable to get rid of it.

This is the thing that really gets me

about cookie banners too.

It's not just the EU.

It's the entire world.

You can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet.

If you go to goddam Mars on one of Elon's rockets

and you try to access a webpage,

you'll still see a cookie banner.

No one in the universe is safe from this nonsense.

It sometimes feels like we're barely better off.

Like webpages aren't that different

from what they were in the late '90s, early 2000s.

They're still just forms.

They still just right to databases.

A lot of people, I think, are very uncomfortable

with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys.

They just make systems

that create read, update or delete row in a database,

and they have to compensate

for that existential dread by overcomplicating things.

That's a huge part of the satisfaction

of driving a race car

is driving in at the edge of adhesion, as we call it.

Where you're essentially

just a tiny movement away from spinning out.

Doesn't take much,

then the car starts rotating.

Once it starts rotating,

you lose grip and you're going for the wall.

That balance of danger and skill

is what's so intoxicating.

- The following is a conversation

with David Heinemeier Hansson, also known as DHH.

He is a legend in the programming and tech world,

brilliant and insightful, sometimes controversial,

and always fun to talk to.

He's the creator of Ruby on Rails,

which is an influential web development framework

behind many websites used by millions of people,

including Shopify, GitHub, and Airbnb.

He is the co-owner and CTO

of 37signals that created Basecamp, HEY and ONCE.

He is a "New York Times" bestselling author,

together with his co-author,

Jason Fried of four books,

"Rework," "Remote," "Getting Real,"

and "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work."

And on top of that, he's also a race car driver,

including being a class winner

at the legendary 24-hour Le Mans Race.

And now, dear friends, here's DHH.

For someone who became a legendary programmer,

you officially got into programming late in life,

and I guess that's because you tried

to learn how to program a few times and you failed.

So can you tell me the the full story, the saga

of your failures to learn programming?

Was Commodore 64 involved?

- Commodore 64 was the inspiration.

I really wanted a Commodore 64.

That was the first computer I ever sat down in front.

And the way I sat down in front of it

was I was five years old

and there was this one kid on my street

who had a Commodore 64.

No one else had a computer,

so we were all the kids just getting over there

and we were all playing "Yie Ar Kung-Fu."

I dunno if you've ever seen that game.

It was one of the original fighting games.

It's really a great game.

And I was playing that for the first time

at five years old.

And we were like seven kids

sitting up in this one kid's bedroom,

all taking our turn to play the game.

And I just found that unbelievably interesting.

And I begged and I begged and I begged my dad,

could I get a computer?

And he finally comes home.

He's like, "I got your computer."

I was like, yes, my own Commodore 64.

And he pulls out this black green and blue keyboard.

That's an Amstrad 464.

I was like, dad, what's this?

- The disappointment.

- This is not a Commodore 64.

But it was a computer.

So I got my first computer at essentially six years old

that Amstrad 464.

And of course, the first thing I wanted to do,

I wanted to play video games.

And I think the computer, which he by the way,

had traded for TV and a stereo recorder

or something like that.

Came with like two games.

One was this "Frogger" game

where you had to escape from underground.

It was actually kind of dark.

Like this frog, you're trying

to get it out from underground.

And I was pretty bad at it.

And I only had those two games.

And then I wanted more games.

And one way to get more games

when you're a kid who don't have a lot of money,

I can't just buy a bunch of games,

is to type them in yourself.

Back in '84, '85,

magazines would literally print source code

at the back of their magazines

and you could just sit and type it in. So I tried to do that

and it would take like two hours

to print this game into the Amstrad.

And of course I'd make some spelling mistake along the way

and something wouldn't work,

and the whole thing.

I wasn't that good of English.

I was born in Denmark.

So I was really trying to get into it

because I wanted all these games.

I didn't have the money to buy 'em.

And I tried quite hard for quite a while to get into it,

but it just never clicked.

And then I discovered the magic of piracy.

And after that I kind of basically just took some time off

from learning to program

because, well, now suddenly

I had access to all sorts of games.

So that was the first attempt,

like around six, seven years old.

And what's funny is I remember these fragments.

I remember not understanding the purpose of a variable.

If there's a thing and you sign something,

why would you assign another thing to it?

So for some reason, I understand it constants.

A constants made sense to me, but variables didn't.

Then maybe I'm 11 to 12,

I've gotten into the Amiga at this point.

The Amiga, by the way,

still perhaps my favorite computer of all time.

I mean, this is one of those things

where you're like, people get older and they're like,

"Oh, the music from the '80s amazing."

To me, even as someone who loves computers,

who loved new computers,

the Amiga was this magical machine

that was made by the same company

that produced the Commodore 64.

And I got the Amiga 500, I think in '87.

- Look at this sexy thing

that is a sexy machine right there.

- This is from an age by the way,

where computing wasn't global in the same sense.

The different territories

had different computers that were popular.

The Amiga was really popular in Europe,

but it wasn't very popular at all in the US

as far as I understand it. It wasn't popular in Japan.

There were just different machines.

The Apple II was a big thing in the US.

I'd never even heard of Apple

in the '80s in Copenhagen.

But the Amiga 500 was the machine

that brought me to want to try it again.

And you know what's funny?

The reason I wanted to try it again

was I remembered the first time to learn.

And then there was this programming language

that was literally called EasyAMOS,

like the easy version of AMOS.

I'm like, if it's EasyAMOS, how hard can it be?

I gotta be able to figure this out.

And this time I tried harder.

I got into conditionals,

I got into loops, I got into all these things

and I still, I couldn't do it.

And on the second attempt,

I really got to the point of like,

maybe I'm not smart enough,

maybe programming is just not for me,

maybe it's too much math.

Like I like math in this sort of superficial way.

I don't like it in the deep way.

That's some on my perhaps slightly nerdier friends did

who I had tremendous respect for.

Like I'm not that person.

I'm not the math geek who's gonna figure it all out.

So after that attempt with EasyAMOS

and failing to even get, I don't even think

I completed one even very basic game.

I thought the program's just not for me.

I'm gonna have to do something else.

I still love computers.

I still love video games.

I actually at that time had already begun making friends

with people who knew how to program,

who weren't even programming EasyAMOS.

They were programming freaking assembler.

And I would sit down and just go, how do you,

the moves and the memories and the copies,

how do you even do this?

I don't even understand how you go from this

to Amiga demos, for example.

That was the big thing with the Amiga.

It had this wonderful demo scene in Europe.

It's this really interesting period of time

in Amiga's history

where you had all these programmers

spread out mostly all over Europe

who would compete on graphic competitions,

where you could probably bring

one of these different... - On that thing?

- On this thing,

they would make these little almost like music videos,

combining some midi music, combining some cool graphics.

And they would do all of it in like 4K, four kilobytes.

That is not 4Ks of revolution,

four kilobytes of memory.

And I just thought that was such a cool scene.

This was obviously pre-internet.

It was even pre BBS, bulletin board systems

to some extent.

It was you swap your demo software with someone else

by sending them a disk in the mail, like the 3.5s.

And I was enamored with that whole scene.

I was enamored with what they were able to create

and I just wanted to be a part of it

even though I kind of didn't have any skills to contribute.

And that's how I got into running BBSs.

I didn't learn programming then

and I wouldn't learn programming until much later,

until I was almost 20 years old.

The bulletin board systems existed in this funny space

where they were partly a service to the demo scenes

allowing all these demo groups

to distribute their amazing demos.

And then it was also a place

to trade piracy software, pirated software.

And I ended up starting one of those

when I was 14 years old

in my tiny little bedroom in Copenhagen.

I had my, at that point, Amiga 4000.

I had three telephone lines coming in into my tiny room.

- [Lex] Nice.

- Which is funny because again, I'm 14 years old.

By the time I was in Sterling, my third line,

you had to get someone from the telephone company

to come do it.

I get this guy and he's just looking around like,

"What is this?

Why the hell is a 14-year-old

having three phone lines into their tiny little bedroom?

What's going on here?

Why are all these modems blinking red and black

and making funny sounds?"

- Did your parents know?

- They did and they didn't.

They knew I had the phone lines.

They knew I had the computer.

I don't think they really understood

that I was trading pirated software

that was both illegal, and whatever else was going on.

- Oh, we should probably say that in Europe,

maybe you can comment on this

in, especially in Eastern Europe, but Europe in general,

piracy I think was more acceptable

than it was in the United States.

I don't know there maybe it's just my upbringing.

- Even that conversation wasn't present.

I never spoke to anyone growing up in Denmark.

- The piracy is wrong. - Had any moral qualms

whatsoever about piracy.

It was just completely accepted that you're a kid,

you won a lot of games.

You don't have a lot of money, what do you do?

You trade. - Yeah.

- Some people would occasionally buy a game.

I mean, I once bought a second Master System,

and I bought one game.

Because that was what I could afford.

I got "After Burner II."

I dunno if you've ever played that game.

It's pretty bad implementation

on the second Master System,

but it was like 600 crowners.

And I was making money at that time

doing newspaper delivery.

I had to do that for a month to afford one game.

I like video games way too much

to wait a month just to get one game.

So piracy was just the way you did it.

And that was how I got into running

this bulletin board system,

being part of the demo scene,

being part of the piracy scene to some extent.

And then also at some point realizing,

oh, you can actually also make money on this

and this can fund buying more phone lines

and buying more modems and buying more Amigas.

Oh yeah, that was one of the demo parties.

These were amazing things.

- What am I looking at? - Isn't that amazing?

- Look at all those CRT monitors.

- All these CRT monitors.

Again, when I was 14,

I don't understand fully why my parents allowed this.

But I traveled from Copenhagen,

the capital of Denmark to Aarhus this tiny little town

in Jutland on the train with a bunch of dudes

who were like late teens and their 20s.

I'm 14 years old.

I'm lugging my 14-inch CRT monitor

with my computer in the back to go to the party.

That was what it was called.

That was the biggest demo scene party at that time.

And it was exactly as you see in that picture,

thousands of people just lining up with their computers,

programming demos all day long,

and trading these things back and forth.

- That's kind of awesome.

Not gonna lie.

It's a little ridiculous.

- It's totally awesome.

And I miss it in ways

where the internet has connected people in some ways,

but the connection you get from sitting

right next to someone else

who has their own CRT monitor

who's lugged at halfway around the country to get there

is truly special.

Because it was also just this burst of creativity.

You're constantly running around.

You're constantly surrounded by people

who are really good at what they could do.

They're really good at programming computers.

It's infectious.

It was part of that pang I felt then going like,

oh man, why can't I figure this out?

I mean, why can't I even figure out EasyAMOS?

It's kind of frustrating.

- But on your third attempt,

you a little more successful?

- So third attempt is when I start getting it,

this is when I start helping out,

let's say build things for the internet.

So around '95, I think it is, or '96,

I discovered the internet.

Actually, in ninth grade.

That was my first experience.

I went to some university in Denmark.

And in ninth grade, we had this excursion

and they sat us down in front of a computer

and the computer had Netscape Navigator, the first version,

or maybe it was even the precursor to that.

And they had a text editor.

And us kids just got like,

"Hey, built something on the internet."

And it was just HTML and the first thing you do is like,

oh, I can make the text blink

by just putting in this tag and saving it.

That moment, that was actually when I reawaken the urge

to wanna learn the program

because I got a positive experience.

All the other experiences I had with programming

was I'd spend hours typing something in,

I'd click Run and it wouldn't work.

And I'd get an error message

that made no sense to me as a kid,

either at six or seven or at 12.

And here I am sitting in front of a computer

connected to the internet and I'm making text blink.

I'm making it larger.

I'm turning it into an h1 or an h2.

And these guys out here,

"We just did it for like an hour and a half."

And suddenly I go, oh, I can make things for the internet

that someone in Germany can be able to access and see,

and I don't have to ask anyone for permission.

This is super cool.

# Chapter 2

by just putting in this tag and saving it.

That moment, that was actually when I reawaken the urge

to wanna learn the program

because I got a positive experience.

All the other experiences I had with programming

was I'd spend hours typing something in,

I'd click Run and it wouldn't work.

And I'd get an error message

that made no sense to me as a kid,

either at six or seven or at 12.

And here I am sitting in front of a computer

connected to the internet and I'm making text blink.

I'm making it larger.

I'm turning it into an h1 or an h2.

And these guys out here,

"We just did it for like an hour and a half."

And suddenly I go, oh, I can make things for the internet

that someone in Germany can be able to access and see,

and I don't have to ask anyone for permission.

This is super cool.

I gotta do more of this.

So I got into to the internet.

I got into working with HTML

and I still had all these friends from these demo parties.

And I started working with them

on creating gaming websites.

I'd rather buy the video games, I'd review him.

This was another good way of getting new video games

was to walk down to some store

and say like, hey, I'm a journalist.

I'm like this 15-year-old kid.

And they're looking at you, "You're a journalist?"

Yeah, can I borrow some games?

Because this was when games moved on

to the PlayStation and these other things.

You couldn't just as easily pirate, at least not at first.

So I went down there, did all that,

and that started the journey of the internet for me.

It started working on these gaming websites,

working with programmers,

figuring out that I could do something,

I could work on the HTML part. It's not really programming,

but it kind of smells like it.

You're talking to a computer.

You're making it put text on the screen

and you're communicating

with someone halfway around the world.

So that became my pathway back into programming.

And then slowly I picked up more and more of it.

First website I did with someone,

one of these programs from the demo scene

that was dynamic was ASP.NET.

I wasn't even actually called .NET.

That was what we started on.

And then we moved on to PHP,

and PHP was when I finally got it.

When it finally clicked.

When conditionals and loops and variables

and all of that stuff started to make sense enough to me

that I thought I can do this.

- So would it be fair to say

that we wouldn't have DHH without PHP,

and therefore you owe all of your success to PHP?

- 100% that's true.

And it's even better than that

because as PHP to me didn't just give a start

in terms of making my own web applications,

it actually gave me a bar.

In many ways, I think the pinnacle of developer,

web developer ergonomics is late '90s PHP,

you write this script,

you FTP it to a server and instantly it's deployed.

Instantly it's available.

You change anything in that file and you reload.

Boom, it's right there.

There's no web servers, there's no setup.

There's just an Apache that runs mod PHP.

And it was essentially the easiest way

to get a dynamic webpage up and going.

And this is one of the things I've been chasing that high

for basically the rest of my career.

That it was so easy to make things for the internet

in the mid to late '90s.

How did we lose the sensibilities

that allowed us to not just work this way

but get new people into the industry

to give them that was success experiences that I had.

Adding a freaking blink tag to an HTML page,

FTPing a PHP page to an Apache web server

without knowing really anything about anything,

without knowing anything about frameworks,

without knowing anything about setup.

All of that stuff have really taken us to a place

where it sometimes feels like we're barely better off.

Like webpages aren't that different

from what they were in the late '90s, early 2000s.

They're still just forms.

They still just write to databases.

A lot of people, I think are very uncomfortable

with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys.

They just make systems

that create read, update or delete row in a database,

and they have to compensate

for that existential dread by overcomplicating things.

Now that's a bit of a character.

There's more to it.

And there's things you can learn

from more sophisticated ways of thinking about this.

But there's still an ideal here,

which is why I was so happy you had Pieter Levels on,

because he still basically works like this.

And I look at that and go like,

man, that's amazing.

- Yeah, you're chasing that high.

He's been high all along

using PHP, jQuery and SQLite.

- I think it's amazing because he's proving

that this isn't just a nostalgic dream.

He's actually doing it.

He's running all these businesses.

Now some of that is, as he would admit up first upfront,

is that he's just one guy.

And you could do different things when you just one guy.

When you're working in a team,

when I started working on the team,

when I started working with Jason Fried on Basecamp,

we at first didn't use version control together.

I used version control for myself.

And then I thought, do you know what?

Designers, ah, they probably not smart enough

to figure out CBS.

And therefore I just like, no, no, no, you just FTP it up.

You just FTP it.

I knew they knew how to do FTP.

And then after the third time

I had overridden their changes.

I was like, goddammit.

I gotta teach Jason CBS to not do that again.

But I think there's still way more truth

to the fact that we can work the way we did in the '90s,

work the way Pieter works today, even in the team context.

And that we've been far too willing

to hand over far too much of our developer ergonomics

to the merchants of complexity.

- And you've been chasing that with Rails 8.

So how do you bring all the cool features

of a modern framework and make it no build,

make it as easy to create something

and to ship it as it was in the '90s with just PHP?

It's very difficult for me

to beat the Pieter Levels approach.

It's so easy to just ship some PHP.

- And it should be.

Why should it be harder than that?

Our computers today are almost infinitely faster

than what they were in the '90s.

So shouldn't we be able to work in even easier ways?

We should be looking back on the '90s ago,

like, oh, that was way too complicated.

Now we have more sophisticated technology

that's way faster and it allows us to work

in these easier to use ways.

But that's not true.

But now you can see the line I draw

in my work with Ruby on Rails,

and especially with Rails 8.

No build to me is reaching back to that '90s feeling

and going, now we can do

some of those things without giving up

on all the progress.

Because I do think you can get too nostalgic.

I do think you can start just fantasizing

that everything was better in the '90s.

It wasn't.

I mean, I was there.

There was a lot of things that sucked.

And if we can somehow find a way to combine

the advantages and advances we've had over the past 20 years

with that ease of developer ergonomics, we can win.

No build is a rejection of the part of web development

I've hated the most in the past 10, 15 years,

which is the JavaScript scene.

And I don't say that as someone who hate JavaScript.

I mean, I often joke that JavaScript.

It's my second favorite program language.

It's a very distant second.

Ruby is by far and away number one,

but I actually like JavaScript.

I don't think it's a bad language.

It gets a lot of flack.

People add a string of two plus a one

and it gives something nonsense.

And I just go like, yeah,

but why would you do that?

Just don't do that.

The language is actually quite lovely,

especially the modern version.

ES6 that really introduced a proper class syntax to it.

So I could work with JavaScript in many of the same ways

that I love working with Ruby made things so much better.

But in the early 2010s until quite recently,

all of that advancement happened in pre-processing,

happened in built pipelines.

The browsers couldn't speak a dialect of JavaScript

that was pleasant to work with.

So everyone started to pre-filing their JavaScript

to be able to use more modern ways of programming

with a browser that was seen as stuck

with an ancient version of JavaScript

that no one actually wanted to work with.

And that made sense to me,

but it was also deeply unpleasant.

And I remember thinking during that time,

the dark ages, as I refer to them with JavaScript,

that this cannot be the final destination.

There's no way that we have managed

to turn the internet into such an unpleasant place to work.

Where I would start working on a project in JavaScript

using webpack and all of these dependencies.

And I would put it down for literally five minutes

and the thing wouldn't compile anymore.

The amount of churn that the JavaScript community,

especially with its frameworks

and its tooling went through

in the decade from 2010 to 2020 was absurd.

And you had to be trapped inside of that asylum

to not realize what an utterly perverse situation

we had landed ourselves in.

Why does everything break all the time?

I mean, the joke

wouldn't be just that the software would break,

that would annoy me personally.

But then I'd go on Hacker News

and I'd see some thread

on the latest JavaScript release of some framework.

And the thread would be like, someone would ask,

"Well, aren't we using the thing

we just used three months ago?"

And people would be like, "That thing is so outdated.

That's so three months ago.

You gotta get with the new program.

We're completely rewriting everything

for the oomph-teen time."

And anything you've learned in the framework

you've been spending the last amount of time on,

it's all useless.

You gotta throw everything out and you gotta start over.

Why aren't you doing it, stupid idiot?

- Is that a kind of mass hysteria

that took over the developer community you think?

Like where you have to keep creating new frameworks

and new frameworks.

And are we past that dark age?

- I think we're getting out of it,

and we're getting out of it

because browsers have gotten so much better.

There was a stagnation in browser technology.

Some of it was an overhang all the way back from IE5.

So IE5 essentially put the whole internet development

experience into a deep freeze,

because Microsoft won the browser wars in the mid 2000s,

and then they basically disbanded

their browser development team.

'Cause they're like, "All right, job done.

We don't need any more innovation on the internet.

Can we just go back to writing Windows forms

or something now that we control everything?"

And it really wasn't until obviously Firefox

kind of kindled a little bit of something.

Then Chrome got into the scene

and Google got serious about moving to web forward.

That you had a kindling

of maybe the browser could be better.

Maybe the browser wasn't frozen in time in 2005.

Maybe the browser could actually evolve

like at the development platform that it is.

But then what happened was you had a lot of smart people

who poured in to the web

because the web turned out to be the greatest

application development platform of all time.

This was where all the money was being made.

This was where all the billionaires were being minted.

This was where the Facebooks

and whatever of the world came to be.

So you had all of this brain power

applied to the problem of how to work with the web.

And there were some very smart people

with some, I'm sure very good ideas

who did not have programmer happiness

as their motivation number one.

They had other priorities

and those priorities allowed them to discount

and even rationalize the complexity

they were injecting everywhere.

Some of that complexity

came from organizational structure.

When you have a company like Facebook, for example,

that does depend on the web and wanna push it forward,

but have sliced the development role job

into these tiny little niches.

I'm a front-end glob pipeline configurator.

Oh yeah, well, I'm a front-end whatever engineer.

And suddenly the web developer was no longer one person.

It was 15 different roles.

That in itself injected a ton of complexity.

But I also wanna give it the bold case here,

which was that some of that complexity

was necessary to get to where we are today.

That the complexity was a bridge.

It wasn't the destination,

but we had to cross that bridge

to get to where we are today,

where browsers are frankly incredible.

The JavaScript you can write in a text file

and then serve on a web server

for a browser to ingest is amazing.

It's actually a really good experience.

You don't need any pre-processing.

You could just write text files,

send them to a browser,

and you have an incredible development.

- And we should also say that it can kind of be broken,

at least the HTML, but even the JavaScript

could be a little bit broken and it kind of still works

like maybe a half-ass works.

But like, just the amount of mess of smelly code

that a browser has to deal with is insane.

- This is one of the hardest problems in computing today

is to parse the entire internet.

Because thankfully for us as web developers,

but perhaps not so much for the browser developers,

every webpage that has ever been created

minus the brief period with Flash still runs today.

The webpage I did in ninth grade would render

on a modern browser today,

30 years later. - That's crazy.

- That is completely crazy.

When you think about the amount of evolution

we've had with the web, how much better we've made it,

how many more standards browsers have adopted.

It's essentially an Apollo project today

to create a new browser,

which is why it doesn't happen very often,

which is why even companies like Microsoft

had to throw into towel and say, "We can't do it."

Now I actually don't think that's good for the web.

There is the danger of the monoculture

if we just get a single browser engine

that runs everything,

and we are in danger of that.

I love the fact that the Ladybird project, for example,

is trying to make a new browser engine from scratch.

I've supported that project.

I would encourage people to look into that.

It's really a wonderful

- Nice. - thing.

It's staffed by a bunch of people

who worked on other browser projects in the past.

- Truly independent web browser.

- We really need that.

But I can hold that thought in my head.

At the same time, I hold the thought in my head

that Google's Chrome was pivotal

to the web surviving

as the premier web development platform.

If it had not been for Google and their entire business

depending on a thriving open web,

Apple, Microsoft, I think would've been just as fine

to see the web go away to disappear

into being something that's just served

native web applications or native mobile applications

and native desktop applications

that they could completely control.

So I have all sorts of problems with Google,

but it's not Chrome.

Chrome is a complete gift to web developers everywhere,

to the web as a development platform.

And they deserve an enormous amount of credit,

I think for that.

Even if it's entangled with their business model

and half of Chrome is code that spies on you

# Chapter 3

At the same time, I hold the thought in my head

that Google's Chrome was pivotal

to the web surviving

as the premier web development platform.

If it had not been for Google and their entire business

depending on a thriving open web,

Apple, Microsoft, I think would've been just as fine

to see the web go away to disappear

into being something that's just served

native web applications or native mobile applications

and native desktop applications

that they could completely control.

So I have all sorts of problems with Google,

but it's not Chrome.

Chrome is a complete gift to web developers everywhere,

to the web as a development platform.

And they deserve an enormous amount of credit,

I think for that.

Even if it's entangled with their business model

and half of Chrome is code that spies on you

or informs targeted ads.

And a bunch of things, I'm not a big fan of.

I can divorce that from the fact

that we need champions in the corner of the web

who have trillions of dollars of market cap value

riding on the open web.

- We're gonna take tangents

upon a tangents upon a tangents.

So let's go to Chrome.

I think Chrome positive impact on humanities

is immeasurable for reasons that you just described.

On the technology front,

the features that present the competition they created,

it's spurred on this wonderful flourishing

of web technologies.

But anyway, I have to ask you about

the recent stuff with the DOJ,

trying to split up Chrome and Google.

Do you think this is a good idea?

Do you think this does harm?

- It's a disaster.

And I say that as someone who's been very sympathetic

to the antitrust fight, because I do think

we have antitrust problems in technology.

But the one place where we don't have them, by and large,

is with browsers,

is with the tools we use to access the open web.

First of all, we have Firefox.

Now Firefox is not doing all that great.

And Firefox has been propped up by Google for many years

to deter from exactly what's going on with the DOJ

that they were the only game in town.

Apple has Safari.

I have a bunch of problems with Apple too,

but I love Safari.

I love the fact that we have a premier browser

running on a premier operating system

that people can't turn the web

into just a Chrome experience.

But I also think that the open web

needs this trillion dollar champion,

or at least benefits from it.

Maybe it doesn't need it,

but it certainly benefits from it.

And of all the things

that are wrong with monopoly formation in technology,

Chrome is the last thing.

And this is why I get so frustrated sometimes

about the anti or the monopoly fight

that there are real problems.

And we should be focusing on the premier problems first.

Like the toll booths on our mobile phones.

They're far bigger problems.

It's not the open web.

It's not the tools that we use to access the open web.

If I don't want to use Chrome,

if my customers of my businesses that run on the internet

don't wanna use Chrome, they don't have to.

We're never forced to go through it.

The open internet is still open.

So I think it's a real shame that the DOJ

has chosen to pursue Google in this way.

I do think there are other things you can nail Google for

and their ad monopoly maybe,

or the shenanigans done

in controlling both sides of the ad ledger

that they both controlled the supply and the demand.

There are problems.

Chrome, isn't it?

And you end up making the web much worse.

And this is the thing we always gotta remember

when we think about legislation,

when we think about monopoly fights

is you may not like how things look today.

And you may wanna do something about it,

but you may also make it worse.

The good intentions behind the GDPR in Europe

currently has amounted to what?

Cookie banners that everyone on the internet hates.

That helps no one do anything better,

anything more efficient that saves no privacy

in any way, shape or form

has been a complete boondoggle

that has only enriched lawyers

and accountants and bureaucrats.

- Yeah, you said that the cookie banner is a monument

for why Europe is losing is doing the worst

of all the regions in tech.

- It's a monument to good intentions

leading straight to hell.

And the Europe is actually world class

in good intentions leading straight to hell.

- So hell is the cookie accept button

that you have to accept all cookies.

That's what hell looks like over and over.

You don't actually ever get to the web page.

- Just on a human scale,

try to imagine how many hours every day are wasted

clicking that away.

And how much harm we've done to the web as a platform

that people enjoy because of them.

The internet is ugly in part because of cookie banners.

Cookie banners were supposed to save us from advertisement,

and advertisement can make the web ugly.

There's plenty of examples of that,

but cookie banners made the entire internet ugly

in one felt swoop.

And that's a complete tragedy.

But what's even worse,

and this is why I call it out as a monument

to everything the EU gets wrong,

is that we have known this for a decade.

No one anywhere who's serious believes that cookie banners

does anything good for anyone.

Yet we've been unable to get rid of it.

There's this one piece of legislation

that's now I think 10 or 12 years old.

It's complete failure on every conceivable metric.

Everyone hates it universally,

yet we can't seem to do anything about it.

That's a bankruptcy declaration for any body of bureaucrats

who pretend or pretend

to make things better for not just citizens,

but people around the world.

This is the thing that really gets me

about cookie banners too.

It's not just the EU.

It's the entire world.

You can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet.

If you go to goddamn Mars on one of Elon's rockets

and you try to access a webpage,

you still see a cookie banner.

No one in the universe is safe from this nonsense.

- Probably the interface

on the rocket. - It'll be slower.

You'll have basically 150 second ping time.

So it'll take you 45 seconds

just to get through the cookie banners from Mars.

- All right, let's walk back up the stack

of this recursive tangents we've been taking.

So Chrome, we should say,

at least in my opinion, is not winning unfairly.

It's winning in the fairway by just being better.

- It is, if I was gonna steal man the other side

just for a half second,

people would say, well, maybe yes,

most people do sort of begrudgingly agree

that is a pretty good browser.

But then they'll say the reason it

got dominance was distribution.

And the reason it got distribution

was because Google also controls Android,

and therefore can make Chrome the default

browser on all these phones.

Now I don't buy that.

And the reason I don't buy that

is because on Android, you are actually allowed

to ship a different browser

that has a browser engine that's not the same as Chrome.

Unlike on iOS, where if you wanna ship a browser,

Chrome, for example, ships for iOS,

but it's not Chrome, it's Safari wrapped in a dress.

And every single alternative browser on iOS

have to use the Safari web engine.

That's not competition.

That's not what happened on Android.

Again, I think there are some nuances to it,

but if you zoom out

and you look at all the problems

we have with big tech, Chrome is not it.

Chrome won on merits.

I begrudgingly have switched to Chrome

on that realization alone.

As a web developer, I just prefer it.

I like Firefox in many ways.

I like the ethos of it,

but Chrome is a better browser than Firefox full stop.

- And by the way, we've never mentioned Edge.

Edge is also a good browser

- Because it's also Chrome in a dress.

- But it never gets to love.

I don't think I've ever used Bing,

and I'm sure Bing is really nice.

- Maybe you have, because you know what?

Is Bing in a dress?

- What? - DuckDuckGo.

Which is actually - What?

- the search engine that I use.

DuckDuckGo gets its search results from Bing,

or at least it used to.

If they change that, that would be news to me.

- Well, maybe everything

is just a wrap or a dress.

Everything is wearing a dress underneath.

There's some other. - There's some of that.

- Turtles, all the dress is all the way down.

Okay, what were we talking about?

They, we got there from JavaScript

and from you learning how to program.

So eventually, the big success story

is when you built a bunch of stuff with PHP

and you were like actually shipping things.

And that's when the Ruby story came.

So what your big love affair

with programming began there?

So can you take me there?

What is Ruby?

Tell the story of Ruby.

Explain Ruby to me.

- PHP was what converted me

from just being able to fondle HTML

and turn out some web pages

to actually being able to produce web applications myself.

So I owe a tremendous gratitude to PHP in that regard.

But I never thought of PHP as a calling.

I never thought, I'm a professional programmer

who writes PHP, that's who I am

and that's what I do.

I thought of PHP as a tool

I needed to smack the computer with

until it produced web applications I wanted.

It was very much a means to an end.

I didn't fall in love with PHP.

I'm very grateful that it taught me

the basics of programming.

And I'm very grateful that it set the bar for the economics.

But it really wasn't until Ruby

that I started thinking of myself as a programmer.

And the way that came about

was that the first time I ever got hired

as a professional programmer to write code

was actually by Jason Fried, my business partner still.

All the way back in 2001,

I had been working on these gaming websites in PHP

for essentially 18 months at that point.

No one had been paying me to do code in that regard.

And I connect with Jason Fried

over an email sent from Copenhagen, Denmark

to Chicago, Illinois to a person who didn't know who I was.

I was just offering solicited advice.

Jason had asked a question on the internet

and I had sent him the answer and he was asking in PHP.

And I'd sent him the answer to that question.

And we started talking and then we started working.

Which by the way, is a miracle

of what the internet can allow.

How can a kid in Copenhagen

who's never met this guy in Chicago

connect just over email and start working together?

And by the way, we're still working together now

24 years later.

That's incredible.

But we started working together

and we started working together on some client projects.

Jason would do the design, 37signals would do design,

I would bring the programming PHP.

And after we'd work on I think two or three

client projects together in PHP,

we kept hitting the same problem.

That whenever you work with a client,

you start that project off an email.

Oh yeah, let's work together.

Here's what we're building.

And you start trading more and more emails.

And before a few weeks have passed,

you gotta add someone to the project.

They don't have the emails.

They don't have the context.

You send it, where's the latest file?

Oh, I've uploaded on the FTP.

It's like finalfinal_v06_2.0, right?

That's the one to get.

It's just a mess.

A beautiful mess in some ways,

a mess that still runs the vast majority of projects

to this day.

Email is the lowest common denominator.

That's wonderful.

But we had dropped the ball a couple of times

in serious ways with customers

and we thought we can do better.

We know how to make web applications.

Can't we just make a system

that's better than email for managing projects?

It can't be that hard.

We've been doing blogs.

We've been doing to-do lists.

Let's put some of these together

and just make a system

where everything that anyone involved in the project needs

is on one page.

And it has to be simple enough

that I'm not gonna run a seminar

teaching you how to use the system.

I'm just gonna give you the login code.

You're gonna jump into it.

So that's Basecamp.

And when we started working on Basecamp,

I for the first time in the experience I had with Jason

had the freedom of technology choice.

There was no client telling me,

"Yeah, PHP, that sounds good.

We know PHP.

Can you build it in PHP?"

I had free reigns.

And at that time I'd been reading IEEE magazine

and a couple of other magazines back from the early 2000s

where Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler

had been writing about programming patterns

and how to write better code.

And these two guys, in particular,

were both using Ruby to explain their concepts

because Ruby looked like pseudo code.

Whether you were programming in C or Java or PHP,

all three constituencies could understand Ruby

because it basically just read link English.

So these guys were using Ruby to describe the concepts.

And first of all, I would read these articles

for just the concepts they were explaining.

And I'd be like, what is this programming language?

I mean, I like the concept you're explaining,

but I also wanna see the programming language.

Why haven't I heard of this?

So I started looking into Ruby

and I realized at that time,

Ruby might not be known by anyone,

but it's actually been around for a long time.

Matz, the Japanese creator of Ruby

had started working on Ruby back in '93.

Before the internet was even a thing.

And here I am in 2003, 10 years later,

picking up what seems like this hidden gem

that's just laying in obscurity in plain sight.

But Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler,

I think successfully put me and a handful of other people

on the trail of a programming language

that hadn't been used much in the west, but could be.

So I picked up Ruby and I thought,

this is very different.

First of all, where are all the semicolons?

I'd been programming in PHP, in ASP,

I'd even done some Pascal, I'd looked at some C.

There were semicolons everywhere.

And that was the first thing that struck me

is where are the damn semicolons?

And I started thinking,

actually, why do we have semicolons in programming?

They're to tell the interpreter

that there's a new line of instructions,

but I don't need 'em as a human.

How? Oh,

someone is looking out for the human here,

not for the machine.

So that really got me interested.

And then I thought to myself, do you know what?

I know PHP quite well.

I'm not an amazing programmer.

I haven't been working in programming for all that long,

but maybe I can figure it out.

I'm gonna give myself two weeks.

I'm gonna write a proof of concept

where I talk to a database,

I pull some records, I format them a bit,

and I display 'em on an HTML page.

Can I figure that out in a couple weeks?

It took about one weekend

and I was completely mesmerized.

I was completely mind blown

# Chapter 4

that there's a new line of instructions,

but I don't need 'em as a human.

How? Oh,

someone is looking out for the human here,

not for the machine.

So that really got me interested.

And then I thought to myself, do you know what?

I know PHP quite well.

I'm not an amazing programmer.

I haven't been working in programming for all that long,

but maybe I can figure it out.

I'm gonna give myself two weeks.

I'm gonna write a proof of concept

where I talk to a database,

I pull some records, I format them a bit,

and I display 'em on an HTML page.

Can I figure that out in a couple weeks?

It took about one weekend

and I was completely mesmerized.

I was completely mind blown

because Ruby was made for my brain

like a perfect tailored glove by someone I'd never met.

Like, how is this even possible?

- We should say maybe like paint the picture

of the certain qualities that Ruby has,

maybe even compared to PHP.

We should also say that there's a ridiculous thing

that I'm used to that I forget about

that there's dollar signs everywhere.

PHP. - Yes, yes,

there's line noise.

That's what I like to call. - There's line noise.

Line noise, that's such a beautiful phrase.

Yeah, so there's all these things

that look like programs.

And with Ruby,

I mean there's some similarities in Python there.

It just looks kind of like natural language.

You can read it normally.

- Here's a wild loop that does a five iterations.

You can literally type

the number five, dot,

now I'm calling a method under number five.

By the way, that's one of the beautiful aspects of Ruby

that primitives like integers are also objects.

And you can call 5.times, start brackets.

Now you're iterating over

the code in that bracket five times, that's it.

- [Lex] Okay, that's nice.

- That's not just nice, that's exceptional.

There's literally no other programming language

that I know of that has managed to boil away the line noise

that almost every other programming language would inject

into a five time iteration

over a block of code to that extent.

- Wow, that's a really nice,

well, thank you for giving that example.

That's a beautiful example.

Wow, I don't think I know

what programming language that does that.

That's really nice.

- Ruby is full of that.

So let me dive into a couple of examples.

Because I really think it helps paint the picture.

And let me preface this by saying I actually,

I like the ethos of Python.

I think the Ruby and the Python community

share a lot of similarities.

They're both dynamic interpreted languages.

They're both focused on immediacy and productivity

and ease of use in a bunch of ways.

But then they're also very different in many other ways.

And one of the one ways

they're very different is aesthetically.

Python, to me, I hope I don't offend people too much.

I've said this before, it's ugly.

And it's ugly in its space,

because it's full of superfluous instructions

that are necessary for legacy reasons

of when Guido made Python back in '87

that are still here in 2025.

And my brain can't cope with that.

Let me give you a basic example.

When you make a class in Python,

the initialize a method, the starting method is def.

Okay, fair enough.

That's actually the same as Ruby,

D-E-F, definition of a method.

Then it is underscore, not one,

underscore, two, init, underscore, underscore,

parentheses start, self, comma,

and then the first argument.

- [Lex] Yeah, the whole self thing.

- I look at that and go, I'm sorry I'm out.

I can't do it.

It's everything about it

offends my sensibilities to the core.

Here you have the most important method

that all new objects or classes have to implement.

And it is one of the most aesthetically offensive ways

of typing initialized that I've ever seen anywhere.

And you guys are okay with this?

- Hey, you're making me, you know,

where you're like talking about my marriage

or something like this,

and I'm not realizing

I've been in a toxic relationship all along.

Yet, I just get used to it.

- That to me, by the way, was the magic of Ruby.

It opened my eyes

to help beautiful program could be.

I didn't know I'd been working in ASP.

I'd been working in PHP.

I didn't even have the concept

that aesthetics beautiful code

was something we could optimize for that.

Something we could pursue.

And even more than that,

that we could pursue it above other objectives.

That Ruby is as beautiful as it is.

It's not an accident and it's not easy.

Ruby itself is implemented in C.

It's very difficult to parse Ruby code,

because Ruby is written for humans

and humans are messy creatures.

They like things in just the right way.

I can't fully explain why the __init___ make me repulse,

but it does.

And when I look at the Ruby alternative,

it's really instructive.

So it's def, same part, D-E-F, space,

initialize, parentheses.

Not even parentheses.

If you don't need to call it within the arguments,

there's not even a parentheses.

That in itself is actually also a major part.

If the human doesn't need the additional characters,

we're not just gonna put them in

because it'd be nicer to parse for the computer.

We're gonna get rid of the semicolons.

We're gonna get rid of the parentheses.

We're gonna get rid of the underscores.

We're gonna get rid of all that ugliness,

all the line noise

and boil it down to its pure essentials.

And at the same time, we're not gonna abbreviate.

This is a key difference in the aesthetics

between Ruby and Python as well.

init, short of type, it's only five characters.

Initialize is a lot longer, but it looks a lot better

and you don't type it very often.

So you should look at something pretty.

If you don't have to do it all the time,

it's okay that it's long.

Those kinds of aesthetic evaluations

are rife all over the Ruby language.

But let me give you an even better example.

The if conditional.

That's the bedrock of all programming languages.

They have the if conditional.

If you take most programming languages,

they all have if.

That's basically the same in almost every language.

Space, start parentheses, we all do that.

And then you have perhaps,

let's say you're calling a object

called user.isadmin, close parentheses, close parentheses,

start brackets, and here's what we're gonna do

if the user is an admin, right?

That would be a normal programming language.

Ruby doesn't do it like that.

Ruby boils almost all of it away.

We start with the if.

Okay, that's the same.

No parenthesis necessary

because there's no ambiguity for the human

to distinguish that the next part

is just a single statement.

So you do if, space, user, dot,

admin, question mark.

No open brackets, no parentheses, no nothing.

Next, open line.

Here's your conditional.

That question mark means nothing to the computer,

but it meets something to the human.

Ruby put in the predicate method style

purely as a communication tool between humans.

It's actually more work for the interpreter

to be able to see that this question mark is there.

Why is this question mark in here?

Because it just reads so nicely.

If user.admin?

That's a very human phrase, but it gets better.

You can turn this around.

You can have your statement

you want to execute before the conditional.

You can do user.upgrade.

Say you're calling an upgrade method on a user.

Space, if, space, user.admin?.

We do the thing if the thing is true.

Instead of saying, if the thing is true, do the thing.

But it gets even better.

This is why I love this example with the conditional,

because you can keep diving into it.

So let's flip it around.

user.downgrade if !not user.admin, right?

That'd be a typical way of writing it.

Ruby goes, that exclamation point is light noise.

Why do we have if

and then an exclamation point, that's ugly.

We could do user.downgrade unless user.admin?

That to me is an encapsulation of the incredible beauty

that Ruby affords the programmer through ambiguity

that is only to serve the human reader and writer.

All of these statements we've just discussed,

they're the same for the computer.

It'll combine down to the same C code.

That'll compile down to the same assembly code.

It makes no difference whatsoever.

In fact, it just makes it harder to write an interpreter.

But for the human who gets to choose

whether the statement comes before the conditional

or the predicate method has, it's just incredible.

It reads like poetry at some point.

- It's also incredible that, you know,

one language designer's creating that, you know,

Guido van Rossum also, it's like one person

gets to make these extremely difficult decision

because you have to think about

how does that all get parsed?

And you have to think about the thousands,

if it's a popular language that millions of people

that end up using this.

And what they feel, what that question mark

for the if statement, what does that feel like

for the user? - That's what Matz

thought about because he started his entire mission

off a different premise

than almost every programming language designer

that I'd heard, at least articulate the vision.

That his number one goal was programmer happiness.

That his number one goal was the affordances

that would allow programmers to articulate code

in ways that not just execute it correctly,

but were a joy to write and were a joy to read.

And that vision is based on a fundamentally

different view of humanity.

There's no greater contrast between Matz

and James Gosling, the designer of Java.

I wanted to listen to James talk about the design of Java.

Why was it the way it was?

Why was it so rigid?

And he was very blunt about it,

which, by the way, I really appreciate.

And I think Gosling has done a tremendous job with Java.

But his view of humanity is rather dark.

His view of humanity was programmers

at the average are stupid creatures.

They cannot be trusted,

which sophisticated programming languages

because they're gonna shoot their foot off or their handoff.

And that would be kind of inconvenient

to the regional development office

of a mid-tier insurance company

writing code that has to last for 20 years.

Now it's actually a very Thomas-Sowell view

of constrained capacity in humans

that I've come to appreciate much later in life.

But it's also a very depressing view of programmers

that there are just certain programmers

who are too dumb to appreciate code poetry.

There are too ignorant to learn how to write it well.

We need to give them a sandbox

where they just won't hurt themselves too much.

Matz went the completely opposite direction.

He believes in humanity.

He believes in the unlimited capacity of programmers

to learn and become better.

So much so that he's willing to put the stranger

at his own level.

This is the second part I truly appreciate about Ruby.

Ruby allows you to extend base classes.

You know how we just talked about 5.times

is a way to iterate over a statement five times?

That five is obviously a base class.

It's a number.

Do you know what?

You can add your own methods to that.

I did, extensively.

In Rails, we have something called active support,

which is essentially my dialect of Ruby

for programming web applications.

And I'll give you one example.

I've added a method called days to the Number.

So if you do 5.days,

you get five days in seconds.

Because seconds is the way we set cache expiration times

and other things like that.

So you can say cache expires in 5.days.

And you're gonna get

whatever's five times - That's nice.

- 24 times 60 times 60 is,

or whatever the math is, right?

Very humanly readable.

In a novel programming language,

you would type out the seconds

and then you would have a little comment above it

saying this represent five days.

In Ruby, you get to write five days.

But even better than that,

Matz didn't come up with it.

Matz didn't need the five days.

I needed that because I needed to expire caches.

I was allowed by Matz to extend his story

with my own chapters unequal footing,

such that a reader Ruby could not tell the difference

between the code Matz wrote and the code that I wrote.

He trusted me as a complete stranger from Denmark

who had never met to mess with his beautiful story.

That level of trust is essentially unheard of.

I know there are other program languages that allow things

with macros and so forth.

But none do it in a way like Ruby does it.

None does it with an articulated vision of humanity,

a trust in humanity like Matz does,

that is the opposite end of the spectrum of Java.

- Yeah, I mean for my aesthetic sensibilities,

just the way you describe 5.days,

that's really pleasant to me.

Like I could see myself sitting alone,

sleep deprived, and just writing that.

It's just an easy thing.

You can write it in a long way with a comment.

You can write multiple lines.

You could do, and now with AI,

I'm sure it's gonna generate it correctly,

but there's something really pleasant

about the simplicity of that.

I'm not sure what that is.

But you're right,

there is a good feeling there.

And I'm sure we'll talk about happiness

from all kinds of philosophical angles,

but you know, that is what happiness is made of.

That little - Exactly.

- good feeling there.

- It's the good feeling that come out of a concept

compressed to its pure essence.

There's nothing you can take away

from that statement that's superfluous.

- But see, I also wanna push back a little bit

'cause I also a program named Perl a bunch.

Just be cool.

So like it's not all about compression.

- No, you can compress it too far.

Perl golf is a thing

where you can turn programs into something

that's unreadable for humans.

Now the great thing about Perl

was that it came out before Ruby.

# Chapter 5

there is a good feeling there.

And I'm sure we'll talk about happiness

from all kinds of philosophical angles,

but you know, that is what happiness is made of.

That little - Exactly.

- good feeling there.

- It's the good feeling that come out of a concept

compressed to its pure essence.

There's nothing you can take away

from that statement that's superfluous.

- But see, I also wanna push back a little bit

'cause I also a program named Perl a bunch.

Just be cool.

So like it's not all about compression.

- No, you can compress it too far.

Perl golf is a thing

where you can turn programs into something

that's unreadable for humans.

Now the great thing about Perl

was that it came out before Ruby.

Matz was a great student of Wall,

was a great student of Perl,

was a great student of Python

and Smalltalk and Lisp.

He took inspiration from all of these prior attempts

at creating good programming languages

and really edited down the very best bits into this.

So he was able to learn from his lessons.

But what I found incredible about Ruby

is that here we are 2025,

Ruby has been worked on for over 30 years,

and essentially the first draft

is 90% of what we're still using.

There was almost a sense of divine inspiration

possible in wherever Matz was writing

that initial version of Ruby

that transcended time to such a degree

that no one has still even begun to reach it.

This is the other thing I always find fascinating.

I generally believe in the efficient market theory

that if someone comes up with a better mousetrap

or better idea, others will eventually copy them

to such an extent that perhaps the original mousetrap

is no longer even remembered.

No one has been able to copy that essence of Ruby.

They borrowed elements, that's totally fine,

but Ruby still stands taller than everyone else

on these metrics, on this trust in humanity and programmers.

- And we should also say like, you know,

maybe the perfect programming language

that metric and then there's the successful language

and those are often different.

There's something wonderful about

the Brendan Eich story of creating JavaScript.

There's something truly beautiful

about the way JavaScript took over the world.

I've recently got to visit the Amazon jungle

and just one of my favorite things to do

is just to watch the ants take over anything, everything.

And it's just like it's a nice distributor system.

It's a messy thing that doesn't seem to be ordered,

but it just works

and the machinery of it. - Worse is Better.

Worse is Better.

I mean that's actually the name of a pattern

in software development

and other ways of how do is the pattern of Linux.

Linux was quantifiably worse

than I think it was Minx at the time.

Other ways of it that were more cathedral less bizarre

and it's still one that there's something to it

that the imperfections can help something go forward.

It's actually a trick I've studied

to the degree that I now incorporated

in almost all open source that I do.

I make sure that when I release the first version

of any new thing I work on, it's a little broken.

It's a little busted in ways

that invite people to come in and help me.

Because there's no easier way

to get the collaboration of other programmers

than to put something out

that they know how to fix and improve.

- Yeah, that's awesome. - But Ruby is somehow,

or was at least a little bit different in that regard.

Not in all regards.

Matz got the ethos of the language,

the design of language just right.

But the first versions of Ruby were terribly slow.

It's taken, I mean hundreds of man years

to get Ruby to be both this beautiful

yet also highly efficient and really fast.

- And we should say that the thing

that made you fall in love

with this particular programming language

is metaprogramming?

- Yes, so that takes all of these elements

we've just talked about and turned them up to 11.

I'll explain metaprogramming

real quick. - Yeah, please.

- Metaprogramming is essentially

a version of the 5.days.

You get to add keywords to the language.

Active record is the part of Rails

that communicates with the database.

This is a system where every table in the database

is represented by a class.

So if we take the user example, again,

you do class user descends from active record base,

and then the first line you can write is this.

I want my users to have many posts or have many comments.

Let's do that.

We're making some system where users can make comments.

The very next line is has_many, space, colon comments.

Now you've set up a dependency

between users and comments

that will give your whole host of access and factory methods

for users to be able to own comments,

to create comments, to update comments

in that line alone has many looks like a keyword.

It looks like it's part of the Ruby language.

That's metaprogramming.

When Rails is able to add these elements

to how you define a class

and then that runs code that adds a bunch of methods

to the use of class, that's metaprogramming.

And when metaprogramming is used in this way,

we call it domain specific languages.

You take a generic language like Ruby

and you tailor it to a certain domain like describing

relationships in a database at a object level.

And this is one of those early examples

where you can do, user has many comments.

Belongs _two_ :account.

Now you've set up a one-to-one relationship

before we had a one-to-many relationship.

Rails is rife with all these kinds

of domain specific languages

where at sometimes it doesn't even look like Ruby.

You can't identify Ruby keywords.

You can just identify

what looks like keywords in its own programming language.

Now again, I know that Lisp and others also do this stuff.

They just do it with the maximum amount of line noise

that can ever be crammed into a programming language.

And Ruby does it at a level where you cannot tell

my metaprogramming from Matz's keywords

and with zero line noise.

- Yeah, I should say that my first love was Lisp.

So there's a slow tear that you can't see.

- I've actually never written any real Lisp myself.

- Well, how can you judge it so harshly then?

- 'Cause I have two eyes and I can look at code,

and my aesthetic sensibilities forbid me

to even go much further.

Which is a limitation, I know.

I should actually dive into Lisp

because I've found that I've learned a lot

just diving into, maybe I'm insulting Lisp again here,

but the past of programming languages

with Smalltalk, for example.

I think Smalltalk is a incredible experiment

that also worked but isn't suitable

for today's programming environments.

- I love that we're talking about Ruby

so much and what beautiful code is

and what a beautiful programming language is.

So one of the things that is I think implied

maybe you made explicit in your descriptions there

is that Ruby is dynamic typing versus strict typing.

And you have been not just saying that it's a nice thing,

but that you will defend dynamic typing to the death.

Like that freedom is a powerful freedom to preserve.

- It's the essence of what makes Ruby Ruby.

This is why I don't fully understand

when people call for Ruby to add static typing.

'Cause to me, it's the bedrock of what this is.

Why would you wanna turn one of the most beautiful languages

into something far uglier?

This is one of my primary objections to static typing.

It's not just that it limits you in certain ways.

It makes metaprogramming harder.

I write a bunch of metaprogramming.

I've seen what it takes to do metaprogramming TypeScript.

That was actually one of the things

that just really sent me on a tear of getting meta

or getting TypeScript

out of some of the projects that I'm involved with.

We pulled TypeScript out of turbo.

One of the front-end frameworks that we have,

because I tried to write to metaprogramming

in TypeScript and I was just infuriated.

I don't want that experience,

but I also don't want it from an aesthetic point of view.

I hate repetition.

We've just talked about how much I love that Ruby boils

all of these expressions down to its essence.

You can't remove one dot.

You can't remove one character without losing something.

This moment you go for static typing that you declare,

at least I know there are ways

to do implied typing and so forth.

But let's just take the stereotypical case

of a example, for example.

Capital U, user,

I'm declaring the type of the variable;

lowercase user, I'm now naming my variable;

equals uppercase user or new uppercase user.

I've repeated user three times.

I don't have time for this.

I don't have sensibilities for this.

I don't want my Ruby polluted with this.

Now I understand all the arguments

for why people like static typing

when the primary arguments is that it makes tooling easier.

It makes it easier to do auto complete

in editors, for example.

It makes it easier to find certain kinds of bugs

because maybe you're calling methods that don't exist

on an object and the editor

can actually catch that bug before you even run it.

I don't care.

First of all, I don't write code with tools.

I write them with text editors.

I chisel them out of the screen with my bare hands.

I don't auto complete.

And this is why I love Ruby so much,

and this is why I continue to be in love

with the text editor rather than the IDE.

I don't want an IDE.

I want my fingers to have to individually

type out every element of it

because it will force me to stay in the world

where Ruby is beautiful.

Because as soon as it gets easy

to type a lot of boilerplate, well guess what?

You can have a lot of boilerplate.

Every single language basically

that has great tooling support has a much higher tolerance

for boilerplate because the thinking is, well,

you're not typing it anyway,

you're just auto completing it.

I don't want that at all.

I want something where the fabric I'm working in,

it's just a text file.

There's nothing else to it.

So these things play together.

There's the aesthetic part, there's the tooling part,

there's the metaprogramming part.

There's the fact that Ruby's ethos of duck typing,

I dunno if you've heard that term before.

It's essentially not about, can I call this method,

if a object is of a certain class.

It is, can I call this method if the method responds?

It's very out of Smalltalk in that regard.

You don't actually check

of whether that class has the method,

which allows you to dynamically add methods at runtime

and do all sorts of really interesting things

that underpin all the beautiful metaprogramming

that we do in Ruby.

I don't wanna lose any of that.

And I don't care for the benefits.

One of the benefits I see touted over and over again

is that it's much easier to write correct software.

You can have fewer bugs.

You're gonna have less null pointer exceptions.

You're gonna have less all of this stuff.

Yeah, I don't have any of that.

It's just not something

that occurs in my standard mode of operation.

I'm not saying I don't have bugs, of course I do,

but I catch those bugs with unit testing,

with integration testing.

Those are the kinds of precautions

that will catch logical bugs.

Things that compile but are wrong

along with the uncompilable stuff.

So I've never been drawn into this world,

and part of it is because I work

on a certain class of systems.

I fully accept that.

If you're writing systems

that have five, 10, 50 million lines of code

with hundreds, thousands,

or tens of thousands of programmers,

I fully accept that you need different methods.

What I object to is the idea

that what's right for a code base

of 10 million lines of code

with a hundred thousand programmers working on it

is also the same thing I should be using in my bedroom

to create Basecamp, because I'm just a single individual.

That's complete nonsense.

In the real world,

we would know that that makes no sense at all.

That you don't, I don't know,

use your Pagani to go pick up groceries at Costco.

It's a bad vehicle for that.

It just doesn't have the space.

You don't wanna muddy the beautiful seats.

You don't wanna do any of those things.

We know that certain things

that are very good in certain domains

don't apply to all.

In programming languages,

it seems like we forget that.

Now, to be fair, I also had a little bit perhaps

of a reputation of forgetting that.

When I first learned Ruby,

I was so head over heels in love

with this programming language

that I almost found it unconceivable

that anyone would choose any other programming language

at all to write web applications.

And I kind of engaged the evangelism of Ruby on Rails

in that spirit as a crusade,

as I just need to teach you the gospel.

I just need to show you this conditional code

that we just talked about

and you will convert at the point of a sharp argument.

Now, I learned that that's not the way.

And part of the reason

it's not the way is the programmers think differently.

Our brains are configured differently.

My brain is configured perfectly for Ruby.

Perfectly for a dynamically duck typed language

that I can chisel code out of a text editor with.

And other people need the security of an IDE.

They want the security of classes

that won't compile unless you call the methods on it.

I have come to accept that, but most programmers don't.

They're still stuck in, essentially, I like static typing.

Therefore, static typing is the only way

to create reliable correct systems,

which is just such a mind blowing, to be blunt,

idiotic thing to say in the face of evidence,

mountains of evidence to the contrary.

This is one of the reasons I'm so in love with Shopify

as the flagship application for Ruby on Rails.

Shopify exists at a scale

that most programmers will never touch.

On Black Friday,

I think Shopify did 1 million requests per second.

That's not 1 million requests of images.

That's of dynamic requests

that are funneling through the pipeline of commerce.

I mean, Shopify runs something like 30%

of all e-commerce stores on the damn internet.

A huge portion of all commerce in total

runs through Shopify and that runs on Ruby on Rails.

So Ruby on Rails is able to scale

up to that level without using

static typing in all of what it does.

Now I know they've done certain experiments in certain ways

because they are hitting some of the limits

that you will hit with dynamic typing.

And some of those limits you hit

with dynamic typing are actually, by the way,

just limits you hit when you write 5 million lines of code.

I think the Shopify monolith

is about 5 million lines of code.

At that scale, everything breaks

# Chapter 6

I think Shopify did 1 million requests per second.

That's not 1 million requests of images.

That's of dynamic requests

that are funneling through the pipeline of commerce.

I mean, Shopify runs something like 30%

of all e-commerce stores on the damn internet.

A huge portion of all commerce in total

runs through Shopify and that runs on Ruby on Rails.

So Ruby on Rails is able to scale

up to that level without using

static typing in all of what it does.

Now I know they've done certain experiments in certain ways

because they are hitting some of the limits

that you will hit with dynamic typing.

And some of those limits you hit

with dynamic typing are actually, by the way,

just limits you hit when you write 5 million lines of code.

I think the Shopify monolith

is about 5 million lines of code.

At that scale, everything breaks

because you're at the frontier

of what humans are capable of doing

with programming languages.

The difference in part

is that Ruby is such a succinct language

that those 5 million,

if they had been written in, let's just say Go or Java

would've been 50 or 25.

Now that might have alleviated some of the problems

that you have when you work on huge systems

with many programmers.

But it certainly would also have compounded them

trying to understand 25 million lines of code.

- So the thing does scale.

That's a persistent myth that it doesn't scale

Shopify and others.

But Shopify thinks a great example.

By the way, I love Shopify and I love Tobi, amazing.

- You gotta have Tobi on. - Yeah, for sure.

- Just talking to him this morning.

- For sure, he's a brilliant.

I got to hang out with him

in the desert somewhere, I forget in Utah.

He's just a brilliant human.

And Shopify, shopify.com/lex has been supporting

this podcast for the longest time.

I don't think actually Tobi knows

that they sponsor this podcast.

I mean this is a big company, right?

- It's a huge company.

I think just under 10,000 employees,

market cap of 120 billion,

GMV of a quarter of a trillion every quarter.

- And he's involved with the details though.

- He is, very much so.

Funny story about Tobi.

Tobi was on the Rails core team

back in the mid 2000s.

Tobi himself wrote Active Merchant,

which is one of the frameworks for creating shops.

He wrote the Liquid templating language

that Shopify still uses to this day.

He has a huge list of contributions

to the Rails ecosystem, and he's the CEO of the company.

Yeah, I think it's just...

It's very inspiring to me

because it's such at the opposite end of what I like to do.

I like to chisel code with my own hands most of the day.

He runs a company of almost 10,000 people that is literally

like world commerce depends on it.

A level of criticality I can't even begin to understand.

And yet we can see eye to eye

on so many of these fundamental questions

in computer science and program development.

That is a dynamic range

to be able to encompass Rails being a great tool

for the one developer

who's just starting out with an idea

who don't even fully know everything.

Who is right at the level where PHP

would've been a good fit in those late '90s

because yeah, I could probably upload

something to an FTP server, and so on.

Rails does have more complexity than that,

but it also has so much longer runway.

The runway goes all the way to goddamn Shopify.

That is about the most convincing argument I can make

for sort of dynamic range that we can do a lot of it.

And even having said that,

Shopify is the outlier of course.

I don't think about Shopify

as the primary target when I write Rails.

I think of the single developer.

Actually, I do think about Shopify.

But I don't think about Shopify now.

I think of Shopify when Tobi was writing Snow Devil,

which was the first e-commerce store to sell snowboards

that he created, that was the pre-Shopify Shopify.

He created all by himself.

And that was possible because Ruby on Rails

isn't just about beautiful code.

It's just as much about productivity.

It's just as much about the impact

that an individual programmer is able to have.

That they can build system

where they can keep the whole thing in their head

and be able to move it forward

such that you can go from one developer

sitting and working on something

and that something is Shopify

and it turns into what it is today.

When we talk about programming languages

and we compare 'em,

we often compare 'em at a very late stage.

Like what is the better programming language

for let's say Twitter in 2009

when it's already a huge success.

Twitter was started on Ruby on Rails.

They then hit some scaling problems.

It was a big debacle at the time.

They end up then I think writing it in some other language,

which by the way I think is the best advertisement

ever for Ruby on Rails,

because nothing fucking happened

for 10 years after they switched over, right?

Essentially zero innovation.

Some of that was because they were doing a long conversion,

and all of the early success

in part came because they had the agility

quickly change and adopt and so forth.

That's what startups needs.

That's what Shopify needed.

That's what Twitter needed.

That's what everyone needs.

And that's the number one priority for Ruby on Rails.

To make sure that we don't lose that.

Because what happens so often when development tools

and program language driven by huge companies

is that they mirror their org chart.

React and everything else needed to use that

is in some ways a reflection of how Meta builds Facebook.

'Cause of course it is.

Because of course it's an destruction of that.

I'm not saying React isn't a great tool

and that can't be used by smaller teams.

Of course it can.

But it's born in a very different context

than something like Ruby on Rails.

- Let me say this a small aside

because I think we might return to Shopify

and celebrate it often.

Just a sort of personal note.

This particular podcast has way more sponsors

and sponsors that want to be sponsors

than I could possibly ever have.

And it's really, really important for me

to not give a shit,

and to be able to celebrate people.

Like I celebrate people.

I celebrate companies.

And I don't care that they're sponsoring.

I really don't care.

I just wanna make that very explicit

'cause we're gonna continue saying

positive things about Shopify.

I don't care.

Stop sponsoring.

It doesn't really matter to me.

But yeah, I just wanna make that explicit.

So, but to linger on the scaling thing

with the Twitter and the Shopify,

can you just explain to me

what Shopify is doing with the YJIT?

What did they have to try to do to scale this thing?

Because that's kind of an incredible story, right?

- Yeah, so one of the great contributions

that Shopify has made to the entire Ruby ecosystem,

not just Rails but in particular Rails is YJIT.

So YJIT is their compiler for Ruby.

That just makes everything a lot more efficient

and at Shopify scale eking out even a five,

10% improvement in Ruby's overhead and execution time

is a huge deal.

Now, Shopify didn't need YJIT.

Shopify was already running

on the initial version of Ruby

that was, I think 10 times slower than what we have today.

If you look back upon the Ruby 186,

that Tobi probably started on just as I started on,

and that was enough to propel Shopify

to the scale that it has today.

A lot of the scaling conversation

in is lost in a failure to distinguish two things.

Scale is kind of one package we talk about

when there are really multiple packages inside of it.

One is runtime performance, latency.

How fast can you execute a single request?

Can it happen fast enough that the user

will not notice?

If your Rails request takes a second and a half to execute,

the user's gonna notice.

Your app is gonna feel slow and sluggish.

You have to get that response time down below,

let's say at least 300 milliseconds.

I like to target a hundred milliseconds as my latency.

That's kind of performance.

How much performance of that kind of latency

can you squeeze out of a single CPU core,

that tells you something about

what the price of a single request will be.

But then whether you can deal

with 1 million requests a second

like Shopify is doing right now.

If you have one box

that can do a thousand requests a second,

you just need X boxes to get up to a million.

And what you'll actually find

is that when it comes to programming languages,

they're all the same in this way.

They all scale largely beautifully horizontally.

You just add more boxes.

The hard parts of scaling a Shopify

is typically the program language.

It's the database.

And that's actually one of the challenges

that Shopify has now is how do you deal with MySQL

at the scale that they're operating at?

When do you need to move to other databases

to get worldwide performance?

All of these things.

The questions about scaling Ruby are economic questions.

If we are spending so and so much on application servers,

if we can get just 5% more performance out of Ruby,

well we could save 5% of those servers

and that could filter down into the budget.

Now that analysis concludes into basically one thing.

Ruby is a luxury language.

It's a luxury, the highest luxury in my opinion.

It is the Coco Chanel of programming languages.

Something that not everyone can afford.

And I mean this in the best possible way.

There are some applications on the internet

where each request has so little value,

you can't afford to use a luxurious language

like Ruby to program in it.

You simply have to slum it with a C or a Go

or some other low level language or Rust,

talk about line noise there for...

- It's like the thrift store of languages.

- Exactly, where you need kind of just...

you need a very low level to do it.

You can't afford to use a luxury language

to use to build it with.

That's not true of Shopify.

It wasn't true of Basecamp even back in 2004.

It's not been true of 99%

of all web applications ever created

because the main cost component

of 99% of web applications,

it's not CPU course.

It's wet course.

It's human course.

It's human capacity to understand and involve systems.

It's their personal productivity.

I did a calculation once

when someone had for the 400th time said that,

"Oh, if you switch from Ruby to some faster language,

you could save a bunch of money."

And I calculated it out that at the time,

and I think the last time I did this calculation

was almost a decade ago.

We were spending about 15% of our operating budget

on Ruby application service.

So for me to improve my cost profile of the business

by seven percentage points,

I'd have to pick something twice as fast.

That's quite hard.

Versus if Ruby and Ruby on Rails

was even 10% more productive than something else,

I would move the needle far more

because making individual programmers more productive

actually matters a lot more.

This is why people are so excited about AI.

This is why they're freaking out

over the fact that a single programmer in Silicon Valley

who makes $300,000 a year

can now do the work of three or five, at least in theory.

I haven't actually seen that fully in practice,

but let's just assume the theory is correct

if not now, then in six months.

That's a huge deal.

That matters so much more

than whether you can squeeze a few more cycles

out of the CPU,

when it comes to these kinds of business applications.

If you're making unreal engine rendering stuff

like Tim Sweeney you had on.

Yeah, he needs to really sweat all those details.

The Nanite engine can't run on Ruby.

It's never going to.

It would not meant for that, fine.

These kinds of business applications absolutely can

and everything that people are excited

about AI for right now,

that extra capacity to just do more.

That was why we were excited about Ruby

back in the early 2000s.

That was be because I saw

that if we could even squeeze out

a 10% improvement of the human programmer,

we'd be able to do so much more for so much less.

- Probably argue about this,

but I really like working together with AI,

collaborating with AI.

And I would argue that the kind of code you want AI

to generate is human readable, human interpretable.

If it's generating Perl golf code,

it's not a collaboration.

So it has to be speaking the human.

It's not just you're writing the prompts in English.

You also want to read the responses

in the human interpretable language like Ruby, right?

So that's actually is beneficial for AI too.

'Cause you've kind of said that for you the sculptor,

the sort of the elitist Coco Chanel sculptor,

you want to on your fancy keyboard

to type every single letter

yourself of your own fingers.

But it's also that the benefit

of Ruby also applies in once some of that is written by AI

and you're actually doing

with your own fingers the editing.

Because you can interact with it

because it's human interpretable.

- The paradigm I really love with this

was something Elon actually said on one of your shows

when you guys were talking about Neuralink,

that Neuralink allows the bandwidth

between you and the machine to increase.

That language either spoken or written

is very low bandwidth.

If you are to calculate just how many bits

we can exchange as we are sitting here, it's very slow.

Ruby has a much higher bandwidth

of communication revealed conveys

so much more concept per character

than most other programming languages do.

So when you are collaborating with AI,

you want really high bandwidth.

You want it to be able to produce programs with you,

whether you're letting it write the code or not,

that both of you can actually understand really quickly

and that you could compress a grand concept,

a grand system into far fewer parts

that both of you can understand.

Now, I actually love collaborating with AI too.

I love chiseling my code

and the way I use AI is in a separate window.

I don't let it drive my code.

I've tried that.

I've tried the cursors and the wind surfaces

and I don't enjoy that way of writing.

And one of the reasons I don't enjoy

that way of writing is I can literally feel competence

draining out of my fingers.

Like that level of immediacy

with the material disappears.

And the where I felt this the most was I did this remix

of Ubuntu called Omakub when I switched to Linux,

and it's all written in Bash.

I'd never written any serious

amount of code in Bash before.

So I was using AI to collaborate,

to write a bunch of Bash with me,

'cause I needed all this.

I knew what I wanted.

I could express it in Ruby.

But I thought it was an interesting challenge

to filter through Bash because what I was doing

was setting up a Linux machine.

That's basically what Bash was designed for.

It's a great constraint.

But what I found myself doing was asking AI

for the same way of expressing a conditional,

for example, in Bash over and over again.

That by not typing it, I wasn't learning it.

I was using it, I was getting the expression I wanted,

# Chapter 7

And the where I felt this the most was I did this remix

of Ubuntu called Omakub when I switched to Linux,

and it's all written in Bash.

I'd never written any serious

amount of code in Bash before.

So I was using AI to collaborate,

to write a bunch of Bash with me,

'cause I needed all this.

I knew what I wanted.

I could express it in Ruby.

But I thought it was an interesting challenge

to filter through Bash because what I was doing

was setting up a Linux machine.

That's basically what Bash was designed for.

It's a great constraint.

But what I found myself doing was asking AI

for the same way of expressing a conditional,

for example, in Bash over and over again.

That by not typing it, I wasn't learning it.

I was using it, I was getting the expression I wanted,

but I wasn't learning it.

And I got a little scared.

I got a little scared like,

is this the end of learning?

Am I no longer learning if I'm not typing?

And the way I, for me, recast that

was, I don't wanna give up on the AI.

It's such a better experience as a programmer

to look up APIs, to get a second opinion on something,

to do a draft.

But I have to do the typing myself

because you learn with your fingers.

If you're learning how to play the guitar,

you can watch as many YouTube videos as you want.

You're not gonna learn the guitar.

You have to put your fingers on the strings

to actually learn the motions.

And I think there is a parallel here to programming

where programming has to be learned in part

by the actual typing.

- I'm just really, this is fascinating.

Listen, part of my brain agrees with you.

100% part doesn't.

I think AI should be in the loop of learning.

Now current systems don't do that,

but I think it's very possible for cursor to say,

to basically force you to type certain things.

So like if you set the mode of learning,

I don't want to be this sort of give up on AI.

I think vibe coding is a skill.

So for an experienced programmer

it's too easy to dismiss vibe coding as a thing.

- [DHH] I agree, I wouldn't dismiss it.

- But I think you need to start building that skill

and start to figure out

how do you prevent the competency from slipping away

from your fingers and brain.

Like how do you develop that skill in parallel

to the other skill?

I don't know.

I think it's a fascinating puzzle though.

I know too many really strong programmers

that just kind of avoid AI,

'cause it's currently a little too dumb.

- Yes, it's a little too slow.

It's actually my main problem.

It's a little too dumb in some ways,

but it's a little too slow in other ways.

When I use Claude's code,

the terminal version of a Claude,

which is actually my preferred way of using it,

I get too impatient.

It feels like I'm going back to a time

where code had to compile

and I had to go do something else.

A boil some tea while the code is compiling.

Well, I've been working in Ruby for 20 years.

I don't have compiled weight in me anymore.

So there's that aspect of it.

But I think the more crucial aspect

for me is I really care about the competence.

And I've seen what happens to even great programmers

the moment they put away the keyboard.

Because even before AI,

this would happen as soon as people would get promoted.

Most great programmers who work in large businesses

stop writing code on a daily basis

because they simply have too many meetings to attend to.

They have too many other things to do.

And invariably they lose touch with programming.

That doesn't mean they forget everything.

But if you don't have your fingers in the sauce, source,

you are going to lose touch with it.

There's just no other way.

I don't want that because I enjoy it too much.

This is not just about outcomes.

This is what's crucial to understand

programming for programmers who like to code

is not just about the programs they get out of it.

That may be the economic value.

It's not the only human value.

The human value is just much in the expression.

When someone who sits down on a guitar

and plays "Stairway to Heaven,"

there's a perfect recording

of that that will last in eternity.

You can just put it on Spotify.

You don't actually need to do it.

The joy is to command the guitar yourself.

The joy of a programmer, of me as a programmer,

is to type the code myself.

If I elevate myself,

if I promote myself out of programming,

I turn myself into a project manager.

A project manager of a murder of AI crows

as I wrote the other day.

I could have been become a project manager my whole career.

I could have become a project manager 20 years ago

if I didn't care to write code myself.

And I just wanted outcomes.

That's how I got started in programming.

I just wanted outcomes.

Then I fell in love with programming

and now I'd rather retire than giving it up.

Now that doesn't mean

you can't have your cake and needed to.

I've done some vibe coding

where I didn't care that I wasn't playing myself.

I just wanted to see something.

There was an idea in my head.

I wanted to see something.

That's fine.

I also use AI all day long.

In fact, I'm already at the point

where if you took it away from me,

I'd be like, oh my god,

how do we even look things up on the internet anymore?

Is Stack Overflow still around?

Or I'm still a thing?

Like how do I even find answers

to some of these questions I have all day long.

I don't wanna give up AI.

In fact, I'd say the way I like to use AI,

I'm getting smarter every because of AI.

Because I'm using AI to have it explain things to me.

Even stupid questions.

I would be a little embarrassed

to even enter into Google.

AI is perfectly willing to give me the ELI5 explanation

of some Unix command.

I should have known already,

but I don't, I'm sorry,

can you just explain it to me and now I know the thing.

So at the end of the day of me working with AI all day long,

I'm a little bit smarter.

Like 5%, sorry, not 5%, half a percent maybe.

That compounds over time.

But what I've also seen,

when I worked on the Omakub project

and I tried to let AI drive for me,

I felt I was maybe half a percent dumber

at the end of the day.

- Okay, you said a lot of interesting things.

First of all, let's just start at the very fact

that asking dumb questions.

If you go to Stack Overflow

and ask a dumb question

or read somebody else's dumb question and the answer to it,

there's a lot of judgment there.

AI sometimes to an excessive degree has no judgment.

It usually says, oh, that's a great question.

- [DHH] To a fault.

- Yeah, oh, that's wonderful.

Yeah, I mean, it's so conducive to learning.

It's such a wonderful tool of learning

and I too would miss it.

And it's a great basically search engine

into all kinds of nuances

of a particular programming language,

especially if you don't know it that well

or like APIs you can load in documentation.

It's just so great for learning.

I, for me personally...

I mean, on the happiness scale,

it makes me more excited to program.

I don't know what that is exactly.

Part of that is the, I'm really sorry.

Stack Overflow is an incredible website,

but there is a negativity there.

There's a judgment there.

It's just exciting to be out like with a hype man

next to me, just like saying, yeah, that's a great idea.

And I'll say, no, that's wrong.

I'll correct the AI,

and the AI will say, "You're absolutely right.

How did I not think about that?"

You know, rewrite the code.

I'm like, holy shit, I'm having, that's like a buddy.

That's like really being positive

and is very smart and is challenging me to think.

And even if I never use the code it generates,

I'm already a better programmer.

But actually the deeper thing is for some reason

I'm having more fun.

That's a really, really important thing.

- I like to think of it as a pair programmer

for exactly that reason.

Pair programming came a vogue in like the 2000s.

Where you'd have two programmers in front of one machine

and you'd push the keyboard between you.

One programmer would be driving, they'd be typing in.

The other programmer would essentially sit

and watch the code,

suggest improvements, look something up.

That was a really interesting dynamic.

Now unfortunately, I'm an introvert,

so I can do that for about five minutes

before I want to jump off a bridge.

So it doesn't work for me as a full-time occupation.

But AI allows me to have all the best

of that experience all the time.

Now I think what's really interesting,

what you said about it makes it more fun.

I hadn't actually thought about that,

but what it's made more fun to me is to be a beginner again.

It made it more fun to learn Bash

successfully for the first time.

Now I had to do the detour

where I let it write all the code for me

and I realized I wasn't learning nearly as much

as I hoped I would

and that I started doing once I typed it out myself.

But it gave me the confidence that, you know what?

If I need to do some iOS programming myself,

I haven't done that in probably six years

was the last time I dabbled in it.

I never really built anything for real.

I feel highly confident now that I could sit down with AI

and I could have something in the app store

by the end of the week.

I would not have that confidence

unless I had a pair of programming body like AI.

I don't actually use it very much for Ruby code.

I'm occasionally impressed

whenever I try it, they're like,

oh, it got this one thing right.

That is truly remarkable and it's actually pretty good.

And then I'll ask you two more questions

and I go like, oh yeah, okay.

If you were my junior programmer,

I'd start tapping my fingers

and going like, you gotta shape up.

Now the great thing of course

is we can just wait five minutes.

The Anthropic CEO seems to think that 90% of all code

by the end of the year is gonna be written by AI.

I am more than a little bit skeptical about that,

but I'm open-minded about the prospect

that programming potentially

will turn into a horse when done manually.

Something we do recreationally

is no longer a mode of transportation to get around LA.

You're not gonna saddle up

and go to the grocery store

and pick up stuff from whole foods in your saddlebacks.

That's just not a thing anymore.

That could be the future for programming,

for manual programming entirely possible.

I also don't care.

Like even though we have great renditions

of all the best songs, as I said,

there are millions of people who love to play the guitar.

It may no longer have as much economic value as it once did.

I think that I'm quite convinced is true

that we perhaps have seen the peak.

Now I understand the paradox,

when the price of something goes down,

actually the overall usage goes up

and total spend on that activity goes up.

That could also happen maybe.

But what we're seeing right now

is that a lot of the big shops, a lot of the big companies

are not hiring like they were five years ago.

They're not anticipating they're gonna need

tons more programmers.

Controversially, Tobi actually put out a memo

inside of Shopify asking everyone

who's considering hiring someone

to ask the question, could this be done by AI?

Now, he's further ahead on this question than I am.

I look at some of the coding trenches

and I go like, I'd love to use AI more,

and I see how it's making us more productive,

but it's not yet at the level

where I just go like, oh, we have this project.

Let me just give it to the AI agent

and it's gonna go off and do it.

- But let's just be honest.

You're like a Clint-Eastwood type character cowboy

and on a horse seeing cars going around

and you're like, well.

- That's part of it.

And I think that's, it is important to have that humility

that what you are good at

may no longer be what society values.

This has happened a million times in history

that you could have been exceptionally good

at saddle making, for example.

That's something that a lot of people used to care about

because everyone rode a horse.

And then suddenly riding a horse became this niche hobby

that there's some people care about it,

but not nearly as many.

That's okay.

Now the other thing of this

is I've had the good fortune to...

I've been a programmer for nearly 30 years.

That was a great run.

I try to look at life in this way

that I've already been blessed

with decades of economically viable,

highly valuable ways of translating what I like best

in the working world to write Ruby code.

That that was so valuable

that I could make millions and millions of dollars doing it.

And if that's over tomorrow,

I shouldn't look at that with regret.

I should look at it with gratitude.

- But you're also a highly experienced, brilliant

and opinionated human being,

so it's really interesting to get your opinion

on the future of the horse

because it, you know,

there's a lot of young people listening to this

who love programming or who are excited

by the possibility of building stuff with software,

with Ruby on Rails, that kind of language.

This and now the possibility.

- But is it a career? - Is it a career?

And if indeed a single person can build

more and more and more with the help of AI,

like how do they learn that skill?

Is this a good skill to learn?

I mean, that to me is the real mystery here,

because I think it's still absolutely true

that you have to learn how to program

from scratch currently.

But how do you balance those two skills?

Because I too, as I'm thinking now,

there is a scary slipping away of skill that happens.

In a matter of like really minutes

on a particular piece of code.

It's scary.

Not the way driving, you know,

when you have a car drive for you

doesn't quite slip away that fast.

So that really scares me.

So when somebody comes up to me

and asks me like, how do I learn to program,

I don't know what the advice

is because I think it's not enough

to just use cursor or copilot to generate code.

- It's absolutely not enough.

Not if you wanna learn,

none of you want to become better at it.

If you just become a tap monkey,

maybe you're productive in a second.

But then you have to realize,

well, can anyone just tap?

If that's all we're doing

is just sitting around all day long tapping?

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

That's not a marketable skill.

Now, I always preface this both to myself

and when I speak to others,

it is rule number note one, nobody fucking knows anything.

No one can predict even six months ahead.

Right now, we're probably at peak AI future hype

because we see all the promise,

because so much of it is real

and so many people have experienced it themselves.

This mind boggling thing

that the silicon is thinking in some way

that feels eerily reminiscent of humans.

I'd actually say the big thing

for me wasn't even ChatGPT.

It wasn't even Claude.

It was DeepSeek.

Running DeepSeek locally

and seeing the think box

where it converses with itself

about how to formulate the response.

I almost wanted to think, is this a gimmick?

Is it doing this as a performance for my benefit?

But that's not actually how it thinks.

If this is how it actually thinks,

okay, I'm a little scared.

This is incredibly human how it thinks in this way.

But where does that go?

So in '95, 1 of my favorite movies,

one of my favorite B movies came out,

"The Lawnmower Man." - Great movie.

- Incredible movie about virtual reality.

Being an avatar and living in VR,

like the story was a mess.

But the aesthetics the world had built up was incredible.

# Chapter 8

It wasn't even Claude.

It was DeepSeek.

Running DeepSeek locally

and seeing the think box

where it converses with itself

about how to formulate the response.

I almost wanted to think, is this a gimmick?

Is it doing this as a performance for my benefit?

But that's not actually how it thinks.

If this is how it actually thinks,

okay, I'm a little scared.

This is incredibly human how it thinks in this way.

But where does that go?

So in '95, 1 of my favorite movies,

one of my favorite B movies came out,

"The Lawnmower Man." - Great movie.

- Incredible movie about virtual reality.

Being an avatar and living in VR,

like the story was a mess.

But the aesthetics the world had built up was incredible.

And I thought, we're five years away.

I'm gonna be living in VR now.

I'm just gonna be floating around.

I'm gonna be an avatar.

This is where most humans can spend most of the day

that didn't happen.

We're 30 years later,

VR is still not here.

It's here for gaming.

It's here for some specialized applications.

My oldest loves playing Gorilla Tag.

I dunno if you've tried that.

That's basically the hottest VR game.

Wonderful, it's great.

It's really hard to predict the future

'cause we just don't know.

And then when you factor in AI

and you have even the smartest people go like,

I don't think we fully understand how this works.

- But then on the flip side,

you have Moore's Law that seems to have worked

for many, many, many years

in decreasing the size of transistor, for example.

So like you know, Flash didn't take over the internet,

but Moore's Law worked.

So we don't know

which one AI is. - Which one it is.

And this is what I find so fascinating too.

I forget who did this presentation,

but someone in the web community,

this great presentation on the history of the airplane.

So you go from the Wright brothers flying in, what?

1903 or something like that.

And 40 years later you have a jet flight.

Just an unbelievable amount of progress in four decades.

Then in '56, I think it was,

the halt the sign for the Boeing 747

essentially precursor was designed

and basically nothing has happened since.

Just minor tweaks and improvements

on the flying experience since the '50s.

Somehow, if you were to predict where flying

was gonna go, and you were sitting in 42

and you'd seen, you'd remember

the Wright brothers flying in '03,

and you were seeing that jet engines coming,

you're like, we're gonna fly to to the stars

in another two decades.

We're gonna invent super mega hypersonic flights

that's gonna traverse the earth in two hours.

And then that didn't happen.

It tapped out.

This is what's so hard about predicting the future.

We can be so excited in the moment

because we're drawing a line through early dots on a chart,

and it looks like those early dots

are just going up into the right,

and sometimes it's just flatten out.

This is also one of those things

where we have so much critical infrastructure, for example,

that still runs on COBOL.

That about five humans

around the world really understand truly, deeply

that there's a lot, it's possible

for society to lose a competence.

It's still needs because it's chasing the future.

COBOL is still with us.

This is one of the things I think about

with with programming.

Ruby on Rails is at such a level now

that in 50 years from now,

it's exceedingly likely that there's still a ton

of Ruby on Rail systems running around.

And very hard to predict

what that exact world is gonna be like.

But yesterday's weather tells us

that if there's still COBOL code from the '70s

operating social security today,

and we haven't figured out a clean way to convert that,

let alone understand it,

we should certainly be humble about predicting the future.

I don't think any of the programmers

who wrote that COBOL code back in the '70s

had any damn idea that in 2025,

checks were still being cut off the business logic

that they had encoded back then.

But that just brings me to the conclusion on the question

for what should a young programmer do?

You're not gonna be able to predict the future.

No one's gonna be able to predict the future.

If you like programming, you should learn programming.

Now, is that gonna be a career forever?

I don't know, but what's gonna be a career forever?

Who knows?

Like a second ago,

we thought that it was the blue collar labor

that was gonna be extracted first.

It was the robots that were gonna take over.

Then GenAI comes out,

and then all the artists suddenly look like,

"Holy shit, is this gonna do all animation now?

Is gonna do all music now?"

They get real scared.

And now I see the latest Tesla robot going like,

oh, maybe we're back now to blue collar being in trouble.

Because if it can dance like that,

it can probably fix a toilet.

So no one knows anything,

and you have to then position yourself for the future

in such a way that it doesn't matter

that you pick a profession or path

where if it turns out that you have to retool and re-skill,

you're not gonna regret the path you took.

That's a general life principle.

For me, how I look at all endeavors I involve myself in

is I want to be content with all outcomes.

When we start working on a new product at 37signals,

I set up my mental model for its success.

And I go, do you know what?

If no one wants this, I will have had another opportunity

to write beautiful Ruby code,

to explore Greenfield domain,

to learn something new,

to build a system I want, even if no one else wants it.

What a blessing.

What a privilege.

If a bunch of people want it, that's great.

We can pay some salaries, we can keep the business running,

and if it's a blow away success, wonderful.

I get to impact a bunch of people.

- I think one of the big open questions to me

is how far you can get with vibe coding,

whether an approach for a young developer to invest

most of the time it's into vibe coding

or into writing code from scratch.

So vibe coding, meaning,

so I'm leaning into the meme a little bit,

but the vibe coding, meaning you generate code,

you have this idea of a thing you want to create,

you generate the code and then you fix it

with both natural language to the prompts and manually.

You learn enough to manually fix it.

So that's the learning process.

How you fix code that's generated,

or you write code from scratch

and have the LMS kind of tab, tab, tab, tab,

add extra code.

Like which part do you lean on?

I think to be safe, you should find the beauty

and the artistry and the skill

in both right from scratch.

So like there should be some percent

of your time just writing from scratch

and some percent vibe coding.

- There should be more of the time writing from scratch.

If you are interested in learning how to program,

unfortunately you're not gonna get fit

by watching fitness videos.

You're not gonna learn how to play the guitar

by watching YouTube guitar videos.

You have to actually play yourself.

You have to do the sit ups.

Programming, understanding,

learning almost anything requires you to do.

Humans are not built to absorb information

in a way that transforms into skills

by just watching others from afar.

Now ironically, it seems AI is actually quite good at that,

but humans are not.

If you wanna learn how to become a competent programmer,

you have to program.

It's really not that difficult to understand.

Now I understand the temptation.

And the temptation is there

because vibe coding can produce things.

Perhaps in this moment,

especially in a new domain you're not familiar with,

with tools you don't know perfectly well,

that's better than what you could do.

Or that you would take much longer to get at,

but you're not gonna learn anything.

You're gonna learn in this superficial way

that feels like learning,

but is completely empty calories.

And secondly, if you can just vibe code it,

you're not a programmer.

Then anyone could do it, which may be wonderful.

That's essentially what happened with the Access database.

That's what happened with Excel.

It took the capacity of accountants

to become software developers

because the tools became so accessible to them

that they could build a model

for how the business was gonna do next week.

That required a programmer prior to Excel.

Now it didn't because they could do it themselves

by coding enables non-programmers

to explore their ideas

in a way that I find absolutely wonderful.

But it doesn't make your a programmer.

- I agree with you, but I wanna allow for room

for both of us to be wrong.

For example, there could be,

vibe coding could actually be a skill.

That if you train it, and by vibe coding,

let's include the step of correction,

the iterative correction.

It's possible if you get really good at that,

that you're outperforming the people that run from scratch,

that you can come up with truly innovative things,

especially at this moment in history.

While the LLMs are a little bit too dumb

to create super novel things and a complete product,

but they're starting to creep close to that.

So if you are investing time now

into becoming a really good vibe coder,

maybe this is the right thing to do

as if it's indeed a skill,

we kind of meme about vibe coding,

just like sitting back and it's in the name.

But if you treat it seriously,

a competitive vibe coder

and get good at riding the wave of AI

and get good at the skill of editing code

versus writing code from scratch, it's possible

that you can actually get farther in the long term.

Maybe editing is a fundamentally different task

than writing from scratch

if you take that seriously as a skill that you develop.

To me that's an open question.

I just think, I personally, now you're on another level,

but just me, just personally,

I'm not as good at editing the code that I didn't write.

- No one is. - That's one different.

- No one is of this generation,

but maybe that's a skill.

Maybe if you get on the same page as the AI,

'cause there's a consistency to the AI.

It's like it really is a pair programmer

with a consistent style and structure and so on.

Plus with your own prompting,

you can control the kind of wrote code you write.

I mean, it could generally be a skill like.

- That's the dream of the prompt engineer.

I think it's complete pipe dream.

I don't think editors exist

that aren't good at writing.

I've written a number of books.

I've had a number of professional editors.

Not all of them wrote their own great books,

but all of them were great writers in some regard.

You cannot give someone pointers

if you don't know how to do it.

It's very difficult for an editor

to be able to spot what's wrong with a problem

if you that it couldn't make the solution themselves.

Editing, in my opinion, is the reward,

the capacity to be a good editor

is the reward you get from being a good doer.

You have to be a doer first.

Now that's not the same as saying that vibe coding,

prompt engineering won't be able to produce

fully formed amazing systems even shortly.

I think that's entirely possible,

but then there's no skill left,

which maybe is the greatest payoff at all.

Wasn't that the whole promise of AI anyway,

that it was just all natural language

that even my clumsy way of formulating a question

could result in a beautiful, succinct answer.

That actually to me is a much more appealing vision

that there's gonna be these special

prompt engineering wizards

who know how to tickle the AI

just write to produce what they want.

The beauty of AI is to think that someone

who doesn't know the first thing about

how AI actually works is able to formulate their idea

and their aspirations for what they want,

and the AI could somehow take that messy clump of ideas

and produce something that someone wants.

That's actually what programming has always been.

There's very often been people

who didn't know how to program, who wanted programs,

who then hired programmers,

who gave them messy descriptions of what they wanted

and then when the programmers delivered that back said,

"Oh no, actually that's not what I meant.

I want something else."

AI may be able to provide that cycle.

If that happens to the fullest extent of it,

yeah, there's not gonna be

as many programmers around, right?

But hopefully presumably someone still,

at least for the foreseeable future,

have to understand whether what the AI is producing

actually works or not.

- As a interesting case study,

maybe a thought experiment.

If I wanted to vibe code Basecamp or HEY,

and some of the products you've built,

like what would be the bottleneck?

Where would I fail along the way?

- What I've seen when I've been trying to do this,

trying to use vibe coding to build something real

is you actually failed really early.

The vibe coding is able to build a veneer

at the current present moment

of something that looks like it works, right?

But it's flawed in all sorts of ways.

There are the obvious ways, the meme ways

that it's leaking all your API keys,

it's storing your password in plain text.

I think that's ultimately solvable.

Like it's gonna figure that out

or at least it's gonna get better at that,

but its capacity to get lost in its own labyrinth

is very great right now.

It code something and then you wanna change something

and it becomes a game of whack-a-mole.

Real quick, Pieter Levels who've been doing this wonderful

flight simulator was talking to that

where at a certain scale,

the thing just keeps biting its own tail.

You wanna fix something

and it breaks five other things,

which I think is actually uniquely human

because that's how most bad programmers are.

At the certain level of complexity with the domain,

they can't fix one thing

without breaking three other things.

So in that way I'm actually

in some way it's almost a positive signal

for that the AI is gonna figure this out

because it's done an extremely human trajectory right now.

The kind of mistakes it's making

are the kind of mistakes the junior programmers

make all the time.

- Yeah, can we zoom out and look at the vision,

the manifesto, the doctrine of Rails?

What are some of the things

that make a programming language a framework great?

Especially for web development.

So we talked about happiness.

The underlying objective of Ruby.

What else?

- So you're looking at the nine points I wrote out

in I think 2012.

And first, before we dive into 'em,

I wanna say the reason I wrote it down

is that if you want a community to endure,

you have to record its values

and you have to record its practices.

If you don't, eventually you're gonna get enough

new people come in who have their own ideas

of where this thing should go.

And if we don't have a a guiding light

helping us to make decisions, we're gonna start flailing.

We're gonna start actually falling apart.

I think this is one of the key reasons

that institutions of all kinds start falling apart.

We forget why Chesterton's Fence is there.

We just go like, why is that fence there?

Let's yank it out.

Oh, it was to keep the wolves out.

Now we're all dead, oops.

So I wanted to write these things down.

And if we just take them quick one by one,

you talked about optimizing for programmer happiness.

I put that at number one in homage of Matz,

and that's a lot about accepting

that there is occasionally a trade off

between writing beautiful code

and other things we want out of systems.

# Chapter 9

new people come in who have their own ideas

of where this thing should go.

And if we don't have a a guiding light

helping us to make decisions, we're gonna start flailing.

We're gonna start actually falling apart.

I think this is one of the key reasons

that institutions of all kinds start falling apart.

We forget why Chesterton's Fence is there.

We just go like, why is that fence there?

Let's yank it out.

Oh, it was to keep the wolves out.

Now we're all dead, oops.

So I wanted to write these things down.

And if we just take them quick one by one,

you talked about optimizing for programmer happiness.

I put that at number one in homage of Matz,

and that's a lot about accepting

that there is occasionally a trade off

between writing beautiful code

and other things we want out of systems.

There could be a runtime trade off,

there can be a performance trade off,

but we're gonna do it nonetheless.

We're also going to allow ambiguity

in a way that many programmers, by default,

are uncomfortable with.

I give the example actually here

of in the interactive Ruby shell

where you can play with the language

or even interact with your domain model.

You can quit it in two ways, at least that I found.

You can write exit.

Boom, you're out of the program.

You can write quit.

Boom, you're out of the program.

They do the same thing.

We just wrote both exit

or the people who built that wrote both exit and quit

because they knew humans were likely

to pick one or the other.

Python is the perfect contrast to this.

In the Python interactive protocol,

if you write exit, it won't exit.

It'll give you a lesson.

It'll basically tell you to read the fucking manual.

It says use exit parentheses

or Ctrl-D i.e. end of file to exit.

I'm like, one is very human and another is very engineer.

And I mean that both of them in the best possible way.

Python is pedantic.

Python is the value from the start stated

is that there should be preferably one

and only one way to do a certain thing.

Ruby is the complete opposite.

No, we want the full expression

that fits different human brains,

such that it seems like the language

is guessing just what they want.

- And part of that is also described

the principle of least surprise,

which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language

because you have to kind of, it's a subjective thing.

- Which is why you can't do it in one way,

which is why I used the example of both exit and quit.

The principle of least surprise

for some people would be like, "Oh, exit.

That's how I get out of the prompt."

For other people it'd be quit.

Why don't we just do both?

- Okay, so what's the convention over configuration?

That's a big one.

- That's a big one.

That's a huge one.

And it was born out of a frustration

I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks

where when you were setting up a web application framework

for Java back in the day,

it was not uncommon to literally

write hundreds if not thousands of lines

of XML configuration files.

Oh, I need this.

I want the database to use the foreign keys

as post_id.

No, no, no, I wanted as post capital ID.

Oh, no, no, no, you have to do it capital PID.

There are all these ways

where you can configure how foreign relation keys

should work in a database and none of them matter.

We just need to pick one, and then that's fine.

And if we pick one and we can depend on it,

it becomes a convention.

And if it's a convention, we don't have to configure it.

And if we don't have to configure it,

you can get started with you actually care

about much quicker.

So convention over configuration

is essentially to take that idea

that the system should come preassembled.

I'm not just handing you a box of fucking Legos

and asking you to build the Millennium Falcon.

I'm giving you a finished toy.

You can edit, you can change it,

it's still build out a Legos.

You can still take some pieces off

and put in some other pieces,

but I'm giving you the final product.

And this cuts against the grain

of what most programmers love.

They love a box of Legos.

They love to put everything together from scratch.

They love to make all these detailed little decisions

that just don't matter at all.

And I want to elevate that up

so that hey, I'm not trying to take the decisions

away from you.

I just want you to focus on decisions

that actually matter that you truly care about.

No one cares about whether it's post_id

or post ID or PID.

- Yeah, great defaults. - Yes.

- It's just a wonderful thing.

You have all these aspirations,

they're gonna do some kind of custom,

most beautiful Legos castle

that nobody's ever built from these pieces.

But in reality to be productive in most situations,

you just need to build the basic thing.

And then on top of that is where your creativity comes.

- Absolutely, and I think this is one of those,

part of the doctrine that a lot of programmers

who get to use Ruby on Rails

begrudgingly will acknowledge it's a nice thing,

even if they don't really like it.

Like it's hard to beat the sort of attraction

to building with Legos from scratch out of programmers.

That's just what we like.

This is why we're programmers in the first place

because we'd like to put these little pieces together,

but we can direct that instinct

towards a more productive end of the stack.

- Okay, what are some of the other ones?

- The menu is omakase.

It actually comes out of the same principle

that great defaults really matter.

If you look at everything

that's wrong with the JavaScript ecosystem right now,

for example, it is that no one is in charge of the menu.

There are a billion different dishes

and you can configure just your tailored specific

configuration of it,

but no one done the work to make sure it all fits together.

So you have all these unique problems

in the JavaScript ecosystem, for example,

there's probably 25 major ways

of just doing the controller layer.

And then as many of how to talk to the database.

So you get this permutation of n times n times n

of no one is using the same thing.

And if they are using the same thing,

they're only using the same thing for about five minutes.

So we have no retained wisdom.

We build up no durable skills.

Rails goes the complete opposite way of saying,

do you know what?

Rails is not just a white framework.

It's a complete attempt at solving the web problem.

It's a complete attempt at solving everything you need

to build a great web application.

And every piece of that puzzle

should ideally be in the box

pre-configured, preassembled.

If you want to change some of those pieces later,

that's wonderful.

But on day one you'll get a full menu

designed by a chef who really cared

about every piece of ingredient and you're gonna enjoy it.

And that's again, one of those things

where many programmers think like I know better.

And they do in some hyper local sense of it.

Every programmer knows better.

This is what Ruby is built on.

That every programmer knows better

in their specific situation.

Maybe they can do something dangerous.

Maybe they think they know better

and then they blow their foot off

and then they truly will know better

because they've blown their foot off once

and won't do it again.

But the the menu of omakase is that.

- So you in general

see the value in the in the monolith?

- Yes, the integrated system.

- Integrated. - That someone thought

of the whole problem.

This is one of the reasons why I've been on a crusade

against microservices since the term was coined.

Microservices was born out of essentially a good idea.

What do you do at Netflix scale

when you have thousands of engineers working

on millions of lines of code?

No one can keep that entire system

in their head at one time. You have to break it down.

Microservices can be a reasonable way to do that.

When you're at Netflix scale,

when you apply that pattern to a team of 20 programmers

working on a code base of half a million lines of code,

you're an idiot.

You just don't need to turn method invocations

into network calls.

It is the first rule of distributed programming.

Do not distribute your programming.

It is makes everything harder.

All the failure conditions

you have to consider as a programmer

just becomes infinitely harder

when there's a network cable involved.

So I hate the idea of premature decomposition

and microservices is exactly that.

The monolith says.

Let's try to focus on building a whole system

that a single human can actually understand

and push that paradigm as far as possible

by compressing all the concepts

such that more of it will fit into memory

of a single operating human.

And then we can have a system

where I can actually understand all the Basecamp.

I can actually understand all of HEY.

Both of those systems

are just over a hundred thousand lines of code.

I've seen people do this that maybe twice,

maybe three times that scale

and then it starts breaking down.

Once you get north of certainly

half a million lines of code,

no individual human can do it

and that's when you get into maybe some degree

of microservices can make sense.

- Basecamp and HEY are both a hundred thousand?

- A hundred thousand lines of code thereabouts.

- Wow, it's small.

- It is.

Considering the fact that Basecamp

I think has something like 420 screens,

different ways and configurations.

- Ah, do you include the front end in that?

- No, that's the Ruby code.

Well, it's front end in the sense

that some of that Ruby codes.

It's beneficial to the front,

but it's not JavaScript for example.

Now the other thing we might talk about later

is we write very little JavaScript actually

for all of our applications.

HEY, which is a Gmail competitor.

Gmail ships I think 28 megabytes

of uncompressed JavaScript.

If you compress it,

I think it's about six megabytes, 28 megabytes.

Think about how many lines of code that is.

When HEY launched, we shipped 40 kilobytes.

It's trying to solve the same problem.

You can solve the email client problem

with either 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript

or with 40 kilobytes if you do things differently.

But that comes through the same problem essentially.

This is why I have fiercely fought

splitting front end and back end apart.

That, in my opinion, this was one of the great crimes

against web development.

That we are still atoning for.

That we separated and divided

what was and should be a unified problem solving mechanism.

When you are working both on front end and back end,

you understand the whole system.

And you're not going to get into these camps

that decompose and eventually you end up with like GraphQL.

- Okay, let's fly through the rest of the doctrine.

No one paradigm.

- No one paradigm goes to the fact that Ruby

is a fiercely object-oriented programming language

at its core, but it's also a functional program language.

This five times I told you about,

you can essentially do these anonymous function calls

and you can chain 'em together very much in the spirit

of how true functional programming languages worked.

Ruby has even moved closer

towards the functional programming

and of the scale by making strings immutable.

There are ideas from all different disciplines

and all different paradigms

of software development that can fit together.

Smalltalk, for example.

With only object oriented,

and that was just it.

Ruby tries to be mainly object oriented,

but borrow a little bit of functional programming,

a little bit of imperative programming,

be able to do all of that.

Rails tries to do the same thing.

We're not just gonna pick one paradigm

and run it through everything.

Object orientation is at the center of it,

but it's okay to invite all these other disciplines

and it's okay to be inspired.

It's okay to remix it.

I actually think one of the main benefits of Rails

is that it's a remix.

I didn't invent all these ideas.

I didn't come up with active record.

I didn't come up with the NBC

way of dividing an application.

I took all the great ideas

that I had learned and picked up from every different camp

and I put it together.

Not because there was gonna be just one single

overarching theory of everything,

but I was gonna have a cohesive unit

that incorporated the best from everywhere.

- Is that idea a bit at tension

with the beauty of the monolith system?

- I think the monolith can be thought of as quite roomy,

quite as a big tent that the monolith needs actually

to borrow a little bit of functional programming

for the kinds of problems that that excels,

that discipline excels at solving,

and that paradigm excels at solving.

If you also want object orientation at its core.

I actually think when I've looked

at functional programming languages,

there's a lot to love.

And then I see some of the crazy contortions

they have to go through

when part of the problem they're solving calls

for mutating something.

And you go like, holy shit,

this is a great paradigm from 90% of the problem.

And then you're twisting yourself completely out of shape

when you try to solve the last 10.

- Ooh, exalt beautiful code is in the next one.

- We've talked about that at length

and here's a great example that really summarizes

the domain specific language quality of Ruby on Rails

that you can make code actually pleasant to write and read.

Which is really funny to me

because as we talked about

when I started learning programming,

it wasn't even a consideration.

I didn't even know that that could be part of the premise,

that could be part of the solution.

That writing code could feel as good as writing a poem.

- class Project, ApplicationRecord

belongs_to :account has many participants.

Class_name, Person, validates_presence_of :name.

- See, you could read it out.

You didn't even change.

- Anything like a haiku or something.

- Right? Isn't that beautiful?

- Yeah, it's nice.

It's really nice.

There's an intuitive nature to it.

Okay, so I have specific questions there.

I mean ActiveRecord, just to take that tangent.

That has to be your favorite feature.

- It's the crown jewel of Rails.

It really is.

It is the defining characteristic

of how to work with Ruby on Rails.

And it's born in an interesting level of controversy,

because it actually uses a pattern

that had been described by Martin Fowler

in the "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture."

One of the greatest books

for anyone working on business systems.

And if you had not read it, you must pick it up immediately.

"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,"

I think it was published in 2001.

It is one of the very few programming books

that I have read many times over.

It's incredible.

In it, Martin describes a bunch of different patterns

of how to build business systems essentially.

And ActiveRecord is a little bit of a footnote in there.

The pattern is literally called active record.

You can look it up. - Nice.

- It's called active record.

I wasn't even creative enough

to come up with a name of my own.

But it allows the creation,

the marriage of database and object orientation

in a way that a lot of programmers

find a little off-putting.

They don't actually want to pollute

the beautiful object-oriented nature

of that kind of programming with SQL.

There was a rant by Uncle Bob the other day about

how SQL is the worst thing ever.

Baba, okay fine, whatever, I don't care.

This is practical.

We are making CRUD applications.

You're taking things out of an HTML form

and you're sticking 'em into a damn database.

It's not more complicated than that.

The more abstractions you put in

between those two ends of the spectrum,

the more you're just fooling yourself.

This is what we're doing.

We're talking to SQL databases.

By the way, quick aside, SQL was one of those things

that have endured the onslaught

of NoSQL databases structured list data

for a better part of a decade

and still reign supreme.

SQL was a good thing to invest your time in learning.

Every program I'm working with the web

should know SQL to a fair degree.

Even if they're working with an ORM,

an optic relational map or as active record.

You still need to understand SQL.

What Active record does

is not so much try to abstract the SQL away

# Chapter 10

and you're sticking 'em into a damn database.

It's not more complicated than that.

The more abstractions you put in

between those two ends of the spectrum,

the more you're just fooling yourself.

This is what we're doing.

We're talking to SQL databases.

By the way, quick aside, SQL was one of those things

that have endured the onslaught

of NoSQL databases structured list data

for a better part of a decade

and still reign supreme.

SQL was a good thing to invest your time in learning.

Every program I'm working with the web

should know SQL to a fair degree.

Even if they're working with an ORM,

an optic relational map or as active record.

You still need to understand SQL.

What Active record does

is not so much try to abstract the SQL away

behind a different kind of paradigm.

It's just making it less cumbersome to write.

Making it more amenable to build

domain models on top of other domain models

in a ways that you don't have to write

every damn SQL statement by hand.

- We'll just say the active record is an ORM,

which is a layer that makes it intuitive

and human interpretable to communicate with a database.

- Even simpler than that.

It turns tables into classes and rows into objects.

I actually think SQL is very easy to understand most of it.

You can write some SQL golf too.

That's very hard to understand.

But SQL at its base,

and much of the criticism against SQL

was it was written for human consumption.

It's actually quite verbose,

especially if you're doing things

like inserts over and over again.

It's quite verbose insert into table parentheses,

enumerate every column you want to insert, values,

parentheses, every value that fits with that column.

It gets tedious to write SQL by hand,

but it's actually very humanly readable.

Active record just takes that tedious away.

It makes it possible to combine things in a way

that a humanly describable language just doesn't.

It composes things into methods

and you can combine these methods

and you can build structures around them.

So I don't dislike SQL,

I dislike a lot of things in programming.

I try to get rid of them.

SQL wasn't really one of them.

It was just a sense of I don't wanna write

the same thing over and over again.

It was a, can we be a little more succinct?

Can we match it just slightly better

to the optic orientation

without trying to hide away the fact

that we're persisting these objects into a database.

That's where I think a lot of ORMs went wrong.

They tried to live in the pure world of objects.

Never to consider that those objects

had to be consistent into a SQL database

and then they came up with convoluted way

of translating back and forth.

Active record says, do you know what?

Just accept it.

This record, this object is not gonna get saved

into some NoSQL database.

It's not gonna be saved.

It's gonna be saved into SQL database.

So it's just structure the whole thing around that.

It's gonna have attributes.

Those attributes are gonna respond

to columns in the database.

It's not more complicated than that stuff making it so.

- Yeah, but I should say, so I personally love SQL

because I'm an algorithms person

and so I love optimization.

I love to know how the databases actually work

so I can match the SQL queries

and the design of the table such that there is, you know,

optimal, squeeze the optimal performance out of the table.

Okay, based on the actual way that that table is used.

So I mean, I think that pushes to the point

that like there is value in learning in understanding SQL.

I wonder, because I started looking at active record

and it looks really awesome.

Does that make you lazy?

Not you, but a person that rolls in

and starts using Rails you can probably get away

with never really learning SQL, right?

- As long as you wanna stay

at the entry level of competence.

And this is actually my overarching mission with Rails

is to lower the barrier of entry so far down

that someone can start seeing stuff

on their browser without basically understanding anything.

Yeah, they can run Rail's new blog,

run a couple of generators, they have a whole system,

they don't understand anything.

But it's an invitation to learn more.

Where I get fired up,

and this ties back to the AI discussion,

is when that's turned into this meme,

that programmers no longer have to be competent.

I mean the AI is gonna figure it out.

The generators is gonna figure it out.

I don't need to know SQL,

active record is gonna abstract it away from me.

No, no, no dude, hold up.

The path here is competence.

I'm trying to teach you things.

I understand I can't teach you everything in five minutes.

No one who's ever become good at anything worthwhile

could be taught everything in five minutes.

If you wanna be a fully

well-rounded web application developer,

that takes years.

But you can actually become somewhat productive

in a few days. You can have fun in a few days for sure.

You're gonna have fun in a a few minutes and a few hours.

And over time, I can teach you a little more.

Active record says like, yeah, yeah.

All right, start to here

and then like next week we'll do a class on SQL.

- And actually you have this beautiful expression

that I love that that a great programming language.

Like Ruby has a soft ramp, the ramp goes to infinity.

- That's exactly right. - So yeah.

It's super accessible, super easy to get started.

- And it never stops.

There's always more to learn.

This is one of the reasons I'm still having fun programming.

That I'm still learning new things.

I can still incorporate new things.

The web is deep enough as a domain.

You're never gonna learn all of it.

- Provide sharp knives. - This is a good one,

because another way of saying this,

the opposite way of saying this,

the Java way of saying is do not provide foot guns, right?

I don't wanna give you sharp knives.

You're a child.

You can't handle a sharp knife.

Here's a dull butter knife.

Cut your damn steak, right?

That's a very frustrating experience.

You want a sharp knife

even though you might be able to cut yourself.

I trust humans in the same way that Matz trust humans.

Maybe you cut off a finger.

All right, you're not gonna do that again.

Thankfully it was a virtual think finger.

It's gonna grow back out.

Your competence is gonna grow.

It's more fun to work with sharp tools.

- And that actually contributes

to the the ramp that goes to infinity.

- Yes, to the learning

- Value integrated systems. - We kind of hit on that one.

This is Rails is trying to solve the whole problem

of the web, not just one little component.

It's not leaving you a bunch of pieces.

You have to put together yourself.

- Progress over stability.

- You know what?

If there's one that's dated,

it's probably that one.

At this stage, Rails has been incredibly stable

over many, many generations.

The last major release Rails 8

was basically a no upgrade

for anyone running Rail 7.

Rail 7 was almost a no upgrade

for anyone running Rail 6.

I used to think it required more churn

to get progress to stay on the leading edge of new stuff.

And I wrote this before I experienced the indignity

of the 2010s in the JavaScript community.

Where it seemed like stability was not just unvalued,

it was actually despised

that churn in and of itself was a value

we should be pursuing.

If you were still working with the same framework

three months later you were an idiot.

And I saw that and I actually recoiled.

And if I was gonna write the doctrine today,

I'd write that differently.

I wouldn't say progress over stability.

- Well maybe it'd be a function of the age

of the programming language also.

- Maybe, or a deeper understanding of the problem.

I think part of what's so fascinating about technology

is that we have this perception

that everything constantly moves so fast.

No, it doesn't.

Everything moves at a glacial pace.

There is occasionally a paradigm shift

like what's happening with AI right now.

Like what happened with the introduction

of the iPhone in 2007,

like what happened with the internet in '95.

That's basically the total sum of my career.

Three things changed.

Everything else in between

was incremental small improvements.

You can recognize a Rails application written in 2003.

I know because the Basecamp I wrote back then

is still operating, making millions of dollars in ARR,

servings in customers on the initial version

that was launched back then.

And it looks like the Rails code

if I squint a little that I would write today.

So most things don't change even in computing.

And that's actually a good thing.

We saw with the JavaScript ecosystem.

What happens when everyone

gets just mad about constant churn?

Things don't change that often.

- By the way, on that small tangent.

You just sort of visibly, verbally changed your mind

with the you of 15 years ago.

- Yes. - That's interesting.

Have you noticed yourself changing your mind

quite a bit over the years?

- I would say, oh yes.

And then also, oh no,

in the sense that there are absolutely fundamental things

both about human nature,

about institutions, about programming,

about business that I've changed my mind on.

And then I've also had experiences

that are almost even more interesting

where I thought I had changed my mind

and I tried it a new way,

realized why I had the original opinion in the first place

and then gone back to it.

So it happens both ways.

An example of the later part, for example,

was managers at 37signals.

For the longest time,

I would Rail against engineering managers

as an unnecessary burden

on a small or even medium sized company.

And at one point I actually started

doubting myself a little bit.

I started thinking like, do you know what?

Maybe all programmers do need a one-on-one therapy session

every week with their engineering manager

to be a whole individual.

So we tried that for a couple years

where we hired some very good engineering managers

who did engineering management

the way you're supposed to do it,

the way it's done all over the place.

And after that I thought like, no, no, I was right.

This was correct.

We should not have had managers.

Not every programmer needs a therapy session

with an engineering manager every week.

We don't need these and least scheduled huddles.

We don't need all these meetings.

We just need to leave people the hell alone

to work on problems that they enjoy

for long stretches of uninterrupted time.

That is where happiness is found.

That's where productivity is found.

And if you can get away with it, you absolutely should.

Engineering management is a necessary evil

when that breaks down.

- What's the case for managers then?

- The case for managers

is that if you do have a lot of people.

There's a bunch of work that kind of just crops up.

The one-on-one is one example

that programmers need someone to check in with.

There's another idealized version that someone needs

to guide the career of juniors, for example,

to give them redirecting feedback

and all this other stuff.

And it's not that in the abstract,

I don't agree with some of those things,

but in practice I've found

that they often create more problems that they solve.

And a good example here is can you get feedback

from someone who's not better at your job than you are?

You get some feedback.

You can get feedback on how you show up at work.

Are you being courteous to others?

Are you being a good communicator?

Okay, yes. But you can't get feedback on your work

and that's more important.

It's more important that you work

under and with someone who's better at your job

than you are if you wish to progress in your career.

And every single programmer I've ever worked with

was far more interested in progressing

in their career on that metric,

getting better at their craft

than they were in picking up pointers

that a middle manager could teach them.

That's not saying that there isn't value in it.

It's not saying there isn't value

in being a better person or a better communicator.

Of course there is all those things.

But if I have to choose one or the other,

I value competence higher.

Like that's again, I caveat this a million times

because I know what people sometimes hear.

They hear the genius asshole

is just fine and that's great

and you should excuse all sorts of malicious behavior

if someone's just really good at what they do.

I'm not saying that at all.

What I am saying is that the history of competence

is a history of learning

from people who are better than you,

and that relationship should take precedence over all else

and that relationship gets put aside a bit

when engineering managers introduced.

Now the funny thing is this conversation

ties back to the earlier things we were talking about.

Most engineering managers are actually former programmers.

They at least no program to some extent,

but what I've seen time and again

is that they lose their touch,

their feel with it very, very quickly

and turn into pointy haired bosses very, very quickly

who are really good at checking for updates.

Just seeing where we are on project A here

if you need anything or we ready to deliver.

Okay, yes.

And also, no.

Shut up, leave me the hell alone.

Let me program and then I'll come up for error.

I'll talk with other programmers

who I can spar with that we can learn something with.

I can turn the problems over with and we can move forward.

If you look back on the history of computer industry,

all the great innovation that's happened,

it's all been done by tiny teams

with no engineering managers.

Just full of highly skilled individuals.

You've had John Carmack on here.

I used to look up to its software so much.

Not just because I loved quick,

not just because I loved what they were doing,

but because he shared a bit about how the company worked.

There were no managers or maybe they had one business guy

doing some business stuff, but that was just to get paid.

Everything else was basically

just designers and programmers.

And there were about eight of them

and they created goddamn "Quake II."

So why do you need all these people again?

Why do you need all these managers again?

I think, again, at a certain scale it does break down.

It's hard to just have a hundred thousand programmers

running around wild without any

product mommies or daddies telling them what to do.

I understand that.

And then even as I say that, I also don't understand it.

Yeah, because if you look at something

like Gmail, for example,

there was like a side project done by Buchheit

at Google at the time.

So much of the enduring long-term value

of even all these huge companies

were created by people who didn't have a manager.

And that's not an accident,

that's a direct cause and effect.

So I've turned in some way even more militant

over the years against this notion of management,

at least for myself

and knowing who I am and how I wanna work.

Because the other part of this

is I don't want to be a manager,

and maybe this is just me projecting the fact

that I'm an introvert who don't like to talk

to people on one-on-one calls every week.

But it also encapsulates

how I was able to progress my career.

I did not really go to the next level with Ruby

or otherwise until I had a door I could close

and no one could bother me for six hours straight.

- So in companies probably one of the reasons

is it's very easy to hire managers,

and managers also delegate responsibility from you.

So if you just have a bunch of programmers running around,

you're kind of response like it's work,

it's intellectual work to have to deal

with the the first principles

of every problem that's going on.

So managers like you can like relax,

oh I'll be taken care of.

But they then hire their own managers

and it just multiplies and multiplies and multiplies.

I would love it if some of the great companies

would have in the United States,

if there was like an extra side branch

that we could always run,

maybe physicists can come up how to split the simulation

to where just all the managers are removed.

Also just in that branch,

just the PR and the comms people also.

to where just all the managers are removed.

Also just in that branch,

just the PR and the comms people also.

And even the lawyers, just the engineers

and let's just see and then we merge it back.

- I've essentially run that branch

at 37signals for 20 years.

And I've experimented with forking back on the other side.

I've experimented with having a full-time lawyer on staff.

I've experimented with having engineering managers.

And I can tell you life is much better

at 50, 60 people when none of those individuals

or none of those roles.

It's never about the individuals.

It's about the roles.

None of those roles are in your organization fulltime.

Occasionally you need a manager.

Occasionally you need a lawyer.

I can play the role of manager occasionally, fine.

And then I can set it back down to zero.

It's almost like a cloud surface.

I wanna a manager service

I can call on for seven hours this week

and then I wanna take it down to zero

for the next three months.

- Yeah. I read. I don't know if this is still the case,

that Basecamp is an LLC and doesn't have a CFO,

like a full-time accountant.

Was that upgrade? - So the funniest.

These days, we do have a head of finance.

We did not for the first 19 years of life, I think.

We got away with basically

just an accountant do our books

in the same way you would do a small ice cream shop,

except we would over time have done

hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

The scale seemed quirky.

And at some point, you can also fall in love

with your own quirkiness

to a degree that isn't actually healthy.

And I've certainly done that over time

and we should have had someone mount

or count the beans

a little more diligently, a little earlier.

This was part of a blessing

of just being wildly profitable and selling software

that can have infinite margins basically

that you kind of can get away with a bunch of stuff

that you perhaps shouldn't.

What partially taught me this lesson

was when we realized we had not been collecting sales tax

in different US states where we had Nexus.

And it took us about two years

and $5 million in settlements

and cleanups to get out of that mess.

And after that I went like,

okay, fine, we can hire a finance person.

And we now have a wonderful finance person, Ron,

who actually ended up replacing something else.

We used to have a full-time data analytics

person who would do all sorts of insight mining

for why are people signing up for this thing.

We ran that for 10 years

and realized, you know what?

If I can have either a data analytics person

or an accountant, I'm picking the accountant.

- I love this so much on so many levels.

Can we just linger on that advice that you've given

that small teams are better?

I think that's really less.

Less is more.

What did you say before?

Worse is better.

Okay, I'm sorry.

- Worse better on adoption with technology

a lot of times.

And I think actually comes out at the same thing.

It comes out of the fact

that many of the great breakthroughs

are created by not even just tiny teams but individuals.

Individuals writing something.

And an individual writing something on some parameter,

what they do is worse.

Of course it's worse when one person has to make something

that a huge company have hundreds

if not thousands of developers

that they can have work on that problem.

But in so many other parameters

that worseness is the value,

that less is the value.

In getting real, which we wrote back in 2006.

We talk about this notion of less software.

When we first got started with Basecamp back in 2004,

people would ask us all the time,

aren't you petrified of Microsoft?

They have so many more resources.

They have so many more programmers.

What if they take a liking to your little niche here

and they show up

and they just throw a thousand programmers at the problem?

And my answer perhaps partly

because I was like 24 was first of all,

no, no care in the world.

But the real answer

was they're not gonna produce the same thing.

You cannot produce the kind of software that Basecamp is

with a team of a thousand people.

You will build the kind of software

that a thousand people builds.

And that's not the same thing at all.

So much of the main breakthrough

in both end user systems

but also in open source systems

and fundamental systems,

they're done by individuals or very small teams.

Even all these classical histories of Apple

has always been like, well it was a big organization

but then you had the team

that was actually working on the breakthrough.

It was four people.

It was eight people.

It was never 200.

- And large teams seems to slow things down.

- Yes. - It's so fascinating

and part of it's the manager thing.

- Because humans don't scale.

Communication between humans certainly don't scale.

You basically get the network cost effect

every time you add a new node, it goes up exponentially.

This is perhaps the key thing

of why I get to be so fond

of having no managers at Basecamp,

because our default team size is two.

One programmer, one designer, one feature.

When you're operating at that level of scale,

you don't need sophistication.

You don't need advanced methodologies.

You don't need multiple layers of management

because you can just do.

The magic of small teams is that they just do.

They don't have to argue

because we don't have to set direction,

we don't have to worry about the roadmap.

We can just sit down and make something

and then see if it's good.

When you can get away with just making things,

you don't have to plan.

And if you can get out of planning,

you can follow the truth

that emerges from the code, from the product,

from the thing you're working on in the moment.

You know far more about

what the great next step is,

when you're one step behind

rather than if you try 18 months in advance

to map out all the steps.

How do we get from here to very far away?

You know what?

That's difficult to imagine in advance

because humans are very poor at that.

Maybe AI one day will be much better than us,

but humans can take one foot

or put one foot in front of each other.

That's not that hard and that allows you

to get away with all that sophistication.

So the process has become much simpler.

You need far fewer people, it compounds.

You need much less process.

You need to waste less time in meetings.

You can just spend these long glorious days

and weeks of uninterrupted time

solving real problems you care about and that are valuable

and you're gonna find

that's what the market actually wants.

No one is buying something

because there's a huge company behind it.

Most of the time.

They're buying something because it's good.

And the way you get something good

is you don't sit around and have a meeting about it.

You try stuff.

You build stuff.

- It really is kind of incredible what one person,

honestly one person can do in 100 hours

of deep work of focused work, even less.

- So I'll tell you this,

I tracked exactly the number of hours

I spent on the first version of Basecamp.

And I was doing this because at the time

I was working on a contract basis for Jason,

he was paying me, I was gonna say $15 an hour.

That's what I got paid when we first got started.

I think he had bumped my pay to a glorious 25.

But I was billing him

and I know that the invoice

for the first vision of Basecamp was 400 hours.

That's what it took for one sole individual in 2004

to create an entire system that has then gone

on to gross hundreds of millions of dollars

and continues to do extremely well.

One person just me setting up everything.

Part of that story is Ruby.

Part of that story is Rails.

But a lot of it is also just me plus Jason,

plus Ryan, plus Matt.

That was the entire company at the time.

And we could create something of sheer sustaining value

with such a tiny team, because we were a tiny team.

Not to spite off.

Small is not a stepping stone.

This is the other thing that people get into their head.

This is one of the big topics of "Rework."

That it gave entrepreneurs

the permission to embrace being a small team.

Not as a way point, not as like I'm trying

to become a thousand people.

No, I actually like being a small team.

Small teams are more fun.

If you ask almost anyone,

I'm sure Tobi would say this too,

even at his scale,

the sheer enjoyment of building something

is in the enjoyment of building it with a tiny team.

Now you can have impact at a different scale

when you have a huge company.

I fully recognize that and I see the appeal of it.

But in the actual building of things,

it's always small teams, always.

- How do you protect the small team.

Basecamp has successfully stayed small.

Has been the dragon, and you had to fight off.

That like basically you make a lot of money.

There's a temptation to grow.

So how do you not grow?

- Don't take venture capital.

- Okay, that's step one. - That is point number one.

- First of all, - Point number two

everybody takes venture capital.

So you already went.

- I mean that's been the answer for the longest time.

Because the problem isn't just venture capital,

it's other people's money.

Once you take other people's money,

completely understandably, they want a return

and they would prefer to have the largest return possible.

'Cause not them sitting in the code.

It's not them getting the daily satisfaction

out of building something.

Chiseling beautiful code poems out of the editor, right?

They don't get that satisfaction.

They get the satisfaction maybe of seeing

something nice put into the world, that's fair.

But they certainly also get a satisfaction

of a higher return.

And there is this sense certainly in venture capital,

stated in venture capital

that the whole point of you taking the money

is to get to a billion dollars or more.

Now the path to that

usually does go through running established playbooks

and then when it comes to software,

the enterprise sales playbook is that playbook.

If you're doing B2B software SaaS,

you will try to find product market fit.

And the second you have it,

you will abandon your small and medium sized accounts

to chase the big whales with a huge sales force

and by then you're a thousand people and life sucks.

- That said, I mean people are just curious about this.

I've gotten a chance to get to know Jeff Bezos.

He invested in Basecamp, not controlling?

- He bought secondaries.

So this was the funny thing

is that when investing have these two dual meanings.

Normally when people think about investing,

they think you're putting in growth capital

because you want the business to hire more people

to do more R&Ds so they can grow bigger.

Bezos didn't do that actually.

He bought a ownership stake directly from Jason and I,

and 100% of the proceeds of that purchase

went into my and Jason's bank account,

personal bank account.

Not a single cent went into the account of the company

'cause we didn't need the money to grow.

What we needed or what we certainly enjoyed

was to some extent maybe the vote of confidence,

but more so the security

of taking a little bit off the table

is that we dare turn down the big bucks

from venture capitals.

It was essentially a vaccine

against wanting to take a larger check

from people who then wanted to take the company

to something enormous that we didn't want to go with it.

So Jeff gave Jason and I just enough money

that we were comfortable turning all these people down

in a way where if it had turned belly up

like six months later,

we wouldn't have been kicking ourselves

and going, we had something here that was worth millions

and now we have nothing

and I have to worry about rent and groceries again.

- It is a vote of confidence.

I wonder from, I'd love to hear Jeff's side of the story

of like why, 'cause he doesn't need like the money.

So it's really,

I think it probably is just believing in people

and wanting to have cool stuff be created in the world

and make money off of it, but not like.

- 100% the motivation for Jeff wasn't a return,

because he actually has a team.

He's private office that runs these investments

who did the calculus on the investment pitch we gave him,

which was so ridiculous

that Jason and I were laughing our asses off

when we were writing down our metrics.

I was like, no one's gonna pay this.

No one is gonna give us this multiple

of this amount of revenue.

And that's fine.

I mean we took the call

essentially out of kind of an awe

that Jeff Bezos even wanted to look at us and like,

do you know what?

We don't want venture capital.

We don't need other people's money,

but like let's just give him a bullshit number

that no sane person would actually say yes to.

And then I mean, we can each go our own way.

And his investment team said like, "Jeff, no way.

This makes no economic sense at all.

They're asking for way too much money

with way too little revenue."

And Jeff just went like, "I don't care.

I wanna invest in this guy."

Because to him at the time it was chump change, right?

Like Jason and I each got a few million dollars.

I mean whatever the currency swing

between the yen and the dollar

that day probably moved 10 x

that for his net worth than our investment did.

Jeff seemed genuinely interested

in being around interesting people,

interesting companies, helping someone go to distance.

And I actually look back on that relationship

with some degree of regret,

because I took that vote of confidence for granted

in ways that I'm a little bit ashamed of

over the years I've been more critical about

some of the things that Amazon had done

that I feel now is sort of justified.

So that's just sort of part of that processing of it.

But on the economic sense,

he gave us that confidence.

He gave us the economic confidence,

but then he also gave us the confidence of a CEO running

perhaps at the time the most important

internet business in the US.

Showing up to our calls,

which we would have with him like once a year

and basically just going like, yeah,

you guys are doing awesome stuff.

You should just keep doing awesome stuff.

I read your book, it's awesome.

You launched this thing, it's awesome.

You should just do more of that.

I don't actually know how to run your business.

You guys know it.

- So the book goes out.

I'm just so, from a fan perspective,

I'm curious about how Jeff Bezos was able to see,

'cause to me, you and Jason,

like especially humans in the space of tech.

And the fact that Jeff was able to see that, right?

How hard is it to see that?

- He certainly saw it very early.

And I think this is something that Jeff does better

than almost anyone else.

He spots that opportunity so far in advance

of anyone else even opened their eyes to it,

or certain he is willing to bet on it

far early and far harder than anyone else is.

And he's just right time and again.

I mean, we were not the only investment that he made.

And certainly Amazon had a extremely long-term vision.

So far longer than I have ever had the gumption to keep.

Like I think of myself as a long-term thinker.

I am playing a child's game

compared to the game that Jeff is playing.

Like when I looked at Amazon's economics

around the dot-com boom and bust, they looked ridiculous.

# Chapter 12

'cause to me, you and Jason,

like especially humans in the space of tech.

And the fact that Jeff was able to see that, right?

How hard is it to see that?

- He certainly saw it very early.

And I think this is something that Jeff does better

than almost anyone else.

He spots that opportunity so far in advance

of anyone else even opened their eyes to it,

And certainly Amazon had a extremely long-term vision.

So far longer than I have ever had the gumption to keep.

Like I think of myself as a long-term thinker.

I am playing a child's game

compared to the game that Jeff is playing.

Like when I looked at Amazon's economics

around the dot-com boom and bust, they looked ridiculous.

Like they were losing so much money.

They were so hated by the market they were...

no one believed that it was gonna turn

into what it is, but Jeff did.

In a way that that level of conviction I really aspire to.

And I think that's one of the main things

I've taken away from that relationship

is that you can just believe in yourself

to that degree against those odds.

That's ridiculous.

He did that at so many times our level

that it's pathetic if I'm doubting myself.

- Yeah, I think Amazon is one of those companies.

I mean, it's come under a bunch of criticism

over the years.

This is something about humans

that don't appreciate so much

that we take for granted the positive

that a thing brings real quick

and then we just start criticizing the thing.

It's the Wi-Fi and the airplanes.

- [DHH] That's exactly it.

- But I think Amazon,

there could be a case made that Amazon

is one of the greatest companies

in the last a hundred years

- For sure, I think it's an easy case to make.

What I also think is that the price you pay

to be one of the greatest companies

in the last a hundred years

is a lot of detractors, a lot of pushback,

a lot of criticism

that this is actually order restored in the universe.

One of my favorite teachers in all the time

I've been on the internet is Kathy Sierra.

I don't know if you know her work,

but she was actually Vern a few short years

before the cruel internet ran her off.

But she wrote a blog called Creating Passionate Users

and she carved into my brain

this notion of balance in the universe.

If you are creating something of value

that a lot of people love, you must create an equal

and opposite force of haters.

You cannot have people who love what you do

without also having people who hate what you do.

The only escape from that is mediocrity.

If you are so boring

and so uninteresting that no one gives a damn

whether you exist or not, yeah, you don't get the haters,

but you also don't get the impact of people

who really enjoy your work.

And I think Amazon is that just at the massive scale, right?

They brought so much value and change

to technology to commerce

that they must simply have a black hole size of haters,

otherwise the universe is simply gonna tip over.

- Let me ask you about small teams.

So you mentioned Jason a bunch of times, Jason Fried,

you have been partners for a long, long time.

Perhaps it's fair to say he's more

on the sort of the design business side

and you're like the tech, the engineering wizard.

How have you guys over all these years

creating so many amazing products, not murder each other?

It's a great story of like partnership.

What can you say about collaboration?

What can you say that about Jason that you love

that you've learned from?

Why does this work?

- So first I'll say we have tried

to murder each other several times over the years,

but far less, I think in the last decade.

In the early days,

our product discussions were so fierce

that when we were having them in the office

and there were other employees around,

some of them were legitimately worried

that the company was about to fall apart.

Because the volume coming out of the room

would be so high and sound so acrimonious,

that they were legitimately worried

the whole thing was gonna fall apart.

But you know what's funny

is that it never felt like that in the moment.

It always felt like just a peak vigorous search

for something better.

And that we were able to stomach

that level of adversity on the merits of an idea

because it was about the idea.

It wasn't about the person

and it never really got personal.

Not even never really, it didn't get personal.

It wasn't like, Jason, you're an asshole.

It was like, Jason, you're an idiot.

And you're an idiot

because you're looking at this problem the wrong way.

And let me tell you the right way to do it.

- As a small tangent, let me say this.

Some people have said, oh, probably return to this,

that you're sometimes can have flights of temper

on the internet and so on.

I never take it that way

because it is the same kind of ilk.

Maybe I haven't seen the right kind of traces of temper,

but usually it's about the idea

and it's just excited, passionate human.

- That's exactly what I like to think of it as.

It doesn't always come across as that.

And I can see why spectators in particular sometimes

would see something that looks like I'm going after

the man rather than the ball.

And I do think I've tried to get better at that.

But in my relationship with Jason,

I think it's worked so well

because we have our own distinct areas of competence

where we fully trust each other.

Jason trusts me to make the correct technical decisions.

I trust him to make the correct design

and product direction decisions,

and then we can overlap and share on the business,

on marketing, on writing, on other aspects of it.

So that's one thing is that if you're starting a business

with someone where you do exactly the same as they do

and you're constantly contesting

who's the more competent person,

I think that's far more difficult and far more volatile.

So if you're starting a business

and you're both programmers

and you both work on the same kind of programming,

ah, good luck.

I think that's hard.

I tried to pick an easier path

working with a designer where I knew

that at least half of the time

I could just delegate to his experience and competence

and say like, do you know what?

I may have an opinion,

I have an opinion all the time on design.

But I don't have to win the argument because I trust you.

Now occasionally we would have overlaps

on business or direction

where we'd both feel

like we had a strong stake in the game

and we both had a claim to competence in that area.

But then for whatever reason,

we also both had a long-term vision

were I would go, do you know what?

I think we're wrong here.

But as I learned from Jeff Bezos, by the way,

I'm gonna disagree and commit.

That was one of those early lessons

he gave us that was absolutely crucial

and perhaps even instrumental

in ensuring that Jason and I have been working together

for a quarter of a century.

Disagree and commit

is one of the old time Jeff Bezos greats.

- I'm just surprised that Yoko Ono hasn't come along.

You know what I mean?

Like there's so many Yokos in this world.

- It might have happened.

If not in part because we don't sit on each other's lap

all the time.

Most of our careers,

we haven't even lived in the same city.

Like I lived in Chicago for a couple of years

while we were getting going

after I'd moved to the US in 2005.

But then I moved to Malibu and then I lived in Spain

and then I lived in Copenhagen.

And Jason and I from the foundation of our relationship

learned how to work together

in a remarkably efficient way

where we didn't have to actually talk that much.

On any given week, I'd be surprised

if Jason and I spent more than two hours

of direct exchange and communication.

- Yeah, sometimes it's the basic human frictions

that you just accumulate. - Yes, I think you rub up

against another person,

that person well better be your spouse

if it's too much for too long.

- Yeah, but even there. - Even there.

- COVID has really test the relationship.

It's fascinating to watch.

- It has, and I do think that having some separation,

which is kind of counterintuitive

because I think a lot of people think

the more collaboration you can have, the better.

The more ideas that can bounce back and forth, the better.

And both Jason and I, for whatever reason,

came to the conclusion early on in careers.

Absolutely not, that's complete baloney.

This is why we were huge proponents of remote work.

This is why I enjoy working in my home office

where I can close the door and not see another human

for like six hours at the time.

I don't wanna bounce ideas off you all the time.

I wanna bounce ideas off you occasionally

and then I wanna go off and implement those ideas.

There's way too much bouncing going on

and not enough scoring, not enough dunking.

And I think this is one of the great traps

of executive rule.

Once a founder elevates themselves

all the way up to an executive

where what they're doing

is just telling other people what to do,

that's the realm they live in 24/7.

They just live in the idea realm.

Oh, I can just tell more people

more things what to do and we can just see it happen.

If you actually have to be part of implementing that,

you slow your horse.

You think like, do you know what?

I had a good idea last week.

I'm gonna save the rest of my good ideas

until next month.

- And there is a temptation for the managers

and for the people in the executive layer

to do something,

which that's something usually means a meeting, right?

And so that's why you say...

- Their job is telling other people what to do.

- Yeah, and the meeting,

so this is one of the big things you're against

is meeting... - Meetings are toxic.

And this really I think ties

into this with Jason and I.

If I had to count out the total number of meetings

we've had in 24 years of collaborations

where we in person sat in front of each other

and discussed a topic,

I probably it'd be less than whatever,

three months at a fan company.

We just haven't done that that much.

We haven't worn it out.

One of this funny metaphors

that Trump came up with at one point

was a human has like a limited number of steps

in their life, right?

Like that's the longevity argument here.

You could do so much activity and then you run out.

There's some kernel in that idea

that can be applied to relationship.

There's some amount of exchange we can have.

There's some amount of time we can spend together

where you can wear it out.

Jason and I were diligent about not wearing each other out.

And I think that is absolutely key

to the longevity of the relationship

combined with that level of trust.

And then just combining with the level

that we really like the work itself.

We don't just like the brainstorming.

The say where we just come up with good ideas.

No, we like to do the ideas

and we like to be part of that process directly ourselves.

I like to program, he likes to do design.

We could go off and do our little things

for long stretches of time.

In case you, come together

and go like, hey, let's launch a great product.

- This might sound like I'm asking you to do therapy,

but I find myself to sometimes

want or long for a meeting because I'm lonely.

Like 'cause it remote work is just sitting by yourself.

I don't know, it can get really lonely

for long stretches of time.

- Let me give you a tip, get a wife.

- Yes, oh, goddammit.

- Get a couple kids.

- [Lex] All right.

- Like family really is the great antidote to loneliness.

And I mean that as sincerely as I can possibly say it.

I certainly had exactly that feeling you described

early in my career

when I was working remotely and I was just a, like

me living in an apartment.

A total stereotype where for the longest time

when I first moved to Chicago,

all I had on the floor was a mattress

and then I bought this big TV and I didn't even mount it.

And then I had a stack of DVDs.

And I was basically,

I was working a lot of time

and then I would just go home and do that.

And it wasn't great.

It really wasn't.

Like I do think that humans need humans.

And if you can't get them at work

and I actually sort of kind of don't want them at work,

at least I don't want 'em for 40 hours a week.

That's not what I prefer.

You need something else.

You need other relationships in your life,

and there's no greater depth of relationship

if you can find someone

that you actually just wanna spend a lot of time with.

That's key to it.

And I think it's key for both Jason and I

that we've had families for quite a long time

and it grounds you two in a way

where the sprint of a startup

can get traded in for the marathon

of an enduring company.

And you get settled in a way.

We talked briefly about sometimes I get fired up.

I mean a lot of times,

maybe even most of the times I get fired up about topics,

but I don't get fired up in the same way now

as I used to when I was 24.

I'm still extremely passionate about ideas

and trying to find the right things,

but having a family meeting, my wife,

building a life around that

has just mellowed everything out

in a completely cliche way.

But I think it's actually key.

I think if we could get more even younger people

not to wait until they were in the late goddamn 30s

or early 40s to hitch up with someone,

we'd be better off

and we'd have more stable business relationships as well

because folks would get that nurturing human

relations somewhere else.

Now when I say all of that,

I also accept that there are plenty of great businesses

that's been built over the years

that have not been built remote,

that have been built by a gang of hooligans

sitting in an office for immense hours of time.

I mean, both John Carmack

and Tim Sweeney talked about that in the '90s

with their careers that that was just basically work, sleep,

hang out with the guys at the office, right?

A totally fair.

That never appealed to me.

Both Jason and I saw eye to eye on the idea

that 40 hours a week dedicated to work was enough

that if we were gonna go to distance

for not just the five to seven years

it takes to build a VC case up to an exit.

But for potentially 10 years, 20 years or further,

we needed to become whole humans.

Because the only that whole humanness

was gonna go to distance,

which included building up

friendships outside of work, having hobbies,

finding a mate and having a family.

And that entire higher existence,

those legs of the stool

that work is not the only thing in life

is completely related to the fact

that we've been around for 25 years.

There's way too much,

especially in America of false trade-offs.

Oh, you wanna build a successful business?

Well, you can either have money enjoyment

or family or health pick one.

What? Why do we have to give up all of this?

Now again, I'm not saying,

and there are moments of payers in life

where you can sprint.

But I am saying if that sprint turns into a decade,

you're gonna pay for it.

And you can pay for it in ways.

I've seen time and again

seem like a very bad trade that even if it works.

And by the way, most of the time it does not.

Most of the time startups go bust.

Most of the time people spend five, seven years

or something that does not pan out

and they don't get the payout

and then they just sit with regret of like,

There's way too much,

or something that does not pan out

and they don't get the payout

and then they just sit with regret of like,

what the fuck happened to my 20s?

Early on, Jason and I basically made the pact

that working together

was not gonna lead to that kind of regret.

That we were gonna allow ourselves and each other

to build a whole life outside of work.

And the fact that that worked

is something I feel is almost like forbidden knowledge,

certainly in technology circles in the US.

It's something that we've tried to champion for 20 years

and we still get slack.

For just two days ago, I had another Twitter beef

with someone saying like,

"Oh, well okay, maybe it worked,

but you didn't turn into Atlassian.

So you're a failure.

Basecamp isn't Jira, so why are you even bothering?"

And it's such a fascinating winner-takes-all mentality

that unless you dominate everyone else

in all the ways you've lost.

When so much of life is far more open to multiple winners

where we can end up with a business

that have made hundreds of millions of dollars

over the years,

and we've kept much of that to do whatever we want

and that's enough.

That's good, that's great.

That's actually something worth aspiring to.

Certainly it should be a path

for someone to consider choosing

rather than the VC unicorn of bust mentality

that dominates everything.

- Yeah, I'd love to ask you about this exchange

so you can explain to me the whole saga,

but so just to link on that a little bit

is I think there's a notion

that success for a tech founder

is like work for a few years all out

and then exit, sort of sell your company for, I don't know,

hundreds of millions of dollars.

That's success.

When it seems in reality,

when you look at who the people like you,

like really smart, creative humans,

who they actually are and what happiness entails.

It actually entails working your whole life a little bit.

It's like because you actually love the programming,

you love the building, you love the designer

and you don't want to exit.

And that's something you've talked about

really eloquently about.

So like you actually want to create a life

where you're always doing the building

and doing it in a way

that's not completely taken over your life.

- Mojito Island is a mirage.

It always was.

There is no retirement for ambitious people.

There is no just sitting back on the beach

and sipping a mojito for what?

For two weeks before you go damn crazy

and wanna get back into the action?

That's exactly what happens to most people

who have the capacity to build those kinds of exits.

I've never seen, I shouldn't say never.

I've almost never seen anyone be able to pull that off.

Yet so many think that that's why they're doing it.

That's why they're sacrificing everything.

Because once I get to the finish line, I'm golden.

I've won, I can retire, I can sit back, I can just relax.

And you find out

that that kind of relaxation is actually hell.

It's hell for creative people to squander

their God-given creative juices and capacities.

And I was really lucky to read the book "Flow"

by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

early on - Nice,

the pronunciations, spot on. - You know what?

I had to practice that

with AI over the last few days

because I knew I was gonna cite him

and I butchered his name several times.

So AI taught me how to pronounce that,

at least somewhat correctly.

But his main work over his career

was essentially the concept of flow

that came out of a search for understanding happiness.

Why are some people happy?

When are they happy?

And what he learned was quite illuminating.

He learned that people aren't happy

when they sit on Mojito Island.

They're not happy when they're free

of all obligations and responsibilities.

No, they're happy in these moments

where they're reaching and stretching their capacities

just beyond what they can currently do.

In those moments of flow,

they can forget time and space.

They can sit in front

of the key board program a hard problem,

think 20 minutes have passed

and suddenly it's been three hours.

They look back upon those moments

with the greatest amount of joy.

And that is what peak happiness is.

If you take away the pursuit of those kinds of problems,

if you eliminate all the problems from your plate,

you're gonna get depressed.

You're are not gonna have a good time.

Now there are people who can do that,

but they're not the same kind of people

who built these kinds of companies.

So you have to accept the kind of individual you are.

If you are on this path, don't bullshit yourself.

Don't bullshit yourself into thinking,

I'm just gonna sacrifice everything,

my health, my family, my hobbies, my friends,

but in 10 years I'm gonna make it all up

because in 10 years I can do it.

It never works out like that.

It doesn't work out on both ends of it.

It does not work out

if you're successful and you sell your company,

because you'll get bored out of your mind

after two weeks on retirement.

It doesn't work out if the company is a failure

and you regret the last 10 years spent for nothing.

It doesn't work out if it all works

and you stay in the business

because it never gets any easier.

So you're gonna fail on all metrics if you just go,

there's only work and nothing else.

And I didn't want that.

I wanted the happiness of flow.

I understood that insight was true,

but I wanted to do it in a way

where I could sustain the journey for 40 or 50 years.

- And there's another other interesting caveat

that I've heard you say

is that if you do exit and you sell your company

and you wanna stay in, you wanna do another company

that's going to usually not be as fulfilling.

Because really your first baby, like.

- You can't do it again or most people can't do it again.

A, because their second idea

is not gonna be as good as the first one.

It is so rare to capture lightning in the bottle

like we have, for example, with Basecamp.

I know this from experience

because I've been trying to build

a lot of other businesses since.

And some of them have been moderate successes,

even good successes, none of them have been Basecamp.

It's really difficult to do that twice.

But founders are arrogant pricks, including myself.

And we like to think that, do you know what?

We succeeded in large part because we're just awesome.

We're just so much better than everyone else.

And in some ways that's true some of the time.

But you can also be really good at something

that matters for a hot moment that door is open.

The door closes now you're still good at the thing,

but it doesn't matter.

No one cares.

There's that part of it.

And then there's the part of it that going back

to experience things for the first time

only happens the first time.

You can't do it again.

I don't know if I have it in me

to go through the of the early days again.

And I say bullshit in the sense of the most endearing sense.

It's all great to do it.

I know too much.

This is one of the reasons why,

whenever I'm asked the questions,

if you could tell your younger self

something that would really,

what would you say to your younger self?

I would fuck not say a thing.

I would not rob my younger self

of all the life experiences that I've been blessed

with due to the ignorance of how the world works.

Building up the wisdom about how the world works is a joy.

And you gotta build it one break at a time

if you just handed all the results.

It's like, oh, should we watch your movie?

Here's how it ends.

I don't wanna fucking watch the movie now.

You spoiled it.

I don't want you to spoil my business experience.

I don't wanna spoil any of my ignorance.

The greatest blessing half the time

when you're starting something new is A,

you don't know how hard it's gonna be;

B, you don't know what you don't know.

Like the adventure is to pay off,

the responsibility is to pay off.

This is something Jordan Peterson

has really taught me to articulate.

This notion that responsibility is actually key to me.

"Man's Search for Meaning,"

Viktor Frankl talks about this as well,

that we can endure any hardship if there's a reason why.

Now he talked about it in truly life altering

concentration can't waste.

But you can also apply at a smaller scale

with less criticality

of even just your daily life

that all that hardship in building the original business

that is responsibility

you take upon yourself the appeal.

The reason you take that on you

is in part because you don't know fully what it entails.

If you had known upfront, if I had known upfront,

how hard it would be?

How much frustration there'd be along the way?

If you just told me that in a narrative

before I got started, I would've been like, eh,

maybe I should just go get a job.

- You said so many smart things there.

Just to pick one.

It's funny that sometimes the advice givers,

the wisdom givers have gone through all the bullshit.

And so there is a degree

to which you wanna make the mistake.

So I think I would still give the advice of you

want to have a stretch of your life

where you work too hard, including a thing that fails.

I don't think you can learn the lessons

why that's a bad idea in any other way except by doing it.

There is a degree like, but of course you don't.

- I think you should stretch.

Should you have to stretch for a decade?

I'm not so sure.

- Yeah, the decade thing is 20s is a special time.

- It's a lot to trade.

You don't get your 20s back.

Yeah, you don't get your 30s back.

You don't get your 40s back.

You really, I would've regretted personally

if I hadn't done the other things I did in my 20s,

if I hadn't had the fun I had,

if I hadn't had the friends I had,

if I hadn't built up the hobbies that I did,

if I hadn't started driving race cars

at an early enough age to actually get really good at it,

if I had just gone all in on business

because I would've got the same out in the end.

This is something Derek Sivers really taught me

is he has this great essay

about how when he went for a bike ride,

he could go really hard all out

and he could do the ride I think in whatever 19 minutes.

Or he could enjoy the ride, go 5% slower,

do the ride in 21 minutes

and realize there's only two minutes apart.

Either I go all in all the time, there's nothing else,

I'm completely exhausted at the alt.

Or I travel the same distance

and I arrive maybe two minutes later,

but I got to enjoy the scenery,

listen to the birds, smell the flowers.

That journey is also valuable.

Now I say that while accepting and celebrating

that if you wanna be the best at one thing in the world,

no, you have to sacrifice everything.

You have to be obsessed with just that thing.

There is no instant

of someone who's the best in the world at something

who's not completely obsessed at.

I didn't need to be the best at anything.

This was a rare blessing of humility

I had early on is like, do you know what?

I am not that smart.

I'm not that good.

I'm not that talented.

I can do interesting things

by combining different aspects and elements that I know,

but I'm not gonna be the best at anything.

And that released me from this singular obsession

with just going,

I'm gonna be the best programmer in the world.

Eh, I know I'm not.

I failed at it twice

before I even got how conditional it's worked.

I'm not smart enough to be the best at anything.

I'm not dedicated enough to do that.

That's a bit of a blessing.

And I think as a society, we have to straddle

both celebrating peak excellence,

which we do all the time

and celebrating the peak intensity

of mission it takes to become that.

And then also going like, do you know what?

We don't all need to be Michael Jordan.

There's only gonna be one of those.

- Well, we should say that there's certain pursuits

where a singular obsession is required.

Basketball is one of them.

By the way, probably racing.

If you wanna be the best at F1 in the world...

- If you wanna be Senna, you gotta be a maniac.

- But I would argue

that there's most disciplines like programming

allows if you want to be, quote, unquote, "the best,"

whatever that means,

I think that's judged at the end of your life.

And usually if you look at that path,

it's gonna be an nonlinear one.

It you're not gonna look like the life

of an Olympic athlete who's singular focus.

There's gonna be some acid there in the 20s

or there's going to be a several detours,

which the true greats.

There's gonna be detours.

And sometimes they're not gonna be

Steve Jobs asset type of situation.

There'll be just different companies

you've worked for different careers

or different sort of efforts

you allocated your life to.

But it's gonna be non-linear.

It's not gonna be a singular focus.

- The way I think about this sometimes

is I want a good bargain on learning.

I can become in the top 5%

of whatever I defined as good at something

much, much easier.

Perhaps it's 20 times easier, 100 times easier

to get into the top 5% than it is to get into the top 0.1%.

That's almost impossibly hard to get into that.

But if I'm content just being in the top 5%,

I can be in the top 5% on like five things at once.

I can get really good at writing.

I can get decent at driving a race car.

I can become pretty good at programming.

I can run a company.

I can have a family.

I can do a lot of things at the same time.

That gives me sort of that variety

that almost was idealized Karl Marx has this idea,

"Oh, I'm gonna fish in the morning

and hammer in the evening

and paint on the weekends, right?"

That there's a sense for me at least

where his diagnosis of alienation was true.

That just that tunnel vision.

There's just this one thing I'm just gonna focus on that

gives me a sense of alienation I can't stomach.

When I'm really deep on programming

and sometimes I go deep for weeks,

maybe even in a few cases months,

I have to come up for air

and I have to go do something else.

Like, all right, that was programming for this year.

I've done my part and I'm gonna go off riding

or annoy people on the internet

or drive some race cars to do something else.

And then I can do the programming thing

with full intensity again next year.

- Speaking of annoying people on the internet,

you gotta explain to me this drama.

Okay, so what is this guy that said,

imagine losing to Jira but boasting

that you have a couple million dollars per year.

So this had to do with this almost now a meme decision

to leave the cloud.

DHH left the cloud.

I think that's literally a meme,

but it's also a fascinating decision.

Can you talk through the full saga of DHH

leaves the cloud?

- Yes. - Of leaving AWS saving money.

And I guess the case this person is making now.

Can you talk through the full saga of DHH

leaves the cloud?

- Yes. - Of leaving AWS saving money.

And I guess the case this person is making now.

- Is that we wasted our time optimizing a business

that could've been a hundred times bigger

if we'd just gone for the moon.

- And for the moon includes?

- Venture capital. - But also...

- And other things in not caring about cost.

- But also because AGIs are on the corner,

you should have been investing into AI, right?

Is this just part of? - Sort of tank ginger?

I think it's a bit of a muddy argument,

but if we just take it at it's peak ideal,

which I actually think is a reasonable point,

is that you can get myopically focused on counting pennies

when you should be focused on getting, right?

That I've optimized our spend on infrastructure

by getting out of the cloud

and that took some time and I could have taken that time

and spend it on making more features

that would've attract more customers

or spend even more time with AI or done other things.

Opportunity cost is real.

I'm not denying that.

I'm pushing back on the idea that for a company of our size

saving $2 million a year on our infrastructure bill,

which is about somewhere between half to two thirds

goes directly to the bottom line,

which means it's return to Jason or I as owners

and our employees part of our profit sharing plan,

is totally worth doing.

This idea that costs don't matter

is a very Silicon Valley way of thinking

that again, understand at the scale of something maybe,

but I also actually think it's aesthetically unpleasing.

I find an inefficient business

as I find an inefficient program full of line noise

to just be a splinter in my brain.

I hate looking at an expense report

and just seeing disproportionate waste.

And when I was looking at our spend

at 37signals a while back, a few years back,

I saw bills that did not pass my smell test.

I remembered how much we used to spend

on infrastructure before the cloud

and I saw numbers I could not recognize

in proportion to what we needed.

The fact that computers had gotten so much faster over time,

shouldn't things be getting cheaper?

Why are we spending more and more money

servicing more customers?

Yes, but with much faster computers,

Moore's Law should be lowering the costs

and the opposite is happening.

Why is that happening?

And that started a journey of unwinding

why the cloud isn't as great as the deal

as people like to think that.

- Yeah, can we look at the specifics

just for people who don't know the story

and then generalize to what it means about

the role of the cloud and the tech business.

So the specifics is you were using AWS S3 for...

- We were using AWS for everything.

HEY.com launched as an entirely cloud app.

It was completely on AWS for compute,

for databases, for all of it.

We were using all the systems

as they're best prescribed that we should.

Our total cloud bill for Basecamp,

our total spend with AWS was I think 3.2 million

or 3.4 million at its peak.

That's kind of a lot of money.

3.4 million, I mean we have a ton of users and customers,

but still that just struck me as unreasonable.

And the reason why it was so unreasonable

was because I had the pitch for the cloud

ringing in my ears.

Hey, this is gonna be faster.

This is gonna be easier.

This is gonna be cheaper.

Why are you trying to produce your own power, right?

Like, do you have your own power plant?

Why would you do that?

Leave the computers to the hyperscalers.

They're much better at it anyway.

I actually thought that was a compelling pitch.

I bought in on that pitch for several years

and thought, do you know what?

I'm done ever owning a server again.

We are just gonna render our capacity

and Amazon is gonna be able to offer us services

much cheaper than we could buy 'em themselves

because they're gonna have these economies of scale.

And I was thinking Jeff's word ringing.

My competitors margin is my opportunity.

That was something he used to drive amazon.com with.

That if he could just make 2%

when the other guy was trying to make 4%,

he would end up with all the money.

And on volume, he would still win.

So I thought that was the operating ethos for AWS.

It turns out that's not true at all.

AWS by the way operates its almost 40% margin.

So just in that, there's a clue

that competitors are not able to do the competitive thing

we like about capitalism,

which is to lower costs and so forth.

So the cloud pitch in my optics,

it's fundamentally false.

It did not get easier first of all.

I dunno if you've used AWS recently,

it is hella complicated.

If you think Linux is hard,

you've never tried to set up IAM rules

or access parameters or whatever for AWS.

- AWS is always difficult.

It was always complicated.

- Well, I think it's gotten even more difficult.

But yes, now some of that is it's difficult

because it's very capable

and you have a bunch of capacity on tap.

And there are reasons I don't think they're good enough

to justify how complicated

the whole jing-a-ma-jing has become.

But what's certainly true is that it's no longer easier.

It's not easier to use AWS

than it is to run your own machines,

which we learned when we pulled out the cloud

and didn't hire a single extra person.

Even though we operate all our own hardware,

the team stayed exactly the same.

So you have this three-way pitch, right?

It's gonna be easier,

it's gonna be cheaper.

Certainly wasn't cheaper.

We've just proved that

by cutting our spend on infrastructure

by half to two thirds.

And it's gonna be faster.

The last bit was true,

but way too many people overestimated

the value of that speed.

If you need a thousand computers online

in the next 15 minutes, nothing beats the cloud.

How would you even procure that?

If we just need another 20 servers,

it's gonna take a week or two

to get boxes shipped on pallets

delivered to a data center and unwrapped and racked,

and all that stuff, right?

But how often do we need to do that?

And how often do we need to do that

if buying those servers is way, way cheaper

so we get vastly more compute

for the same amount of money.

Could we just buy more servers

and not even care about the fact

that we're not hyper optimized on the compute utility?

That we don't have to use things like automatic scaling

to figure things out because we have to reduce costs?

Yes, we can.

So we went through this journey over a realization

in early 2023

when I had finally had enough with our bills.

I wanted to get rid of them. I wanted to spend less money.

I wanted to keep more of the money ourselves.

And in just over six months,

we moved seven major applications out of the cloud

in terms of compute caching databases

to works onto our own servers.

A glorious, beautiful new fleet bought

from the king of servers, Michael Dell,

who really, by the way, is another icon

on my, I saw he just celebrated 41 years in business.

41 years this man has been selling awesome servers

that we've been using for our entire existence.

But anyway, these pallets arrive in a couple of weeks

and we rack 'em up and get everything going.

And we were out.

At least with the compute part.

We then had a long multi-year commitment to S3

because the only way to get decent pricing

in the cloud, by the way,

is not to buy on a day-to-day basis,

not to rent on a database basis,

but to bind yourself up to multi-year contracts

with computes often a year.

That was in our case and with storage is was four years.

We signed a four-year contract

to store our petabytes of customer files in the cloud,

to be able to get something just halfway decent affordable.

So all of these projects came together to the sense

that we're now saving literally millions of dollars,

projected about 10 million over five years.

It's always hard.

How do you do the accounting exactly,

and TOC this, that and the other thing.

But it's millions of dollars.

But it's not just that.

It's also the fact that getting out of the cloud

meant returning to more of an original idea of the internet.

That the internet was not the sign

such that three computers should run everything.

It was a distributed network

such that the individual nodes

could disappear and the whole thing would still carry on.

DARPA had designed this such that the Russians

could take out Washington

and they could still fight back from New York,

that the entire communication infrastructure

wouldn't disappear because there was no hub and spoke.

It was a network.

I always found that an immensely beautiful vision.

That you could have this glorious internet

and no single node was in control of everything.

And we've returned to much more of a single

node controlling everything

idea with these hyperscalers.

When US-East-1, the main and original region

for AWS goes offline,

which has happened more than a few times over the years.

Seemingly a third of the internet is offline.

Like that in itself is just an insult to DARPA's design.

It just detract from the fact

that what AWS built was marvelous.

I think the cloud has moved so many things so far forward,

especially around virtualization, automation setup.

It's all those giant forward for system administration

that's allowing us now

to be able to run things on-prem in a way

that smells and feels much like the cloud

just at half the cost or less,

and with the autonomy

and the satisfaction of owning hardware.

I don't know what the last time you looked at

like an actual server and took it apart

and looked inside of it.

These things are gorgeous.

I mean, I posted a couple of pictures

of our racks out in the data center

and people always go crazy for 'em

because we've gotten so abstracted

from what the underlying metal looks like

in this cloud age that most people have no idea.

They've no idea how powerful a modern CPU is.

They have no idea

how much RAM you can fit into a one U rack.

Progress in computing has been really exciting,

especially I'd say in the last four to five years

after TSMC with Apple's help really pushed the envelope.

I mean, we kind of sat still there for a while

while Intel was spinning their wheels going nowhere.

And then TSMC with Apple propelling them

really moved things forward.

And now servers are exciting again.

Like you're getting jumps year over year and the 15, 20%

rather than the single digit we were stuck with for a while.

And that all means that owning your own hardware

is a more feasible proposition than it's ever been.

That you need fewer machines to run ever more

and that more people should do it.

Because as much as I love Jeff and Amazon,

like he doesn't need another whatever,

40% margin on all the tech stuff

that I buy to run our business.

And this is just something I've been focused on.

Both because of the ideology

around honoring DARPA's original design,

the practicality of running our own hardware,

seeing how fast we can push things

with the latest machines and then saving the money.

And that has all been so enjoyable to do,

but also so counterintuitive for a lot of people

because it seemed,

I think for a lot of people in the industry

that like we'd all decided

that we were done buying computers,

that that was something we would just delegate to AWS

and Azure and Google Cloud,

that we didn't have to own these things anymore.

So I think there's a little bit of whiplash

for some people that, "Oh, I thought we agreed.

We were done with that."

And then along come us

and say, "Ah, do you know what?

Maybe you should have a computer."

- Is there some pain points to running your own servers?

- Oh, plenty.

There's pain points to operating computers of all kind.

Have you tried just like

using a personal computer these days?

Half the time when my kids or my wife

have a problem, I go like,

have you tried turning it just off and on again.

Computers are inherently painful to humans.

Owning your own computer though

kind of makes some of that pain worth it.

There's a responsibility

that comes with actually owning the hardware that to me,

at least make the burden of operating

that hardware seem slightly more enjoyable.

Now there are things you have to learn,

certainly at our scale too.

I mean, we're not just buying a single computer

and plugging into an ethernet.

We have to have racks and racks with them

and you gotta set it up with network cabling

and there is some specialized expertise in that,

but it's not like that expertise

is like building nuclear rockets.

It's not like it's not widely distributed.

Literally the entire internet

was built on people knowing

how to plug in a computer to the internet, right?

Oh, ethernet cable goes here, power cable goes here,

let's boot up Linux.

That's how everyone put anything online

until 10, 12 years ago

when the cloud sort of took over.

So the expertise is there and can be rediscovered.

You too can learn how to operate a Linux computer.

- Yeah, and it's, you know, when you get a bunch of them,

there's a bunch of flashing LEDs

and it's just so exciting. - Oh, they're beautiful,

calming, amazing.

Computers are really fun.

This is actually something I've gotten into even deeper

after we moved out of the cloud.

Now my next kind of tingle

is that if you could move out of the cloud,

can you also move out of the data center?

Personal servers have gotten really scarily

quick and efficient

and personal internet connections

rival what we connected data centers with

just a decade or two ago.

So there's a whole community

around this concept of home lapping,

which is essentially installing server hardware

in your own apartment, connecting it to the internet,

and exposing that directly to the internet.

That harks back to those glorious days of the '90s

when people building for the internet

would host the actual website

on their actual computer in the closet.

And I'm pretty fired up about that.

I'm doing a bunch of experiments.

I've ordered a bunch of home servers

from my own apartment.

I marvel at the fact

that I can get a five gigabit, five connection now,

I think, do you know what five gigabit

that could have taken Basecamp

to multiple millions of MRR

in the way that back then,

I ran the whole business on a single box

with 2004 technology or probably a hundred megabit cable.

Like the capacity we have access to

both in terms of compute and connectivity

is something that people haven't readjusted to.

And this happens sometimes in technology

where progress sneaks up on you.

This happened with SSDs.

I love that, by the way.

We designed so much of our technology

and storage approach and database design

around spinning metal disks

that had certain seek rate properties.

where progress sneaks up on you.

This happened with SSDs.

I love that, by the way.

We designed so much of our technology

and storage approach and database design

around spinning metal disks

that had certain seek rate properties.

And then we went to NVMe and SSDs,

and it took quite a while for people to realize

that the systems had to be built

fundamentally different now.

That the difference between memory and disk

was now far smaller

when you weren't spinning these metal plates around

with a little head that had to read off them.

You were essentially just dealing

with another type of memory.

I think we're a little bit in that same phase

when it comes to the capacity of new businesses

to be launched literally out of your damn bedroom.

- So you can get pretty far with a large user based

with home labing?

- Absolutely. - That's exciting.

That's like the old school.

That's really exciting, right?

- It's bringing back the startup in the garage

in the literal physical sense of the word.

Now some of that is do we need to,

you can get relatively cheap cloud capacity

if you don't need very much.

- Hell yes, we need to.

I mean the feeling of doing that by yourself

of seeing LED lights in your own home.

I mean there's nothing like that.

- There's just an aesthetic to it

that I am completely in love with

and I wanna try to push on.

Now it's not gonna be the same

thing as getting out of the cloud.

I'm not sure our exit out of the cloud

was not the exit out of the data center.

We basically just bought hardware,

shipped it to a professionally managed data center

that we didn't even actually touch.

This is the other misconception people have about

moving out of the cloud.

That we have a bunch of people

who are constantly driving to a data center somewhere

to rack new boxes and change dead RAM.

That's not how things happen in the modern world at all.

We have a company called Summit, previously Deft,

that is what we call white gloves.

They work in the data center

when we need something like,

"Hey Deft, can you go down and swap the dead SSD

in box number six?"

They do it.

And what we see is akin to what someone working

with the cloud would see.

You see IP addresses coming online.

You see drives coming online.

It's not that different,

but it is a whole heck of a lot cheaper

when you are operating at our scale.

And of course it is.

Of course it's cheaper to own things

if you need those things for years

rather than it is to rent it.

In no other domain would we confuse those two things

that it's cheaper to own for the long duration

than it is to rent.

- There is some gray area, like I've gotten a chance

to interact with the xAI team a bunch.

I'm probably going back out there in Memphis

to do a big podcast associated with the Grok release.

And those folks, in order to achieve the speed

of building up the cluster

and to solve some of the novel aspects

that have to do with the GPU, with the training,

they have to be a little bit more hands on.

It's a less white glove.

- Oh, and I love that, right?

They're dealing with a frontier problem

and they're dealing with it not by renting a bunch of GPUs

at a huge markup from their main competitor.

They're going like, "No, screw that.

We're gonna put a hundred thousand GPUs

in our own tents," right?

And build it in absolute record time.

So I think if anything, this is testament to the idea

that owning hardware can give you an advantage

both at the small scale, at the medium scale

and at the pioneer levels of computing.

- By the way, you know, speaking of teams,

that those are xAI,

Tesla are large companies, but all those folks,

I don't know what it is about,

you said Jeff is really good at finding good people,

at seeing strength in people.

Like Elon is also extremely,

I don't know what that is.

Actually, I've never actually seen,

maybe you could speak to that.

He's good at finding greatness.

- I don't think he's finding as much as he's attracting.

He's attracting the talent

because of the audacious of his goals and his mission.

The clarity by which he states it.

He doesn't have to go scour the earth

to find the best people.

The best people come to him

because he is, talking about Elon here,

one of the singular most invigorating figures.

In both the same order of the universe here,

haters and lovers, right?

Like he's having such an impact at such a scale

that of course he's gotta have literally

millions of people think

he's the worst person in the world

and he's also gonna have millions of people thinking

he's the greatest gift to humanity.

Depending on the day.

I'm somewhere in between.

But I'm more on the greatest gift to humanity

end of the scale than I'm on the other end of the scale.

And I think that really inspires people in a way

that we've almost forgotten

that that level of audacity is so rare that when we see it,

we don't fully know how to analyze it.

We think of Elon as finding great talent

and I'm sure he is also good at that.

But I also think that this beacon of the mission,

we're going to fucking Mars.

We're gonna transform transportation

into using electricity.

We're gonna cover the earth in internet

is so grand that there are days where I wake up and go like,

what the fuck am I doing with these to-do lists?

Like Jesus, should I go sign up for something like that?

Yeah, that sounds invigorating in a sense.

I can only imagine like a biking back

in 10, 50 going like, should we go to Normandy?

You may die along the way,

but oh boy, does that sound like a journey

and an adventure.

- There's a few components.

There's one definitely this bigger than life mission

and really believing it.

You know, every other sentence is about Mars,

like really believing it.

It doesn't really matter what,

like anybody else, the criticism, anything.

There's a very singular focused big mission.

But I think it also has to do a bunch

of the other components.

Like being able to hire well once the people,

once the beacon attracts.

And I've just seen people that don't necessarily on paper

have a resume with the track record.

I've seen really who now turned out

to be like legendary people.

He basically like tosses 'em the ball of leadership.

Sees something in them and says like, "You go."

And gives them the ownership and they run with it.

And that happens at every scale.

That there's a real meritocracy.

And like there's something,

there's just like, you could see the flourishing

of human intellect in these meetings,

in these group getting together where they're like,

the energy is palpable.

It's like exciting for me to just be around that.

There's not many companies I've seen that

in because when a company becomes successful and larger,

it somehow suffocates that energy.

I guess you see in startups at the early stages.

But like it's cool to see it at a large company

that's actually able to achieve scale, you know?

- I think part of the secret there

is that Elon actually knows things.

And when you know things,

you can evaluate the quality of work products.

And when you can evaluate the quality of work products,

you can very quickly tell who's full of shit

and who will actually take you to Mars.

And you can fire the people who's full of shit

and you can bet on the people who get us to Mars.

That capacity to directly evaluate

the competency of individuals,

it's actually a little bit rare.

It's not widely distributed

amongst managers, hiring managers.

It's not something you can easily delegate

to people who are not very skilled at the work itself.

And Elon obviously knows a lot about a lot

and he can smell who knows stuff for real.

And is this at our tiny scale,

something I've tried to do in the same order

where when we hire programmers, for example,

it's gonna be interesting now with AI

as the new challenge.

But up until this point,

the main pivot point for getting hired

was not your resume,

was not the schooling you've had,

it was not your grades, was not your pedigree,

it was how well you did on two things.

A, your cover letter.

Because I can only work with people remotely

if they're good writers.

So if you can't pen a proper capital letter

and can't bother to put in the effort

to write it specifically for us, you're out.

Two, you have to be able to program really well

to the degree that I can look at your code

and go like, yeah, I wanna work with that person.

Not only I wanna work with that person,

I wanna work on that person's code

when I have to see it again in five years

to fix some damn bug.

So we're gonna give you a programming test

that simulates the way we work for real

and we're gonna see how you do.

And I've been surprised time and again

where I thought for sure this candidate is a shoe-in,

they sound just right, the CV is just right

and then you see the code getting turned in.

I'm like, no way.

No way are we hiring this person.

And the other way has been true as well.

I've go like, I don't know about this guy or this woman.

Eh, I dunno.

And then they turn in their coach stuff

and I'm like, holy shit,

can that person be on my team tomorrow, preferably?

The capacity to evaluate work product

is a superpower when it comes to hiring.

- There's a step that I've seen Elon do really well,

which is be able to show up and say,

this can be done simpler.

- [DHH] Yes.

- But he knows what he's talking about.

And then the engineer,

because Elon knows enough,

the engineer who's first reaction,

you can kind of tell like,

it's almost like rolling your eyes

if your parent tells you something.

This is not, no, we've I've been working

on this for a month, you don't...

But then when you have that conversation a little more,

you realize no, it can be done simpler.

Find the way.

So there's a good, when two engineers are talking,

one might not have perfect information.

But if the senior engineer has like good instinct

that's like been battle earned,

then you can say simplify.

And it actually will result in simplification.

- And I think this is the hallmark of the true greats.

That they not only have the insight

into what's required to do the work,

but they also have the transcendent vision

to go beyond what the engineer would do,

the programmer would do.

I think if we are looking at these rarities,

obviously the myth of Steve Jobs was also this.

Even though perhaps he was less technical

than Elon is in many ways,

he had the same capacity to show up to a product team

and really challenge them

to look harder for the simplification

or for making things greater

in a way that would garner disbelief

from the people who are supposed to do it.

Like this guy is full of shit.

Like this is crazy.

We can never, and then two months later it is.

So there is something of this

where you need the vision,

you need it anchored by the reality

of knowing enough about what's possible,

knowing enough about physics,

knowing enough about software,

that you're not just building bullshit.

There are plenty of people who can tell

a group of engineers.

No, just do it faster.

Like that's not a skill.

It's gotta be anchored in something real,

but it's also gonna be anchored in, it's a tired word,

but a passion for the outcome to a degree

where you get personally insulted if a bad job is done.

This is what I've been writing about lately with Apple.

They've lost that asshole

who would show up and tell engineers

that what they did was not good enough

in ways that would actually perhaps

make them feel a little small in the moment,

but would spark that zest to really fix it.

Now they have a logistics person

who's very good at sourcing components

and lining up production Gantt charts,

but you're not getting that magic.

Now what's interesting with that whole scenario

was I actually thought how well Tim Cook ran things

and has run things at Apple for so long

that maybe we were wrong.

Maybe we were wrong about the criticality of Steve Jobs

to the whole mission.

Maybe you could get away with not having it.

I think the bill was going to come later and now it has.

Apple is failing in all these ways

that someone who would blow up Steve's ghost

and really insult him would say like, see?

This is what's happening now.

So the other thing here too, of course,

is it's impossible to divorce.

Like your perception of what's a critical component

of the system and the messy reality

of a million different moving parts

in the reality of life.

And you should be skeptical about your own analysis

and your own thesis at all time.

- Since you mentioned Apple, I have to ask

somebody in the internet submitted the question.

Does DHH still hate Apple?

I believe the question is.

So there was a time

when Basecamp went to war with Apple over the 30%.

Can you tell the saga of that battle?

- Yes, but first I'll tell you,

I fell in love with Apple,

which was all the way back in also early 2000s

when Microsoft was dominating the industry

in a way we now see Apple

and Google dominate mobile phones.

Microsoft was just everything

when it came to personal computers,

and I really did not like the Microsoft of the '90s.

The Microsoft of the '90s was the cutoff the air supply

to Netscape kind of characters

was the Bill Gates sitting defiant

in an interview with the DOJ

asking about what the definition of what is.

And just overall unpleasant, I think.

You can have respect for what was achieved,

but I certainly didn't like it.

And as we've talked about,

I came begrudgingly to the PC after Commodore fell apart

and I couldn't continue to use the Amiga.

So I already had a bit of a bone to pick with PCs

just over the fact that I love my Amiga so much.

But then in the early 2000s,

Apple emerged as a credible alternative

because they bet the new generation of Macs

on Unix underpinnings.

And that allowed me to escape from Microsoft,

and suddenly I became one of the biggest boosters of Apple.

I was in my graduating class

at the Copenhagen Business School.

I started with the first white iBook,

first person using Mac.

And by the time we were done in graduating,

I had basically converted half the class

to using Apple computers,

'cause I would evangelize them so hard

and demonstrate them

and do all the things that a super fan would do.

And I continued that work over many years.

Jason or I actually in I think 2004, 2005,

did an ad for Apple

that they posted on the developer side

where we were all about like Apple is so integral

# Chapter 16

Jason or I actually in I think 2004, 2005,

did an ad for Apple

that they posted on the developer side

where we were all about like Apple is so integral

to everything that we do and we look up to them

and we are inspired by them.

And that love relationship actually

continued for a very long time.

I basically just became a Mac person for 20 years.

I didn't even care about looking at PCs.

It seemed irrelevant to me, whatever Microsoft was doing,

which felt like such a relief.

Because in the '90s,

I felt like I couldn't escape Microsoft

and suddenly I had found my escape.

And now I was with Apple and it was glorious

and they shared so many of my sensibilities

and my aesthetics and they kept pushing the envelope,

and there was so much to be proud of,

so much to look up to.

And then that sort of started to change with the iPhone,

which is weird because the iPhone is what made modern Apple.

It's what I lined up in 2007 together

with Jason for five hours to stand in the line

to buy a first generation product

where Apple staff would clap at you

when you walked out the store.

I don't know if you remember that. It was a whole ceremony

and it was part of that myth and mystique and awe of Apple.

So I wasn't in the market for other computers.

I wasn't in the market for other computer ideas.

I thought perhaps I'd be with the Mac

until the end of days.

But as Apple discovered the gold mine,

it is to operate a toll booth

where you don't have to innovate,

where you don't actually even have to make anything,

where you can just take 30%

of other people's business.

There was a rot that crept into the foundation

of Apple and that started all the way back

from the initial launch of the app store.

But I don't think we saw at the time,

I didn't see at the time

just how critical the mobile phone

would become to computing in general.

I thought when the iPhone came out that like,

oh, it's like a mobile phone.

I've had a mobile phone since the early '90s.

Well, it wasn't a mobile phone.

It was a mobile computer.

And even more than that,

it was the most important computer

or it would become the most important computer

for most people around the world.

Which meant that if you liked to make software

and wanted to sell it to people,

you had to go through that computer.

And if going through that computer meant

going through Apple's toll booth

and not just having to ask them permission,

which in and of itself was just an dignity.

When you're used to the internet

where you don't have to ask anyone permission

about anything, you buy a domain

and you launch a business

and if customers show up, boom, you're success.

And if they don't, well you're a failure.

Now suddenly before you could even launch,

you'd have to ask Apple for permission.

That always sat wrong with me.

But it wasn't until we launched HEY in 2001

that I saw the full extent of the rot

that has snug into Apple's apple.

- For people who don't know

and we'll talk about it,

HEY is this amazing email

sort of attempt to solve the email problem.

- Yes, I like to pitch it as what Gmail

would've been with 20 years of lessons applied

in a way where they could actually ship.

Gmail was incredible when it launched in 2004.

And it still is a great product

but it's also trapped in its initial success.

You can't redesign Gmail today,

it just has way too many users.

So if you want fresh thinking on email,

I wanted fresh thinking on email.

I needed to build my own email system.

And not just my own email client.

That's what a lot of people have done over the years.

They build a client for Gmail,

but you're severely constrained

if you don't control the email server as well.

If you really wanna move the ball forward with email,

you have to control both the server and the client.

And that was the audacious mission

we set out to do with HEY.

And that was what's funny,

I thought our main obstacle here would be Gmail.

It's the 800 pound gorilla in the email space.

Something like 70% of all email in the US

is sent through Gmail.

I think their world rates

are probably in that neighborhood as well.

They're just absolutely huge

and trying to attack an enormous established competitor

like that who's so actually still loved

by plenty of people.

And is free seems like a suicide mission.

And it was only a mission we signed up for

because we had grown ambitious enough

after making Basecamp for 20 years

that we thought we could tackle that problem.

So I thought, hey, this is dumb.

I would not advise anyone to go head to head with Gmail.

That seems like a suicide mission.

We're gonna try anyway, because you know what?

If we fail it's gonna be fine.

We're just gonna build a better email experience

for me and Jason and the people at the company

and our cat, and that'll be okay

'cause we're gonna afford to do so.

But when we got ready to launch,

after spending two years building this product,

millions of dollars in investment to it.

We obviously needed mobile apps.

You're not gonna be a serious contender with email

if you're not on a mobile phone

and you need to be there with a native client.

So we had built a great native client

for both iOS and for Android.

And as we were getting ready to launch,

we submitted both of them to the app stores,

got both of them approved on I think Friday afternoon

for the iOS app.

And we then went live on Monday.

And we were so excited.

Hey world, we've been working on this new thing,

I'd love for you to check it out.

And of course as with anything,

when you launch a new product, there are some bugs.

So we quickly found a few in the iOS client

and submitted a new build to Apple.

Hey, here's our bug faces, can you please update?

And that's when on help broke loose.

Not only were they not gonna prove our update,

they said, oh wait a minute,

we gave you permission to be in the app store,

but I'm sorry that was a mistake.

We see that you're not using our in-app payment system,

which means that we don't get 30% of your business.

You will have to rectify that

or you can't be in the app store.

And first I thought like, well it got approved already.

We're running on the same model.

We've run Basecamp on in the app store for a decade.

If you're not signing up through the app

and we're signing up our own customers on our own website

and they're just going to the app store

to download their companion app, we're gonna be fine.

That was the truth, right?

That was why I never got so fired up about the app store.

Even as Apple started tightening the screws

was like my business was okay.

Now suddenly my business wasn't okay.

Apple was willing to destroy HEY if we did not agree

to give them 30% of all the signups

that came through the iOS app.

And it wasn't just about the 30%.

It was also about splitting

and not longer having a direct relationship

with our customers.

When you sell an app in the app store,

you're not selling an app to a customer.

You're selling an app to inventory at Apple,

and then Apple sells an app to that customer.

That customer has a purchasing relationship with Apple.

So if you wanna give discounts or refunds or whatever,

it's complete hell.

If you want to easily support multi-platform

that's complete hell if someone signs up

for HEY on their iPhone and they wanna switch to Android.

But that billing relationship, it's tied to Apple,

it's complete hell.

For a million reasons,

I did not want to hand my business over to Apple.

I did not want to hand 30% of our revenue over to Apple.

So we decided to do something

that seemingly Apple had never heard before.

We said no, we're not gonna add the in-app payment.

I don't care if you're threatening us.

this is not fair,

this is not reasonable, please approve.

And of course they didn't and it escalated.

And after a couple of days we realized, you know what?

This isn't a mistake.

This isn't going away.

We're gonna be dead if they go through with this.

If we're not gonna yield and give them the 30%,

they're gonna kick us off unless we make such a racket

such noise that they will regret it.

And that's exactly what then happened.

We were blessed by the fact that we launched HEY

one week before the WWDC,

their Worldwide Developer Conference.

Where Apple loves to get up on stage

and harp on how much they do for developers,

how much they love them

and why you should bill for their new devices

and so on and so forth.

And then we also just happened

to have a platform on the internet,

which is very convenient when you need to go to war

with a $3 trillion company.

So I started kicking and screaming

- Oh boy. - And essentially

turning it up to 11 in terms of the fight

and going public with our or denial to be in the app store.

And that turned into a prolonged

two week battle with Apple

that essentially ended in the best possible outcome

we could have gotten as David fighting Goliath,

which was a bit of a truce.

We wouldn't hand 30% over to Apple.

They do wouldn't kick us out of the app store,

but we had to build some bullshit dummy account

such that the app did something when you downloaded it.

That was a rule that Phil Schiller seemingly made up

on the fly when pressed for the fifth time

by the media about why we couldn't be in the app store

when a million other companion apps could.

But we just happened to be able to create so much pain

and noise for Apple that it was easier for them

to just let us be than to keep on fighting.

- What do you think about Tim Sweeney's victory

with Epic over Apple?

- I think it is incredible

and the entire developer ecosystem.

Not just on iOS but on Android as well,

owe Epic, Tim Sweeney

and Mark Rein, an enormous debt of gratitude

for taking on the only battle

that has ever inflicted a series wound on Apple

in this entire sorted campaign of monopoly enforcement.

And that is Epic's fight versus them.

Tim recently revealed

that it has cost well over a hundred million dollars

in legal fees to carry on this battle against Apple.

We, for a hot moment, considered suing Apple

when they were threatening to kick us out.

We shopped the case around with a few law firms

and perhaps of course they would tell us

you have a good case.

I mean they're trying to sell a product here,

but they would also tell us.

- It's gonna cost a minimum of $10 million

and it's gonna take five

to seven years through all the appeals.

Now we now learned the actual price tag

was 10 times higher, right?

Epic spend over 100 million.

It would've destroyed us

to take on Apple in the legal realm.

Only a company like Epic could do it

and only a company run by founders Like Tim,

like Mark could risk the business

in the way that they did,

the audacity they had to provoke

the fight in the first place,

which I thought was just incredible.

And to stick with it for the long term,

no board would've signed off on this lawsuit

to a professional CEO, no freaking way.

So the fact that they've been able to beat Apple

in also the most hilarious way possible,

I think it's just incredible.

'Cause remember their first victory

in the case was actually not much of a victory.

There were about 11 counts in the trial.

Apple basically won 10 of them

and the judge awarded Epic this one little win

that Apple couldn't tell 'em not to link out to the internet

to be able to do the payment processing.

So they won this one little thing.

And Apple, instead of just taking the 10 out of 11 wins

and going fine, you can have your little links

but all these other rules stay in place

decided to essentially commit criminal contempt of court

as they've now been referred to for prosecution

and angered the judge to such a degree

that the rule of law in the US now

is that you can launch an app in the app store.

And you don't have to use in-app payment,

but you can have a direct billing relationship

with a customer if you just link out to the open internet

when you take the credit card

and then hop back into the app.

And we owe all of that to Tim and Mark.

We owe all of that to Epic.

We're gonna launch new apps any minute now,

I hope actually next week to take advantage of this

that revamp the hey apps so that people

who download the Hey app off the Apple app store

can sign up in the app and can then use the web

to put in their credit card so we don't have to pay 30%.

Instead we have a direct billing relationship

and such that they can take that subscription to Android,

to PCs, whatever without any hassle.

And we have Tim and Mark to thank for it.

- Yeah, Tim, I mean, like you said founders

but also specific kind of founders.

'Cause I think maybe you can educate me on this,

but Tim is somebody who maintains.

to this day sort of the unreasonableness of principles.

Yes, that's what I love.

I think sometimes maybe even

with founders you can get worn down.

It's a large company.

There's a lot of smart, quote, unquote,

people around you lawyers and just whispering

your ear over time

and you're like, well just be reasonable being a, you know,

this is a different thing.

And to be the sort of maintain,

I mean Steve Jobs did this.

Still are the asshole.

Who' says, "No,

I'll sink this whole fucking company over this."

- That's the exact language basically I used

in our original campaign.

I will burn this business down

before I hand over 30% of it to Apple.

And that sort of indignation,

that actual rage is something I try

to be a little careful about tapping into

because it is a little bit of a volatile compound.

Because I mean I have a bunch of employees,

we have a bunch of customers.

It would be pretty sad if the journey of 37 signals

after 25 years would come to an end

because Apple would burn us down

or I would burn the business down

over this fight with Apple.

But I think you also need that level of conviction

to be able to even drive the day-to-day decisions.

One of the other Apple examples,

and I know we're racking on Apple a little bit here,

and I don't actually hate them.

I really don't.

I am tremendously disappointed

at the squandered relationship that did not need

to be sold away for so little.

Now I understand that the app store toll booth

is actually a pretty big business.

It's multiple billions,

but Apple is a trillion dollar company.

And I think in the lens of history,

this is gonna come off as a tremendous mistake

and I think it's already coming off as a tremendous mistake.

The flop that was the Vision Pro

was partly because Apple had pissed off

# Chapter 17

or I would burn the business down

over this fight with Apple.

But I think you also need that level of conviction

to be able to even drive the day-to-day decisions.

One of the other Apple examples,

and I know we're racking on Apple a little bit here,

and I don't actually hate them.

I really don't.

I am tremendously disappointed

is actually a pretty big business.

It's multiple billions,

but Apple is a trillion dollar company.

And I think in the lens of history,

this is gonna come off as a tremendous mistake

and I think it's already coming off as a tremendous mistake.

The flop that was the Vision Pro

was partly because Apple had pissed off

every other developer.

No one was eager to come build the kind of experiences

for their new hardware

that would perhaps have made it a success.

So when you're on top and you have all the cards,

you can dilute yourself into thinking

that you can dictate all terms at all times

and there are no long term consequences.

Apple is learning finally,

the fact that there are long-term consequences

and that developers actually

are important to Apple's business.

And the relationship is not entirely one sided.

We don't owe our existence to Apple and Apple alone.

We've built our own customer bases.

Apple has been beneficial to the industry.

I'm glad the iPhone exists, da da da da.

It's not that it doesn't go both ways,

but Apple wants it only one way.

And I think that is a mistake,

and it's a mistake that was avoidable.

And A, that's disappointing.

Certainly disappointing for me.

I've literally spent 20 years

evangelizing this shit, right?

I've spent so much money buying Apple hardware,

excusing a bunch of things they've done over the years.

And then for what?

For the fact that you wanted 30% of something

that I created in the most unreasonable way possible?

Couldn't we have found a better way to do this?

I think they're going to get forced to do a better way.

But did you also have to go through the indignity

of having a criminal contempt charge

against you getting referred to prosecution?

It just seems so beneath Apple,

but it also seems so in line

with what happens to huge companies

who are run by, quote, unquote, "professional managers"

rather than founders and unreasonable people.

- Well, we should probably also say

that the thing you love about Apple,

the great spirit of Apple I think still persists

and there's a case to be made that this 30% thing

is a slice, a particular slice of a company,

not a defining aspect of the company.

And that it Apple is still on top in the hardware

that it makes and a lot of things that it makes.

And you know this is, that could be just a hiccup

in a long story of a great company

that does a lot of awesome stuff for humanity.

So like Apple is a truly special company.

We mentioned Amazon, there is no company like Apple.

- I agree, this is why the disappointment

is all greater.

Because we had such high aspirations

and expectations to Apple

that they were the shining city on the hill

and they were guiding the industry

in a million positive ways.

I think as we talked about earlier,

hardware is exciting again

in large part because Apple bought PA Semi

and pursued a against all odds

mission to get ARM up to the level it is today.

And we have these incredible M chips now because of it.

And the design sensibilities

that Apple bring to the table are unparalleled.

No one has taste certainly at the hardware level

like Apple does, even at the software level.

I'd say there's a lot of taste left in Apple,

but there's also some real sour taste now.

So they have to wash that off first I think

before they find their wear back.

But Apple's been in a mirage before,

I mean Wozniak and Steve Jobs

started this thing in the garage,

has great success with the Apple II.

He hands the company over to a sugar drink salesman

who tanks the company into the '90s.

He doesn't learn the lesson,

spends the next 20 years building up this amazing company,

then hands the company over again to a logistics person

who presumably had more redeeming qualities

than the first guy who put in charge,

but still ends up leading the company astray.

Now this is the norm.

The norm is that great companies don't last forever.

In the long arc of history,

almost no company lasts forever.

There are very few companies around

that was here 100 years ago,

even fewer 200 years ago.

And virtually nothing that are 1000 years old

outside of a handful of Japanese sorts makers

or something like that, right?

So you can get diluted into thinking

that something is forever when you're in the moment.

And they seem so large.

Apple could absolutely stumble

and I think they have more reason to stumble now than ever.

They're behind on AI, terribly behind.

Their software quality is faltering in a bunch of ways.

The competition is catching up on the hardware game

in part because TSMC is not an Apple subsidiary,

but a foundry that services a MD and NVIDIA and others

who are now able to use the same kind of advanced processes.

This is something I learned

after not looking at PC hardware for the longest time,

that holy smokes, AMD actually makes CPUs

that are just as fast, if not faster than apples.

They're not quite as efficient yet

because ARM has some fundamental efficiencies over x86,

but they're still pretty good.

So Apple should have reason to worry.

Apple's shareholders should have reason to be concerned.

Not just about all these stumbles,

but also by the fact that Apple is run by old people.

Apple's board has an average age of, I think, 75.

Their entire executive team is above 60.

Now that sounds horribly ageist.

And in some ways, it a little bit is.

In the same way, I'm ageist against myself.

Like I'm 45 now and I sort of kind of have to force myself

to really get into AI because it is such a paradigm shift

and a lot of people when they reach a certain age

are just happy to stay with what they know.

They don't wanna go back to being a beginner.

They don't wanna go back to having to relearn everything.

And I think like, ah, this is a little hard for me at 45.

How the hell do you do that at 75?

- I have to come back to, you mentioned it earlier,

you're a parent.

Can you speak to the impact that becoming a father

has had on your life?

- I think what's funny about fatherhood is that for me,

I wasn't even sure it's something I wanted.

It took meeting the right woman

and letting her convince me

That this was the right idea before we even got started.

I didn't have starting my own family

on the list of priorities

in my late 20s or even early 30s.

It was really the impetus of meeting my wife Jamie

and her telling me this is what I want.

I wanna have a family.

I wanna get married.

I wanna have kids.

I wanna have three.

And me going for a second like whoa, whoa, whoa.

And then eh, all right, let's do it.

And I think that's the kind of happy accident

where some parts of my life have been very driven,

where I knew exactly what I wanted

and how to push forward to it

and what the payoff was going to be.

But when it comes to having a family,

that always felt like a very fuzzy abstract idea

that sure, someday, maybe.

And then it became very concrete

because I met a woman who knew what she wanted.

And looking back on it now,

it almost seems crazy.

Like there's this fork in the road of reality.

Where if that hadn't happened

and I had been sitting here now,

not being a father, not having a family,

the level of regret knowing what I know now about

the joys of having that family

would've been existential, would've been...

I don't know if they would've been devastating.

I think men have a little bit of a longer window

to pursue these things than women do.

There are just certain biological facts.

But ending up with the family I have now,

ending up with my three boys have been

just a transformative experience in the sense

that here's something that turned out

to be the most important thing.

And it was an open secret.

Not even an open secret.

It was an open truth through all of history.

You listen to anyone who's ever had children,

they will all say,

"My children are the most important to me."

Yet somehow that wisdom couldn't sink in

until you were in the situation yourself.

I find those truths fascinating

when you can't actually relay them with words.

I can tell you, Hey Lex, what are you doing?

Get a wife,

make some kids,

get a move on it.

And these are just words.

They're not communicating the gravity

of what it actually feels to go through the experience.

And you can't really learn it without going through it.

Now of course you could be influenced and whatever,

we can all help contribute and little sparks

and little seeds can grow in your your mind about it.

But it still has to happen.

And now that I am in this situation

and just the sheer joy on a daily basis

where you think your level of life satisfaction

is on a scale of one to 10,

and then the satisfaction

of seeing your children understand something,

accomplish something, learn something,

do something, just be.

Just goes like, oh my god,

the scale doesn't go from one to 10.

It goes from one to 100.

And I've been playing down here

in the one to 10 range all this time.

And there's a one to 100

that has been humbling

in a way that is impactful in and of itself.

This whole idea that I thought I had a fair understanding

of like the boundaries of life in my early 30s,

like what is this about?

I mean, I've been on this earth long enough now

here to know something.

And you realize, I don't know, I did not know.

I did not know that the scale was much broader.

And I've often talked about joys of having kids

and just seeing your own DNA,

which is remarkable to me

because literally that's been the pursuit of humans

since the dawn of time.

I am here today because whatever, 30,000 years ago,

some Neanderthal had the same realization

that I should procreate

and I should continue my bloodline.

And that that all amounts to me sitting here now.

But it didn't become a practical reality to me

before meeting the right woman.

And I think that that's sometimes

not part of the conversation enough

that there's something broken at the moment

about how people pair up in the western world.

And it's at the source of why

we're not having enough children

because there's not enough couples,

there's not enough marriage.

There's not a lot of these...

There's not enough of all these traditional values

that even 50, 60, 70 years ago

was just taken for granted.

We're in this grand experiment

of what happens if we just remove a bunch of institutions?

What happens if we no longer value marriage

as a something to aspire to?

What happened if parenthood is now seen in some camps?

It's almost something like weird

or against your own self-expression.

It's a grand experiment

that I'm kind of curious how it turns out.

I prefer to watch it as a movie

like the "Children of Men," I'm like, that was a good show.

I kind of wish that wasn't reality.

But we're seeing that reality play out

while I'm sitting here in a very traditional

two parent loving household with three children,

and going, this is now at the top.

I've done a lot of things in my life.

I've built software, I've built companies,

I've raced cars, I've done all sorts of things,

and I would trade all of it in a heartbeat for my kids.

That's just a really fascinating human experience

that the depth of that bond

is something you can't appreciate before you have it.

But I also think there is a role to play, to talk it up.

Because we're being bombarded constantly

with reasons why not to.

Oh, it's too expensive.

Well, you could get divorced and then you might lose half.

There's all these voices

constantly articulating the case against marriage,

the case against having children

that those of us who've chosen to do the traditional thing

to get married and to have children have an obligation

to kind of talk it up a little bit,

which would've seen ridiculous again 50 years ago

that you'd have to talk up

something so fundamental of that.

But I have become kind of obligated

in that sense to do just that.

To talk it up, to say, you know what?

You can look at everything that I've done

and if you like some of those parts

realize that to me in this situation,

the kids, the family, the wife

is more important than all of it.

And it sounds like a cliche

because you've heard it a thousand times before.

And by becoming a cliche,

maybe you start believing it's not true

that it's just something people say, but it is reality.

I know almost no parents

that I have personal relationships with

that don't consider their children

to be the most important thing in their life.

- So there's a lot of interesting things you said.

So one, it does seem to be,

I know a lot of parents,

perhaps more interestingly,

I know a lot of super successful people who are parents

who really love their kids

and who say that the kids even help them

to be more successful.

Now the interesting thing,

speaking to what you're saying

is it does seem for us humans,

it's easier to articulate the negatives

because they're sort of concrete, pragmatic, you know,

it costs more, it takes some time, you know,

they can be, you know, crying all over the place.

They're, you know, tiny narcissists

running around or whatever.

- Which is all true.

- Yeah, pooping everywhere, that kind of stuff.

But to articulate the thing you were speaking to

of there's this little creature

that you love more than anything

# Chapter 18

I know a lot of parents,

perhaps more interestingly,

I know a lot of super successful people who are parents

who really love their kids

and who say that the kids even help them

to be more successful.

Now the interesting thing,

speaking to what you're saying

is it does seem for us humans,

it's easier to articulate the negatives

because they're sort of concrete, pragmatic, you know,

it costs more, it takes some time, you know,

they can be, you know, crying all over the place.

They're, you know, tiny narcissists

running around or whatever.

- Which is all true.

- Yeah, pooping everywhere, that kind of stuff.

But to articulate the thing you were speaking to

of there's this little creature

that you love more than anything

you've ever loved in your life.

It's hard to convert that into words.

You have to really experience it.

But I believe it and I want to experience that,

but I believe 'cause just from a scientific method,

have seen a lot of people

who are not honestly not very capable of love,

fall completely in love with their kids.

Like, you know, very sort of...

let's just call it what it is, engineers

that are very like boop bop.

They just fall in love.

And it's like, all right, people who just like you said,

they don't really want, they don't really care

or don't really think about having kids that kind of stuff

once they do it changes everything.

So, you know, but it's hard to convert it into words.

- One of the reasons I think

is also difficult is, I mean, I like kids.

Not that I actively disliked them,

but when I was around other people's kids,

I didn't have a emotional reaction.

Some women have, right?

They see a baby and they go, "Oh."

I never had any emotion of that.

I mean, I could appreciate,

I'm glad for you that you have children.

It did not provoke anything in me.

The emotions that are provoked in me

when I look at my own children,

this doesn't exist in the same universe.

So you don't have something,

you don't have a complete parallel,

or at least a lot of men,

or at least me, I didn't have sort of a framework

to put it into what would it be like to have my own child?

And then you experience it.

It's like the poof.

And it happens so quickly too.

This is what I found fascinating.

It happens before that little human

is even able to return any words to you

that the love you develop to an infant,

it happens quite quickly.

Not necessarily immediately, I don't know,

different people have different experiences,

but it took me a little bit.

But then once it hit, it just hit like kick of a horse.

And I love that it's also just such a universal experience.

That you can be the most successful person in the world.

You can be the poorest person in the world.

You can be somewhere in the middle.

And we share this experience that being a parent,

for most of them,

turns out to be the most important thing in their life.

- But you know, it is really nice

to do that kind of experience with the right partner.

But I think because I'm such an empath,

the cost of having the wrong partner is high for me.

But then I also like realized, man,

I have a friend of mine who's divorced happily

and he still loves the shit out of his kids.

And it's still beautiful.

It's a mess, but there's all of that love is still there

and it's, you know, you just have to make it work.

It's just that, I don't know,

that kind of like divorce would destroy me.

- You should listen to The School of Life.

He has this great bit on YouTube.

You'll marry the wrong person.

If you accept upfront that you will marry the wrong person,

that every potential person you can marry

is gonna be the wrong person on some dimension.

They're gonna annoy you.

They're gonna be not what you hoped in certain dimensions.

The romantic ideal

that everything is just perfect all the time

is not very conducive to the reality

of hitching up and get making babies.

Because I think as you just accounted,

even when it turns to shit,

I find that most of the people I personally know

where things have fallen apart

and have turned to shit,

never in a million years would they go like, "I regret it."

"I would rather, my children did not exist

because a relationship turned sour."

I mean, I think you should try very hard.

And I think this is also one of those things

where we didn't fully understand those fences.

And when we pulled them up

and celebrated how easy it is to get divorced, for example,

that that wasn't gonna have some negative consequences.

I'm not saying you shouldn't have divorces.

I'm not saying return to times past.

I'm saying though that civilization

over thousands of years developed certain technologies

for ensuring the continuation of its own institutions

and its own life that perhaps we didn't fully appreciate.

I mean, again, this is something Jordan Peterson

and others are far more articulate to speak about,

and that I've learned a lot

to just analyze my own situation.

Why is it that this incredible burden,

it is to be responsible for someone else's life

that you brought into this world

is also the most rewarding part of existence?

That's just curious.

Before I heard Peterson articulate the value

of taking on the greatest burden you know how to carry,

I always thought about burdens as a negative things.

Why would I want the burden of a child?

I might screw it up.

I might be a bad parent.

They might have bad... all this stuff, right?

All the reasons why you shouldn't.

And so few voices articulating why you should.

- Yeah, but there I should also add

on top of that thing you mentioned

currently, perhaps in the west,

the matchmaking process is broken.

Is broken and technology made it worse.

Yeah, it's fascinating.

This whole thing that that hasn't been solved.

So hiring great teams,

that's probably been solved the best out of matchmaking.

Finding great people to hire.

Second, finding great friends.

That's like, that's also hasn't been solved.

- And it's breaking down. - It's breaking down.

And third is matchmaking

for like relationships.

That's like the worst.

And in fact, technology made it even worse.

It's fascinating.

- It is.

It's a great example again

of how all the greatest intentions

still led us straight to hell.

I really enjoyed Louis Perry's analysis

of the sexual revolution not being an unqualified good,

which was something I hadn't thought about at all

before she articulated it.

That of course women

should be able to have freedom and self determination

and abortions and all of these things.

And Louise Perry is not arguing

against that either, of course.

But there are second order facts

that we don't appreciate at the time

and we may not have ready-made solutions for.

And that's just interesting.

You make life better in a million different ways

and somehow we end up more miserable.

Why is that?

Why is it that humans find meaning in hardship?

And I think some of that

is that it's a difficult question

to answers through science.

And again, Peterson articulates well

this idea that you have to find some of it through art,

some of it through authors,

some of it through different...

I was just about to say modes of knowing

before I stopped myself,

because that sounds like woo bullshit.

But there are different ways

to acquire those deep lessons

that sort of paper is not gonna tell you.

- I mean, this is really,

the point also applies to religion, for example.

If you remove from society the software of religion,

you better have a good replacement.

- And we've had a bunch of bad replacements,

especially over the last few decades.

Religion is one of those things I've struggled with a lot

because I'm not religious.

I sort of wish I was.

I can now fully appreciate the enormous value

having an operating system like that

brings not just at the individual level,

but rather at a societal level.

And it's not clear at all what the answer is.

I think we've tried a lot of dead ends

when it came to replacements

and people have been filling that void

in a million different ways that seem worse

than all the religions,

despite their faults in a myriad of ways

have been able to deliver.

- Yeah, religions like the cobalt code.

It's just... - Yes,

it's the institutions

where we don't fully understand the rules

and why they're there

and what's gonna happen if we remove them.

Yeah, some of them seems obvious to me

are just bullshit of the time.

Oh, you should need whatever shellfish,

because in that region of the world.

There was something, something, something, okay, fine.

But there's a bunch of other things

that are pivotal to keeping society functioning

for the long term,

and we don't fully understand which is which.

What's the bullshit

and what's the load-bearing pillars of society.

- Can you speak to the hit on productivity that kids have?

Did they increase your productivity, decrease it,

or is that even the wrong question to ask?

- I think it's one of the reasons

why ambitious people are often afraid of having children

because they think I have so much more to do

and I barely have enough time now.

How would I possibly be able to accomplish the things

I wanna accomplish if I add another human into the mix?

Now, A, we've always worked 40 hours a week,

not 80 or 100 or 120.

I think that's very beneficial.

B, kids don't exist in this vacuum

of just them alone being entered into your life.

Hopefully there's a partner.

And in my life, I'm married to a wonderful woman

who decided to stop working her corporate job

when we got together

and have been able to carry

a huge part of that responsibility.

I was just about to say burden.

And I think that's exactly how it often gets presented,

especially from a feminist perspective,

that carrying for your own children

is some sort of unpaid labor

that has to be compensated for in some specific way

beyond the compensation

of what bringing life into this world,

racing wonderful humans.

There's something screwy about that analysis

that I actually think the modern trad movement

is a reply against.

Whether they have all the answers,

I'm certainly not sure of either.

But there's something that's just not right

in the analysis that children are a burden

and that if woman chooses to stay at home with the kids,

that that some sort of failure mode of feminist ambition.

I think that's actually a complete dead end.

Now depends on different people, different circumstances.

I can just speak to my life

being married to a wonderful woman

who have decided to be home with the kids,

at least at their early age

and taking on a lot of those responsibilities.

Now it doesn't mean there isn't plenty of ways

that I have to be part of that and have to chip in,

but it's allowed me to continue

to work the 40 hours a week that I've always worked.

But it's made the 40 hours more strict.

I have a schedule where I wake up, whatever, 6:30

and we have to get out of the door a little before 8:00.

I usually have to play

at least one or two rounds of "Fortnite"

with my youngest and sometimes middle child.

Then take the kids to school,

get in, start work at, I don't know, 8:39.

Didn't work until 5:00, 5:30, sometimes six o'clock.

But then it's dinner and I have to be there for that.

And then I have to read to the kids

and by the time that's done,

I don't want to go back to work.

So my work time really is 9:00 to 5:00, 9:00 to 6:00,

depending of whatever is going on.

Sometimes there's emergencies

and you have to tend to them,

but it's made it more structured.

And I found some benefit in that

and I've found some productivity in that,

that I can't goof around quite as much

that the day will end at around 5:36.

That's just if I didn't accomplish

what I wanted to do today,

if I get to that time, it's done.

I'm over, I have to try again tomorrow.

Whereas before having a family and before having kids,

I could just like not do it

and just make it up in the evening.

So in that way it's made me more structured,

but it hasn't really changed

my volume of work all that much.

I still work about the same amount of hours.

And that's, by the way, enough.

This is one of the key points we make in.

It doesn't have to be crazy at work.

The latest book we wrote is that there's enough time.

40 hours a week is actually a ton

if you don't piss it away.

Most people do piss it away.

They piss it away in meetings.

They piss it away on just stuff that doesn't matter

when even three hours, four hours

of concentrated uninterrupted time every day

would move to goals they truly care about

way down the field.

- I think kids do make you more productive

in that way for people who need it,

especially people like me.

They create their urgency.

Lik if you have to be done by 5:00,

it's a maybe counterintuitive notion,

but for people like me who like to work,

you can really fill the day with fluff of work.

And if you have to be done by 5:00,

you're going to have to do the deep work and get it done.

Like really focus singular work.

And then you're just gonna cut off all the pressure.

- It keeps you honest.

It keeps you honest because you can squander one day,

you can squander two days.

But if I squander a whole week, I feel terrible.

Now that's just some drive I have in me

where I feel content and full meaning

if I actually do stuff that matters,

if I can look back upon the week

and go like that was a nice week, really.

We moved forward.

Maybe we didn't get done,

but we moved forward and everything got better.

And I think kids really helped

just time box things in that way.

And a lot of people need that

because I find just so much of the celebration

of overwork to be so tiresome.

Oh, I work 60 hours or 80 hours or 100 hours a week

and just like, first of all, no, you don't.

No, you don't.

Like those 80 hours are full

of all sorts of fluff that you label work,

but that I would laugh at

and that most people laugh at.

That you would laugh at if you actually did the analysis

of where's that time going.

Most of the important stuff that has to be done

is done in these uninterrupted chunks

of two hours here or four hours there or five hours there.

The hard part is making sure

you get them in the whole piece.

So don't give me that.

There's time enough.

And also what's so important that it ranks

# Chapter 19

And a lot of people need that

because I find just so much of the celebration

of overwork to be so tiresome.

Oh, I work 60 hours or 80 hours or 100 hours a week

and just like, first of all, no, you don't.

No, you don't.

Like those 80 hours are full

of all sorts of fluff that you label work,

but that I would laugh at

and that most people laugh at.

That you would laugh at if you actually did the analysis

of where's that time going.

Most of the important stuff that has to be done

is done in these uninterrupted chunks

of two hours here or four hours there or five hours there.

The hard part is making sure

you get them in the whole piece.

So don't give me that.

There's time enough.

And also what's so important that it ranks

above continuing your lineage.

I think there's just some ancient honor

in the fact that, again,

this DNA that's sitting on this chair

traveled 30,000 years to get here

and you're gonna squander all that away

just so you can send a few more emails.

- There is something that's also hard

to convert into words of just the kind of fun

you can have just playing with your kids.

I don't know what that on the surface it's like,

I can have that kind of fun

just playing video games by myself.

But no, it's like there's something magical about it, right?

- I have a thousand hours logged in "Fortnite"

since 19, I think,

all of it with my kids.

I'd never be playing "Fortnite."

Well, I don't know if I never would be.

I wouldn't be playing a thousand hours of "Fortnite"

if it wasn't for my kids.

The enjoyment for me is to do

something with them that I also happen to enjoy.

I really love "Fortnite."

It's a phenomenal game.

I don't have to force myself to play that with them.

I often ask like, hey, do you wanna play "Fortnite?"

But still, it's an activity that I get to share with them.

It's a passion that I get to share with them.

I've started doing go-karting with my oldest.

I've been driving race cars for a long time

and now they're getting into go-karting

and just being at the go-kart track,

seeing them go around,

seeing them get faster, seeing them learn that skill,

you just go look at like,

what else would I be doing with my life?

At my age, 45, I'm standing here truly enjoying life.

I brought into this world.

What else was so important at this stage

that I would otherwise be spending my time on?

- All right, like you mentioned, you like to race cars

and you do it at a world class competitive level,

which is incredible.

So how'd you get into it?

What attracts you to racing?

What do you love about it?

- The funny thing about getting into racing

is I did not get my driver's license until I was 25.

I grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark,

where the tax on cars is basically over 200%.

So you pay for three cars and you get one.

And I didn't even have the money for one car,

let alone three.

So I could not afford a car growing up.

We did not have a car growing up,

but Copenhagen is a nice city

to be able to get around on a bike or with a bus,

or as I did for a long period of time, on roller blades.

But when I was 25,

I realized I wanted to spend more time in the US.

I wasn't sure yet that I was gonna move there.

That turned out later to be true.

But I knew that if I wanted to spend time in the US,

I needed to have a driver's license.

I was not gonna get around very

well if I didn't know how to drive a car.

So I got a driver's license at 25.

Then ended up moving to the US later that year

and I'd always been into video games, racing video games,

"Metropolitan Street Racer" on the Dreamcast

was one of those games that really sucked me into.

It was the precursor to Project Gotham,

which was the precursor

to essentially, Forza Horizon, I think.

- Oh, okay, interesting.

- I think that's how the lineage goes.

Just a great game.

I actually just fired it up on an emulator

a few weeks ago.

And it still sort of kind of holds up

because it has enough real car dynamics

that it smells a little bit like driving a real car.

It's not just like an arcade racer

like Sega Rally or something like that.

But I'd always been into that.

Then I got my driver's license at 25 and moved to the US,

and then two years later,

a friend that I'd met in Chicago

took me to the Chicago Autobahn Country Club,

which is this great track,

about 45 minutes from Chicago.

And I sat in a race car

and I drove a race car for the first time.

And I had the same kind of pseudo religious experience

I did as when I started working on Ruby,

where I did maybe 20 laps

in this basically a Mazda race car

from, I think, it was like the '90s or something,

like a pretty cheap race car, but a real race car.

Single seat, manual gearbox,

but exposed slick wheels, all the stuff.

And after having had that experience,

first of all it was just the most amazing thing ever.

Like the physical sensation of driving a race car

is really unique.

And I think if you've driven a car fast,

you have a maybe a 2% taste of it.

The exposure to the elements

that you get in a single seat race car,

especially one like that where your head

is actually out in the elements,

you can see the individual wheels

and you sensation of speed

is just so much higher is at a completely different level.

- So can you actually speak to that?

So even at that Mazda, so you can feel,

what can you feel like the track

reverberating you see? You feel the grip?

- Oh yeah, not only can you see the bumps

because you're literally looking straight at the wheel,

you can feel all the bumps

because you're running a slick tire.

It's a really stiff setup.

It's nothing like taking a fast street car

out on a racetrack and try to driving a little bit around.

- So can you feel like the slipping,

the traction? - Yeah, you feel the slipping.

hat's a huge part of the satisfaction

of driving a race car

is driving in at the edge of adhesion as we call it.

Where the car's actually sliding a little bit.

A couple of percent of slip angle

is the fastest way to drive a race car.

You don't wanna slide too much that looks great,

lots of smoke, but it's not fast.

How you want to drive it is just at the limit of adhesion

where you're rotating the car

as much as your tires can manage.

And then slightly more than that and playing at it,

keeping it just at that level.

Because when you're at the level

or at the limit of adhesion,

you're essentially just a tiny movement away

from spinning out.

I mean, it doesn't take much.

Then the car starts rotating.

Once it starts rotating,

you lose grip and you're going for the wall.

That balance of danger and skill

is what's so intoxicating.

And it's so much better than racing video games too,

because the criticality is taking up two notches.

I often think about people who really like gambling,

where I think like, aren't you just playing poker?

Like no, the point is not poker.

Pokers may be part of it,

but the point is that I could lose my house, right?

Like that's the addiction that some people get to gambling,

that there's something real on the line.

When you're in a race car,

there's something very real on the line.

If you get it wrong,

at the very least,

you're gonna spin out and properly hit a wall

and it's gonna be expensive.

At the very worst, you're not getting out alive.

And even if modern race cars have gotten way safer

than they used to be.

There is that element of danger that's real.

That there are people who still get seriously hurt

or even killed in a race car.

It's mercifully rare compared to what it used to be

when those maniacs in the '60s

would do Formula 1 and whatever,

13% of the grid wouldn't make it to the end of the year

because they'd just die in a fiery flaming fireball.

But there's still some of it there.

And I think that since that there's something on the line

really contributes to it.

But it's more than that.

There's just a physical sensation.

There's activation of all your forces.

There's the flow.

And I think that really cements like why I got addicted,

'cause I always, I love that flow

I got out of programming,

but getting flow out of programming

is a very inconsistent process.

I can't just sit down in front of a keyboard

and go like, all right,

let's get the flow going.

It doesn't happen like that.

The problem has to be just right.

It has to meet my skills in just a right moment.

It's a bit of a lottery.

In a race car is not a lottery at all.

You sit down in that car, you turn the ignition,

you go out on track,

and I get flow virtually guaranteed.

Because you need, or I need at least

100% of my brain processing power

to be able to go at the speed I go without crashing.

So there's no time to think about the other night

or the meeting next week or product launch.

It's completely zen

in actually the literal sense of the word.

I think of someone who's really good at meditation,

that's probably kind of state they get

into where it's just clear you're in the now,

there's nothing but you and the next corner.

That's a really addictive experience.

So after I've had that, I couldn't get enough.

I kept going to the track every opportunity I got.

Every single weekend for about four years,

I would go to the track.

And by the end of that time,

I'd finally worked up enough skill

and enough success with the company

that I could afford to go, quote, unquote, "real racing."

So I started doing that.

I started driving these Porsches,

and then as soon as I got into that,

as soon as I got into, quote, unquote, "real competition,"

I was like, I wonder how far you can take this.

And it didn't take that long

before I decided, you know what?

I can take this all the way.

My great hero in racing is Tom Kristensen, fellow Dane.

The Mr. Le Mans, as they call him.

The greatest endurance race in the world.

The 24 hours of Le Mans has been won more times

than any other by Tom Kristensen.

He won the race nine times.

So Tom just really turned me onto Le Mans.

I've been watching Le Mans since I think the '80s.

I have my earliest memories of watching that on TV.

The race has been going since I think 20s.

But in the '80s I got kind of into it.

And then in the late '90s,

early 2000s when Tom started winning,

I like pretty much every other Dane

started watching the race almost religiously.

So I thought, you know what?

I wanna get to Le Mans.

And this is the magic thing about racing,

that if I get into basketball,

like I can't set a realistic expectation

that I'm gonna play in the NBA,

then I'm gonna go to the finals.

Or I get into tennis and I'm gonna play at Wimbledon,

that just doesn't happen.

But racing thing is special in this way

because it requires a fair amount of money

to keep these cars running.

It's really expensive.

It's like having a small startup.

You need to fly a bunch of people around the world

and buy expensive equipment and so forth.

So you need a bunch of capital.

And I had some through the success of the company.

So I could do it, which meant that I could get to Le Mans.

So I set that as my goal.

I wanna get to Le Mans.

And I started racing in real competition 2009.

And three years later in 2012,

I was at the grid of Le Mans for the first time.

- We should say, so Le Mans, 24-hour race endurance.

I mean, this is insane.

- There are three drivers, mind you.

So it's not like one guy just drive for 20 hours,

24 hours straight.

But still, it's a pretty tough race

both physically and mentally, especially mentally.

When you've been up for 24 plus hours,

you're not quite as sharp as when you first wake up.

And this is funny about Le Mans too.

It starts at around four o'clock in the afternoon.

So you've already been up for half a day

by the time the race starts.

And then there's 24 hours to go before you're done.

And you'll be in the car for anywhere

from usually an hour and a half

to a maximum of four hours.

The regulations say four out of six is the max you can do.

I've spent perhaps two and a half hours

in a single stint at Le Mans.

It's pretty taxing.

You're going 200 miles an hour

into some of these turns,

and there's another 60 cars on track.

Whenever I'm in my normal category,

which is the LMP2 category,

I have GT cars, which are more like a Ferrari and a Porsche

that I have to overtake.

And then I have these hypercar,

which is the top class that are overtaking me.

So you got a lot going on and you gotta stay sharp

for two and a half hours straight to do that.

That is just a guaranteed way to get incredible flow

for long, long stretches of time.

That's why you get addicted to it.

That was why I got addicted.

- You gotta talk me through this video.

This video of you in these LMP2s.

- Oh, yes. - This is such a cool.

This is so cool.

- And this was probably my favorite battle of my career.

- [Commentator] And Heinemeier Hansson

has beat past to add five...

- Yeah, so this is me driving against Nico Muller

at the Shanghai International Circuit.

- You're on the outside here? - I'm on the outside in the...

- How cool is it? - Blue and white.

And we go a whole track around

with basically a piece of paper

between a seat down this back straight.

I get so close to him because I wanna force him over

on the other side of the track,

such that he can't just box me in.

And we've been fighting already

at this point for basically 40 minutes straight.

I've been managing to keep this professional driver

behind me for 40 minutes.

And he finally passes me,

but we just keep the battle on for the whole time.

And it really just shows both these kinds of cars.

The Le Mans prototypes.

We don't actually ever touch.

We get within about an inch.

And keep going around

Shanghai circuit too. - What a cool.

How did you get so good? Like what?

I mean that's a fascinating story, right?

That you are able to get so good.

- I'm pretty good for the kind of driver I am,

which is called the gentleman driver,

which means I'm not a professional driver.

And like many good gentlemen drivers,

when we're at our really best,

we can be quite competitive with even professional drivers

who have been doing this their whole life.

The difference between us and the professionals

is the professionals could do it every time

or more or less every time.

So I can't be this good all the time.

When everything is just right,

I can be competitive with professional drivers,

but that's not how you win championships.

That's not how you get paid by factories to drive.

You gotta be good every time you go out.

So that's a huge difference.

But some of it was also just, I really put my mind to it

by the time I realized race cars

is what I want to do as my serious hobby.

I put in thousands of hours.

- Have you crashed?

What's the worst crash?

- I've had a lot of crashes,

but thankfully, knock on wood,

I haven't had any crashes

where I've gotten really seriously hurt.

- Have you like wrecked the car?

- Oh yes, oh yes.

I've wrecked many car.

- So what's that feel like?

Just you wreck a car.

Like how do you get...

- It feels like total shit

if you're in a real race and other people depend on you.

It's not even so much to car,

although it's also sometimes that these cars

are expensive to repair and that sucks

and it feels so wasteful

in a way when you crash some of these cars.

But the sense that you're letting a team down.

Endurance racing is a team sport.

Not only do you have your mechanics,

do you usually have co-drivers.

So when I crash I just feel like,

damn it, I could have avoided this.

- Yeah, but also you could have died.

- Do you know what's funny?

I never think about that.

I don't think you can.

Because I think the moment you start thinking about

being able to die, you can't do it.

You can't go fast.

- Well, I'm sure not to go all Carl Jung and Freud here,

# Chapter 20

if you're in a real race and other people depend on you.

It's not even so much to car,

although it's also sometimes that these cars

are expensive to repair and that sucks

and it feels so wasteful

in a way when you crash some of these cars.

But the sense that you're letting a team down.

Endurance racing is a team sport.

Not only do you have your mechanics,

do you usually have co-drivers.

So when I crash I just feel like,

damn it, I could have avoided this.

- Yeah, but also you could have died.

- Do you know what's funny?

I never think about that.

I don't think you can.

Because I think the moment you start thinking about

being able to die, you can't do it.

You can't go fast.

- Well, I'm sure not to go all Carl Jung and Freud here,

but I'm sure that's always present

in the back of your mind somewhere.

You're not just bringing it to the surface.

- It is in the sense that it's part of the appeal,

it's part of the sense that there's something on the line

that this isn't just virtual.

I can't just hit reset, restart, reboot.

If I crash this car,

we're gonna be out or we're gonna be disadvantaged

or it's gonna get destroyed or I might get hurt.

I've gotten lightly hurt a few times.

I actually had the year we won

24 hours of Le Mans in our class,

I've been training in this formula 3.5 car.

It's a really fast car.

It's a really nice exercise to do,

but it's also, it doesn't have power steering.

So some of these race cars, especially the open-seaters,

they don't have power steering.

Which means that the steering wheel

is basically directly connected to the front wheels.

So if you crash one of those cars

and the front wheel suddenly turn,

you're really gonna hurt your hands

if you don't get your hands off the wheel.

I hadn't raced enough of those cars

to know that I had to get, or to have the instinct,

to have developed the instinct

that I had to get my hands off the wheel.

So I didn't, and I really hurt my hand

and this was just I think a month before the 24 of Le Mans.

So I thought, ah man, I'm gonna have to miss it this year.

I had like a, not a cast, it was just seriously sprained.

And then somehow miraculously

like a week before the event,

I was like, yeah, actually it's okay now.

So got to do it.

And that would've been grave regret

if I would've seen my team go on to win the race

and I would have to sit on the sidelines.

But I really have been quite fortunate

in the sense that most of my crashes

have just been expensive or sporting inconvenient.

They've never been something where I got seriously hurt.

But I've seen plenty of people

who have in fact, my co-driver this year

and for several years, Pietro Fittipaldi

drove a race car at Spa.

Spa is one of the great race tracks of all time.

And it has this iconic corner called Eau Rouge,

which is probably the most famous corner

in all of motorsports.

It has a great compression before you climb uphill.

It's extremely fast, very difficult corner.

And just as he does the compression,

his car basically sets out

and he loses his power steering

and he drives straight into the wall

and breaks both his legs

and basically faced the prospect

that maybe his career was over.

I've had other teammates

and people I know have serious injuries

that's really hurt them.

And yet what's funny, as you say,

you'd think that would sink in.

The year before we won in 2014,

that same car had a Danish driver in it at Le Mans

at the race I was driving who died.

He lost control of the car

when there was a bit of rain on the track

and the track went unfortunately designed

in such a poor way that there was a very big tree

right behind the railing.

And he hit that tree at full speed, pulled 90 Gs

and was dead on the spot,

which was just such an extremely

awful experience to go through.

I finished second that year,

which should have been caused for a bunch of celebration.

But it was just tainted by the fact that

not only did a driver die, a fellow Dane died.

A guy I knew died.

That was pretty tough.

- So that throw that into the pile of the things

that have to be considered is the weather conditions

that you mentioned of the track.

The weather is dry or wet.

- It's a huge part of it.

- Even just last year at Le Mans.

It was raining and I was out,

and I hadn't made a serious mistake

at the 24 hours of Le Mans

since I did the first race in 2012

where I put it in the sand trap

with like four hours to go

and we lost a couple of lap getting pulled out,

but it didn't actually change anything for our result

because that was just how the field was spread out.

I'd made minor mistakes over the years

but nothing that really set us out.

And at the race last year when it was raining,

I first clobbered a Ford Mustang

when I made an overambitious pass

on a damp part of the track and couldn't stop in time

and then felt absolutely awful

as I sat in the gravel pit for two laps

and knew that our race was over.

A race where we were highly competitive.

You're not blessed with a competitive car,

a competitive team and competitive setup every year.

I know how rare that is.

So to know that we had had a chance that year

and I sort of squandered it felt really bad,

but that got compounded.

I got back on track, barely made it another stint

and then put it in the gravel trap

again when it started raining on the entrance into Porsche.

So this is part of why racing is so addicting too

because the highs are very, very high.

When you win a race like the 24 hours of Le Mans.

It feels just incredible.

There's so much emotion.

But if you fuck it up, the lows are very, very low.

- What are the things you're paying attention to

when you're driving?

What are the parameters?

What are you loading in?

Are you feeling the grip?

Are you basically increasing the speed

and seeing what like a constant feedback system

effect that has on the grip

and you're trying to manage that

and try to find that optimal slip angle?

Are you looking around using your eyes?

Are you smelling things?

Are you listening just feeling the wind

or are you looking at the field too?

Like how'd you not hit that guy at all?

You get close with an inches, right?

So you have to pay attention to that too.

It's really interesting about that specific battle

where we're literally a few inches apart.

I can't fully explain it,

but humans can develop an incredible sense of space.

Where I can't see the edge of the back of my car,

but I can know exactly where it is.

I can have a mental model in my head

that gives me the exact dimensions of this car

just that I can run within a few inches

of a competitor car

or within a few inches of the wall

and not hit either when things go well.

The car is about two meters wide

and it's quite long, five meters.

And you can't see everything.

The mirrors are actually kind of shit.

There's no rear view mirror in these cars.

You can't see out the back.

You can only see through your two side mirrors.

But you formed this intuitive mental model

when you get good enough at this.

But what I actually pay attention to most

is I run a program.

What I try to do when I go to a racetrack

is I try to load up the best program I know how

for every single corner.

What's my break point?

What's my acceleration point?

What's my break trailing curve?

And I try to pick up that program in part

just by finding it myself and how fast I can go.

But even more so than that

by copying my professional competitors

or not competitors, co-drivers.

So I usually always race with a pro.

And modern race cars produce an absolute

enormous amount of data,

and you can analyze all that data after each outing.

You can see an exact trace

of how much you pushed the brake pedal,

how much you did in terms of steering inputs.

When you got on the gas,

you can see every millisecond you're losing

is evident in those charts.

So what I try to do is I try to look at the chart

and then I try to load that in

and like that's what I gotta do.

Oh, in this corner 17,

I have to be 10 bar lighter on the brake.

So I try to load that program in

and then I try to repeat it now.

Then there are all the things that changes.

Your tires change quite a lot.

These tires are made to only last

40 minutes in many cases.

Sometimes at Le Mans we can go longer,

but at some racetracks they'll last as little as 40 minutes

before they really fall off.

So you gotta manage that.

That the grip is constantly changing.

So your program have to suddenly fit

those changing circumstances.

And then in endurance racing,

you're constantly interacting with other cars

because you're passing slower classes

or you're getting passed by a faster class.

So that's part of the equation.

And then you're trying to dance the car

around the limit of adhesion.

So you got all those factors playing at the same time.

But above all else for me

is to try to become a robot.

Like how can I repeat this set of steps

exactly as I'm supposed to

for two and a half hours straight

without making 100 milliseconds worth of mistakes?

- Yeah, low latency algorithm.

- That's really a huge part of it actually.

Your latency is enormously important

in terms of being able to catch

when the car starts slipping.

You get this sensation in your body

that the G-force are a little off,

the slip angle is a little off,

and then you have to counter steer.

And obviously the best race car drivers

just feel like an intuition.

I have some intuition.

I don't have all of it,

so I do occasionally spin my car.

But that's the challenge.

- From everything you've studied and understand,

what does it take to achieve mastery in racing?

Like what does it take

to become the best race car driver in the world?

- Obsession is part of it.

When I read and hear about Senna and the other greats,

they were just singularly focused.

Max Verstappen is the current champion of the world

and he is the same kind.

Max has been fascinating to watch.

I mean he is a phenomenal race car driver,

but he also literally does nothing else.

When he is not at the racetrack,

he's driving sim racing.

Like he's literally in video games doing more racing

when he is not doing all the racing he's already doing.

- Is there a specific skill

that have that like stands out to you

as supernatural through all of that obsession?

Is it a bunch of factors or are they actually able to,

like you said, develop a sense?

Is it they're able to get to the very edge of the slip?

- They're able to develop very fine tuned sensibilities

for when the car's sliding.

They can feel just these tiny moments

or movements in the chassis

that transports up usually through their ass.

That's why you call us like a butt meter

that goes up and you feel like the car is loose

or you feel like you're just about to lock up.

You can really hone that tuning.

Then the other thing

is you have to have really good reaction time.

And when you look at great Formula 1 drivers,

they can generally have a reaction time

of just under 200 milliseconds, which is awesome.

And even 10 milliseconds difference makes a huge difference.

You'll see it when the Formula 1 grit, for example,

they do a standing start

and you see the five red lights come on.

And when the last light goes out,

they're supposed to release the clutch

and get going.

And they can time this.

So you can see exactly who has the reaction time.

And even being off by 20 milliseconds

can make the difference

of whether you're in front or behind at the first corner.

- How much of winning is also just the strategy

of jostling for a position?

- There's some of that

and some of it is also just nerve.

Who wants it more?

That's exactly when that sense of danger comes in.

There's a great quote from Fernando Alonso

when he was driving at Suzuka

against Schumacher, I think.

They're coming up to this incredibly fast corner.

It's very dangerous.

And Alonso basically accounts

I was gonna make the pass

'cause I knew he had a wife and kids at home.

- That's so gangster.

- Just absolutely ruthless, right?

- Yeah, wow. - That I knew he valued

life more than I did.

So there's a bit of poker sometimes in that.

Who's gonna yield?

There's a bit of chicken raised in that regard.

And sometimes it doesn't work.

No one yields and you both crash.

But very often one person will blink first.

- Can the pass be both on the inside and the outside?

- You can pass wherever you want

as long as you have just a slight part of the car

on the racetrack.

- And then you just improvise and take risks.

What a sport.

And then Senna, of course, is like a legendary risk taker.

- Yes, and even before him, by the time,

I mean he died in the '90s.

But by the time we got to the '90s,

racing was al already a lot safer

than it was when Niki Lauda raced in the '60s.

That level of danger is no longer there.

There's still just a remnant of it

and it is still dangerous, but nothing like that.

And it's a little hard to compare through the ages,

like who's the greatest driver of all time.

I think there's a fair argument that Senna is,

but we don't have the data.

We don't know who he was up against.

Like how would he fare if we pitted him

against Max Verstappen today.

I do think sometimes that you can have a bit of a nostalgia

for the all time greats, but the world moves forward

and new records are being set all the time

and the professionalism keeps improving.

Sometimes to the detriment of the sport, I think.

There's a lot of professional drivers

who are not only just very good at driving,

but are very good at being corporate spokespeople.

And it used to be quite different.

There used to be more characters in racing

that had a bit more personality

that they were allowed to shine

because there weren't a billion sponsorships

on the line that they were afraid to lose.

- Ridiculous question,

what's the greatest car I ever made,

or maybe what's the funnest one to drive?

- The greatest car for me of all time is the Pagani Zonda.

- [Lex] Okay, I'm looking this up, Pagani Zonda.

- [DHH] So the Pagani Zonda

was made by this wonderful Argentinian

called Horacio Pagani.

- [Lex] My god, that's a beautiful car, wow.

- It's a gorgeous car.

You can look up mine.

It's the Pagani Zonda HH.

So that's a car I had made in 2010

after we visited the factory in Modena.

And by sheer accident ended up with this car,

but it became my favorite car in the world basically.

When I watched an episode of "Top Gear,"

I think in 2005, where one of the presenters

was driving the Pagani Zonda F around.

And I just thought,

that's the most beautiful car in the world.

It is the most incredibly sounding car in the world.

If I one day have the option, this is what I want.

And then I had the option in 2010,

I've had the car ever since.

I'm never ever gonna sell it.

It's truly a masterpiece that stood the test of time.

There's some great cars from history

# Chapter 21

- [Lex] My god, that's a beautiful car, wow.

- It's a gorgeous car.

You can look up mine.

It's the Pagani Zonda HH.

So that's a car I had made in 2010

after we visited the factory in Modena.

I've had the car ever since.

I'm never ever gonna sell it.

It's truly a masterpiece that stood the test of time.

There's some great cars from history

that are recognized as being great in their time.

This car is still great.

- Have you taken on the racetrack?

- I have, it's terrible at that.

Well, I don't wanna say it's terrible that

that's not what it's designed for.

It's designed for the road and that's why it's great.

There are a lot of fast cars

that are straddling their race car for the road.

You don't actually want a race car for the world.

A race car for the world is a pain in the ass.

It's way too stiff.

It's way too loud.

It's way too uncomfortable.

You can't actually take it on a road trip.

- So this actually feels good driving

normal roads? - Totally, totally.

- And you of course always go to speed limit?

- Always.

This is why I love having this car in Spain

'cause they're a little more relaxed.

Not entirely relaxed, but more relaxed

than they are in a lot of places.

In Denmark, I kid you not, if you are on the highway

and you go more than twice the speed limit,

they confiscate your car and keep it.

You're not getting it back.

They don't even care if it's your car or not.

Like if you were boring my car

and you went twice the speed limit, it's gone.

So they don't do that in Spain.

I mean, in most places except for the German Autobahn,

they get pissy if you go twice the speed limit.

For all sorts of fair reasons, I'm not advocating

that you should be going much more than that.

But there are certain special roads

where you can't open things up and no one's in harm's way.

And that's an incredible sensation.

And I do think that some of those speed limits

actually are kind of silly.

And I'm not just saying that in a vacuum.

In Germany, they have the glorious Autobahn.

And on the Autobahn, there is no speed limit

in a bunch of segments.

And they're so committed to their speed-limitless Autobahn,

which is by the way, very weird of Germans.

They usually love rules.

They usually very precise about it.

And then they have this glorious thing called the Autobahn.

There was a great case a couple of years ago

where a guy took out a Bugatti Chiron;

went 400 kilometers an hour on the Autobahn

and he filled it and put it on YouTube

and a case was brought against him.

Because even though they don't have a speed limit,

they do have rules that you can't drive recklessly.

And he won the case.

He wasn't driving recklessly.

He was just going very, very fast.

I've done the Autobahn a couple of times.

My wife and I went on a road trip in Europe in 2009,

and I got the Lamborghini Gallardo.

We were driving up to 200 miles an hour.

And I'd driven 200 miles an hour

or close to it on a racetrack before.

That feels like one thing.

Driving on a public road, 200 miles an hour

feels really, really fast.

- Scary?

- Actually A little scary, yes.

Because you constantly think like on a racetrack,

you know the road, you know the surface.

You can walk the track most of the time.

You can know if there's a dip.

On a public road,

you can't know if there's suddenly a pothole.

Presumably there's not gonna be a pothole

on the German Autobahn.

but it does feel a little scary, but also exhilarating.

Speed is just intrinsically really fun.

I don't know anyone I've taken out in a fast car.

Well, actually I do know a few people.

Most people I take out in a fast car, they grin.

It's a human reaction to grin when you go really fast.

- Do you know what the fastest you've ever gone?

- I was probably at Le Mans,

I think when the LMP2s were at their maximum power

and had 600 horsepower and really sticky tires,

we were going 340 kilometers an hour,

which is just over 200 miles an hour.

A bit over 200 miles an hour.

That does feel fast.

And it's really interesting with speed

is that the difference between going, let's say 150

and 160 doesn't feel that much

actually those 10 mile an hour.

But the difference between going 190 and 200

feels crazy faster,

which as a percentage change is actually less

than going from 150 to 160.

But there's some sense of exponentiality

once you get up to those limits

where it's just on a complete different level.

- Yeah, 'cause to me like 110, 120 feels fast.

200? that's crazy. - It really is crazy.

- I gotta ask you about the details

of your programming setup, the IDE,

all that kind of stuff.

Let's paint the picture of the perfect programming setup.

Do you have a programming setup that you enjoy?

Are you very flexible?

Like how many monitors?

What kind of keyboard?

What kind of chair?

What kind of desk?

- It's funny because if you'd asked me,

let's see, a year and a half ago,

I would've given you the same answer

as I would've given anyone for basically 20 years.

I want a Mac.

I like the Magic Keyboard.

I like the single monitor.

Apple makes an awesome 6K 32-inch XDR screen

that I still haven't found anyone

who've beaten that I still use,

even though I switched away from Apple computers.

I still use their monitor because it's just fantastic.

But I've always been a single screen kind of guy.

I do like a big screen,

but I don't want multiple screens.

I've never found that that really works

with my perception.

I wanna be able to just focus on a single thing.

I don't want all of it all over the place.

And I've always used multiple virtual desktops

and being able to switch back and forth

between those things.

But the setup I have today is Linux.

I switched to a little over a year ago

after I finally got fed up with Apple enough

that I couldn't do that anymore.

And then I use this low profile mechanical keyboard

called the Lofree Flow84,

which is just the most glorious

sounding keyboard I've ever heard.

I know there are a lot of connoisseurs

of mechanical keyboards

that'll probably contest me on this.

This is too thy or too clicky or too clocky or whatever.

But for me, the Lofree Flow84

is just a delight that I did not even know existed.

Which is so funny because I mean,

I've been programming for a long time.

Mechanical keyboards have been a thing for a long time.

And the keyboard, when you look at it like this,

it just kind of, it looks plain,

it doesn't look extravagant.

But the tactile sensation

you get out of pushing those keys, the talky sound

that you hear when the keys hit the board.

It's just sublime.

And I'm kicking myself

that I was in this Mac bubble for so long

that I wasn't even in the market to find this.

I knew mechanical keyboards existed,

but to be blunt, I thought it was a bit of a nerd thing

that only real nerds that were much more nerdy

than me would ever care about.

And then I got out of the Apple bubble

and suddenly I had to find everything again.

I had to find a new mouse,

I had to find a new keyboard,

I had to find everything.

And I thought like, all right,

let me give mechanical keyboards a try.

And I gave quite a few of them a try.

The Keychron is one of the big brands

in that I didn't like that at all.

I tried a bunch of other keyboards

and then I finally found this keyboard

and I just went like, angels are singing.

Where have you been my whole life?

We spent as programmers so much of our time

interacting with those keys.

It really kind of matters

in a way I didn't fully appreciate.

I used to defend the Apple Magic Keyboard,

like hey, it's great.

It's actually a great keyboard.

And I think for what it is, this ultra-low profile,

ultra low travel is actually a really nice keyboard.

But once you've tried a longer travel

mechanical keyboard, there's no going back.

- You do have to remember in many ways,

both on the software side and the hardware side,

that you do spend a lot of hour behind the computer.

It's worth... - It's worth investing in.

- And also worth exploring

until you find the thing

where the angels starts singing, whatever.

- That's exactly right.

And I actually do regret that a little bit,

especially with this damn keyboard.

I mean, I could have been listening

to these beautiful thocky keys for years and years,

but sometimes you have to get really off

before you open your eyes

and see that something else exists.

I feel the same way about Linux.

So I've been using Linux on the server

since late '90s, probably.

We ran servers on Linux back then.

I never seriously considered it as a desktop option.

I never ran Linux before, directly myself.

I always thought, you know what?

I wanna focus on programming.

I don't have time for all these configuration files

and all this setup bullshit and whatnot.

And Apple is close enough.

It's built on Unix underpinnings.

Why do I need to bother with Linux?

And again, it was one of those things.

I needed to try new things and try something else

to realize that there is other things other than Apple.

And again, it's not 'cause I hate Apple.

I think they still make good computers.

I think a lot of the software

is still also pretty okay.

But I have come to realize that as a web developer,

Linux is just better.

Linux is just better.

It's closer to what I deploy on.

The tooling is actually phenomenal.

And if you spend a bit of time setting it up,

you can record a reproducible environment

that I've now done with this Omakub concept

or project that I've done,

that I can set up a new Linux machine

in less than 30 minutes.

And it's perfect.

It's not pretty good.

It's not like I still need to spend two hours on.

It's perfect because you can code all aspects

of the development environment into this.

And I didn't know.

I didn't even know, to be fair,

that Linux could look as good as it can.

If you look at a stock Ubuntu or Fedora boot,

I mean, not that it's ugly,

but I'd pick the Mac any day of the week.

You look at Omakub,

I mean, I'm biased here, of course,

'cause I built it with my own sensibilities.

But I look at that and go like, this is better.

This is beautiful.

And then you look at some of those true

Linux rising setups where people go nuts with everything

and you go, oh yeah, I remember when computers

used to be fun in this way,

when there was this individuality and this setup.

And it wasn't just all planned the sameness.

And I think that's the flip side

sometimes of something like Apple,

where they have really strong opinions

and they have really good opinions,

they have very good taste.

And it looks very nice

and it also looks totally the same.

And Linux has far more variety

and far more texture and flavor.

Sometimes also annoyances and bugs and whatever.

But I run Linux now.

It's Ubuntu-based with the Omakub stuff on top.

The low free keyboard.

I use a Logitech, what's it called?

The MX 3 mouse, which I love how it feels in my hand.

I don't love how it looks.

I actually was a Magic Mouse stan for the longest time.

I thought it was genius

that Apple integrated the track pad into a mouse,

and I used that.

And I always thought it was ridiculous

that people would slag it

just because you had to charge it by flipping it over.

'Cause the battery would last for three months

and then you'd charge it for half an hour.

I thought like, that's a perfect

compatibility with my sensibilities.

I don't mind giving up a little inconvenience

if something is beautiful,

and that Magic Mouse is beautiful.

But it wasn't gonna work on Linux.

So I found something else.

The S3 is nice,

but I sometimes do wish like the Magic Mouse.

That's pretty good.

- Yeah, Linux is really great

for customizing everything, for tiling,

for macros, for all of that.

And I also do the same in Windows with AutoHotKey

or just customize the whole thing

to your preferences.

- If you're a developer,

you should learn how to control your environment

with the keyboard.

It's faster, it's more fluid.

I think one of those silly things

I've come to truly appreciate about my Omakub setup

is that I can, in whatever time

it takes to refresh the screen,

probably five milliseconds

switch from one virtual desktop to another.

Even on Windows, you can't get it that smooth.

You can get close,

you can't get it that smooth.

On macOS, for whatever reason,

Apple insists on having this infuriating animation

when you switch between virtual desktops,

which makes it just that you don't want to.

You don't wanna run full screen apps

because it's too cumbersome to switch

between the virtual desktops.

The kind of immediacy that you can get

from a wonderful Linux setup in that regard,

it's just next level.

- Yeah, and it seems like a subtle thing,

but you know, difference in milliseconds and latency

between switching the virtual desktops, for example.

I don't know, it changes...

- It changes how you use the computer.

It really does.

- Similar thing with VR, right?

If there's some kind of latency

or like it just completely takes you all out of it.

- And it's funny, I actually had to watch,

I think it was ThePrimeagen on YouTube

when he was showing off his setup

and I was seeing how quickly

he was switching between those virtual desktops.

And I'd always been using virtual desktops,

but I didn't like switching too much

because just of that latency

and it's like, oh, you can do that on Linux?

Oh, that's pretty cool.

So I run that, and then my editor

of choice now is Neovim.

- Oh good, all right.

Well we're out of time.

No, all right, you did for many, many years.

You used, what is it? TextMate.

- Yes, TextMate. - TextMate, yeah.

- That was actually, that was the main blocker

of moving away from Apple.

Everything else I thought, do you know what?

I can swing it.

But TextMate was and is a wonderful editor.

One, I helped birth into this world.

The programmer Allan Odgaard is a good friend of mine,

all the way back from the party days

when we were lugging our computers around.

And he was a big Mac guy.

And in 2005, he was writing this editor

and I helped him with the project management

of kind of keeping him on track,

keeping him focused on getting something released.

Because I really wanted it for myself.

And I thought, this was the last editor

I thought I was never gonna switch.

- Forgive me for not knowing,

but how featureful as this editor is this?

- It's quite featureful,

but it's a GUI-driven editor in some regards.

It was really early on with ways of recording macros

and having sort of sophisticated syntax highlighting.

And it did a bunch of firsts

and it was just a really pleasant editing experience.

I think these days a lot of people

would just use VS Code.

VS Codes exist in the same universe as TextMate

in some ways.

And actually I think is compatible

with the original TextMate bundles,

the original TextMate format.

So it really trailed a path there,

but it also just didn't evolve.

Now a lot of people saw a huge problem with that.

They were like, "Oh, it needs to have more features.

It needs to have all these things."

I was like, I'm happy with this text editor.

That hasn't changed at all.

Basically when Allan stopped working on it

for a decade or more.

I don't need anything else.

Because as our original discussion went,

I don't want an IDE.

I don't want the editor to write code for me.

I want to text editor.

I want interact with characters directly.

And Neovim allows me to do that in some ways

# Chapter 22

in some ways.

And actually I think is compatible

with the original TextMate bundles,

the original TextMate format.

So it really trailed a path there,

but it also just didn't evolve.

Now a lot of people saw a huge problem with that.

They were like, "Oh, it needs to have more features.

It needs to have all these things."

I was like, I'm happy with this text editor.

I don't want an IDE.

I don't want the editor to write code for me.

I want to text editor.

I want interact with characters directly.

And Neovim allows me to do that in some ways

that are even better than TextMate.

And I love TextMate, but Vi as you know.

Once you learn the commands and it sounds,

I sometimes feel like Vi fans overplay

how difficult it is to learn

because it makes them perhaps seem kind of more awesome

that they were able to do it.

It's not that difficult.

And it doesn't take that long, in my opinion,

to learn just enough combo moves

to get that high of holy shit,

I could not do this in any other editor.

- How long did it take you?

And by the way, I don't know, I haven't yet.

Oh, I know, intellectually.

But just like with kids,

I haven't gone in all the way in.

I haven't used Vim.

- You have a treat in mind.

Well, I switched in about,

I had three days when I switched here about a year ago.

I had three days of cursing

where I thought it was absolutely terrible

and it was never gonna happen.

And I had three days of annoyance

and already the next week I was like, this is sweet.

I'm not going anywhere.

But I also had a bit of a head start about

20 years ago in early 2000s.

I tried Vim for like a summer and it didn't stick.

I didn't for whatever reason love it at the time.

But Neovim is really good.

The key to Neovim is to realize

that you don't have to build the whole editor yourself.

There's a lot of Neovim stans are like,

here's how to write the conflict from scratch.

Over 17 episodes, that's gonna take you three weeks.

Ah, I don't care that much.

I love a great editor.

I love to tailor it a little bit, but not that much.

So you have to pair Neovim with this thing called LazyVim.

Lazyvim.org is a distribution for Neovim

that takes all the drudgery

out of getting an amazing editor

experience right out of the box.

- Ridiculous question, we talked about

a bunch of programming languages.

You told us how much you love JavaScript.

It's your second favorite programming language.

Would TypeScript be the third then?

- TypeScript wouldn't even be in this universe.

I hate TypeScript as much as I like JavaScript.

- So what you hate, oh man,

I'm not smart enough to understand the math of that.

Okay, before I ask about other programming languages,

if you can encapsulate your hatred of TypeScript

into something that could be human interpretable,

what would be the reasoning?

- The JavaScript smells a lot like Ruby

when it comes to some aspects of its metaprogramming.

And TypeScript just complicates that

to an infuriating degree

when you're trying to write that kind of code.

And even when you're trying to write

the normal kind of code,

none of the benefits that accrue to people who like it.

Like auto completion is something I care about.

I don't care about auto completion

because I'm not using an IDE.

Now I understand that that is part

of what separates it and why.

I don't see the benefits.

I only see the costs.

I see the extra typing.

I see the type gymnastics that you sometimes have to do

and where a bunch of people give up

and just do any instead, right?

Like that they don't actually use the type system

because it's just too frustrating to use.

So I've ever only felt the frustration of TypeScript

and the obfuscation of TypeScript in the code

that gave me no payoff.

Again, I understand that there is a payoff.

I don't want the payoff.

So for my situation,

I'm not willing to make the trade

and I'm not willing to take a language that underneath

is as dynamic of a language as rubious

and then turn it into this pretend

statically type language.

I find that just intellectually insulting.

- Do you think it will

and do you think it should die TypeScript?

- I don't wanna take something away

from people who enjoy it.

So if you like TypeScript, all the most part of you.

If you using TypeScript because you think

that's what a professional program is supposed to do,

here's my permission,

you don't have to use TypeScript.

- There's something deeply enjoyable about

a brilliant programmer such as yourself,

DHH is talking shit.

It's like one of my favorite things in life.

What are the top three programming languages

everyone should learn

if you're talking to a beginner?

- I would 100% start with Ruby.

It is magic for beginners

in terms of just understanding the core concepts

of conditionals and loops and whatever,

because it makes it so easy.

Even if you're just making a shell program

that's outputting to the terminal,

getting hello-world running in Ruby

is basically puts, P-U-T-S, space, start quotes,

hello world, end quotes, you're done, right?

There's no fluff.

There's nothing to wrap it into.

There are other languages that does that,

especially in the Perl or Python

would be rather similar.

But Go would not, Java would not.

There's a lot of other languages

that have a lot more ceremony and boilerplate.

Ruby has none of it.

So it's a wonderful starting language.

There's a book called "Learn to Program"

by Pine that uses Ruby

essentially to just teach basic programming principles

that I've seen heavily recommended.

So that's a great language.

- [Lex] How quickly would you go to Rails?

- It depends on what you wanna do.

If you wanna build web applications,

go to Rails right away.

Learn Ruby along with Rails,

because I think what really helps

power through learning programming

is to build programs that you want, right?

If you're just learning it in the abstract,

it's difficult to motivate yourself to actually do it.

Well, some people learn languages

just for the fun of them.

Most people do not.

Most people learn it

because they have a mission.

They wanna build a program.

They wanna become a programmer.

So you gotta use it for something real.

And I actually find that it's easier to learn programming

that way too because it drives your learning process.

You can't just learn the whole thing up front.

You can't just sit down

and read the language specification,

then go like, ooh, like Neo.

Now I know kung fu.

Now I know Ruby.

It doesn't download that way.

You actually have to type it out in anger

on a real program.

- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

- So I would start there.

But then number two, I probably would be JavaScript.

Because JavaScript just is the language

you need to know if you wanna work with the web.

And the web is the greatest application

platform of all time

if you're making business software,

collaboration software, all this kind of stuff.

If you're making video games,

you should probably go off and learn C++ or C

or something else like that.

But if you're in the realm of web applications,

you gotta learn JavaScript.

Regardless of what else you learn,

you gotta learn JavaScript.

- So if you're learning Ruby,

what does Ruby not have in terms of programming concepts

that you would need other languages for?

- I dunno if there's any concepts missing,

but it doesn't have the speed or the low level access

of memory manipulation that you would need to build

a 3D gaming engine, for example.

No one's gonna build that in Ruby.

You could build quite low level stuff

when it comes to web technologies in Ruby.

But at some point, you're gonna hit the limit

and you should use something else.

I'm not someone who prescribed just Ruby for everything.

Just once you reach the level of abstraction

that's involved with web applications, Ruby is superb.

But if you're writing, for example, HTTP proxy,

go, it's great for that.

We've written quite a few HTTP proxies

lately at the company for various reasons,

including our cloud exit and so forth.

And Kevin, one of the programs I'm working with,

he writes all of that in Go.

Go just have the primitives

and it has the pace and the speed

to do that really well.

I highly recommend it.

If you're writing an HTTP general proxy, do it in Go.

Great language for that.

Don't ride your business logic in Go.

I know people do, but I don't see the point in that.

- So what would you say the three,

so Go, Ruby plus Rails, JavaScript?

- Yeah, if you're interested in working with the web,

I'd pick those three.

Go, Ruby and JavaScript.

- Go, Ruby and JavaScript, okay.

Functional languages?

- Someone's talking about Ocaml.

- They are always going to show up.

It must be some kind of OCaml industrial complex

or something like this.

But they always say mention OCaml.

- I love that there are people

who love functional languages to that degree.

Those people are not me.

I don't care at all.

Like I care about functional principles

when they help me in these isolated cases

where that's just better than everything else.

But at heart, I'm an object oriented guy.

That's just how I think about programs.

That's how I like to think about programs.

That's how I carve up a big problem space

into a domain language.

Objects are my jam.

- Yeah, me too.

So I program a Lisp a bunch

for like AI applications for basic.

So Othello, chess engines, that kind of stuff.

And I did try OCaml just to force myself

to program just a very basic game of life.

A little simulation.

It's much, you know,

Lisp is just parentheses everywhere.

It's actually not readable at all.

- That's the problem I've had with Lisp.

- OCaml is very intuitive, very readable.

It's nice.

- I really should pick up a language

like that at some point.

I've been programming long enough

that it's a little embarrassing

that I haven't actually done anything real in anger

in a fully functionally programming language.

- Yeah, but like I have to figure out,

I'm sure there's an answer to this.

What can I do that would be useful for me

like that I actually wanna build?

- Yes, yes, that's my problem

- That a functional language is better suited for.

- That's right. - Because I really

wanna experience the language properly.

- [DHH] That's right.

- Yeah, 'cause I'm still, yeah.

At this point, I'm very object-oriented brained.

- Yes, and that's my problem too.

I don't care as much about these low level problems

in computer science.

I care about the high level.

I care about writing software.

I care about the abstraction layer

that really floats well

with web applications and business logic.

And I've come to accept that about myself.

Even though, as we talked about when I was a kid,

I really wanted to become a games programmer.

And then I saw what it took

to write a collision detection engine.

And I go like, yeah, that's not me at all.

I'm never gonna be into vector matrix manipulation

or any of that stuff.

It's way too much math

and I'm more of a writing person

than I'm of a math person.

- I mean, just in the way you were speaking today,

you have like a poetic literary approach to programming.

- Yes. - Yeah.

- It's interesting, that's actually exactly right.

So I did actually a keynote at RailsConf 10 years ago

where I call myself a software writer.

I mean, I'm not the first person to say that software writer

has been in the vernacular for a long time.

But the modern identity that most programmers adopt

when they're trying to be serious is software engineer.

And I reject that label.

I'm not an engineer.

Occasionally I dabble in some engineering,

but the vast majority of the time, I'm a software writer.

I write software for human consumption

and for my own delight.

I can get away with that

because I'm working in a high level language like Ruby,

working on collaboration software

and to-do lists and all the other stuff.

Again, if I was trying to apply my talents

to writing 3D game engines,

no, that's not the right mindset.

That's not the right identity.

But I find that the software engineering identity

flattens thing a little bit,

I'd like to think that we have software writers

and software mathematicians, for example.

And then those are actually richer

ways of describing the abstraction level

that you're working at than engineer.

- Yeah, and I think if AI

becomes more and more successful,

I think we'll need software writer skill more and more.

Because it feels like that's the realm

of which, 'cause it's not writer.

You're gonna have to do the software.

You're gonna have to be a computer person.

But there's a more... I don't know,

I just don't wanna romanticize it,

but it's more poetic, it's more literary.

It's more feels like writing a good blog post than...

- I actually wish that AI

had a bit higher standards for writing.

I find the fact that it accepts my sloppy,

incomplete sentences a little offensive.

I wish there was like a strict mode for AI

where it would snap my fingers.

It was just feeding it key words

and like speak proper,

do pronunciation, do punctuation,

because I love that.

I love crafting a just right sentence

that hasn't been boiled down,

that it has no meat on, it has no character in it.

It's succinct.

It's not overly flowery.

It is just right that writing phase,

to me, is just addictive.

And I find that when programming is the best,

it's almost equivalent exactly to that.

You also have to solve a problem.

You're not just communicating a solution.

You have to actually figure out

what are you trying to say, but even writing has that.

Half the time when I start writing a blog post,

I don't know exactly what arguments I'm gonna use.

They develop as part of the writing process.

And that's how writing software happens too.

You know roughly the kind of problem

you're trying to solve.

You don't know exactly how you're gonna solve it.

And as you start typing, the solution emerges.

- And actually, as far as I understand,

you and Jason are working on a new book.

It's in the early days of that kind of topic.

I think he said,

he tweeted that it's gonna be titled something like,

we don't know what we're doing upfront, something like that.

That kind of topic.

And you figure out along the way.

- That's a big part of it.

Trying to give more people the permission

to trust your own instincts and their own gut

and realizing that developing

that supercomputer in your stomach

is actually the work of a career.

And that you should not discard those feelings

in preference to over comp...

or not even complicated,

to analytics, to intellectualism.

Very often when we look at the big decisions

we've had to make, they've come from the gut

where you cannot fully articulate like,

why do I think this is the right thing?

Well, because I've been in this business for 20 years

and I've seen a bunch of things

and I've talked to a bunch of people,

and that is percolating into this being the right answer.

A lot of people are very skeptical about that

in business or unable to trust it

because it feels like they can't rationalize.

Why are we doing something?

Well, because I feel like it, damn it.

That's a great privilege

of being a bootstrapped independent founder

who don't owe their business to someone else

and doesn't have to produce a return.

Because I feel like a lot of the really creeps in

# Chapter 23

or not even complicated,

to analytics, to intellectualism.

Very often when we look at the big decisions

we've had to make, they've come from the gut

where you cannot fully articulate like,

why do I think this is the right thing?

Well, because I've been in this business for 20 years

and I've seen a bunch of things

and I've talked to a bunch of people,

A lot of people are very skeptical about that

Well, because I feel like it, damn it.

That's a great privilege

of being a bootstrapped independent founder

who don't owe their business to someone else

and doesn't have to produce a return.

Because I feel like a lot of the really creeps in

when you're trying to rationalize to other people

why you do the things you do

and why you take the decisions that you do.

If you don't have anyone to answer to,

you are free to follow your gut.

And that's hell of enjoyable way to work.

And it's also in very often the correct way to work.

Your gut knows a lot, like you can't articulate it,

but it's spot on more times than not.

- Yeah, having to make a plan can be a paralyzing thing.

I've often, I mean,

I suppose there's different kinds of brains.

And first of all,

I can't wait to read that book if it materializes.

I often feel like in the more interesting things

I do in my life,

I really don't know what I'm doing up upfront.

And I think there's a lot of people around me

that care for me that really want me

to know what I'm doing.

They're like, what's the plan?

Why are you doing this crazy thing?

And if I had to wait until I have a plan,

I'm not gonna do it.

They have different brains on this kind of stuff.

Some people really are planners

and it maybe energizes them.

I think most creative pursuits, most really interesting,

most novel pursuits are like,

you kind of have to just take the leap

and then just figure out as you go.

- My favorite essay in "Rework" is the last one,

and it's entitled, Inspiration is Perishable.

And I think that captures a lot of it,

that if you take the time to do a detailed plan,

you may very well have lost the inspiration

by the time you're done.

If you follow the inspiration in that moment

and trust your gut, trust your own competence,

that you will figure it out,

you're gonna get so much more back.

You're gonna go on the adventure

you otherwise wouldn't have.

Whether that's just a business decisions or life decision,

you have to seize that inspiration.

There's a great set of children's books

written by this Japanese author about chasing an idea

and trying to get a hold of it,

and it's beautifully illustrated as an idea

something that's floating around

as something you have to catch and latch onto.

That I really feel captures this notion

that inspiration is perishable, it'll disappear.

If you just put it back on the shelf and say like,

well, I gotta be diligent about this.

I gotta line up a plan.

You may run out and then there's no steam to keep going.

- I have to ask about open source.

What does it take to run a successful open source project?

You've spoken about that.

It's a misconception that open source is democratic.

It's actually meritocratic.

That's a beautiful way to put it.

So there's often is a kind of also a benevolent

dictator at the top often.

So can you just speak to that?

Having run successful open source projects yourself

and being a benevolent dictator yourself.

- Which is gonna be a bit of a biased

piece of evidence here, but I...

- But why monarchy is best. - It's great.

We should definitely have dictators

and they should control everything,

especially when the dictator is me.

Now, well I think I learned very early on

that a quick way to burn out in open source

is to treat it as a business,

as though your users are customers,

as though they have claims of legitimacy on your time

and your attention and your direction.

Because I faced this almost immediately

with Ruby on Rails.

As soon as it was released,

there were a million peoples

who had all sorts of opinions about

where I ought to take it.

And not just opinions, but actually demands.

Unless you implement an Oracle database adaptive,

this is always gonna be a toy.

It was actually more or less that exact demand

that prompted me to have a slide at one

of the early Rails conferences that just said, fuck you.

- [Lex] Yeah, I saw that.

- I'm not gonna do what you tell me to.

I'm here as a bringer of gift.

I am sharing code that I wrote on my own time,

on my own volition.

And you don't have to say thank you.

I mean it'd be nice if you did.

You can take the code and do whatever you want with it.

You can contribute back if you want,

but you can't tell me what to do

or where to go or how to act.

I'm not a vendor.

This is a fundamental misconception

that users of open source occasionally step into,

because they're used to buying software from companies

who really care about their business.

I care about people using my software.

I think it's great,

but we don't have a transactional relationship.

I don't get something back

when you tell me what to do except grief.

And I don't want it, so you can keep it.

So my open source philosophy

from the start has been, I gotta do this primarily for me.

I love when other people find use in my open source.

It's not my primary motivation.

I'm not primarily doing it for other people.

I'm primarily doing it for me and my own objectives

because as Adam Smith said,

it's not for the benevolence of the butcher

that we expect our daily meat.

It's for his self-interest.

And I actually find that to be a beautiful thought

that our comments increase in value

when we all pursue our self-interest.

Certainly in the realm of open source.

This is also why I reject this notion

that open source is in some sort of crisis.

That there's a funding crisis that we have to spend more.

No, we don't.

Open source has never been doing better.

Open source has never controlled more domains

in software than it has right now.

There is no crisis.

There's a misconception from some people making open source

and from a lot of people using open source.

That open source is primarily like commercial software.

Something you buy

and something where you can then make demands as a customer.

And that the customer is always right.

Customer is not always right.

Not even in business, but certainly not in open source.

In open source,

the customer, as it is, is a receiver of gifts.

We are having a gift exchange.

I show up and give you my code.

If you like it, you can use it.

And if you have some code that fits in

with where I'm going with this,

I would love to get those gifts back.

And we can keep trading like that.

I give you more gifts.

You give me some of your gifts.

Together, we pool all the gifts

such that someone showing up brand new,

just get a mountain of gifts.

This is the magic thing of open source

is it increases the total sum value

of what's in the common

when we all pursue our own self-interest.

So I'm building things for Rails that I need.

And you know what?

You want me to do that.

You do not want me to build things

that I don't need on behalf of other people,

'cause I'll do a crap job.

I build much better software

when I can evaluate the quality of that software

by my own use.

I need this feature.

I'm gonna build a good version of that feature

and I'm gonna build just enough just for me.

So I'm not gonna bloat it.

I'm not trying to attract the customer here.

I'm not trying to see some angle.

I'm just building what I need.

And if you go into open source with that mentality

that you're building for you and everything else is a bonus,

I think you have all the ingredients to go to distance.

I think the people who burn out in open source

is when they go in thinking, "I'm making all these gifts.

I don't really need them myself,

but I'm like hoping someone else does

and maybe they'll also give me some money."

That's a losing proposition.

It never basically works.

If you want money for your software,

you should just sell it.

We have a perfectly fine model of commercial software

that people can make that kind

and then they can sell it.

But I find a lot of confusion,

let's just call it that politely,

in open source contributors

who want to have their cake and eat it too.

They like the mode of working with open source.

They maybe even like the status that comes from open source,

but they also would like to earn a living

for making that open source.

And therefore, they occasionally end up

with the kind of grievances

that someone who feels underappreciated at work will develop

when others aren't doing enough to recognize

their great gifts.

- And then they might walk away.

I wish I had more insight into their mind state

of the individual people that are running these projects,

like if they're feeling sad or they need more money

or they're like, it's just such a dark box.

- It can be.

- I mean of course there's some communication,

but I just sadly see too often

they just kind of walk away.

- Right, and I think that's actually

also part of the beauty of open source.

- Is walking away. - You are not obligated

to do this code forever.

You're obligated to do this for as long as you wanna do it.

That's basically your own obligation.

- But there is a, I know, okay...

So you might criticize some pushback.

You did write a blog post on forever,

until the end of the internet with ta-da list.

There is a beautiful aspect

and you found a good balance there.

But I don't know, you're bringing so much joy to people

with this thing you created.

It's not an obligation, but there's a real beauty

to taking care of this thing you've created.

There is and not forgetting.

I think, what I think

what the open source creator is not seeing enough

and I mean there's like,

how many lives you're making better.

There's certain pieces of software

that I just quietly use a lot.

And like they bring my life joy

and I wish I could communicate that well.

There's ways to donate, but it's inefficient.

It's usually hard to donate.

- It is.

There's some ways for some people that made it easier.

GitHub donations is one way of doing it.

I donate to a few people

even though I don't love the paradigm.

I also accept that we can have multiple paradigms.

I accept that I can do open source

for one set of motivations

and other people can do

open source for other motivations.

We don't all have to do it the same way.

But I do want to counter the misconception

that open source is somehow high in a crisis

unless we all start paying for open source.

That model already exists.

It's commercial software.

It works very well and plenty of great companies

have been built off the back of it.

And the expectations are very clear.

I pay you this amount and I get this software.

Open source, once you start mixing money into it,

gets real muddy real fast.

And a lot of it's just from those misaligned expectations.

That if you feel like you're starving artists

as an open source developer

and you are owed X amount of money

because your software is popular, you're delusional

and you need to knock that off.

Just get back on track

where you realize that you're putting gifts into the world.

And if you get something back

in terms of monetary compensation,

okay, that's a bonus.

But if you need that money back

in terms of monetary compensation,

you just charge for software

or go work for a software company

that will employ you to do open source.

There's tons of that.

That is probably actually the primary mode

that open source software

is being developed in the world today.

Commercial companies making open source

that they need themselves and then contributing it back.

- So I'm glad you sort of like

drew some hard lines here.

It is a good moment to bring up

what I think is the, maybe one of the greatest

open source projects ever, WordPress.

And you spoke up in October 24

about some of the stuff that's been going on

with WordPress's founder Matt Mullenweg

in a blog post open source royalty and mad kings.

It's a really good blog post

on sort of just the idea of Benevolent Dictators For Life,

this model for open source projects.

And then the basic implication

was that Matt as the BDFL of WordPress

has lost his way a bit with his battle with WP Engine.

So I should also say that I really love WordPress.

It brings me joy.

I think it's a really...

it's a beacon of what open source could be.

I think it's made the internet better.

It allowed a lot of people to create wonderful websites.

And I also think, now you might disagree with this,

but from everything I've seen,

WP Engine just gives me bad vibes.

I think they're not the good guy in this.

I don't like it.

I understand the frustration.

I understand all of it,

but I don't think that excuses the behavior.

There is a bit of, see this kind of counter

to a little bit what you said,

which is when you have a open source project of that size,

there is a bit of a, like when you're the king

for a project of a kingdom that large,

there's a bit of responsibility.

Anyway, could you speak to your, maybe to your empathy

of Matt and to your criticism

and maybe paint a path

of how he and WordPress can be winning again?

- First echo what you said about

what a wonderful thing it is that WordPress exists.

That there are not many projects

in the open source world or in the world at large

that has had as big of an impact on the internet

as WordPress has.

He deserves a ton of accolades for that work.

So that was my engagement, essentially my premise.

Do you know what?

I had tremendous respect

for what Matt has built with WordPress.

What that entire ecosystem has built around itself.

It's a true marvel.

But there's some principles

that are larger than my personal sympathies

to the characters involved.

I agree.

The Silver Lake private equity company

that's involved with WP Engine is not my natural ally.

I'm not the natural ally of private equity

doing some game with VP Engine.

That's not my interest in the case.

My interest is essentially a set of principles.

And the principles are if you release

something as open source,

people are free to use it as they see fit.

And they're free to donate code or resources

or money back to the community as they see fit.

You may disagree about whether they've done enough,

whether they should do more, but you can't show up

after you've given the gift

of free software to the world

and then say, now that you've used that gift,

you actually owe me a huge slide of your business

because you got too successful

# Chapter 24

to the characters involved.

I agree.

The Silver Lake private equity company

that's involved with WP Engine is not my natural ally.

I'm not the natural ally of private equity

doing some game with VP Engine.

That's not my interest in the case.

My interest is essentially a set of principles.

And the principles are if you release

You may disagree about whether they've done enough,

whether they should do more, but you can't show up

after you've given the gift

of free software to the world

and then say, now that you've used that gift,

you actually owe me a huge slide of your business

because you got too successful

using the thing I gave you for free.

You don't get to take a gift back.

That's why we have open source licenses.

They stipulate exactly what the obligations are

on both sides of the equation.

The uses of open source don't get to demand

what the makers of open source do and how they act.

And the makers of open source

don't get to suddenly show up with a ransom note

to the users and say,

actually you owe me for all sorts of use.

I'm 100% allergic to that kind of interaction.

And I think Matt, unfortunately, for whatever reason,

got so wrapped up in what he was owed

that he failed to realize what he was destroying.

WordPress and Automatic already makes a ton of money.

This is part of the wonder of WordPress.

This is a project

that generates hundreds of millions of dollars,

and Matt didn't feel like he was getting enough of that.

That's not a good argument, bro.

You can't just violate the spirit

and the letter of these open source licensees

and just start showing up with demand letters

even to characters that are not particularly sympathetic.

This goes to the root of my interpretation

of open source in general.

The GPL is a particular license

that actually demands code

from people who use it under certain circumstances.

I've never liked the GPL.

I don't want your shitty code

if you don't wanna give it to me.

What am I gonna do with that?

Some code dump that youve...

I'm not on board with that part of Stallman's vision at all.

I love the MIT license.

To me that is the perfect license

because it is mercifully short.

I think it's two paragraphs, three paragraphs.

Really short, and it basically says, here's some software.

It comes with no warranty.

You can't sue me.

You can't demand anything,

but you can do whatever the hell you want with it.

Have a nice life.

That's a perfect open source interaction in my opinion.

And that license needs to be upheld.

These licenses, in general, even the GPL,

even if I don't like it,

we have to abide by them.

Because if we just set aside those licensees,

when we in a moment's notice

feel like something's slightly unfair,

we've lost everything.

We've lost the entire framework

that allowed open source to prosper

and allowed open source

to become such an integral part of commerce too.

I mean, back when open source was initially

finding its feet,

it was at war with commercial software.

Stallman is at war with commercial software

and always has been.

Bill Gates was in return at war

with open source for the longest time.

The open source licensees

and the clarity that they provide

allowed us to end that war.

Today, commercial software and open source software

can peacefully coexist.

I make commercial software.

I sell Basecamp, I sell HEY,

and then I also make a bunch of open source software

that I give away for free as gifts.

That can't happen

if we start violating these contracts.

No commercial company is gonna go,

"Let me base my next project

off this piece of open source.

If I'm also running the liability

that some mad maker is gonna show up seven years in

and demand, I give them $50 million."

That's not an environment conducive

to commerce collaboration or anything else.

And it's just basically wrong.

I think there's one analysis that's all about

kind of the practical outcomes of this,

which I think are bad.

There's also some an argument that's simply about ethics.

This is not right.

You can't just show up afterwards and demand something.

This is not too dissimilar in my opinion,

to the whole Apple thing we talked about earlier.

Apple just showing up and feeling like they're entitled

to 30% of everyone's business.

No, that's not right.

That's not fair.

So I think Matt unfortunately

kind of steered himself blind

on the indignity

he thought was being perpetrated

against him because there was all this money being made

by VP Engine making a good product

and not giving quite enough back in Matt's opinion,

tough cookie.

- I think there, maybe I'm reading too much into it,

but there might be some personal stuff too,

which they weren't only not giving enough,

but probably implicitly promising that they will give

and then taking advantage of him in that way in his mind,

just like interpersonal interaction.

And then you get like interpersonally frustrated,

that forget like the bigger picture ethics of it.

It's like when a guy keeps saying, you know,

promising you'll do something.

And then you realize you wake up one day

like a year or two later.

Wait a minute, I was being lied to this whole time

and that I don't even know if it's about money.

- I'd get mad too.

It's totally fine to get mad when people disappoint you.

That's not justification for upending decades

of open source licensees

and the essential de facto case law

we've established around it.

This is why I chose to even weigh in on this

because I like WordPress.

I don't use WordPress.

I'm not a part of that community.

I don't actually have a dog in this fight.

I'm biased if anything towards Matt just as a fellow BDFL.

I would like to see him do well with this.

But I also think there's some principles at stake here

that ring much louder.

I don't want Rails to suddenly be tainted

by the fact that it's open source

and whether companies can rely on it

and build businesses on it.

Because wait, maybe one day I'm gonna turn Matt

and I'm gonna turn Matt King

and I'm gonna show up with a demand ransom letter.

No, screw that.

We have way more to protect here.

There's way more at stake than your personal beef

with someone or your perceived grievance

over what you're owed.

- What would you recommend?

What do you think he should do, can do

to walk it back to heal?

- Decide, this is the curious thing.

He could decide to give this up.

That's very, very difficult

for driven, ambitious people to do.

To accept that they're wrong

and to give up and lay down their sword.

So I had a hope earlier on in this that that was possible.

I haven't seen any evidence

that Matt is interested in that

and I find that deeply regretful,

but that's his prerogative.

I continue to speak out

when he's violating the spirit

and ethics of open source,

but I wish he would just accept

that this was a really bad idea.

He made a bad bet and I thought,

I think he thought he'd just get away with it.

That they'd just pay up and that he could put pressure.

I mean, I know that temptation.

When you sit as the head

of a very important project,

you know that that comes with a great degree of power

and you really need a great degree of discipline

to reign that in and not exercise that power

at every step where you feel aggrieved.

I've felt aggrieved a million times over

in the 20 plus years of Ruby on Rails.

I've really tried very hard not to let those...

sometimes petty, sometimes substantial grievances over time

seep in to the foundation of the ecosystem

and risk ruining everything.

- As the king of the Rails kingdom,

has the power gotten to your head over the years?

- I'm sure it has.

I mean, who wouldn't?

- Do you pace around in your chamber angry?

- I do occasionally.

And I do marvel at both what's been built,

what's been possible.

Over a million applications

have been made with Ruby on Rails

by one estimate that I've seen,

businesses like Shopify and GitHub

and a million others have been built

on top of something that I started.

That's very gratifying.

But you really have to be careful not

to smell your own exhaust too much.

And you have to be just as careful

not to listen too much to the haters

and not to listen too much to the super fans either

that you assess the value

and the sort of principles of what you're working towards

on its own merits, on your own scoreboard.

I try to block that out and then just go,

well I'm working on Rails because I love to write Ruby.

I love to use Ruby to make web applications.

That's my north star.

And I'll continue to do that and I'll continue to share

all of the open source gifts

that I uncover along the ways,

and that's it.

That's enough too.

I don't have to get all of it out of it.

This is sometimes just as with the guy

who thought I'd given up on being Jira or something,

instead of doing Basecamp,

there are people over the years who've asked like,

why didn't you charge for Rails?

Like, don't you know how much money

have been made off Rails?

If we just look at something like Shopify,

it's worth billions of dollars.

I'm not a billionaire

and so freaking what?

I got more than enough.

I got plenty of my share.

I will say though, I'm also introspective enough

to realize that if it hadn't panned out as well

as it did for me on my own business,

maybe I would've been more tempted.

Maybe if you see other people build

huge successful companies off the back of your work

and you really don't have a pot to pissed in,

you might be tempted to get a little upset about that.

I've seen that in the Rails world as well,

where there are people who contributed

substantial bodies of work

and then got really miffed

when they didn't feel like they got enough back.

I was fortunate enough that the business

that Jason and I built with Ruby on Rails

was as successful as it was.

And I made the money I needed to make

that I didn't need to chase the rest of it.

- But we should also just make explicit

that many people in your position

chase the money.

It's not that difficult to chase.

Basically you turned away money.

You made a lot of decisions that just turned away money.

- Maybe, I also think of this example with Matt.

He probably thought there was easy money

for the taking.

And it wasn't so easy, was it?

It looked like low hanging dollar bills

and they turned out to be some really sour grapes.

It turned out

he probably destroyed vast sums of money

by undermining the whole WordPress trust

and the ecosystem

and putting question marks in the heads of folks

who would choose to use WordPress

or something else going forward.

So I often think when people think like,

you left money on the table.

First of all, so what?

I don't have to have all the money.

But second of all,

maybe the money wasn't on the table at all.

- And maybe the cost.

Even if you got the money,

maybe the cost in other ways,

like we've talked about,

would outweigh all the money

that you could have possibly gotten.

Meaning like I think you said that the thing

that makes you happy is flow and tranquility.

Those two things.

Beautifully, really beautifully put.

And it, you know, gaining money might assign

to you responsibility of running a larger thing

that takes away the flow

that you gain from being... fundamentally for you

what flow means is programming.

And then tranquility is like,

I think you also have a beautiful post

of like Nirvana is an empty schedule.

- When I look at a upcoming week

and I see that I have no scheduled meetings at all,

which is quite common,

or maybe I just have one thing for one hour on one day.

I think to myself, do you know what?

This could very easily have been very different.

We could have been running a company of hundreds of people

or thousands of people and my entire calendar

would've been packed solid with little Tetris blocks

of other people's demands on my attention and time,

and I would've been miserable as fuck.

And I look at that and go like that,

what more can I ask for?

Which is a really nice state of being I'd actually say.

I didn't have this always.

I did have early on in my career some sense of like,

I need a little more.

A little more security.

And I remember this really interesting study

where a bunch of researchers asked people

who would made certain amounts of money,

how much money would it take for you to feel secure?

They'd ask people who had a million dollars network?

How much money do you need?

Probably need 2 million.

2 million then I'd be good.

Then they'd ask people with a net worth of 5 million,

how much do you need?

Ah, 10, I need 10.

Ask people with 10 million,

what do you need? 20.

Every single time people

would need double of what they did.

I did that for a couple of doublings

until I realized, you know what?

This is silly.

I am already where I wished

I would be and a million times over.

So what less is there to pursue?

Now that doesn't mean

that if more money is coming my way,

I'm gonna say no to it.

Of course not.

But it does mean that I'm free to set other things higher.

And I also do think you realize,

as Jim Carrey would say,

I wish everyone would get all the money they wished for

and they'd realize it wasn't the answer.

That money solves a whole host of problems and anxieties,

and then it creates a bunch of new ones.

And then it also doesn't touch

a huge swath of the human experience at all.

The world is full of miserable,

anxious, hurt, rich people.

It's also full of miserable, anxious, poor people

and I'd rather be a miserable, anxious, rich person

than a poor person.

But it isn't this magic wand that make everything go away.

And that's again, one of those insights

just like having children

that you cannot communicate in words.

I've never been able to persuade a person

who's not wealthy that wealth wasn't gonna solve

all their problems.

- One quote you've returned to often

that I enjoy a lot is the Coco Chanel quote

of the best things in life are free.

And the second best things are very, very expensive.

And I guess the task is to focus

on surrounding yourself with the best things in life

like family and all of this

and not caring about the other stuff.

- I would easily say you can care about the other stuff.

Just know the order of priority.

If you are blessed with a partner that you love,

some children that you adore,

you've already won the greatest prize

that most humans are able to achieve.

Most humans in this world,

if they are of marital age and they have children,

# Chapter 25

that you cannot communicate in words.

I've never been able to persuade a person

who's not wealthy that wealth wasn't gonna solve

all their problems.

- One quote you've returned to often

that I enjoy a lot is the Coco Chanel quote

of the best things in life are free.

And the second best things are very, very expensive.

And I guess the task is to focus

on surrounding yourself with the best things in life

- I would easily say you can care about the other stuff.

If you are blessed with a partner that you love,

some children that you adore,

you've already won the greatest prize

that most humans are able to achieve.

Most humans in this world,

if they are of marital age and they have children,

if you ask them what's the most important thing,

they would all say that.

They would all say that.

No matter whether they're rich or poor.

It's easy to lose sight of that

when you're chasing the second best things.

Because do you know what?

They're also very nice.

I really like that Pagani Zonda.

It was a very expensive car

and I would have no chance of acquiring it

if I hadn't become rather successful in business.

So I don't wanna dismiss it either.

It's great fun to have money.

It's just not as fun for quite as long

or as deep as you think it is.

And these other things, having an occupation

and a pursuit that you enjoy,

being able to carry burdens with a stiff up of a lip

and with, again, a sense of meaning is incredible.

To have family, to have friends, to have hobbies,

to have all these things that are actually available

to most people around the world, that's winning.

And it doesn't mean you have to discount your ambitions,

it doesn't mean you can't reach for more,

but it does mean it's pretty dumb

if you don't realize that

it's not gonna complete you

in some hocus-pocus woo sense to make more.

It really isn't.

- What gives you hope about the future

of this whole thing we have going on here?

Human civilization.

- I find it easier to be optimistic than pessimistic,

because I don't know either way.

So if I get to choose,

why not just choose to believe it's gonna pan out?

Like we suffer more in our imagination

than we do in reality.

That's one of the quotes out of stoicism.

And I also think we have a tendency,

a lot of humans have a tendency

to be pessimistic in advance

for things they don't know how it's gonna pan out.

Climate change, for example,

is making a lot of people very anxious

and very pessimistic about the future.

You know nothing.

40 years ago we thought the problem

was that the planet was gonna be too cool.

I happen to believe that it's probably correct

that the planet is getting too hot

and that CO2 has something to do with it.

Whether we have the right measures to fix it in time,

if that's even possible or not,

is completely up in the air

and we don't know.

If you convince yourself with such certainty

that the world is gonna turn to shit, it is.

Right up here, in your head today.

Climate change might wipe out this entire species

in 200 years is not next year.

It's not 10 years from now.

Life might become more unpleasant

and there might be more negative effects, and so on.

Yes, okay, but then deal with that hardship

when it arrives.

Don't take that in advance.

How are you helping earth

by just walking around being depressed?

- I think our whole conversation today

is also an indication.

It's just two humans talking.

There's billions of us,

and there is something about us

that wants to solve problems and build cool stuff.

And so we're gonna build our way out

of whatever we get ourselves into.

This is what humans do.

We create problems for ourselves

and come up,

figure out how to build rocket ships

to get out of those problems.

And sometimes the rocket ships

create other problems like nuclear warheads

and then, I'm sure,

I hope, figure out ways how to avoid those problems.

And then there'll be nanobots

and then the aliens will come

and there'll be a massive war

between the nanobots and the aliens,

and that will bring all of us humans together.

- The funny thing,

just to pick up one of the points you mentioned,

the atom bomb, for example.

When that was first invented,

a lot of people thought

we have essentially ended life on earth, right?

Or maybe we prevented World War III

from happening in the past 80 years

because assured mutual annihilation

kept the superpowers from attacking each other

at least head on

and kept their fighting to proxy wars.

You know what?

Proxy wars are not great,

but they're probably better than World War III

with nuclear weapons.

So it's quite difficult in the moment

to tell what's actually benefit and what's not.

And I think we should be a bit more humble.

I've certainly become more humble over time

of thinking I know which way it's gonna turn.

I think the pandemic was a huge moment

for a lot of people

where there was so much certainty

about whether this intervention worked

or that intervention didn't work.

And most people were wrong.

Certainly a lot of very smart people,

very qualified people got that just utterly

and catastrophe finely wrong.

So just a little intellectual humility,

I think back upon that and go like, you know what?

I'm not a PhD in virology

and I don't claim that like I somehow saw

how it always gonna play out.

But the people who were really experts in it,

they got a bunch of it wrong.

Nobody knows anything.

I keep reminding myself of that every day.

No one knows anything.

We can't predict the economy a month out.

We can't predict world affairs a month.

The world is just too complicated.

- Yeah, when I watched the Netflix

documentary "Chimp Empire"

and you know, there's a hierarchy of chimps,

all of that looks eerily similar to us humans.

We're recent descendants.

So these experts,

some of the chimps are got a PhD, others don't.

Others are really muscular.

Others are like beta male kind.

They're sucking up to the alpha.

There's a lot of interesting dynamics going on

that really maps cleanly to the geopolitics of the day.

They don't have nuclear weapons,

but the nature of their behavior is similar to ours.

So I think we barely know what's going on,

but I do think there's like a basic

will to cooperate.

A basic compassion that underlies

just the human spirit that's there.

And maybe that is just me being optimistic.

But if that is indeed there, then we're gonna be okay.

- The capacity is certainly there.

Whether we choose that capacity or not,

who knows and in what situation?

I think accepting that we all have the capacity

for both ways, for both incredible generosity

and kindness and also cruelty.

I think, Young, with this whole theory

of the shadow is really spot on.

That we all have that capacity in us

and accepting that it's our job

to attempt to cultivate the better parts

of our human nature

is weighed against our propensity

to sometime be the worst of ourselves.

- I'm excited to find out what's gonna happen.

It's so awesome to be human.

I don't wanna die.

I kind of wanna be alive for a while

to see all the cool shit we do.

And one of the cool things

I wanna see is all the software you create

and all the things you tweet.

All the trouble you get yourself into on Twitter.

David, yeah, I'm a huge fan like I said.

Thank you for everything you've done for the world,

for the millions of developers you've inspired,

and one of whom is me.
