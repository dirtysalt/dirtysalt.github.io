00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
the following is a conversation with jim keller legendary

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,189
 microprocessor engineer who has worked at amd apple tesla

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,440
 and now intel he's known for his work on amd k 7 k 8 k 12

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,670
 and xen microarchitectures apple a4 and a5 processors

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,410
 and co-author of the specification for the x86 64 instruction

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:26,340
 set and hyper transport interconnect he's

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,230
 a brilliant first principles engineer

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,580
 and out-of-the-box thinker

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,050
 and just an interesting

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,940
 and fun human being to talk to this is the artificial intelligence podcast

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,920
 if you enjoy it subscribe

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,040

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,960
 or simply connect with me on twitter alex

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,860
 friedman spelled fri d ma a.m. i recently

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,050
 started doing ads at the end of the introduction

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,640
 i'll do one or two minutes

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,230
 after introducing the episode

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,070
 and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation i

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,170
 hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience

21
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:07,170
 this show is presented by cash app the number one finance

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,030
 i up in the app store i personally

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,080
 use cash app to send money to friends but you can also use it to buy sell

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,780
 and deposit bitcoin in just seconds cash

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,570
 app also has a new investing feature you

26
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,509
 can buy fractions of a stock say $1 worth no

27
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,880
 matter what the stock price is brokers

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,689
 services are provided by cash app investing a subsidiary of square

29
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,729
 and member si pc i'm

30
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,640
 excited to be working with cash app to support one of my favorite organizations called first best

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,350
 known for their first robotics

32
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,600
 and lego competitions they educate

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,200
 and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,860
 countries and have a perfect rating a charity navigator which

35
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,909
 means that donated money is used to maximum effectiveness when

36
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:52,890
 you get cash app from the app store google play

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,460
 and use code lex podcast you'll

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,420
 get ten dollars and cash app will also donate ten dollars to the first which

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,070
 again is an organization

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,110
 that i've personally seen inspire girls

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,960
 and boys the dream of engineering a better world

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,469
 and

43
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,810
 now here's my with jim keller

44
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,460
 what are the differences in similarities

45
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,340
 between the human brain and a computer with

46
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,440
 the microprocessors core let's

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,610
 start with a philosophical question perhaps well

48
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,290
 since people don't actually understand

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,930
 how human brains work i think

50
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,720
 that's true i think that's true so

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,820
 it's hard to compare them computers are

52
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,290
 you know there's really two things there's memory and there's computation right

53
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:47,520
 and to date almost all computer architectures are global memory which is a thing right

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,600
 and then computation

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,280
 where you pull data and you do relatively simple operations on it and write data back

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,330
 so it's decoupled in modern in modern computers

57
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,270
 and you think in the human brain everything's

58
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,820
 a mesh a mess that's combined together what

59
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,300
 people observe is there's you know some number of layers of neurons

60
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,230
 which have local

61
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,040
 and global connections

62
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,300
 and information is stored in some distributed fashion

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,580
 and people build things called neural networks in computers

64
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:25,350
 where the information is distributed in some kind of fashion you know there's a mathematics behind it i

65
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,880
 don't know that the understandings that is super deep the computations we run on those are straightforward computations

66
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,260
 i don't believe anybody has said a neuron does this computation

67
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,870
 so

68
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,080
 to date it's hard to compare them i

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,030
 would say so let's get into the basics before we zoom back out

70
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,310
 how do you build a computer from scratch

71
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,140
 what is a microprocessor

72
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,120
 what is it microarchitecture

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,880
 what's an instruction set architecture maybe

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,170
 even as far back as what is a transistor

75
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,340
 so

76
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:09,620
 the special charm of computer engineering is there's a relatively good understanding of abstraction layers

77
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,820
 so down to bottom you have atoms

78
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,450
 and atoms get put together in materials like silicon

79
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,320
 or dope silicon

80
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,829
 or metal

81
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:23,020
 and we build transistors on top of that we build logic gates

82
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,720
 right and in functional units like an adder or subtractor or an instruction parsing unit

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,319
 and we assemble those into you know processing elements modern computers are built out of you

84
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,770
 know probably 10 to 20 locally

85
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,900
 you know organic processing elements

86
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,639
 or coherent processing elements

87
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,599
 and then that runs computer programs right

88
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,150
 so there's abstraction layers and then software

89
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:55,569
 you know there's an instruction set you run and then there's assembly language c c++ java javascript

90
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,389
 you know there's abstraction layers you

91
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:01,810
 know essentially from the atom to the data center right

92
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,490
 so when you when you build a computer

93
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,680
 you know first there's a target like what's it for look

94
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,569
 how fast does it have to be which you

95
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:14,169
 know today there's a whole bunch of metrics about what that is and then

96
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:19,389
 in an organization of you know a thousand people who build a computer there's

97
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:22,449
 lots of different disciplines that

98
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,250
 you have to operate on does that make sense and so

99
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,250
 so

100
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,440
 there's a bunch of levels abstraction of in in organizational

101
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,889
 i can tell and in your own vision there's

102
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,969
 a lot of brilliance that comes in it every one of those layers some

103
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:44,590
 of it is science some was engineering some of his art what's the most

104
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,690
 if you could pick favorites what's the most important your favorite layer on

105
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,039
 these layers of abstractions

106
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,969
 where does the magic enter this hierarchy i

107
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,219
 don't really care that's

108
00:05:57,219 --> 00:06:03,310
 the fun you know i'm somewhat agnostic to that so i would say for

109
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,030
 relatively long periods of time instruction sets are stable

110
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,159
 so the x86 instruction said the arm instruction set what's

111
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:18,849
 an instruction set so it says how do you encode the basic operations load store multiply add subtract conditional

112
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:21,610
 branch you know there

113
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,889
 aren't that many interesting instructions look

114
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:24,729
 if you look at a program

115
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:26,259
 and it runs you

116
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:31,120
 know 90% of the execution is on 25 opcodes you know 25 instructions

117
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,729
 on those are stable right

118
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,200
 what does it mean stable until architecture has been around for twenty-five years it

119
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,280
 works it works and that's because the basics you

120
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,830
 know or defined a long time ago right

121
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:53,110
 now the way an old computer ran is you fetched instructions and you executed them in order to

122
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,250
 the load do the ad do the compare the

123
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,010
 way a modern computer works is you fetch large numbers of instructions say 500

124
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,210
 and then you find the dependency graph between the instructions

125
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:14,430
 and then you you execute in independent units those little micro graphs

126
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,970
 so a modern computer like people like to say computers should be simple

127
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,830
 and clean

128
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,810
 but it turns out the market for a simple complete clean slow computers is zero right

129
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,500
 we don't sell any simple clean computers

130
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,880
 now you can there's

131
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,100
 how you build it can be clean

132
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:39,600
 but the computer people want to buy that's say you know phone or data center

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,780
 such as

134
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,910
 a large number of instructions computes the dependency graph and then

135
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,430
 executes it in a way that gets the right answers

136
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,680
 and optimizes that graph somehow

137
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,260
 yeah they run deeply out of order

138
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,850
 and then there's

139
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,100
 semantics around how memory ordering

140
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,420
 works and other things work so the the computer sort of has a bunch of bookkeeping

141
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,230
 tables it says what order cds operations finishing

142
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,540
 or appear to finish him but to go fast you have to fetch a lot of instructions

143
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,800
 and find all the parallelism

144
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,580
 now there's a second kind of computer

145
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,860
 which we call gpus today

146
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,750
 and i called the difference there's

147
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,190
 found parallelism like you have a program with a lot of dependent instructions you

148
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,530
 fetch a bunch and then you go figure out the dependency graph and you issues instructions out order that's

149
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,169
 because you have one serial narrative to execute

150
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,099
 which

151
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,669
 in fact is and can be done out of order you call a narrative

152
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,080
 yeah well

153
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,650
 so

154
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,570
 yeah so humans think of serial narrative

155
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,429
 so read read a book right

156
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,280
 there's a you know there's the sends after sentence after sentence

157
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,690
 and there's paragraphs

158
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,839
 now you could diagram that imagine you diagrammed it properly

159
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,970
 and you said

160
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,810
 which sentences could be read in anti order any order without changing the meaning right

161
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,330
 but that's a fascinating question to ask of a book yeah

162
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,220
 yeah you could do that right

163
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:11,270
 so some paragraphs could be reordered some sentences can be reordered you could say he is tall

164
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,710
 and smart

165
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,050
 and x right

166
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,000
 and it doesn't matter the order of tall and smart

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 but

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,680
 if you say is that tall man who's

169
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,060
 wearing a red shirt what

170
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,680
 colors you know like

171
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,370
 you can create dependencies right right

172
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,680
 and so

173
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,450
 gpus on the other hand run simple programs on pixels

174
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,560
 but you're given a million of them and the first order the screen

175
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,320
 you're looking at it doesn't care which order you do it in so

176
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,900
 i call that given parallelism simple

177
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,440
 narratives around the large numbers of things

178
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,150
 where you can just say it's parallel

179
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,839
 because you told me it was so found parallelism

180
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,440
 where the narrative is it's sequential

181
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,480
 but you discover like

182
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,190
 little pockets of parallelism of versus turns out large pockets of parallelism large

183
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:04,520
 so

184
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,390
 how hard is it to discuss well how hard is it that's just transistor count right

185
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:11,480
 so once you crack the problem you say here's

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,640
 how you fetch ten instructions at a time here's

187
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,550
 how you calculated the dependencies between them here's

188
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,890
 how you describe the dependencies here's you know these are pieces right

189
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,150
 so once

190
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:30,520
 you describe the dependencies then it's just a graph sort of it's an algorithm that finds

191
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,540
 what is that i'm sure there's a graph there is the theoretical answer here that's solved

192
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,320
 well in general programs

193
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,080
 modern programs like human beings right

194
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,459
 how much found

195
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,720
 parallelism is there and on that i max what is 10 next mean oh well

196
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,180
 you execute it in order vs.

197
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,900
 yeah you would get what's called cycles per instruction and it would be about

198
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,260
 you know three instructions three cycles per instruction

199
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,490
 because of the latency of the operations

200
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,280
 and stuff

201
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,100
 and in a modern computer excuse it but like point to 0.25

202
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,890
 cycles per instruction so it's about with today fine 10x

203
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,060
 and there

204
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,770
 and there's two things one is the found parallelism in the narrative right

205
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,910
 and the other is to predictability of the narrative right

206
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,820
 so certain operations

207
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,880
 they do a bunch of calculations and if greater than one do this else do that that

208
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,330
 that decision is predicted in modern computers to high 90% accuracy

209
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,620
 so branches

210
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,670
 happen a lot so imagine you have you have a decision to make every six instructions

211
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,620
 which is about the average right

212
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,390
 but you want to fetch five under instructions

213
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,520
 figure out the graph and execute them all in parallel that means you

214
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,140
 have let's say if you effect 600 instructions it's every six you

215
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,480
 have to fetch you have to predict ninety-nine out of a hundred branches correctly for

216
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,710
 that window to be effective

217
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,580
 okay

218
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,940
 so parallelism you can't paralyze branches

219
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,380
 or you can looking pretty you can what is predict a branch mean

220
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,710
 or

221
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,200
 what open take so imagine you do a computation over

222
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,930
 and over you're in a loop so wow

223
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,270
 and it's greater than one do

224
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,620
 and you

225
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,270
 go through that loop a million times so

226
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,460
 every time you look at the branch you say it's

227
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,950
 probably still greater than one he's

228
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,010
 saying you could do that accurately very accurately monitoring

229
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,390
 comes my mind is blown how

230
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,760
 the heck did you that wait a minute well

231
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,360
 you want to know this is really sad 20 years ago

232
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,640
 yes you simply recorded

233
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,960
 which way the branch went last time and predicted the same thing right

234
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,240
 okay what's the accuracy of that 85%

235
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,170
 so then somebody said

236
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,040
 hey let's keep a couple of bits and have a little counter

237
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,400
 so and it predicts one way we count up and then pins

238
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,060
 so say you have a three bit counter so you count up and then

239
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,890
 count down and if it's you know you can

240
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,980
 use the top bit as the sign bit so you have a sign to bit number

241
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,770
 so if it's greater than one you predict taken and lesson one you predict not-taken right

242
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,590
 or less than zero or whatever the thing is

243
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,540
 and that got us to 92%

244
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,550
 oh

245
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,550
 okay

246
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,440
 i know is this better this branch depends on how you got there

247
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,010
 so

248
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,260
 if you came down the code one way you're talking about bob and jane right

249
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,880
 and then said is just bob

250
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,040
 like jane enoch went one way but if you're talking about

251
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,930
 bob and jill this bob like changes

252
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,730
 you go a different way right

253
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,720
 so that's called history

254
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,140
 so you take the history and a counter that's

255
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,470
 cool but that's not how anything works today they

256
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,180
 use something that looks a little like a neural network

257
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,180
 so

258
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,620
 modern you take all the execution flows and then

259
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:58,290
 you do basically deep pattern recognition of how the program is executing

260
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,050
 and

261
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:05,220
 you do that multiple different ways and you have something that chooses

262
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,029
 what the best result is there's a little supercomputer

263
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,210
 inside the computer that's trying to project that calculates

264
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,460
 which way branches go so

265
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,530
 the effective window that it's worth finding grassing gets bigger

266
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,110
 why was that gonna make me sad that's

267
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,880
 amazing it's amazingly complicated

268
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:32,150
 oh well here's the funny thing so to get to 85% took a thousand bits

269
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,480
 to get to 99% takes

270
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,000
 tens of megabits

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 so

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,220
 this is one of those to

273
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,450
 get the result you want you know to get from a window of say 50

274
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,410
 instructions to 500 it took three orders of magnitudes

275
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,800
 or four orders of magnitude toward bits

276
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
 now

277
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,600
 if you get the prediction of a branch wrong

278
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,370
 what happens then what is the pipe you flush the pipes is just the performance cost

279
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,959
 but it gets even better yeah

280
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,360
 so we're starting to look at stuff that says

281
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,020
 so executed down this path and then

282
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,740
 you had two ways to go but far far

283
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,850
 away there's something that doesn't matter which path you went

284
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:20,730
 so you miss you took the wrong path you executed a bunch of stuff then

285
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:21,690
 you had to miss predicting

286
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,100
 too backed it up but you remembered

287
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,770
 all the results you already calculated

288
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,779
 some of those are just fine look

289
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:32,000
 if you read a book and you misunderstand the paragraph your understanding is the next paragraph

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,670
 sometimes is invariance i don't understand you sometimes it depends on it

291
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,440
 and you can kind of anticipate that invariance

292
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,800
 yeah well you can keep track of whether that data changed

293
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,670
 and so

294
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,920
 when you come back to a piece of code should you calculate

295
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,180
 it again or do the same thing

296
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,899
 okay

297
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,110
 how much does this is art and how much of it is science

298
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,220
 because it sounds pretty complicated so well

299
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,750
 how do you describe a situation so

300
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,860
 imagine you come to a point in the road we have to make a decision right

301
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,029
 and you have a bunch of knowledge about which way to go maybe you have a map

302
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,029
 so

303
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,640
 you want to go is the shortest way or

304
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,600
 do you want to go the fastest

305
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,899
 way or you want to take the nicest road so it's just

306
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,360
 some set of data so imagine

307
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,930
 you're doing something complicated like a building a computer

308
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:28,050
 and there's hundreds of decision points all with hundreds of possible ways to go and the

309
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,540
 ways you pick interacts in a complicated way right

310
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,790
 and then you have to pick the right spot right

311
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,630
 so those are there so i don't know yeah avoided the question you just described

312
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,820
 do the robert frost poem road

313
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,070
 less taken i describe

314
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,880
 the robin truss problem

315
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,040
 which we do as computer designers it's all poetry ok great

316
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
 yeah

317
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,410
 i don't know how to describe that because some

318
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,839
 people are very good at making those intuitive leaps it seems like the combinations of things some

319
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,760
 people are less good at it but they're really good at evaluating your alternatives right

320
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,730
 and everybody has a different way to do it and some people can't make those sleeps

321
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,589
 but they're really good at analyzing it

322
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,400
 so

323
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,859
 when you see computers are designed by teams of people who have very different skill sets and a

324
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,579
 good team has lots of different kinds of people

325
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,380
 and i suspect you would describe some of them as artistic right

326
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,020
 but not very many unfortunately

327
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:39,900
 or fortunately fortunately well you know computer science hard it's 99% perspiration

328
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,309
 and the 1% inspiration is really important

329
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:44,309
 but

330
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:45,450
 i need the 99

331
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,140
 yeah you got to do a lot of work and then there's there

332
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,350
 are interesting things to do at every level that stack

333
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,180
 so at

334
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,070
 the end of the day if you're on the same program multiple times does

335
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:05,840
 it always produce the same result is is there some room for fuzziness there that's a math problem

336
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
 so

337
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,800
 if you run a correct c program the definition is every

338
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,220
 time you run it you get the same answer yeah that well that's a math statement

339
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,950
 but that's a that's a language definitional statement

340
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,580
 so

341
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,780
 yes for years when people did when we first did 3d acceleration of graphics

342
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,910
 you could run the same scene multiple times and get different answers right right

343
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,200
 and then some

344
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,640
 people thought that was okay and some people thought it was a bad idea and then when

345
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,670
 the hpc world used gpus for calculations

346
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,340
 they thought it's a really bad idea okay

347
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:47,000
 now in modern ai stuff people are looking at

348
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 networks

349
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,790
 where the precision of the data is low enough that the date has somewhat noisy

350
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,880
 and the observation as the input data is unbelievably noisy

351
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,610
 so why should the calculation be not noisy

352
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,660
 and people

353
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,000
 have experimented with algorithms that say

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,090
 can get faster answers by being noisy like

355
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,559
 as the network starts to converge

356
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,670
 if you look at the computation graph it starts out really wide and it gets narrower

357
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,460
 and you can say is that last little bit that important

358
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,120
 or should i start to graph on the next rap rev before

359
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,910
 we would live all the way down to the answer right

360
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,150
 so you can create algorithms that are noisy

361
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,230
 now if you're developing something

362
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,360
 and every time you run it you get a different answer it's really annoying and

363
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
 so

364
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,150
 most people think even

365
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,870
 today every time you run the program you get the same answer

366
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,870
 now

367
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,770
 i know but the question is that's the formal

368
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:45,690
 definition of a programming language there is a definition of languages that don't get the same answer

369
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,730
 but people who use those you always want something because you get a bad answer

370
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,430
 and then you're wondering is it because right

371
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,330
 something in your brother

372
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,500
 because of this and

373
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,730
 so everybody wants a little swish that says no matter what ya do it deterministically

374
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,710
 and it's really weird because almost everything going into monetary calculations is noisy

375
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,550
 so why the answers have to be so clear it's right so

376
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,730
 where do you stand by design computers for people who run programs

377
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:12,690
 so

378
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,010
 somebody says i want in deterministic answer like

379
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,600
 most people want that can you deliver a deterministic answer i guess is the question like

380
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,210
 when you hopefully sure that's

381
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,820
 what people don't realize is you get a deterministic

382
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,230
 answer even though the execution flow is very own deterministic

383
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,230
 so

384
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,730
 if you run this program a hundred times it never runs the same way twice ever

385
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:37,530
 and the answer it arises

386
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,990
 the same in but it gets the same answer every time it's just just

387
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,430
 them is just amazing

388
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,790
 okay you've achieved in eyes of

389
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,070
 many people

390
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,460
 legend status as a cheap art architect

391
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,700
 what design creation are you most proud of perhaps

392
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,890
 because it was challenging

393
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,390
 because of its impact

394
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,750
 or

395
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,190
 because of the set of brilliant ideas that that were

396
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:09,390
 involved in well i find that description odd

397
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,040
 and i has two small children

398
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,490
 and i promise you

399
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,500
 they think it's hilarious this question

400
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:16,920
 yeah

401
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,880
 so i dude

402
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,790
 so i i'm

403
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,250
 i'm really interested in building computers

404
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:31,020
 and i've worked with really really smart people i'm not unbelievably smart i'm fascinated by

405
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,450
 how they go together both as a as

406
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,370
 a thing to do and is endeavor that people do

407
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,710
 how people in computers go together yeah like

408
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,610
 how people think

409
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,950
 and build a computer

410
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:49,080
 and i find sometimes that the best computer architects aren't that interested in people

411
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:53,510
 or the best people managers aren't that good at designing computers

412
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,880
 so the whole stack of human beings is fascinating

413
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,060
 so the managers individual engineers

414
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,350
 yeah i just i said i realized

415
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,150
 after a lot of years of building computers

416
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,700
 where you sort of build them out of the transistors logic gates functional units come computational elements that

417
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,150
 you could think of people the same way so people are functional units

418
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,570
 yes

419
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:15,840
 and then you can think of organizational design it's a computer architectural problem

420
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,220
 and then

421
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,840
 it's like oh that's super

422
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,840
 cool because the people are all different just like the computation

423
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,210
 elephants are all different and they

424
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,640
 like to do different things and

425
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
 and

426
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,980
 so i had a lot of fun like reframing

427
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,330
 how i think about organizations just like with with

428
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,370
 computers we were saying execution

429
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,960
 paths you can have a lot of different paths that end up at a at

430
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
 at the same good destination

431
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,730
 so

432
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,300
 what have you learned about the human

433
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:51,350
 abstractions from individual functional human units to the broader organization

434
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,850
 what does it take to create something special well

435
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,390
 most people don't think simple enough

436
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,460
 all right so do you know the difference between a recipe

437
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,450
 and understanding

438
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,450
 there's

439
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,280
 probably a philosophical description of this so imagine you can make a loaf of bread yeah

440
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,950
 the recipe says get some flour add some water add some yeast mix it up let it rise put

441
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,470
 it in a pan put it in the oven it's

442
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,370
 a recipe right understanding bread you

443
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,060
 can understand biology supply chains you

444
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,130
 know grain grinders yeast physics

445
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,560
 you know thermodynamics like there's

446
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,520
 so many levels of understanding there and then when people build

447
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,550
 and design things they frequently are executing some stack of recipes right

448
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:49,020
 and the problem with that is the recipes all have a limited scope look

449
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,400
 if you have a really good recipe

450
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,990
 book for making bread it won't tell you anything about how to make an omelet right right but

451
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,680
 if you have a deep understanding of cooking

452
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,380
 right then bread

453
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,270
 omelets you know sandwich you know there's there's a different you know way of viewing everything

454
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,730
 and most

455
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:13,140
 people when you get to be an expert at something you

456
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,320
 know you're you're hoping to achieve deeper understanding

457
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,110
 not just a large set of recipes to go execute

458
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,100
 and it's interesting the walk groups of people because xqt

459
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,000
 reps apiece is unbelievably efficient if it's

460
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,100
 what you want to do if it's not what you want to do you're really stuck

461
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,200
 and

462
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,429
 and that difference is crucial

463
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:37,000
 and ever

464
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,870
 and everybody has a balance of let's say deeper understanding recipes

465
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:43,960
 and some people are really good at recognizing when

466
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,830
 the problem is to understand something dp deeply that

467
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,740
 make sense it totally makes sense does

468
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,909
 it every stage of development deep on understanding on the team needed

469
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:58,870
 oh this goes back to the art versus science question sure

470
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,850
 if you constantly unpacked everything for deeper understanding you never get anything done right

471
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,269
 and

472
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,169
 if you don't unpack understanding when you need to you'll do the wrong thing

473
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,120
 and then at every juncture like human beings are these really weird things

474
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,679
 because everything

475
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,799
 you tell them has a million possible outputs all

476
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,669
 right and then they all interact in a hilarious way

477
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,389
 and then having

478
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:25,779
 some intuition about what you tell them what you do when do you intervene

479
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,019
 when do you not it's it's complicated all right

480
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:32,830
 so it's you know essentially computationally unsolvable

481
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,970
 yeah it's an intractable problem sure

482
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,210
 humans are a mess but

483
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:47,580
 with deep understanding do you mean also sort of fundamental questions of things like

484
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,159
 what is a computer

485
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,419
 or

486
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:58,570
 why like think the why question is why are we even building this like of purpose

487
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,309
 or do you mean more

488
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:05,740
 like going towards the fundamental limits of physics sort of really getting

489
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,820
 into the core of the sighs well in terms of building the computer thinks

490
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,340
 simple think a little simpler

491
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,409
 so common practice is you build a computer

492
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:17,889
 and then when somebody says i want to make it 10% faster you'll

493
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,059
 go in and say alright

494
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:23,500
 i need to make this buffer bigger and maybe i'll add an ad unit or you

495
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,779
 know i have this thing that's three instructions wide i'm going to make it four instructions wide and

496
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:33,669
 what you see is each piece gets incrementally more complicated right

497
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:38,440
 and then at some point you hit this limit like adding another feature

498
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,289
 or a buffer doesn't seem to make it any faster and

499
00:26:41,289 --> 00:26:44,409
 then people say well that's because it's a fundamental limit

500
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:45,639
 and then

501
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:48,399
 somebody else to look at it and say well actually the way you divided

502
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:52,839
 the problem up and the way that different features are interacting is limiting

503
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:55,839
 you and it has to be rethought rewritten right

504
00:26:55,839 --> 00:27:00,070
 so then you refactor it and rewrite it and what people commonly find is

505
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,959
 the rewrite is not only faster

506
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:04,089
 but half is complicated from scratch

507
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:04,599
 yes

508
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,229
 so

509
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,089
 how often in your career

510
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:09,489
 but just have you seen as needed

511
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:13,989
 maybe more generally to just throw the whole out thing

512
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:17,289
 out this is where i'm on one end of it every

513
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:18,329
 three to five years

514
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:23,019
 which end are you on like rewrite more often right

515
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:23,679
 and three

516
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,389
 or five years is if you want to really make a lot of progress on computer architecture every

517
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:31,109
 five years you should do one from scratch

518
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,109
 so

519
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:36,489
 where does the x86 64 standard come in or

520
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:39,129
 what how often do you i wrote

521
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:43,149
 the i was the co-author that's back in 98 that's 20 years ago

522
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:44,049
 yeah

523
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:49,359
 so that's still around the instruction set it stuff has been extended quite a few times yes

524
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,419
 and instruction sets are less interesting

525
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:54,940
 and implementation underneath there's

526
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,070
 been on x86 architecture

527
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,599
 intel's designed a few eames is designed a few very different architectures

528
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,019
 and i

529
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,389
 don't want to go into too much of the detail about how often

530
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:09,519
 but it's

531
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,309
 there's a tendency to rewrite it every you know 10 years and it really should be every five

532
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:15,309
 so

533
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:18,190
 you're saying you're an outlier in that sense in really

534
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,239
 more often we write more often well in here isn't that scary

535
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:26,469
 yeah of course well scary - who - everybody involved

536
00:28:26,469 --> 00:28:28,599
 because like you said repeating

537
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,149
 the recipe is efficient companies

538
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:34,029
 want to make money well

539
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:38,440
 no in the individual juniors want to succeed so you want to incrementally

540
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,639
 improve increase the buffer from three to four well we get

541
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:45,700
 into the diminishing return curves i think

542
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,760
 steve jobs said this right so every you have a project

543
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,700
 and you start here and it goes up and they have domitian return

544
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,570
 and to get to the next level you have to do a new one in the initial

545
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,920
 starting point will

546
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,290
 be lower than the old optimization

547
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,020
 point but it'll get higher

548
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,020
 so

549
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:05,440
 now you have two kinds of fear short-term disaster

550
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,370
 and long-term disaster

551
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,660
 and you're you're wrong

552
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,380
 right like

553
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:17,710
 you know people with a quarter by quarter business objective are terrified about changing everything yeah

554
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,590
 and people who are trying to run a business

555
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,890
 or build a computer for a long term objective know that the short-term limitations block

556
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,500
 them from the long term success

557
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 so

558
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,650
 if you look at leaders of companies

559
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,470
 that had really good long-term success every

560
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,070
 time they saw that they had to redo something they did and

561
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,380
 so somebody has to speak up or you

562
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,900
 do multiple projects in parallel like you optimize

563
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,840
 the old one while you build a new one and

564
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,910
 but the marketing guys they're always like make promise

565
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,880
 me that the new computer is faster on every single thing

566
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,920
 and the computer architect says well the new computer will be faster on the average

567
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,030
 but there's a distribution

568
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,350
 or results in performance

569
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,180
 and you'll have some outliers that are slower

570
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,860
 and that's very hard because they have one customer cares about that one so speaking

571
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,530
 of the long-term for over 50 years now moore's law has served a for

572
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,440
 me and millions of others as an inspiring beacon

573
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,450
 what kind of amazing future brilliant engineers can build no i'm

574
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,680
 just making your kids laugh all of today it was great

575
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,820
 so

576
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,210
 first in your eyes what is moore's law if you could define for people who don't know

577
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,200
 well the simple

578
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,230
 statement was from gordon moore was double the number of transistors every two years something

579
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,390
 like that and then my operational model is we

580
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:46,690
 increased the performance of computers by 2x

581
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,170
 every 2 or 3 years and it's wiggled around substantially

582
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,390
 over time and also in

583
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,850
 how we deliver performance has changed

584
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,720
 but the foundational

585
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,020
 idea was to x two transistors every two years the

586
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:08,090
 current cadence is something like they call it a shrink factor like

587
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,030
 point six every two years which is not 0.5

588
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:17,030
 but that that's referring strictly again to the original definition of transistor count a shrink

589
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:20,990
 factors just getting them smaller small as well as you use for a constant chip area

590
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,010
 if you

591
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,750
 make the transistor smaller by 0.6 then you get 1 over 0.6 more transistors

592
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,020
 so can you linger a little longer what's what's

593
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,180
 a broader what do you think should be the broader definition of moore's law we mentioned before how

594
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,090
 you think of performance just

595
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,560
 broadly what's a good way to think about moore's law well

596
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,000
 first of all so

597
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,200
 i i've been aware of moore's law for 30 years in

598
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,200
 what sense well i've been designing computers for 40 just watching

599
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,050
 it before your eyes kind of slow and somewhere

600
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:59,300
 where i became aware of it i was also informed that

601
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,330
 moore's law was gonna die in 10 to 15 years

602
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,590
 and i thought that was true at first

603
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,790
 but then after 10 years it was gonna die in 10 to 15 years and then

604
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,590
 at one point it was gonna die in 5 years

605
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,560
 and then it went back up to ten years and at some point i decided

606
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,690
 not to worry about that particular

607
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,740
 product mastication for the rest of my life

608
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,490
 which is which is fun

609
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,990
 and then i joined intel

610
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,980
 and everybody said moore's law is dead and i thought that's sad because it's the moore's law company

611
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:29,870
 and it's not dead and it's always been gonna die and you

612
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,850
 know humans you like these apocryphal

613
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,400
 kind of statements like we'll

614
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,240
 run out of food or run out of air or

615
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,130
 you know something right

616
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,850
 but it's still incredible this lived for as long as it has

617
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:44,360
 and

618
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,350
 yes

619
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:51,380
 there's many people who believe now that moore's law instead you know they

620
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,580
 can join the last 50 years of people had the thing yeah there's a long tradition

621
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:00,140
 but why do you think if you can in touch try

622
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,260
 to understand it why do you think it's not dead well

623
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,810
 for hartley let's just think people

624
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,290
 think moore's law is one thing transistors get smaller

625
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:12,020
 but actually under the sheets ours literally thousands of innovations

626
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,510
 and almost all those innovations have their own diminishing return curves

627
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,510
 so

628
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,650
 if you graph it it looks like a cascade of diminishing return curves i don't

629
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:26,750
 know what to call that but the result is an exponential curve at

630
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,070
 least it has been so

631
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,630
 and we

632
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:34,780
 keep inventing new things so if you're an expert in one of the things on a diminishing return curve

633
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,780
 right

634
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,690
 and you can see it's plateau you will

635
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,560
 probably tell people well this is this is done meanwhile

636
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,740
 some other pile of people are doing something different

637
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,780
 so that's that's just normal

638
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:53,230
 so then there's the observation of how small could a switching device be

639
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:59,090
 so a modern transistor is something like a thousand by a thousand by thousand atoms right

640
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,820
 and you get quantum effects down around two to two to ten atoms

641
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,730
 so you can imagine the transistor as small as 10 by 10 by 10

642
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,870
 so that's a million times smaller

643
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:16,629
 and then the quantum computational people are working away at how to use quantum effects

644
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:19,510
 so a

645
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:22,840
 thousand by thousand five thousand atoms

646
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:28,820
 it's a really clean way of putting it well fin like a modern transistor

647
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,440
 if you look at the fan it's like a hundred

648
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,210
 and twenty atoms wide but

649
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,659
 we can make that thinner and then there's there's a gate wrapped around it

650
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,969
 and under spacing there's a whole bunch of geometry

651
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:47,139
 and you know a competent transistor designer could count both atoms in every single direction

652
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,179
 like there's techniques now to already put down atoms in a single atomic layer

653
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,139
 and you can place atoms

654
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,940
 if you want to it's

655
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:58,010
 just you know from

656
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,600
 a manufacturing process if placing an atom takes ten minutes and you need to put

657
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,960
 you know 10 to the 23rd atoms together to make a computer it would take a long time

658
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,500
 so the the methods are you know both shrinking things

659
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,590
 and then coming up with effective ways to control what's happening

660
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,460
 manufacture stabling cheaply

661
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,560
 yeah

662
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,730
 so the innovation stocks

663
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,680
 pretty broad you know there there's

664
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,220
 equipment there's optics there's chemistry there's physics there's material science there's metallurgy there's

665
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,500
 lots of ideas about when you put their four materials together

666
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,140
 how they interact are they stable is i stable

667
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,000
 or temperature you

668
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,650
 know like are they repeatable you know there's look there's like

669
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,570
 literally thousands of technologies involved

670
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:49,400
 but just for the shrinking you don't think we're quite yet close to the fundamental

671
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,200
 limit in physics i did

672
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,480
 a talk on moore's law and i asked for a road

673
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,800
 map to a path of 100

674
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,690
 and after two weeks they

675
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,480
 said we only got to fifty a hundred what's

676
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,000
 a 100 extra hundred shrink we

677
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,850
 only got 15 i said once you go to another two weeks

678
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,590
 well here's the thing about moore's law right

679
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,950
 so i believe that

680
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:15,950
 the next 10 or 20 years of shrinking is going to happen right

681
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,190
 now as a computer designer there's

682
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:23,960
 you have two stances you think it's going to shrink in which case you're designing

683
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,060
 and thinking about architecture in a way that you'll use more transistors

684
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
 or

685
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:35,690
 conversely not be swamped by the complexity of all the transistors you get right

686
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,930
 you have to have a strategy

687
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,450
 you know so you're open to the possibility

688
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:44,900
 and waiting for the possibility of a whole new army of transistors

689
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,970
 ready to work i'm expecting

690
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:52,880
 expecting more transistors every two or three years by a number large enough that

691
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,200
 how you think about design

692
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,350
 how you think about architecture has to change like

693
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:01,520
 imagine you're you build built brick buildings out of bricks and every

694
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,520
 year the bricks are half the size

695
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,990
 or every two years well

696
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,330
 if you kept building bricks the same way you know

697
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,420
 so many bricks per person per day the

698
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:17,090
 amount of time to build a building would go up exponentially right right but

699
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,340
 if you said i know that's coming

700
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,340
 so

701
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,140
 now i'm going to design equipment

702
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,570
 and moves bricks faster uses them better because

703
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:27,620
 maybe you're getting something out of the smaller bricks more strengths inner walls you

704
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,470
 know less material efficiency out of that so

705
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,770
 once you have a roadmap with what's going to happen transistors

706
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:37,730
 they're gonna get we're gonna get more of them then you design

707
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,560
 was collateral rounded to take advantage of it and also to cope with it like

708
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,700
 that's the thing people to understand

709
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,690
 it's like if i didn't

710
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,850
 believe in moore's law and moore's

711
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,830
 law transistors showed up my design teams were all drowned

712
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:57,050
 so what's the what's the hardest part of this in flood of new transistors

713
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,160
 i mean even

714
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,450
 if you just look historically throughout your career what's

715
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,340
 what's the thing you what

716
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:10,910
 fundamentally changes when you add more transistors in in the task of designing an architecture no

717
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:15,100
 there's there's two constants right one is people don't get smarter i

718
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,530
 think by the way there's some size shown that we do get smarter

719
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,470
 because nutrition whatever sorry

720
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:24,560
 bring that what effect yes nobody understands

721
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,800
 it nobody knows if it's still going on so that's all or whether

722
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,580
 it's real or not but yeah that's a i sort of amen

723
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,630
 but not if i believe for the most part people aren't getting much smarter the

724
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:40,250
 evidence doesn't support it that's right and then teams can't grow that much right

725
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,950
 all right so human beings understand

726
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,830
 you know we're really good in teams of ten you

727
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,410
 know up two teams of a hundred they can know each other beyond

728
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,930
 that you have to have organizational boundaries so

729
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:54,470
 you're kind of you have those are pretty hard constraints all

730
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,820
 right so then you have to divide

731
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,359
 and conquer

732
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:00,410
 like as the designs get bigger you have to divide it into pieces you know

733
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,260
 that the power of abstraction layers is really high we used to build computers out of transistors

734
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,970
 now we have a team that turns transistors

735
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,510
 and logic

736
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,310
 cells and our team that turns them into functional

737
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,100
 you know it's another one it turns in computers right

738
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,840
 so we have abstraction layers in there and

739
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
 you

740
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,410
 have to think about when do you shift gears on that we

741
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,440
 also use faster computers to build faster computers so

742
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,020
 some algorithms run twice as fast on new computers

743
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,560
 but a lot about rhythms are n squared

744
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,290
 so you know a computer with twice as many transistors

745
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,650
 and it might take four tom's times as long to run so

746
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,380
 you have to refactor at the software like

747
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,330
 simply using faster computers to build bigger computers doesn't work

748
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,330
 so

749
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:47,750
 so you have to think about all these things so in terms of computing performance

750
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:52,660
 and the exciting possibility that more powerful computers bring is shrinking

751
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,720
 the thing we've been talking about

752
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,160
 one of the for you one of the biggest exciting possibilities of advancement in performance

753
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,150
 or is there are other directions that you're interested in like like

754
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,570
 in the direction of sort of enforcing given parallelism

755
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,700
 or like doing

756
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,050
 massive parallelism in terms of many many cpus you

757
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,370
 know stacking cpus on top of each other that kind of that kind of parallelism

758
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,070
 or you kind of well think about it a different way

759
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,270
 so old

760
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:29,840
 computers you know slow computers you said a equal b plus c times d pretty simple right

761
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,410
 and then we made faster computers with vector units

762
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,380
 and you can do proper equations

763
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,300
 and matrices right

764
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,970
 and then modern like ai computations

765
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:46,550
 or like convolutional neural networks we you convolve one large data set against another and

766
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,860
 so there's

767
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,930
 sort of this hierarchy of mathematics

768
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,460
 you know from simple

769
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:58,070
 equation to linear equations to matrix equations to it's a deeper kind of computation

770
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:00,080
 and the data sets are getting

771
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,500
 so big that people are thinking of data as a topology

772
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,160
 problem you know data is organized in some immense shape

773
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,870
 and then the computation

774
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,390
 which sort of wants to be get

775
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,180
 data from immense shape and do some computation

776
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,670
 on it so the with

777
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:21,640
 computers of a lot of people to do is how about rhythms go much much further

778
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
 so

779
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:26,720
 that that paper you you reference the sutton paper they

780
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,060
 talked about you know like in a i started

781
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,000
 it was a ploy rule sets to something that's

782
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,120
 a very simple computational situation

783
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,320
 and then when they did first chess thing they solved deep searches

784
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,530
 so have a huge database of moves

785
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,840
 and results deep search but it's still just a search right

786
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,360
 now we we take large numbers of images

787
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,500
 and we use it to train these weight sets that

788
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,000
 we convolve across it's a completely different kind of phenomena we

789
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,330
 call that ai now they're doing the next generation

790
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:07,319
 and if you look at it they're going up this mathema graph right

791
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:10,380
 and then computations the both computation

792
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,410
 and data sets support going up that graph

793
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,039
 yeah

794
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,029
 the kind of computation

795
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:20,160
 of my i mean i would argue that all of it is still a search right just

796
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,460
 like you said a topology problems data says he's searching the data sets for valuable

797
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:32,009
 data and also the actual optimization of your networks is a kind of search for

798
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:36,319
 the i don't know if you looked at the inner layers of finding a cat

799
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,039
 it's not a search it's it's a set of endless projection

800
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,539
 so you know projection

801
00:42:42,539 --> 00:42:44,069
 and here's a shadow of this phone

802
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:45,809
 yeah right then

803
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,960
 you can have a shadow of that onto something a shadow on that or something

804
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,509
 if you look in the layers you'll see this layer actually describes pointy ears and round eyeness

805
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:55,380
 and fuzziness

806
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:55,730
 and

807
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:03,839
 but the computation to tease out the attributes is not search right

808
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,880
 ain't like the inference part might be searched

809
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,200
 but the trainings not search

810
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,240
 okay well 10 then in deep networks

811
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,869
 they look at layers and they don't even know it's represented

812
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:14,730
 and yet

813
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,859
 if you take the layers out it doesn't work ok

814
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:18,990
 so if i don't think it's search all

815
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,990
 right well but you have to talk to my mathematician about what that actually is

816
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:23,970
 oh you disagree

817
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,940
 but the the it's just semantics

818
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,049
 i think it's not but it's certainly not i would say it's absolutely not semantics

819
00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:32,720
 but okay

820
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,170
 all right well

821
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:36,170
 if you want to go there

822
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,849
 so optimization to me is search

823
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,880
 and we're trying to optimize

824
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,730
 the ability of a neural network to detect cat ears

825
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,240
 and this difference between chess

826
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,910
 and the space the incredibly

827
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,440
 multi-dimensional hundred thousand

828
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,559
 dimensional space that you know networks are trying to optimize over is nothing like the chessboard database

829
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:06,150
 so it's a totally different kind of thing and okay in that sense you can say

830
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,650
 yeah yeah you

831
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:11,369
 know i could see how you you might say if if you the

832
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:15,150
 funny thing is it's the difference between given search space

833
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,130
 and found search space exactly

834
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:19,140
 yeah maybe that's a different way beautiful

835
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,849
 but okay but you're saying what's your sense in terms of the basic mathematical operations

836
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:26,909
 and the architectures

837
00:44:26,909 --> 00:44:28,619
 can be hardwired that enables

838
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:35,999
 those operations do you see the cpus of today still being a really core part of executing

839
00:44:35,999 --> 00:44:37,319
 those mathematical operations

840
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:42,509
 yes well the operations you know continue to be add subtract loads

841
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:43,439
 or compare

842
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:45,599
 and branch it's it's remarkable

843
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,009
 so it's it's interesting that the building blocks of you know computers

844
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:50,880
 or transistors

845
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,380
 and you know under that atoms

846
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,069
 so you got atoms transistors logic gates computers right

847
00:44:56,069 --> 00:45:02,759
 you know functional units and computers the building blocks of mathematics at some level are things like adds

848
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:04,199
 and subtracts and multiplies

849
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:09,299
 but that's the space mathematics can describe is i think

850
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:10,429
 essentially infinite

851
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:15,839
 but the computers that run the algorithms are still doing the same things

852
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,489
 now a given algorithm may say i need sparse data or

853
00:45:20,489 --> 00:45:21,569
 i need 32-bit data

854
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:22,049
 or

855
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:24,959
 i need you know like

856
00:45:24,959 --> 00:45:29,459
 a convolution operation that naturally takes 8-bit data multiplies

857
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:34,549
 it and sums it up a certain way so the like the data types in tensorflow

858
00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:37,499
 imply an optimization set

859
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:43,279
 but when you go write down a look at the computers it's an inorganic salt applies like

860
00:45:43,279 --> 00:45:45,630
 like that hasn't changed much

861
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,859
 now the quantum researchers think they're going to change that radically

862
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:52,199
 and then there's people who think about analog computing

863
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:55,949
 because you look in the brain and it seems to be more analog ish you

864
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,469
 know that maybe there's a way to do that more efficiently

865
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:02,549
 but we have a million acts on computation

866
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:10,319
 and i don't know the reference the relationship between computational let's say intensity

867
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,249
 and ability to hit match mathematical abstractions i don't know anyway subscribe dad

868
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:17,579
 but

869
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,449
 but just like you saw an ai you went from rule

870
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:26,609
 sets the simple search to complex search does a found search like

871
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:30,720
 those are you know orders of magnitude more computation to do

872
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,650
 and

873
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,250
 as we get the next two orders of magnitude

874
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:39,859
 your friend roger godori said like every order magnitude changed the computation

875
00:46:39,859 --> 00:46:41,339
 fundamentally changes

876
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:44,849
 what the computation is doing here oh you

877
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:48,589
 know the expression the difference in quantity is the difference in kind

878
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:50,760
 you know the difference between ant

879
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,800
 and ant hill right

880
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,640
 or neuron

881
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:58,740
 and brain you know there's there's there's just indefinable place

882
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,400
 where the the quantity changed the quality right

883
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,240
 now we've seen that happen in mathematics multiple times and you

884
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,599
 know my my guess is it's gonna keep happening so your senses

885
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:09,930
 yeah

886
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:15,000
 if you focus head down and shrinking a transistor let's

887
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,310
 not just head down and we're aware about

888
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:22,050
 the software stacks that are running in the computational loads and we're kind of pondering

889
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,790
 what do you do with a petabyte

890
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,240
 of memory that wants to be accessed in a sparse way and

891
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,849
 have you know the kind of calculations ai programmers want

892
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,650
 so there's that there's a dialog interaction

893
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,599
 but when you go in the computer chip you know you find adders

894
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,130
 and subtractors and multipliers

895
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:42,290
 and

896
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,290
 so

897
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,480
 if you zoom out then with as you mentioned

898
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,400
 which sutton the idea

899
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:54,089
 that most of the development in the last many decades in the ai research came from just leveraging computation

900
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:57,420
 and just the simple algorithms

901
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:03,900
 waiting for the computation to improve well suffer guys have a thing that they called the

902
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,359
 the problem of early optimization right

903
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:07,230
 so

904
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:08,670
 if you write a big software stack

905
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:09,240
 and

906
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,829
 if you start optimizing like

907
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:15,569
 the first thing you write the odds of that being the performance limiter is low but

908
00:48:15,569 --> 00:48:19,050
 when you get the whole thing working can you make it to x faster by optimizing

909
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,270
 the right things sure while

910
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,210
 you're optimizing that could you've written a new software stack

911
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,250
 which would have been a better choice maybe

912
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:28,640
 now you have creative tension

913
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,640
 so

914
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,819
 but the whole time as you're doing the writing the

915
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:36,660
 that's the software we're talking about the hardware underneath gets faster

916
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:43,589
 which goes back to the moore's laws moore's law is going to continue then your ai research

917
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:44,729
 should expect

918
00:48:44,729 --> 00:48:48,809
 that to show up and then you make a slightly different set of choices then we've

919
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:50,160
 hit the wall nothing's

920
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,140
 gonna happen and from here it's just us rewriting algorithms like

921
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,880
 that seems like a failed strategy for the last 30 years of moore's laws death

922
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,880
 so

923
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:04,380
 so can you just linger on it i think you've answered it

924
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,140
 but it just asked the same dumb question over and over so

925
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,900
 what why do you think moore's law is not going to die

926
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,939
 which is the most promising exciting

927
00:49:14,939 --> 00:49:20,640
 possibility of why it won't done that's five 10 years so is it that continues shrinking the transistor

928
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,689
 or is it another s-curve that steps in and it totally

929
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:30,390
 so dope shrinking the transistor is literally thousands of innovations right

930
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,699
 so there's so this they're all answers

931
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,329
 and it's there's a whole bunch of s-curves just kind of running their course

932
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:38,249
 and being reinvented

933
00:49:38,249 --> 00:49:43,579
 and new things you know the the semiconductor

934
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:44,579
 fabricators

935
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,249
 and technologists have all announced what's called nano wires

936
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:48,900
 so they they took a fan

937
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,439
 which had a gate around it and turned that into a little wire

938
00:49:52,439 --> 00:49:53,880
 so you have better control that

939
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,539
 and they're smaller

940
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:58,489
 and then from there there's some obvious steps about how to shrink that

941
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:02,249
 so the metallurgy around wire stocks

942
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:07,949
 and stuff has very obvious abilities to shrink and you

943
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:11,099
 know there's a whole combination of things there to do your

944
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:12,539
 sense is that we're gonna get a lot

945
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:15,799
 yes this innovation from just that shrinking

946
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:18,589
 yeah like a factor of a hundred salade

947
00:50:18,589 --> 00:50:21,660
 yeah i would say that's incredible

948
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,989
 and it's totally it's only 10 or 15 years

949
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:28,229
 now you're smarter you might know but to me it's totally unpredictable of

950
00:50:28,229 --> 00:50:33,329
 what that hundred x would bring in terms of the nature of the computation

951
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:36,469
 and people be yeah you familiar with bell's law

952
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:39,299
 so for a long time those mainframes

953
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:46,079
 mini's workstation pc mobile moore's law drove faster smaller computers right

954
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,549
 and then we

955
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:53,249
 were thinking about moore's law rajae godori said every 10x generates a new computation

956
00:50:53,249 --> 00:51:00,020
 so scalar vector made erichs topological computation right

957
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,020
 and

958
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,740
 if you go look at the industry trans there was no mainframes

959
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:06,570
 and mini-computers and pcs

960
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:10,589
 and then the internet took off and then we got mobile devices

961
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:10,890
 and

962
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,910
 now we're building 5g wireless with one millisecond latency and

963
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:19,200
 people are starting to think about the smart world where everything knows

964
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,050
 you recognizes you like

965
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:26,730
 like like the transformations are going to be like unpredictable

966
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:31,339
 how does it make you feel that you're one of the key

967
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:38,540
 architects of this kind of futures you're not we're not talking about the architects of the high-level

968
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,820
 people who build the angry bird apps

969
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,859
 and flapping

970
00:51:43,859 --> 00:51:47,099
 angry bird of who knows we're gonna be that's the whole point of the universe

971
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:50,520
 let's take a stand at that and the attention

972
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,290
 distracting nature of mobile

973
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,810
 phones i'll take a stand but anyway in terms of that matters much

974
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,599
 the the side effects of smartphones

975
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,640
 or the attention distraction

976
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,690
 which part well who knows you know where this is all leading it's changing

977
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,700
 so fast wax my parents

978
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,660
 do steal my sister's

979
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,770
 for hiding in the closet with

980
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,349
 a wired phone with a dial on it stop

981
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:15,020
 talking your friends all day right

982
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,020
 now

983
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,000
 my wife feels with my kids for talking to their friends all day on text looks

984
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,560
 the same to me it's always it's echoes of the same thing okay but you are the one

985
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,390
 of the key people architecting

986
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,099
 the hardware of this future

987
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,780
 how does that make you feel do you feel responsible

988
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,210
 do you feel excited

989
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:38,130
 so we're we're in a social context

990
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:41,010
 so there's billions of people on this planet there

991
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:47,359
 are literally millions of people working on technology i feel lucky to be

992
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,230
 you know what doing

993
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,950
 what i do and getting paid for it and there's an interest in it but

994
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:56,280
 there's so many things going on in parallel it's like

995
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:01,290
 the actions are so unpredictable if i wasn't here somebody else are doing the

996
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:05,210
 the vectors of all these different things are happening all the time

997
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:10,170
 you know there's a i'm sure some philosopher

998
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:15,410
 or meta philosophers you know wondering about how we transform our world

999
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:20,240
 so you can't deny the fact that these tools whether

1000
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,240
 that

1001
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,599
 these tools are changing our world that's

1002
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:27,330
 right do you think it's

1003
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,950
 changing for the better so

1004
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:33,930
 some of these i read this thing recently it said the peat the two disciplines with

1005
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:39,300
 the highest gre scores in college are physics in philosophy right

1006
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,710
 and they're both sort of trying to answer the question why is there anything right

1007
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,580
 and the philosopher's you know are on the kind of theological side

1008
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:54,839
 and the physicists are obviously on the you know the material side and there's a hundred billion galaxies

1009
00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:00,170
 with a hundred billion stars it seems well repetitive at best

1010
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:05,490
 so i you know there's on our way to ten billion people

1011
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,359
 i mean it's hard to say what it's all for is that's what you're asking

1012
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:15,290
 yeah i guess i guess i do tend to are significantly increases in complexity

1013
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,480
 and i'm curious about

1014
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,520
 how

1015
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:26,760
 computation like like our world our physical world inherently generates mathematics it's kind of obvious right

1016
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,920
 so we have x y z coordinates you

1017
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,859
 take a sphere you make it bigger you get a surface that falls

1018
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,200
 you know grows by r-squared like

1019
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,300
 it generally generates mathematics

1020
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,349
 and the mathematicians

1021
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:38,280
 and the physicists

1022
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:44,070
 have been having a lot of fun talking to each other for years and computation has been let's

1023
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,369
 say relatively pedestrian like computation

1024
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:54,060
 in terms of mathematics has been doing binary binary algebra while those guys have been gallivanting

1025
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:57,900
 through the other realms of possibility right

1026
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,170
 now recently the computation

1027
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:07,470
 lets you do math m'q mathematical computations that are sophisticated enough that nobody understands

1028
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,960
 how the answers came out right

1029
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,430
 machine learning machine lying yeah it used to be you get data set you

1030
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:21,240
 guess at a function the function is considered physics if it's predictive of new functions

1031
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:26,090
 data sets modern

1032
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,090
 you

1033
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,100
 can take a large data set with no intuition

1034
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,990
 about what it is and use machine learning to find a pattern that has no function right

1035
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:39,720
 and it can arrive at results that i don't know if they're completely mathematically describable

1036
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,020
 so a computation is kind of done

1037
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,400
 something interesting compared to a pov plus see there's

1038
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,960
 something reminiscent of that step from the basic operations of addition

1039
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,660
 to taking a step towards new all networks that's reminiscent of

1040
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,170
 what life on earth and its origins was doing do

1041
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:05,580
 you think we're creating sort of the next step in our evolution in creating

1042
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,369
 artificial intelligence systems that i don't

1043
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,300
 know i mean you

1044
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,590
 know if there's so much in the universe

1045
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,840
 already it's hard to say

1046
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,990
 well i'm

1047
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:18,990
 standing in his hold are human beings working on additional abstraction layers and possibilities yet appear

1048
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:20,460
 so does

1049
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,130
 that mean that human beings don't need dogs you

1050
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:28,580
 know no like like there's so many things that are all simultaneously

1051
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,580
 interesting

1052
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,119
 and useful but you've seen through i agree you've seen great

1053
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,470
 and greater level abstractions

1054
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,820
 and built in artificial machines

1055
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,690
 right do

1056
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:43,619
 you think when you look at humans you think that the look of all life

1057
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,450
 on earth as a single organism building

1058
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,000
 this thing this machine that greater

1059
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,990
 and greater levels of abstraction do you think humans are the peak

1060
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,530
 the top of the food chain in this long

1061
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,690
 arc of history on earth

1062
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:03,300
 or do you think we're just somewhere in the middle are we are we the basic functional

1063
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,530
 operations of a cpu are we the c++

1064
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:11,790
 program the python perl network like somebody's you

1065
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:12,810
 know people have calculated

1066
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:13,890
 like how many operations

1067
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,930
 does the brain do and something you

1068
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:20,730
 know i've seen the number 10 to the 18th about bunch of times arrive different ways so

1069
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:23,820
 could you make a computer that did 10 to the 20th operations

1070
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,350
 yes sure do

1071
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,960
 you think we're gonna do that now is

1072
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,090
 there something magical about how brains compute things i don't know you

1073
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:34,860
 know my personal experiences

1074
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,990
 interesting cuz you know you think

1075
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,030
 you know how you think and then you have all these ideas and

1076
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,520
 you can't figure out how they happened

1077
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,520
 and

1078
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,940
 if you meditate you know the like

1079
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:47,780
 what what you can be aware of is interesting

1080
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,250
 so i don't know if brains are magical

1081
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:56,990
 or not you know the physical evidence says no lots of people's personal experiences yes

1082
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,990
 so

1083
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:01,170
 what would be funny as if brains are magical

1084
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:04,740
 and yet we can make brains with more computation you

1085
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,170
 know i don't know what to say about that but what

1086
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:09,930
 do you think magic is an emergent phenomena

1087
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,790
 what would be our than me i don't know

1088
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,900
 teller of what what

1089
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,410
 what in your view is consciousness

1090
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,190
 with with consciousness

1091
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:23,360
 yeah like what you know cautiousness

1092
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,740
 love things

1093
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,240
 that are these deeply human things that seems to emerge from our brain is that something

1094
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,170
 that we'll be able to make

1095
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:36,720
 encode in chips that get faster

1096
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,780
 and faster and faster and faster the flick of 10 our conversations

1097
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,570
 no but nobody really knows can you summarize it in a couple of couple of words

1098
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:47,540
 many people have observed that

1099
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:50,730
 organisms run at lots of different levels right

1100
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:56,310
 if you got two neurons somebody said you'd have one sensory neuron and one motor neuron right

1101
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:58,590
 so we move towards things and away from things

1102
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:01,080
 and we have physical integrity and safety

1103
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,520
 or not right

1104
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,420
 and then

1105
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,250
 if you look at the animal kingdom

1106
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,470
 you can see brains that are a little more complicated

1107
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:10,110
 and at some point there's a planning system

1108
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:15,030
 and then there's an emotional system that's you know happy about being safe or unhappy

1109
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:17,040
 about being threatened right

1110
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:23,010
 and then our brains have massive numbers of structures you know like planning

1111
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:24,030
 and movement

1112
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:24,810
 and thinking

1113
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:25,560
 and feeling

1114
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,160
 and drives

1115
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,060
 and emotions

1116
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,300
 and we seem to have multiple layers of thinking systems

1117
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,340
 and we have a brain a dream system that nobody understands whatsoever

1118
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:39,380
 which i find completely hilarious and

1119
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,800
 you can think in a way that those

1120
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,000
 systems are more independent

1121
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,829
 and you can observe you know the different parts of yourself can observe i don't

1122
00:59:49,829 --> 00:59:54,529
 know which one's magical i don't know which ones not computational

1123
00:59:54,529 --> 01:00:00,150
 so is it possible that it's all computation probably is

1124
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:03,239
 there a limit to computation i don't think so do

1125
01:00:03,239 --> 01:00:06,209
 you think the universe is a computer i think

1126
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:08,900
 he seems to be it's a weird kind of computer

1127
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:09,900
 because

1128
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,329
 if it was a computer right

1129
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:14,339
 like when they do calculations

1130
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:20,089
 on what it how much calculation it takes to describe quantum effects is unbelievably high

1131
01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:21,089
 so

1132
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:22,140
 if it was a computer

1133
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,160
 when you built it out of something that was easier to compute right

1134
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,709
 that's that's a funny it's a funny system

1135
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:30,660
 but then the simulation guys

1136
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,640
 have pointed out that the rules are kind of interesting

1137
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,499
 like when you look really close it's uncertain

1138
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:39,089
 and the speed of light says you could only look so far and things can't be simultaneous

1139
01:00:39,089 --> 01:00:41,219
 except for the odd entanglement problem

1140
01:00:41,219 --> 01:00:44,219
 where they seem to be like the rules are all kind of weird

1141
01:00:44,219 --> 01:00:46,380
 and somebody

1142
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:52,199
 said physics is like having 50 equations with 50 variables to define 50 variables like

1143
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:54,689
 you know it's it's you

1144
01:00:54,689 --> 01:00:59,159
 know like physics itself has been a shitshow for thousands of years it

1145
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:03,179
 seems odd when you get to the corners of everything you know it's either uncomputable

1146
01:01:03,179 --> 01:01:05,219
 or on definable

1147
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:07,319
 or uncertain it's

1148
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:12,269
 almost like the designers the simulation are trying to prevent us from understanding it perfectly

1149
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:12,959
 but

1150
01:01:12,959 --> 01:01:16,499
 but also the things that require calculations requires

1151
01:01:16,499 --> 01:01:20,699
 so much calculation that our idea of the universe of a computer is absurd

1152
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:26,429
 because every single little bit of it takes all the computation in the universe to figure out gee

1153
01:01:26,429 --> 01:01:30,359
 that's a weird kind of computer you know you say the simulation is running in the computer

1154
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:35,400
 which has by definition infinite computations not infinite

1155
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,859
 oh you mean if the universe is infinite

1156
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,659
 yeah

1157
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:42,630
 piece of our universe seems to take infinite computation

1158
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:44,400
 i hit you're out just a lot whoa

1159
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,859
 a lot some pretty big number compute this little teeny spot takes all the mass

1160
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:54,839
 in the local one little year by one like your space it's close enough to infinite

1161
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:57,689
 so it's a heck of a computer if it is one i know it's it's

1162
01:01:57,689 --> 01:01:59,939
 it's a weird it's a weird description

1163
01:01:59,939 --> 01:02:05,099
 because the simulations description seems too the break when you look closely at it but

1164
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:08,969
 the rules in universe seemed to imply something's up that

1165
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:14,609
 seems a little arbitrary the whole the universe the whole thing the the laws of physics you

1166
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:16,650
 know it just seems like like

1167
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:19,229
 how did it come out to be yeah

1168
01:02:19,229 --> 01:02:22,890
 the way it is but lots of people talk about that it's you know it's like i

1169
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:27,630
 said the two smartest groups of humans are working on the same problem different different aspects

1170
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,209
 and they're both complete failures

1171
01:02:29,209 --> 01:02:32,249
 so that's kind of cool

1172
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:35,489
 they might succeed eventually well

1173
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:38,430
 after two thousand years the trend isn't good two

1174
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:41,400
 thousand years is nothing in the span of the history of the universe

1175
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,339
 so we have some time but the next thousand years doesn't look good either so that's

1176
01:02:47,339 --> 01:02:49,529
 what everybody says that every stage but with

1177
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:51,390
 moore's law as you've just described

1178
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:53,099
 not being dead the exponential

1179
01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:57,269
 growth the technology the future seems pretty incredible

1180
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:00,569
 well it'll be interesting that's for sure that's right so

1181
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,880
 what are your thoughts on ray

1182
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:10,979
 kurzweil sense that exponential improvement and technology will continue indefinitely that is that how you see moore's law do

1183
01:03:10,979 --> 01:03:12,569
 you see moore's law more broadly

1184
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:18,839
 and since the technology of all kinds has a way of stacking

1185
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:20,479
 s curves on top of each other

1186
01:03:20,479 --> 01:03:23,039
 where it'll be exponential

1187
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,779
 and then we'll see all kinds of what was an exponential of a million mean that's

1188
01:03:27,779 --> 01:03:29,369
 that's a pretty amazing number

1189
01:03:29,369 --> 01:03:31,559
 and that's just for a local little piece of silicon

1190
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:36,650
 now it's imagine you say decided to get a

1191
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:44,519
 thousand tons of silicon to collaborate in one computer at a million times the density like

1192
01:03:44,519 --> 01:03:49,920
 now you know you're talking i don't know 10 to the 20th more computation power then

1193
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,179
 our current already unbelievably fast computers like

1194
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:59,069
 nobody knows what that's going to mean you know the sci-fi guys called you know computron 'i'm like

1195
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:04,890
 when like a local civilization turns the nearby star into a computer i like

1196
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:06,150
 i don't that's true

1197
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:10,069
 but so just even when you shrink a transistor

1198
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:11,699
 the that's

1199
01:04:11,699 --> 01:04:15,960
 only one dimension of the ripple effects of that but people tend to think about computers

1200
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,490
 the cost problem right

1201
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,260
 so computers are made out of silicon

1202
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,089
 and minor amounts of metals

1203
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:23,640
 and you know this

1204
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,060
 and that none of those things cost any money like

1205
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,030
 there's plenty of sand like like

1206
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:33,030
 you could just turn the beach and a little bit ocean water in the computers

1207
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,980
 so all the cost is

1208
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:39,000
 and equipment to do it and the trend on equipment is once

1209
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,770
 you figure out a build the equipment the

1210
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:44,930
 trend of cost is zero elon said first you figure out what

1211
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,790
 configuration you want the atoms in and then

1212
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:49,980
 how to put them there right

1213
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:55,230
 yeah cuz well what here's you know his his great insight is people

1214
01:04:55,230 --> 01:05:00,000
 are how constrained i have this thing i know how it works and then little

1215
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,200
 tweaks to that will generate something as opposed to what do i actually want

1216
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,390
 and then figure out how to build it it's a very different mindset

1217
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:12,020
 and almost nobody has it obviously

1218
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:13,020
 well

1219
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,930
 let me ask on that topic you

1220
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:22,800
 were one of the key early people in the development of autopilot at least in the hardware side elon

1221
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,150
 musk believes that autopilot

1222
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,440
 and vehicle autonomy

1223
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,160
 if you just look at that problem can follow this kind of exponential improvement in

1224
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,050
 terms of the ha the

1225
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:34,020
 how question that we're talking about there's no reason why i can't

1226
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:39,240
 what are your thoughts on this particular space of vehicle autonomy

1227
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:43,230
 and you're a part of it and elon musk's

1228
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:47,880
 and tesla's vision well the computer you need to build was straightforward

1229
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,930
 and you can argue well doesn't need to be 2 times faster

1230
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:53,690
 or 5 times or 10 times

1231
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,910
 but that's just a matter of time

1232
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:56,910
 or

1233
01:05:56,910 --> 01:06:00,330
 price in the short run so that's that's not a big deal you

1234
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:02,450
 don't have to be especially smart to drive a car

1235
01:06:02,450 --> 01:06:05,280
 so it's not like a super hard problem

1236
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,440
 i mean the big problem with safety is attention

1237
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,080
 which computers are really good at not skills

1238
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:16,830
 well let me push back on one you see everything you said it's correct

1239
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:19,790
 but we as humans

1240
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:22,400
 tend to

1241
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,150
 tend to take for granted

1242
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:29,920
 how how incredible our vision system is so you can drive a car of 2050 vision

1243
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,859
 and you can train a neural network to extract

1244
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:37,150
 a distance of any object in the shape of any surface from a video

1245
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:37,799
 and data

1246
01:06:37,799 --> 01:06:44,559
 but that really simple not simple i look that's a simple data problem it's

1247
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,720
 not it's not simple it's

1248
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,670
 because you because it's not just detecting object it's understanding the scene

1249
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,770
 and it's being able to do it in a way that doesn't make errors

1250
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:59,440
 so the beautiful thing about the human vision system

1251
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,650
 and the entire brain around the whole thing is we were able to fill in the gaps it's

1252
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:09,640
 not just about perfectly detecting cars it's inferring the occluded

1253
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,740
 cars it's trying to it's it's understanding

1254
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,530
 the i think it's mostly a bigger problem you

1255
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:20,740
 so you think what data you know with compute with improvement of computation with improvement in collection

1256
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,790
 well there is a you know when

1257
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:24,700
 you're driving a car and somebody cuts you off your brain has theories

1258
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,319
 about why they did it you

1259
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:27,670
 know they're a bad person they're

1260
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,040
 distracted they're dumb you

1261
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,020
 know you can listen to yourself right

1262
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:33,000
 so

1263
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,960
 you know if you

1264
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:40,000
 think that narrative is important to be able to successfully drive a car then current

1265
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,670
 autopilot systems can't do it but if cars

1266
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:48,490
 are ballistic things with tracks and probabilistic changes of speed and direction and roads are fixed

1267
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:52,140
 and given by the way they don't change dynamically

1268
01:07:52,140 --> 01:08:00,210
 right you can map the world really thoroughly you can place every object really thoroughly

1269
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:06,250
 right you can calculate trajectories of things really thoroughly right

1270
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:11,920
 but everything you said about really thoroughly has a different degree of difficulty

1271
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,299
 so you

1272
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:15,549
 could say at some point computer

1273
01:08:15,549 --> 01:08:18,580
 autonomous systems will be way better it's things

1274
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:22,600
 that humans are allows yet like it'll be better at abstention they'll

1275
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,210
 always remember there was a pothole in the road that

1276
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,488
 humans keep forgetting about they'll

1277
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:29,170
 remember that this set of roads

1278
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:34,179
 how these weirdo lines on it the computers figured out once and especially

1279
01:08:34,179 --> 01:08:35,109
 if they get updates

1280
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:40,270
 so if somebody changes a given like that akita robots

1281
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:43,479
 and stuff somebody said is to maximize two givens

1282
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:44,529
 okay right

1283
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:45,340
 so

1284
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,750
 though having a robot

1285
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:47,649
 pick up this bottle

1286
01:08:47,649 --> 01:08:50,100
 cap is ways you put a red dot on the top

1287
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,100
 because

1288
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,529
 then you have to figure out you know if you want to do

1289
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,270
 a certain thing with it you know maximize

1290
01:08:55,270 --> 01:09:02,200
 the givens is the thing and autonomous systems are happily maximizing the givens like humans

1291
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,750
 when you drive someplace new you remember

1292
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,010
 it because you're processing

1293
01:09:06,010 --> 01:09:08,140
 it the whole time and after the 50th time you

1294
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,979
 drove to work you

1295
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:11,350
 get to work you don't know how you got there right

1296
01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:14,250
 you're on autopilot right

1297
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,859
 autonomous cars are always on autopilot

1298
01:09:16,859 --> 01:09:21,399
 but the cars have no theories about why they got cut off or why they're in traffic

1299
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:24,880
 so they'll never stop paying attention right

1300
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:31,390
 so i tend to believe you do have deaf theories mental models of other people especially pedestrians cyclists

1301
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:36,149
 but also with other cars everything you said is

1302
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:41,529
 like is actually essential to driving driving is a lot more complicated than people realize

1303
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:46,300
 i think so sort of to push back slightly but cut into traffic right

1304
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:51,010
 yeah you can't just wait for a gap you have to be somewhat aggressive you'd be surprised

1305
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:54,069
 how simple a calculation for that is i may

1306
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:58,870
 be on that particular point but there's a that it may

1307
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:01,870
 be asked you to push back i would be surprised you know

1308
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,060
 what yeah i'll just say where i stand i would be very surprised

1309
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:07,270
 but i think it's you might be surprised

1310
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:09,430
 how complicated it is that

1311
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:11,950
 i'd say that i tell people's like progress disappoints

1312
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:16,150
 in the short run the surprises in the long run it's very possible yeah i suspect

1313
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:19,150
 in 10 years it'll be just like taken for granted yeah

1314
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:21,400
 but you're probably right

1315
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,180
 now look like it's gonna be a $50 solution that nobody cares about like

1316
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,530
 gps is like wow gps is we have satellites in space that

1317
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:33,220
 tell you where your location is it was a really big deal now everything is the gps i

1318
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:35,950
 mean yeah it's true but i do think that systems

1319
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:39,250
 that involve human behavior are more

1320
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:41,500
 complicated than we give them credit for so we

1321
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,590
 can do incredible things with technology that don't involve humans

1322
01:10:44,590 --> 01:10:48,520
 but when you look humans are less complicated than people you

1323
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:53,560
 know frequently obscure i've maybe i stand off right out of large numbers of patterns

1324
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,280
 and just keep doing it over

1325
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,479
 but i can't trust you because you're a human that's something something

1326
01:10:59,479 --> 01:11:02,449
 a human would say but i might my

1327
01:11:02,449 --> 01:11:06,320
 hope was on the point you've made is even if no

1328
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,440
 matter who is right eve there i'm hoping

1329
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,530
 that there's a lot of things that humans aren't good at that machines

1330
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,269
 are definitely good i like you said attention

1331
01:11:14,269 --> 01:11:16,340
 and things like that well they'll be

1332
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:20,389
 so much better that the overall picture of safety in autonomy

1333
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:24,800
 will be obviously cars will be safer even if they're not as good i'm

1334
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,820
 a big believer in safety

1335
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:28,670
 i mean there are already the current

1336
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:33,440
 safety systems like cruise control that doesn't let you run into people and lane-keeping there

1337
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,670
 are so many features that you just look at the pareto of accidents

1338
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,519
 and knocking off like 80% of them you

1339
01:11:40,519 --> 01:11:44,539
 know super doable just a wing guard on the autopilot team

1340
01:11:44,539 --> 01:11:47,019
 and the efforts there the

1341
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:52,550
 it seems to be that there's a very intense scrutiny by the media

1342
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:57,349
 and the public in terms of safety the pressure the bar but before autonomous vehicles

1343
01:11:57,349 --> 01:12:02,690
 what are your sort of as a person they're working on the hardware

1344
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:05,659
 and trying to build a system that builds a safe vehicle

1345
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:06,050
 and

1346
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:07,340
 so on what

1347
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:12,440
 was your sense about that pressure is it unfair is it expected of new technology it

1348
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,380
 seems reasonable i was interested i talked to both american

1349
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:16,429
 and european regulators

1350
01:12:16,429 --> 01:12:19,269
 and i was worried that

1351
01:12:19,269 --> 01:12:29,139
 the regulations would write into the rules technology solutions like modern brake systems imply hydraulic brakes

1352
01:12:29,139 --> 01:12:30,139
 so

1353
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:35,119
 if you'll read the regulations to meet the letter of the law for brakes it

1354
01:12:35,119 --> 01:12:37,130
 sort of has to be hydraulic right

1355
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:42,139
 and the regulator said there they're interested in the use cases like

1356
01:12:42,139 --> 01:12:45,829
 a head-on crash an offset crash don't hit pedestrians don't

1357
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:48,889
 run into people don't leave the road don't

1358
01:12:48,889 --> 01:12:52,130
 run a red light or a stop light they were very much into the scenarios

1359
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:55,670
 and you know and they had they had all the data about

1360
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:57,229
 which scenarios injured

1361
01:12:57,229 --> 01:12:58,340
 or killed to most people

1362
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:03,829
 and for the most part those conversations were like

1363
01:13:03,829 --> 01:13:06,800
 what's the right thing to do to

1364
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,300
 take the next step

1365
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,930
 now elan is very interested also in the benefits

1366
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:17,680
 of autonomous driving or freeing people's time and attention as well as safety

1367
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,950
 and i think that's also an interesting thing but

1368
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:25,610
 you know building an autonomous system so they're safe and safer

1369
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:29,000
 and people seemed since the goals to be tannic seifer's

1370
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,030
 and people having the bar to be safer than people

1371
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:36,250
 and scrutinizing accidents seems philosophically

1372
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:38,380
 you know correct

1373
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,450
 so i think that's a good thing

1374
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,880
 what r is

1375
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:51,440
 is different than the things you've worked at new intel amd apple with autopilot chip design

1376
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,850
 and hardware design

1377
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,230
 what are interesting

1378
01:13:54,230 --> 01:14:00,440
 or challenging aspects of building this specialized kind of competing system in the automotive space i mean

1379
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,340
 there's two tricks to building like an automotive computer one is to

1380
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:10,130
 software our team the machine learning team is developing algorithms that are changing fast

1381
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:16,010
 so as you're building the the accelerator you have this you know worry

1382
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:22,430
 or intuition that the algorithms will change enough that the accelerator will be the wrong one right

1383
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:27,200
 and there's the generic thing which is if you build a really good general-purpose computers

1384
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,850
 hey it's performance is one

1385
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:35,630
 and then gpu guys will deliver about 5x to performance for the same amount of silicon

1386
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,450
 because instead of discovering parallelism you're given parallelism

1387
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:44,750
 and then special accelerators get another two to five x on top of a gpu

1388
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:48,830
 because you say i know the math is always 8-bit integers

1389
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,630
 and two 32-bit accumulators

1390
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:54,530
 and the operations are the subsets of mathematical possibilities

1391
01:14:54,530 --> 01:15:01,580
 so although you know ai accelerators have a claimed performance benefit over gpus

1392
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:06,500
 because in the narrow math space you're nailing the algorithm

1393
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,260
 now you still try to make it programmable

1394
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:14,690
 but the ai field is changing really fast so there's a you

1395
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:20,090
 know there's little creative tension era of i want the acceleration afforded by specialization

1396
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:22,190
 without being over specialized

1397
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,989
 so that the new algorithm is

1398
01:15:23,989 --> 01:15:27,860
 so much more effective that you'd have been better off on a gpu

1399
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,110
 so there's attention there to

1400
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:34,550
 build a good computer for an application like automotive there's

1401
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:35,960
 all kinds of sensor inputs

1402
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,370
 and safety processors

1403
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:41,350
 and a bunch of stuff so one of loans goal is to make it super affordable

1404
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:44,300
 so every car gets an autopilot computer

1405
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:44,960
 so

1406
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:47,750
 some of the recent startups you look at and they have a server in the trunk

1407
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:51,739
 because they're saying i'm going to build this autopilot computer replaces the driver

1408
01:15:51,739 --> 01:15:54,920
 so their cost budgets ten or twenty thousand dollars

1409
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:00,320
 and eelain's constraint was i'm gonna put one every in every car whether people buy autonomous

1410
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,790
 driving or not so

1411
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:05,150
 the cost constraint he had in mind was great right

1412
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:06,980
 and to hit that you

1413
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,199
 had to think about the system design that's complicated it's

1414
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,870
 it's fun you know it's like it's like it's craftsmen's

1415
01:16:11,870 --> 01:16:13,460
 work like a violin

1416
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:17,989
 maker right you could say stradivarius is this incredible thing the musicians are incredible

1417
01:16:17,989 --> 01:16:19,910
 but the guy making the violin

1418
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:24,080
 you know picked wood and sanded it and then he cut it you

1419
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,260
 know and he glued it and you know and he waited for the right day

1420
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,040
 so

1421
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,930
 that when you put the finish on it didn't

1422
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:33,320
 you know do something dumb that's craftsmen's work right

1423
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,239
 you may be a genius craftsman

1424
01:16:35,239 --> 01:16:36,680
 because you have the best techniques

1425
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:37,989
 and you discover a new one

1426
01:16:37,989 --> 01:16:45,440
 but most engineers craftsmen's work and humans really like to do that you know smart humans

1427
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,489
 oh no everybody

1428
01:16:46,489 --> 01:16:47,360
 oh i

1429
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,210
 know i used to i dug ditches when i was in college

1430
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,890
 i got really good at it satisfying

1431
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:52,670
 yeah

1432
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:55,370
 so digging ditches is also craft malware

1433
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:56,570
 yeah of course

1434
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:57,080
 so

1435
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:00,199
 so there's an expression called complex mastery behavior

1436
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:04,219
 so when you're learning something that's fun because you're learning something when

1437
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,560
 you do something that's wrote and simple it's not that satisfying

1438
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,760
 but if the steps that you have to do or complicate it and you're

1439
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,840
 good at them it's satisfying to do them and then

1440
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,610
 if you're intrigued by it all as you're doing them you sometimes learn new things that

1441
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:20,710
 you can raise your game

1442
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:26,660
 but christmas work is good in engineers like engineering is complicated

1443
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:28,880
 enough that you have to learn a lot of skills and

1444
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,610
 then a lot of what you do is then craftsmen's

1445
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:33,890
 work which is fun autonomous

1446
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:36,019
 driving building a very

1447
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:37,789
 a resource-constrained computer

1448
01:17:37,789 --> 01:17:41,239
 so computer has to be cheap enough that put in every single car that's

1449
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,599
 essentially boils down to

1450
01:17:43,599 --> 01:17:46,190
 craftsmen's work it's saying genius

1451
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:47,539
 so there's thoughtful decisions

1452
01:17:47,539 --> 01:17:50,090
 and problems to solve and trade-offs

1453
01:17:50,090 --> 01:17:53,329
 to make do you need 10 cameron ports or 8 you know you're

1454
01:17:53,329 --> 01:17:56,090
 building for the current car or the next one you

1455
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:57,679
 know how do you do the safety stuff

1456
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,739
 you know there's there's a whole bunch of details

1457
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:04,610
 but it's fun but it's not like i'm building a new type and they're all networked

1458
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:05,960
 which has a new mathematics

1459
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,059
 and a new computer at work do

1460
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:11,530
 you know that that's like there's a there's more invention than that

1461
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:15,949
 but the rejection to practice once you picked the architecture you look inside

1462
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:17,420
 and what do you see adders

1463
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:18,139
 and multipliers

1464
01:18:18,139 --> 01:18:19,099
 and memories

1465
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:20,869
 and you know the basics

1466
01:18:20,869 --> 01:18:26,389
 so computers is always just this weird set of abstraction layers of ideas

1467
01:18:26,389 --> 01:18:30,320
 and thinking that reduction to practice is transistors

1468
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,199
 and wires and you know pretty basic stuff

1469
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:35,090
 and that's

1470
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:37,159
 an interesting phenomena by

1471
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:38,900
 the way that like factory work like

1472
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:42,590
 lots of people think factory work is road assembly stuff i've

1473
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:44,360
 been on the assembly line like

1474
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,929
 the people work that really liked it it's a really great job it's

1475
01:18:47,929 --> 01:18:50,749
 really complicated putting cars together is hard right

1476
01:18:50,749 --> 01:18:52,099
 and in the cars moving

1477
01:18:52,099 --> 01:18:54,800
 and the parts are moving and sometimes the parts are damaged

1478
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,539
 and you have to coordinate putting

1479
01:18:56,539 --> 01:18:59,150
 all the stuff together and people are good at it they're

1480
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:02,449
 good at it and i remember one day i went to work and the

1481
01:19:02,449 --> 01:19:04,550
 line was shut down for some reason and then

1482
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:08,389
 some of the guys sitting around were really bummed because they they had reorganized

1483
01:19:08,389 --> 01:19:09,079
 a bunch of stuff

1484
01:19:09,079 --> 01:19:10,190
 and they were gonna hit a new

1485
01:19:10,190 --> 01:19:11,630
 record for the number of cars built

1486
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,980
 that day and they

1487
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:15,440
 were all gung ho to do it and these were big tough buggers

1488
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,869
 yeah you know but

1489
01:19:17,869 --> 01:19:19,039
 what they did was complicated

1490
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,030
 and you couldn't do it

1491
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:20,389
 yeah

1492
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:20,690
 and

1493
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:21,559
 i mean well

1494
01:19:21,559 --> 01:19:22,039
 after

1495
01:19:22,039 --> 01:19:25,880
 a while you could but you'd have to work your way up cuz you know like

1496
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:27,499
 putting a bright what's

1497
01:19:27,499 --> 01:19:32,780
 called the bright stuff at the trim on a car on a moving assembly line where

1498
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,039
 it has to be attached 25

1499
01:19:34,039 --> 01:19:37,719
 places in a minute and a half is unbelievably complicated

1500
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:38,739
 and

1501
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:39,739
 and

1502
01:19:39,739 --> 01:19:42,710
 and human beings can do it's really good i think

1503
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:45,469
 that's harder than driving a car by the way putting

1504
01:19:45,469 --> 01:19:49,850
 together working working on the factory to smart

1505
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:50,750
 people can disagree

1506
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:54,860
 yeah i think drive driving a car will

1507
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:56,780
 get you in the factory something will

1508
01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:02,000
 see you're not for us humans driving a car is easy i'm saying building a machine that

1509
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,370
 drives a car is not easy ok ok driving a car is easy for humans

1510
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:11,360
 because we've been evolving for billions of years drive cars

1511
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:16,730
 yeah no juice the pail if the cars are super cool no

1512
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:22,060
 now you join the rest of the internet and mocking me ok

1513
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,060
 yeah

1514
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:26,050
 yeah intrigued by your you know your anthropology

1515
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:30,200
 yeah it says we have to go dig into that there's some inaccuracies there

1516
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,400
 yes ok

1517
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:34,540
 but in general

1518
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:42,130
 what have you learned in terms of thinking about passion

1519
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:43,600
 craftsmanship

1520
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,120
 tension chaos

1521
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:50,030
 you know the whole mess of it

1522
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:50,960
 or

1523
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,940
 what have you learned have

1524
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,430
 taken away from your time working with elon

1525
01:20:55,430 --> 01:21:02,380
 musk working at tesla which is known to be a place of chaos innovation

1526
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:03,380
 craftsmanship

1527
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:07,790
 and i really like the way he thought like you think you have an understanding about

1528
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:12,440
 what first principles of something is and then you talk to you alone about it and you you

1529
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,870
 didn't scratch the surface you

1530
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,540
 know he has a deep belief that

1531
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:21,020
 no matter what you do is a local maximum right

1532
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:24,920
 i had a friend he invented a better electric motor and it

1533
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,080
 was like a lot better than what we were using and

1534
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,090
 one day he came by he said you know i'm

1535
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:30,290
 a little disappointed cuz

1536
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:34,790
 you know this is really great and you didn't seem that impressed and i said you

1537
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:39,020
 know and the super intelligent aliens come are they gonna be looking for you like

1538
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:41,140
 where is he the guy you built the motor

1539
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:45,680
 yeah probably not you know like like the

1540
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:49,340
 but doing interesting work that's both innovative

1541
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:54,260
 and let's say craftsmen's work on the current thing it's really satisfying it's good and

1542
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,290
 and that's cool and then

1543
01:21:56,290 --> 01:22:00,920
 elon was good taking everything apart and like what's the deep first principle

1544
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,150
 oh no

1545
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:05,360
 what's really what's really you know you know you

1546
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:09,260
 know that that you know ability to look at it without assumptions

1547
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:09,590
 and

1548
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:10,580
 and

1549
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,330
 how constraints is super wild you

1550
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,940
 know we build rocket ship and using

1551
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,120
 the same car you know everything

1552
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,760
 and that's super fun and he's into it too like when

1553
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,239
 they first landed to spacex rockets at tesla we

1554
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:28,610
 had a video projector in the big room and like five

1555
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:31,190
 hundred people came down and when they landed everybody cheered

1556
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:34,940
 and some people cried it was so cool alright

1557
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,420
 but how did you do that well

1558
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:38,420
 it

1559
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,760
 was super hard and then

1560
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,130
 people say well it's chaotic really to

1561
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,320
 get out of all your assumptions you think that's not going to be unbelievably painful

1562
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,310
 and there's

1563
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:56,210
 elon tough yeah probably the people look back on it and say boy i'm really happy

1564
01:22:56,210 --> 01:22:59,179
 i had that experience to go take

1565
01:22:59,179 --> 01:23:02,290
 apart that many layers of assumptions

1566
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:04,760
 sometimes super fun sometimes painful

1567
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:06,440
 so it could be emotionally

1568
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:10,130
 and intellectually painful that whole process just stripping away assumptions

1569
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:15,140
 yeah i imagine 99% of your thought process is protecting your self conception

1570
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,910
 and 98% of that's wrong

1571
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:19,910
 yeah

1572
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:22,699
 now you got there math right no

1573
01:23:22,699 --> 01:23:25,969
 you think your feeling when you get back into that one bit that's useful

1574
01:23:25,969 --> 01:23:26,360
 and

1575
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:27,679
 now you're open

1576
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,750
 and you have the ability to do something different i don't

1577
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:38,260
 know if i got the math right it might be ninety nine point nine but in 850

1578
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:43,300
 imagining it the 50% is hard enough yeah

1579
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:48,560
 now for a long time i've suspected you could get better look

1580
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:53,179
 you can think better you can think more clearly you can take things apart and there's

1581
01:23:53,179 --> 01:23:57,489
 lots of examples of that people who do that

1582
01:23:57,489 --> 01:24:01,310
 so any line is an example of that parent

1583
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:04,550
 or an example says you know if i am i'm

1584
01:24:04,550 --> 01:24:06,980
 fun to talk to certainly

1585
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,810
 i've learned a lot of stuff right

1586
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:13,070
 well here's the other thing it's like i talk like like i read books and

1587
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:16,610
 people think oh you read books well no i brought a couple books

1588
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:23,630
 awake for 55 years well maybe 50 cuz i didn't read learned read tall as h or something

1589
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,390
 and

1590
01:24:25,390 --> 01:24:27,230
 and it

1591
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,810
 turns out when people write books they often take

1592
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:32,240
 20 years of their life where they passionately

1593
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:36,170
 did something reduce it to to 200 pages that's

1594
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:37,790
 kind of fun and then

1595
01:24:37,790 --> 01:24:39,680
 the goat you go online and you can find out

1596
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:43,340
 who wrote the best books and who like you know that's kind of alda

1597
01:24:43,340 --> 01:24:45,140
 so there's this wild selection process

1598
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:48,940
 and then you can read it and for the most part to understand it

1599
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:52,040
 and then you can go apply it like

1600
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:54,560
 i went to one company and i thought i haven't managed much before

1601
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:59,330
 so i read 20 management books and i started talking to him basically

1602
01:24:59,330 --> 01:25:01,550
 compared to all the vp's running around i'd

1603
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:03,230
 run night read 19

1604
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:06,220
 more management books than anybody else

1605
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,120
 was it even that hard

1606
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:08,540
 yeah

1607
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:13,760
 and a half the stuff worked like first time it wasn't even rocket science but at

1608
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,520
 the core of that is questioning the assumptions

1609
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,580
 okay sort of entering

1610
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,320
 the thinking first principles

1611
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:26,840
 thinking sort of looking at the reality of the situation and using it using

1612
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:28,340
 that knowledge applying that knowledge so

1613
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:33,920
 mean yes so i would say my brain has this idea that you can question first assumptions

1614
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:34,450
 and

1615
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:36,380
 but i can

1616
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,390
 go days at a time and forget that and

1617
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:41,830
 you have to kind of like circle back data observation

1618
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:46,760
 because it is because part allen gene well it's hard to keep it front

1619
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,210
 and center

1620
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:51,320
 because you know you're you operate on so many levels all the time and you

1621
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:53,360
 know getting this done takes priority

1622
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,070
 or you know being

1623
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:58,430
 happy takes priority or you know screwing

1624
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,560
 around takes priority like like like

1625
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,270
 how you go through life it's complicated

1626
01:26:02,270 --> 01:26:02,780
 yeah

1627
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:03,860
 and then you remember

1628
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,350
 oh yeah i could really i think first principles

1629
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:08,900
 so much that's that's tiring you

1630
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,890
 know what you do for a while that's kind of cool

1631
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:12,890
 so

1632
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:16,370
 just as the last question your sense from

1633
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:19,670
 the big picture from the first principles do

1634
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,230
 you think you kind of answered already

1635
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:28,580
 but do you think autonomous driving something we can solve on a timeline of years

1636
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:35,640
 so one two three five ten years as opposed to a century yeah definitely just

1637
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:39,660
 to linger and a little longer where's the confidence coming

1638
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:44,820
 from is it the fundamentals of the problem the fundamentals of building a hardware

1639
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:49,400
 and the software as a computational problem understanding

1640
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:53,360
 ballistics roles topography

1641
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,530
 it seems pretty solvable

1642
01:26:55,530 --> 01:26:56,700
 i mean

1643
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,490
 and you can see this you know like like speech recognition

1644
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:01,650
 for a long time people are doing you know frequency

1645
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:02,610
 and domain analysis

1646
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:06,240
 and and all kinds of stuff and that didn't work for at all right

1647
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:13,250
 and then they did deep learning about it and it worked great and it took multiple iterations

1648
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,410
 and

1649
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:16,410
 you

1650
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:20,790
 know time is driving his way past the frequency analysis point you

1651
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:22,940
 know use radar don't run into things

1652
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:26,190
 and the data gathering is going up in the computations

1653
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:29,220
 going up and the algorithm understanding is going up and there's

1654
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,690
 a whole bunch of problems getting solved

1655
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:35,160
 like that the data side is really powerful but i disagree with both you

1656
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:39,420
 and you and i'll tell you and once again as i did before that that

1657
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:42,960
 when you add human beings into the picture the

1658
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:47,160
 it's no longer a ballistics problem it's something more complicated

1659
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:48,570
 but i could

1660
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:50,070
 be very well proven

1661
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:54,030
 cars are hardly damped in terms are ready to change like

1662
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:58,800
 the steering and the steering systems really slow compared to a computer the acceleration

1663
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:00,230
 of the acceleration is really slow

1664
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:01,740
 yeah on

1665
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:03,570
 a certain time scale on a ballistics

1666
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,730
 time scale but human behavior i don't know it

1667
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:06,660
 yeah

1668
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,200
 i shouldn't say it beans are really slow to weed weirdly

1669
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,160
 we operate you know half a second behind reality nobody

1670
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,050
 really understands that one either it's pretty funny

1671
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:16,790
 yeah

1672
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:17,790
 yeah

1673
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,040
 so no

1674
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,590
 i will be with very well could be surprised

1675
01:28:22,590 --> 01:28:23,790
 and i

1676
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:28,440
 think with the rate of improvement in all aspects i'm both the computed in the the the software

1677
01:28:28,440 --> 01:28:34,100
 and the hardware there's gonna be pleasant surprises all over the place

1678
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:41,280
 speaking of unpleasant surprises many people have worries about a singularity in the development of ai

1679
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,370
 forgive me for such questions you know what

1680
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:46,020
 when ai improves exponentially

1681
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:51,150
 and reaches a point of superhuman level general intelligence you

1682
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:53,490
 know beyond the point there's no looking back do

1683
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:58,350
 you share this worry of existential threats from artificial intelligence from computers

1684
01:28:58,350 --> 01:29:01,070
 becoming superhuman level intelligent

1685
01:29:01,070 --> 01:29:03,630
 no not really you

1686
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,840
 know like we already have a very stratified society

1687
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:07,830
 and then

1688
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:10,290
 if you look at the whole animal kingdom of capabilities

1689
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,520
 and abilities and interests

1690
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,860
 and you

1691
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:18,900
 know smart people have their niche and you know normal people have their niche and craftsmen's

1692
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:21,030
 have their niche and you know

1693
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:23,490
 animals have their niche i suspect

1694
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:28,410
 that the domains of interest for things that you know astronomically

1695
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:31,020
 different like the whole something

1696
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,830
 got 10 times smarter than us and wanted to track us all down because what we

1697
01:29:34,830 --> 01:29:37,110
 like to have coffee at starbucks like

1698
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:41,610
 it doesn't seem plausible no is there an existential problem that how

1699
01:29:41,610 --> 01:29:44,520
 do you live in a world where there's something way smarter than you and you

1700
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,610
 you based your kind of self-esteem on being

1701
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:52,620
 the smartest local person well there's what 0.1% of the population who thinks that because

1702
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,880
 the rest of the populations been dealing with it since they were born

1703
01:29:55,880 --> 01:30:06,080
 so the the breadth of possible experience that can be interesting is really big and

1704
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:13,370
 you know super intelligence seems likely although we still don't know if we're magical

1705
01:30:13,370 --> 01:30:15,440
 but i suspect we're not

1706
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:21,390
 and it seems likely that'll create possibilities that are interesting for us and it's

1707
01:30:21,390 --> 01:30:27,000
 its interests will be interesting for that for whatever it is it's

1708
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,820
 not obvious why it's interest would somehow

1709
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:34,620
 want to fight over some square foot of dirt or you know whatever

1710
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,510
 then you know the usual fears

1711
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:42,570
 are about so you don't think you'll inherit some of the darker aspects of human nature depends

1712
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:44,580
 on how you think reality is constructed

1713
01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:48,360
 so for for whatever reasons human

1714
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:54,429
 beings are and that's a creative tension in opposition with both are good and bad

1715
01:30:54,429 --> 01:30:58,800
 forces like there's lots of philosophical understandings of that

1716
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,340
 right i don't know why that would be different

1717
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,340
 so

1718
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:09,010
 you think the evils is necessary for the good i mean the tension i don't know about evil

1719
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:11,380
 but like we live in a competitive world

1720
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:16,749
 where your good is somebody else's you know evil you

1721
01:31:16,749 --> 01:31:21,630
 know there's there's the malignant part of it but that seems to be

1722
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:26,579
 self-limiting although occasionally it's it's super horrible

1723
01:31:26,579 --> 01:31:27,579
 but

1724
01:31:27,579 --> 01:31:29,679
 yeah look there's a debate over ideas

1725
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:32,169
 and some people have different beliefs

1726
01:31:32,169 --> 01:31:34,419
 and that that debate itself is a process

1727
01:31:34,419 --> 01:31:38,919
 so the at arriving at something you know i wouldn't continue

1728
01:31:38,919 --> 01:31:39,989
 yeah

1729
01:31:39,989 --> 01:31:41,320
 just you

1730
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:47,889
 but you don't think that whole process will leave humans behind in a way that's painful an emotionally

1731
01:31:47,889 --> 01:31:52,300
 painful yes for the one for the point one percent they'll be there why isn't it already painful

1732
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:54,219
 for a large percentage of the population and

1733
01:31:54,219 --> 01:31:57,969
 it is i mean society does have a lot of stress in it about

1734
01:31:57,969 --> 01:32:02,650
 the 1% and the bath of this and about to that but you know everybody

1735
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,110
 has a lot of stress in their life about what they find satisfying

1736
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,489
 and

1737
01:32:05,489 --> 01:32:09,579
 and you know know yourself seems to be the proper dictum

1738
01:32:09,579 --> 01:32:15,239
 and pursue something that makes your life meaningful seems proper

1739
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:16,630
 and there's

1740
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:19,599
 so many avenues on that like there's

1741
01:32:19,599 --> 01:32:23,369
 so much unexplored space at every single level

1742
01:32:23,369 --> 01:32:31,619
 you know i'm somewhat of my nephew called me a jaded optimist you

1743
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:32,619
 know

1744
01:32:32,619 --> 01:32:36,449
 so it's there's a beautiful tension that in that label

1745
01:32:36,449 --> 01:32:37,449
 but

1746
01:32:37,449 --> 01:32:38,860
 if you

1747
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:41,400
 were to look back at your life and

1748
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:45,280
 could relive a moment a set of moments

1749
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:50,729
 because there were the happiest times in your life outside of family

1750
01:32:50,729 --> 01:32:53,820
 what would that be i

1751
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:59,289
 don't want to relive any moments i like that i like that situation

1752
01:32:59,289 --> 01:33:01,269
 where you have some amount of optimism

1753
01:33:01,269 --> 01:33:05,440
 and then the anxiety of the unknown

1754
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:06,440
 so

1755
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,960
 you love the unknown do you the

1756
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:13,210
 mystery of it i don't know about the mystery it sure gets your blood pumping

1757
01:33:13,210 --> 01:33:14,210
 what

1758
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:21,800
 do you think is the meaning of this whole thing of life on this pale blue dot it

1759
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,460
 seems to be what it does

1760
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:28,480
 like the universe for whatever reason

1761
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,050
 makes atoms

1762
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:30,950
 which makes us

1763
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:33,460
 which we do stuff

1764
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:35,420
 and we figure out things

1765
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:36,710
 and we explore things

1766
01:33:36,710 --> 01:33:40,780
 and that's just what it is it's not just

1767
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:43,970
 yeah it is you

1768
01:33:43,970 --> 01:33:47,810
 know jim i don't think there's a better place to end it it's a huge honor
