1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:00,560
so,

2
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,760
 i don't know if you know, but i

3
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,160
 i was on a twitter spaces with you like four months ago,

4
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,879
 and we were we were talking about micro strategy, and it was pretty cool.

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,080
 we were just talking about your thoughts on bitcoin,

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,240
 but

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:08,559
 i've been i've

8
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:08,880
 been a fan

9
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,200
 for a while,

10
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:09,360
 and

11
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,519
 i'm,

12
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:09,679
 you

13
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:09,920
 know, happy

14
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,080
 you're

15
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,240
 joining

16
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,559
 the stream.

17
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,040
 awesome, man.

18
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,200
 yeah.

19
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,440
 thanks.

20
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,880
 nice to hook up with you.

21
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,200
 all right.

22
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,480
 so, bunch of how much time?

23
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,639
 what?

24
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:14,960
 30 minutes?

25
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,440
 you got 30 minutes?

26
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,000
 whatever you want.

27
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,720
 yeah.

28
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,440
 okay, cool.

29
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,080
 here we go.

30
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,840
 uh, first of all, big fan of goodell.

31
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
 i actually paid for it, so oh, thank you.

32
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,080
 great.

33
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,400
 yeah.

34
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
 i i got into that $60 a month tier a while ago.

35
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
 now i have to be nice to you.

36
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,000
 now you have to be nice to me.

37
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,160
 good.

38
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,400
 i i have your bloomberg competitor right here.

39
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,320
 i i can't i i can't i can't say anything nasty at this point.

40
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,640
 you're a customer, so i i work for you.

41
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,440
 there we go.

42
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,000
 um

43
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,320
 okay,

44
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,640
 so

45
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,200
 my audience

46
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,440
 has really been interested in your thoughts in a variety of different areas.

47
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,280
 pounder, nvidia, bitcoin, quantum.

48
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
 so i think we can take those one by one, but

49
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,440
 i think we'll start off with the elephant in the room.

50
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
 everyone has been wondering

51
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
 why you are short quantum

52
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,160
 and how quantum is going up four 5x.

53
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,879
 is it just retail hype momentum or do you

54
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,840
 the guy who has done pretty well for himself in life in terms of managing money

55
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
 not understand the quantum thesis?

56
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,480
 so i'll just lay it out there.

57
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,680
 are you right or are the shorts going to get burned on quantum?

58
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,000
 yeah.

59
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,320
 so i mean i think this is going to be one of the biggest

60
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
 trades in my in my career.

61
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 i think that

62
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 um

63
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,479
 and and my career is is not as you know is it's it's not in trading.

64
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,439
 my career is in in being an entrepreneur.

65
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,400
 i built drug companies.

66
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
 i'm building a software company now.

67
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,560
 so, it's not really one of these things where i,

68
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
 you know, have wanted to or or i'm going to,

69
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,439
 you know, be a hedge fund manager.

70
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
 i've never really wanted to do that.

71
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,479
 and,

72
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,840
 um, you know, nevertheless, i find myself compelled

73
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,479
 because this is this is one of the craziest things i've ever seen.

74
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,759
 it it's, uh, you know, there really hasn't been anything like this.

75
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,759
 i don't know if ever is the right term,

76
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,960
 but it's it's it's

77
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
 really a remarkable thing that's going on in the market.

78
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
 and it's it's it's wrapping a lot of

79
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,280
 people who are new to the market into it.

80
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
 and i think it's it's,

81
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,479
 you know, there's there's something like this happens, you know, every few years.

82
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,360
 we had the cannabis rally, we had nftts,

83
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,360
 we had, you know, 3d printing,

84
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,560
 we had there's a lot of little mini bubbles, but this one's pretty preposterous.

85
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,160
 i mean, 3d printing could have been a thing.

86
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,679
 cannabis could have been a thing,

87
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,440
 you know, and you just have to sort of wait and see.

88
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,560
 and then when all the cannabis companies reported earnings, they were really bad.

89
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
 gross margins were negative.

90
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
 you can't build a business on negative gross margins.

91
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,879
 and

92
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,680
 um you know, you sort of watch and and kind of like decide that okay,

93
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,959
 you know,

94
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,319
 this is a cool and exciting idea, but the business just isn't there.

95
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,440
 quantum is sort of like that.

96
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,840
 there's just no possible way that these companies could be successful.

97
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
 um my girlfriend, there's no way they could be successful.

98
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:36,959
 no way.

99
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,200
 yeah.

100
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,959
 so, so my girlfriend's a,

101
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,440
 you know, we're

102
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,319
 a lot of people are experts

103
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:40,879
 and we we

104
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,920
 talk to all the same experts

105
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,640
 everyone else does.

106
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,120
 you know, all the big names in the field,

107
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,000
 but the big names in the field are telling you that it's not possible.

108
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,080
 scott aronson, again, my girlfriend worked with him at mit and at openai.

109
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,599
 and in essence, you know, scott just doesn't believe that quantum's coming anytime soon.

110
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,720
 worse than that, there's four quantum stocks.

111
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,360
 regetti, d-wave, ion q, and quantum computing inc., correct?

112
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,519
 two of those are frauds.

113
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
 so, ion q and regetti are actually trying to build a quantum computer.

114
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
 now, i think that's 30 years away.

115
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,599
 even if you do build it, there's nothing there.

116
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,120
 but d-wave and quantum computing inc., in my opinion,

117
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,159
 you know, and i know other people disagree,

118
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,879
 they are complete scams.

119
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,959
 so d-wave has been around 20 years.

120
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,720
 they've never they made six computers, six generations of their computers.

121
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,680
 they've never worked.

122
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,599
 you can't find a customer who says they work.

123
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,560
 you can't find a customer who

124
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
 actually

125
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
 uses the machines in production in software we call production

126
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,239
 live setting, the real deal.

127
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,440
 not just, you know, trying it out, see if this thing could work someday,

128
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
 but actually like

129
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,799
 no, this is a part of our business,

130
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,040
 right?

131
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,519
 no one, not a single one that i'm aware of.

132
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,159
 and again, if the company could could show one,

133
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,080
 i i i challenge them to do so.

134
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,319
 but, you know, so i'm shorting these stocks.

135
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,159
 qci was a beverage company.

136
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,159
 they're under investigation by the sec.

137
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,760
 not that i love the sec,

138
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
 but you know, i think that,

139
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,920
 you know, this is a company that basically didn't exist before.

140
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,680
 they had $30,000 of revenue last quarter.

141
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,079
 30,000. you know, your stream and my stream do more than that.

142
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,079
 and i think that, you know, for this to be a two billion dollar

143
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,919
 publicly traded company

144
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,800
 that has a, you know, a quantum is is just silly.

145
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,600
 again,

146
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,440
 why in your in your professional opinion,

147
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
 how did we get to two billion off 30,000

148
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,160
 in revenue?

149
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
 liquidity.

150
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,360
 so, it's it's it's liquidity.

151
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,320
 i i love you, your stream, your viewers.

152
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,759
 i love my viewers.

153
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,040
 not all of our viewers are the sharpest tools in the shed.

154
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,280
 there are a few of amongst us who are not great at investing.

155
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,560
 you're you're excited,

156
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,479
 you want to buy the next nvidia,

157
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,199
 so do i, but you have to look through thousands of stocks to find the one

158
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:55,919
 gem.

159
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,280
 and that's not what people do.

160
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,160
 people are lazy.

161
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,680
 they they don't want to do that.

162
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
 they want to read reddit.

163
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
 they want to watch a youtube.

164
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,400
 they see one thing that sounds exciting.

165
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,680
 oh, that sounds like the future.

166
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
 i'm going to buy that.

167
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
 and you know, that's typically what happens.

168
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,320
 nftts were the same way.

169
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,360
 cannabis was the same way.

170
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
 how could you deny the sexiness of cannabis?

171
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,840
 you got a hundred-y old tobacco industry in the us, hundred billion dollar companies,

172
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,120
 and now you have weed.

173
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
 oh my god, this is going to be huge.

174
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,400
 well, it turns out the business fundamentals just weren't that good.

175
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,560
 and the till raise went down 95%, aurora cannabis down 95%,

176
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
 etc. and the reality just hits you sometimes.

177
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,280
 and we all want to buy growth stocks.

178
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,320
 we all want to buy exciting stocks that could be the future.

179
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
 but you also have to do do your homework.

180
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,960
 and and you know the ceo of ionq, former ceo and founder

181
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
 had this very esoteric podcast

182
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,720
 a physics podcast.

183
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,160
 i thought he was tweeting about it yesterday.

184
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,479
 yeah.

185
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,000
 629 nanometer.

186
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,759
 it's it's like the nerdiest thing you can imagine, but this is where you find alpha.

187
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,320
 and he went on there and he said quantum computing is not going to be around

188
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,080
 for another 30 years and

189
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,199
 there's no application.

190
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,320
 we don't know what they're good for literally.

191
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,000
 and even nsa.

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,199
 so, the one thing i can see in quantum is that they would be extremely

193
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,199
 good for

194
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,600
 for

195
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
 hacking and and encryption

196
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,080
 breaking, you know, and this is like a hobby of mine on the side,

197
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
 specifically with bitcoin.

198
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,240
 and so, i've played with quantum computers.

199
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
 i've bought every single commercial quantum computer.

200
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
 i'm a major user of their cloud cloud time.

201
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,720
 spent thousands of dollars of my own money on quantum computing.

202
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
 and i can tell you these machines don't work.

203
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
 you know, they they can't factor

204
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
 even the number like a million,

205
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
 which a child could factor

206
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,319
 with a pen and paper,

207
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,479
 right?

208
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,000
 these quantum computers can't do that.

209
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,400
 and it doesn't look like, oh, we're just around the corner.

210
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
 we're going to get a breakthrough.

211
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,319
 in fact, if anything, it looks like we may be at a log jam.

212
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,080
 now, technology does progress.

213
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
 and sometimes you get these discontinuous

214
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
 jumps where it's like, oh, wow, okay, it didn't work before.

215
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
 it didn't work before.

216
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,319
 and all of a sudden, boom, it works.

217
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,360
 kind of like ai.

218
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
 but the problem is, what are we going for?

219
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,600
 what is it that we're going to do when the magic machine shows up?

220
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,000
 and nobody can answer this question.

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,639
 and factoring numbers is fun.

222
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,840
 i like doing it.

223
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,440
 but the only thing it's good for is encryption.

224
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
 we've already have postquantum encryption.

225
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,599
 in fact, the this the former the guy whose name is chris monroe.

226
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,400
 he's a genius.

227
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
 he's an idol of mine.

228
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:13,919
 yep.

229
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
 he's probably going to win the nobel prize.

230
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,199
 chris said that even the nsa doesn't want a quantum computer, which shocked me actually.

231
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,360
 that's way more bearish than i ever was.

232
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
 um he said that they just want to know when quantum

233
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,319
 quantum computers are coming so they could prepare for it.

234
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
 and i thought that was fascinating

235
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
 because a lot of people think the nsa has a quantum computer or they're they're they're

236
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,039
 really interested in it.

237
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,440
 but that impression from the from the founder of ionq was really surprising to me.

238
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
 i i i wouldn't have characterized it that way.

239
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,120
 and again, he's sort of explaining that even the big companies like google and ibm

240
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
 don't have quantum computers that will work.

241
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
 he thinks they're wasting their money.

242
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,639
 i i want to talk about google and ibm, but here's the question.

243
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
 if you were the biggest quantum bull on the planet,

244
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,479
 what is the use case that you are the most excited about because of quantum?

245
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,800
 i think it's people who are these people are confused.

246
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,280
 they they don't understand what these computers can or can't do.

247
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,720
 so, if you think about computing in general, nvidia is the biggest computing company, right?

248
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
 and xai,

249
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,800
 openai,

250
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
 these are the companies that buy these machines

251
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,680
 and they want to train

252
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,000
 models

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
 and run inference.

254
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
 these are hard to do computationally, right?

255
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
 quantum could never do those.

256
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,560
 it can't do those.

257
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,960
 why?

258
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,479
 there's no memory.

259
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,160
 there's no ram.

260
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
 there's no way to load the data into the machine.

261
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,080
 the machine has 100 cubits.

262
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,120
 you could you could how much can you can store your name

263
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,919
 in 100 cubits maybe, but you can't store the corpus of the internet at 100 cubits.

264
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,039
 it doesn't do that.

265
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,240
 i think there's this confusion that like these are normal computers.

266
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
 you can the the lady i just watched this interview with john presc.

267
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 prescll is one of the fathers of quantum computing.

268
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,560
 worked with richard fineman at caltech.

269
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
 he who invented quantum computers, the idea of them at least.

270
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,160
 prescll said the interview said, "prescll, can can this make me post on instagram faster?"

271
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,680
 and this is like this is not what these machines do.

272
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,240
 these are scientific machines and the only people really interested in them are scientists.

273
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,959
 you know,

274
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,680
 if you had to come up with a use case that is uber bullish,

275
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,720
 what would it be?

276
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,519
 i mean, there is this idea that you could and listen, i have a vivid imagination.

277
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,959
 you know, i can i can try to come up with one

278
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,399
 and the best i could give you maybe would be

279
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,080
 simulating physics.

280
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,320
 so like a really good physics engine.

281
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,080
 but this gets back to the to to one really interesting point that jensen wong said.

282
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,279
 he said

283
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,720
 he had the 10 quantum ceos up on the stage and he said

284
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
 we don't need a better solution to the traveling salesman problem.

285
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,760
 so anybody who knows computing in the house

286
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
 knows is the np hard problem that traditional computers struggle with.

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,320
 you cannot if i give you 70 cities to,

288
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,399
 you know, 70 blocks of a city

289
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
 where you have to drop off, you know, mail

290
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
 all 70 blocks.

291
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,240
 what is the optimal route?

292
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,519
 that's a really hard question.

293
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,360
 combinatorally, it kind of explodes on you.

294
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,320
 it's like two to the 70th power or something crazy like that.

295
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,440
 but what's funny is that a regular old computer,

296
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
 a stupid ass laptop can do this equation

297
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,920
 close enough.

298
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,680
 it gets like a 99% approximate of the perfect answer.

299
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,079
 and in fact, quantum computers, it's proven that they don't have a complexity speed up for

300
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,440
 for traveling salesmen.

301
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
 they probably could do it faster.

302
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,160
 but the point is

303
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,360
 getting a shaving a,

304
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
 you know, a millionth of a second to get the optimal

305
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,839
 mathematical

306
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,240
 answer.

307
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
 this is something scientists are interested in.

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
 this isn't something uber is interested in or or they would be investing.

309
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,480
 fedex would be investing in quantum computing.

310
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,079
 ups would be investing in quantum computing.

311
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,959
 these guys have a lot of money.

312
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,680
 they would be doing it.

313
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,320
 they're not.

314
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
 why did jensen why did jensen have them on stage?

315
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,079
 so it's interesting you know you know this is really fascinating.

316
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
 my girlfriend's dad was a senior guy at nvidia

317
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 and one of the funny things here

318
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,800
 not that that gives me any insight but

319
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,680
 you know i've been following

320
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,079
 nvidia

321
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,800
 my whole life

322
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,200
 and

323
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,760
 you know it's

324
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,240
 the greatest

325
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
 company in the world.

326
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,519
 the the question is

327
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
 you know so he goes on stage before that and he says quantum's 30 years away.

328
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,839
 it doesn't work.

329
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,720
 it's not interesting right and the quantum stocks you know fall.

330
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,640
 i made like $2 million that day and i

331
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:08,880
 am

332
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,120
 sitting

333
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,519
 there watching

334
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:09,760
 this

335
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,000
 like

336
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,720
 oh this is great

337
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,120
 you know

338
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,360
 and

339
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,760
 he shits

340
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,519
 on them over and over again and the problem becomes

341
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,000
 these quantum

342
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,600
 companies call him and say hey man you know you really did a number on

343
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 us

344
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,120
 you know this is

345
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,320
 you know what the hell you know and i think jensen

346
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,720
 just in that moment had this flashback

347
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
 to like

348
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,560
 when he

349
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,320
 was you know making gpus

350
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 and everyone was laughing at him saying ah gpus

351
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,279
 don't matter

352
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
 gpus will never make a difference

353
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,920
 and he is obviously right in the long run.

354
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,360
 and he basically said, i i can't be that guy, you know?

355
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,480
 i can't be the guy [ __ ] on entrepreneurs,

356
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,279
 crapping on their dreams, telling them they're never going to work.

357
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360
 i have to at least hear these guys out.

358
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,360
 this is the guy who knows the most about computing on planet earth.

359
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,640
 and he said in his heart of hearts, he said, "30 years away."

360
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,000
 you know, he didn't change his mind.

361
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
 he didn't say, "ah, you know what?

362
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,120
 actually, it's next year." he he still thinks it's 30 years away.

363
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,079
 and i feel like again, you know, we all want to be bullish on something.

364
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,000
 we all want to get the next 100 bagger.

365
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
 but just be careful what you wish for because

366
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,839
 there's a lot of people that quit the stock market

367
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,079
 after they bought wheat stocks and they dropped 90%.

368
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,880
 people quit the stock market or or

369
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,079
 quit financial life when they bought board apes at a million dollars.

370
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,639
 i know a guy who had to sell his private jet,

371
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,800
 you know, he bought a ton of board apes and nftts.

372
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,160
 this is real life.

373
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,240
 you know, he literally was a private jet guy.

374
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,160
 jet's gone.

375
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,839
 so he still support ape.

376
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
 i mean be that guy.

377
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
 there was a guy who bought beles nft for 69 million.

378
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,240
 i think it's worth 20,000 from the last projections i saw.

379
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
 i mean if you want to be that guy,

380
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:39,760
 knock

381
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,399
 yourself out,

382
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,279
 you know, but i i

383
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,480
 feel like

384
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
 you're paying.

385
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
 do you think there is so much momentum

386
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,800
 in terms of liquidity for re like retail's buying palunteer, tesla, nvidia?

387
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,600
 is there

388
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,079
 that much free money out there even with more

389
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,120
 rates that that money is going into quantum and and these types of stocks?

390
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
 i think we're in a we're almost in a postmoney

391
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,160
 world and i think the way this sounds this is a little philosophical

392
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,880
 but

393
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,760
 we're we're getting to a point where where money in essence is worthless

394
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
 you know and things like

395
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,480
 um attention is is a new

396
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,440
 a new currency

397
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,600
 right when you you know it's it's it's kind of anecdotal

398
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
 here but again

399
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,880
 you know hang philosophically for a second

400
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
 20 years ago in new york city

401
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,120
 the average

402
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,440
 beautiful

403
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,839
 woman

404
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,000
 cared about what job you had how much money you had

405
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,320
 right

406
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,959
 you know nowadays

407
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,320
 they might say well how many followers

408
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,279
 does he have

409
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,839
 you know and it's one of these things that's a really

410
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,079
 a shift because what can money buy you?

411
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,839
 you know, i had lunch with

412
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,160
 peter

413
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,480
 teal

414
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,880
 like

415
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,600
 20 years ago

416
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,639
 and he had this iphone

417
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,680
 and i'm sitting there saying,

418
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,079
 "man,

419
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,279
 this guy's worth like hundred

420
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:37,680
 zillion

421
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,399
 times

422
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,279
 what i'm worth.

423
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,760
 i got nothing."

424
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
 and

425
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,160
 you know, i'm just starting my first drug company

426
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,839
 and he's got the same phone i do.

427
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,720
 there's no luxury.

428
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,079
 we're eating the same meal.

429
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
 you know, what does being rich really get you?

430
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
 and and the top the inflation's

431
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
 been the top the highest

432
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,839
 the higher the price the asset is.

433
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,240
 so sports teams have gone up 20x.

434
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
 picassos have gone up 10x.

435
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,560
 the stuff that you know the bevelin goods have gone up.

436
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,199
 the rest of us live the same life as even the wealthiest people.

437
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,320
 so money becomes one of these things that's that's really not that important.

438
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,959
 when covid happened, our economy didn't go to zero.

439
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,720
 everyone kind of threw a party.

440
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
 you know, it was a very bizarre like, you know, thing.

441
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
 unemployment's the lowest it's ever been.

442
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,079
 i'm not sure.

443
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,440
 and then finally, people use real money to chase crazy assets.

444
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,680
 a fartcoin,

445
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
 ethereum,

446
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,079
 you know, bitcoin, etc. these are interesting projects, but they're probably not worth trillions of dollars.

447
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
 and i think the fact that people have disposable income, look, this is a market.

448
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,880
 this is a cycle.

449
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,519
 you know, at the bottom of the cycle, you know, it'll be different.

450
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,120
 and there's always a bottom of the cycle.

451
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,360
 and it doesn't feel like if i had to pick,

452
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
 it feels like we're closer to the top than the bottom.

453
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:42,320
 okay.

454
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,600
 so, i have a couple more questions on quantum,

455
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,519
 and then i then i want to get into some thoughts around bitcoin,

456
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,320
 pounder,

457
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,920
 uh, nvidia, broader market.

458
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,000
 first of all, martin, we thank you for taking your time, bro.

459
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,959
 really appreciate it.

460
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,720
 uh, martin's twitter, i'm putting it right here in the chat.

461
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,600
 he's doing some awesome stuff building a nice bloomberg competitor.

462
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,120
 so you guys can check that out.

463
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,240
 there's his twitter right there.

464
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,480
 okay.

465
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,360
 so here's a question.

466
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,160
 are you accusing the quantum ceos of fraud?

467
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,920
 um you know, yes and no.

468
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,000
 so i think that

469
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,399
 i think that

470
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,399
 they're,

471
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,760
 you know, fra fraud, the definition of fraud is something i'm very familiar with.

472
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,880
 um are they knowingly it's a very technical thing.

473
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,839
 sometimes i' i've beaten it and i've also lost it.

474
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,560
 um yeah, the the technical definition usually is are you knowingly misleading others?

475
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,480
 are you knowingly saying false things?

476
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
 i think the answer to that is unequivocally yes.

477
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
 um but you know to other people it means other things.

478
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,199
 if you have a safe harbor

479
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:37,519
 statement

480
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,160
 you wrap yourself

481
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,199
 around it and say

482
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,240
 well you know these these

483
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,720
 are subject

484
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,440
 to forward-looking

485
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,800
 statements and you know

486
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
 you know you can kind of do that and say

487
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,360
 you know i we may not build a quantum computer tomorrow.

488
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,320
 you don't know.

489
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,000
 so i think there's like

490
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,519
 it's kind it's kind of like you saying not financial

491
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:51,839
 advice

492
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,279
 even though you don't believe in saying that right.

493
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:53,360
 yeah.

494
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
 i don't believe i personally

495
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,040
 don't believe in saying that

496
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,440
 but but

497
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,079
 i do think it's

498
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,480
 one of these

499
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,040
 disclaimers

500
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,839
 where

501
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,720
 if you

502
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 you know if you really pin down

503
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,040
 the

504
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,360
 quantum

505
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,680
 computing

506
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,000
 companies

507
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
 they would never do an interview with me because i'd say

508
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:04,800
 what date

509
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,839
 what date is it coming

510
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,199
 and what will it do

511
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,680
 and what what's it going to do better and who is going to buy it

512
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,480
 and they won't be able to answer these questions because they're hard questions

513
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,040
 and the reality is these companies are built on

514
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,839
 imaginations

515
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,079
 that are wilder than possibility

516
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,519
 again like

517
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,440
 you know it's okay to have a great imagination

518
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,360
 like i have to do that as a business person.

519
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,680
 i dream one day that i can bring quantitative

520
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,800
 investing to the masses and you can trade like jane street and set it up.

521
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,680
 that's my dream.

522
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
 is it realistic?

523
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,320
 maybe, maybe not.

524
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,000
 but it's possible.

525
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,880
 the quantum stuff is just not possible.

526
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,040
 you know, the the laws of physics and computing prohibit what they're talking about.

527
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,639
 now, again, could there one day be computers

528
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,480
 made by inq or regetti, not by dwaver quantum computing, inc.

529
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
 because i don't think they have anything at all

530
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:50,399
 and

531
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:50,720
 nobody

532
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,680
 even pays those companies

533
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,240
 any attention

534
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,880
 in the community.

535
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,320
 prescll said prescll said that d-wave is a fraud.

536
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,160
 u this is a theoretical physics professor.

537
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,880
 he doesn't normally go out and call companies fraud.

538
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
 scott aaron said dwave is a fraud.

539
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,480
 um but the real two companies ion q and regetti

540
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
 you know which are

541
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
 the also rans these are runs of the litter

542
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,679
 right so the big quantum companies are ibm

543
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,160
 number one i'd say google number two quantinium number three

544
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,880
 sci quantum number four there's six more privates and then ionq and then we're getting

545
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,520
 so like these are the runs of the litter these aren't even the good pups

546
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,039
 and you know

547
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,600
 so

548
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,679
 they have a shot at maybe making a quantum computer someday, but there's no obvious

549
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,400
 thing they can do.

550
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,520
 so to me, fraud means, you know, we know we don't know what the application is.

551
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,640
 we know

552
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
 that we we don't know if we can make these or not,

553
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,160
 but we're going to

554
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,960
 still stoke

555
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,440
 excitement

556
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,240
 about it.

557
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
 now, these companies almost went bankrupt.

558
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,799
 so, they've had feast and they've had famine.

559
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
 they were two years ago, d-wave is this close to bankruptcy

560
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,880
 because they couldn't get people excited.

561
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,919
 so, as an entrepreneur, i kind of understand it's great when people are excited,

562
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,080
 but i do think some of these have been really responsible.

563
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,559
 i'll give credit real quick to answer your question definitively.

564
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,200
 the regetti ceo has been superb at saying, "don't expect revenue, right?

565
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,080
 don't expect us to make a machine anytime soon.

566
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
 we are a research company.

567
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,880
 stop thinking this is a near-term thing." and he's done that.

568
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,280
 and i

569
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,679
 have to applaud

570
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
 him for doing that because the other guys are

571
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,760
 trying to tell you

572
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,080
 quantum

573
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,880
 is now.

574
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,320
 be excited today.

575
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,120
 and look, five

576
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,000
 years can a lot can happen in five years, but as of right now, these machines

577
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,799
 are completely

578
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,240
 useless.

579
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,039
 the d-wave came out with some advanced hardware a week ago.

580
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,160
 what are your thoughts on that?

581
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,000
 yeah, so they won't let anybody try it,

582
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,080
 you know, and i think that's very telling

583
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,640
 because

584
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,200
 iq

585
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
 lets me use their machine,

586
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,240
 you know, despite i'm the biggest, you know, i'm the biggest, you know, skeptic.

587
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
 ibm lets me use their machine.

588
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,240
 uh, brietti lets me use their machine.

589
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,000
 new era lets me use their machine.

590
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,960
 all of these other companies that have you reached out, did you wave?

591
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,760
 i have.

592
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,080
 yeah.

593
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,679
 and they said, "no,

594
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,440
 you you cannot get this machine

595
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,520
 without them banging you over the head trying to sell upsell you consulting services."

596
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,799
 so many people have published there's a website called archive arxiv.

597
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,240
 it's a scientific website.

598
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,720
 many many many people who have access to dwave machine have published and showed

599
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,840
 that there is no speed up with the dwave machine.

600
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,960
 and in fact, you know, friends with a hedge fund called carousel,

601
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,480
 they put a short report out.

602
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,000
 um carousel does real work.

603
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,720
 they're not, you know, you know, uh, scammers.

604
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
 they they've been in the hedge fun business a really long time.

605
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,320
 they don't get everything right.

606
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,960
 but in essence, you know, um,

607
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
 they they they found that

608
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,000
 mostly what d-wave

609
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 does is they take their quantum computer,

610
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
 they attach it to a real computer,

611
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,679
 they give you the result, and they say, you know,

612
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,480
 that that

613
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,960
 they're doing something, but really the quantum part is not doing anything.

614
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,400
 and a former d-wave employee said that the quantum part's just for show.

615
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,799
 so this company's been around 20 years.

616
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,799
 they've had six generations of this computer.

617
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,200
 they have the latest generation out now.

618
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
 can't find anybody

619
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,720
 that says, "i use this computer and it helps me." can't find a single person.

620
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,640
 have you looked into any of the partnerships they have?

621
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,200
 any of iota, mastercard, stuff like that?

622
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,760
 yeah, we have.

623
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
 so, so, so all the people we've talked to

624
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,160
 have said carisdale and we have talked to almost everybody.

625
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,760
 they've pointed out everybody says quietly behind closed doors, it was a research agreement.

626
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,799
 it was an attempt.

627
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,840
 it was an attempt.

628
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,480
 look, mastercard is a $500 billion company.

629
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
 it was an attempt to

630
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,799
 think about possibly maybe improving

631
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,120
 one process at mastercard and it failed.

632
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,400
 and there's a reason if if any of these companies

633
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
 like the d-wave machine, they would have a hundred million in revenue.

634
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
 they would have a billion in revenue if these machines were useful.

635
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,039
 they don't have any revenue.

636
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,280
 nobody's buying these [ __ ] things.

637
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,559
 well, that's what's been confusing to me.

638
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:46,960
 obviously,

639
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
 i've got some people that have been excited about quantum

640
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,640
 and you know, i saw these stocks at three.

641
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,039
 my kind of value investor hat said i can't buy them.

642
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,320
 then i see them go to 20

643
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
 and i'm like, am i the idiot or is yours,

644
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,600
 you know, like what's going on here?

645
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
 and i think you would say,

646
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,440
 yeah,

647
00:20:59,440 --> 00:20:59,600
 you're

648
00:20:59,600 --> 00:20:59,919
 kind of dumb

649
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,080
 for

650
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,320
 not buying

651
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,480
 at

652
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:00,799
 three because it

653
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,120
 could have gone

654
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,520
 to 20.

655
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,240
 but realistically,

656
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
 chasing it at 20 here is is a little scary.

657
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,559
 oh, yeah.

658
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,640
 it's nuts, it's nuts to even think about buying them here.

659
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
 but i would say look at three

660
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,200
 you know part part of you know there there was a technology in biotech

661
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,799
 um called rnai

662
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,440
 and and people were skeptical about rnai including myself and rna rnai

663
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
 came through it came it happened it really transpired

664
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,039
 and it i wouldn't say it changed the face of medicine

665
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,600
 but it was a real thing and it worked

666
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,919
 um so it doesn't mean that technology can't work but when you're pricing in

667
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,320
 the industry become actually not just working but becoming huge right very soon

668
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,880
 that that's where the value investor has to say no

669
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
 there's a chance it doesn't work right and that chance is actually pretty decent

670
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,919
 there's a chance that even if it works you're not the company that wins

671
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,440
 and then there's a chance commercializing

672
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,360
 it's not going to be great and then there's a chance that you know

673
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,559
 if you discount all these cash flows nothing's happening it's terrible investment

674
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,679
 so i feel like you know lotto tickets are out there fartcoin

675
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,960
 is worth a billion

676
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,520
 nftts

677
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,159
 are are

678
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,760
 not really having a comeback but there's meme coins are the new form of nfts

679
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,559
 so those have been out a bubble there's other bubbles in

680
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,159
 um like some of these aviation stocks, nuclear, you know, a bunch of stuff.

681
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,320
 people want the big bull win.

682
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,200
 and i get that.

683
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,240
 you know, everybody wants the 100x, but

684
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,720
 you know, this this is exactly what cannabis felt like.

685
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,480
 it's exactly what nftts felt like.

686
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,880
 and

687
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,159
 every you look, people will literally

688
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,720
 tell you to your face, you're stupid for not owning fartcoin,

689
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,440
 and you're stupid for not owning board ape at $1 million.

690
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,200
 well, board ape's $10,000 now.

691
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,000
 and

692
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
 you know, there there were people that were bamboozled,

693
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,960
 basically tricked into buying board apes for millions of dollars.

694
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,720
 and you know that that's what this is.

695
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,280
 yeah.

696
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,919
 could you know it's dazzling when you look at the port ape?

697
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,480
 it went from zero to a million.

698
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,799
 yeah.

699
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,600
 and at a million a bunch of people said i can't take it anymore.

700
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,799
 i have to buy it.

701
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,440
 you know, and the price action's too good.

702
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,799
 what if it goes to 10 million?

703
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,240
 this is going to be like a picasso.

704
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,760
 picasso's at 100 million.

705
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,360
 this might be bigger than picasso.

706
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,240
 so it's a it's a steal at a million.

707
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,720
 well, just listen to common sense.

708
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,039
 that's what's been confusing me because you got amazing

709
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,080
 companies like an nvidia

710
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,200
 and pounder that fell damn near 40 50% over the past two months,

711
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,600
 right?

712
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
 people went into the most speculative

713
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,760
 parts

714
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,280
 of the market and that's where i'm like

715
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:11,679
 what

716
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:12,559
 stage of a cycle

717
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,679
 is this or is this even

718
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,039
 i think i think it's the kappam

719
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:15,520
 frontier.

720
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,640
 so the kappam frontier,

721
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,600
 you know, it it basically

722
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,159
 just says

723
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,360
 the more risk you take,

724
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,000
 the more reward

725
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,640
 you get,

726
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,039
 right?

727
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,320
 that is true.

728
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
 so, who looks the best when the when there's high beta?

729
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,280
 when the market's going up, the highest risk stuff looks the most attractive.

730
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,559
 and you sit there having fomo saying, "oh, i really want that fcoin.

731
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,559
 it went up 30% in a day.

732
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,799
 imagine if my portfolio went up 30% a day.

733
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,760
 i'd be rich."

734
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
 and then you realize that, wait a second,

735
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,919
 no, there

736
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,760
 it doesn't make sense to buy something called fcoin.

737
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
 it doesn't really make sense to buy something in quantum computing.

738
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,679
 maybe i should buy coca-cola.

739
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,200
 you buy coca-cola, it doesn't move.

740
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,640
 in fact, it might go down.

741
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,880
 and so, it's it's frustrating being an investor.

742
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,600
 it's not easy.

743
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,080
 but the answer is not buy the riskiest asset that you can find.

744
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,120
 options, for example, a lot of people love to trade options.

745
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,240
 they wipe out their account,

746
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,400
 they

747
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,559
 put

748
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:00,720
 more

749
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:00,960
 money in

750
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,120
 their

751
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,280
 account

752
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,440
 when

753
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,600
 they

754
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:01,760
 have

755
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:01,919
 when

756
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:02,320
 they have it, and

757
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,480
 they

758
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,640
 wipe

759
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:02,880
 it out

760
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,440
 again.

761
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,600
 and i i just really think there's a better way to invest that is exciting

762
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,280
 but not stupid.

763
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,840
 and

764
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
 um you know, of course, there's no easy easy way to do it.

765
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,720
 the quant funds are basically just running rough shot over the whole market.

766
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
 they're making so much money that you know, it's it's sick.

767
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,880
 and

768
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,080
 um you know if you can't beat them, join them in a way.

769
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,200
 and i think that you know trading as a human

770
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,559
 is extremely difficult and i i just wouldn't advise it.

771
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,480
 and and again i can't believe

772
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,400
 i'm saying this but you're it's like playing chess against a machine.

773
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,320
 you know not even magnus carlson can beat the chess machine but you want to try?

774
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,039
 you know i i don't think you can beat citadel and jane street.

775
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,919
 i think the only

776
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,760
 way to do it is to sort of play the game on their level which

777
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,960
 it's hard.

778
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,559
 last question on quantum, then i want to move on.

779
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:50,960
 uh,

780
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,679
 how leveraged

781
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,320
 are you into these shorts and could you blow up your entire

782
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
 net worth if this goes against you?

783
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,559
 yeah.

784
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,480
 so, i've been in this situation a million times.

785
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,799
 um, you know, i i am not worried about that.

786
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,799
 you know, unlike other people, i do have access to capital outside of just my own.

787
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,120
 yeah.

788
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,320
 so, i've been making the rounds to various billionaires.

789
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,159
 as this trade goes up,

790
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,039
 i have more confidence to go to the people i used to work with,

791
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,400
 to go to the people i met

792
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,200
 in my travels

793
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
 over the years

794
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,880
 and say, "listen,

795
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,919
 i i got a deal for you.

796
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
 this is this is the greatest trade i've ever seen.

797
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,480
 do you want to short these stocks?" it's an unbelievable opportunity.

798
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,919
 and if they go up higher,

799
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,919
 i just raise more capital and find more capital

800
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,200
 and and short more of it because and what are these conversations with the billionaires

801
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,360
 like?

802
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,720
 are they like, "holy crap, this is a bubble.

803
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,000
 take as much money as you want." it's pretty exciting.

804
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
 you know, they they a lot of these guys are long stuff, so

805
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,559
 finding

806
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:40,880
 shorts

807
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,840
 is is

808
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,000
 something they're interested in.

809
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,520
 they don't have mark tomarket.

810
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,679
 the hedge funds can't short right now, right?

811
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,679
 that's why these stocks are popping as well.

812
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,200
 gamestop just put a kibos on shorting.

813
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,640
 and the hedge funds, if a short goes against them, even 10%, they're out.

814
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,440
 they're chicken.

815
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,320
 in my day, tiger soros, i worked at a tiger cub.

816
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,440
 we had we were fearless.

817
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,600
 the fund i was worked for literally was called intrepid.

818
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,880
 we had no fear.

819
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,039
 we were short of stock if it went up 10x on us.

820
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:07,919
 doesn't matter.

821
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,120
 we're short more.

822
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,400
 and you know, melvin was was a tiger cup, too.

823
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,440
 a lot of people don't know this.

824
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,919
 and when our funds interacted a lot and

825
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,880
 you know, melvin should have stuck through the gamestop short.

826
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
 they should have just kept piling in.

827
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,679
 and he had the capital.

828
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,520
 i think he didn't want to do it for business reasons because he had

829
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
 um

830
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
 you know, his firm, he didn't want to sort of continue with that firm

831
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,919
 and owe investors more money.

832
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,120
 and it was like a technical reason, but he absolutely could have

833
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,919
 gotten five billion from here, five billion from there, and said,

834
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:38,640
 "game on.

835
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,279
 i raise you.

836
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,360
 i re-ra." and i think that, you know, he should have done that.

837
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,760
 but, you know, i think that he had his own reasons.

838
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,720
 he's still a billionaire.

839
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,480
 you know, he's not sitting there crying.

840
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,559
 um, and i think, you know, it's the same way.

841
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,679
 you know, i'm a professional.

842
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,799
 i'm not worried about, you know, uh, these stocks going up.

843
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,000
 they could go up more.

844
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
 they could go up 50x.

845
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,440
 you know, anything could happen.

846
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,320
 but we will find a way to pop the bubble and make money on the trade.

847
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,720
 now, tiger and soros, two of the biggest firms in the world in 2000,

848
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,840
 they quit at the top shorting

849
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,559
 right at the top.

850
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,320
 they said, "i can't take it anymore.

851
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,960
 get me out.

852
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
 cover these shorts." and guess what happened?

853
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,840
 it was over.

854
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,360
 that was the literal top of the nasdaq.

855
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,600
 it took 15 years to come back.

856
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,799
 so, you know, you have supreme confidence on this.

857
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,360
 what's that?

858
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,039
 you have supreme confidence on this trade.

859
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,279
 yeah.

860
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,080
 i mean, i you know, i i try to be sober,

861
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,440
 but if i look at the the history of all the stuff i've shorted over 25

862
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
 years,

863
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,240
 this is up there.

864
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,279
 i mean, i remember shorting internet stocks in 2000,

865
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,240
 and you know, it was it was hard to fight that narrative.

866
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,480
 martin, don't you know, the internet's going to be the biggest thing ever?

867
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:42,880
 of course.

868
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,840
 yeah, i use it.

869
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,200
 i'm a kid.

870
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,880
 and you know, people told me, you know, you're fighting with fire.

871
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,000
 the economy is changing.

872
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,760
 all the rules are going to be rewritten,

873
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
 etc., etc. and you know, it didn't bother me.

874
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,320
 it didn't phase me.

875
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,080
 you know, quantum isn't anything like that.

876
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,120
 you know, quantum is not going to change the world like the internet did.

877
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,399
 quantum is not going to change the world like ai is is doing as we speak.

878
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,919
 it's it's really a farce.

879
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,600
 and it's a me tooism.

880
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,880
 it's a it's a fomo.

881
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,919
 you know, i missed ai.

882
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,880
 i missed nvidia.

883
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,679
 i need the next thing.

884
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:10,960
 what's the next big thing?

885
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,679
 well, look, i mean, you know, there are stocks that are privately held.

886
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,120
 i think one of the biggest problems

887
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,440
 you and my communities are going to have is that these stocks like spacex

888
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,159
 privately held.

889
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,360
 you and i can't buy them.

890
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,679
 yeah.

891
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,039
 you know, you need you need millions of hard spot at least.

892
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,440
 and spacex went from five billion to 350 billion.

893
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,399
 sucks for you.

894
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,120
 sucks for me.

895
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,320
 you're saying retail investors

896
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,360
 see the big guys make money by getting in early because they're accredited.

897
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,600
 and then they flock to fartcoin to make up for that.

898
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
 but that you're you're you're chasing that.

899
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,320
 you you want the spacex, you want the open ai, but guess what?

900
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,360
 you're not in that club and you'll never be in that club.

901
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,320
 and i really like palmer lucky at anderole.

902
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,600
 i'm proud to call a friend.

903
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,200
 he wants to take his company public because he doesn't he wants the average joe

904
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,520
 to be able to buy his stock and palunteer

905
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,760
 did did the same thing and look at how many millionaires palanteer has made you know

906
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,279
 retalier my channel my community is heavily focused on it.

907
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,640
 what are your thoughts on this name?

908
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,440
 it's amazing company.

909
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,919
 i mean you know you you you can't deny the unbelievable success they've had.

910
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,240
 as i said, i have a somewhat of a conflict of interest, but the the the

911
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,720
 the llm

912
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
 revolution

913
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,279
 is is, you know, changing the world.

914
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,120
 what palanteer does, which i think a lot of people don't know.

915
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,080
 a lot of people say nobody knows what they do, etc., etc.

916
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,520
 it's it's not the case.

917
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,279
 um, in essence, what they're doing now is they're taking llm

918
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,679
 and going to businesses that don't understand how to implement them across enterprises.

919
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,919
 so, you and i know how to use lms.

920
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,080
 dear chatbot, uh, my girlfriend is mad at me, you know, what should i say?

921
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,320
 and you hit enter.

922
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,559
 um, you know, or or you ask it something more complicated.

923
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,600
 even coders know how to use it to write code.

924
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,520
 i i use it every day to write code.

925
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,679
 uh, but at an enterprise, it's a little different.

926
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,440
 you know, at an enterprise, you might have something like

927
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,520
 coca-cola has a a a invoices from around the world that they need to translate.

928
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,840
 so what they do is they they hire translators,

929
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,640
 send them to the translators, they wait for the response back.

930
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,520
 it's a real pain in the neck and you can't do it automated.

931
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,640
 so it's done by hand.

932
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,799
 so there's people that manage the translators, right?

933
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,720
 and you know, all this stuff and

934
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,679
 you know, you have controls

935
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,240
 and audit

936
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,000
 and things like that that have to look over it.

937
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,320
 so palunteer comes in and says, you know what,

938
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
 we can write the software that does all of this.

939
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,440
 we already have it.

940
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,960
 we just have to implement it.

941
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,279
 and basically all this will go from

942
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,480
 800 people or 200 people and it doesn't matter what it is.

943
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,559
 invoicing, it can be document translation, it could be intake, whatever it is.

944
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,880
 and we're going to use lms to offtheshelf lm.

945
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,000
 we don't have to use openai.

946
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,240
 we can use deepseek or we could use whatever.

947
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,880
 and

948
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,039
 we're going to make this so it's a bulletproof

949
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,480
 business process that just runs with five people

950
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,200
 and

951
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,760
 you know you you're going to save 100 million bucks a year

952
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
 and our software is going to be really expensive.

953
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,799
 we're going to take like 20 million of that, but you're going to love it.

954
00:30:58,799 --> 00:30:59,600
 and

955
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,039
 is that why you think they're getting the multiple

956
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:02,080
 because they are the most expensive

957
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,399
 software

958
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,159
 stock in the market.

959
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,320
 well, so you know what's interesting about multiples is

960
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,600
 they only make sense if the company's in a steady state,

961
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,240
 you know, so

962
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,039
 you can pay 18

963
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:11,360
 times

964
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,240
 for the market because

965
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,600
 on average the market's growing

966
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,559
 a small amount,

967
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,039
 right?

968
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,960
 coca-cola, proctor and gamble, you can kind of eyeball, okay, the growth is like this.

969
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,600
 but when a company has sales that are growth that's changing rapidly, everything everything changes.

970
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,720
 you know, the the the funny thing about palunteer

971
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,480
 that's really bizarre, and this happened to me with google in in

972
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,360
 when google ipoed around

973
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
 2005,

974
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,480
 the second derivative of sales can go up.

975
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:38,799
 almost

976
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,840
 all of us in normal

977
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,240
 life,

978
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,600
 we're used to the more you

979
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,159
 the faster

980
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,760
 you grow and the more money you make,

981
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,080
 just

982
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,559
 it slows

983
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,120
 down.

984
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,600
 you know, you can't the it's the law of large numbers.

985
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,799
 you can't grow faster.

986
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,159
 it doesn't make sense, right?

987
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,279
 that's what's happening in palanteer.

988
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,200
 and i think it's going to be a situation.

989
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,440
 i talk to people who tell me, "pounder's expensive.

990
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,880
 isn't it crazy?" i said, "hold on, hold on.

991
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,919
 let's do the math.

992
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,840
 first of all, you have to look at free cash flow.

993
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,279
 everyone looks at revenue or something like that." it's like, "no, no, no, no.

994
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,720
 start with the cash.

995
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
 are they making cash?

996
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,840
 how much are they making?" you do the numbers and it's actually quite reasonable.

997
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
 60% free cash flow margins.

998
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,000
 yeah.

999
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,159
 yeah.

1000
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,559
 i don't i don't my model in front of me, but i think it's around

1001
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,279
 100 times

1002
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,159
 free cash flow.

1003
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,480
 and again, you might say, "martin, that's a lot." well, hold on.

1004
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,279
 if free cash flow is going to double every year for the next five years,

1005
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,559
 which they might beat that.

1006
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,840
 i think that, you know, you're talking about, you know, pretty insane.

1007
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,840
 you know, two to the fifth is 16 billion.

1008
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,919
 so, company makes 16 billion.

1009
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,320
 uh,

1010
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,760
 you you can put a multiple on that and you get a stock price that's higher.

1011
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
 look, it's not a cheap stock.

1012
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,799
 it's not for the faint of heart.

1013
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,240
 it's gone up a lot.

1014
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
 um, would would i rather buy it at 60 or 80?

1015
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,200
 yeah.

1016
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,279
 you know, it's it's it's but it is an unbelievably well-run company.

1017
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,360
 i think revenue is going to growth is going to accelerate.

1018
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,039
 earnings growth is going to accelerate

1019
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,039
 and that's what nobody prices in

1020
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,039
 is that it's growing 40%

1021
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,880
 okay it's going to go back down to 30 then

1022
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,200
 20

1023
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:57,760
 then 10.

1024
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,960
 nobody has in their model

1025
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,519
 80%

1026
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,559
 revenue growth

1027
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,559
 which they very easily could do

1028
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,440
 and

1029
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,679
 they're

1030
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:03,919
 fighting

1031
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,320
 hard to

1032
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,440
 do it and i don't know how you bet

1033
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:05,679
 against

1034
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:06,640
 that like i mean the execution

1035
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,120
 is off

1036
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,919
 off the charts.

1037
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,600
 okay so last question on pounder alex karp.

1038
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,919
 how do you feel about him as a ceo?

1039
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:12,720
 i think he's really great.

1040
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,159
 i mean, the individualism is something that in 2015,

1041
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,640
 you know, i i went through this little business crisis myself and, you know, people said,

1042
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,440
 the pr people said, "you just got to be quiet.

1043
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,120
 you're being too individualistic.

1044
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,159
 people know who you are.

1045
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,440
 they know your quirks.

1046
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,080
 just

1047
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
 don't do it." and i ask you, do you know

1048
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,519
 who the ceo of eli liy is?

1049
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,440
 do you know by firstname basis and what his quirks are?

1050
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,799
 do you know the ceo of bristol myers?

1051
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:36,000
 do you know the ceo of amjen?

1052
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,240
 no.

1053
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,679
 they're all flat suits.

1054
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,559
 ceo of coca-cola.

1055
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,840
 i have no idea.

1056
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
 i'm supposed to be a business expert.

1057
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,000
 i love the markets.

1058
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,799
 i don't know who these people are, but you know who alex karp is.

1059
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,760
 you know who palmer lucky is?

1060
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,880
 you know who elon musk is?

1061
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,760
 you know who mark zuckerberg is.

1062
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,799
 you know who sam alman is.

1063
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,000
 because they're real people.

1064
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,799
 they're individuals.

1065
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,760
 they have flaws.

1066
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,799
 they have great features.

1067
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,000
 alex, you know, is really interesting individual.

1068
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,559
 and and

1069
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,440
 you know, one of the greatest people in business today is this woman named lulu

1070
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,159
 chang

1071
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,039
 who's

1072
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,679
 mostly an adviser to ceos.

1073
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,720
 proud to call her a friend.

1074
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,279
 she advises some of these ceos that i just mentioned.

1075
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,119
 and she's told them like

1076
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,239
 martin was the first guy to actually stick his neck out and be himself.

1077
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,679
 and now people like palmer,

1078
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,760
 well palmer always was, but people

1079
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,879
 people have said, you know, i'm i'm gonna show everyone the the real me.

1080
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,480
 and it's better than the fake me.

1081
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,320
 and alex has flaws.

1082
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,159
 you know, he's he's weird,

1083
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,639
 but he's one of these guys that lets it all hang out.

1084
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,280
 and you know who he is, and you know that you can believe in him.

1085
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,918
 and that's why he has the cult that he's got.

1086
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,399
 and i think that, you know,

1087
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,079
 it's it's sort of a,

1088
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,000
 you know, a testament to his his success.

1089
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,839
 he's one of the best hiring,

1090
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,079
 you know, people in the world, which is what management's all about.

1091
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,520
 at the end of the day, one of the things i've learned over

1092
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,918
 time is

1093
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:44,159
 your

1094
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,719
 individual

1095
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,440
 contribution

1096
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,040
 is meaningless to most companies.

1097
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
 y, you know, once you get to thousand people, 2,000

1098
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,119
 people, what are you going to do personally

1099
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,320
 that lifts,

1100
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
 you know, the world, uh, that lifts your company?

1101
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,879
 nothing.

1102
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,760
 the only thing you could do is find really great people

1103
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,599
 and make those people work really well.

1104
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,720
 and this guy, i mean, the staff at palunteer,

1105
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,880
 i mean, i i don't know if there's another company in silicon

1106
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,720
 valley that's that's as good as them.

1107
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:06,960
 i'm

1108
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,920
 just so happy you said that because

1109
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,560
 i feel like most

1110
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,000
 of us have been saying that for the past couple years.

1111
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,440
 everyone, you know, alex karps

1112
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,079
 makes these weird

1113
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:12,400
 jokes

1114
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,960
 or he

1115
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
 puts his neck out and says that he does he just doesn't care what

1116
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:16,400
 his political beliefs.

1117
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,160
 he's not censoring himself censoring himself at all about how he thinks about the world.

1118
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,599
 but in exchange for the sacrifice of being yourself, you might develop an authentic audience.

1119
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,520
 i think that's one of the things i've done with my youtube channel.

1120
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,880
 that's one of the things you've done.

1121
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
 and that success.

1122
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:30,960
 yeah.

1123
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,079
 i talked to palmer lucky about this.

1124
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,760
 i mean, the number one thing

1125
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,280
 that you need to do at a company is you have to get people to believe.

1126
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,680
 yes.

1127
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,040
 and they have to when they believe they're working saturday and sunday.

1128
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,440
 when they believe they're they'll kill for you.

1129
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,480
 you know, it's it's that kind of religion at palunteer.

1130
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,119
 you know, a normal company guy's leaving at 5:00 p.m.

1131
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,079
 guy's checking out.

1132
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,200
 oh, another sick day.

1133
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,640
 oh, another vacation day.

1134
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,079
 that's not how it works at palanteer.

1135
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,440
 these guys are hellbent on success and they made each other rich.

1136
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
 every single guy at palanteer is a millionaire,

1137
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,599
 you know, and that's the kind of company you want to work at.

1138
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,839
 and it just creates this flywheel of success.

1139
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,920
 now, again, the numbers have to catch up, right?

1140
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
 but i don't see why they can't be a trillion dollar company.

1141
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
 i mean, you look at openai, which is obviously,

1142
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,160
 you know, going to be a trillion dollar company.

1143
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,160
 you

1144
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,119
 inevitably

1145
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,839
 have palunteer as the enterprise

1146
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:22,400
 kind of version of openai where they they basically are doing these like bespoke

1147
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,160
 ai applications

1148
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,960
 which are a bigger arguably

1149
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,440
 a bigger market than openai

1150
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,880
 because they go into the fortune 500 the whole their tam is the entire business world.

1151
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,200
 yeah.

1152
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,119
 which if you think about is is really nuts like they are actually

1153
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,800
 just applying ai

1154
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,839
 to solve

1155
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,800
 all

1156
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,760
 bottlenecks

1157
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,040
 all inefficiencies

1158
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,960
 of all corporations

1159
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,880
 and if you think about how big that tam

1160
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,560
 is like there's no reason they can't be a

1161
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,040
 10 trillion

1162
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,000
 dollar company

1163
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,320
 the the problem is markets

1164
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,599
 as you know we have to take things one quarter at a time

1165
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,320
 so

1166
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:58,880
 you know

1167
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,359
 it's it's

1168
00:36:59,359 --> 00:36:59,839
 one of these

1169
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,920
 things where it's like when do you buy it you know what if next

1170
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,160
 quarter

1171
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,640
 is bad

1172
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,920
 you're gonna it's going to be down

1173
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,720
 50%

1174
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,079
 so, you know, it's a really tough like thing to own,

1175
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,640
 but that's because markets price in

1176
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,359
 on a razor's edge, just the right price,

1177
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,359
 and you have to have this bet that he's going to execute to perfection

1178
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:20,320
 and then some, and you will get rewarded if that happens.

1179
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,440
 if he executes only well, look out below.

1180
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,720
 it's going to be a rough stock to own.

1181
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,480
 so, it's one of these stocks where like in during the tariff

1182
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,280
 tariff nightmare, you know, that's the stock you buy first.

1183
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,240
 know that's like

1184
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,520
 you put it on a list and you're like if it ever goes to this price

1185
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,320
 i'm going to buy it.

1186
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,640
 but you still have to watch the quarters like a hawk because

1187
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
 if they say, "look, things are slowing down.

1188
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,599
 we're not able to execute as well as we can, it's accenture

1189
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,960
 that's somehow competing with them and doing really well in ai implementations,

1190
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,640
 then you just have to call spade a spade."

1191
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,200
 but obviously,

1192
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,000
 you know, they're running

1193
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,640
 circles around

1194
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,119
 accenture

1195
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,440
 and booze allen and all these other like,

1196
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,599
 you know, old school systems integrators

1197
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,520
 that just charge you a fortune.

1198
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,680
 like, this is how ibm is still a $200 billion company.

1199
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,520
 like, if ibm's a $200 billion company, just do 5x whatever ibm's worth.

1200
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,040
 that's palanteer's words.

1201
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,680
 i love it.

1202
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,240
 i love it.

1203
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,960
 no, it's very encouraging to hear someone because you are very valuation heavy.

1204
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
 i watch your streams and you really go through the numbers.

1205
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,520
 so, everyone

1206
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,359
 that i hear from the bear side of pound share

1207
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,040
 been hearing for the past couple years is it's expensive,

1208
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,359
 expensive,

1209
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:19,920
 expensive.

1210
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,760
 but your thing happened 2006. google google went public.

1211
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,160
 the tiger cup community, like i said, is very close.

1212
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,400
 and

1213
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:26,640
 there's

1214
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,359
 this one guy who's

1215
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:27,599
 like

1216
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,119
 a little bit of a leader in the in that community,

1217
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:29,760
 steve mandel,

1218
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,720
 lone pine.

1219
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,760
 loine became the second largest stockholder of google.

1220
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,400
 wow.

1221
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,440
 second largest.

1222
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,560
 and people said, "steve's crazy." you know, how how people bought like 4% of google.

1223
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,720
 google, this was like 15 billion market cap or something like that.

1224
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,599
 and google, you know, had this torrential tear.

1225
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,520
 and everyone said, "how are you buying this thing?

1226
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,480
 it's 100 times their earnings.

1227
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,640
 it's etc." and he said, "you don't get it.

1228
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,320
 they're they're not they're growing 30% right now.

1229
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,079
 they're about to grow 50%."

1230
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,599
 for many years in a row, and cash flow is just going to double every year.

1231
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,440
 you know, you're messing with the wrong business.

1232
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,119
 you know, you have to buy this thing.

1233
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,240
 and he was right.

1234
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
 and every traditional value guy looked at and said, "i can't own this thing." yeah.

1235
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,720
 but value isn't about a pe multiple.

1236
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,200
 value isn't about any multiple.

1237
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,760
 value is about what are the long-term

1238
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,119
 steady state, you know, when the business is kind of maturing and in a normalized

1239
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,119
 situation.

1240
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,440
 when that happens, what are those cash flows like?

1241
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,400
 is it a billion?

1242
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,359
 is it five billion?

1243
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:26,320
 is it 20 billion?

1244
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,320
 for google, it's about a hundred billion.

1245
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,839
 and at the time

1246
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,680
 cash flow was like pretty meager

1247
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,280
 but you know you have to envision

1248
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,720
 what does it look like and palanteer

1249
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,760
 when you think about it

1250
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,480
 you say okay if they are in the enterprise at every fortune

1251
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,440
 500

1252
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,160
 fixing

1253
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,480
 broken systems fixing inefficiency if you've ever worked at a fortune 500

1254
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
 i i have briefly

1255
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,400
 you know the whole thing is a [ __ ] show

1256
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,280
 you know the whole thing's a mess with inefficiencies

1257
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,359
 so they go out there and say you've heard our reputation we're balancer we're like the

1258
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,119
 you know we're now

1259
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,640
 they used to be the weird kid four years ago.

1260
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:58,880
 now

1261
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,119
 people

1262
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,359
 want

1263
00:39:59,359 --> 00:39:59,760
 to partner

1264
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,480
 with them and because

1265
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,119
 they're kind of the poster

1266
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:01,839
 child of ai.

1267
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,800
 so i agree.

1268
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,359
 i want yeah.

1269
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,240
 and they do it for the government.

1270
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,320
 they say if we can do it for the cia,

1271
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,839
 you know, how can we do it for you?

1272
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,359
 i think that they're going to just

1273
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,520
 sort of run everything and it's going to be as everpresent

1274
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,400
 as ibm was in the 80s and things like that, you know.

1275
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,680
 so i'd say palanteer

1276
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,880
 still still,

1277
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,280
 you know, 3 to 5x at least, you know, but

1278
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,040
 it's it's one of these things as a value guy.

1279
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,359
 you're really sticking your neck out, you know, and

1280
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
 you don't want to get disappointed

1281
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,520
 because one bad quarter and that's all it takes.

1282
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,280
 but i do think that these these

1283
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,839
 what they do, how they implement ai, it actually does work.

1284
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,720
 you know, their customers are not paying them by accident.

1285
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,760
 you know, they are earning their their value.

1286
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,720
 yeah.

1287
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
 nvidia, is this the the greatest company in the world?

1288
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,560
 and can they keep up the growth?

1289
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,440
 i think so.

1290
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,200
 you know, i i briefly shorted the stock last night because

1291
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
 i just for a trade,

1292
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,880
 i think that the quarter was wasn't as good as i thought it would be.

1293
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,680
 but i think that nvidia has has three kind of major

1294
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,880
 um advantages that will just propagate it to 10 trillion market cap.

1295
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,079
 um why i'm shorting it.

1296
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,960
 again, i i just wanted an instant reaction to the quarter.

1297
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,640
 very very very small position.

1298
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,040
 think thousands of dollars, not millions of dollars.

1299
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,119
 and you know, so just like maybe it'll go down for five minutes kind of thing.

1300
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,480
 um and we all know that even even cheap stocks will sometimes

1301
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,920
 like digest a quarter that kind of like is really sloppy.

1302
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,960
 this is a bit of a sloppy quarter, but the three big things for nvidia

1303
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,440
 are

1304
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,240
 you have

1305
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,119
 agi,

1306
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,319
 which in essence is going to require huge amounts of compute.

1307
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,839
 claude was down yesterday.

1308
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,920
 we're we're big claude users over here.

1309
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,160
 as

1310
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,200
 much as i hate to admit it,

1311
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,440
 i

1312
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,560
 don't like the people at the company,

1313
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:36,960
 but

1314
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,280
 they

1315
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,240
 have great software.

1316
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,440
 we use claude

1317
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,760
 and the demand was so high for their latest model, the company couldn't serve it.

1318
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,319
 they crashed.

1319
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,599
 they have to rate limited it.

1320
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,160
 you know, there is no limit to the amount of intelligence

1321
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,040
 people want

1322
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,760
 that that and that's why palanteer is, you know, such a good long.

1323
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,680
 there is absolutely no limit to the amount of intelligence that

1324
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,520
 yeah, i'm almost breaking even here.

1325
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,000
 um the

1326
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,359
 um there's no limit.

1327
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,720
 yeah, still still holding an l, but

1328
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,119
 um yeah, i shorted at 139. i just thought the market would react negatively

1329
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,880
 even though they're obviously doing great.

1330
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,359
 you know, i thought that the market got too,

1331
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,520
 you know, is the prices just, you know, rel the expectations are very high.

1332
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,920
 turns out the people thought this would be a bad quarter

1333
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,079
 and they they put in an okay quarter, especially china.

1334
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,680
 yeah, that that's sort of, you know, a mess and it's hard to interpret,

1335
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,440
 you know, are they telling the truth?

1336
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,000
 is is china really that, you know, big of a business for them?

1337
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,160
 why can't china just get these chips from somewhere else?

1338
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,359
 it it's tough to digest, but if you zoom out, forget the shenanigans

1339
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,480
 of like the minations

1340
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,160
 of like the near-term quarter stuff,

1341
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,440
 which is, you know, on wall street, it's it's a it's a game

1342
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,720
 in essence

1343
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,079
 um of it's a poker game of whose position where and like is fidelity

1344
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:48,720
 going to sell?

1345
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,359
 is this good?

1346
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,560
 you're basically asking was this quarter good enough for fidelity?

1347
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,240
 fidelity is the biggest, you know,

1348
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,920
 single, it's the biggest mutual fund that actively manages their portfolio.

1349
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,640
 so, it's like what's fidelity going to do on this quarter?

1350
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,240
 has nothing to do with what you think.

1351
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,400
 it's all about what are the big market players going to do.

1352
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,760
 so, zooming out from that, you know, those near-term shenanigans,

1353
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,200
 the three big things, i mean, agi

1354
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,760
 is is

1355
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,240
 basically

1356
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,160
 every single person is going to have agi

1357
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,359
 and it's going to cost

1358
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,200
 it's going to make nvidia $100,000

1359
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,240
 per person.

1360
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,760
 um, it's going to be so productive

1361
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,240
 that

1362
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,160
 we you basically every human being is going to have a chip allocated to them practically

1363
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,000
 for for this new form of intelligence.

1364
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,280
 and it's going to be, you know, really cost-effective.

1365
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,280
 you know, you're going to get multiples of that in productivity.

1366
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,200
 the second big thing is autonomous vehicles.

1367
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,119
 um this is happening.

1368
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,280
 you know, the cars are driving themselves and that's not going to stop.

1369
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,680
 and these things need nvidia.

1370
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,440
 i i did a tour of whimo.

1371
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,520
 some whimo engineers were kind enough to give me a tour.

1372
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,720
 you know, they work great.

1373
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,839
 they're expanding to every city.

1374
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,280
 elon's dropping them, too.

1375
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,880
 these all run on ai.

1376
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,280
 they are they are ai machines on wheels and they cannot work without ai.

1377
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,240
 so it's a huge thing for nvidia and you're talking about

1378
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,480
 saving lives quite frankly and and

1379
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,040
 changing the face of of

1380
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
 transportation.

1381
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,920
 so that's not i think in the stock price at all.

1382
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,520
 and then the third thing is robotics.

1383
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,280
 you know this is like the beall endall.

1384
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,520
 elon's betting his life his legacy

1385
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,240
 basically

1386
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,400
 on robotics and he's saying there's going to be more robots than humans.

1387
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,680
 he's not kidding.

1388
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,960
 you know he really thinks that.

1389
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,480
 and if you want to have you want to be amazed

1390
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,240
 and we've seen some cool robot

1391
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,200
 stuff, but look at figure ai

1392
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
 figure.ai

1393
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,160
 they're you know they're making really nice humanoid robots.

1394
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,400
 valuation's 50 billion.

1395
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,359
 this is the biggest ham as well that exists.

1396
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,839
 human labor can be automated.

1397
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,040
 and you know are these machines truly generalizable?

1398
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,319
 can they really do anything?

1399
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:45,760
 we don't know.

1400
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,880
 but one of the things we could say that sam alman likes to say about ai

1401
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,240
 for for at least for llms is this is the worst it'll ever be.

1402
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:52,480
 right.

1403
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,000
 and you know that's kind of you know amazing

1404
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,960
 if you think about it

1405
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,280
 now

1406
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:55,839
 we don't

1407
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:56,720
 you know robotics

1408
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,839
 is one of these crapshoots

1409
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,280
 but clearly tesla stock

1410
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,480
 probably about half of it

1411
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,359
 is robotics

1412
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:01,839
 valuation

1413
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:03,040
 and we just trust elon

1414
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:03,839
 and

1415
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,760
 you know he'll he'll he'll figure it out.

1416
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,440
 some people think robotics is a fraud and it's it suffers from too many dimensions

1417
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,880
 of freedom where the machine just won't be able to be like us.

1418
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,599
 i disagree.

1419
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,400
 i think that we have synthetic training data at this point where these machines can actually

1420
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,119
 do anything.

1421
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:19,920
 and i think

1422
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,480
 um

1423
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,040
 various

1424
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,680
 companies including openai and others are going to start betting very heavily and more publicly

1425
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,280
 that robotics is the future.

1426
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,359
 when are we going to see machines out in the wild?

1427
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,920
 when are you going to walk across the street and

1428
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,200
 look look to your left and it's it's a robot walking across the street with you

1429
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:35,760
 or or

1430
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,640
 you know robots

1431
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,760
 going to buy groceries

1432
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,319
 or something.

1433
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:39,119
 it's going to happen.

1434
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,400
 that's the world we're going to live in.

1435
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,160
 i don't know if it's this year or not or or

1436
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,200
 five years or 10 years

1437
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:43,760
 but it's

1438
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,400
 definitively

1439
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,119
 technologically

1440
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,720
 within our capability.

1441
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,079
 and you are talking about one of the biggest sea changes in humanity.

1442
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:51,680
 take think about this.

1443
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,119
 1998

1444
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:55,680
 um elon musk is on a list serve.

1445
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,119
 list serves don't exist anymore.

1446
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,160
 it's a mailing list.

1447
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:58,800
 yeah.

1448
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
 for crypto cipher punks.

1449
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,560
 and if you look through this

1450
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,720
 um mailing list that's fascinating.

1451
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,920
 he's sitting there posting about, you know, this stuff 10 years before satoshi.

1452
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
 and okay, cool.

1453
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,680
 paypal co-founder.

1454
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,880
 he's talking about digital money, trans sending money around the world before anybody's talking about it.

1455
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,920
 tesla, first guy to to autonomous vehicles and and electric vehicles.

1456
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,119
 don't a lot of people forget open ai, he's the co-founder.

1457
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,720
 yeah, he was there too.

1458
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,000
 spacex first guy to do to do satellites cheaply.

1459
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,400
 neuralink, you know, and now robotics.

1460
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,960
 he's telling you this is going to be the biggest thing tesla's ever done.

1461
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,800
 do you do you do you think tesla's overvalued?

1462
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,359
 what's that?

1463
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:44,880
 you think tesla's overvalued?

1464
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,280
 no.

1465
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:45,520
 no.

1466
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,800
 it's like just like palunteer.

1467
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,240
 it's the the tread value guy says, "oh my god, it's such a short.

1468
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:50,960
 it's so obvious.

1469
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,839
 look at the cash flow deteriorating, etc., etc." and it's like, "okay, value the car business.

1470
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,200
 put it aside.

1471
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,119
 now, value the cyber taxi business.

1472
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,200
 put that aside." you know, basically, it's it's old shitty stodgy company.

1473
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:03,920
 that's all it is.

1474
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,800
 sorry, elon.

1475
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,280
 um, that's that's kind of there.

1476
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,200
 and maybe that's worth 200 billion.

1477
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,880
 toyota's worth 200 billion, right?

1478
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,000
 cool.

1479
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,440
 and maybe he can make that grow.

1480
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,160
 i don't know.

1481
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,800
 but that's the conservative assumption.

1482
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,240
 what would the best cyber taxi startup be worth?

1483
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,440
 well, whimo is worth 50, but whimo doesn't have elon.

1484
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,720
 so maybe, and they're not a car company at all, right?

1485
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,760
 so maybe that's 100. so that's robo taxis.

1486
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,960
 now, how about autonomous?

1487
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,319
 it's slightly different

1488
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,920
 um from robo taxis.

1489
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,800
 how about

1490
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,800
 um some of the new cars they're going to make?

1491
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,280
 you have to value each of these as a sort of a separate business.

1492
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,119
 and then finally, robotics you have to value.

1493
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,440
 and robotics, you know, would i pay 500 billion for a robot startup?

1494
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,720
 probably not.

1495
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,760
 but the market is sort of as a sum of parts.

1496
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,599
 i forget the all the parts

1497
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,720
 quite frankly right now,

1498
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,480
 but i did a sum of parts analysis

1499
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:54,960
 and

1500
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,520
 it's sort of fairly valued to me unless robots

1501
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,960
 is even bigger than we think.

1502
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,280
 yeah.

1503
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,480
 which it might be.

1504
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,920
 i mean, that's that's what you're betting on.

1505
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,920
 and if the greatest i mean, i'm t telling you go to 1998.

1506
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,480
 elon's 20some years old and he's posting about cryptocurrency 10 years before it happens.

1507
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,640
 this guy can tell the future.

1508
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,880
 i don't know how, but he can tell the future.

1509
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,359
 and

1510
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,000
 the vcs

1511
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,119
 i talked to, mark andre

1512
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,720
 or peter shield, they all tell you,

1513
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,079
 don't bet against elon.

1514
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,760
 you know, he is the that guy.

1515
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,599
 he can tell that robots is going to be the future.

1516
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,119
 then robots are going to be the future.

1517
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,720
 and you know, how big they're going to get is another question.

1518
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,200
 but conceivably, we could all have a robot each.

1519
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,720
 and again, powered by nvidia.

1520
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,480
 they have to be powered by ai.

1521
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:34,960
 and

1522
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,160
 you know whether tesla uses nvidia or not i don't think is that important because

1523
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:38,640
 as

1524
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,559
 as much as tesla will try they won't have 100%

1525
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,040
 market share right you know there'll be other companies

1526
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,559
 probably tesla will still use nvidia

1527
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,000
 but even if they don't you know the other companies will so you got three huge

1528
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,119
 things that nvidia

1529
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,040
 you basically have to use nvidia

1530
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,559
 to power the future

1531
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,200
 all of the future is based on intelligence

1532
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,480
 being digital

1533
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,160
 and it all has to go through nvidia

1534
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,599
 which is crazy if you think about it

1535
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:00,319
 you know

1536
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,720
 somebody else should be able to make money on this but

1537
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,000
 they just have it locked

1538
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:04,720
 you locked

1539
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,280
 in

1540
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:05,839
 and

1541
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:08,800
 that's why i think nvidia is going to be the first 10 trillion dollar company.

1542
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,160
 do you think elon's attempt at doge was meaningful or it was a waste of time?

1543
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,920
 i think you learned what a lot of people learn.

1544
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,920
 you know, in the hedge fund world, you meet a lot of rich

1545
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,240
 people

1546
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:16,559
 who

1547
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,280
 get bored.

1548
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,280
 i i'd even put vake in that category.

1549
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,319
 i love vake.

1550
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,280
 consider him a friend.

1551
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,000
 but like

1552
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,079
 you sort of, you know, you did your thing in business,

1553
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,400
 you made a lot of money, and you say, "what's

1554
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,400
 next?"

1555
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,240
 and bloomberg did this, etc.

1556
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,880
 what most of these guys find is they step one day

1557
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,200
 in

1558
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,520
 politics

1559
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,160
 and they say, "oh,

1560
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,880
 no, no, no, no.

1561
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,559
 i love this because,

1562
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,240
 you know, and i i i've

1563
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,559
 seen this story play out maybe maybe a hundred times.

1564
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,800
 you know, you make you make however much money,

1565
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,359
 you decide,

1566
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:42,079
 you know, you you

1567
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:42,880
 want to see what politics

1568
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,319
 is like, and you never go back.

1569
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,119
 and 5%

1570
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:45,680
 of those people

1571
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,079
 like it,

1572
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,599
 and they figure it out, and they make it work,

1573
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,319
 you know, the bloombergs

1574
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:48,960
 of the world.

1575
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,880
 but most people say, "this isn't real life.

1576
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,960
 like, i cannot do this, you know, because

1577
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,599
 it is mostly people who are, you know, pretty slimy

1578
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:57,119
 and they're not telling you the truth.

1579
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,000
 they're duplicitous.

1580
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,280
 they're, you know, it's very much an optics game and perception.

1581
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,160
 and you know, you have these slick people that that are not worried about actually executing,

1582
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,599
 which business people do.

1583
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,599
 they're much more worried about, you know, properating their image.

1584
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:11,839
 yeah.

1585
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:12,800
 getting re-elected.

1586
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,040
 yeah.

1587
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,520
 that's it.

1588
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,720
 you know, and that and that's and and i think he learned the hard way.

1589
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,640
 and now it seems like that relationship is fracturing.

1590
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,440
 he said yesterday he was disappointed in trump's budget that that it was so much spending.

1591
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,359
 you know, it seems like they're headed for a divorce.

1592
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:27,520
 but, you know, i think that,

1593
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,359
 you know, trump trump also

1594
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,480
 is such an iconoclass

1595
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,359
 trying to get into the system and change it and even he can't change it.

1596
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,760
 it's so hard to to make that system change.

1597
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,440
 so, business people just get annoyed

1598
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,720
 at this and they realize

1599
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,119
 that

1600
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,599
 you have to think about politics on a 30 40 year time scale.

1601
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,119
 they're used to changing stuff in three or four day.

1602
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,800
 elon's three, four minutes.

1603
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,280
 if you don't respond to me, you're fired, you know.

1604
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,440
 so, i think that, you know, it's not hard.

1605
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,720
 it's not a surprise that he's, you know, sort of saying i

1606
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,319
 i thought i could do x, y, and z.

1607
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,680
 turns out the court stopped me.

1608
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,960
 thought i could do x, y, and z.

1609
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,160
 turns out some republican senator who has a power card to play,

1610
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,359
 you know, uh, can, you know, kill this whole thing.

1611
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,440
 uh, robin hood, vlad tennvive.

1612
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,880
 i bought a lot of call options

1613
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,000
 on the stock when it was $8.

1614
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,240
 it was one of the biggest wins i've had in the market from an options

1615
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,200
 perspective.

1616
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,319
 60 bucks.

1617
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,000
 is robin hood the future of finance?

1618
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,040
 how do you think of this company?

1619
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,440
 i do.

1620
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,960
 i do think it's the future of finance.

1621
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,680
 i compete with them.

1622
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,160
 i talked to vlad about doing something with with my product.

1623
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:24,079
 um, you know, the guy's just a genius.

1624
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:30,000
 you know, he he figured out that there's huge untapped potential in brokerage.

1625
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,720
 um, you know, i can't say i love every single thing he does.

1626
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,599
 you know, i think he he has gified the market a little bit.

1627
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,160
 um, but, you know, i think he's going to build the next big financial institution.

1628
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,000
 you know, i would not be surprised if

1629
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,440
 he built a two-300 billion company that was bigger than goldman sachs.

1630
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:45,680
 wow.

1631
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:51,040
 you know, uh, if you look into vlad's history, um, this isn't guy to bet against.

1632
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,359
 and when you see a guy like this who's

1633
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,200
 him kind of reminds me a little bit of this, too.

1634
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,960
 when you see really talented managers, it took me 25 years to to to

1635
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,839
 of investing and batting beating my head against the wall sometimes

1636
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,040
 to learn some of these lessons.

1637
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,000
 so, i i hope

1638
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,599
 some of you guys will will avoid those 25 years of pain that i had.

1639
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:08,880
 you know, when you see a great manager

1640
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,200
 managing

1641
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,280
 a business and it's just growing and growing,

1642
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,880
 i think you just buy and forget about it and and you just let them compound,

1643
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,960
 especially if they have a big open

1644
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:17,440
 vision.

1645
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,760
 and the big open vision here is

1646
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,480
 finance

1647
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,200
 could be more digital, finance could be more inclusive,

1648
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,760
 finance could look different, and

1649
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,800
 i'm going to make the next goldman sachs or the next jp morgan.

1650
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,680
 and he's doing it.

1651
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,680
 and you just watch and enjoy, you know, like

1652
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,559
 again, you know, is is he going to be a perfect straight lineup?

1653
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,599
 probably not.

1654
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,000
 but, you know, you have to be amazed at this guy.

1655
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,359
 like, and again, i i consider him a rival, you know.

1656
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,200
 so, i i feel like, you know, i'm just amazed at at his abilities.

1657
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,680
 and look at look at his math career if you

1658
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,359
 actually want to be really impressed that the guy isn't just some dope that

1659
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:54,319
 figured it out.

1660
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:59,359
 every guy, i mean, thousands of people have tried to make online brokerages and failed.

1661
00:52:59,359 --> 00:52:59,599
 yeah.

1662
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,960
 you know, this guy did something right.

1663
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,920
 like, same thing with him.

1664
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,079
 every anybody can make like a little tellah health app tomorrow, a little prescription app tomorrow.

1665
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,839
 like you can spin it on up tonight.

1666
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,319
 it's a big difference to make it a 10 billion dollar company.

1667
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:13,599
 and in in robin hood's case, he's at 60 60 billion now.

1668
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,200
 i mean, you have to give credit where credit's due.

1669
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,839
 and and you know, clearly he's he's on to something now.

1670
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:19,359
 does that mean the ride lasts forever?

1671
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,480
 you know, if you look at palanteer,

1672
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,960
 you look at robin hood and you say, "these guys are so good.

1673
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,000
 tesla even,

1674
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,240
 you know, how much can these guys compound

1675
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,000
 and how when will it stop?"

1676
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,720
 and look, the reality is it does stop at some point.

1677
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,760
 ceos get rich.

1678
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,760
 they decide, you know, maybe i'm bored.

1679
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,000
 maybe i'm gonna have 65 kids.

1680
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,400
 maybe.

1681
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,119
 i'm kidding.

1682
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,640
 but maybe, you know, maybe i'm not going to be so interested in this.

1683
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,760
 and one sign

1684
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,880
 if you want to be vicious,

1685
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,680
 and i think sometimes you have to be in this business.

1686
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,119
 vlad started a second company recently.

1687
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,559
 and i had investors

1688
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,240
 a long time ago who said, "martin,

1689
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,960
 if you ever do something like that, we're taking all our money out.

1690
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,000
 if you ever even get a girlfriend or get married,

1691
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,359
 we have a problem

1692
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,760
 because you're supposed to be managing our money,

1693
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,480
 not

1694
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,680
 do you think there could be a symbiotic relationship because it's an ai company.

1695
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,640
 robin is doing ai.

1696
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:09,040
 maybe that's looks like a distraction to me.

1697
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,160
 i mean, he's a mathematician.

1698
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,800
 he loves math.

1699
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,599
 so do i.

1700
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:12,319
 but,

1701
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,599
 you know, if i was

1702
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,640
 seriously ruthless, i'd just be like, what is that [ __ ] yeah.

1703
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,280
 you know, so that's a, you know, he'll probably be fine.

1704
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,720
 but when you look at these telltale signs, like, what are you doing?

1705
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:26,559
 you know, and you just have to watch it carefully because

1706
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,280
 e even the best ceos, they fall off the horse.

1707
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,079
 and

1708
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,480
 you know, when you that's i guess what i'm saying is

1709
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,960
 when you trust and believe so much in the carps

1710
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,760
 and the the musks

1711
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,200
 and the and the tenants,

1712
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,520
 you do have to sit there and sort of say,

1713
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,240
 well,

1714
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,359
 trust but verify.

1715
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:45,359
 you know, i'm gonna i'm gonna i bet on you and i believe in you, but

1716
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:46,800
 you know, watch the quarters,

1717
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,559
 watch the things they do, and if you ever get uncomfortable, just hit the sell button.

1718
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:51,760
 you know, it's not that hard.

1719
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,480
 you know, i think so many the biggest mistake i see individual

1720
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,240
 investors make is they get married.

1721
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,640
 they they just can't ever hit the sell button.

1722
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,119
 we have a guy in our chat, we call named alejandro.

1723
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,440
 we call him bagahandro because he's a bag holder.

1724
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,160
 he's up so much on ion q.

1725
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,119
 he just can't hit sell for some reason.

1726
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,800
 and it's like, look, man, you doubled your money.

1727
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,200
 you're right.

1728
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:11,839
 you licked me.

1729
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:14,319
 i lost two or three million of us.

1730
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,880
 just hit the sell button.

1731
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,960
 you know, it's it's but you know, for whatever

1732
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,440
 reason,

1733
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,319
 every time it goes up, he invents a new reason to belong.

1734
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:22,640
 yeah.

1735
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,400
 and you know, it's it's a symptom that a lot of people have.

1736
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,760
 and there's really there's nothing offending about selling.

1737
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,160
 there's nothing the company doesn't give a [ __ ] about you.

1738
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,680
 you know, you're not you don't get points in the stock market for being loyal.

1739
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,680
 you know, do you get loyalty points?

1740
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,559
 people say they're proud.

1741
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,720
 they say, "i've owned palunteer since this price.

1742
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,559
 i've owned palunteer since this year." you don't get extra stock for that.

1743
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:44,800
 no.

1744
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,280
 no, you don't.

1745
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,760
 alex karp doesn't send you a christmas card for that.

1746
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,280
 your job is to protect your portfolio.

1747
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:50,880
 and if you start to see the

1748
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,960
 i don't know, karp's acting weird and

1749
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,359
 the numbers aren't as good as they thought they'd be,

1750
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:56,240
 you just sell.

1751
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,680
 you know, it's it's not going to kill you.

1752
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,880
 find the next volunteer.

1753
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,559
 you know, a lot of people spend

1754
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,119
 all of their energy on the portfolio they have now.

1755
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:03,440
 yeah.

1756
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,920
 you should be spending a lot of energy on the portfolio

1757
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,280
 of stocks that you don't know about that could be the next

1758
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,920
 palunteer.

1759
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,119
 you know, go worry about, you know, just constantly scrutinizing these stocks.

1760
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:13,920
 you made your bet.

1761
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,599
 already you already have palanteer.

1762
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:16,799
 why study it?

1763
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:17,920
 you know, it doesn't make any sense.

1764
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,520
 you know, keep on tabs on it, but

1765
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:19,760
 you've

1766
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,880
 got to go find the next one and the next one and the next one because

1767
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:22,880
 eventually

1768
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,480
 palanteer will fall off the horse.

1769
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,799
 tesla might and investing is ruthless.

1770
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,640
 you've got to be able to compound and find the next one.

1771
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,240
 i i want to ask you about him, but real quick, sofi,

1772
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,760
 this online bank tech platform,

1773
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,319
 my friend start my friend mike kagy once

1774
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,520
 i was meeting him in san francisco

1775
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,480
 and i i said

1776
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,440
 he was working for paul

1777
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,079
 gaddy,

1778
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,440
 one of the wealthy

1779
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,280
 dynastic families america.

1780
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,319
 and i said, "what are you interested in?" he said, "online banks." and he started sofi.

1781
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:55,119
 and he got kicked out for sexual harassment reasons.

1782
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,119
 that's a i've never i know they went public.

1783
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,799
 they kind of did spack and

1784
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,359
 you know, they seem to have have have gotten things together, but i

1785
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:02,720
 but you don't you don't think of them as competitors

1786
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,920
 to robin hood or anything like that.

1787
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,000
 you don't know what i always call a spade a spade.

1788
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,400
 if i don't know a stock inside and out, i just tell you.

1789
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,119
 got it.

1790
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,760
 okay.

1791
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,880
 hims.

1792
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,319
 you went on the hims house podcast.

1793
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:13,359
 i've been on that podcast.

1794
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:15,359
 there was a big cold falling on this one.

1795
00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:16,720
 are you long hims?

1796
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,760
 i'm not long.

1797
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,760
 i was long on when i was on the podcast.

1798
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,880
 then it [ __ ] like doubled or something like that.

1799
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,680
 i sold it.

1800
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,960
 i even shorted it briefly and

1801
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,240
 i shorted hims and bought palanteer as a pair trade

1802
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,720
 because hims had this like so so quarter and palanteer had this killer quarter.

1803
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:34,960
 yeah.

1804
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,799
 and hims went up 20% on the quarter and palanteer's flat on the quarter.

1805
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,160
 i was like, "hold on, this this is going to reverse." and it reversed.

1806
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,319
 um, you know, so i do trade sometimes.

1807
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,760
 i put the trader hat on,

1808
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,799
 but when i put the investor

1809
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,400
 hat on, i mean, this is obviously a management

1810
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,839
 team that that knows what the hell they're doing.

1811
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:52,799
 i mean, this this tam is also kind of infinite.

1812
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,839
 i mean, healthcare is full of broken [ __ ] to fix.

1813
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,400
 and

1814
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,920
 one of the first broken things to fix was, why can't i just get a prescription

1815
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,359
 for the drug i want?

1816
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:04,799
 and the answer is, well, well, doctors have to decide first.

1817
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,359
 and it's like, well, what the [ __ ] does this doctor know anyway?

1818
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,400
 and the reality is,

1819
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:08,720
 yes,

1820
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,040
 look, i don't i wouldn't want you to do surgery on me,

1821
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,240
 brain surgery on me, amit.

1822
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,760
 but i do think that, you know, i can fill my own prescription for birth control.

1823
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,119
 if you're a woman and you want birth control, what's the big deal?

1824
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,079
 everybody knows.

1825
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,280
 everybody takes these drugs.

1826
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,960
 like, it's really not that serious.

1827
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,920
 cholesterol medicine.

1828
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,200
 i mean, you don't need a doc for every single damn thing.

1829
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,359
 and i think when you go to the doctor,

1830
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:33,440
 it tends to create, oh, well, we have to do a blood draw.

1831
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,720
 oh, well, you know, blood draw had this.

1832
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,079
 well, we're going to have to biopsy that.

1833
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,359
 and it's this constant

1834
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:39,359
 back and forth of you overutilizing

1835
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,400
 health care when the reality is like give me this drug, this drug and this drug

1836
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:42,960
 and

1837
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,240
 that's the way it should be

1838
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,119
 and i feel like

1839
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,799
 you know they have a check and balance there

1840
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:47,760
 in a tele doctor

1841
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:48,079
 checking

1842
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:49,200
 and making sure

1843
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,520
 but the reality is we spend way too much on healthcare.

1844
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,880
 it's bank bankrupting our country and hims is

1845
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,760
 odd as it sounds

1846
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,640
 it's sort of an attempt to sort of fix some of that as well as providing

1847
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,280
 people

1848
00:58:59,280 --> 00:58:59,920
 satisfactory

1849
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,319
 service.

1850
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:02,400
 i hate going to the doctor to renew my script.

1851
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,760
 you know, the doctor

1852
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:04,240
 says,

1853
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,960
 you know, i'm not going to renew the script unless you come in and

1854
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,079
 i want to make sure that,

1855
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,000
 you know, these are the drugs i still want to prescribe.

1856
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,280
 and there's a reason he's doing that.

1857
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,680
 it's not not for, you know, fun or safety.

1858
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,640
 it's because he gets money doing that and he can build his practice up.

1859
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,119
 and,

1860
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,720
 you know, hims is kind of a

1861
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,240
 a challenge to health care system of saying, "yeah, let's do let's do things differently."

1862
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,000
 do you think they have a moat?

1863
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,119
 i don't think you need one.

1864
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,680
 you know, i think that, you know, moat is a funny word.

1865
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,839
 um, i had a bunch of friends at american express who were investors with me that

1866
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:38,160
 um, buffett was a big investor in american express and buffett visited amx

1867
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,000
 and this is like an offthecuff

1868
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,880
 un

1869
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,599
 unrecorded

1870
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,040
 kind of like chat and

1871
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,760
 there buffett's

1872
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,640
 done a lot of these and if you collect little tidbits you hear from people

1873
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,599
 it's kind of fascinating

1874
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,280
 what he's not said publicly.

1875
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,160
 and for for moes he said you guys have a mode but what's a mode?

1876
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,480
 he said moat is when the customer

1877
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,599
 uses a different part of their brain to buy the product, right?

1878
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:00,720
 what does that mean?

1879
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,160
 you know, well, the part of my brain that buys the product when i look at,

1880
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:04,960
 i don't know, a software

1881
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,280
 service,

1882
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,119
 i look at the price and i sort of say, oh,

1883
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:07,839
 is this

1884
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:08,640
 worth it to me?

1885
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,319
 do i want to pay $9.99 a month for this [ __ ] oh, maybe.

1886
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:15,200
 when when you see the gucci hat and you say, i need that.

1887
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:15,359
 yeah.

1888
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,480
 i don't care what the price.

1889
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,040
 what's the price?

1890
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,599
 you're already at the checkout and you look at the price.

1891
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,440
 you know, you you need it.

1892
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,559
 you know, i i i

1893
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,520
 don't care about fashion myself, but you know, the point is, you know,

1894
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,240
 there's a different part of your brain that's that's operating.

1895
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,400
 and i think him it's tricky.

1896
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,400
 you know, on one hand,

1897
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,000
 it's kind of a different part of your brain, but on the other hand,

1898
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:36,559
 it's not.

1899
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,960
 i think that their brand name is is very valuable.

1900
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,640
 people know him, they trust it.

1901
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,240
 but on the other hand, yeah, i mean, somebody else could erode it over time.

1902
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,839
 um, their job is to build it and build it and build it and and and

1903
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:49,280
 get it to a point where

1904
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,880
 nobody can do that and they make a fortress.

1905
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,839
 so far they've done well.

1906
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,599
 there's thousands of these [ __ ] things, right?

1907
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:54,960
 and we know him.

1908
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,160
 there's row.

1909
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:00,079
 but like we don't like it at 55. this is i think it's okay.

1910
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:01,200
 yeah, i think it's okay.

1911
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:01,760
 i i

1912
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,200
 think it's actually kind of cheap, too, because

1913
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,520
 they're

1914
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,000
 actually growing

1915
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,720
 cash flow really

1916
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,359
 fast.

1917
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:09,280
 but all of wall street's really pessimistic because no moat,

1918
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,000
 uh, you know, what's going to happen after glps,

1919
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,359
 uh, etc. but if you just take a step back and say, does this management,

1920
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,480
 they've grown sales.

1921
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,839
 so what's amazing about these kids because they're really really young.

1922
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:21,440
 look at revenue five, six years ago.

1923
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,799
 they barely had any.

1924
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,079
 they have two billion in revenue now.

1925
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:24,400
 yeah.

1926
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,520
 they went from like 50 in revenue to two billion.

1927
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,240
 who does that?

1928
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:28,960
 can you do that?

1929
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,880
 can i do i i've never done that.

1930
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,799
 you know, i i made a $2 billion company.

1931
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,240
 we never we never went from starting start to two billion in revenue.

1932
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,440
 holy moly.

1933
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,559
 you know, who does that?

1934
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:38,960
 you can.

1935
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,960
 it just shows you that this these people know what they're doing.

1936
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,960
 now, again, you got to watch it like a hawk.

1937
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,799
 unlike palunteer and and tesla and and and

1938
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:50,400
 even robin hood maybe the valuation on him is quite reasonable.

1939
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,480
 um the price to cash flow is like 20 times.

1940
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,200
 it's really not, you know, some wild number.

1941
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,240
 now, wall street,

1942
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,880
 the bears on wall street think that cash flow is about to collapse,

1943
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,280
 right?

1944
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,280
 you know, glp and so forth.

1945
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,040
 you know, i i don't know for sure.

1946
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,160
 it does

1947
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,119
 it i i would argue it's just as likely it doubles,

1948
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,640
 but it's one of these stocks that's like i it's tricky.

1949
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,280
 you know, i wish everything were were cut clear,

1950
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,280
 you know, you know, very very clear longs.

1951
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,760
 i mean, it could be rocky if the deal they have with novo

1952
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,119
 is a little complicated.

1953
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,559
 you know, selling glps

1954
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,920
 kind of under the table isn't exactly great business to be in,

1955
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,079
 you know, but they will figure out the next thing

1956
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,079
 and the next thing and the next thing because they're hims.

1957
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:29,599
 they always seem to figure it out.

1958
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,480
 and healthcare is such a big space that, you know, he's literally told you by 2030

1959
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,400
 we're going to be billion six billion.

1960
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,400
 and

1961
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,200
 it's it's not cuz he's guessing, you know, he's got a plan,

1962
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,160
 you know, and and

1963
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,119
 look at the plan.

1964
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:44,799
 imagine being the series a investor.

1965
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:47,440
 kid comes to you and says, "yeah, 50 million valuation.

1966
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,480
 how much business do you have?" "well, a couple million in pharmacy sales."

1967
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,359
 and you're like, "okay,

1968
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,680
 well, we'll see." and then six billion revenue.

1969
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,520
 i mean, unbelievable success.

1970
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,000
 you know, i think he's probably going to beat the six billion.

1971
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,559
 but again, you know, is now the time?

1972
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,680
 is today the time?

1973
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,520
 you know, your strategy wise,

1974
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,319
 it's it's probably a long, you know, i think it probably belongs in most portfolios,

1975
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:08,319
 but

1976
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:09,599
 it's not to say it's riskless.

1977
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,520
 you know, nothing's risk riskless.

1978
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,720
 martin, is tlt the most obvious trade in the market as rates

1979
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,160
 probably have to come down?

1980
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,920
 i'm not a i'm not a macro guy.

1981
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,680
 um, i've never been good at it.

1982
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,920
 you know, it's just not what i do.

1983
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,480
 cool.

1984
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,520
 that's fair.

1985
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,799
 um, okay.

1986
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:25,680
 rapid fire questions.

1987
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,200
 we really appreciate the time, martin.

1988
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,559
 uh, audience loving you.

1989
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,240
 we got 6,000 people here that really

1990
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,720
 appreciate your thoughts, even if they may disagree with you, but

1991
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,680
 you know how to communicate

1992
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,039
 very well about the stock market, and that's because obviously you understand the markets really well.

1993
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,039
 archer, any thoughts on them?

1994
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:40,480
 not really.

1995
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:40,799
 okay.

1996
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,839
 seems like seems bubbleicious.

1997
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:44,400
 okay.

1998
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,000
 rocket lab, any thoughts on them?

1999
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,359
 seems bubbleicious.

2000
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,799
 i i know a lot of people like this one, but man.

2001
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:51,359
 okay.

2002
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:52,720
 not for me.

2003
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:56,400
 have you looked at grab ever by any chance?

2004
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,359
 not really.

2005
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,240
 okay.

2006
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,200
 um, micro strategy, bitcoin, general thoughts.

2007
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,319
 does this explode?

2008
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:07,680
 yeah, i i so one of my big habies is cracking bitcoin, trying to

2009
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,640
 um it's led me to down a lot of really interesting roads.

2010
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,920
 um i have a github repo on on some of my work.

2011
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,079
 i'll update later today.

2012
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,280
 i think satoshi's

2013
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,280
 tokens

2014
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,559
 on the p this is very technical

2015
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:22,559
 p2pk

2016
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,480
 script the original p2pk not p2pkh

2017
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,319
 or taproot or segwit

2018
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:32,400
 those tokens which are about 9% of bitcoin they will be hacked

2019
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,079
 now whether it's me that does it or not we'll see but wait

2020
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,359
 why why are you so confident that they're going to be hacked the public key

2021
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:40,240
 is

2022
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,640
 is shown on those tokens

2023
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,760
 you need to calculate which is impossible most people okay.

2024
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,400
 and normally 99% of me agrees.

2025
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,039
 1% we're going to try.

2026
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,119
 the public key of the ecc curve 256 bits.

2027
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,720
 so it's 256 ones and zeros or about 77 digits.

2028
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,680
 that public key matches a 77digit private key.

2029
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,720
 if you guess this private key, you win.

2030
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:08,880
 every other bitcoin, the other 91%, they don't show you the private key.

2031
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,079
 so you don't even know what the number is to guess.

2032
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:13,920
 but you have the number here.

2033
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,799
 you just don't know how to go from one way to the other.

2034
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,839
 now, it's very hard.

2035
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:20,400
 but quantum computers can do this very easily.

2036
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,520
 there's no such thing as a quantum computer yet that can do it.

2037
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:24,480
 but,

2038
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,640
 you know, in 10 years when we can do this magic number trick, we can

2039
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,440
 we can

2040
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,680
 turn this one number to this other number.

2041
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,039
 that's the one thing i do concede quantum computers could do.

2042
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,240
 again, don't know if it's 10 years.

2043
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,520
 don't know if it's 20 or 30. but no matter what,

2044
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,440
 the people at the bitcoin foundation

2045
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,760
 and who control the the github repo,

2046
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,160
 no matter what they do, they cannot

2047
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,160
 stop these tokens unless they blacklist them, which they can do, right?

2048
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,280
 that's the only saving grace.

2049
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,520
 they can say, "we're deleting satoshi's tokens.

2050
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,640
 he's dead."

2051
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,400
 the problem with that is that

2052
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,240
 what does it say to the rest of the bitcoin market?

2053
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:58,880
 yeah.

2054
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,079
 you know, it's like maybe you could delete your tokens, too.

2055
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,280
 and i don't think that's good.

2056
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,880
 so, if they leave satoshi's tokens there, it's nine nine% of the supply.

2057
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,039
 that's inevitably going somewhere.

2058
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,319
 probably the the first guy with a quantum computer that figures it out.

2059
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:16,240
 maybe the guy that's using all the quantum computer time on the clouds right now.

2060
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:19,119
 but regardless, you know, it'll be

2061
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,400
 um it'll be cracked someday.

2062
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,079
 i think that is is very obvious.

2063
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,839
 even the people kneede in this on the bitcoin board or bitcoin community acknowledge this.

2064
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,400
 and

2065
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,680
 i don't know what you do about imagine

2066
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,920
 you had you knew you had a stock where you knew 9%

2067
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,359
 of the stock was going to be sold,

2068
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:34,640
 right?

2069
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,280
 it could be one of these things where you say, "well, if they sell it,

2070
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,400
 they sell it in an orderly

2071
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,400
 way

2072
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,720
 or maybe they burn it, right?"

2073
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,200
 you know, they

2074
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:43,920
 could do it in a,

2075
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,880
 you know, if they burned it, they'd

2076
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,200
 be burning

2077
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:45,520
 hundred

2078
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,200
 billion

2079
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:47,200
 dollars.

2080
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,079
 who wants do you think bitcoin is a hedge against money printing?

2081
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:51,119
 do you believe in that?

2082
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:51,680
 yeah.

2083
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,480
 yeah, it is.

2084
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,559
 you know, it's and i hate to say it because

2085
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,559
 i thought trump was going to be

2086
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,799
 a bearish thing for bitcoin

2087
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:01,920
 because trump was supposed to

2088
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,039
 um basically bitcoin is an asset that was born in crisis in the blockchain.

2089
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,440
 inscribed in it is the financial crisis, right?

2090
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,200
 it's a it's the newspaper of the banks failing, right?

2091
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,599
 and satoshi was clearly telling you in in only so many words that

2092
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,319
 how do you trust people to organize the monetary system?

2093
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:20,880
 you can't.

2094
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:21,839
 they're going to print money.

2095
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:23,200
 they're going to do political things.

2096
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,400
 we need something that we that is beyond the aocc's

2097
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,359
 and even the quite frankly sometimes the trumps of the world.

2098
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:32,319
 if they're going to print all this money, we need something something else.

2099
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:33,359
 so he told you that.

2100
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,520
 so trump was supposed to come in, cut the deficit,

2101
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,280
 cut the spending, cut the [ __ ]

2102
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,280
 and

2103
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,280
 also

2104
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:45,680
 bitcoin was born in crisis in a time of invasion of privacy and censorship and anti-moneylaundering

2105
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:49,039
 laws and know your client laws and all this stuff that gums the financial system.

2106
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:50,319
 bitcoin doesn't have any of that.

2107
01:07:50,319 --> 01:07:53,680
 so trump was supposed to cut that, stop the surveillance state.

2108
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,200
 none of that's happening, you know.

2109
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,039
 so bitcoin is still needed.

2110
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,480
 you know, you're still being censored.

2111
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,240
 people are still being kicked out of bank accounts.

2112
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,520
 inflation is rampant.

2113
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,039
 the need for bitcoin still exists.

2114
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,480
 i thought trump would come in and people would say, "well, why do we need cryptocurrency?

2115
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,680
 what good is it for?

2116
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,960
 i the government's not spying on me anymore.

2117
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,079
 inflation's been tamed.

2118
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:13,599
 we've tamed that beast, right?

2119
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:17,920
 budgets budget's going back to normal." but no, actually things seem like they're worse.

2120
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,479
 you know, it seems like the us is going to go bankrupt.

2121
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,198
 it seems like inflation isn't going anywhere.

2122
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:26,238
 it seems like civil liberties, look, i'm a republican, but

2123
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:28,399
 you know, you have to throw spade

2124
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:28,880
 a spade.

2125
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,640
 trump's not exactly, you know, mr.

2126
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,279
 civil liberties.

2127
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,799
 i mean, he is taking people and chucking them out of the country.

2128
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,520
 so, you know, whether what team you're on depends,

2129
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:38,799
 but right now the democrats

2130
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:42,158
 are looking at it saying, "we feel he's a fascist." now, i don't agree.

2131
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,279
 but when the democrats were in charge, i said, "well, i think they're a fascist."

2132
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,279
 you know, so we're none of nobody's tamping it down and saying, "all right, let's all

2133
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,640
 kind of calm down."

2134
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,399
 you

2135
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:52,399
 know,

2136
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,158
 it's the country is sort of a [ __ ] show.

2137
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:54,719
 so

2138
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,319
 that's the kind of time where you want bitcoin because if we have to reorder

2139
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,479
 the entire financial system of the world,

2140
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:02,000
 as as much as i think bitcoin's

2141
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,520
 kind of silly,

2142
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,880
 it's a good place to start

2143
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,080
 if you are going to reorder

2144
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:06,640
 the financial

2145
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,799
 system of the world, it is widely distributed

2146
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:09,679
 already.

2147
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,120
 you know,

2148
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,000
 again, it's just a it's just a little crappy database,

2149
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,560
 and i could spin one up now right on my terminal.

2150
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,560
 would you want to buy a piece of my little crappy database?

2151
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,198
 no.

2152
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:24,640
 uh, did you own a decent chunk of bitcoin or no [music] comment?

2153
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,560
 uh, amd thoughts on amd?

2154
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:27,000
 don't know.

2155
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,399
 well, don't know.

2156
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:29,439
 well, okay.

2157
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:35,000
 um, here's an interesting one that i think is is is really a funny one.

2158
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,799
 uh, apple, it's a tough one.

2159
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:42,560
 you know, it, you know, he's a very different kind of manager, cook.

2160
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:49,000
 um, he's sort of this like ruthless executor, but the company's lost its magic, obviously.

2161
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,560
 um, it's also, it's probably one of these stocks where there's nothing to do, you know?

2162
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:56,920
 i could they make something big work?

2163
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:57,920
 yes.

2164
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,440
 you know, is ai going to lift their boat just because?

2165
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,080
 yeah.

2166
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,360
 they're really good at chips.

2167
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,199
 you know, that's the one thing that's super impressive about them.

2168
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:06,560
 you know, it's shocking.

2169
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,840
 you never would have thought, you know, they'd be this good at at chips.

2170
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,480
 and that's kind of one of the things that could save them.

2171
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,360
 but it does feel like apple's tired.

2172
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,040
 it's just as tired as microsoft was at the microsoft peak where it was like

2173
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,159
 people didn't like

2174
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,239
 the evil empire microsoft and,

2175
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,000
 you know, at least on the consumer side.

2176
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,080
 and do you think apple could be a healthcare play in a real way?

2177
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:28,960
 no.

2178
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:29,920
 they don't have the focus.

2179
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,800
 you know, they, you know, to be really good at this,

2180
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,719
 you need somebody who's just a killer executive that's going to be really well compensated

2181
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,280
 and is going to smash through the smash everything.

2182
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:43,040
 and these bigger companies, they they're just too deeified

2183
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,000
 and like you can't make something like that work at apple.

2184
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
 i think it has to come from outside,

2185
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,199
 you know, and you can see they

2186
01:10:49,199 --> 01:10:50,000
 what have they innovated

2187
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,320
 on,

2188
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,040
 you know, they they

2189
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:51,360
 flopped

2190
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:51,840
 on vision

2191
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,400
 pro,

2192
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:52,960
 airpods

2193
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,080
 is okay,

2194
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,440
 but, you know, in general, this company hasn't done something new in 20 years almost.

2195
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,360
 do do you think xrp is a scam?

2196
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,800
 i do.

2197
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,159
 why?

2198
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:04,719
 doesn't do anything.

2199
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,159
 nobody is, you know.

2200
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:12,560
 i think that bitcoin is a lot like that too, but it's more lindy for one.

2201
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,560
 you know, there's a greater, you know, it's a widely distributed thing.

2202
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,960
 i i have a friend who owns over a billion dollars of bitcoin,

2203
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,640
 and he's a famous entrepreneur.

2204
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,719
 you actually mentioned his name in this podcast at one point,

2205
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:29,199
 and you know, he said, "martin, i know bitcoin's [ __ ]

2206
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,760
 but it it's [ __ ] enough people believe.

2207
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,840
 and i don't disagree.

2208
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,520
 you know, i i love bitcoin in one part of my mind.

2209
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,360
 in the other part of my mind, i agree with warren buffett.

2210
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,239
 i mean, what the [ __ ] is it?

2211
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:40,800
 it's nothing.

2212
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:44,239
 it's like old crappy database, hard to update, hard to maintain.

2213
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,280
 and i think one of the bearish

2214
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,000
 things for bitcoin,

2215
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,480
 just just

2216
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,000
 to put a bone on this is interesting,

2217
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,679
 is when people figure out

2218
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:50,960
 that those satoshi

2219
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,520
 tokens are gone, it's a big bearish catalyst because

2220
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,440
 it's not so much that the tokens get sold.

2221
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,440
 yes, they might cause a panic sale or whatever.

2222
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,800
 it'll bounce back from that.

2223
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,360
 you know, even

2224
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,719
 even if they sell it to a dollar,

2225
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:02,640
 they're going to walk it right back up.

2226
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,600
 the bigger problem is that satoshi is the mythology.

2227
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,640
 the mythos of bitcoin is a big part of it.

2228
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,480
 here's this mystery man that drops money, the new money on us and disappears.

2229
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,320
 he doesn't even sell his own tokens.

2230
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:17,520
 he just drops a hundred billion too and says, "i don't need it." right?

2231
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,159
 maybe he's dead.

2232
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,120
 maybe he's not.

2233
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,360
 point is when

2234
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,640
 elliptic curve cryptography and shor's algorithm that cracks it that existed at the time.

2235
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,000
 satoshi wrote bitcoin.

2236
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,040
 shor's algorithm comes go back back to 90s.

2237
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:37,920
 he should have known this was a problem and he he left these bitcoin there anyway.

2238
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,719
 so the more we crack the satoshi myth

2239
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,640
 that he was this mythological god

2240
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,679
 and more realize that he was just a dude he was a programmer

2241
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:47,040
 who made mistakes

2242
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,679
 that maybe it becomes one of these things that was like

2243
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,760
 why are we all kind of like

2244
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,480
 you know putting

2245
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:52,800
 trillions

2246
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,840
 of dollars in the whole financial

2247
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,280
 system on this code that we can't update

2248
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,000
 that has flaws

2249
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,320
 and

2250
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,360
 what happens if another

2251
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,239
 computer

2252
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,480
 a probabilistic computer a thermodynamic

2253
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,360
 computer

2254
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:01,760
 whatever

2255
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,480
 kind of computer

2256
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:04,159
 we don't even think about what if that cracks

2257
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,520
 the rest of the 91%

2258
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,080
 of bitcoin what do we do then yeah you know do we censor

2259
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,679
 the the bitcoin we don't like.

2260
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,560
 you know, it's it's not the perfect system at all.

2261
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,880
 and you know, but it's hard to crack the the the the mythology of it.

2262
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,679
 you know, the that's what keeps a a bunch of it going.

2263
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:22,000
 that's what keeps the people evangelizing it.

2264
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,080
 the crazy people i think i think sellers nuts.

2265
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,239
 i mean, i think he's basically manic.

2266
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,520
 i think he's not sober in terms of his attitude.

2267
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,040
 i don't know about his personal life.

2268
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,679
 um but he he just is so drunk on bitcoin.

2269
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,520
 um he what you call drunk people would call conviction.

2270
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,880
 no i i mean i have conviction on stuff you know but

2271
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,080
 i think that

2272
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:47,440
 you part of conviction is acknowledging you know the the downside

2273
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,159
 and

2274
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,719
 you know there's always there's no perfect investment

2275
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:51,520
 and

2276
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:53,920
 you know i think it's really disingenuous

2277
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,600
 for him

2278
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,560
 to

2279
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,159
 tell you tell the people that there's no late time to buy bitcoin.

2280
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,920
 the 100,000x is over man.

2281
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,440
 we're never getting that again.

2282
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,400
 you know, if bitcoin took over the entire financial system, it's maybe a 10x.

2283
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,320
 so, you know, it's a bit silly to sort of say,

2284
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,640
 you know, oh, you're, you know, you got to get in bitcoin.

2285
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,520
 well, you're trying to

2286
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,880
 get people to mark up your position

2287
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,320
 is what you're trying to do.

2288
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,480
 and you don't see him sitting there

2289
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,920
 saying, let's put bitcoin in payments because it can't be used in payments.

2290
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:24,480
 yeah.

2291
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,440
 you know, he's not, you know, so to me, i think i think sailor's

2292
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,640
 a bit of a charlatan.

2293
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,400
 you know, again, i i appreciate his evangelism of bitcoin, but

2294
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,679
 it seems like

2295
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:37,040
 this is more of a pump and dump for him than not and not a dump.

2296
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,800
 just a pump and pump

2297
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,960
 um you know, for him more than it is anything else.

2298
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,760
 all right.

2299
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,040
 some people are okay with that.

2300
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,560
 some people want a pump and pump.

2301
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,440
 well, it's trading at almost 2x now, so i guess so.

2302
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:49,920
 absolute

2303
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,800
 last question for you, martin, and i just want you to give us the goodell pitch.

2304
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,440
 here's the question.

2305
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,080
 meta, google, amazon, nvidia, tesla, microsoft, apple.

2306
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,360
 if you have to pick one mac 7 over the next decade,

2307
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:00,880
 what is the one you go long on?

2308
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,960
 and you can't own the other six.

2309
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,960
 okay, so definitely not apple.

2310
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,880
 um, probably not google.

2311
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,640
 um, i want to put meta and nvidia on the maybe side.

2312
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:15,920
 probably not amazon.

2313
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,960
 do i got them all?

2314
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:17,840
 microsoft?

2315
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,719
 probably not microsoft.

2316
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,400
 so, it's it's between meta and nvidia.

2317
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:22,960
 nvidia.

2318
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,800
 so, you have a lot of respect for zucks.

2319
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:25,679
 i do.

2320
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:27,520
 i think he's the beast.

2321
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,199
 i was talking to baron trump about baron was like glazing elon.

2322
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,800
 he was like, "ah, you learn the best."

2323
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,360
 and i said, "don't

2324
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,239
 don't sleep on zuck."

2325
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:34,719
 he's like, "ah,

2326
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:36,400
 no, no, we don't." i said, "don't

2327
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,360
 sleep on zuck."

2328
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,239
 you know, he's

2329
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:40,640
 he's just as good as elon or better.

2330
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,480
 you know, he is

2331
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:48,159
 he's the absolute unit and you know, we don't know what zuck has planned for us

2332
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:52,000
 anytime soon, but you know, there's he's got this he's got a bunch of cool stuff.

2333
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,520
 i know whi- which part of it and what will work i don't know

2334
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:58,560
 but he's still young and he's still hungry and

2335
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,520
 it's clear he's he's one of the best ever

2336
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,000
 what about tesla is tesla on that list of

2337
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,239
 no

2338
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:11,360
 it's just that okay i'll tell you really quick story so

2339
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,040
 there was a guy named alman he passed away

2340
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:21,679
 he created the the first insulin pump and then the first coclear implant brilliant guy

2341
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:23,120
 um made billions.

2342
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,280
 then he made he was making the first inhaled insulin

2343
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,960
 and this was like early in my career.

2344
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,159
 i i i fought him.

2345
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:30,560
 he almost actually physically tried to beat me up.

2346
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:31,840
 he was 82.

2347
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,360
 um it was that bad.

2348
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,840
 the short versus the founder, right?

2349
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,280
 and al man, he's like, "don't you know who i am?

2350
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,159
 i'm this guy, that guy." he was the elon musk of medtech.

2351
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:45,600
 and his last gasp was to do inhaled insulin.

2352
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,159
 he was wrong.

2353
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:46,800
 i was right.

2354
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,520
 i took him down.

2355
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:52,320
 he forever blamed me for beating his company up and defeating it.

2356
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,560
 he died having wasted his last few billions on this on this dream.

2357
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,679
 in the scheme of things, the guy was a brilliant guy and a wonderful guy.

2358
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,280
 but he also,

2359
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:05,679
 you know, for whatever reason decided to put all of his money behind a bad idea.

2360
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:07,040
 i can't

2361
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:07,360
 for

2362
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:07,679
 certain

2363
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:08,320
 say if elon's

2364
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,120
 going to be right or wrong,

2365
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,840
 and that's the mystery

2366
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,480
 of the markets.

2367
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:10,960
 right.

2368
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:11,280
 right.

2369
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,560
 you know, on one hand, i i think he's probably going to be right,

2370
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:20,000
 but on the other hand, nvidia gets paid if he's right,

2371
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,960
 and nvidia kind of gets paid no matter what.

2372
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:25,199
 so, we don't know.

2373
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:28,000
 you just don't know if if you're about to be the next alam man.

2374
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,280
 there are people that

2375
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,199
 their first company works, the second company works, third company works, fourth company makes them broke.

2376
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,560
 it happens all the time.

2377
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,000
 i'm not saying that's going to happen to elon.

2378
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,239
 i think he's great, but i don't know him.

2379
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:39,920
 i don't i don't sit down with him every day.

2380
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,920
 i don't i don't know what he's doing dayto-day.

2381
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,760
 i don't know if he's lost his mind or not.

2382
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:44,400
 no clue.

2383
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,280
 do you?

2384
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,480
 no, we don't know.

2385
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:46,719
 so,

2386
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:46,960
 we

2387
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,199
 only

2388
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:47,760
 can watch what

2389
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,159
 he's doing

2390
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,400
 and

2391
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:48,960
 we don't even

2392
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,199
 there

2393
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:49,760
 we just get

2394
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:50,320
 imperfect

2395
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,280
 information,

2396
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:51,679
 you know.

2397
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:53,440
 so, it it you're betting big.

2398
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,480
 basically, half a tesla is this leverage bet on robotics.

2399
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:58,159
 i don't know if the future is going to be robotics.

2400
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,920
 he's telling you it's going to be.

2401
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,960
 but again, al man told me inhaled insulin was going to be the biggest thing ever.

2402
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,760
 nobody was going to inject insulin ever again, right?

2403
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,040
 you know, i i said no.

2404
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:07,920
 and i was right.

2405
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,199
 and you know, the guy had billions of dollars, i had millions of dollars.

2406
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,840
 and you know, some of his money became my money.

2407
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,360
 and it's one of these things where, you know, i just

2408
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,080
 it's,

2409
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,320
 you know, you just because there's a big upside

2410
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,159
 potential risk doesn't mean you have to take it.

2411
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:23,520
 you know, you can still respect.

2412
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,960
 i mean, he's probably going to do it.

2413
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,000
 he's probably going to do it.

2414
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,560
 but i'd like to if i can get my cake and eat it, too.

2415
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,840
 so, if i can see the robots

2416
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,480
 coming out,

2417
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,800
 right, and revenues grow and then i can buy

2418
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,000
 and if the price,

2419
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:34,880
 if the market blesses

2420
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,080
 me by giving me the opportunity

2421
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:36,480
 to

2422
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,679
 still buy at a good price,

2423
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:38,800
 then i'm all in,

2424
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,280
 right?

2425
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:42,400
 but, you know, sometimes the market, mr.

2426
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,640
 market shouts at you a really good price.

2427
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,679
 and sometimes he doesn't.

2428
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:47,520
 i may never get that chance on tesla,

2429
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,040
 but the stars just might align where the robots,

2430
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,040
 like, let's say people start losing faith in us.

2431
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,800
 the robots aren't coming.

2432
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,360
 you know,

2433
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,719
 [ __ ] the robot and tesla revenue

2434
01:18:56,719 --> 01:18:58,320
 is down for the auto and there's a big crisis.

2435
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,920
 he's got a margin call,

2436
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,320
 whatever it is, and you could buy tesla for 10 times earnings in a recession

2437
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:07,760
 and then you see that the robots are coming and you see it is real.

2438
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:08,960
 then you go all in, right?

2439
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,080
 so like

2440
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,880
 now this price at this risk profile,

2441
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,840
 i i still would be long, but in that paniply

2442
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,280
 of companies, you know, maybe nvidia

2443
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,080
 better,

2444
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:18,400
 right?

2445
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,440
 you know, maybe i'd say tesla's number three.

2446
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:27,280
 so, i i put nvidia, uh, meta, and then, uh, then tesla,

2447
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:32,880
 and then maybe microsoft, um, and then amazon, and then apple,

2448
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,239
 but yeah, we'll see.

2449
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:34,960
 it's hard to tell.

2450
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,679
 these are the most looked at stocks in the world.

2451
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,640
 and you can sort of basically assume that their valuations are relatively right, right?

2452
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,280
 you know,

2453
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:46,719
 at the given moment, everyone in the world is analyzing them and markets are

2454
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:47,600
 machines that work.

2455
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,640
 you know,

2456
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,199
 you know,

2457
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:51,679
 there may be changes that we don't know about, but once those changes

2458
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:52,239
 are made,

2459
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,920
 we're made aware of them, the markets will adjust.

2460
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,120
 and i believe in the markets.

2461
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,560
 you know, i don't think they always work.

2462
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,080
 otherwise, we wouldn't have jobs, right?

2463
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,679
 but i think 90% of the time they work.

2464
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,840
 so, it's it's a little bit difficult to tell the future on those.

2465
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,679
 martin, we really appreciate your time.

2466
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:06,560
 there's martin's twitter.

2467
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,199
 i mean, my audience has absolutely loved this and enjoyed it.

2468
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:09,679
 thanks so much.

2469
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,040
 if i can plug my thing real quick.

2470
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:11,199
 yeah.

2471
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:11,360
 yeah.

2472
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,480
 so, this is so this is what i'm going to do.

2473
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,040
 so, goodell.

2474
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,239
 so, dude, so i'm going to be honest.

2475
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:16,800
 i still pay for this every month, but i don't use it.

2476
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,840
 and that's more of a me thing.

2477
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,280
 i just like force of habit.

2478
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,840
 i haven't been using it, but i saw it in january.

2479
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,520
 it's a bloomberg

2480
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,880
 terminal competitor and and you know, i've se i've been familiar with your brand.

2481
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,440
 so, i i i

2482
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,800
 paid for it and i just need to

2483
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,159
 start using a lot more.

2484
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:30,880
 what is it?

2485
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:32,480
 why are you trying to compete against bloomberg

2486
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:32,800
 and

2487
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:35,199
 you know, you went some you went through some stuff over the past decade,

2488
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:35,840
 went to prison,

2489
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,400
 came back.

2490
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,080
 why is this the next big idea?

2491
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,239
 yeah.

2492
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:40,719
 so, i've been involved in financial software my whole life.

2493
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:42,800
 i i actually was a software guy,

2494
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,000
 you know, for most of my life before i i did pharma very seriously.

2495
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,360
 i was a programmer growing up.

2496
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,560
 i love software.

2497
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,760
 um, so if you know the bloomberg terminal, it's really efficient.

2498
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,520
 it is hard to use and hard to learn.

2499
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,560
 the average person doesn't know how to use a bloomberg terminal, but we made a backwards

2500
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,600
 compatible version.

2501
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,520
 so if you know bloomberg, you know god, and if you learn goodell,

2502
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,800
 you learn bloomberg, right?

2503
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,280
 so the key to it is pressing the the the

2504
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,760
 button on top of your tab, the the back tick button.

2505
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,080
 yeah.

2506
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:09,199
 so when you press that button,

2507
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,280
 we actually made this thing so you're not supposed to use your mouse.

2508
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,560
 just throw your mouse away.

2509
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,719
 and now type hit the back tick and type pltr and hit enter.

2510
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:17,920
 and and that's sort of how it works.

2511
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,640
 now type hds and hit enter.

2512
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,239
 ah, you used your mouse.

2513
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:24,719
 oh, you're right.

2514
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:25,040
 you're right.

2515
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:30,000
 i did those little press escape twice.

2516
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:30,800
 wow.

2517
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,560
 now type n.

2518
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,280
 that's news, right?

2519
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:33,600
 yeah.

2520
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,239
 and hit enter.

2521
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:34,480
 yeah.

2522
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,159
 this is the most comprehensive news.

2523
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,600
 no ads in the news.

2524
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,960
 no ads anywhere in our platform.

2525
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:39,920
 the most comprehensive news.

2526
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:42,719
 in fact, there are more stories on our platform than there are on bloomberg,

2527
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,800
 which is something that we worked really hard to get.

2528
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:49,280
 so, it's not quite bloomberg yet, but it is also 95% cheaper than bloomberg.

2529
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,800
 so, you know, i always wondered why bloomberg was so expensive.

2530
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,639
 and, you know, i love programming

2531
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:55,199
 and

2532
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,440
 i also think that one of the the biggest things that

2533
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:57,760
 that's

2534
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,880
 problem out there is that nobody

2535
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,600
 can quantitatively

2536
01:21:59,600 --> 01:21:59,920
 invest.

2537
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,400
 and i kind of want to build that for people.

2538
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,239
 i also have a lot of social features in there.

2539
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:07,199
 so, there's chat rooms and all kinds of stuff that's fun.

2540
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:10,159
 so, you know, robin just got out of the hood was a funny one.

2541
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:13,360
 uh, how are you charge 60 bucks a month for this?

2542
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,639
 like, that seems pretty cheap.

2543
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,600
 well, it's also free, so you can actually just mess around with it for free.

2544
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,120
 and that's something a lot of people don't know.

2545
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,880
 and we have we have thousands and thousands of users, uh, tens of thousands of users.

2546
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,600
 and, um, we still haven't even publicly announced it.

2547
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,280
 so, i haven't tweeted about it yet.

2548
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:30,560
 so, it's still kind of like early early days and under apps.

2549
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,600
 and we're going to hopefully do um, we're adding bonds to it.

2550
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,480
 we're adding, you know, it's going to be the full feature of bloomberg.

2551
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,600
 ready to take them down.

2552
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,840
 i i just honestly hate bloomberg.

2553
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,239
 they they banned me from their product.

2554
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:48,080
 i've been i was a user since i was 17. they're very political organization.

2555
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,480
 they have a news team that hates me.

2556
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,120
 it's become personal, you know, for for whatever reason.

2557
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:54,320
 this is personal.

2558
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,960
 mike is one of the rich some people, a lot of people don't know this.

2559
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,800
 mike bloomberg may be the richest man in the world.

2560
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,199
 yeah.

2561
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:03,199
 and it's it's you know, the the forbes people have finally figured this out.

2562
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,040
 he's like number seven or something.

2563
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,960
 but people just don't know how rich he is.

2564
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,760
 i would guess about 400 500 billion.

2565
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:15,760
 so forb says 104, but you think it's even just bloomberg alone is worth 200. yeah.

2566
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:16,480
 so

2567
01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:18,159
 and then the funny thing about bloomberg

2568
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,520
 is every year he pays himself a dividend of 5 to 10 billion

2569
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,480
 for the last of it of it

2570
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,760
 for the last 40 years.

2571
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,120
 that's probably why they haven't gone public, right?

2572
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:29,600
 they enjoy.

2573
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,800
 and what does he do with the money?

2574
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,239
 does he just throw it away?

2575
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,600
 no, he's been investing it and making 20% on that money.

2576
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:39,440
 the guy might have a trillion dollars for all we know.

2577
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,639
 it's kind of nuts.

2578
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:41,199
 do you think this

2579
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:42,239
 could you could sell this to to

2580
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:42,480
 hedge

2581
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,440
 funds and they could use this over

2582
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:43,840
 bloomberg?

2583
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,480
 yeah, we're mostly going to target, you know, uh, wall street,

2584
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,639
 but i also think that if you look at aws,

2585
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,560
 kind of my vision here is like, all right, bloomberg,

2586
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:52,880
 you can't even go on bloomberg right now and and

2587
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,159
 even if you're a billionaire,

2588
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:57,679
 you can't slap your amx down and say, "give me that thing." you can't.

2589
01:23:57,679 --> 01:23:59,040
 and if you're broke, forget it.

2590
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,679
 you know, if you have less than 10 million, yeah, don't even bother.

2591
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:02,960
 um it's it's just not worth it.

2592
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,520
 it's 30 grand a year.

2593
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,520
 so

2594
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,400
 aws,

2595
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,480
 when you jump on amazon web services,

2596
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:11,840
 it doesn't matter if you're netflix and you're paying them five bill a year,

2597
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,199
 you're our company and maybe you're paying them 100 grand a year or if you're hobbyist

2598
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:16,560
 and you're paying them nothing a year.

2599
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,960
 they want you no matter what because it's the best system.

2600
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,920
 i'm the same way.

2601
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:22,159
 if you you don't want to pay this thing, don't pay it.

2602
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:22,880
 you know, it's fine.

2603
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:23,760
 i'm not going to show you.

2604
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,000
 i'm

2605
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,719
 not going to give you the

2606
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:25,040
 stuff that

2607
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:25,280
 cost

2608
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,000
 me a lot of money

2609
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:26,239
 and

2610
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:26,800
 i'm going to lose

2611
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,040
 tons

2612
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:27,760
 of money on you,

2613
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,159
 but i'm

2614
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:28,960
 give you some stuff and

2615
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,199
 i'm

2616
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,639
 probably going to lose a little bit of money on you.

2617
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:32,400
 and if you pay me, i'm gonna give you the world.

2618
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,800
 and that's, you know, kind of the way we we do this.

2619
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,199
 and it's early days, but you know, i'm excited.

2620
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,080
 why was this the big idea?

2621
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,159
 why were you so excited to to start this?

2622
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:40,320
 yeah.

2623
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,400
 i think that financial software hasn't changed.

2624
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,440
 you know, so bloomberg hasn't changed in 15 years.

2625
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,600
 and the sad thing is

2626
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:52,239
 most people wouldn't know this, but the quantitative world has completely changed wall street.

2627
01:24:52,239 --> 01:24:53,920
 the average guy in wall street

2628
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:54,880
 30 years ago

2629
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,239
 was a cigar chomping

2630
01:24:56,239 --> 01:25:00,719
 frat boy with a famous last name like kennedy or something that went to yale.

2631
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:05,440
 the average guy on wall street now is a chinese programmer who won a math contest.

2632
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,679
 and it is a very different world.

2633
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:08,800
 and why is that?

2634
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,280
 well, markets are very technical and efficient.

2635
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,520
 and the top 10 hedge funds on it,

2636
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:16,320
 they used to be all stock pickers and and and

2637
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,920
 you know, macro pickers.

2638
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,159
 of the top 10 head 10 head 10 hedge funds now nine are quants

2639
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,760
 nine out of 10

2640
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,080
 the the whole market's mathematical

2641
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,760
 i wouldn't say it's rigged

2642
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,280
 because that's not the right word

2643
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:29,760
 but

2644
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:30,080
 if

2645
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,120
 you're trying to trade

2646
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:31,440
 out

2647
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:32,000
 trade people

2648
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,320
 it's

2649
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:32,960
 i mean it's

2650
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:33,520
 really tricky

2651
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,639
 i mean these firms are making

2652
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:35,440
 20 30 billion

2653
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,239
 a year

2654
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,800
 and you're paying them we're paying them when when we trade

2655
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,040
 and i i want to make systems that

2656
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:41,679
 can

2657
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:42,080
 at least

2658
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,480
 show you some of this and compete on it and like

2659
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,560
 the the best tools right now like bloomberg

2660
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,760
 they don't have any tools like that and they don't really help you very much.

2661
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,800
 so, we're going to try to cater to a more modern audience

2662
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:55,440
 that knows how to program, that's more technical,

2663
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,920
 that really wants to make money by any means necessary,

2664
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:58,960
 like not gambling

2665
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,800
 on whether or not a stock might go up, but

2666
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:01,840
 really having a system

2667
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:02,400
 that that

2668
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,280
 will make them money.

2669
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,800
 and it's a group of people that are really smart.

2670
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:11,320
 so, if you go into the press back real quick and type in jane

2671
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,080

01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,600
 you really want to be on wall street, you really want to be a player,

2712
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,520
 you know, you're not going to do it on robin hood.

2713
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,679
 it's just not not going to happen.

2714
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,360
 you know, you can't even short on robin hood.

2715
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,840
 so, yeah.

2716
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,920
 trying to make a real system that really works.

2717
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,600
 i'm feel bad for this guy, jason brown.

2718
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,480
 sorry, dude.

2719
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,120
 but, uh, you know, the point is, uh,

2720
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,080
 you know, it just doesn't make a lot of sense to

2721
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:42,320
 to if you're an individual investor to play with one hand tied behind your back.

2722
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,679
 i always say like, would you fight brock lesnar tonight in the cage?

2723
01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:46,639
 people, are you crazy?

2724
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:48,000
 i get my ass kicked.

2725
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,600
 and it's like, well, why are you trading against citadel and jane street?

2726
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,679
 you know, we got to fight these guys.

2727
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:56,880
 if you're gonna compete and the markets are competition, fight them head-to-head.

2728
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,560
 you know, fight fire with fire.

2729
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:01,120
 and i think that's something that's really hard to do if your tools suck.

2730
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,159
 and again, great firms.

2731
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:04,800
 jane street, some my best friends work there.

2732
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,360
 but, you know, they're they're killing us.

2733
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,400
 you know, they're making tons of money.

2734
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:09,679
 anyway, i appreciate the plug.

2735
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:11,120
 so, so real quick, 80 bucks a month.

2736
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:11,440
 that's it.

2737
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,560
 that's for people if they want to use it.

2738
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,360
 yeah, it's 80 a month.

2739
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,000
 i mean, listen, we're we're going after people who have tons of money.

2740
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,560
 it's it's free.

2741
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,639
 you know, you're not going to get everything for free.

2742
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,159
 i think one day we'll we'll have something that's like

2743
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:26,560
 like aws where you pay for what you use.

2744
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:28,000
 we want everyone to get

2745
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,120
 access to everything,

2746
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,719
 but it cost me millions of dollars to get data on bonds and things like that.

2747
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:33,760
 it's not

2748
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,400
 it's not cheap, but i i'm planning to

2749
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,239
 give you as much as i can for free.

2750
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,520
 again, just don't like bloomberg.

2751
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,639
 i'm happy to have a billion dollar company and take them down.

2752
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,920
 i don't need the 200300 billion dollar company mike has.

2753
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,320
 but i also know that wall street is

2754
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:48,560
 a

2755
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:49,520
 place with a lot of money and

2756
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:49,760
 they're

2757
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,400
 willing to pay tons

2758
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,280
 of money for software.

2759
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,920
 so i i still want to make individuals happy, but it's, you know,

2760
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,960
 it's hard to balance that.

2761
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:00,719
 yeah, martin, i appreciate it, man.

2762
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:01,360
 means a lot.

2763
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,320
 thank you for three hours.

2764
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:02,960
 appreciate it, brother.

2765
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:03,360
 thank you.

2766
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:04,239
 have a great day.

2767
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:04,639
 have a great one.
