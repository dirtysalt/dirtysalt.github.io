1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,490
- He said very specifically,

2
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:04,425
"Depending on the questions you ask Putin,

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,189
you could be arrested or not."

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,050
And I said, "Listen to what you're saying.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,340
You're saying the US government

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,200
has like control over my questions

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,450
and they'll arrest me if I ask the wrong question.

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,430
Like, how are we better than Putin if that's true?"

9
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,420
Killing Navalny during the Munich Security Conference

10
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,470
in the middle of a debate

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,589
over $60 billion in Ukraine funding,

12
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:28,200
maybe the Russians are dumb.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,030
I didn't get that vibe at all.

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,830
I don't think we kill people in other countries

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,450
to affect election outcomes.

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,623
Oh wait, no, we do it a lot, and have for 80 years.

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,160
- The following is a conversation

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,010
with Tucker Carlson, a highly influential

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,620
and often controversial political commentator.

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,110
When he was at, Fox, Time Magazine called him

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,420
the most powerful conservative in America.

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,210
After Fox, he has continued to host big,

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,150
impactful interviews and shows on X,

24
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,410
on the, "Tucker Carlson Podcast" and on, tuckercarlson.com.

25
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,860
I recommend subscribing, even if you disagree

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,410
with his views, it is always good

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,810
to explore a diversity of perspectives.

28
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,940
Most recently, he interviewed the President

29
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,770
of Russia, Vladimir Putin.

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,740
We discussed this, the topic of Russia, Putin, Navalny,

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,490
and the war in Ukraine at length in this conversation.

32
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,340
Please allow me to say a few words about the very fact

33
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,110
that I did this interview.

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,990
I have received a lot of criticism publicly

35
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,790
and privately when I announced

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,070
that I'll be talking with Tucker.

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,530
For people who think I shouldn't do the conversation

38
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,830
with Tucker or generally think that there are certain people

39
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,210
I should never talk to.

40
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,610
I'm sorry, but I disagree.

41
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,790
I will talk to everyone as long as they're willing

42
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,680
to talk genuinely in long form.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,320
for two, three, four or more hours.

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,510
I will talk to Putin and to Zelensky,

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,231
to Trump, and to Biden, to Tucker

46
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:57,990
and to Jon Stewart, AOC, Obama,

47
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,380
and many more people with very different views on the world.

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,950
I want to understand people and ideas.

49
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,450
That's what long form conversations

50
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,639
are supposed to be all about.

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,710
Now for people who criticize me

52
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,650
for not asking tough questions, I hear you,

53
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,570
but again, I disagree.

54
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,140
I do often ask tough questions, but I try to do it in a way

55
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,180
that doesn't shut down the other person,

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,550
putting them into a defensive state

57
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,190
where they give only shallow talking points.

58
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,800
Instead, I'm looking always for the expression

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,270
of genuinely held ideas and the deep roots of those ideas.

60
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,070
When done well, this gives us a chance

61
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,930
to really hear out the guest

62
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,320
and to begin to understand what and how they think.

63
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,080
And I trust the intelligence of you, the listener,

64
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,560
to make up your own mind, to see through the bullshit,

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,360
to the degree there's bullshit

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,120
and to see to the heart of the person.

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,950
Sometimes I fail at this,

68
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,550
but I'll continue working my ass off to improve.

69
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,140
All that said, I find that this no tough questions criticism

70
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,880
often happens when the guest is a person

71
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,210
the listener simply hates and wants to see them grilled

72
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,320
into embarrassment, called a liar, a greedy egomaniac,

73
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,320
a killer, maybe even an evil human being and so on.

74
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,400
If you are such a listener,

75
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,060
what you want is drama, not wisdom.

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,730
In this case, this show is not for you.

77
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,040
There are many shows you can go to for that

78
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,260
with hosts that are way more charismatic

79
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,543
and entertaining than I'll ever be.

80
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,460
If you do stick around, please know I will work hard

81
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,640
to do this well and to keep improving.

82
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,910
Thank you for your patience and thank you for your support.

83
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,813
I love you all.

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,990

And now, dear friends, here's Tucker Carlson.

88
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,690
What was your first impression

89
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,080
when you met Vladimir Putin for the interview?

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,530
- I thought he seemed nervous

91
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,410
and I was very surprised by that.

92
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,140
And I thought he seemed like someone

93
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,900
who'd overthought it a little bit, who had a plan.

94
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,890
And I don't think that's the right way

95
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,390
to go into any interview.

96
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,760
My strong sense, having done a lot of them for a long time,

97
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,970
is that it's better to know what you think,

98
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,779
to say as much as you can honestly,

99
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,600
so you don't get confused by your own lies

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,490
and just to be yourself.

101
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,720
And I thought that he went into it

102
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,940
like an over-prepared student.

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,210
And I kept thinking, "Why is he nervous?"

104
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,370
But I guess because he thought

105
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,660
a lot of people were gonna see it.

106
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,910
- But he was also probably prepared

107
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,910
to give you a full lesson in history as he did.

108
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,507
- (chuckles) Well, I was totally shocked by that

109
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:52,590
and very annoyed because I thought he was filibustering.

110
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,620
I thought he would, I mean, I asked him as I usually do,

111
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,260
the most obvious dumbest question ever,

112
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,003
which is, why'd you do this?

113
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:05,010
And he had said in a speech that I think is worth reading.

114
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,663
I don't speak Russian,

115
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:07,496
so I haven't heard it in the original,

116
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:12,496
but he had said at the moment of the beginning of the war,

117
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,810
he had given this address to Russians,

118
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,840
in which he explained to the fullest extent

119
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,810
we have seen so far why he was doing this.

120
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,160
And he said in that speech, I fear that NATO, the West,

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,720
the United States, the Biden administration

122
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,690
will preemptively attack us.

123
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,475
And I thought, "Well, that's interesting."

124
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,650
I mean, I can't evaluate whether that's a fear

125
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,990
rooted in reality or one rooted in paranoia.

126
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,900
But I thought, "Well, that's an answer right there."

127
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,880
And so I alluded to that in my question

128
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,030
and rather than answering it, he went off on this long,

129
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,163
from my perspective, kind of tiresome,

130
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,900
sort of greatest hits of Russian history.

131
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,630
And the implication I thought was, "Well,

132
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,280
Ukraine is ours, or Eastern Ukraine is ours already."

133
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,760
And I thought he was doing that

134
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,900
to avoid answering the question.

135
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,550
So, the last thing you want

136
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,913
when you're interviewing someone is to get rolled.

137
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,043
And I didn't wanna be rolled.

138
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:11,310
So, a couple of times interrupted him, politely I thought,

139
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,880
but he wasn't having it.

140
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,280
And then I thought, "You know what?

141
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm not here to prove that I'm a great interviewer."

142
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,690
It's kind of not about me, I want to know who this guy is.

143
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,000
I think a Western audience, a global audience,

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,800
has a right to know more about the guy,

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,690
and so just let him talk.

146
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,280
'Cause it's not, you know, I don't feel

147
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,860
like my reputation's on the line.

148
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,470
People have already drawn conclusions about me,

149
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,060
I suppose to the extent they have.

150
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,640
I'm not interested really in those conclusions anyway,

151
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,990
so just let him talk.

152
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,700
And so I calmed down and just let him talk.

153
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,960
And in retrospect,

154
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,240
I thought that was really, really interesting.

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,290
Whether you agree with it or not,

156
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,370
or whether you think it's relevant

157
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,910
to the war in Ukraine or not, that was his answer,

158
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,950
and so it's inherently significant.

159
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,150
- Well, you said he was nervous.

160
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,983
Were you nervous?

161
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:57,780
Were you afraid that says Vladimir Putin?

162
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,140
- I wasn't afraid at all, and I wasn't nervous at all.

163
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,156
- Did you drink tea beforehand?

164
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,930
- (chuckles) No, I did my normal regimen

165
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:10,410
of nicotine pouches and coffee.

166
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,640
No, I'm not a tea drinker.

167
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,000
I try not to eat all the sweets they put in front of us,

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,493
which is that is my weakness is eating crap.

169
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,710
But you eat a lot of sugar,

170
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,020
as you know before an interview, and it does dull you,

171
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,910
so I successfully resisted that.

172
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,750
But no, I wasn't nervous.

173
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,890
I wasn't nervous the whole time I was there.

174
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,723
Why would I be?

175
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,410
I'm 54, my kids are grown, I believe in God.

176
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,673
I'm almost never nervous.

177
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,789
But no, I wasn't nervous, I was just interested.

178
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,622
I mean, I couldn't.

179
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,580
I'm interested in Soviet history, I studied it in college.

180
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,840
I've read about it my entire life.

181
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,670
My dad worked in the Cold War.

182
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,920
It was a constant topic of conversation.

183
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,600
And so to be in the Kremlin in a room

184
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,060
where Stalin made decisions, either wartime decisions

185
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,760
or decisions about murdering his own population,

186
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,582
I just couldn't get over it.

187
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:55,050
We were in Molotov's old office.

188
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,780
So for me that was, I was just blown away by that.

189
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,733
I thought I knew a lot about Russia.

190
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,933
It turns out I knew a lot about the Soviet period,

191
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:06,990
the 1937 purge trials, the famine in Ukraine.

192
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,670
Like I knew a fair amount about that,

193
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,130
but I really knew nothing about contemporary Russia,

194
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,130
less than I thought I did it turned out.

195
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,880
But yeah, I was just blown away by where we were.

196
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,280
And that's kind of one of the main drivers

197
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,253
at this stage in my life of, you know,

198
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,720
that that's why I do what I do

199
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,980
is 'cause I'm interested in stuff

200
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,500
and I wanna see as much as I can and try

201
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,090
and draw conclusions from it to the extent I can,

202
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,970
so I was very much caught up in that.

203
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,092
But no, I wasn't nervous.

204
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:35,789
I didn't think he was gonna like, kill me or something.

205
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,340
And I'm not particularly afraid of that anyway.

206
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,929
- Not afraid of dying?

207
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,760
- Not really, no.

208
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,760
I mean, again, it's an age and stage in life thing.

209
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,530
I mean, I have four children,

210
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,300
so there were times when they were little

211
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,440
where I was terrified of dying,

212
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,250
'cause if I died it would have huge consequences.

213
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,800
But no, I mean, at this point, I don't want to die,

214
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,809
I'm really enjoying my life.

215
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,537
But I've been with the same girl for 40 years

216
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:06,450
and I have four children who I'm extremely close to.

217
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,120
Well now five, a daughter-in-law.

218
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,710
And I love them all, I'm really close to them.

219
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,559
I tell 'em I love them every day.

220
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,140
I've had a really interesting life.

221
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,973
- What was the goal?

222
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,806
Just linger on that.

223
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,020
What was the goal for the interview?

224
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,130
Like, how were you thinking about it?

225
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,740
What would success be like in your head leading into it.

226
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,350
- To bring more information. - [Lex] Just information?

227
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,753
- To the public, yeah, that's it.

228
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:28,750
I mean, I have really strong feelings about

229
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,930
what's happening not just in Ukraine or Russia,

230
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,770
but around the world.

231
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,180
I think the world is resetting

232
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,760
to the grave disadvantage of the United States.

233
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't think most Americans are aware of that at all.

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,830
And so, that's my view.

235
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,172
And I've stated it many times because it's sincere,

236
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:52,172
but my goal was to have more information brought to the West

237
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,960
so people could make their own decisions

238
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,393
about whether this is a good idea.

239
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:01,830
I mean, I guess I reject the whole premise

240
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,020
of the war in Ukraine from the American perspective,

241
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,080
which is a tiny group of dumb people in Washington

242
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,100
has decided to do this

243
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,560
for reasons they won't really explain.

244
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,350
And you don't have a role in it at all

245
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,080
as an American citizen, as the person who's paying for it,

246
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,750
whose children might be drafted to fight it,

247
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,650
to shut up and obey.

248
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,080
I just reject that completely.

249
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,420
I think, I guess I'm a child of a different era.

250
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,480
I'm a child of participatory democracy to some extent,

251
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,243
where your opinion as a citizen is not irrelevant.

252
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,080
And I guess the level of lying about it

253
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,430
was starting to drive me crazy.

254
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,840
And I've said, and I will say again,

255
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,700
I'm not an expert on the regional,

256
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,490
really any region other than say Western Maine.

257
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,773
I just don't, you know, I'm not Russian.

258
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,140
But it was obvious to me that we were being lied to

259
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,369
in ways that were just, it was crazy the scale of lies.

260
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:56,700
And I'll just give you one example.

261
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,600
The idea that Ukraine would inevitably win this war.

262
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,710
Now victory was never, as it never is defined precisely,

263
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,603
nothing's ever defined precisely, which is always to tell

264
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:08,970
that there's deception at the heart of the claim.

265
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,360
But Ukraine's on the verge of winning, well, I don't know.

266
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,940
I mean, I'm hardly a tactician or a military expert.

267
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,700
For the fifth time, I'm not an expert on Russia or Ukraine.

268
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,140
I just look at Wikipedia.

269
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,660
Russia has a hundred million more people than Ukraine.

270
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,683
A hundred million.

271
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,450
It has much deeper industrial capacity,

272
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,340
war material capacity than all of NATO combined.

273
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,370
For example, Russia is turning out artillery shells,

274
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,473
which are significant in a ground war

275
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:40,450
at a ratio of seven to one

276
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,340
compared to all NATO countries combined.

277
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,963
That's all of Europe.

278
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,700
Russia is producing seven times the artillery shells

279
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,890
as all of Europe combined.

280
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,170
What, that's an amazing fact.

281
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,472
And it turns out to be a really significant fact.

282
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:58,770
In fact, the significant fact.

283
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,020
But if you ask your average person in this country,

284
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,510
even a fairly well informed person of good faith

285
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,340
who's just trying to understand what's going on,

286
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,930
who's gonna win this war?

287
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,950
Well, Ukraine's gonna win.

288
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,330
They're on the right side.

289
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,400
And they think that because our media,

290
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,440
who really just do serve the interest of the US government,

291
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,260
period, they are state media in that sense,

292
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,720
have told him that for over two years.

293
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,880
And I was in Hungary last summer

294
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,920
talking to the prime minister, Viktor Orban,

295
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,853
who's a, you know, whatever you think of,

296
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:26,790
he's a very smart guy, very smart guy.

297
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,790
Like smart on a scale that we're not used to in our leaders.

298
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,510
And I said to him off camera, so is Ukraine gonna win?

299
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,640
And he looked at me like I was deranged,

300
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,640
like, or I was congenitally, deficient, are they gonna win?

301
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,270
No, of course they can't win.

302
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,400
It's tiny compared to Russia.

303
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,350
Russia has a wartime economy.

304
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,630
Ukraine doesn't really have an economy.

305
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,950
No, look at the populations.

306
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,260
He was like, looked at me like I was stupid.

307
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,210
And I said to him, I think most Americans believe

308
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,300
that because NBC News and CNN and all the news channels,

309
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,120
all of them tell them that because it's framed exclusively

310
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,670
in moral terms and it's Churchill versus Hitler.

311
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,130
And of course Churchill's gonna prevail in the end.

312
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,310
And it's just so dishonest that even, it doesn't even matter

313
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,040
what I want to happen or what I think ought to happen.

314
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,350
That's a distortion of what is happening.

315
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,610
And if I have any job at all,

316
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,410
which I sort of don't actually at this point,

317
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,140
but if I do have a job, it's to just try to be honest.

318
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,400
And that's a lie.

319
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,350
- There is a more nuanced discussion

320
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,150
about what winning might look like.

321
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,170
- For sure.

322
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,910
- A nuanced discussion is not being had,

323
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,030
but it is possible for Ukraine to, quote, unquote, "win"

324
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,560
with the help of the United States.

325
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,300
- I guess that conversation needs

326
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,460
to begin by defining terms.

327
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,280
And the key term is win.

328
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
What does that mean?

329
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,290
- Peace, a ceasefire, who owns which land.

330
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,480
- Yes. - Coming to the table

331
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,570
with as you call the parent, the United States.

332
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,403
- Yes.

333
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:51,780
- Putting leverage on the negotiation

334
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,790
to make sure there's a fairness.

335
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,260
- Amen, well, of course, and I should just restate this,

336
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,400
I am not emotionally involved in this.

337
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,230
I'm American in every sense.

338
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,420
And my only interest is in America.

339
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,790
I'm not leaving ever.

340
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,940
And so I'm looking at this purely from our perspective,

341
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,320
what's good for us.

342
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,910
But I also as a human being, as a Christian,

343
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,560
I mean, I hate war.

344
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,139
And anybody who doesn't hate war

345
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,180
shouldn't have power, in my opinion.

346
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,133
So I agree with those, that definition vehemently.

347
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,125
A victory is like not killing an entire generation

348
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,580
of your population.

349
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,550
It's not being completely destroyed to be eaten up

350
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,350
by BlackRock or whatever comes next for them.

351
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,770
So yeah, we were close to that a year and a half ago.

352
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:44,190
And the Biden administration dispatched Boris Johnson,

353
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,880
the briefly prime minister of the UK to stop it

354
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,820
and to say to Zelensky, who I feel sorry for, by the way,

355
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,230
'cause he's caught between these forces

356
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,560
that are bigger than he is to say, no,

357
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,380
you cannot come to any terms with Russia.

358
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,750
And the result of that has not been a Ukrainian victory.

359
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,370
It's just been more dead Ukrainians

360
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,170
and a lot of profit for the West.

361
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,500
It's a moral crime in my opinion.

362
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,090
And I tried to ask Boris Johnson about it

363
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,790
because why wouldn't I, after he denounced me

364
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,620
as a tool of the Kremlin or something,

365
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,340
and he demanded a million dollars to talk to me.

366
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,180
- [Lex] Oh wow.

367
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,604
- And this just happened last week.

368
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:21,926
And by the way, in writing too,

369
00:15:21,926 --> 00:15:23,769
I'm not making this.

370
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:24,602
- Just for the record,

371
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:26,108
you demanded a million dollars from me

372
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,720
to talk to me today. - (chuckles) I did.

373
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,220
And you paid.

374
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,219
No, I'm of course kidding.

375
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:33,197
And I said to his guy, I said,

376
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,480
I just interviewed Putin who was widely recognized

377
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,330
as a bad guy, and he did it for free.

378
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,620
He didn't demand a million dollars,

379
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,730
he wasn't in this for profit.

380
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,140
Like, are you telling me that Boris Johnson

381
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,550
is sleazier than Vladimir Putin?

382
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,770
And of course that is the message.

383
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,830
And so, I guess these are really,

384
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,360
it's not just about Boris Johnson

385
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,530
being a sad rapacious fraud, which he is obviously,

386
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,206
but it's about like the future of the west

387
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:02,310
and the future of Ukraine, this country that purportedly

388
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,960
we care so much about all these people are dying

389
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,730
and like what is the end game?

390
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,830
It's also deranged that I didn't imagine and don't imagine

391
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,630
that I could like add anything very meaningful

392
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,570
to the conversation because I'm not a genius, okay?

393
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,873
But I felt like I could at the very least,

394
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,000
puncture some of the lies.

395
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,130
And that's an inherent good.

396
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,810
- Vladimir Putin, after the interview

397
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,700
said that he wasn't fully satisfied

398
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,794
because you weren't aggressive enough.

399
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:30,236
(Tucker laughing)

400
00:16:30,236 --> 00:16:31,920
You didn't ask sharp enough questions.

401
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,260
First of all, what do you think about him saying that?

402
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,710
- I don't even understand it.

403
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,200
I guess it does seem like the one Putin statement

404
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,330
that Western media ticket face value,

405
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,010
everything else Putin says is a lie

406
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,050
except his criticism of me, which is true.

407
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,480
But I mean, I have no idea what he meant by that.

408
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,100
I can only tell you what my goal was, as I've suggested,

409
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,960
was not to make it about me.

410
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,180
I watched, you know, he hasn't done any interviews

411
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,200
of any kind for years, but the last interview he did

412
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,430
with an English speaking reporter, Western media reporter,

413
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,410
was like many of the other interviews

414
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,210
he'd done with Western media reporters,

415
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,970
Mike Wallace's son did an interview with him

416
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,650
that was of the same variety.

417
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,150
And it was all about him.

418
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,282
I'm a good person, you're a bad person.

419
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,579
And I just feel like that's the most tiresome,

420
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,900
fruitless kind of interview.

421
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,069
It's not about me.

422
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,750
I don't think I'm an especially good person.

423
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,460
I've definitely never claimed to be,

424
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,720
but people can make their own judgements.

425
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,710
And again, the only judgements

426
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,690
that I care about are my wife and children and God.

427
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,530
So I'm just not interested in proving I'm a good person.

428
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,123
And I just wanna hear from him.

429
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,489
And I had a lot of...

430
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:40,123
I mean, you should see.

431
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:42,600
I almost never write questions down, but I did in this case

432
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,550
because I had months to, well I had three years

433
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,980
to think about it as I was trying to book the interview,

434
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,750
which I did myself.

435
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,630
But they were all, it was all about

436
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,060
internal Russian politics and Navalny.

437
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,080
And I had a lot of, I thought really good questions.

438
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,300
And then at the last second, and you make these decisions,

439
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,610
as you know since you interview people a lot,

440
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,140
often you make them on the fly.

441
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,690
And I thought, no, I want to talk about the things

442
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,830
that haven't been talked about

443
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,500
and that I think matter in a world historic sense.

444
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,470
And the number one among those, of course, is the war

445
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,600
and what it means for the world.

446
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,460
And so, I stuck to that.

447
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,480
I mean, I could have asked.

448
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,670
I did ask about Gershkovich,

449
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,940
who I felt sorry for, and I wanted Putin

450
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,200
to release him to me.

451
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,940
And I was offended that he didn't.

452
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,860
I thought his rationale was absurd.

453
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,090
Well, we wanna trade him for someone.

454
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,150
I said, well that doesn't that make him a hostage?

455
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,912
You know, which of course it does.

456
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:37,380
But other than that, I really wanted to keep it

457
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,425
to the things that I think matter most.

458
00:18:39,425 --> 00:18:41,730
People can judge whether I did a good job or not,

459
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,610
but that was my decision.

460
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,350
- In the moment, what was your gut,

461
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,110
did you wanna ask some tough questions

462
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,350
as follow ups on certain topics?

463
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,360
- I dunno what it would mean to ask a tough question.

464
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,501
- Clarifying questions, I suppose they would-

465
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,334
- I guess.

466
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:59,167
I just wanted him to talk.

467
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,020
I just wanted to hear his perspective.

468
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,433
Again, I've probably asked more asshole questions

469
00:19:05,433 --> 00:19:07,290
than like any living American.

470
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,123
- [Lex] Sure.

471
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:10,440
- I'm has been noted correctly,

472
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,333
I'm a dick by my nature.

473
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,290
And so I don't, I just feel at this stage of my life,

474
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,670
I didn't need to prove that I could,

475
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,290
like, "Vladimir Putin answer the question." (laughs)

476
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,300
- Sure, for sure.

477
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,230
- You know, I think if I had been, 34 instead of 54,

478
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,946
I definitely would've done that,

479
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,910
'cause I would've thought, this is really about me

480
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,510
and I need to prove myself and all stuff.

481
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,707
No, there's a war going on

482
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:35,970
that is wrecking the US economy in a way

483
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,740
and at scale people do not understand.

484
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,720
The US dollars going away.

485
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,700
That was of course, inevitable ultimately

486
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,800
because everything dies, including currencies.

487
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,400
But that death, that process of death

488
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,130
has been accelerated exponentially by the behavior

489
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,750
of the Biden administration and the US Congress,

490
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,391
particularly the sanctions.

491
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:54,393
And peoples don't understand

492
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,010
what the ramifications of that are.

493
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,860
Ramifications are poverty in the United States, okay?

494
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,730
So, I just wanted to get to that

495
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,550
because I'm coming at this from not a global perspective,

496
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,100
I'm coming at it from an American perspective.

497
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,500
- So, you mentioned Navalny.

498
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,700
After you left, Navalny died in prison.

499
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,533
- [Tucker] Yes.

500
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:17,250
- What are your thoughts on,

501
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,040
just at a high-level first about his death?

502
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,090
- Well, it's awful.

503
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,923
I mean, imagine dying in prison.

504
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,960
I've thought about it a lot.

505
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,850
I've known a lot of people in prison a lot,

506
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,130
including some very good friends of mine,

507
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,233
so I felt instantly sad about it.

508
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,500
From a geopolitical perspective,

509
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,100
I don't know any more than that.

510
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,900
And I laugh at and sort of resent,

511
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,560
but mostly find amusing the claims by American politicians

512
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,970
who really are the dumbest politicians

513
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,563
in the world actually.

514
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,440
This happened and here's what it means.

515
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,270
And it's like, actually as a factual matter,

516
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,710
we don't know what happened.

517
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,610
We don't know what happened.

518
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,650
We have no freaking idea what happened.

519
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,353
We can say, and I did say, and I will say again, I think,

520
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,440
I don't think you should put opposition figures in prison.

521
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,854
I really don't.

522
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:04,710
I don't, period.

523
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,000
It happens a lot around the world.

524
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,590
Happens in this country as you know,

525
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,570
and I'm against all of it.

526
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,850
But do we know how we died?

527
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,010
The short answer, no, we don't.

528
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:18,600
Now, if I had to guess, I would say killing Navalny

529
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,300
during the Munich Security Conference

530
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,350
in the middle of a debate

531
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,342
over $60 billion in Ukraine funding.

532
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:27,525
Maybe the Russians are dumb.

533
00:21:27,525 --> 00:21:29,553
I didn't get that vibe at all.

534
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,433
I don't see it.

535
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:32,910
But maybe they killed him.

536
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,240
I mean, they certainly put him in prison, which I'm against,

537
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,940
but here's what I do know is that we don't know.

538
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,616
And so when Chuck Schumer stands up and rah,

539
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:44,520
Joe Biden reads some card in front of him

540
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,020
with lines about Navalny, it's like,

541
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,210
I'm allowed to laugh at that because it's absurd.

542
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,043
You don't know.

543
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:51,123
- There's a lot of interesting ideas about

544
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:53,280
if he was killed, who killed him.

545
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,113
- [Tucker] Yeah.

546
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,490
- Because it could be Putin,

547
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,870
it could be somebody in Russia who's not Putin.

548
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,440
- Yeah. - It could be Ukrainians

549
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,730
'cause it would benefit the war.

550
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,040
- They killed Dugin's daughter in Moscow.

551
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,870
So yeah, it's possible.

552
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,270
- And it could be, I mean, the United States

553
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,680
could also be involved.

554
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,510
- I don't think we kill people in other countries

555
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,130
to affect election outcomes.

556
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,120
Oh wait, no, we do it a lot and have for 80 years.

557
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,990
And it's shameful.

558
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,666
I can say that as an American,

559
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,073
'cause it's my money in my name.

560
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,697
Yeah. I'm really offended by that.

561
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:26,852
And I never thought that was true.

562
00:22:26,852 --> 00:22:28,440
And I spent, again, I'm much older than you.

563
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,073
And so I spent my worldview was defined by the Cold War.

564
00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:35,222
And very much in the house I lived

565
00:22:35,222 --> 00:22:36,900
in Georgetown, Washington, DC,

566
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,950
that's what we talked about.

567
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:40,353
And yeah, and the left at the time,

568
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,610
I don't know the wacko MIT professor

569
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,702
who I never had any respect for,

570
00:22:46,702 --> 00:22:48,510
who I know you've interviewed, et cetera.

571
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,190
Like the hard left was always saying,

572
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,480
well, the United States government

573
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,310
is interfering in other elections.

574
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:57,690
And I just dismissed that completely out of hand as stupid

575
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,580
and actually a slander against my country.

576
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,930
But it turned out to all be true

577
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,503
or substantially true anyway.

578
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:04,336
And that's been a real shock for me

579
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:05,880
in middle age to understand that.

580
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,180
But anyway, as to Navalny, look, I don't know,

581
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,770
but we should always proceed on the basis

582
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,870
of what we do know, which is to say on the basis

583
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,970
of truth, knowable truth.

584
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,090
And if you have an entire policymaking apparatus

585
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,160
that is making the biggest decisions

586
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,410
on the face of the planet, on the basis of things

587
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,540
that are bullshit or lies,

588
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,900
you're gonna get bad outcomes every time.

589
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,733
Every time.

590
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,900
And that's why we are where we are.

591
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,190
- Does it bother you

592
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,070
that basically the most famous opposition figure

593
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,860
in Russia is sitting in prison?

594
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,330
- Well, of course it does.

595
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,560
Of course it bothers me.

596
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,880
I mean, it bothered me when I got there.

597
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,713
It bothers me now.

598
00:23:45,713 --> 00:23:47,280
I was sad when he died.

599
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,580
Yeah, I mean that's one of the measures of,

600
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,310
it's one of the basic measures of political freedom.

601
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,283
Are you imprisoning people who oppose you?

602
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,970
Are you imprisoning people who pose a physical risk to you?

603
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,080
I mean, there's some subjective decision making

604
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,280
involved in these things, however, big picture.

605
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,013
Yeah, do you have opposition leaders in jail?

606
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,307
It's not a politically free society,

607
00:24:14,307 --> 00:24:16,263
and Russia isn't, obviously.

608
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,440
And as I said, a friend of mine from childhood,

609
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,810
an American actually was a wonderful person

610
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,640
lives in Russia with his Russian, Moscow,

611
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,930
with his Russian wife.

612
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,250
And I had dinner with him.

613
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:29,443
He's a very balanced guy, totally non-political person

614
00:24:29,443 --> 00:24:33,930
and speaks Russian and loves his many Russian children,

615
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,980
and loves the culture.

616
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,120
And there's a lot to love.

617
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,688
The culture that produced Tolstoy.

618
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:39,780
It's not a gas station with nuclear weapons.

619
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,640
Sorry, only an a moron would say

620
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,410
that it's a very deep culture.

621
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,020
I don't fully understand it, of course, but I admire it.

622
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,340
Who wouldn't?

623
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,636
But I asked him like, what's it like living here?

624
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:50,469
And he goes, "It's great."

625
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:52,920
Moscow is a great city indisputably.

626
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,895
He said, "You don't wanna get involved in Russian politics."

627
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,180
And I said, "What?"

628
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,380
He said, "Well, you could get hurt,

629
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,140
you could wind up like Navalny if you did."

630
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,210
But also, it's just too complicated.

631
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,180
The Russian mind is not exactly the same.

632
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,340
It's a Western, it's a European city,

633
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,810
but it's not quite European.

634
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:14,190
And the way they think is very, very complex. Very complex.

635
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,500
It's just, it's too complicated, just don't get involved.

636
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,350
And I would just say two things.

637
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,350
One, I'm not sure, I mean like, I don't know,

638
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,830
but my strong sense is that Navalny death, whoever did it,

639
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,760
probably didn't have a lot to do

640
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,910
with the coming election in Russia.

641
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,100
My sense from talking to Putin and the people around him

642
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,333
is they're not really focused on that.

643
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,060
I mean, in fact, I asked one of his top advisors,

644
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,930
when's the election?

645
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,100
And she looked at me completely confused.

646
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,302
She didn't know the date of the election, okay? (chuckles)

647
00:25:44,302 --> 00:25:46,890
She's like, March. Okay.

648
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,784
And I asked a bunch of other people just in Moscow,

649
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:52,800
who's Putin running against, like nobody knew.

650
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,500
So it's not a real election, right?

651
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,083
In the sense that we would recognize at all.

652
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:02,880
Second, I was really struck by so many things in Moscow

653
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,010
and really bothered by, deeply bothered

654
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,391
by a lot of things that I saw there.

655
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:12,391
But one thing I noticed was the total absence of cult

656
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,330
of personality propaganda, which I expected to see

657
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,410
and have seen around the world.

658
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,870
Jordan, for example, I dunno if you've been to Jordan,

659
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,550
but go to Jordan in every building

660
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,980
there are pictures of the king and his extended family.

661
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,987
And that's a sign of political insecurity.

662
00:26:24,987 --> 00:26:26,845
You don't create a cult of personality

663
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:28,710
unless you're personally insecure.

664
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,300
And also unless you're worried about

665
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:33,180
losing your grip on power, none of that.

666
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,490
It's interesting and I expected to see a lot of it,

667
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,290
like statues of Putin.

668
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,000
Yeah, there are no statues of anybody

669
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,580
other than like Christian saints.

670
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,990
So that was like, I'm not quite sure.

671
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,490
I'm just reporting what I saw.

672
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,340
So yes, in a political sense, it's not a free country.

673
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,250
It's not a democracy in the way

674
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,504
that we would understand it or want.

675
00:26:55,504 --> 00:26:56,337
I don't wanna live there, okay?

676
00:26:56,337 --> 00:26:57,480
'Cause I like to say what I think.

677
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,180
In fact I make my living doing it.

678
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:04,890
But it's not Stalinist in a recognizable way.

679
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,160
And anyone who says it is should go there and tell me how.

680
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,700
- I mean this question about the freedom of the press

681
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,280
is underlying the very fact

682
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,440
of the interview you're having with him.

683
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,230
So you might not need to ask the Navalny question,

684
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,773
but did you feel like, are there things I shouldn't say?

685
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,650
- I mean, how honest do you want me to be?

686
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,360
I mean it, when I say I felt not one twinge of concern

687
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,730
for the eight days that I was there.

688
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,563
Maybe I just didn't.

689
00:27:33,563 --> 00:27:36,352
And I feel like I've got a pretty strong

690
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:37,830
gut sense of things.

691
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,663
I rely on it.

692
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:42,540
I make all my decisions based on how I feel, my instincts.

693
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,013
And I didn't feel it at all.

694
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,770
My lawyers before I left.

695
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:49,294
And these are people who work for a big law firm.

696
00:27:49,294 --> 00:27:50,130
This is not Bob's law firm, this is one

697
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,787
of the biggest law firms in the world, said,

698
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:53,580
"You're gonna get arrested if you do this

699
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,097
by the US government on sanctioned violations."

700
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,670
And I said, well, I don't recognize

701
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,960
the legitimacy of that actually,

702
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,450
'cause I'm American and I've lived here my whole life.

703
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,740
And that's so outrageous that I'm happy to face that risk

704
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,860
because I so reject the premise, okay?

705
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,754
I'm an American, I should be able

706
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:13,910
to talk to anyone I want to."

707
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,743
And I plan to exercise that freedom,

708
00:28:14,743 --> 00:28:16,781
which I think I was born with.

709
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:18,510
And I gave them this long lecture.

710
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,190
They're like, "We're just lawyers."

711
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,630
But that was, it was a, lemme put it this way,

712
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,890
I dunno how much you've dealt with lawyers,

713
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,140
but it costs many thousands of dollars

714
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,820
to get a conclusion like that.

715
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,700
Like they sent a whole bunch of their summer associates

716
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,410
or whatever they sent, they put a lot of people

717
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,440
on this question, checked a lot of precedent and I think,

718
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,970
and they sent me a 10 page memo on it

719
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,723
and their sincere conclusion was do not do this.

720
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,820
And of course it made me mad.

721
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,200
So I was lecturing on the phone

722
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,007
and I had another call with a head lawyer and he said,

723
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,910
"Well look, a lot will depend on the questions

724
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,590
that you ask Putin.

725
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,750
If you're seen as too nice to him,

726
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,501
you could get arrested when you come back."

727
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:00,090
And I was like, "You're describing a fascist country, okay?

728
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:02,250
You're saying that the US government will arrest me

729
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,960
if I don't ask the questions they want asked

730
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,107
is that's what you're saying?"

731
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:06,690
"Well, we just think based on what's happened,

732
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,977
that that's possible."

733
00:29:07,977 --> 00:29:11,640
And so I'm just telling you what happened.

734
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,581
- So, you were okay being arrested in Moscow.

735
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:15,881
and arrested back in-

736
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:16,967
- I didn't think for a second.

737
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:20,010
I mean maybe, look, I don't speak Russian,

738
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,009
I'd never been there before.

739
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:25,113
Everything about the culture was brand new to me.

740
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:29,700
Ignorance does protect you sort of,

741
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,510
when you have no freaking idea what's going on,

742
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,343
you're not worried about it.

743
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,070
Like this has happened to me many times.

744
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,410
There's a principle there that extends throughout life.

745
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,870
So it's completely possible that I was in grave peril

746
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,990
and didn't know it, 'cause like how would I know it?

747
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,987
I'm like a bumbling English speaker from California,

748
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:48,660
but I didn't feel it at all.

749
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,950
- But the lawyers did.

750
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:53,452
- Yeah, I mean it scared the crap out of people.

751
00:29:53,452 --> 00:29:55,770
And look, and you have to pay in cash.

752
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,480
They don't take credit cards because of sanctions.

753
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,830
And you have to go through all these hoops,

754
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,860
just procedural hoops to go to Russia.

755
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,693
Which I was willing to do

756
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:04,500
because I wanted to interview Putin

757
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,610
because they told me I couldn't.

758
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,800
But then there's another fact,

759
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,290
which is that I was being surveilled by the US government,

760
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,600
intensely surveilled by the US government.

761
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,827
And this came out, they admitted it,

762
00:30:13,827 --> 00:30:15,870
the NSA admitted it a couple of years ago

763
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,790
that they were up in my Signal account,

764
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,050
and then they leaked it to, The New York Times.

765
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,690
They did that again before I left.

766
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,850
And I know that because two New York Times reporters,

767
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,393
one of whom I actually like a lot, said,

768
00:30:28,897 --> 00:30:30,600
"Oh, you're going and called other people,

769
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,440
Oh, he's going to interview Putin."

770
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,570
I hadn't told anybody that, like anybody.

771
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,450
My wife, two producers, that's it.

772
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,830
So, they got that from the government.

773
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,770
Then I'm over there and of course I wanna see Snowden,

774
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:41,733
who I admire.

775
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,820
And so, we have a mutual friend,

776
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,980
so I got his text and come on over

777
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,533
and Snowden does not want publicity at all.

778
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,710
And so, but I really wanted to have dinner with him.

779
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,921
So we had dinner in my hotel room

780
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,420
at the Four Seasons in Moscow.

781
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,058
And I tried to convince him,

782
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,608
I'd love to do an interview, shoot it on my iPhone,

783
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,400
I'd love to take a picture together

784
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,233
and put it on the internet

785
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,070
because I just wanna show support.

786
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,540
'Cause I think he's been railroaded.

787
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,330
He had no interest in living in Russia,

788
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,070
no intention of being in Russia.

789
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,903
The whole thing is a lie.

790
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:16,500
But anyway, whatever, all this stuff.

791
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,000
And he just said respectfully,

792
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,070
I'd rather not anyone know that we met.

793
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,030
Great.

794
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,120
The only reason I'm telling you this is because,

795
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,570
and I didn't tell anybody and I didn't text it to anybody.

796
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,807
Okay, except him.

797
00:31:30,511 --> 00:31:32,753
Semafor, Semafor runs this piece

798
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:39,810
saying reporting information

799
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,760
they got from the US Intel agencies

800
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,490
leaking against me using my money in my name

801
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,680
in a supposedly free country.

802
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,110
They run this piece saying I'd met with Snowden

803
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,880
like it was a crime or something.

804
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,910
So again, my interest is in the United States

805
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,236
and preserving freedoms here, the ones that I grew up with.

806
00:31:57,236 --> 00:31:58,680
And if you have a media establishment

807
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,260
that acts as an auxiliary of,

808
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,290
or acts as employees of the national security state,

809
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,820
you don't have a free country.

810
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,170
And that's where we are.

811
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,765
And I'm not guessing,

812
00:32:08,765 --> 00:32:10,020
'cause I spent my entire life in that world.

813
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,050
33 years I worked in big news companies,

814
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,040
and so I know how it works,

815
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,810
I know the people involved in it.

816
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,190
I could name them.

817
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,800
Ben Smith of Semafor among many others.

818
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,698
And I find that really objectionable,

819
00:32:21,698 --> 00:32:25,773
not just on principle either, in effect, in practice,

820
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:26,820
I don't wanna live in that kind of country.

821
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,770
And people are like, they externalize

822
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,350
all of their anxiety about this, I have noticed.

823
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,720
So, it's like Russia's not free.

824
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,553
Yeah, I know.

825
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,500
Neither's Burkina Faso.

826
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,879
Like most countries aren't free actually, but we are.

827
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:42,480
We're the United States, we're different.

828
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,710
And that's my concern.

829
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,810
Preserving that is my concern.

830
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,080
And so they get so exercised about what's happening

831
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,220
in other parts of the world,

832
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,770
places they've never been know nothing about.

833
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,630
It's almost a way of ignoring what's happening

834
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,250
in their own country right around them.

835
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,300
I find it so strange and sad and weird.

836
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,590
- So the NSA was tracking you, as do you think CIA was?

837
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,390
Is people still tracking you?

838
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:09,510
- Look, one of the things I did before I went,

839
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,100
just because of the business I'm in,

840
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,170
all of us are in and just 'cause we live here,

841
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,340
we all have theories about secure communications channels.

842
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,850
Like Signal is secure, Telegraph isn't,

843
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,920
or WhatsApp is owned by Mark Zuckerberg.

844
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,562
You can't trust, okay?

845
00:33:24,562 --> 00:33:25,663
So I thought, before I go over here,

846
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:26,883
I was getting all this,

847
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,100
we're having all these conversations,

848
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,020
my producers and I about this,

849
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,170
and I decide, I'm just gonna actually find out

850
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,120
like what's really going on.

851
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,560
So, I talked to two people who would know,

852
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,737
trust me, and it's all I can say.

853
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:45,420
And I hate to be like, "Oh, I talked to people

854
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,193
who would know by kentu there,"

855
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,883
but I mean it, they would know.

856
00:33:49,883 --> 00:33:50,730
And both of them said exactly the same thing,

857
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,710
which is, are you joking?

858
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,060
Nothing is secure.

859
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,800
Everything is monitored all the time.

860
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,510
If state actors are involved,.

861
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,370
I mean you can keep the, you know,

862
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,080
whatever, the Malaysian mafia

863
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,380
from reading your texts probably you cannot keep

864
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,000
the big intel services from reading your texts.

865
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,380
It's not possible.

866
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,213
Any of them.

867
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,513
Or listening to your calls.

868
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,170
And that was the firm conclusion of people

869
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:15,719
who've been involved in it for a long time.

870
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,980
Decades, in both cases.

871
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,630
So I just thought, "You know what?

872
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,940
I don't care, I don't care.

873
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,100
I'm not sending a ton of naked pictures

874
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,630
of myself to anybody."

875
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,016
- Not a ton, just a little. - (laughs) A ton.

876
00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:29,657
I'm 54, dude, probably not too many.

877
00:34:29,657 --> 00:34:30,719
- [Lex] All right.

878
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,850
- But you, so I'm like, I'm just,

879
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:35,370
so the guys I travel with,

880
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,170
three people I work with who I love,

881
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,330
who I've been around the world with for many years,

882
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,784
and I know them really, really well.

883
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:44,070
And they all got separate phones

884
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,226
and I'm leaving my other phone back in New York or whatever.

885
00:34:46,226 --> 00:34:50,400
And I just decided I don't care actually.

886
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,400
And I resent having to no privacy

887
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,770
because privacy is a prerequisite for freedom,

888
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,730
but I can't change it,

889
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,010
and so I have the same surveilled cell phone.

890
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:06,570
And I do switch them out because there it is.

891
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,010
Because if you have too much spyware on your phone,

892
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,270
this is true.

893
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:16,050
It wrecks the battery. (Lex chuckling)

894
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,310
No, I'm serious.

895
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,143
It does.

896
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:19,650
And we got, it was, I don't know,

897
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,320
five or six years ago we went to North Korea

898
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,800
and my phone started acting crazy.

899
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,710
And so I talked to someone on the National Security Council

900
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,330
who called me about this,

901
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:33,090
somehow knew that your phone is being surveilled

902
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,243
by the South Korean government.

903
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:36,420
I was like, why the, I like the South Korean government.

904
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,160
Why would they do that?

905
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,210
Because they want more information.

906
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,790
They thought I was talking to Trump or whatever.

907
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,370
So, but I could tell because all of a sudden

908
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,950
the thing would just drain in like 45 minutes.

909
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,743
So, that's the downside.

910
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,680
- So you keep switching phones,

911
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,210
getting new phones for the battery life.

912
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,043
That's good.

913
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:55,876
- Yeah. I mean, I try not to do it,

914
00:35:55,876 --> 00:35:59,430
I'm kind of flinty Yankee type in some ways,

915
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,740
so I don't like to spend a thousand dollars

916
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,493
with a freaking Apple corporation too often,

917
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:05,515
but yeah, I do.

918
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:06,670
- I mean, you say it lightly,

919
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,811
but it's really troublesome

920
00:36:07,811 --> 00:36:10,020
that you as a journalist would be tracked.

921
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,670
- Well, they leaked it to Semafor,

922
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,020
and they leaked it to The New York Times.

923
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,291
Look, I would even put up, well there's nothing I can do,

924
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,840
so I have to put up with everything, okay?

925
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,620
But I would probably not be actively angry

926
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,050
about being surveilled because I'm just so old

927
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,816
and I actually do pay my taxes.

928
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:29,670
I'm not sleeping with the makeup artist or whatever,

929
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,290
so I don't care that much.

930
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,170
The fact that they are leaking against me,

931
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,540
that the intel services in the United States

932
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,473
are actively engaged in US politics and media.

933
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,960
That's so unacceptable.

934
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,000
That makes democracy impossible.

935
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,757
There's no defense of that.

936
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:50,400
And yet NBC News, Ken Dilanian and the rest will defend it.

937
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,370
And it's like, and not just on NBC news, by the way,

938
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,350
on the supposedly conservative channels too.

939
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,017
They will defend it.

940
00:36:57,017 --> 00:36:59,568
And there's no defending that you can't have democracy

941
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:03,570
if the intel services are tampering in elections

942
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,522
and information, period.

943
00:37:05,522 --> 00:37:07,428
- So, you had no fear.

944
00:37:07,428 --> 00:37:11,250
Your lawyer said, be careful which questions he asked

945
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,050
you said, I don't have-

946
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,700
- Well, the lawyer said no, he said very specifically

947
00:37:16,747 --> 00:37:19,593
"Depending on the questions you ask Putin,

948
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:23,520
you could be arrested or not."

949
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,350
And I said, "Listen to what you're saying.

950
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,750
You're saying the US government has like control

951
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,130
over my questions and they'll arrest me

952
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,750
if I ask the wrong question.

953
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,700
Like, how are we better than Putin if that's true?"

954
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,110
And by the way, that's just what the lawyer said,

955
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,490
but I can't overstate one of the biggest law firms

956
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,167
in the United States, smart lawyers we've used for years.

957
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:42,690
So, I was really shocked by it.

958
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,920
- You said leaders kill, leaders lie.

959
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,980
- Yeah, I don't believe in leaders very much

960
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,000
like this whole like Zelensky's Jesus and Putin's Satan.

961
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,730
It's like, no, they're all leaders of countries, okay?

962
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,606
Like grow up a little bit, you child.

963
00:37:56,606 --> 00:37:57,990
Have you ever met a leader?

964
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,240
Like all of the, first of all, anyone who seeks power

965
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,560
is damaged morally, in my opinion.

966
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,850
You shouldn't be seeking power.

967
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:10,140
You can't seek power or wealth for its own sake

968
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,490
and remain a decent person.

969
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,870
That's just true.

970
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,840
So there aren't any like really virtuous billionaires

971
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,090
and there aren't any really virtuous world leaders.

972
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,850
You have grades of virtue.

973
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,370
Some are better than others for sure.

974
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,290
But I mean, in other words,

975
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,480
Zelensky may be better than Putin.

976
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,610
I'm open to that possibility.

977
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,933
But to claim that one is evil and the other is virtuous,

978
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,170
it's like you're revealing that you're a child.

979
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,430
You don't know anything about

980
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:41,883
how the world actually is or what reality is.

981
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,910
- That's quite a realist perspective.

982
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,260
But there is a spectrum.

983
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,550
- There is a spectrum, absolutely.

984
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,960
I'm not saying they're all the same, they're not.

985
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,520
- And our task is to figure out

986
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,590
where on the spectrum they lie,

987
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,390
and the leader's task is to confuse us

988
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,160
and convince us they're one of the good guys.

989
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,993
- Of course, of course.

990
00:38:59,993 --> 00:39:02,190
But I actually reject even that formulation.

991
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,457
I don't think it's always about the leaders.

992
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:06,960
I mean, of course the leaders make the difference.

993
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,787
A good leader has a healthy country

994
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:11,130
and a bad leader has a decaying country,

995
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:12,830
which is something to think about.

996
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,780
But it's about the ideas and the policies

997
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,550
and the practical effect of things.

998
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,490
So we're very much caught up in the personalities

999
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,910
of various leaders, not just our political leaders,

1000
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,220
but our business leaders, our cultural leaders.

1001
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,869
Are they good people?

1002
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:28,702
Do they have the right thoughts?

1003
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,230
It's like, no, I ask a much more basic question.

1004
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,540
What are the fruits of their behavior?

1005
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,740
And I always make it personal

1006
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,780
because I think everything is personal.

1007
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,790
Does his wife respect him?

1008
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,810
Do his children respect him?

1009
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,890
How are they doing?

1010
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:45,030
Is the country he runs thriving or is it falling apart?

1011
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,980
If your life expectancy is going down,

1012
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,390
if your suicide rate is going up,

1013
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,100
if your standard of living is tanking,

1014
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,180
you're not a good leader.

1015
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,530
I don't care what you tell me.

1016
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,990
I don't care what you claim you represent.

1017
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,849
I don't care about the ideas

1018
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:00,120
or the systems that you say you embody.

1019
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,040
It's dogs barking to me.

1020
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,080
How's your life expectancy?

1021
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,640
How's your suicide rate?

1022
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,990
What's drug use like?

1023
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,090
Are people having children?

1024
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,360
Are people's children more likely to live in a free

1025
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,127
or more prosperous society than than you did

1026
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:15,210
and their grandparents did?

1027
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:17,130
Like those are the only measures that matter to me.

1028
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,780
The rest is a lie.

1029
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,689
But anyway, the point is we just get so obsessed

1030
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:26,689
with like the theater around people or people

1031
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,300
and we miss the bigger things that are happening

1032
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,300
and we allow ourselves to be deceived into thinking that

1033
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,860
what doesn't matter at all matters.

1034
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,630
That moral victories are all that matters.

1035
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,790
No actually facts in the ground victories

1036
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,690
matter more than anything.

1037
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,710
I mean you certainly see it in this country.

1038
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,570
Black Lives Matter for example.

1039
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,493
How many black people did that help?

1040
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,740
It hurt a lot of black people,

1041
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,316
but in the end we should be able to measure it.

1042
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:55,860
Like how many black people have died by gunfire

1043
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,630
in the four years since George Floyd died?

1044
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,460
Well the number's gone way, way up.

1045
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,500
And that was a Black Lives Matter operation,

1046
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,730
defund the police.

1047
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,190
So I think we can say as a factual matter,

1048
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,790
data-based matter, Black Lives Matter

1049
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,227
didn't help black people.

1050
00:41:10,227 --> 00:41:11,893
And if it did tell me how.

1051
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:14,640
Well, these are important moral victories, I'm over that.

1052
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,210
That's just another lie, long litany of lies.

1053
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,370
So I try to see the rest of the world that way,

1054
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,640
but more than anything I try to see world events

1055
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,550
through the lens of an American because I am one.

1056
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,990
And what does this mean for us?

1057
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,370
And it's not even the war,

1058
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:34,260
it's the sanctions that will forever change

1059
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,540
the United States, our standard of living,

1060
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,100
the way our government operates.

1061
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,834
That more than any single thing in my lifetime

1062
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,753
screwed the United States.

1063
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,073
Levying those sanctions in the way that we did was crazy.

1064
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,490
For me the main takeaway from my eight days

1065
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:51,960
in Moscow was not Putin.

1066
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,364
He's a leader with, whatever.

1067
00:41:54,364 --> 00:41:56,330
None of them are that different actually

1068
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,560
in my pretty extensive experience.

1069
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,460
No, it was Moscow that blew my mind.

1070
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,380
I was not prepared for that at all.

1071
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,760
And I thought I knew a lot about Moscow.

1072
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,210
My dad worked there on and off in the 80s and 90s

1073
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:09,360
'cause US government employee

1074
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,193
and he was always coming back,

1075
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:11,430
"Moscow, it's a nightmare."

1076
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,180
And all this stuff, no electricity.

1077
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,470
I got there almost exactly two years

1078
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,480
after sanctions totally cut off

1079
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,180
from Western financial systems, kicked outta Swift,

1080
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,183
can't use US dollars, no banking, no credit cards.

1081
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:27,960
And that city is just factually,

1082
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,580
I'm not endorsing the system.

1083
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,960
I'm not endorsing the whole country.

1084
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,380
I didn't go to Lake Baikal, I didn't go to Turkmenistan.

1085
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,430
I just went to Moscow,

1086
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,680
largest city in Europe, 13 million people.

1087
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,030
I drove all around it.

1088
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,613
And that city is way nicer outwardly anyway,

1089
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:46,710
I don't live there, than any city we have by a lot.

1090
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:48,930
And by nicer, let me be specific.

1091
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,880
No graffiti, no homeless,

1092
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,730
no people using drugs in the street, totally tidy,

1093
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:58,730
no garbage on the ground and no forest of steel

1094
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,470
and concrete soul destroying buildings.

1095
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,970
None of the postmodern architecture

1096
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:06,480
that oppresses us without even our knowledge.

1097
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,160
None of that crap.

1098
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,410
It's a truly beautiful city.

1099
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,021
And that's not an endorsement of Putin.

1100
00:43:13,021 --> 00:43:15,330
And by the way, it didn't make me love Putin.

1101
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,220
It made me hate my own leaders

1102
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,390
because I grew up in a country

1103
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,803
that had cities kind of like that,

1104
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:22,110
that were nice cities that were safe.

1105
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,910
And we don't have that anymore.

1106
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,743
And how did that happen?

1107
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:25,576
Did Putin do that?

1108
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:27,120
I don't think Putin did that actually.

1109
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,160
I think the people in charge of it, the mayors,

1110
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,110
the governors, the president, they did that

1111
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,000
and they should be held accountable for it.

1112
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,540
- So, I think cleanliness and architectural design

1113
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,240
is not the entirety of the metrics

1114
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,070
that matter When you measure a city.

1115
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,840
- They're the main metrics that matter.

1116
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,070
They're the main metrics that matter.

1117
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,760
The main metrics that matter are cleanliness,

1118
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,220
safety, and beauty in my opinion.

1119
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,720
And one of the big lies that we are told in our world

1120
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,720
is that no, something you can't measure

1121
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,933
that has no actual effect on your life matters most.

1122
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:05,910
Bullshit, what matters most, to say it again.

1123
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,060
Beauty, safety, cleanliness,

1124
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,440
lots of other things matter too.

1125
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,873
A whole bunch of things matter.

1126
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:13,560
But if I were to put them in order,

1127
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,870
it's not some like theoretical.

1128
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,401
Well actually I don't know if you know

1129
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:19,234
that the Duma has no power.

1130
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:20,760
It's okay, I get that.

1131
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,670
Freedom of speech matters enormously to me.

1132
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,260
They have less freedom of speech in Russia

1133
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,460
than we do in the United States.

1134
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,830
We are superior to them in that way.

1135
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,710
But you can't tell me that living in a city

1136
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,620
where your 6-year-old daughter can walk to the bus stop

1137
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,530
and ride on a clean bus or ride in a beautiful subway car

1138
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,280
that's on time and not get assaulted, that doesn't matter.

1139
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,980
No, that matters almost more than anything actually.

1140
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,090
And we can have both.

1141
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:49,230
And like the normal regime defenders and morons,

1142
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,207
Jon Stewart or whatever he is calling himself, they're like,

1143
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:54,060
"Whoa, that's the price of freedom."

1144
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,680
Like people shitting on the sidewalk

1145
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,580
is the price of freedom.

1146
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,600
It's like you can't fool me

1147
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,060
because I've lived here for 54 years.

1148
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,220
I know that it's not the price of freedom,

1149
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,090
'cause I lived in a country

1150
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:06,540
that was both free and clean and orderly.

1151
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,040
So, that's not a trade off I think I have to make.

1152
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:12,480
That is the beauty of being a little bit older

1153
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,910
because you're like, no, I remember that actually.

1154
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,320
It wasn't what you're saying.

1155
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,506
We didn't have racial segregation in 1985.

1156
00:45:19,506 --> 00:45:22,470
It was a really nice country that kind of respected itself.

1157
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,990
I was here and I think with younger people

1158
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,542
you can tell 'em that and they're like,

1159
00:45:26,542 --> 00:45:29,280
well 1985 you were selling slaves in Madison Square Garden.

1160
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,320
It's like no, they weren't.

1161
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,430
You're going to Madison Square Garden

1162
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,950
and not stepping over a single fentanyl addict.

1163
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:35,783
- It is true.

1164
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:37,080
There doesn't have to be a trade off

1165
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,620
between cleanliness and freedom of speech.

1166
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,390
But it is also true that in dictatorships, cleanliness is,

1167
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,580
and architectural design is easier to achieve

1168
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,730
and perfect and often is done, so you can show off,

1169
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:54,330
look how great our cities are while you're suppressing.

1170
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,870
- Worse, of course, I agree with that vehemently.

1171
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,560
This is not a defense of the Russian system at all.

1172
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,620
And if I felt that way, I would not only move there,

1173
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,480
but I would announce I was moving there.

1174
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,830
I'm not ashamed of my views.

1175
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,330
I never have been.

1176
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,440
And for all the people who are trying

1177
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,196
to impute secret motives to my words,

1178
00:46:13,196 --> 00:46:15,060
I'm like the one person in America

1179
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,110
you don't need to do that with.

1180
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,810
If you think I'm a racist, ask me and I'll tell you.

1181
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,190
- Are you a racist?

1182
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,121
- No, I'm a sexist though. (laughs)

1183
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:24,346
- All right, great.

1184
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:25,560
- Anyway, no, but if I was like

1185
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,410
a defender of Vladimir Putin,

1186
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,830
I would just say I'm defending Vladimir Putin now, I'm not.

1187
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,620
I am attacking our leaders

1188
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,220
and I'm grieving over the low expectations of our people.

1189
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,500
You don't need to put up with this, you don't need to put up

1190
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,033
with foreign invaders stealing from you,

1191
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:47,370
occupying your kids' school.

1192
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,690
Your kids can't get an education

1193
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,730
because people from foreign countries broke our laws

1194
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,070
and showed up here and they've taken over the school.

1195
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,837
That's not a feature of freedom actually,

1196
00:46:55,837 --> 00:46:57,360
that's the opposite.

1197
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,760
That's what enslavement looks like.

1198
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,150
And so I'm just saying raise your expectations a little bit.

1199
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,510
You can have a clean, functional, safe country.

1200
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:07,740
Crime is totally optional.

1201
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,440
Crime is something our leaders decide to have or not have.

1202
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,200
It's not something that just appears organically.

1203
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,210
I wrote a book about crime 30 years ago.

1204
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,070
I thought a lot about this.

1205
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,980
You have as much crime as you put up with, period.

1206
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,700
And it doesn't make you less free to not tolerate murder.

1207
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,883
In fact, it makes you unfree to have a lot of murders.

1208
00:47:28,122 --> 00:47:32,107
And so I just, but it makes me sad that people are like,

1209
00:47:32,107 --> 00:47:34,320
"Well, you know, I guess this is,

1210
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,587
I can't like live in New York City anymore

1211
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,750
'cause of inflation and filth and illegal aliens

1212
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,490
and people shooting each other,"

1213
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:46,490
but I'm glad because this is vibrant and strong and free."

1214
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,550
It's like that's not freedom actually at all.

1215
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:52,080
- Your point is well taken.

1216
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,740
You can have both, but do you regret-

1217
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:55,710
- We had both. - [Lex] Yes.

1218
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,122
- That's the point.

1219
00:47:57,122 --> 00:47:57,955
We had both, I saw it.

1220
00:47:57,955 --> 00:48:02,490
- Do you regret to a degree using the Moscow subway

1221
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,890
and the grocery store as a mechanism

1222
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,210
by which to make that point?

1223
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:10,893
- No, I mean I thought, I mean look, I'm one

1224
00:48:10,893 --> 00:48:15,300
of the more unselfaware people you will ever interview.

1225
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,300
So to ask me how will this be perceived?

1226
00:48:21,142 --> 00:48:23,284
(laughs) I mean, I literally have no idea

1227
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:25,050
and kind of limited interest.

1228
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,370
But I was so shocked by it.

1229
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:31,290
I was so shocked by it.

1230
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,400
And there were two.

1231
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,830
And to the extent I regret anything

1232
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,620
and am to blame for anything, it would be not.

1233
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,270
And I've done this a lot, not giving it context,

1234
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:41,700
not fully explaining why are we doing this?

1235
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,250
The grocery store, I was shocked by the prices

1236
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,121
and yes, I'm familiar with exchange rates,

1237
00:48:46,121 --> 00:48:49,677
but very familiar with exchange rates, but those don't,

1238
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,840
and I adjusted them for exchange rates.

1239
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,650
And this is two years into sanctions,

1240
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,720
total isolation from the West.

1241
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,600
So I would expect, in fact, I did expect until I got there

1242
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,950
that the supply chains would be crushed.

1243
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,110
How do you get good stuff

1244
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:06,783
if you don't have access to Western markets?

1245
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,550
And I didn't fully get the answer

1246
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,770
'cause I was occupied doing other things when I was there.

1247
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,312
But somehow they have, and that's the point.

1248
00:49:13,312 --> 00:49:15,775
And they haven't had the supply chains problems

1249
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,490
that I predicted.

1250
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,148
In other words, sanctions haven't made the country

1251
00:49:20,148 --> 00:49:22,890
noticeably worse, okay?

1252
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:23,850
So again, this is commentary

1253
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,800
in the United States and our policymakers.

1254
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,510
Why are we doing this?

1255
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,430
It's forcing the rest of the world

1256
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,010
into a block against us called BRICS.

1257
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,660
They're getting off the US dollar.

1258
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:36,030
That will mean a lot of dollars are gonna come back here

1259
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,820
and destroy our economy and impoverish this country.

1260
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,340
So the consequences, the stakes were really high,

1261
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,360
they're huge.

1262
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,280
And we're not even hurting Russia.

1263
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,660
It's like, what the hell are we doing?

1264
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:47,610
One, on the subway.

1265
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,580
That Subway was built by Joseph Stalin

1266
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,440
right before the Second World War.

1267
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,713
I'm not endorsing Stalin obviously.

1268
00:49:55,713 --> 00:49:58,025
Stalinism is the thing that I hate

1269
00:49:58,025 --> 00:50:00,003
and I don't want to come to my country.

1270
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,690
I'm making the obvious point that for over 80 years

1271
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,400
you've had these frescoes and chandeliers.

1272
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,319
Maybe they've been redone or whatever,

1273
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,200
but like somehow the society has been able to not destroy

1274
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,610
what its ancestors built.

1275
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:13,174
The things that are worth having.

1276
00:50:13,174 --> 00:50:14,670
And they're a lot.

1277
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:16,853
And that, like why don't we have that?

1278
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:20,820
And even on a much more terrestrial plane,

1279
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,860
like, why can't I have a subway station like that?

1280
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,060
Why can't my children

1281
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,580
who live in New York City ride the subway?

1282
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,529
A lot of people I know who live in New York City

1283
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,120
are afraid to ride the subway.

1284
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,530
Young women especially.

1285
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:32,490
That's freedom?

1286
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,378
No, again, it's slavery.

1287
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:38,310
And how can, if Putin can do this, why can't we?

1288
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,213
Like what?

1289
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,360
In other words, I mean this is like so obvious.

1290
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,500
I'm a traitor.

1291
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,670
Okay, so if I'm calling for American citizens

1292
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,800
to demand more from their government

1293
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,600
and higher standards for their own society,

1294
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,660
and remember that just 30 years ago we had a much different

1295
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,334
and much happier and cleaner and healthier society

1296
00:50:57,334 --> 00:51:00,720
where everyone wasn't fat with diabetes at 40

1297
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,863
from poisoned food.

1298
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,100
Like how is the, I'm not a traitor to my country.

1299
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,595
I'm a defender of my country.

1300
00:51:07,595 --> 00:51:08,490
And by the way, the people calling me a traitor,

1301
00:51:08,490 --> 00:51:11,490
they're all like, you know, whatever.

1302
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,080
They're not, I would not say they're people

1303
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,819
who put America's interest first. (chuckles)

1304
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:16,652
To put it mildly.

1305
00:51:16,652 --> 00:51:17,485
- There's many elements.

1306
00:51:17,485 --> 00:51:19,293
Like you said, you don't like Stalinism.

1307
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,070
You're a student of history.

1308
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:26,370
Central planning is good at building subways

1309
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,113
in a way that's really nice.

1310
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,550
The thing that accounts for New York subways, by the way,

1311
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,080
there's a lot of really positive things

1312
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:36,060
about New York subways, not cleanliness,

1313
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,730
but the efficiency, like the accessibility

1314
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:42,210
of how wide it spreads.

1315
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:45,090
Now the New York network is incredible.

1316
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:49,110
But Moscow under different metrics,

1317
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,490
results of a capitalist system.

1318
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,440
And you actually said that you don't think US

1319
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,640
is quite a capitalist system,

1320
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,647
which is an interesting question itself.

1321
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:56,480
- That's true.

1322
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,630
We have more central planning here than they do in Russia.

1323
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,800
- No, that's not true.

1324
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,760
- Of course it is.

1325
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,720
- You think that's true.

1326
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,250
- The climate agenda, of course.

1327
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,590
They're telling the US government

1328
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,320
has in league with a couple of big companies,

1329
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,160
decided to change the way we produce and consume energy.

1330
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,140
There's no popular outcry for that.

1331
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,480
There's never been any mass movement

1332
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,710
of Americans who's like, I just,

1333
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:18,330
I hate my gasoline powered engine.

1334
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:19,590
No more diesel.

1335
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,550
That has been central planning.

1336
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,020
That is central planning.

1337
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,550
And you see it up and down our economy.

1338
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,170
There's no free market in the United States.

1339
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:27,540
You get crossways with the government, you're done.

1340
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,144
If you're at scale.

1341
00:52:29,144 --> 00:52:30,526
I mean maybe if you've got a barber shop

1342
00:52:30,526 --> 00:52:31,659
or a liquor store or something,

1343
00:52:31,659 --> 00:52:35,130
but even then you're regulated by politicians.

1344
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,730
And so no, I actually am for free markets.

1345
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,720
I hate monopolies.

1346
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,910
Our economy is dominated by monopolies.

1347
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,080
Completely dominated-

1348
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:43,913
- Like, what do you mean?

1349
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:47,940
- Google, what percentage of search does Google have? 90.

1350
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,070
Google's a monopoly by any definition.

1351
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,510
And Google is just rich enough

1352
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,990
to continue doing whatever it wants in violation of US law.

1353
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:58,590
So there's no monopoly in Russia as big as Google.

1354
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,450
I'm not, again, defending the Russian system.

1355
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,050
I'm calling for return to our old system, which was sensible

1356
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:07,243
and moderate and put the needs of Americans

1357
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:10,440
at least somewhere in the top 10, (laughs)

1358
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,940
somewhere in the top 10.

1359
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,860
I'm not saying that Standard Oil

1360
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,680
was like interested in the welfare of average Americans,

1361
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,220
but I am saying that there was a constituency

1362
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,530
in our political system, in the Congress for example,

1363
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,558
different presidential candidates were like,

1364
00:53:24,558 --> 00:53:25,680
"No, wait a second, what is this doing to people?

1365
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,790
Is it good for people or not?"

1366
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:28,500
There's not even a conversation about that.

1367
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,310
It's like, shut up and submit to AI and no offense,

1368
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:34,116
and so I'm just- - Offense taken.

1369
00:53:34,116 --> 00:53:35,520
(Tucker laughing)

1370
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,578
I'll write, we will get you.

1371
00:53:37,578 --> 00:53:39,150
When it's stronger enough. - Yeah.

1372
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,375
I have no doubt.

1373
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:41,208
- You'll be the first one to go.

1374
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:42,330
- As a white man, I just won't even exist anymore.

1375
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:44,113
- Right, so much to say on that one.

1376
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:47,220
- I bet when you google my picture 20 years from now,

1377
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,603
it'll be a black chick.

1378
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:49,436
(Lex chuckling)

1379
00:53:49,436 --> 00:53:51,067
- A hundred percent.

1380
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:52,969
- Well, I hope she's attractive.

1381
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:53,802
- I hope so too.

1382
00:53:53,802 --> 00:53:56,023
It'd probably be an upgrade. (laughs)

1383
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,550
- So, well, the central planning point

1384
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,650
is really interesting, but I just don't,

1385
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,570
I don't know where you're coming from.

1386
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:05,073
There's a capitalist system.

1387
00:54:06,461 --> 00:54:08,550
I mean the United States is one

1388
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,470
of the most successful capitalist system

1389
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,827
in the history of earth, so to say-

1390
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:14,580
- What's the most successful,

1391
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,350
I'm just saying that I think it's changed a lot

1392
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,380
in the last 15 years and that we need to update

1393
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,240
our assumptions about what we're seeing.

1394
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,073
- [Lex] Sure.

1395
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:23,070
- And that's true up and down.

1396
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,030
That's true with everything.

1397
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,440
It's true with your neighbor's children

1398
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,550
who you haven't seen in three years

1399
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,267
and they come home from Wesleyan and you're like,

1400
00:54:28,267 --> 00:54:29,640
"Oh, you've grown."

1401
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,950
That is true for the world around us as well.

1402
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:34,320
And most of our assumptions about immigration,

1403
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,120
about our economy, about our tax system

1404
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,660
are completely outdated if you compare them

1405
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,490
to the current reality.

1406
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:43,620
And so I'm just for updating my files

1407
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,180
and I have a big advantage over you

1408
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,910
because I am middle aged and so I don't-

1409
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,650
- You've called yourself old so many times

1410
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,483
throughout this time.

1411
00:54:50,483 --> 00:54:51,570
- I don't trust my perceptions of things.

1412
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,330
So I'm constantly trying to be like, is that true?

1413
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,450
I should go there, I should see it.

1414
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:02,450
And I guess just in the end, I trust direct perceptions.

1415
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,170
Like I don't trust the internet actually.

1416
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,960
Wikipedia is a joke.

1417
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,120
Wikipedia could not be more dishonest.

1418
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,560
It's certainly in the political categories

1419
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,940
or things that I know a lot about.

1420
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,610
Occasionally I'll read an entry written about something

1421
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:19,410
that I saw or know the people involved and I'm like,

1422
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,310
well, that's a complete liar.

1423
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,170
You left out the most important fact.

1424
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:23,820
And it's like, it's not a reliable guide

1425
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,800
to reality or history.

1426
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,150
And that will accelerate with AI

1427
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,950
where history or perception of the past

1428
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,970
is completely controlled and distorted.

1429
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:35,070
So I think just getting out there and seeing stuff

1430
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,250
and seeing that Moscow was not what I thought it would be,

1431
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,920
which was a smoldering ruin.

1432
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,603
Rats in a garbage dump.

1433
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,970
It was nicer than New York.

1434
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,832
What the hell?

1435
00:55:46,832 --> 00:55:48,540
- Direct data is good, but it's challenging.

1436
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:51,090
For example, if you talk to a lot of people in Moscow

1437
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,570
or in Russia and you ask 'em is there a censorship?

1438
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:56,460
They will usually say yes, there is.

1439
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,840
- Oh yeah, of course there is.

1440
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,625
Well, I agree.

1441
00:55:59,625 --> 00:56:03,000
I mean, just to be clear, I'm not,

1442
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,500
I have no plans to move to Russia.

1443
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,110
I think I would probably be arrested if I moved to Russia.

1444
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:11,700
Ed Snowden, who is the most famous sort of openness,

1445
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,800
transparency, advocate in the world,

1446
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,090
I would say along with Assange doesn't wanna live in Russia.

1447
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,250
He's had problems with the Putin government.

1448
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,420
He's attacked Putin.

1449
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,320
They don't like it.

1450
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,020
I mean, I get it, I get it.

1451
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,590
I'm just saying, what are the lessons for us?

1452
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,910
And the main lesson is we are being lied to

1453
00:56:32,157 --> 00:56:36,810
like in a way that's bewildering and very upsetting.

1454
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,597
I was mad about it all eight days I was there,

1455
00:56:38,597 --> 00:56:40,530
'cause I feel like I'm better informed than most people,

1456
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,030
'cause it's my job to be informed

1457
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,010
and I'm skeptical of everything.

1458
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:46,009
And yet I was completely hoodwinked by it.

1459
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:49,080
I would just recommend to everyone watching this

1460
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,480
like you think like if you're really interested,

1461
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,190
if you're one of those people and I'm not one,

1462
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,300
but who's like waking up every day

1463
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,600
and you've got a Ukrainian flag on your mailbox or whatever,

1464
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,590
you're Ukrainian lapel pen or it's like absurd theater.

1465
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,750
But if you like sincerely care about Ukraine or Russia

1466
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,330
or whatever, why don't you just hop on a plane

1467
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,790
for 800 bucks and go see it, okay?

1468
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,160
That doesn't occur to anyone to do that.

1469
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,740
And I know it's time consuming and kind of expensive

1470
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,237
sort of, not really, but you benefit so much.

1471
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:19,650
I mean I could bore you for like eight hours.

1472
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,080
And I know you've had this experience

1473
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,880
where you think you know what something is

1474
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,340
or you think you know who someone is

1475
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,190
and then you have direct experience of that place or person

1476
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:32,400
and you realize all your preconceptions were totally wrong.

1477
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,960
They were controlled by somebody else.

1478
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,330
Like you'd know, in fact, I won't betray confidences,

1479
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,860
but off the air we're talking about somebody

1480
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,900
and you said, I couldn't believe the person

1481
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,460
was not at all like what I thought.

1482
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:42,360
Well, that's happened to me-

1483
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,350
- In the positive direction.

1484
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:45,335
- In the positive direction.

1485
00:57:45,335 --> 00:57:47,220
By the way, for me it's almost always in that direction.

1486
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:49,950
Most people I meet and I've had the great privilege

1487
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:54,360
of meeting a lot of people over all this time,

1488
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,500
they're way better than you think

1489
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,390
or they're more complicated or whatever.

1490
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:02,390
But the point is a direct experience unmediated by liars.

1491
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,140
There's no substitute for that.

1492
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,450
- Well, on that point, direct experience in Ukraine.

1493
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:10,230
So I visited Ukraine and witnessed a lot

1494
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:11,610
of the same things you witnessed in Moscow.

1495
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,110
So first of all, beautiful architecture.

1496
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:13,943
- [Tucker] Yes.

1497
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:17,100
- And this is a country that's really in war,

1498
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,600
so it's not- - Oh for real.

1499
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,420
- Like for real where most of the men

1500
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,360
are either volunteering or fighting in the war

1501
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,060
and there's actual tanks in the streets

1502
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,280
that are going into your major city of Kyiv,

1503
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,160
and still the supply chains are working.

1504
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,432
- [Tucker] Yes.

1505
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:34,560
- The handful of months after the start of the war

1506
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,150
everything is working.

1507
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,150
The restaurants are amazing.

1508
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:43,150
The most of the people are able to do some kind of job like,

1509
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,333
like the life goes on.

1510
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,050
Cleanliness, like you mentioned.

1511
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,583
- I love that. - Security.

1512
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,840
Like it's incredible.

1513
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,120
Like there's the crime went to zero.

1514
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,640
They gave all guns to everybody.

1515
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,710
The Texas strategy. - It does work.

1516
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,180
- Yeah, when you witness it, you realize,

1517
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,490
okay, there's something to these people.

1518
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,080
There's something to this country

1519
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,720
that they're not as corrupt as you might hear.

1520
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,390
You hear that Russia is corrupt, Ukraine is corrupt.

1521
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:11,220
You assume it's just all gonna go to shit.

1522
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,780
- Well, so that's been, and I haven't been to Ukraine

1523
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,370
and I've certainly tried and they put me

1524
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,590
on some kill him immediately list.

1525
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,150
So I can't, I've tried to interview Zelensky.

1526
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:18,983
He keeps denouncing me.

1527
00:59:18,983 --> 00:59:20,070
I just want an interview with him.

1528
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:21,960
He won't unfortunately. - [Lex] Yeah.

1529
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,793
- I would love to do it.

1530
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:24,450
- I hope you do. - I hope I do too.

1531
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,930
But one of the things that bothers me most,

1532
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:30,150
I love to hear that what you just said about Kyiv,

1533
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:31,278
but I'm not really surprised.

1534
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:36,278
One of the things that I'm most ashamed of is the bigotry

1535
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,960
that I felt towards Slavic people, also toward Muslims.

1536
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,610
I'll just be totally honest because I lived

1537
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,187
through decades of propaganda from NBC News

1538
00:59:44,187 --> 00:59:48,030
and CNN where I worked about this or that group of people

1539
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,200
and they're horrible or whatever.

1540
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,490
And then you wind...

1541
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:53,160
And I kind of believed it, and I see it now.

1542
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,770
Like we can't even put the word Russia

1543
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:57,450
at Wimbledon 'cause it's so offensive.

1544
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,910
Well what does the tennis player have to do with it?

1545
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:00,810
Did he invade Ukraine?

1546
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,250
I don't think he did.

1547
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,860
Stealing all these business guys yachts

1548
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,060
and denouncing with oligarchs.

1549
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,020
Like what do they have to do with it?

1550
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,430
You know, whatever.

1551
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,300
Here's my point.

1552
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,570
The idea that like a whole group of people is just evil

1553
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,099
because of their blood.

1554
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:15,293
I just don't believe that.

1555
01:00:15,293 --> 01:00:17,430
I think it's immoral to think that.

1556
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,680
And I can just tell you my own experience

1557
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,003
after eight days there.

1558
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,680
I think it's a really interesting culture, Slavic culture,

1559
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:28,770
which is shared by the way, by Russia and Ukraine of course.

1560
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:31,020
They're first cousins at the most distant

1561
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:36,020
and I found 'em really smart and interesting and informed.

1562
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,116
I didn't understand a lot of what they're saying

1563
01:00:38,116 --> 01:00:38,949
and don't understand the way their minds work,

1564
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:42,720
'cause I'm American but it wasn't a thin culture,

1565
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,180
it's a thick culture, you know?

1566
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:46,197
And I admire that.

1567
01:00:46,197 --> 01:00:47,520
And I wish I could go to Ukraine.

1568
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,990
I would go tomorrow.

1569
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:51,840
- So I think after you did the interview with Putin,

1570
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,540
you put a clip I think on, "TCN"

1571
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,260
where like your sort of analysis afterwards.

1572
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,640
- Yeah, it wasn't much of an analysis.

1573
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,140
- No, but what stood out to me

1574
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,671
is you were kind of talking shit about Putin a little bit.

1575
01:01:03,671 --> 01:01:04,504
- Yeah.

1576
01:01:04,504 --> 01:01:05,337
- Like you were criticizing him.

1577
01:01:05,337 --> 01:01:06,170
- Why wouldn't I?

1578
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,590
- It spoke to the thing that you mentioned,

1579
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,683
which is you weren't afraid.

1580
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:14,190
Now the question I want to ask is,

1581
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:16,590
it'd be pretty badass if you went to the supermarket

1582
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,000
and made the point you were making,

1583
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,890
but also criticize Putin, right?

1584
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:22,140
Criticize that there is a lack of a freedom of speech

1585
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,610
and freedom of the press.

1586
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,560
- In the supermarket?

1587
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,393
- Yes.

1588
01:01:26,393 --> 01:01:28,170
- Oh, you mean if I also said that.

1589
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:32,070
Well, yeah, I mean I of course I think that, I'm not.

1590
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:35,850
So I guess part of it is that I'm a little,

1591
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:38,048
because I have such a low opinion

1592
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:40,973
of the commentariat in the United States

1593
01:01:40,973 --> 01:01:43,320
and the news organizations which really do

1594
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,450
just work for the US government.

1595
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:47,970
I mean I really see them as I did

1596
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:50,010
Izvestia and Pravda in the 80s.

1597
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,420
Like they're just organs of the government

1598
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:52,590
and I think they're contemptible.

1599
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:54,090
And I think the people who work there are contemptible.

1600
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:54,930
And I say that as someone

1601
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,000
who knows them really well personally.

1602
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,650
I think they're disgusting.

1603
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,870
That I'm a little bit cut off kind of

1604
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:02,427
from what people are saying about me

1605
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:03,535
'cause I'm not interested.

1606
01:02:03,535 --> 01:02:05,250
So, I try not to be defensive.

1607
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,530
Like see I'm not a tool of Putin.

1608
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:09,960
But the idea that I'd be flaking for Putin

1609
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,932
when you know my relatives fought in the Revolutionary War,

1610
01:02:13,932 --> 01:02:15,782
like I'm as American as you could be.

1611
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,360
It's like crazy to me.

1612
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,420
And Applebaum calls me a traitor.

1613
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,290
I'm like, "Okay, right."

1614
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,670
It's just like so dumb.

1615
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:25,440
But no, of course they don't have...

1616
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,320
No country has freedom of speech other than us.

1617
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,880
Canada doesn't have it.

1618
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,830
Great Britain definitely doesn't have it.

1619
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,660
France, Netherlands, these are countries

1620
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,910
I spend a lot of time in.

1621
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:37,380
And Russia certainly doesn't have it.

1622
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,690
So, that's why I don't live there.

1623
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,120
I'm just saying our sanctions don't work.

1624
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,377
That's all I was saying.

1625
01:02:43,377 --> 01:02:46,290
And we don't have to live like animals.

1626
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,820
We can live with dignity.

1627
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,230
Even the Russians can do it.

1628
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:50,280
That's kind of what I was saying.

1629
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,238
Even the Russians under Vladimir freaking Putin

1630
01:02:53,238 --> 01:02:54,420
can live like this.

1631
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,342
And no, it's not a feature of dictatorship.

1632
01:02:56,342 --> 01:02:59,280
That's the most, I think discouraging

1633
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,820
and most dishonest line by people like Jon Stewart

1634
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,300
who really are trying to prepare the population

1635
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,060
for accepting a lot less.

1636
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:11,600
He is really a tool of the regime in a sinister way.

1637
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,650
It always has been.

1638
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,450
Like, how dare you expect that?

1639
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,460
What are you a Stalinist?

1640
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,770
It's like, no, I'm an American.

1641
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:20,850
I'm like a decent person.

1642
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:22,110
I just wanna be able to walk

1643
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:23,640
to the grocery store without being murdered.

1644
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,473
Is that too much to...

1645
01:03:24,473 --> 01:03:26,130
Shut up then, you don't believe in freedom.

1646
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,530
It's really dark if you think about it.

1647
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,030
- So there is a fundamental way

1648
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:32,970
which you wanted Americans to expect more.

1649
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:34,710
- You don't have to live like this.

1650
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,488
We don't have to live like this.

1651
01:03:36,488 --> 01:03:38,640
You don't have to accept it, you don't.

1652
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,440
And everyone's afraid in this country,

1653
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,640
they're gonna be shut down by the tech oligarchs

1654
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,220
or have the FBI show up at their houses or go to jail.

1655
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,800
And people are legit afraid of that in the United States.

1656
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,120
And my feeling is so like show a little courage.

1657
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,060
Like what is it worth to you for your grandchildren

1658
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,070
to live in a free prosperous country?

1659
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,312
It should be worth more than your comfort.

1660
01:04:01,312 --> 01:04:02,550
That's how I feel.

1661
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:05,430
- We should make clear that by many measures,

1662
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:08,820
you look at the world press freedom index, you're right,

1663
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:13,820
US is not at the top, Norway is, US scores 71.

1664
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:18,388
Same as Gambia in West Africa.

1665
01:04:18,388 --> 01:04:19,221
- Really.

1666
01:04:19,221 --> 01:04:20,687
So let me just ask- - Hold on, hold on,

1667
01:04:20,687 --> 01:04:21,836
hold on a second, hold on a second,

1668
01:04:21,836 --> 01:04:22,744
hold on a second.

1669
01:04:22,744 --> 01:04:23,577
- [Tucker] (laughs) Now you're making me laugh.

1670
01:04:23,577 --> 01:04:27,013
- Ukraine is 61 and Russia is 35.

1671
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:29,610
The lower it is the worst.

1672
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,060
Close to China at 23 and North Korea at the very bottom, 22.

1673
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,880
- Didn't Ukraine put Gonzalo Lira in jail till he died

1674
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,020
for criticizing the government.

1675
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,340
How can they have a high press?

1676
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,231
- Yes, that's why there are 61 out of zero.

1677
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:43,020
- But I'm saying look, I don't know what the criteria are

1678
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,120
they're using to arrive at that.

1679
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,310
But I know press freedom when I see it,

1680
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,110
I try to practice it, which is saying

1681
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:50,610
what you think is true,

1682
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,490
correcting yourself when you've been shown to be wrong,

1683
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,400
as I have many times, being as honest

1684
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,100
as you can be all the time and not being afraid.

1685
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:02,100
And those are wholly absent in my country, wholly absent.

1686
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,750
People are afraid in the news business.

1687
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,690
I would know since I've spent my life work in there

1688
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:08,610
and they're afraid to tell the truth.

1689
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:09,990
They're under an enormous amount of pressure

1690
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,550
and a lot of them have little kids and mortgages.

1691
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,250
I've been there, so I have sympathy.

1692
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,440
But they go along with things like you would,

1693
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:20,430
you are not allowed if you stand up at any cable channel,

1694
01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:21,810
any cable channel in the United States

1695
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:25,320
and say, wait a second, how did the Ukrainian government

1696
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,961
throw a US citizen into prison until he died

1697
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:31,170
for criticizing the Ukrainian government?

1698
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,490
And we're paying for that.

1699
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:33,930
That's why it's offensive to me.

1700
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,170
We're paying for it.

1701
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,710
And that happens all the time around the world of course.

1702
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:38,970
But this is a US citizen

1703
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:43,050
and we're paying the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.

1704
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:46,200
Like, we are the Ukrainian government at this point.

1705
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:49,800
And like if you said that on TV on any channel,

1706
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,020
well, you'd lose your job for that.

1707
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,580
So like that's not, I don't care.

1708
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,793
Or Norway is at the top, really Norway.

1709
01:05:55,793 --> 01:05:57,870
If I went to nor Norwegian television

1710
01:05:57,870 --> 01:06:00,273
and said NATO blew up Nord Stream, which it did,

1711
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,690
NATO blew up Nord Stream, the United States government

1712
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:05,970
with the help of other governments blew up,

1713
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:07,080
committed the largest act

1714
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,820
of industrial terrorism in history.

1715
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:10,470
And by the way, the largest environmental crime,

1716
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,663
the largest emission of CO2, methane.

1717
01:06:13,775 --> 01:06:15,810
Could I keep my job? No.

1718
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:16,643
So how is that a free-

1719
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:17,476
- We don't know that.

1720
01:06:17,476 --> 01:06:18,390
I mean the whole point of-

1721
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,350
- In Norway? - [Lex] Yes.

1722
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,730
- Well as a Scandinavian I can tell you

1723
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:22,920
they would not put up with that in Norway for a second.

1724
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:23,753
- [Lex] It's been a while.

1725
01:06:23,753 --> 01:06:26,340
- You deviating for the majority? No. (laughs)

1726
01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:31,340
- Well, but in it's deviating maybe is frowned upon, but-

1727
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,640
- [Tucker] Frowned upon, yeah.

1728
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,610
- But do you have the freedom to say it if you do deviate?

1729
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:36,450
That's the question.

1730
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,440
- Can you keep your job?

1731
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,718
That's one measurement of it.

1732
01:06:38,718 --> 01:06:39,601
- [Lex] You can keep your job, yeah.

1733
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:40,434
- Yeah, it's not the only measurement.

1734
01:06:40,434 --> 01:06:41,267
Obviously being thrown into prison

1735
01:06:41,267 --> 01:06:42,570
is much worse than losing your job.

1736
01:06:42,570 --> 01:06:44,280
I've been fired a number of times

1737
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,353
for saying what I think, by the way.

1738
01:06:46,353 --> 01:06:48,180
And it's fine. I've enjoyed it.

1739
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:49,470
I don't mind being fired.

1740
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:52,950
I've always become a better person after it happened.

1741
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:55,290
But it is one measurement of freedom.

1742
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:58,170
If you have the theoretical right to do something,

1743
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,940
but no practical ability to do it,

1744
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:00,957
do you have the right to do it?

1745
01:07:00,957 --> 01:07:03,480
And the answer is not really actually.

1746
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,920
- You mentioned Jon Stewart,

1747
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,810
the two of you have a bit of a history,

1748
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:08,027
I don't know if you've seen it,

1749
01:07:08,027 --> 01:07:12,780
but he kind of grilled your supermarket and subway videos,

1750
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,753
have you got a chance to see it?

1751
01:07:13,753 --> 01:07:18,150
- I haven't seen it, but someone characterized it to me,

1752
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:20,550
which is why I pivoted against it early in our conversation

1753
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:24,600
about how the price of freedom is living in filth and chaos.

1754
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:26,610
- Yeah, that was essentially it.

1755
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:30,120
So in 2004, that's 20 years ago,

1756
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:33,210
Jon Stewart appeared on, "Crossfire," a show he hosted.

1757
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:37,740
And that was kind of a memorable moment.

1758
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:40,273
Can you tell the saga of that as you remember it?

1759
01:07:40,273 --> 01:07:43,290
- I mean for me, you know, as I was saying to you before

1760
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:45,900
about how it takes a long time to digest

1761
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,348
and process and understand what happens to you,

1762
01:07:48,348 --> 01:07:49,680
or at least it does for me.

1763
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,990
I didn't understand that as a particularly significant

1764
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,280
moment while it was happening.

1765
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,110
I just got off a plane from Hawaii.

1766
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,940
I mean I was out of it as usual

1767
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,458
and I was very literal as usual.

1768
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:03,630
And so from my perspective, his criticism of me,

1769
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:07,440
to the extent I remember it, was that I was a partisan.

1770
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:08,273
Well, he had two criticisms.

1771
01:08:08,273 --> 01:08:09,180
One that, "Crossfire," was stupid,

1772
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:10,980
which it certainly was.

1773
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:12,690
In fact, I'd already given my notice

1774
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:16,203
and I was moving on to another company by that point.

1775
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:18,569
"Crossfire" was stupid.

1776
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:21,840
Crossfire didn't help, Crossfire framed everything

1777
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:26,399
as Republican versus Democrat, whatever.

1778
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:27,930
It was not helpful to the public discourse.

1779
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:30,542
I couldn't agree more, and that's why I left.

1780
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,779
So that was part of his critique, fair.

1781
01:08:33,779 --> 01:08:35,970
I'm not sure I would've admitted it at the time

1782
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,229
'cause I worked there and it's sort of hard

1783
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:38,819
to admit you're engaged in an enterprise

1784
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:41,319
that's like fundamentally worthless, which it was.

1785
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:44,880
But his other point was

1786
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,130
that I was somehow a partisan or a mindless partisan,

1787
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,590
which is definitely not true.

1788
01:08:49,590 --> 01:08:50,423
It is true of him.

1789
01:08:50,423 --> 01:08:52,290
He is a mindless partisan.

1790
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,390
But I'm not, and I haven't been for,

1791
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:56,609
I really haven't been since I got back from Baghdad

1792
01:08:56,609 --> 01:08:57,779
at the beginning of the Iraq war

1793
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:00,479
and I realized that the Republican party,

1794
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,779
which I'd voted for my whole life to that point

1795
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:05,620
and had supported in general

1796
01:09:07,495 --> 01:09:11,040
was like pushing this really horrible thing

1797
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,180
that was gonna hurt the United States

1798
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:14,010
which in time it really did.

1799
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:16,319
The Iraq War really hurt the United States.

1800
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,569
And I realized that I had been on the wrong side of that.

1801
01:09:18,569 --> 01:09:20,819
I said so publicly, immediately from Baghdad,

1802
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:23,420
I said that to, The New York Times and I really meant it.

1803
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,450
I mean it now.

1804
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,251
And so to call me partisan,

1805
01:09:26,251 --> 01:09:29,370
you could call me stupid, you could call me wrong.

1806
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,350
I certainly have been wrong, but partisan,

1807
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:33,652
I just didn't think it was a meaningful,

1808
01:09:33,652 --> 01:09:34,500
I mean it's like that's just not true.

1809
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,670
It's the opposite of true.

1810
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:39,365
So I didn't really take it seriously at all.

1811
01:09:39,365 --> 01:09:43,620
And I never thought much of him.

1812
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,720
So I was like, whatever, some buffoon

1813
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,082
jumping around on my show grandstanding.

1814
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:49,950
But I do think it was recorded.

1815
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:51,720
And by the way that happened right at the moment

1816
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,970
that YouTube began, I think that was one

1817
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:54,803
of the first big YouTube video.

1818
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:57,060
It was one of the first big YouTube videos.

1819
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:00,540
So it had a virality that, if that's a word,

1820
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,090
it went everywhere in a way

1821
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,680
that didn't used to happen in cable news.

1822
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,450
I mean, by that point I had, that was 20 years ago.

1823
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:09,480
As you point out, I've been in cable news for nine years.

1824
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:14,480
So in the before 2004, we would say something on television

1825
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:18,060
and then it would kind of, it would be lost.

1826
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:19,440
Like people could claim they heard it.

1827
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,593
But you'd have to go to the,

1828
01:10:20,593 --> 01:10:22,590
I think the University of Tennessee at Knoxville

1829
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:23,910
archives to get it.

1830
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:26,850
Suddenly everything we said would live forever

1831
01:10:26,850 --> 01:10:29,700
on the internet, which is good by the way.

1832
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,533
That's not bad.

1833
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:31,480
But it was a big change for me.

1834
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,250
And I just couldn't believe how widely

1835
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:36,750
that was discussed at the time,

1836
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:40,080
'cause I thought he was not an interesting person.

1837
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,873
I think he is obviously a very unhappy person.

1838
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:46,650
I just didn't take him seriously then and I don't now.

1839
01:10:47,667 --> 01:10:49,140
But, so anyway, that was it.

1840
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,400
It was a smaller thing in my life at the time

1841
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,000
than other people imagined.

1842
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,940
- Okay, you said a lot of words that will make it sound

1843
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:59,670
like you're a bit bitter even if you're not.

1844
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:02,315
So you said unhappy person, partisan person.

1845
01:11:02,315 --> 01:11:03,600
- Well, I think he's an unhappy guy.

1846
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,919
Well, he's definitely partisan for sure.

1847
01:11:05,919 --> 01:11:07,713
- So, can you elaborate why you think he's partisan?

1848
01:11:07,713 --> 01:11:09,329
- Well, so I think that,

1849
01:11:09,329 --> 01:11:11,040
and I see this a lot, not only on the left,

1850
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,740
but people who believe

1851
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,930
that whatever political debate they're engaged in

1852
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:18,570
is the most important debate in the world.

1853
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,030
And so they bring an emotional intensity to those debates

1854
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,230
and they're inevitably disappointed

1855
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:25,650
because no eternal question is solved politically.

1856
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:28,170
So they're kind of on the wrong path, right?

1857
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:29,870
And they're doomed to frustration,

1858
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,180
if they believe that, and many do.

1859
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,120
He certainly does. that whatever the issue is.

1860
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,760
So, "Clarence Thomas should not be Supreme Court justice."

1861
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,720
And the implication is, well,

1862
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,040
if someone else's Supreme Court justice

1863
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,350
we'll live in a fair and happy society.

1864
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,870
But that's just not, it's a false promise.

1865
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:49,320
So I think that people who bring that level of intensity

1866
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,270
to politics are by definition bitter,

1867
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,710
by definition disappointed,

1868
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,960
bitter in the way the disappointed people are.

1869
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,010
And that the real questions are like,

1870
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,510
what happens when you die?

1871
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,710
And how do the people around you feel about you?

1872
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,940
Those are not the only questions in life,

1873
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:04,640
but they're certainly the most important ones.

1874
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,840
And if we're spending a disproportionate amount of time

1875
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,400
on who gets elected to some office,

1876
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,135
not that it's irrelevant, it is relevant,

1877
01:12:10,135 --> 01:12:12,485
but it's not the eternal question.

1878
01:12:12,485 --> 01:12:17,190
And so I feel like he's not the only kind of bitter,

1879
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:20,700
silly person in Washington or in its orbit.

1880
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,403
There are many, and a lot of them are Republicans.

1881
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:25,800
But I just thought it was ironic.

1882
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:26,970
I mean, everything's ironic to me,

1883
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:30,360
but like being called a Russia sympathizer

1884
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,400
by a guy who calls himself Boris,

1885
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,510
like, it just made me laugh. (chuckles)

1886
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,740
No one else has ever laughed at that.

1887
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,050
Boris Johnson's real name is not Boris as you know.

1888
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:39,604
He calls himself Boris, it's his middle name.

1889
01:12:39,604 --> 01:12:42,120
And so like if you call yourself Boris,

1890
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,013
you don't really have standing to attack anyone else

1891
01:12:44,013 --> 01:12:46,271
as a Russia defender, right?

1892
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:47,790
That's my, I think that's funny.

1893
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:49,623
No one else, as I noted does.

1894
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:54,360
But Jon Stewart, like, you know,

1895
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:56,520
if there are a lot of things

1896
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:57,353
you could say about me,

1897
01:12:57,353 --> 01:12:59,400
but he's much more partisan than I am,

1898
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,950
so to call me a partisan, it's like what?

1899
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:04,590
- He would probably say that he's not a partisan,

1900
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,680
that he's a comedian who's looking for the humor

1901
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,150
and the absurdity of the system.

1902
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,170
That's a dumb- - On both sides.

1903
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:13,650
He's a very serious person in this, I will say this.

1904
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:15,450
And he shares this quality with a lot of comedians.

1905
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:16,750
I know a lot of comedians.

1906
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:18,720
I know a cross sectioned people

1907
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,190
just having done this job for a long time.

1908
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:24,360
And a lot of 'em are very serious, like about their views

1909
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,700
and they have a lot of emotional intensity

1910
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,410
and he certainly is in that category.

1911
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:30,540
He's not, that's like the silliest thing.

1912
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:31,590
Yeah, he's a comedian for sure.

1913
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,540
He can be very funny for sure.

1914
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:34,563
He has talent, no doubt about it.

1915
01:13:34,563 --> 01:13:36,450
I've never denied that.

1916
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:40,187
But he's motivated by his moral views,

1917
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:44,658
this is right, that is wrong.

1918
01:13:44,658 --> 01:13:48,600
And I just think that's, it's a misapplied passion.

1919
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,440
- Well, do you think I'm just a comedian, is-

1920
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,923
- I don't think any serious person thinks that.

1921
01:13:53,923 --> 01:13:55,823
I mean, if you're just a comedian, be.

1922
01:13:57,012 --> 01:14:00,603
And look, I'm not trying to claim, I couldn't claim

1923
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,460
that I haven't said a lot of dumb things.

1924
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,028
And one of the dumbest things I ever said

1925
01:14:04,028 --> 01:14:09,028
was when he was on our set lecturing me, he's a moralizer,

1926
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:12,000
which I also just don't really care for

1927
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,814
as an aesthetic matter.

1928
01:14:13,814 --> 01:14:16,080
But he was lecturing me about something

1929
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:19,200
and I said, "I thought you were here to tell jokes,"

1930
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,850
which I shouldn't have said

1931
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:22,560
because he wasn't there to tell jokes.

1932
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:23,967
He was there to lecture me.

1933
01:14:23,967 --> 01:14:25,800
And I should have just engaged it directly

1934
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,270
rather than trying to diminish him

1935
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:28,800
by like, you're just a little comedian.

1936
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,870
Well, he doesn't see himself that way.

1937
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,280
But I would just say this,

1938
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,870
Jon Stewart's a defender of power.

1939
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,090
Like Jon Stewart has never criticized.

1940
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:37,860
Like, what's Jon Stewart's view

1941
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:41,058
on the aid we've sent to Ukraine,

1942
01:14:41,058 --> 01:14:41,910
the a hundred billion dollars or whatever.

1943
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:42,900
Like, what happened to that money?

1944
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,790
What happened to the weapons that have bought?

1945
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:46,020
He doesn't care.

1946
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,390
He has the exact same priorities

1947
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:52,140
as the people permanently in charge in Washington.

1948
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,810
So whatever, he doesn't, he's not alone in that.

1949
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:57,570
So does Mika Brzezinski and her husband

1950
01:14:57,570 --> 01:14:59,430
and all the rest of the cast of dummies.

1951
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:03,000
But if you're gonna pretend to be the guy

1952
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,950
who's giving the finger to entrenched power,

1953
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:07,410
you should do it once in a while.

1954
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:09,330
And he never has.

1955
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,130
There's not one time when he said something

1956
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,530
that would be deeply unpopular on, "Morning Joe."

1957
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:14,730
That's all I'm saying.

1958
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:16,200
And so don't call yourself a truth teller.

1959
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,860
You're a court comedian or a flatterer of power.

1960
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,270
Okay, that's fine, there's a role for that,

1961
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:23,610
but don't pretend to be something else.

1962
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:27,540
- I'll just be honest that I watched it just recently,

1963
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:30,218
that video- - From 20 years ago.

1964
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:31,051
- From 20 years ago.

1965
01:15:31,051 --> 01:15:34,230
I watched it initially and I remember very differently.

1966
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,880
I remembered that Jon Stewart

1967
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,610
completely destroyed you in that conversation.

1968
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:43,610
And I watched it and you asked a very good question of him,

1969
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:48,003
which was, and there was no destruction, first of all.

1970
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,730
And you asked a very good question of him,

1971
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:53,790
why, when you got a chance to interview John Kerry,

1972
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:56,310
did you ask a bunch of softball questions?

1973
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,210
- [Tucker] Yeah.

1974
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:00,270
- I thought that was a really fair question.

1975
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:02,910
And then his defense was, "Well, I'm just a comedian."

1976
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,830
- So, I thought that was disingenuous.

1977
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:06,090
And I haven't watched it,

1978
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:08,384
I never have watched a clip one time in my life

1979
01:16:08,384 --> 01:16:11,850
and I don't like to watch myself on television.

1980
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:12,683
I never have.

1981
01:16:13,572 --> 01:16:14,790
And that's my fault.

1982
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,860
And I probably should force myself to watch it though,

1983
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,693
of course I never will.

1984
01:16:17,693 --> 01:16:20,850
But I think the takeaway for me,

1985
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:23,100
which was really interesting and life changing

1986
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:25,410
was I agree with your assessment.

1987
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,600
I'm not just, I've lost a lot of debates.

1988
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,900
I've been humiliated on television, I'm not above that.

1989
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:32,520
It certainly happened to me, it will happen again.

1990
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,123
But I didn't feel like it was a clear win for him at all.

1991
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,350
Maybe a TKO, but it was not a knockout at all.

1992
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,706
And yet it was recorded that way.

1993
01:16:41,706 --> 01:16:42,539
And I remember thinking, "Well, that's kind of weird.

1994
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:43,800
That's not what I remember."

1995
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,700
And then I realized, no,

1996
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,670
Jon Stewart was more popular than I was,

1997
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,560
therefore he was recorded as the winner.

1998
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,390
And that was hard for me to accept

1999
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:52,620
because that struck me as unfair.

2000
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:55,350
You should rate any contest on points.

2001
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,600
Like here are the rules, we're gonna judge the contest

2002
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,310
in the basis of those rules.

2003
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,340
And no, in the end it's just like the more popular guy wins.

2004
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,810
Every TV critic liked Jon Stewart,

2005
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:05,730
every one of 'em hated me, therefore he won.

2006
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,200
And I was like, wow, that, I guess

2007
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,036
I have to accept that reality.

2008
01:17:09,036 --> 01:17:11,771
And you do like the reality of the sunrise,

2009
01:17:11,771 --> 01:17:13,350
you're not in charge of it,

2010
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:14,400
so that's just what it is.

2011
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,200
- Unfortunately, it's a bit darker I think.

2012
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,820
The reason he's seen as the winner

2013
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:19,110
and the reason at the time I saw

2014
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:20,130
as the quote, unquote, "winner,"

2015
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:22,290
is because he was basically shitting on you,

2016
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:25,470
like personal attacks versus engaging ideas.

2017
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:28,110
And it was funny in a dark way

2018
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,730
and like making fun of the bow tie

2019
01:17:29,730 --> 01:17:31,808
and all this kind of stuff. - [Tucker] Fair.

2020
01:17:31,808 --> 01:17:32,641
Bow ties are-

2021
01:17:32,641 --> 01:17:33,474
- I understand.

2022
01:17:33,474 --> 01:17:34,307
- And it was fair to call me a dick.

2023
01:17:34,307 --> 01:17:35,140
I remember he called me a dick.

2024
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:35,977
And I remember even when he said that, I was like,

2025
01:17:35,977 --> 01:17:37,680
"Yeah, I'm definitely a dick."

2026
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,903
Yeah, and that's not my best quality, trust me.

2027
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:42,060
- I think but also to be kind of,

2028
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:45,090
I thought Jon Stewart came off as a giant dick at that time

2029
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:50,090
and I'm a big fan of his and I think he has improved a lot.

2030
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,150
- That may be true.

2031
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:55,311
- We should also say that like people grow, people like-

2032
01:17:55,311 --> 01:17:56,940
- Well, I certainly have or change anyway.

2033
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,823
You hope it's growth, you hope it's not shrinkage.

2034
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,420
- It is cold outside.

2035
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:07,650
- Yeah, I mean look, I haven't followed

2036
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,960
Jon Stewart's career at all.

2037
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:11,010
I don't have a television.

2038
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:13,139
Like I'm pretty cut off from all that stuff,

2039
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:15,239
so I wouldn't really know.

2040
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:20,239
But the measure to me is, are you taking positions

2041
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,130
that are unpopular with the most powerful people

2042
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:24,720
in the world, and how often are you doing it?

2043
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,620
It's super simple.

2044
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:28,780
Not for its own sake, but do you feel free enough

2045
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:34,179
to say to the consensus, I disagree.

2046
01:18:34,179 --> 01:18:36,870
And if you don't, then you're just another toady.

2047
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:38,305
That's my view.

2048
01:18:38,305 --> 01:18:41,250
- Well, I think he probably feels free enough to do it,

2049
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,990
but you're saying he doesn't do it.

2050
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:44,590
- On the big things.

2051
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:48,240
Look, the big things, this is my estimation of it,

2052
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,170
others may disagree.

2053
01:18:49,170 --> 01:18:52,070
The big things are the economy and war, okay?

2054
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:52,903
- [Lex] Yeah.

2055
01:18:52,903 --> 01:18:54,553
- The big things government does can be,

2056
01:18:54,553 --> 01:18:55,980
I mean there are a lot of things government does.

2057
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:57,210
Government does everything at this point.

2058
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:02,210
But where we kill people and how, and for what purpose

2059
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:05,160
and how we organize the economic engine

2060
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,270
that keeps the country afloat.

2061
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:08,130
Those are the two big questions.

2062
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,864
And I hear almost no debate

2063
01:19:09,864 --> 01:19:12,690
about either one of them in the media.

2064
01:19:12,690 --> 01:19:15,308
And I have dissenting views on both of them.

2065
01:19:15,308 --> 01:19:17,653
I mean, I'm mad about the tax code, which I think is unfair.

2066
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:19,103
I don't think we should be...

2067
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:22,740
The fact we've a carried interest loophole in the tax code

2068
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:24,720
and people are claiming that their income

2069
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:27,870
is investment income and they're paying half the tax rate

2070
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,820
as someone who just goes to work every day.

2071
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:34,140
It discourages work, it encourages lending at interest,

2072
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:36,450
which I think is gross personally

2073
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:37,873
I'm against it, sorry.

2074
01:19:37,873 --> 01:19:41,073
And the fact that we're creating chaos around the world,

2075
01:19:41,073 --> 01:19:43,560
like is the saddest thing that's happening right now.

2076
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,480
And nobody feels free to say that, so that's not good.

2077
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,640
- How do you hope the war on Ukraine ends?

2078
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,260
- With a settlement.

2079
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:53,220
With a reasonable settlement.

2080
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:58,220
And what a reasonable settlement is, which is a settlement,

2081
01:19:58,410 --> 01:20:00,000
where both sides feel like they're giving a little,

2082
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,650
but can live with it.

2083
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:04,860
And I mean I was really struck in my conversation

2084
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:09,030
with Putin by how he basically refused

2085
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:11,553
to criticize Joe Biden and to criticize NATO.

2086
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,870
And it is, I will just be honest as an American,

2087
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,840
it would be a little weird to be like pissing on Joe Biden

2088
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,760
with a foreign leader, any foreign leader,

2089
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,380
even though I don't think Joe Biden

2090
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:24,936
is a real person or really president.

2091
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:25,769
I mean the whole thing is ridiculous.

2092
01:20:25,769 --> 01:20:27,420
But still, he is the American president technically.

2093
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:30,210
And I don't want to beat up on the American president

2094
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:31,043
with a foreigner.

2095
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:32,580
I just don't, maybe I'm old fashioned.

2096
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:33,420
So, that's how I feel.

2097
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,710
So I didn't push it,

2098
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:36,405
but I thought it was really interesting.

2099
01:20:36,405 --> 01:20:39,900
And 'cause of course Putin knows my views on Joe Biden.

2100
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,350
He knew I applied to the CIA,

2101
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:44,610
so they've done some digging on me.

2102
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,650
but he didn't mention it and he didn't attack NATO.

2103
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:48,930
And the reason is I know for a fact

2104
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:50,640
'cause he wants a settlement.

2105
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,780
And he wants a settlement

2106
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,580
not because Russia's about to collapse

2107
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:54,690
despite the lying of our media.

2108
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:55,980
That's just not true.

2109
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,980
And no one is even saying it anymore 'cause it's so dumb.

2110
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:01,077
He wants it 'cause it's just bad to have a war.

2111
01:21:01,077 --> 01:21:02,490
And it changes the world

2112
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:04,800
in ways you can't predict, people die.

2113
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,210
Everything about it is sad.

2114
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:08,700
And if you can avoid it, you should.

2115
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,060
So I would like to see a settlement where,

2116
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,640
look, the thing that Russia wants

2117
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,080
and I think probably has a right to,

2118
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,540
is not to have NATO missiles on this border.

2119
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:20,398
Like, I don't know why we would do that.

2120
01:21:20,398 --> 01:21:21,653
I dunno what we get out of it.

2121
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,660
I just don't even understand it.

2122
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,400
I don't understand the purpose of NATO.

2123
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,140
I don't think NATO is good for the United States.

2124
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,570
I think it's an attack on our sovereignty.

2125
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:32,070
I would pull out of NATO immediately

2126
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,300
if I were the US president

2127
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,520
because I don't think it helps the US.

2128
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:36,660
I know a lot of people

2129
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:38,710
are getting their bread buttered by NATO,

2130
01:21:39,593 --> 01:21:42,670
but anyway that's my view as an American.

2131
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:44,599
If I'm a Russian or a Ukrainian,

2132
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:47,452
let's just be sovereign countries now.

2133
01:21:47,452 --> 01:21:49,230
We're not run by the US State Department,

2134
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:50,650
we're just our own countries.

2135
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,230
Like that's, I believe in sovereignty, okay?

2136
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:53,063
So, that's my view.

2137
01:21:53,063 --> 01:21:56,370
And I also wanna say one thing about Zelensky.

2138
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,550
I attacked him before because I was so offended

2139
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:03,270
by his cavalier talk about nuclear exchange

2140
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:05,730
because it would kill my family,

2141
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:06,630
so I'm really offended by that.

2142
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,150
Anyone who talks that way, I'm offended by.

2143
01:22:09,150 --> 01:22:11,280
But I do feel for Zelensky, I do.

2144
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:14,010
That he didn't run for president to have this happen.

2145
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:17,220
I think Zelensky, he's been completely misused

2146
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,010
by the State department, by Toria Nuland,

2147
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:22,080
by our secretary of state,

2148
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:25,080
by the policymakers in the US who've used Ukraine

2149
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,540
as a vessel for their ambitions,

2150
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,620
their geopolitical ambitions.

2151
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:32,460
But also the many American businesses who've used Ukraine

2152
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:35,040
as a way to fleece the American taxpayer.

2153
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,740
And then by just independent ghouls like Boris Johnson

2154
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,942
are hoping to get rich from interviews on it.

2155
01:22:39,942 --> 01:22:41,220
Like the whole thing, Zelensky is at the center of this.

2156
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,650
He's not driving history.

2157
01:22:43,650 --> 01:22:45,870
NATO in the United States is driving history.

2158
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:46,950
Putin is driving history.

2159
01:22:46,950 --> 01:22:48,180
There's this guy Zelensky.

2160
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:53,180
So, I do feel for him and I think he's in a perilous place.

2161
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:57,030
- Do you think Zelensky is a hero for staying in Kyiv?

2162
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:58,380
Because I do.

2163
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,990
To me, you can criticize a lot of things.

2164
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:04,800
You should call out things that are obviously positive.

2165
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,840
- Well, I just tried to a second ago.

2166
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,550
I don't know the extent that he is in Kyiv.

2167
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,420
He seems to be in the United States an awful lot.

2168
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,335
Like way too much.

2169
01:23:14,335 --> 01:23:15,168
You can do a satellite interview.

2170
01:23:15,168 --> 01:23:16,650
You don't have to speak to my Congress,

2171
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:18,300
you're not an American, please leave.

2172
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,003
- [Lex] Yeah. - That's my opinion.

2173
01:23:20,967 --> 01:23:23,140
- You got many zingers, Tucker.

2174
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:24,000
- No, no, no, it's just heartfelt.

2175
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,440
It's just bubbling up from the wellspring

2176
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:26,910
that never turns off.

2177
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:29,549
But I would say this about Zelensky.

2178
01:23:29,549 --> 01:23:32,610
Yeah, to the extent he's in Ukraine, good man.

2179
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,800
George W. Bush fled Washington on 9/11.

2180
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,690
I lived there with three kids and he ran away

2181
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:38,700
to some Air force base in South Dakota.

2182
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:39,690
And I thought that was cowardly,

2183
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:41,193
and I said so at the time.

2184
01:23:42,057 --> 01:23:43,497
And man was I attacked for saying that.

2185
01:23:43,497 --> 01:23:45,390
And I wrote a column about it in, New York Magazine

2186
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:46,470
where I then had a column.

2187
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:47,303
Hard to believe.

2188
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:50,580
But I felt that, I felt that.

2189
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:53,160
I think the prerequisites of leadership are really basic.

2190
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,260
The first is caring about the people you lead.

2191
01:23:55,260 --> 01:23:56,914
That's number one.

2192
01:23:56,914 --> 01:23:59,250
A deep, in the way a father cares for his children

2193
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:00,750
or an officer cares for his troops,

2194
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,340
a president should care for his people.

2195
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:05,640
And that leads inexorably to the next requirement,

2196
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,390
which is bravery, physical courage.

2197
01:24:08,361 --> 01:24:09,720
And I believe in that.

2198
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,770
And I'm not like some tough guy,

2199
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:11,700
but I just think it's obvious.

2200
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,244
If you're in charge.

2201
01:24:13,244 --> 01:24:15,480
I'm at my house and I feel like someone broke in,

2202
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:16,590
I'm not gonna say to my wife, "Hey, baby,

2203
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:19,590
go deal with the home invasion."

2204
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:21,300
I'm gonna deal with it 'cause I'm dad, okay?

2205
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,217
So if you're the president of a country

2206
01:24:23,217 --> 01:24:25,020
and your capital city is attacked

2207
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,530
as ours was at the Pentagon and you run away.

2208
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,020
And the Secret Service told me to.

2209
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:32,472
Bitch, are you in charge?

2210
01:24:32,472 --> 01:24:33,305
(Lex chuckling)

2211
01:24:33,305 --> 01:24:34,200
Like, who's daddy here?

2212
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,790
The Secret Service.

2213
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:37,122
Do you know what I mean?

2214
01:24:37,122 --> 01:24:39,333
I found that totally contemptible.

2215
01:24:40,256 --> 01:24:41,700
And I said so, and man, did I get a lecture.

2216
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:43,860
Not just from Republicans but from Democrats.

2217
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:46,203
Oh you don't know, put yourself in that position.

2218
01:24:46,203 --> 01:24:49,680
I was like, "Okay, I don't know what I would do

2219
01:24:49,680 --> 01:24:51,870
under that kind of stress."

2220
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,010
Enormous stress, I get it.

2221
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:55,380
I know one thing I wouldn't do is run away,

2222
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,000
'cause you can't do that.

2223
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,280
And if you're not willing to die for your country,

2224
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,330
then you shouldn't be leading it.

2225
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:02,850
So yes, to the extent if Zelensky

2226
01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:05,820
really is in Ukraine most of the time, amen.

2227
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,560
- Well, hold on a second, let's clarify.

2228
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:09,460
It's not about what is in Ukraine most of the time or not.

2229
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,950
- Well, I thought that was the whole premise

2230
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,367
of the- (laughs) - No, no,

2231
01:25:12,367 --> 01:25:16,020
at the beginning of the war, when the tank,

2232
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,596
when Kyiv, when a lot of people thought

2233
01:25:18,596 --> 01:25:22,380
that the second biggest military in the world

2234
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:26,550
is pointing its guns in Kyiv is gonna be taken.

2235
01:25:26,550 --> 01:25:29,910
And a man, a leader who stays in that city

2236
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:33,450
and says, fuck it, when everybody around him says flee,

2237
01:25:33,450 --> 01:25:35,790
says everybody around him believes the city

2238
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:38,190
will be taken or at least destroyed.

2239
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:41,280
Leveled, artillery, bombs, all of this.

2240
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:42,810
He chooses to stay.

2241
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,340
You know a lot of leaders,

2242
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:46,470
how many leaders would choose to stay?

2243
01:25:46,470 --> 01:25:49,440
- Well, the leader of Afghanistan, the US backed leader,

2244
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,110
when the Taliban came, got in a US plane

2245
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:54,360
with US dollars and ran away.

2246
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,390
And of course is living on those dollars now.

2247
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:58,890
So yeah, there's a lot of cowardly behavior.

2248
01:25:58,890 --> 01:25:59,723
Good for him.

2249
01:25:59,723 --> 01:26:02,583
I mean, I guess I'm looking at it slightly differently,

2250
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:05,730
which is what's the option?

2251
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:07,770
You're the leader of the country, you can't leave.

2252
01:26:07,770 --> 01:26:09,900
Like Stalin never left Moscow during the war.

2253
01:26:09,900 --> 01:26:13,050
It was surrounded by the Germans, as you know, for a year.

2254
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:14,160
And he didn't leave.

2255
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:16,807
And when I was in Russia, they're like, Stalin never left.

2256
01:26:16,807 --> 01:26:18,743
It's like how he's the leader of the country.

2257
01:26:18,743 --> 01:26:21,600
You can't, I mean like that's just table stakes of course.

2258
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,310
I would say, but you raised

2259
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,080
an interesting by implication question,

2260
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:28,413
which is what about Kyiv?

2261
01:26:28,413 --> 01:26:30,450
Like you think the Russians couldn't level Kyiv?

2262
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:33,750
Of course, obviously they could, why haven't they?

2263
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,970
They could, but they haven't.

2264
01:26:35,970 --> 01:26:39,330
- Well, there's military answers to that,

2265
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,940
which is urban warfare is extremely difficult.

2266
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:45,030
- Do you think that Putin wants to take Kyiv?

2267
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:48,112
- No, I do think he expected Zelensky to flee

2268
01:26:48,112 --> 01:26:50,220
and somebody else to come into power.

2269
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:52,933
- Yeah, that may be totally, I don't know.

2270
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:55,878
I don't think, I have no idea what Putin was thinking

2271
01:26:55,878 --> 01:27:00,103
when he did that about Zelensky.

2272
01:27:00,103 --> 01:27:01,350
I didn't ask him.

2273
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:04,620
But it's a mistake to imagine this is a contest

2274
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:06,630
between Putin and Zelensky.

2275
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:09,000
This is Putin versus the US State Department.

2276
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:10,830
I mean Zelensky, and that's why I said

2277
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:12,600
I felt sorry for him.

2278
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,320
I mean, as I said, we're literally paying the pensions

2279
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,460
of Ukrainian bureaucrats.

2280
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,990
So there is no Ukrainian government

2281
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:20,370
independent of the US government.

2282
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:23,490
And maybe therefore that maybe you're against it,

2283
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:26,160
but you can't endorse that in the same sentence

2284
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,510
that you use the term democracy,

2285
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:29,580
'cause that's not a democracy, right? Obviously.

2286
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,690
- Well, that's why it's interesting

2287
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:33,750
that he didn't really bring up NATO extensively.

2288
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,187
- He wants a settlement, he wants a settlement

2289
01:27:35,187 --> 01:27:38,670
and he doesn't wanna fight with them rhetorically.

2290
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,110
And he just wants to get this done.

2291
01:27:40,110 --> 01:27:43,920
And he made a bunch of offers at the peace deal.

2292
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,770
And we wouldn't even know this happened

2293
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,717
if the Israelis hadn't told us.

2294
01:27:48,717 --> 01:27:50,678
And I'm so grateful that they did

2295
01:27:50,678 --> 01:27:52,620
that Johnson was dispatched

2296
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,120
by the State Department to stop it.

2297
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,560
And it's like, I mean I think Boris Johnson

2298
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:00,630
is a husk of a man.

2299
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:02,340
But imagine if you were Boris Johnson

2300
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,740
and you spend your whole life with Ukraine flag pen,

2301
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:07,650
I'm for Ukraine, and then all those kids died

2302
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,172
because of what you did.

2303
01:28:09,172 --> 01:28:11,040
And the lines haven't really moved.

2304
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,928
It hasn't been a victory for Ukraine.

2305
01:28:12,928 --> 01:28:14,310
It's not gonna be a victory for Ukraine.

2306
01:28:14,310 --> 01:28:16,560
And it's like, how do you feel about yourself

2307
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,393
if you did that?

2308
01:28:17,393 --> 01:28:18,990
I mean I've done a lot of shitty things in my life.

2309
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:20,353
I feel bad about them,

2310
01:28:20,353 --> 01:28:22,860
but I've never extended a war for no reason.

2311
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,413
Like that's a pretty grave sin in my opinion.

2312
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:29,670
- Yes, that was a failure.

2313
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,370
But it doesn't mean you can't have a success over and over

2314
01:28:32,370 --> 01:28:36,510
and over keep having negotiations between leaders.

2315
01:28:36,510 --> 01:28:39,450
- Well, the US government is not allowing negotiations.

2316
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:41,910
And so, that for me is the most upsetting part.

2317
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:44,400
It's like in the end what Russia does

2318
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,050
I'm not implicated in that.

2319
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:47,850
What Ukraine does, I'm not implicated in that.

2320
01:28:47,850 --> 01:28:49,110
I'm not Russian or Ukraine.

2321
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:51,510
I'm an American who grew up really believing in my country.

2322
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:54,660
I'm supporting my country through my tax dollars.

2323
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,490
And it's like I really care about

2324
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:57,420
what the US government does

2325
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:58,680
'cause they're doing it in my name

2326
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:00,445
and I care a lot 'cause I'm American

2327
01:29:00,445 --> 01:29:04,860
and we are the impediment to peace,

2328
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:06,720
which is another way of saying we are responsible

2329
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,010
for all these innocent people

2330
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:09,670
getting dragooned outta public parks in Kyiv

2331
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:11,670
and sent to go die.

2332
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:12,573
Like what?

2333
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:15,090
That is not good.

2334
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:16,110
I'm ashamed of it.

2335
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:18,810
- What do you think of Putin saying that justification

2336
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:21,510
for continuing the war is denazification?

2337
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,460
- I thought it was one of the dumbest things I'd ever heard.

2338
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:26,670
I didn't understand what it meant, denazification.

2339
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:30,360
- It literally means what it sounds like.

2340
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,490
- Yeah, I mean I have a lot of thoughts on this.

2341
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:35,790
I hate that whole conversation because it's not real,

2342
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,630
it's just ad hominem.

2343
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:39,570
It's a way of associating someone with an evil regime

2344
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:40,920
that doesn't exist anymore.

2345
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:45,750
But in point of fact, Nazism, whatever it was,

2346
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:48,450
is inseparable from the German nation.

2347
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:50,340
It was a nationalist movement in Germany.

2348
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,410
There were no other Nazis, right?

2349
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:53,960
There's no book of Nazism.

2350
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:54,900
I'm like, I wanna be a Nazi.

2351
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:55,860
What does it mean to be a Nazi?

2352
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,421
There's no idea, there's no...

2353
01:29:57,421 --> 01:29:58,254
I mean there's no, "Mein Kampf,"

2354
01:29:58,254 --> 01:30:00,487
is not, "Das Kapital," right?

2355
01:30:00,487 --> 01:30:03,397
"Mein Kampf," is like, to the extent I understand it,

2356
01:30:03,397 --> 01:30:04,710
it's like he's about the Treaty of Versailles.

2357
01:30:04,710 --> 01:30:06,780
Whatever, I'm very anti-Nazi.

2358
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:10,743
I'm merely saying there isn't a Nazi movement in 2024.

2359
01:30:12,139 --> 01:30:13,590
It's a way of calling people evil.

2360
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:18,540
Okay, Putin doesn't like nationalist Ukrainians.

2361
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,725
Putin hates nationalism in general, which is interesting.

2362
01:30:21,725 --> 01:30:22,560
And of course he does.

2363
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,156
He's got 80 whatever republics

2364
01:30:25,156 --> 01:30:27,060
and he's afraid of nationalist movements.

2365
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,040
He fought a war in Chechnya over this.

2366
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,020
So I understand it, but I have a different,

2367
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:33,180
I'm for national, I'm for American nationalism,

2368
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,830
so like I disagree with Putin on that,

2369
01:30:34,830 --> 01:30:36,900
but calling them Nazis, it's like,

2370
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:38,250
I thought it was childish.

2371
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,863
- Well, I do believe that he believes it.

2372
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:42,900
- I agree with that.

2373
01:30:42,900 --> 01:30:44,670
'Cause I was listening to this

2374
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:46,110
because in the United States everyone's

2375
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:47,460
always calling everyone else a Nazi.

2376
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:48,300
You're a Nazi.

2377
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,133
Okay.

2378
01:30:50,580 --> 01:30:52,177
But I was listening to this and I was like,

2379
01:30:52,177 --> 01:30:56,460
"This is the dumbest sort of not convincing line

2380
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:57,330
you could take."

2381
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,470
And I sat there and listened to him

2382
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:00,270
talk about Nazis for like eight minutes.

2383
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:02,640
And I'm like, "I think he believes this."

2384
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:06,030
- Yeah, and I actually having had a bunch of conversations

2385
01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:09,780
with people who are living in Russia, they also believe it.

2386
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:14,040
Now there's technicalities here, which the word Nazi,

2387
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,050
the World War II is deeply in the blood

2388
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:17,250
of a lot of Russians and Ukrainians.

2389
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:18,083
- [Tucker] I get it, I get it.

2390
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,760
- So you're using it as almost a political term,

2391
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,800
the way it's used in the United States also,

2392
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,750
like racism and all this kind of stuff.

2393
01:31:26,654 --> 01:31:29,459
So, you can really touch people if you use the Nazi.

2394
01:31:29,459 --> 01:31:30,300
- [Tucker] I think that's totally right.

2395
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:35,300
- But it's also to me a really like disgusting thing to do.

2396
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,173
- [Tucker] I agree.

2397
01:31:36,173 --> 01:31:37,980
- Because, and also to clarify,

2398
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:41,317
there is neo-Nazi movements in Ukraine,

2399
01:31:41,317 --> 01:31:43,050
which is, they're very small.

2400
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:44,430
You're saying that there's this distinction

2401
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:47,220
between Nazi and neo-Nazi, sure.

2402
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:50,460
But it's a small percentage of the population,

2403
01:31:50,460 --> 01:31:53,130
a tiny percentage that have no power in government

2404
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:55,680
as far I have seen no data to show

2405
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:58,740
they have any influence on Zelensky

2406
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:02,310
and Zelensky government at all.

2407
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:05,010
So really, when Putin says denazification,

2408
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:08,520
I think he means nationalist movements.

2409
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,507
- I think you're right.

2410
01:32:09,507 --> 01:32:11,490
And I agree with everything you said,

2411
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,340
and I do think that the war,

2412
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:18,600
the Second World War occupies a place in Slavic society,

2413
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,810
Polish society, central Eastern Europe

2414
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:23,310
that it does not occupy in the United States.

2415
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:26,580
And you can just look at the death totals.

2416
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:28,920
Tens of millions versus less than half a million.

2417
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:31,110
So it's like this eliminated

2418
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:32,850
a lot of the male population of these countries,

2419
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:37,446
so of course it's still resonant in those countries.

2420
01:32:37,446 --> 01:32:38,640
I get it.

2421
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:41,490
I just, I think I've watched,

2422
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:46,440
I don't think I know I've watched the misuse of words,

2423
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,270
weaponization of words for political reasons

2424
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:50,820
for so long that I just don't like,

2425
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:53,850
and though I do engage in it sometime, I'm sorry,

2426
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:57,346
I don't like just dismissing people in a word.

2427
01:32:57,346 --> 01:32:58,833
Oh, he's a Nazi, he's a liberal or whatever.

2428
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:00,540
It's like, tell me what you mean,

2429
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:03,840
what don't you like about what they're doing or saying?

2430
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,147
And a Nazi especially, it's like,

2431
01:33:06,147 --> 01:33:07,560
I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.

2432
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,170
- What troubled me about that is because he said

2433
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:13,110
that that's the primary objective currently for the war.

2434
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:18,110
And that because it's not grounded in reality,

2435
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:20,550
it makes it difficult to then negotiate peace

2436
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:24,330
because like what, what does it mean to get rid

2437
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:25,770
of the Nazis in Ukraine?

2438
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:28,207
So like he'll come to the table and say,

2439
01:33:28,207 --> 01:33:31,236
"Well, okay, I will agree to do ceasefire

2440
01:33:31,236 --> 01:33:33,060
once the Nazis are gone."

2441
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,650
Okay, so can you list the Nazis?

2442
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:35,979
- I totally agree.

2443
01:33:35,979 --> 01:33:36,812
Plus can you negotiate with a Nazi?

2444
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:38,050
- [Lex] Right, exactly, exactly.

2445
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:39,590
- No, I totally agree with you.

2446
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:41,371
- It was very strange.

2447
01:33:41,371 --> 01:33:42,690
But maybe it was perhaps had to do

2448
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:45,205
with speaking to his own population

2449
01:33:45,205 --> 01:33:49,630
and also probably trying to avoid the use of the word NATO

2450
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,410
as the justification for the war.

2451
01:33:52,410 --> 01:33:54,050
- Yeah, yes, that's all...

2452
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:55,300
Of course, I don't know,

2453
01:33:55,300 --> 01:33:57,330
but I suspect you're right on both counts.

2454
01:33:57,330 --> 01:33:59,913
But I would say it points to something

2455
01:33:59,913 --> 01:34:02,460
that I've thought more and more since I did that interview,

2456
01:34:02,460 --> 01:34:04,360
which was like two weeks ago, I guess.

2457
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:07,680
I didn't think he was like,

2458
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,330
as a PR guy, not very good.

2459
01:34:09,330 --> 01:34:11,530
Like he's not good at telling his own story.

2460
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:15,120
The story of the current war in Ukraine

2461
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:17,580
is the eastward expansion of NATO

2462
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:20,520
and scaring the outta the Russians with NATO expansion,

2463
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:21,353
which is totally necessary.

2464
01:34:21,353 --> 01:34:22,620
Doesn't help the United States.

2465
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:24,840
NATO itself doesn't help the United States.

2466
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,940
And so I'm not pro-Russian for saying

2467
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:28,170
that I'm pro-American for saying that.

2468
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,730
And I think that's a really compelling story,

2469
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:30,580
'cause it's true.

2470
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,970
He did not tell that story.

2471
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,607
He told some other story that I didn't fully understand.

2472
01:34:34,607 --> 01:34:36,060
Again, I'm not Russian.

2473
01:34:36,060 --> 01:34:38,940
He's speaking to multiple audiences around the world.

2474
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:42,270
I'm not sure what he hoped to achieve by that interview.

2475
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:43,800
I will never know.

2476
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,690
But I did think that like this guy

2477
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:47,250
is not good at telling his story.

2478
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:50,433
And I also think honestly on the base of a lot,

2479
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:54,693
I mean I know this, very isolated during COVID, very.

2480
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:59,580
We keep hearing that he's dying of this or that disease.

2481
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:00,413
He's got ALS.

2482
01:35:00,413 --> 01:35:02,160
I mean I don't know, I'm not his doctor.

2483
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,750
There's a ton of lying about it.

2484
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:04,650
I know that.

2485
01:35:04,650 --> 01:35:05,790
But one thing that's not a lie

2486
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:09,780
is that he was cloistered away during COVID.

2487
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:11,310
I know this.

2488
01:35:11,310 --> 01:35:14,190
And only dealing with two or three people.

2489
01:35:14,190 --> 01:35:15,720
And that makes you weird.

2490
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:18,090
It's so important to deal with a lot of people

2491
01:35:18,090 --> 01:35:19,830
to have your views challenged.

2492
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:22,320
And you see this with leaders who stay in power too long.

2493
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,663
He's been in power 24 years, effectively.

2494
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:28,380
He's done a, you know, there's been upsides

2495
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:30,210
I think for Russia, the Russian economy,

2496
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:31,140
Russian life expectancy.

2497
01:35:31,140 --> 01:35:32,850
But there are definitely downsides.

2498
01:35:32,850 --> 01:35:37,413
And one of them is you get weird and you get autocratic.

2499
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,110
Like this is why we have term limits.

2500
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:42,753
Very few kings don't get crazy in old age.

2501
01:35:44,130 --> 01:35:47,070
- Yeah, and you said some of this also in your,

2502
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:50,700
whilst in your post Kremlin discussion

2503
01:35:50,700 --> 01:35:52,260
while you're in Moscow still,

2504
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:53,640
which was very impressive to me

2505
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:55,980
that you can just openly criticize.

2506
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,226
This is great.

2507
01:35:57,226 --> 01:35:58,059
- Well, I don't care.

2508
01:35:58,059 --> 01:35:58,892
- I understand this.

2509
01:35:58,892 --> 01:36:00,420
I just wish you did some more of that

2510
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:02,622
also with the supermarket video

2511
01:36:02,622 --> 01:36:05,472
and perhaps some more of that with Putin in front of you.

2512
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:08,477
- Putin in front of me. - [Lex] I understand.

2513
01:36:08,477 --> 01:36:10,080
- I'm such a good person.

2514
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,270
- I know you see it as virtue signaling.

2515
01:36:12,270 --> 01:36:13,680
- Yeah, it is.

2516
01:36:13,680 --> 01:36:15,210
- Have you seen some of the interview

2517
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:17,703
he did with some NBC news child?

2518
01:36:17,703 --> 01:36:18,536
- Yes, I understand.

2519
01:36:18,536 --> 01:36:23,163
So I think you're just so annoyed by how bad journalists are

2520
01:36:23,163 --> 01:36:25,320
that you just didn't want to be them.

2521
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:29,242
- Yeah, that's probably right actually. (laughs)

2522
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,830
- Some great conversations will involve some challenging,

2523
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:34,140
like you were confused about denazification.

2524
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,510
- Well first of all, I accept your criticism

2525
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:40,740
and I accept it as true that in some way

2526
01:36:40,740 --> 01:36:43,983
I'm probably pivoting against what I dislike.

2527
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,520
And I have such contempt for American journalists

2528
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,750
on the basis of so much knowledge

2529
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:52,290
that I probably was like, I don't wanna be like that, fair.

2530
01:36:52,290 --> 01:36:54,780
That is a kind of defensiveness and dumb.

2531
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:56,403
So, you're right.

2532
01:36:57,306 --> 01:37:00,060
As for the Nazi thing, I was like,

2533
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,550
I really felt like we were just speaking

2534
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:06,111
so far past each other that we would never like come to,

2535
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:06,944
I was like, I don't even know

2536
01:37:06,944 --> 01:37:08,230
what the hell you're talking about.

2537
01:37:09,621 --> 01:37:11,340
And especially when I decided

2538
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,920
or concluded that he really meant it, I was like,

2539
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,140
that's just too freaking weird to me.

2540
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:19,710
It's almost like, yeah, I can think of many other examples.

2541
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:20,670
We were interviewing someone else,

2542
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:24,060
say something that's like, I was interviewing a guy one time

2543
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:28,530
and he started talking about the black Israelites,

2544
01:37:28,530 --> 01:37:29,670
and we're the real Jews.

2545
01:37:29,670 --> 01:37:32,280
And I was like, and it wasn't on camera,

2546
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,950
but I was like, I don't, that was so,

2547
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:36,870
it was so far out to me that I was like,

2548
01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:41,870
we'll never kind of understand common terms on that.

2549
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:45,000
- So you mentioned there's a bunch of conspiracy theories

2550
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,070
about Putin's health.

2551
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:48,150
How was he in person?

2552
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:49,037
Like what did he feel like?

2553
01:37:49,037 --> 01:37:50,433
Did he look healthy?

2554
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:55,003
- I'm not a health person myself, so I mean,

2555
01:37:55,003 --> 01:37:57,390
I can easily gain 30 pounds and not know it.

2556
01:37:57,390 --> 01:37:59,760
So like, I'm probably not a great person to ask.

2557
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,780
But no, he seemed fine.

2558
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:05,130
He seemed, he had his arm hooked through a chair

2559
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:07,680
and I heard people say, well, he's got Parkinson's.

2560
01:38:09,108 --> 01:38:10,290
And Parkinson's can be controlled,

2561
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:12,663
I know for periods with drugs.

2562
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:15,240
So, it's hard to assess.

2563
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,620
I'm just not...

2564
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:18,960
One of the tells of Parkinson's is gait.

2565
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:21,330
How a person walks, I think.

2566
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:22,290
And his walking seemed fine.

2567
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:24,990
I walked around with him and talked to him off camera.

2568
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,833
He's had some work done for sure.

2569
01:38:28,833 --> 01:38:30,758
He's 71 or two.

2570
01:38:30,758 --> 01:38:32,190
- [Lex] You mean like visual purposes?

2571
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,300
- Yeah, I'm 54.

2572
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,440
He's like almost 20 years older than me.

2573
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,610
He looked younger than me.

2574
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,980
- What was that like, the conversation off camera,

2575
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:39,633
like you walking around with him.

2576
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,900
What was the content of the conversation?

2577
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:45,270
- I mean, I can't, you know, I feel bad even with Putin

2578
01:38:45,270 --> 01:38:48,303
or anybody like talking about stuff that is off the record.

2579
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:53,597
But I'll just say that when I said that

2580
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:56,730
he didn't wanna fight with NATO

2581
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,640
or with the US State Department or with Joe Biden

2582
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,140
because he wants a settlement,

2583
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:06,663
that's a very informed perspective.

2584
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:08,633
He doesn't.

2585
01:39:09,650 --> 01:39:11,700
Say whatever you want about that,

2586
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:14,373
believe it or not, but that is true.

2587
01:39:16,889 --> 01:39:21,037
- So, he's open for peace. For peace and negotiation.

2588
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:27,180
Russia tried to join NATO in 2000.

2589
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:28,170
That's a fact.

2590
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,580
Okay, they tried to join NATO

2591
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:30,600
So just think about this,

2592
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:34,050
NATO exists to keep Russia contained.

2593
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:35,070
It exists as a bulwark

2594
01:39:35,070 --> 01:39:37,773
against Russian territorial expansion.

2595
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,530
And whether or not Russia

2596
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:44,040
has any territorial ambitions is another question.

2597
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,840
Like why would it, it's the largest land mass

2598
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,310
in the world, whatever.

2599
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:48,630
But that's why it exists.

2600
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:51,840
So if Russia seeks to join NATO,

2601
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,890
it is by definition a sign that NATO's job is done here

2602
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:58,143
we can declare victory and go home.

2603
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,380
The fact that they turned him down

2604
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:02,910
is like so shocking to me.

2605
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:03,780
But it's true.

2606
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:05,910
Then he approaches the next president,

2607
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:07,320
George W. Bush, that was with Bill Clinton

2608
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,060
at the end of his term in 2000.

2609
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:10,320
He approaches the next president and said,

2610
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,450
let's, in our next missile deal,

2611
01:40:12,450 --> 01:40:16,440
let's align on this and we will designate Iran

2612
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,717
as our common enemy.

2613
01:40:17,717 --> 01:40:20,640
Iran which is now effectively league with Russia,

2614
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:24,633
thanks to our insane policies.

2615
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:29,775
And George W. Bush to his credit's like,

2616
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:32,366
well, that seems like kind of an innovative good idea.

2617
01:40:32,366 --> 01:40:34,170
And Condi Rice, who's like one of the stupidest people ever

2618
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:36,270
to hold power in the United States, if I can say,

2619
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:38,340
who's like monomaniacally anti-Russia versus,

2620
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:39,780
'cause she had an advisor at Stanford

2621
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,820
who was or something during the Cold War.

2622
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,960
No, we can't do that.

2623
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,670
And Bush is just weak, and so he agreed.

2624
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:46,380
It's like, what?

2625
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,690
That is crazy.

2626
01:40:48,690 --> 01:40:51,780
If you're fighting with someone and the person says,

2627
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:54,060
you know what, actually our interests align

2628
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,700
and you've spent 80% of your mental disc space

2629
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:58,500
on hating me and opposing me or whatever,

2630
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:01,320
but actually we can be on the same team.

2631
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,980
If you don't at least see that as progress.

2632
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:06,360
Like what, why would you...

2633
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:10,050
If your interest is in helping your country,

2634
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:13,380
what would be the, what's the counterargument?

2635
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:15,186
I don't even understand it.

2636
01:41:15,186 --> 01:41:17,490
And no one has even addressed any of this.

2637
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:19,260
The war of Russian aggression.

2638
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,600
Yeah, it was a war of Russian aggression for sure.

2639
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,330
But how did we get there?

2640
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:27,420
We got there because Joe Biden

2641
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,580
and Tony Blinken dispatched Kamala Harris,

2642
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,620
who does not freelance this stuff, okay?

2643
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:32,760
Fair to say.

2644
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:34,830
To the Munich Security Conference

2645
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:38,790
two years ago this month, February, 2022,

2646
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:41,170
and said, in a press conference to Zelensky,

2647
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:43,710
poor Zelensky, we want you to join NATO.

2648
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:44,910
This was not in a back room.

2649
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:48,420
Things was in public at a press conference knowing,

2650
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,580
because he said it like 4,000 times,

2651
01:41:50,580 --> 01:41:54,540
we don't want nuclear weapons from the United States

2652
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:58,500
or NATO on our Western border.

2653
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:03,090
Duh. And days later he invaded.

2654
01:42:03,090 --> 01:42:05,995
So like, what is that?

2655
01:42:05,995 --> 01:42:09,360
And if you even, I raised that question in my previous job,

2656
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:11,243
and I was denounced as you,

2657
01:42:11,243 --> 01:42:12,360
of course a traitor or something.

2658
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,680
But okay, great, I'm a traitor.

2659
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,600
What's the answer?

2660
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,920
What's the answer?

2661
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,300
These are not into...

2662
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:20,968
Toria Nuland who I know, not dumb,

2663
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,920
hasn't helped the US in any way.

2664
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:25,830
An architect of the Iraq war, architect of this disaster,

2665
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:27,270
one of the people who destroyed the US dollar,

2666
01:42:27,270 --> 01:42:29,400
okay, fine, but you're not stupid.

2667
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:33,450
So, like you're trying to get a war by acting that way.

2668
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:35,730
What's the other explanation.

2669
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:37,980
By the way, NATO didn't want Ukraine

2670
01:42:37,980 --> 01:42:40,380
'cause it didn't meet the criteria.

2671
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,180
So, for admission.

2672
01:42:42,180 --> 01:42:43,440
So, why would you say that?

2673
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:46,080
Because you want a war. That's why.

2674
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:48,930
And that war has enriched a lot of people

2675
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:50,760
to the tune of billions.

2676
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,250
So I don't care if I sound like some kind

2677
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:55,020
of left-wing conspiracy nut

2678
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,050
because I'm neither left-wing nor a conspiracy nut.

2679
01:42:58,050 --> 01:42:59,460
Tell me how I'm wrong.

2680
01:42:59,460 --> 01:43:00,960
- Who do you think is behind it?

2681
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,570
If you are to analyze, like zoom out

2682
01:43:03,570 --> 01:43:06,240
looking at the entirety of human history,

2683
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:10,290
the military industrial complex, you said Kamala Harris.

2684
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:11,940
Is it individuals?

2685
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:14,880
Is it like this collective flock

2686
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,580
that people are just pro-war as a collective?

2687
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:18,903
- It's the hive mind.

2688
01:43:20,129 --> 01:43:22,260
And I spent my whole life in DC

2689
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:24,930
from '85 to 2020, so 35 years.

2690
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:28,200
And again, I grew up around it in that world.

2691
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:32,370
And I do think that conspiracies,

2692
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,230
of course there are conspiracies.

2693
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:35,850
But in general, the hive mind

2694
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,590
is responsible for the worst decisions.

2695
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:40,923
It's a bunch of people with the same views, totally.

2696
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:43,990
Views that have not been updated in decades.

2697
01:43:44,856 --> 01:43:48,180
Putin said something that I thought was true.

2698
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:49,013
Absolutely true.

2699
01:43:49,013 --> 01:43:50,460
I don't know how he would know this, but it is true,

2700
01:43:50,460 --> 01:43:52,350
'cause I lived among them.

2701
01:43:52,350 --> 01:43:55,600
So the Soviet Union dissolves in August of '91

2702
01:43:56,700 --> 01:43:57,990
on my honeymoon in Bermuda.

2703
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:58,860
I'll never forget it.

2704
01:43:58,860 --> 01:44:01,587
And it was a big thing, if you lived in DC,

2705
01:44:01,587 --> 01:44:05,850
I mean, the receptionist in my office in 1991

2706
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:08,190
was getting a master's in Russian from Georgetown.

2707
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:10,320
He was gonna be a sovietologists.

2708
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,510
And he was among thousands of people in Washington

2709
01:44:12,510 --> 01:44:13,920
on that same track.

2710
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,690
And so the Soviet Union collapses.

2711
01:44:15,690 --> 01:44:18,480
Well, so does the rationale for like a good portion

2712
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:23,280
of the US government has been dedicated for over 40 years

2713
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,290
to opposing this thing that no longer exists.

2714
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:26,820
So, there's a lot of forward momentum.

2715
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:27,960
There's a huge amount of money.

2716
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:30,540
The bulk of the money in the richest country in the world

2717
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:31,470
aimed in this direction.

2718
01:44:31,470 --> 01:44:36,470
And it's very hard for people to readjust, to reassess.

2719
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:38,733
And you see this in life all the time.

2720
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:41,670
I love my wife.

2721
01:44:41,670 --> 01:44:43,800
All of a sudden she ran off with my best friend.

2722
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:45,540
Holy shit, I didn't expect that this morning.

2723
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:46,410
Now, it's a reality.

2724
01:44:46,410 --> 01:44:47,340
Like how do I deal with that?

2725
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:51,687
Well, I got stage four cancer diagnosis, okay?

2726
01:44:51,687 --> 01:44:52,830
And it's all bad.

2727
01:44:52,830 --> 01:44:55,410
But I'm just saying like, that's the nature of life.

2728
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:56,790
Things that you did not anticipate,

2729
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:00,000
never thought you'd have to face happen out of nowhere.

2730
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,960
And you have to adjust your expectations and your goals.

2731
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:05,490
And people have a hard time with that.

2732
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:06,540
Very hard time with that.

2733
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:09,300
So, that's a lot of it.

2734
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,750
People, if you're Condi Rice,

2735
01:45:11,790 --> 01:45:14,760
sort of like highly ambitious mid wit

2736
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,460
who gets this degree from Stanford,

2737
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:18,930
and you read Tolstoy in the original.

2738
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:19,763
Sure, you did.

2739
01:45:20,856 --> 01:45:22,530
And you spent your whole life like thinking

2740
01:45:22,530 --> 01:45:25,773
that Russia is the center of evil in the world.

2741
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:29,130
It's kind of hard to be like,

2742
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:31,290
well actually there's a new threat

2743
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:32,670
and it's coming from farther east.

2744
01:45:32,670 --> 01:45:34,370
It's primarily an economic threat.

2745
01:45:36,222 --> 01:45:38,550
And maybe all the threats aren't reduced to tank battles.

2746
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:40,560
That's the other thing, is these people

2747
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,860
are so inelastic in their thinking, so lacking imagination

2748
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:46,800
and flexibility that they can't sort

2749
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:49,590
of imagine like a new framework.

2750
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:51,780
And the new framework is not that you're gonna go to war

2751
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:55,500
with China over Formosa, Taiwan.

2752
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,450
No, the framework is that all of a sudden

2753
01:45:57,450 --> 01:46:00,180
all the infrastructure in Tijuana

2754
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:01,890
is gonna be built by China.

2755
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:03,780
And like that's a different kind of threat,

2756
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:06,150
but they can't kind of get there

2757
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:07,860
because they're not that impressive.

2758
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:09,694
- So you actually have mentioned this,

2759
01:46:09,694 --> 01:46:12,360
it's not just the Cold War, it's World War II

2760
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:16,740
that populates most of their thinking in Washington.

2761
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:21,120
You mentioned Churchill, Chamberlain and Hitler.

2762
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:23,507
And they kind of seeing the World War II

2763
01:46:23,507 --> 01:46:27,570
as the kind of the good war and the successful role

2764
01:46:27,570 --> 01:46:29,190
the United States played in that war,

2765
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:32,945
they're kind of seeing that dynamic,

2766
01:46:32,945 --> 01:46:36,330
that geopolitical dynamic

2767
01:46:36,330 --> 01:46:38,523
and applying it everywhere else still.

2768
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:42,330
- Yeah, it's a template for everything.

2769
01:46:42,330 --> 01:46:45,220
And I think it's of huge significance

2770
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:47,010
to the development of the West,

2771
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:48,750
to the civilization we live in now

2772
01:46:48,750 --> 01:46:52,530
to world history was a world war.

2773
01:46:52,530 --> 01:46:54,120
And so I think it's worth knowing a lot about

2774
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:56,670
and being honest about and all the rest,

2775
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:59,100
but it's hardly the sum total of human history.

2776
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,663
Yeah, it's a snapshot.

2777
01:47:02,662 --> 01:47:06,120
And so you keep hearing people refer to not even the war,

2778
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:08,010
no one ever talks about the war.

2779
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:10,320
Like what, how much does Tony Blinken

2780
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,610
know about the battle of Stalingrad?

2781
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:13,530
Hmm, probably zero.

2782
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:15,265
He doesn't know anything.

2783
01:47:15,265 --> 01:47:16,098
Largest battle in human history.

2784
01:47:16,098 --> 01:47:17,100
But everybody, he knows nothing.

2785
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:20,010
But he knows a lot about the cliches

2786
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:25,010
surrounding the '38 to '40 period, 1938 to 1940.

2787
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:29,893
And everything is kind of expressed through that formula

2788
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:33,000
and not everything is that formula.

2789
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,200
That's all I'm saying.

2790
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:38,010
And the Republicans have a strange weakness for it,

2791
01:47:38,010 --> 01:47:39,900
particularly the closeted ones,

2792
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:42,330
the weird ones who were like have no life

2793
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:45,415
other than like starting more wars.

2794
01:47:45,415 --> 01:47:49,470
Everything to them, the most vulnerable, I would say

2795
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:53,940
among them, emotionally, psychologically vulnerable,

2796
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:55,020
the dumbest,

2797
01:47:55,020 --> 01:47:57,663
they will always say the same thing.

2798
01:47:57,663 --> 01:47:59,610
And it appeals to Republican voters, unfortunately,

2799
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:01,620
that every problem is the result of weakness.

2800
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,770
Everyone's Chamberlain.

2801
01:48:04,206 --> 01:48:05,270
Like Germany never would've gone in

2802
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:08,880
to Poland, Czechoslovakia if England had been stronger.

2803
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:09,713
That's the argument.

2804
01:48:09,713 --> 01:48:10,546
Is that true?

2805
01:48:10,546 --> 01:48:11,820
I don't know, actually.

2806
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,410
Maybe it might be totally true.

2807
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:14,520
It might not be true at all.

2808
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:15,520
I really don't know.

2809
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:20,040
But not everything is that, that's not always true.

2810
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:23,730
If I go up to you in a bar and I say, I hate your neck tie.

2811
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:26,220
I'm being pretty aggressive with you, pretty strong.

2812
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:27,510
you might beat the outta me actually,

2813
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:28,860
or shoot me if I do that.

2814
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:30,930
Like an aggressive posture doesn't always get you

2815
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:32,340
the outcome that you want.

2816
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:33,778
Sometimes it requires

2817
01:48:33,778 --> 01:48:36,210
a more sophisticated Mediterranean posture.

2818
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:37,140
I mean, it kind of depends.

2819
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,210
It's a time and place thing.

2820
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:41,520
And they don't acknowledge that.

2821
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,740
It's like everything is this same template.

2822
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:47,760
And that's not the road to good decision making at all.

2823
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,050
- Since we're on the time period,

2824
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:51,240
let me ask you kind of almost cliche question,

2825
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:52,890
but it applies to you,

2826
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:54,900
which you've interviewed a lot of world leaders.

2827
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:55,733
- [Tucker] Yep.

2828
01:48:55,733 --> 01:48:57,893
- If you had the chance to interview Hitler

2829
01:48:57,893 --> 01:49:01,053
in '39, '40, '41.

2830
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:04,980
First of all, would you do it?

2831
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:06,270
And how would you do it?

2832
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:09,090
I assume you would do it given who you are.

2833
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:11,910
- Man, it would be a massive cost for doing it.

2834
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:13,890
It may destroy my life to interview Putin, though.

2835
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:15,750
I can tell you as much as I want

2836
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,250
that I'm not a Putin defender,

2837
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:18,450
I only care about the United States.

2838
01:49:18,450 --> 01:49:19,590
That's a hundred percent true.

2839
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:20,700
Anyone who knows me will tell you what's true,

2840
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:21,550
I keep saying it.

2841
01:49:22,970 --> 01:49:23,910
But history may record me to the extent

2842
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:28,713
it records me at all as a tool of Putin, a hater of America.

2843
01:49:30,450 --> 01:49:33,270
That seems absurd to me, but absurd things happen.

2844
01:49:33,270 --> 01:49:34,770
So, what would I ask Hitler?

2845
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:36,630
I don't even know.

2846
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:40,920
I guess that I would probably ask him, what I asked Putin,

2847
01:49:40,920 --> 01:49:44,190
which is what I ask everybody, like, what's your motive?

2848
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:46,950
Why did you do, I mean, if he'd already gone into Poland,

2849
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:48,510
like, why are you doing that?

2850
01:49:48,510 --> 01:49:49,563
what's your goal?

2851
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:54,570
And then the question is, is he gonna answer honestly.

2852
01:49:54,570 --> 01:49:55,403
I don't know.

2853
01:49:55,403 --> 01:49:59,010
You can't make someone answer a question honestly.

2854
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:03,090
You can only sort of shut up while they talk

2855
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:05,695
and then let people decide what they think of the answer.

2856
01:50:05,695 --> 01:50:06,528
- Well, just like in the bar fight,

2857
01:50:06,528 --> 01:50:07,361
there's different ways.

2858
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:08,194
You could- - There are different ways.

2859
01:50:08,194 --> 01:50:09,027
That's exactly right.

2860
01:50:09,027 --> 01:50:11,610
That's exactly, man, is that true.

2861
01:50:11,610 --> 01:50:13,350
That is absolutely right.

2862
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:16,410
- I mean, your energy with Putin, for example,

2863
01:50:16,410 --> 01:50:20,910
was such that it felt like he could trust you.

2864
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:22,770
I felt like he could tell you a lot.

2865
01:50:22,770 --> 01:50:25,170
- I just wanted to get it on the record.

2866
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:26,500
- [Lex] Yes. - That's all I wanted.

2867
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,650
- I think it was extremely like,

2868
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:32,640
we have to acknowledge how important that interview was

2869
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:36,630
for the record and for opening the door for conversation.

2870
01:50:36,630 --> 01:50:39,300
Like opening the door to conversation literally is the path

2871
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:42,960
to like more conversations and peace, peace talks.

2872
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:45,120
- Well, I would flip it around and say anyone who seeks

2873
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:49,350
to shut that down by focusing on a supermarket video

2874
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:51,630
of four minutes versus a two hour

2875
01:50:51,630 --> 01:50:54,120
and 15 minute long interview with a world leader.

2876
01:50:54,120 --> 01:50:56,220
Anyone who doesn't want more conversation,

2877
01:50:56,220 --> 01:51:00,930
who wants fewer facts, fewer perspectives is totalitarian,

2878
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:02,400
probably doesn't have good intent.

2879
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:06,915
I mean, I can honestly say for all my many manifold faults,

2880
01:51:06,915 --> 01:51:10,680
I've never tried to like, make people shut up.

2881
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:12,313
I just, it's not in me.

2882
01:51:12,313 --> 01:51:14,130
I don't believe in that.

2883
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:19,020
- So Putin's folks have shown interest

2884
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:21,420
of quite a while to speaking with me.

2885
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:23,913
So, you've spoken with him.

2886
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,610
What advice would you give?

2887
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:28,710
- Oh, do it immediately.

2888
01:51:28,710 --> 01:51:30,150
How's your Russian, by the way?

2889
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:31,560
- [Lex] Fluent. - Have you kept up With it?

2890
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:32,393
- Yeah, fluent.

2891
01:51:32,393 --> 01:51:35,090
So it would most likely be in Russian.

2892
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:36,990
So like that's the other thing

2893
01:51:36,990 --> 01:51:40,175
is I do have a question about language barrier.

2894
01:51:40,175 --> 01:51:41,790
Oh, like, did you feel was annoying?

2895
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:43,350
- It's horrible. - [Lex] Yeah.

2896
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:44,183
- It's horrible.

2897
01:51:44,183 --> 01:51:46,470
I mean the, I don't have much of a technique

2898
01:51:46,470 --> 01:51:51,030
as an interviewer other than listen really carefully.

2899
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:52,290
That's my only skill.

2900
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:53,640
I don't have the best questions.

2901
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,340
I certainly don't have the best questions.

2902
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:58,571
All I do that I'm proud of

2903
01:51:58,571 --> 01:52:00,330
and that I think works is I just listen super carefully.

2904
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:03,300
I never let a word go by that I'm not paying attention.

2905
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:04,470
It exhausts me, actually.

2906
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:08,250
But you can't do that in a foreign language

2907
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:09,570
because there's a delay.

2908
01:52:09,570 --> 01:52:11,340
Here I'm just whining, but it's real.

2909
01:52:11,340 --> 01:52:12,960
- Well, it's not whining.

2910
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:14,850
Like can you actually describe

2911
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:16,710
the technical details of that?

2912
01:52:16,710 --> 01:52:20,040
Are you hearing concurrently, like at the same time?

2913
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,500
- Yes, but there's a massive lag.

2914
01:52:22,500 --> 01:52:24,570
So what's happening is, so the translators,

2915
01:52:24,570 --> 01:52:26,880
so we were of course extremely uptight

2916
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,980
about the logistical details,

2917
01:52:28,980 --> 01:52:32,190
so we brought our own cameraman

2918
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:33,390
who I've been around the world with,

2919
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:35,730
who worked at Fox, came with me now.

2920
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:36,900
Amazing.

2921
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:41,900
And he did, I mean, it was our cameras, lighting everything.

2922
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,560
Like we had full control over that

2923
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:44,730
and we had control of the tape.

2924
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:46,380
The Russians also had their own cameras,

2925
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,570
and I don't know what they did with it.

2926
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:49,620
But we had full control of that,

2927
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:50,820
and we brought our own translator.

2928
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:51,900
We got our own translator

2929
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:55,620
because I don't trust anyone, right?

2930
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:58,080
So, I think we had a good translator.

2931
01:52:58,080 --> 01:53:01,260
We had two of them actually, 'cause they get exhausted.

2932
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:04,410
But the problem is, from my perspective,

2933
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:06,150
as someone who's like trying to think of a follow up

2934
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:08,730
and listen to the answer, Putin will talk

2935
01:53:08,730 --> 01:53:13,420
and in part of your ear hear the Slavic sounds

2936
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:17,400
and then over that is a guy

2937
01:53:17,400 --> 01:53:19,770
with a Slavic accent speaking English.

2938
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:21,210
And then you can hear Putin stop talking

2939
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:23,100
and then this guy's answer goes on

2940
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:25,500
for another 15, 20 seconds.

2941
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:28,440
So, it's super disconcerting and it's really hard.

2942
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:30,090
And the other thing is, it doesn't matter

2943
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:32,250
how good your translators are.

2944
01:53:32,250 --> 01:53:33,480
I'm interested in language,

2945
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,253
I speak only English fluently,

2946
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:38,680
but I'm really interested in language.

2947
01:53:39,906 --> 01:53:41,223
And I work in language.

2948
01:53:42,390 --> 01:53:45,300
It doesn't matter how good your translator is.

2949
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:49,080
In literature and in conversation, you miss so much

2950
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:51,149
if the language is moving for you.

2951
01:53:51,149 --> 01:53:53,460
I mean, you see this in Bible study,

2952
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:56,460
you see it in Dostoevsk, you see it everywhere.

2953
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:59,640
If you don't speak Aramaic, Hebrew, Russian,

2954
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,710
you're not really getting.

2955
01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:03,633
I mean, even in romance languages.

2956
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:08,319
I like Balzak, okay?

2957
01:54:08,319 --> 01:54:10,530
Who's obviously wrote in French.

2958
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:14,190
You read, "Pere Goriot," it's amazing novel, hilarious.

2959
01:54:14,190 --> 01:54:16,740
And it's like, you're not really getting it.

2960
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:18,210
And it's not that French and English

2961
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:19,590
are not that far apart.

2962
01:54:19,590 --> 01:54:22,200
Russian, like what?

2963
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:23,370
- Plus conversation.

2964
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:26,020
So the chemistry of conversation, the humor, the wit,

2965
01:54:27,076 --> 01:54:28,650
the play with words, all this stuff.

2966
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:29,547
- Exactly.

2967
01:54:29,547 --> 01:54:32,760
And my understanding of Russian as a lover

2968
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,200
of Russian literature in English

2969
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,720
is that it's not a simple language at all.

2970
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:38,704
The grammar's complex.

2971
01:54:38,704 --> 01:54:41,010
There's a lot that's expressed

2972
01:54:41,010 --> 01:54:42,450
that will be lost in the translation.

2973
01:54:42,450 --> 01:54:46,053
So yes, I mean the fact that you speak Native Russian,

2974
01:54:47,472 --> 01:54:48,960
I mean I would run that walk to that interview,

2975
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,370
'cause I think it would just be amazing.

2976
01:54:50,370 --> 01:54:53,220
You would get so much more out of it than I did.

2977
01:54:53,220 --> 01:54:56,190
- And we should say that you've met a lot of world leaders,

2978
01:54:56,190 --> 01:55:01,190
both Zelensky and Putin are intelligent, witty, even funny.

2979
01:55:01,770 --> 01:55:02,603
- [Tucker] Yes.

2980
01:55:02,603 --> 01:55:04,860
- So like there's a depth to the person

2981
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:07,440
that can be explored throughout conversation

2982
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,240
just on that element, the linguistic element.

2983
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:11,550
- For sure, and Putin speaks decent English.

2984
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:13,920
I spoke to him in English, so I know that.

2985
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,876
But he's not comfortable with it at all.

2986
01:55:16,876 --> 01:55:18,060
- [Lex] Right. - But Zelensky is, I think.

2987
01:55:18,060 --> 01:55:20,970
- No, well he's better than Putin in English,

2988
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:23,580
but he's still, the humor, the like, the intelligence,

2989
01:55:23,580 --> 01:55:25,800
all of that is not quite there in English.

2990
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,900
He says simple points.

2991
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:29,940
But the guy's a comedian.

2992
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:32,250
And he's a comedian primarily in Russian,

2993
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:33,510
the Russian language.

2994
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:36,873
So the Ukrainian language is now used mostly,

2995
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:40,654
primarily as a kind of symbol.

2996
01:55:40,654 --> 01:55:41,734
of independence. - [Tucker] I'm aware of that.

2997
01:55:41,734 --> 01:55:42,653
It's a political decision.

2998
01:55:42,653 --> 01:55:43,663
No, I know.

2999
01:55:43,663 --> 01:55:46,330
- And he is, you know, his really,

3000
01:55:46,330 --> 01:55:47,721
his native language is Russian language.

3001
01:55:47,721 --> 01:55:50,003
- [Tucker] Of course, as a lot of people in Ukraine.

3002
01:55:50,003 --> 01:55:51,150
- But you can also understand his position

3003
01:55:51,150 --> 01:55:53,790
that he might not want to be speaking Russian publicly.

3004
01:55:53,790 --> 01:55:55,453
That's something-

3005
01:55:55,453 --> 01:55:56,286
- I don't think they're allowed to speak

3006
01:55:56,286 --> 01:55:58,050
in Russia in some places in Ukraine, right?

3007
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:00,870
That's one of the reasons that Russia was so mad,

3008
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:03,363
is that they were attacking language.

3009
01:56:04,691 --> 01:56:05,610
And that's a fair complaint.

3010
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:06,900
Like, what?

3011
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:09,210
And by the way, if you haven't been to Moscow in a while,

3012
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:11,940
you should see it and you will pick up a million things

3013
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:13,890
that were invisible to me.

3014
01:56:13,890 --> 01:56:15,300
And you should assess it for yourself.

3015
01:56:15,300 --> 01:56:16,830
And my strong advice would be,

3016
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:19,950
even if you don't interview Putin, go over there,

3017
01:56:19,950 --> 01:56:23,730
spend a week there and assess what you think.

3018
01:56:23,730 --> 01:56:26,640
I mean, how restricted does the society feel?

3019
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,990
I mean, it would take a lot of balls to do this

3020
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:31,410
because I mean, whatever you decide,

3021
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:33,150
you'll be sucked into conversations

3022
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:33,983
that have nothing to do with you.

3023
01:56:33,983 --> 01:56:34,980
Political conversations. - [Lex] Yeah.

3024
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:37,740
- You're obviously not a political activist, right?

3025
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:38,573
You're an interviewer.

3026
01:56:38,573 --> 01:56:41,022
But I think it would be so interesting.

3027
01:56:41,022 --> 01:56:44,337
- But for interview itself, is there advice

3028
01:56:44,337 --> 01:56:47,100
you have about how to carry an interview?

3029
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,510
It is fundamentally different when you do it

3030
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:50,160
in the native language.

3031
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:54,660
- Yes, I mean, I think I approached...

3032
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:55,860
And maybe I did it incorrectly,

3033
01:56:55,860 --> 01:56:57,630
but this was the product of a lot of thought.

3034
01:56:57,630 --> 01:57:01,320
I was coming into that interview aware

3035
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:03,390
that he hadn't given an interview at all

3036
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:05,820
with anybody since the war started,

3037
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,740
so I had a million different questions.

3038
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,350
And as noted, I didn't ask them

3039
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:12,960
because I just wanted to focus on the war.

3040
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,970
But I mean, there's so many,

3041
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:17,108
I'll send you my notes that I wrote.

3042
01:57:17,108 --> 01:57:18,120
I was like a diligent little girl. (chuckles)

3043
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:19,902
- That would be amazing.

3044
01:57:19,902 --> 01:57:21,059
But I think- - (laughs) My interview.

3045
01:57:21,059 --> 01:57:22,903
All these questions, and some of them

3046
01:57:22,903 --> 01:57:25,290
I thought were pretty funny.

3047
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:28,320
- In your case, I think the very fact of the interview

3048
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,280
was the most important thing.

3049
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,690
- Yeah, that's probably right.

3050
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:31,830
The question that I really wanted

3051
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:33,120
to ask that I was almost gonna ask,

3052
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:35,190
'cause it made me laugh out loud.

3053
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:37,890
I was sitting having drinking coffee beforehand

3054
01:57:37,890 --> 01:57:40,350
with my producers and I was like, "I'm gonna go in there.

3055
01:57:40,350 --> 01:57:43,260
My first question's gonna be, Mr. President.

3056
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,260
I've been here in the Kremlin for two days preparing,

3057
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:48,960
and I haven't seen a single African American

3058
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:50,940
in a position of power in the Kremlin."

3059
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:51,773
- [Lex] Sure.

3060
01:57:52,877 --> 01:57:54,660
- (laughs) I thought that's too.

3061
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:56,640
- [Lex] Yeah. - Culturally specific and dry.

3062
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:59,310
And he'd be like, "This guy's freaking crazy."

3063
01:57:59,310 --> 01:58:01,312
- Yeah, yeah, you don't wanna open with a crazy.

3064
01:58:01,312 --> 01:58:02,692
with humor. - No, I know.

3065
01:58:02,692 --> 01:58:03,525
I know. - [Lex] All right.

3066
01:58:03,525 --> 01:58:05,010
- That's probably, doesn't translate.

3067
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:05,843
- It doesn't.

3068
01:58:05,843 --> 01:58:07,470
Oh yeah, and there'll be a small delay

3069
01:58:07,470 --> 01:58:09,011
where you have to wait for the-

3070
01:58:09,011 --> 01:58:09,844
- (laughs) Like what?

3071
01:58:09,844 --> 01:58:10,763
- [Lex] To see if it lands or not.

3072
01:58:10,763 --> 01:58:12,600
- This is not America.

3073
01:58:12,600 --> 01:58:17,600
- At Fox, you were for a time, the most popular host.

3074
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:20,580
After Fox, you've garnered a huge amount

3075
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:22,020
of attention as well.

3076
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:24,360
Same, probably more.

3077
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:28,560
Do you worry that popularity and just that attention

3078
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:31,530
gets to your head is a kind of drug

3079
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:33,570
that clouds your thinking?

3080
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:34,530
- You think?

3081
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:36,570
I live in a spiritual graveyard

3082
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:38,280
of people killed by the quest for fame.

3083
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,350
Yes, I have lived in it.

3084
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,060
I mean, I would say the one advantage,

3085
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:44,100
the two advantages I have.

3086
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:47,670
And one, I have a happy family and a stable family

3087
01:58:47,670 --> 01:58:49,170
and a stable group of friends,

3088
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:51,870
which is just the greatest blessing

3089
01:58:51,870 --> 01:58:56,870
and a strong love of nature and that my family share.

3090
01:58:57,957 --> 01:58:59,463
So, I'm in nature every day.

3091
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:02,610
And I have a whole series of rituals

3092
01:59:02,610 --> 01:59:04,530
designed to keep me from becoming the asshole

3093
01:59:04,530 --> 01:59:05,880
that I could easily become.

3094
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:09,393
But no, of course.

3095
01:59:11,690 --> 01:59:15,000
And I don't want to beat up on, I'm grateful to Elon

3096
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,900
who gave me a platform, and I mean that sincerely,

3097
01:59:18,900 --> 01:59:23,400
but I definitely don't spend a lot of time on social media

3098
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,450
or on the internet for that exact reason.

3099
01:59:26,561 --> 01:59:28,800
Well, first of all, I think it's, as I've said,

3100
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,040
a much more controlled environment than we acknowledge.

3101
01:59:32,040 --> 01:59:33,960
And I don't want lies in my head,

3102
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:36,990
but I also don't want to become the sort of person

3103
01:59:36,990 --> 01:59:39,600
who's seeking the adulation of strangers.

3104
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:41,373
I think that's soul poison.

3105
01:59:42,754 --> 01:59:45,690
And I said earlier that I think that the desire

3106
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:48,390
for power and money will kill you.

3107
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:51,150
And I believe that, and I've seen it a lot.

3108
01:59:51,150 --> 01:59:55,110
But I also think the desire for the love of people

3109
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:57,993
you don't know is every bit as poisonous maybe more so.

3110
01:59:58,890 --> 02:00:00,780
And so, yes, and it's not just because

3111
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:04,413
I've obviously spent most of my life in public.

3112
02:00:05,362 --> 02:00:07,080
And in fact I don't spend my life in public

3113
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:08,550
and I'm completely private person.

3114
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:11,463
But professionally I've spent my life in public.

3115
02:00:12,465 --> 02:00:13,298
But it's not just that.

3116
02:00:13,298 --> 02:00:14,490
It's like social media makes everybody

3117
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:16,050
into a cable news host.

3118
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:18,090
And we were talking off the air, my new, I just,

3119
02:00:18,090 --> 02:00:19,890
I'm obsessed with this, but I don't know enough about it,

3120
02:00:19,890 --> 02:00:21,840
but here's what I do know.

3121
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:24,810
South Korea, amazing country, great people.

3122
02:00:24,810 --> 02:00:26,700
I grew up around Koreans, probably no group,

3123
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:28,500
if I can generalize about a group

3124
02:00:28,500 --> 02:00:29,730
that I like more than Koreans,

3125
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:34,730
are just smart, funny, honest, brave.

3126
02:00:35,130 --> 02:00:36,630
I really like Koreans, I always have.

3127
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:37,463
My whole life growing up

3128
02:00:37,463 --> 02:00:39,510
in southern California with Koreans.

3129
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:41,940
South Korea is like dying.

3130
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:43,320
It's literally dying.

3131
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:46,200
It's way below replacement rate in fertility.

3132
02:00:46,200 --> 02:00:47,883
Its suicide rate is astronomical.

3133
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,610
Why is that?

3134
02:00:50,610 --> 02:00:52,170
It's a rich country.

3135
02:00:52,170 --> 02:00:53,640
But of course, I dunno the answer,

3136
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:55,860
but I suspect it has something to do

3137
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:58,470
with the penetration of technology

3138
02:00:58,470 --> 02:01:02,100
into South Korean society is I think one of the highest,

3139
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:04,200
certainly one of the highest in the world.

3140
02:01:04,200 --> 02:01:05,850
People live online there.

3141
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:07,080
And there was a belief in,

3142
02:01:07,080 --> 02:01:08,970
for a bunch of reasons in South Korea

3143
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:10,440
that Western technology would be

3144
02:01:10,440 --> 02:01:12,930
a liberating progressive force.

3145
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:14,820
And I think it's been the opposite.

3146
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:16,170
It's my sense, strong sense.

3147
02:01:16,170 --> 02:01:18,270
And I think it's true in this country too.

3148
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:20,460
And I don't understand how people can ignore the decline

3149
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:22,860
in life expectancy or the rise in fentanyl use.

3150
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:24,990
Like, it's not just about China shipping

3151
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:26,700
precursor chemicals to Mexico.

3152
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:28,260
It's like, why would you take that shit?

3153
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:30,150
- I hope those two things aren't coupled.

3154
02:01:30,150 --> 02:01:33,090
Technological advancement and the erosion.

3155
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:35,100
- Well, let me ask you, and I know you're a technologist,

3156
02:01:35,100 --> 02:01:36,600
and I respect it.

3157
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:37,797
And there's a lot about technology that I like

3158
02:01:37,797 --> 02:01:38,910
and it benefited from.

3159
02:01:38,910 --> 02:01:40,200
I had back surgery and it worked okay,

3160
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:42,570
so I'm not against all technology.

3161
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:46,110
But can you name a technology,

3162
02:01:46,110 --> 02:01:48,900
a big technology in the last 20 years

3163
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:52,800
that we can say conclusively has improved people's lives?

3164
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,540
- Well, conclusive is a tough thing.

3165
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:56,310
- [Tucker] Pretty conclusively.

3166
02:01:56,310 --> 02:01:57,460
That we can brag about.

3167
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:00,840
- Well you've criticized Google search recently,

3168
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:05,760
but I think making the world knowledge accessible to anyone

3169
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:08,340
anywhere across the world through Google search.

3170
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:10,080
- Well, I love that, I love that idea.

3171
02:02:10,080 --> 02:02:11,250
Are people better informed?

3172
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:13,710
Are they more superstitious and misled

3173
02:02:13,710 --> 02:02:15,750
than they were 20 years ago? (laughs)

3174
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:17,460
It's not close.

3175
02:02:17,460 --> 02:02:18,480
- Well, no, I don't know.

3176
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:19,980
I think they are more informed.

3177
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:22,470
It is just revealing the ignorance.

3178
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:25,200
The internet has revealed the ignorance that people have.

3179
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:28,200
But I think the ignorance has been decreasing gradually.

3180
02:02:28,200 --> 02:02:29,610
And like, if you look even,

3181
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:32,640
you can criticize places like Wikipedia a lot

3182
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:35,940
and very many aspects of Wikipedia are very biased.

3183
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:39,870
But when you, most of it are actually topics

3184
02:02:39,870 --> 02:02:41,280
that don't have any bias in them

3185
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,390
because they're not political,

3186
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:44,190
so there's no battle over those topics.

3187
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:45,023
- [Tucker] Right.

3188
02:02:45,023 --> 02:02:45,930
- And most of Wikipedia.

3189
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:47,238
- [Tucker] I think that's true.

3190
02:02:47,238 --> 02:02:49,290
- Is like the fastest way to learn about a thing.

3191
02:02:49,290 --> 02:02:50,490
- I couldn't agree more.

3192
02:02:50,490 --> 02:02:52,560
You can very quickly imagine you're an expert.

3193
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:55,470
And that may be the problem, I think.

3194
02:02:55,470 --> 02:02:56,303
No, it's true.

3195
02:02:56,303 --> 02:02:57,630
I just experienced it in Moscow.

3196
02:02:57,630 --> 02:03:00,360
It's like, again, I feel like I'm in the top 1%

3197
02:03:00,360 --> 02:03:04,080
for information, certainly intake because it's my job.

3198
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,060
And I had literally...

3199
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:07,350
And I'm always outta the country.

3200
02:03:07,350 --> 02:03:09,845
I've been around the world many times.

3201
02:03:09,845 --> 02:03:11,790
Like I feel like I know a lot about the rest of the world

3202
02:03:11,790 --> 02:03:13,290
or I thought I did.

3203
02:03:13,290 --> 02:03:16,053
And how did I not know any of that?

3204
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:20,580
And maybe I'm just like unusually ignorant or something,

3205
02:03:20,580 --> 02:03:21,690
or reading the wrong things.

3206
02:03:21,690 --> 02:03:22,590
I don't know what it was.

3207
02:03:22,590 --> 02:03:27,590
But all I know is the digital information sources

3208
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:30,240
that I used to understand.

3209
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:33,090
Just something as simple as what's the city of Moscow like.

3210
02:03:33,090 --> 02:03:34,470
We're completely inadequate.

3211
02:03:34,470 --> 02:03:38,340
And anyway, look, I just am worried

3212
02:03:38,340 --> 02:03:42,120
that we're missing the obvious signs.

3213
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:45,123
And the obvious signs are reproduction,

3214
02:03:46,590 --> 02:03:49,923
life expectancy, sobriety.

3215
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:54,000
If you have a society where people just can't deal

3216
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,450
with being sober, don't want to have children

3217
02:03:57,450 --> 02:04:01,560
and are dying younger, you have an extremely sick,

3218
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:04,080
you have a suicidal society, okay?

3219
02:04:04,080 --> 02:04:05,820
And I'm not even blaming anyone for,

3220
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:07,870
I'm just saying objectively that is true.

3221
02:04:08,953 --> 02:04:10,590
And the measure of a health of your society

3222
02:04:10,590 --> 02:04:13,020
is the number of children that you have

3223
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:14,250
and how well they do.

3224
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:15,300
It's super simple.

3225
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:16,133
That's the next generation.

3226
02:04:16,133 --> 02:04:17,760
We all die.

3227
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,410
And what replaces us.

3228
02:04:19,410 --> 02:04:23,073
And if you don't care, then you're suicidal.

3229
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:25,290
And maybe other things too.

3230
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:26,490
But that's all I'm saying.

3231
02:04:26,490 --> 02:04:28,920
So, what happened to South Korea?

3232
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,930
Like, why can't anyone answer the question?

3233
02:04:30,930 --> 02:04:33,390
They're great people, they're rich,

3234
02:04:33,390 --> 02:04:35,400
they have all these advantages.

3235
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:37,770
They're on the cutting edge of every American.

3236
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:39,720
For a foreign country, they're more American

3237
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:43,440
than maybe any other country other than Canada.

3238
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,510
And like what happened?

3239
02:04:45,510 --> 02:04:47,070
- And I mean, your fundamental war

3240
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:48,960
is the same kind of thing might be happening

3241
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,760
or will happen in the United States.

3242
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:51,840
- Well, lemme just ask you this.

3243
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:54,150
I think North Korea seems like the most dystopian,

3244
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:55,590
horrible place in the world, right?

3245
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:56,423
Obviously.

3246
02:04:56,423 --> 02:04:58,200
It's a by word for dystopia, right?

3247
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,033
North Korean.

3248
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:01,380
I use it all the time, and I mean it.

3249
02:05:01,380 --> 02:05:02,940
If in a hundred years

3250
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:05,490
there are more North Koreans still alive

3251
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:09,270
than there are South Koreans, what does that tell us?

3252
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,980
- [Lex] Yeah, that's something to worry about.

3253
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:13,680
- But like, how did it happen?

3254
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,513
Like why?

3255
02:05:14,513 --> 02:05:15,346
I'm interested in the why.

3256
02:05:15,346 --> 02:05:17,220
This is a question I asked Putin.

3257
02:05:17,220 --> 02:05:20,850
Sometimes we don't know why, but why does no one ask why.

3258
02:05:20,850 --> 02:05:24,960
- I've seen a lot of increased distrust in science,

3259
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,450
which is deserved in many places.

3260
02:05:27,450 --> 02:05:31,679
It just worries me because some of the greatest inventions

3261
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:35,730
of humanity come from science and technological innovation.

3262
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:37,680
- Okay, then let me ask you a couple quick questions

3263
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:39,233
and perhaps you have the answer.

3264
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:41,392
And I've always assumed that was true.

3265
02:05:41,392 --> 02:05:42,420
And I should say that when I was a kid,

3266
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:43,470
I lived in La Jolla, California,

3267
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:46,200
next to the Salk Institute named after Jonas Salk,

3268
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:47,820
a resident of La Jolla, California,

3269
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:50,250
who created the polio vaccine and saved untold millions.

3270
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:53,730
And so my belief, which is still my belief actually,

3271
02:05:53,730 --> 02:05:54,600
that's a great thing.

3272
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:57,753
It's one of the great additions to human flourishing ever.

3273
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:03,620
But if technology is so great,

3274
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,600
why is life expectancy going down

3275
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:08,370
and why are fewer people having kids,

3276
02:06:08,370 --> 02:06:10,950
and why would anybody who has internet access

3277
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:12,153
every use fentanyl?

3278
02:06:13,438 --> 02:06:15,600
What is that, what is going on?

3279
02:06:15,600 --> 02:06:17,370
And until we can answer that question,

3280
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:20,220
I think we have to assume the question

3281
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:21,690
of whether technology is a net good

3282
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:25,083
or net bad is unresolved, like at best, right?

3283
02:06:25,950 --> 02:06:27,240
- At best, perhaps.

3284
02:06:27,240 --> 02:06:30,820
But technology is the very tool that which will allow us

3285
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:32,640
to have that kind of discourse to figure out

3286
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:33,924
to do science better.

3287
02:06:33,924 --> 02:06:35,100
- I mean, I want that to be true.

3288
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:38,040
And when you said that the internet allows people

3289
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:39,900
to escape the darkness of ignorance.

3290
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,672
Man, that resonated with me,

3291
02:06:41,672 --> 02:06:43,680
'cause I felt that way in 1993, 4

3292
02:06:43,680 --> 02:06:46,170
when it was first starting and I first got on it.

3293
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:47,730
And I thought, "Man, this is amazing."

3294
02:06:47,730 --> 02:06:50,369
You can talk for free to anyone around the world.

3295
02:06:50,369 --> 02:06:51,510
This is gonna be great.

3296
02:06:51,510 --> 02:06:52,410
But lemme just ask you this.

3297
02:06:52,410 --> 02:06:53,670
This is something I've never gotten over

3298
02:06:53,670 --> 02:06:55,350
or gotten a straight answer to.

3299
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:58,470
Why is it that in any European city,

3300
02:06:58,470 --> 02:07:01,230
the greatest buildings indisputably

3301
02:07:01,230 --> 02:07:03,903
were built before electricity and the machine age?

3302
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:07,890
Why has no one ever built a medieval cathedral

3303
02:07:07,890 --> 02:07:10,019
in the modern era ever?

3304
02:07:10,019 --> 02:07:13,052
What is that? - Well, indisputably

3305
02:07:13,052 --> 02:07:15,180
you're have a presumption

3306
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:17,250
we have a good definition of what beauty is.

3307
02:07:17,250 --> 02:07:18,594
There's a lot of people-

3308
02:07:18,594 --> 02:07:19,427
- Right, let's be specific.

3309
02:07:19,427 --> 02:07:21,570
Pick a European city or any city in the world

3310
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:24,930
and tell me that there's a prettier building

3311
02:07:24,930 --> 02:07:28,110
than say Notre Dame before it was set fire to.

3312
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:30,393
- There's other sources of prettiness and beauty.

3313
02:07:30,393 --> 02:07:31,800
- That it's purely in architecture.

3314
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:32,633
Of course, of course.

3315
02:07:32,633 --> 02:07:34,650
Trees are prettier than any building in my opinion, right,

3316
02:07:34,650 --> 02:07:37,688
so I agree with you there. - But also there could be,

3317
02:07:37,688 --> 02:07:40,470
I mean I grew up in the pre-internet age.

3318
02:07:40,470 --> 02:07:42,450
- [Tucker] Good, good.

3319
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:44,580
- But if you grew up in the internet age,

3320
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:47,040
I think your eyes would be more open

3321
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:50,790
to beauty that's digital, that is in a digital.

3322
02:07:50,790 --> 02:07:51,990
- I'm not discounting the possibility

3323
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:53,340
of digital beauty at all.

3324
02:07:53,340 --> 02:07:56,310
And the Ted Kaczynski in me wants to.

3325
02:07:56,310 --> 02:07:58,410
But that's too close-minded, I agree.

3326
02:07:58,410 --> 02:08:00,780
I'm completely willing to believe

3327
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:02,177
there is such a thing as digital beauty.

3328
02:08:02,177 --> 02:08:04,020
I mean I have digital pictures of my phone,

3329
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:06,120
of my dogs and kids, so I know that there is.

3330
02:08:06,120 --> 02:08:09,150
But purely in the realm of architecture,

3331
02:08:09,150 --> 02:08:10,563
'cause it's like limited.

3332
02:08:11,453 --> 02:08:15,390
And it is one of the pure expressions of human creativity.

3333
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:18,810
We need places to live and work and worship and eat,

3334
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:22,140
and so we build buildings and every civilization has.

3335
02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:25,050
But the machine age, the industrial age

3336
02:08:25,050 --> 02:08:29,940
seemed to have decreased the quality

3337
02:08:29,940 --> 02:08:32,340
and the beauty in that one expression

3338
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:33,960
of human creativity architecture.

3339
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:35,729
And why is that?

3340
02:08:35,729 --> 02:08:36,562
- Well, I could also argue

3341
02:08:36,562 --> 02:08:38,490
that I'm a big sucker for bridges.

3342
02:08:38,490 --> 02:08:42,780
And modern bridges can give older bridges

3343
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:44,040
that run for their money.

3344
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:44,873
- I like bridges too.

3345
02:08:44,873 --> 02:08:46,860
So I agree with you sort of.

3346
02:08:46,860 --> 02:08:49,350
But like the Brooklyn Bridge, I don't know

3347
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:51,840
that there's any modern bridges

3348
02:08:51,840 --> 02:08:56,193
that was built in late 19th century.

3349
02:08:57,930 --> 02:08:59,490
Very much in the industrial age.

3350
02:08:59,490 --> 02:09:01,800
But I'm just saying like the great cathedrals of Europe.

3351
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:02,670
- [Lex] Yeah.

3352
02:09:02,670 --> 02:09:07,440
- Even the pyramids, whoever built them, it doesn't,

3353
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,550
it seems like if you, it's like super obvious.

3354
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:12,840
I'm just like, I'm dealing on the autism level here.

3355
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:13,980
Just like, well why is that?

3356
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:15,573
But that's a good way to start.

3357
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:19,770
If all of a sudden you have electricity and hydraulics

3358
02:09:19,770 --> 02:09:21,000
and you have access to, I mean,

3359
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,640
I have machines in my wood shop at home

3360
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:26,070
that are so much more advanced in anything

3361
02:09:26,070 --> 02:09:30,360
than any cathedral builder in 15th century Europe had.

3362
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:32,460
And yet there's neither I nor anyone know

3363
02:09:32,460 --> 02:09:34,230
could even begin to understand

3364
02:09:34,230 --> 02:09:36,990
how a flying buttress was built, right?

3365
02:09:36,990 --> 02:09:39,990
And so, what is that?

3366
02:09:39,990 --> 02:09:42,600
- And the other question is also consider

3367
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:46,443
that whatever is creating this technology is unstoppable.

3368
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:49,002
- And well there's that, yeah.

3369
02:09:49,002 --> 02:09:50,820
- And the question is like, how do you steer it then?

3370
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:53,700
You have to look in a realist way at the world

3371
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:56,400
and say that if you don't, somebody else will.

3372
02:09:56,400 --> 02:10:01,126
And you want to do it in a safe way.

3373
02:10:01,126 --> 02:10:02,220
I mean, this is the Manhattan project.

3374
02:10:02,220 --> 02:10:03,630
- Was the Manhattan project a good idea

3375
02:10:03,630 --> 02:10:04,890
to create nuclear weapons?

3376
02:10:04,890 --> 02:10:06,810
That's an easy call, no.

3377
02:10:06,810 --> 02:10:09,060
- For me it's an easy call in retrospect.

3378
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:10,740
In retrospect, yes.

3379
02:10:10,740 --> 02:10:13,890
Because it seems like it stopped world wars.

3380
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:16,440
So the mutually assure destruction

3381
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:19,440
seems to have ended wars, ended major military.

3382
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:23,520
- Well it's been what, 80 years?

3383
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:25,860
Not even 80 years. 79.

3384
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:30,860
And so we haven't had a world war in 79 years.

3385
02:10:31,770 --> 02:10:34,110
But one nuclear exchange would of course

3386
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:37,680
kill more people than all wars in human history combined.

3387
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:40,680
- You're saying '79 makes it sound like you're counting.

3388
02:10:40,680 --> 02:10:42,870
- I'm counting, 'cause I think it obviously

3389
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:44,070
it's like completely demonic

3390
02:10:44,070 --> 02:10:45,960
and everyone pretends like it's great.

3391
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:47,640
Nuclear weapons are evil.

3392
02:10:47,640 --> 02:10:48,473
- [Lex] Yeah, no, absolutely.

3393
02:10:48,473 --> 02:10:52,320
- The use of them is evil and the technology itself is evil.

3394
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:53,820
And in my opinion, I mean it's like,

3395
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:55,740
if you can't, that's just so obvious.

3396
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:57,552
And that's what what I'm saying is like,

3397
02:10:57,552 --> 02:10:59,760
I'm not against all technology.

3398
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:01,758
I took a shower this morning.

3399
02:11:01,758 --> 02:11:03,960
It was powered by an electric pump.

3400
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:05,730
- [Lex] Yep. - Heated by a water heater.

3401
02:11:05,730 --> 02:11:07,320
Like I loved it.

3402
02:11:07,320 --> 02:11:09,060
I sat in an electric sauna.

3403
02:11:09,060 --> 02:11:12,513
Like I'm not against all technology obviously,

3404
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:16,020
but the mindless worship of technology.

3405
02:11:16,020 --> 02:11:16,920
- Sure.

3406
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:18,780
Mindless worship of anything is pretty bad.

3407
02:11:18,780 --> 02:11:19,770
- But I'm just saying, so you said,

3408
02:11:19,770 --> 02:11:21,360
let's approach this from a realist perspective.

3409
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:25,710
Okay, if we think that there is a reasonable,

3410
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:28,830
or even a potential chance

3411
02:11:28,830 --> 02:11:31,020
it could happen maybe on the margins,

3412
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:35,010
let's assign it a 15% chance that AI, for example,

3413
02:11:35,010 --> 02:11:38,070
gets away from us and we are now ruled by machines

3414
02:11:38,070 --> 02:11:38,940
that may actually hate us.

3415
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:40,190
Who knows what they want.

3416
02:11:41,430 --> 02:11:46,200
Why wouldn't we use force to stop that from happening?

3417
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:48,600
So you're walking down the street in midtown Manhattan,

3418
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:49,770
it's midnight, you've had a few drinks,

3419
02:11:49,770 --> 02:11:50,603
you're coming from dinner,

3420
02:11:50,603 --> 02:11:52,301
you're walking back to your apartment.

3421
02:11:52,301 --> 02:11:54,109
A guy, a very thuggish looking,

3422
02:11:54,109 --> 02:11:56,370
guy young man approaches you.

3423
02:11:56,370 --> 02:11:58,020
He's 50 feet away.

3424
02:11:58,020 --> 02:12:00,870
He pulls out a handgun, he lifts it up to you.

3425
02:12:00,870 --> 02:12:02,160
You also are armed.

3426
02:12:02,160 --> 02:12:04,310
Do you shoot him or do you wait to get shot

3427
02:12:05,220 --> 02:12:07,680
because all the data, look, he hasn't shot you.

3428
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:08,670
He's not committed a crime

3429
02:12:08,670 --> 02:12:09,900
other than carrying a weapon in New York City.

3430
02:12:09,900 --> 02:12:11,610
But maybe he's got a license you don't know.

3431
02:12:11,610 --> 02:12:12,443
Could be legal.

3432
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,690
But he's pointing a gun at you.

3433
02:12:15,690 --> 02:12:18,720
Is it fair to kill him before he kills you?

3434
02:12:18,720 --> 02:12:21,220
Even though you can't prove that he will kill you.

3435
02:12:22,650 --> 02:12:24,930
- If I knew my skills with a gun

3436
02:12:24,930 --> 02:12:26,100
because he already has the gun off.

3437
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:26,933
- Right, but it turns out

3438
02:12:26,933 --> 02:12:30,150
that you have some confidence in your ability

3439
02:12:30,150 --> 02:12:31,870
to stop the threat by force. - [Lex] Okay, okay, yeah.

3440
02:12:31,870 --> 02:12:33,330
- Are you justified in doing that?

3441
02:12:33,330 --> 02:12:34,500
- I just like this picture.

3442
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:36,360
Am I wearing a cowboy hat?

3443
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:38,250
- No, no, but you are wearing cowboy boots

3444
02:12:38,250 --> 02:12:39,390
and they're clicking on the cobblestone,

3445
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:40,590
actually you're wearing the meat packing,

3446
02:12:40,590 --> 02:12:41,423
okay? - Okay, great.

3447
02:12:41,423 --> 02:12:43,041
I like this picture. - [Tucker] Yeah.

3448
02:12:43,041 --> 02:12:45,630
- I think about this a lot actually, no.

3449
02:12:45,630 --> 02:12:47,790
Yeah, I understand your point.

3450
02:12:47,790 --> 02:12:50,940
But also, I think that metaphor falls apart

3451
02:12:50,940 --> 02:12:55,940
if there's other nations at play here.

3452
02:12:57,630 --> 02:13:00,810
So, if the same as with the nuclear bomb.

3453
02:13:00,810 --> 02:13:04,860
If US doesn't build it, will other nations build it?

3454
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:08,910
The Soviet Union build it, China or Nazi Germany.

3455
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:10,740
- We faced this, I mean, we faced this

3456
02:13:10,740 --> 02:13:14,340
and the last president to try and keep in a meaningful way

3457
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:17,140
nuclear proliferation under control was John F. Kennedy.

3458
02:13:18,068 --> 02:13:19,630
And look what happened to him.

3459
02:13:19,630 --> 02:13:22,230
- What's your suggestion?

3460
02:13:22,230 --> 02:13:24,750
Wasn't it inevitable? - But hold on.

3461
02:13:24,750 --> 02:13:27,000
Well, their position in 1962

3462
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,223
was no, it's absolutely not inevitable.

3463
02:13:30,556 --> 02:13:33,090
Or perhaps it's inevitable in the sense

3464
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:35,850
that our death is inevitable, but as human beings.

3465
02:13:35,850 --> 02:13:38,490
But we fight against the dying of the light anyway,

3466
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:40,770
because that's the right thing to do.

3467
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,840
No, we were willing to use force

3468
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:44,730
to prevent other countries from getting the bomb

3469
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:47,070
because we thought that would be really terrible.

3470
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:49,710
'cause we acknowledged that while there were upsides

3471
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:51,870
to nuclear weapons, just like there were upsides to AI,

3472
02:13:51,870 --> 02:13:54,933
the downside was terrifying in the hands of...

3473
02:13:54,933 --> 02:13:57,000
I mean, that's the thing that I kind of don't get.

3474
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:01,080
It's like the applications of that technology

3475
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:04,620
in the hands of people who mean to do harm and destroy.

3476
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:06,750
It's like so obviously terrifying.

3477
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:07,980
- It's not so obvious to me.

3478
02:14:07,980 --> 02:14:09,870
What I'm terrified about is probably a similar thing

3479
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:12,180
that you're terrified about, is using that technology

3480
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:14,280
to manipulate people's minds.

3481
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:18,780
That's much more reasonable to me as an expectation.

3482
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:21,951
A real threat that's possible in the next few years.

3483
02:14:21,951 --> 02:14:23,070
- But what matters more than that?

3484
02:14:23,070 --> 02:14:25,020
- Well, I think that could lead to like

3485
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:28,170
destruction of human civilization through other humans,

3486
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:30,570
for example, starting nuclear wars.

3487
02:14:30,570 --> 02:14:32,730
- Yeah, well, I mean this is one of the reasons

3488
02:14:32,730 --> 02:14:35,310
I wasn't afraid in the Vladimir Putin interview,

3489
02:14:35,310 --> 02:14:37,473
'cause it's like it's all ending anyway.

3490
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:40,166
You know what I mean? - [Lex] Yeah.

3491
02:14:40,166 --> 02:14:41,700
- Might as well dance on the deck of the Titanic.

3492
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:43,320
Don't be a pussy, enjoy it.

3493
02:14:43,320 --> 02:14:46,620
- I think we will forever fight against

3494
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:49,662
the dying of the light as the entirety of the civil.

3495
02:14:49,662 --> 02:14:50,940
- Someone the other day said that Biden

3496
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:53,310
ascribed that to Churchill.

3497
02:14:53,310 --> 02:14:55,140
That was a Churchill quote. - Hmm.

3498
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:56,280
- That's kind of what I'm saying.

3499
02:14:56,280 --> 02:14:59,190
It's like if you live in a society

3500
02:14:59,190 --> 02:15:01,053
where people don't read anymore,

3501
02:15:03,870 --> 02:15:06,393
like people are by definition much more ignorant,

3502
02:15:07,626 --> 02:15:10,170
but they don't know it.

3503
02:15:10,170 --> 02:15:12,480
It's like, I do think the Wikipedia culture,

3504
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:14,160
and I think there are cool things about Wikipedia,

3505
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:17,310
certainly it's ease of use is like high and that's great.

3506
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:19,830
But people get the sense that like,

3507
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:21,600
oh, I know a lot about you know,

3508
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:22,623
this or that or the other thing.

3509
02:15:22,623 --> 02:15:25,080
And it's like the key to wisdom.

3510
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,610
Again, the key to wise decision making

3511
02:15:26,610 --> 02:15:28,770
is knowing what you don't know.

3512
02:15:28,770 --> 02:15:30,390
And it's just so important to be reminded

3513
02:15:30,390 --> 02:15:31,710
of what a dummy you are

3514
02:15:31,710 --> 02:15:33,776
and how ignorant you are all the time.

3515
02:15:33,776 --> 02:15:34,609
- [Lex] Yeah.

3516
02:15:34,609 --> 02:15:35,442
- That's why I like having daughters.

3517
02:15:35,442 --> 02:15:38,550
It's like it's never far from mind how flawed I am.

3518
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:39,510
And that's important.

3519
02:15:39,510 --> 02:15:42,330
- Yeah, in the same way I hope to be a dad one day.

3520
02:15:42,330 --> 02:15:43,728
- You should have a ton of kids.

3521
02:15:43,728 --> 02:15:44,561
Are you gonna have a ton of pups?

3522
02:15:44,561 --> 02:15:46,050
- Five, oh pup.

3523
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:46,950
You mean like kids? - Children.

3524
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:48,180
- Yes, five.

3525
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,500
But also I've been thinking of getting a dog,

3526
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:50,730
but unrelated.

3527
02:15:50,730 --> 02:15:52,260
I would love to have like five or six kids.

3528
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:53,460
Yeah, for sure.

3529
02:15:53,460 --> 02:15:55,263
- Have you found a victim yet?

3530
02:15:56,372 --> 02:15:59,756
- (chuckles) You make it sound so romantic, Tucker.

3531
02:15:59,756 --> 02:16:01,890
- (laughs) Just joking, I love it.

3532
02:16:01,890 --> 02:16:03,960
No, you should totally do that.

3533
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:05,280
- Yeah, 100%.

3534
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:06,930
But also in terms of being humble,

3535
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:08,880
I do jiu-jitsu, it's in martial art

3536
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,820
where you get your ass kicked all the time.

3537
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:10,890
- [Tucker] Yeah, I love that.

3538
02:16:10,890 --> 02:16:12,060
- It's nice to get your ass kicked.

3539
02:16:12,060 --> 02:16:15,024
Physical humbling is unlike anything else I think,

3540
02:16:15,024 --> 02:16:18,060
'cause we're kind of monkeys at heart

3541
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:20,490
and just getting your ass kicked just really helpful.

3542
02:16:20,490 --> 02:16:23,003
- I agree, I've had it happen to me twice.

3543
02:16:23,003 --> 02:16:24,450
- (chuckles) Twice is enough.

3544
02:16:24,450 --> 02:16:26,130
- It got me to quit drinking.

3545
02:16:26,130 --> 02:16:28,530
I was good at starting fights, not good at winning them.

3546
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:31,170
But no, I completely agree with that.

3547
02:16:31,170 --> 02:16:32,820
- Let me ask you, you've been pretty close

3548
02:16:32,820 --> 02:16:34,022
with Donald Trump.

3549
02:16:34,889 --> 02:16:39,870
Your private texts about him around the 2020 election

3550
02:16:39,870 --> 02:16:41,490
were made public.

3551
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:44,702
In one of them you said that you passionately hate Trump.

3552
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:47,129
When that came out,

3553
02:16:47,129 --> 02:16:50,309
you said that you actually know you love him.

3554
02:16:50,309 --> 02:16:53,040
So, how do you explain the difference?

3555
02:16:53,040 --> 02:16:55,290
- My texts reflect a lot of things,

3556
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:57,930
including how I feel at the moment that I sent them.

3557
02:16:57,930 --> 02:16:59,639
That specific text, I happened to know

3558
02:16:59,639 --> 02:17:01,200
since I had to go through it forensically

3559
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:03,870
during my deposition in a case I was not named in.

3560
02:17:03,870 --> 02:17:05,670
I had nothing to do with whatsoever.

3561
02:17:06,930 --> 02:17:10,950
It's crazy how civil suits can like be used

3562
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:12,600
to hurt people you disagree with politically.

3563
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:16,770
But I was mad at a very specific,

3564
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:17,952
I mean really what that...

3565
02:17:17,952 --> 02:17:18,786
I mean, you're asking me,

3566
02:17:18,786 --> 02:17:20,940
I'll tell you exactly what that was.

3567
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:23,760
It was the second the election ended

3568
02:17:23,760 --> 02:17:24,959
and they stopped voting,

3569
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:26,490
stopped the vote counting on election night.

3570
02:17:26,490 --> 02:17:27,566
I was like, well this is,

3571
02:17:27,566 --> 02:17:29,610
and it's all now mail-in ballots

3572
02:17:29,610 --> 02:17:30,673
and electronic voting machines.

3573
02:17:30,673 --> 02:17:32,700
I was like, that's a rigged election.

3574
02:17:32,700 --> 02:17:34,950
I thought that then, I think it now.

3575
02:17:34,950 --> 02:17:36,299
Now, it's obvious that it was.

3576
02:17:36,299 --> 02:17:38,554
But at the time I was like, I feel like there's,

3577
02:17:38,554 --> 02:17:40,440
that was like crazy what just happened.

3578
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:41,969
I want, but I don't wanna go on TV

3579
02:17:41,969 --> 02:17:43,080
and say that's a rigged election

3580
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:44,790
because I don't have any evidence as a recollection.

3581
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:45,629
You can't do that.

3582
02:17:45,629 --> 02:17:48,120
It's irresponsible and it's wrong.

3583
02:17:48,120 --> 02:17:50,010
So I was like, I want...

3584
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:51,809
The Trump campaign was making all these claims

3585
02:17:51,809 --> 02:17:54,150
about this or that fraud,

3586
02:17:54,150 --> 02:17:58,290
so I was trying my best to substantiate them,

3587
02:17:58,290 --> 02:17:59,123
to follow up on it.

3588
02:17:59,123 --> 02:18:00,840
Everyone else was like, "Shut up, Trump, you lost.

3589
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:04,320
Go away. We're gonna indict you."

3590
02:18:04,320 --> 02:18:05,587
But I felt like my job was to be like,

3591
02:18:05,587 --> 02:18:06,930
"No, the guy's, he's president,

3592
02:18:06,930 --> 02:18:08,700
he's claiming the election just got stolen

3593
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:09,690
and he's making these claims.

3594
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:10,740
Let's see if we can."

3595
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:14,340
Well, the people around him were like so incompetent.

3596
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:15,629
It was just absolutely crazy.

3597
02:18:15,629 --> 02:18:17,383
And so, I called a couple of times.

3598
02:18:17,383 --> 02:18:19,740
I finally give up, but I'd call him be like,

3599
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:22,139
all right, you guys claim that these inconsistencies

3600
02:18:22,139 --> 02:18:24,059
and this, you know, whatever this happened,

3601
02:18:24,059 --> 02:18:26,309
gimme evidence and I'll put it on TV.

3602
02:18:26,309 --> 02:18:27,959
It's my job to bring stuff

3603
02:18:27,959 --> 02:18:30,709
that is not gonna be aired anywhere else to the public.

3604
02:18:32,070 --> 02:18:34,650
I couldn't, it was like, it was insane

3605
02:18:34,650 --> 02:18:37,049
how incompetent and unserious.

3606
02:18:37,049 --> 02:18:38,670
- So, they weren't able to provide like-

3607
02:18:38,670 --> 02:18:41,420
- Well, here's the point of the story and of that text.

3608
02:18:42,299 --> 02:18:44,520
So then they come out and they say, well, dead people voted.

3609
02:18:44,520 --> 02:18:46,049
Well, that's just an easy call.

3610
02:18:46,049 --> 02:18:49,290
Okay, if a dead person voted, we can prove someone's dead,

3611
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:51,150
'cause like being dead is one of the few things

3612
02:18:51,150 --> 02:18:52,950
we're good at like verifying,

3613
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:54,600
'cause you start to smell, okay?

3614
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:56,162
And there's a record of it.

3615
02:18:56,162 --> 02:18:57,510
It's called a death certificate.

3616
02:18:57,510 --> 02:18:59,910
So it was like, gimme the names of people who are dead,

3617
02:18:59,910 --> 02:19:01,980
who voted, and then we can get their registration

3618
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:03,690
and we can show they voted.

3619
02:19:03,690 --> 02:19:05,100
Five names.

3620
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:07,817
So I go on TV and I say this,

3621
02:19:07,817 --> 02:19:12,817
Caroline Johnson, 79 of Waukegan, Illinois voted,

3622
02:19:12,870 --> 02:19:15,424
here's her death certificate, she died.

3623
02:19:15,424 --> 02:19:16,257
And the campaign sends me this stuff.

3624
02:19:16,257 --> 02:19:18,719
Now I in general don't take stuff directly

3625
02:19:18,719 --> 02:19:20,639
from campaigns 'cause they all lie

3626
02:19:20,639 --> 02:19:22,320
'cause their job is to get elected or whatever.

3627
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:24,330
So, I'm very wary of campaigns

3628
02:19:24,330 --> 02:19:25,610
having been around it for 30 years.

3629
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:28,830
So like, but I made an exception to my rule

3630
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:30,299
and I got a bunch of stuff from them.

3631
02:19:30,299 --> 02:19:33,150
Well, like of the six names, two of 'em were still alive.

3632
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:35,400
What?

3633
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:37,950
I was so, well, I immediately corrected it the next night.

3634
02:19:37,950 --> 02:19:39,120
CNN did a whole segment

3635
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,730
on how I was spreading disinformation,

3636
02:19:41,730 --> 02:19:43,440
which I was by the way.

3637
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:45,480
In this one case they were right.

3638
02:19:45,480 --> 02:19:47,223
I was so mad.

3639
02:19:48,360 --> 02:19:50,940
I was like, "I hate you.

3640
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:53,097
I'm not talking about you, I'm so mad."

3641
02:19:54,300 --> 02:19:56,430
Anyway, that's the answer if that's what that was.

3642
02:19:56,430 --> 02:19:57,480
- Who were you texting to?

3643
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:58,918
- My producer.

3644
02:19:58,918 --> 02:19:59,751
And I was like, venting.

3645
02:19:59,751 --> 02:20:00,900
It's like a producer I was really close to.

3646
02:20:00,900 --> 02:20:03,060
And I've known him for a long time.

3647
02:20:03,060 --> 02:20:03,893
He's really smart.

3648
02:20:03,893 --> 02:20:07,104
And he's like, he was someone I could like be honest with.

3649
02:20:07,104 --> 02:20:08,706
And I was like, "Rah."

3650
02:20:08,706 --> 02:20:09,780
And by the way, it was so funny.

3651
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:11,768
I mean now I'm doing what was me,

3652
02:20:11,768 --> 02:20:12,601
which I will keep to a minimum,

3653
02:20:12,601 --> 02:20:14,973
but it's like stealing someone's text.

3654
02:20:16,050 --> 02:20:18,570
And by the way, I was an idiot.

3655
02:20:18,570 --> 02:20:20,010
I should have said, come and arrest me.

3656
02:20:20,010 --> 02:20:21,630
I'm not giving you my freaking text messages,

3657
02:20:21,630 --> 02:20:22,800
okay? - [Lex] Yeah.

3658
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:25,353
- But I got bullied into it by a lawyer.

3659
02:20:26,523 --> 02:20:27,673
I didn't get bullied into it.

3660
02:20:27,673 --> 02:20:29,400
I was weak enough to agree with a lawyer.

3661
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:30,720
It was my fault.

3662
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:31,920
Never should have done that.

3663
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:34,140
Fuck you, they're my texts.

3664
02:20:34,140 --> 02:20:35,370
I'm not even named in this case.

3665
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:37,740
That's what I should have said, but I didn't.

3666
02:20:37,740 --> 02:20:39,420
I said I was mad on the air the next day,

3667
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:41,523
but not in language that colorful.

3668
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:45,424
But whatever, whatever.

3669
02:20:45,424 --> 02:20:49,518
I try to be transparent.

3670
02:20:49,518 --> 02:20:50,430
I mean, I also think, by the way,

3671
02:20:50,430 --> 02:20:52,653
if you watch someone over time,

3672
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:55,620
you don't always know what they really think,

3673
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:57,720
but you can tell if someone's lying.

3674
02:20:57,720 --> 02:20:59,763
You can sort of feel it in people.

3675
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,160
And I have lied.

3676
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:03,270
I'm sure I'll lie again.

3677
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:04,933
I don't wanna lie.

3678
02:21:04,933 --> 02:21:05,940
I don't think I'm a liar.

3679
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:07,020
I try not to be a liar.

3680
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:08,430
I don't wanna be a liar.

3681
02:21:08,430 --> 02:21:11,433
I think it's like really important not to be a liar.

3682
02:21:12,720 --> 02:21:14,520
- You said nice things about me earlier.

3683
02:21:14,520 --> 02:21:16,200
I'm starting to question.

3684
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:17,370
I have questions. (Tucker laughing)

3685
02:21:17,370 --> 02:21:18,493
I have a lot of questions, Tucker.

3686
02:21:18,493 --> 02:21:21,153
- I hate Lex Fridman. (laughs)

3687
02:21:21,153 --> 02:21:24,574
- Yeah, I am gonna have to see your texts after this.

3688
02:21:24,574 --> 02:21:25,830
- My texts are so uninteresting now.

3689
02:21:25,830 --> 02:21:28,290
It's like crazy how uninteresting they are.

3690
02:21:28,290 --> 02:21:29,250
- [Lex] Emojis and gifs.

3691
02:21:29,250 --> 02:21:30,540
- Yeah, lots of dog pictures.

3692
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:31,710
- Nice.

3693
02:21:31,710 --> 02:21:35,357
You said some degree the election was rigged.

3694
02:21:36,761 --> 02:21:37,697
Was it stolen?

3695
02:21:37,697 --> 02:21:39,360
- It was a hundred percent stolen.

3696
02:21:39,360 --> 02:21:40,864
Are you joking?

3697
02:21:40,864 --> 02:21:42,000
- [Lex] Like it was rigged to that large of a degree.

3698
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:46,380
- Yeah, they completely change the way people vote

3699
02:21:46,380 --> 02:21:48,150
right before the election on the basis of COVID,

3700
02:21:48,150 --> 02:21:49,230
which had nothing to do with-

3701
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:50,580
- In that way it was rigged,

3702
02:21:50,580 --> 02:21:52,797
meaning like manipulated. - 100%.

3703
02:21:52,797 --> 02:21:55,620
And you censor the information people are allowed to get.

3704
02:21:55,620 --> 02:21:58,530
Anyone who complains about COVID,

3705
02:21:58,530 --> 02:22:02,070
which is like, by the way, it might have hurt Trump.

3706
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:04,461
But I mean it's like whatever.

3707
02:22:04,461 --> 02:22:06,240
I mean you could play it many different ways.

3708
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:10,140
You can't have censorship in a democracy by definition.

3709
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:11,430
Here's how it works.

3710
02:22:11,430 --> 02:22:12,660
The people rule.

3711
02:22:12,660 --> 02:22:15,210
They vote for representatives to carry their agenda

3712
02:22:15,210 --> 02:22:17,130
to the capital city and get it enacted.

3713
02:22:17,130 --> 02:22:18,836
That's how they're in charge.

3714
02:22:18,836 --> 02:22:19,669
And then every few years

3715
02:22:19,669 --> 02:22:20,550
they get to reassess the performance

3716
02:22:20,550 --> 02:22:23,040
of those people in an election.

3717
02:22:23,040 --> 02:22:27,510
In order to do that, they need access,

3718
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:30,690
unfettered access to information.

3719
02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:32,880
And no one, particularly not people

3720
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:35,610
who are already in power is allowed to tell them

3721
02:22:35,610 --> 02:22:36,810
what information they can have.

3722
02:22:36,810 --> 02:22:39,480
They have to have all information that they want.

3723
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:42,000
Whether the people in charge want it or don't want it

3724
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,880
or think it's true or think it's false, it doesn't matter.

3725
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:46,740
And the second you don't have that,

3726
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:47,730
you don't have a democracy.

3727
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:49,507
It's not a free election, period.

3728
02:22:49,507 --> 02:22:52,740
And that's very clear in other countries, I guess.

3729
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:53,760
But it's not clear here.

3730
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:57,240
So, but I would say it's this election that,

3731
02:22:59,718 --> 02:23:00,930
I mean it took me a while to come to this,

3732
02:23:00,930 --> 02:23:04,320
but it's this election that's the referendum on democracy.

3733
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:06,180
Biden is senile.

3734
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:07,380
He's literally senile.

3735
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:09,660
He can't talk, he can't walk.

3736
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:10,740
The whole world knows that.

3737
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:12,930
Leave our borders, people are, you know,

3738
02:23:12,930 --> 02:23:14,643
everybody in the world knows it.

3739
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:21,353
A senile man is not gonna get elected

3740
02:23:21,353 --> 02:23:24,951
in the most powerful country in the world

3741
02:23:24,951 --> 02:23:27,540
unless there's fraud, period.

3742
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:30,120
Like who would vote for a senile man?

3743
02:23:30,120 --> 02:23:31,410
He literally can't talk.

3744
02:23:31,410 --> 02:23:33,030
And nobody I've ever met

3745
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:35,490
thinks he's running the US government 'cause he's not.

3746
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:38,640
And so I think the world is looking on

3747
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,380
at this coming election and saying,

3748
02:23:40,380 --> 02:23:42,300
and a lot of the world hates Trump.

3749
02:23:42,300 --> 02:23:45,150
Okay, it's not an endorsement of Trump, but it's just true.

3750
02:23:45,150 --> 02:23:50,150
If Joe Biden gets reelected, democracy's a freaking joke.

3751
02:23:51,330 --> 02:23:52,350
It's just true.

3752
02:23:52,350 --> 02:23:56,400
- I think half the country doesn't think he's senile,

3753
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:57,957
just thinks he's speaking-

3754
02:23:57,957 --> 02:23:59,220
- Do you really think that?

3755
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:00,540
They don't think he's senile?

3756
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:05,540
- Yeah, I think he just has difficulty speaking.

3757
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:06,383
It's like-

3758
02:24:06,383 --> 02:24:07,710
- [Tucker] Why do they think he has difficulty speaking?

3759
02:24:07,710 --> 02:24:10,830
- Like gradual degradation, just getting old.

3760
02:24:10,830 --> 02:24:12,510
So, cognitive ability is a degrading.

3761
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:14,190
- What's the difference between degraded

3762
02:24:14,190 --> 02:24:16,320
cognitive ability and senility?

3763
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:20,100
- Well, senility has a threshold of like a,

3764
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:21,330
it's beyond a threshold

3765
02:24:21,330 --> 02:24:23,220
to where he could be a functioning leader.

3766
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:24,660
- Okay, okay, that may be a term of art

3767
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:25,493
that I don't fully understand

3768
02:24:25,493 --> 02:24:27,870
and maybe there's like an IQ threshold or something,

3769
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:32,220
but I'm happy to go with degraded cognitive ability.

3770
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:33,870
- Sure, but that's an age thing.

3771
02:24:33,870 --> 02:24:35,520
- But he's the leader of the United States

3772
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:37,710
with the world's second largest nuclear arsenal.

3773
02:24:37,710 --> 02:24:38,543
- And I'm with you.

3774
02:24:38,543 --> 02:24:40,740
I'm a sucker for great speeches

3775
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:42,767
and for speaking abilities of leaders

3776
02:24:42,767 --> 02:24:47,670
and Biden with two wars going on and potentially more,

3777
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:50,850
the importance of a leader to speak eloquently,

3778
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:52,890
both privately in a room with other leaders

3779
02:24:52,890 --> 02:24:54,600
and publicly is really important.

3780
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:58,175
- I agree with you that rhetorical ability really matters.

3781
02:24:58,175 --> 02:24:59,400
Convincing people if that your program is right,

3782
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:02,580
telling them what we're for, national identity,

3783
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:04,230
national unity, all come from words.

3784
02:25:04,230 --> 02:25:05,910
I agree with all of that.

3785
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:07,830
But at this stage, even someone

3786
02:25:07,830 --> 02:25:10,740
who grunted at the microphone would be more reassuring

3787
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:13,710
that a guy who clearly doesn't know where he is.

3788
02:25:13,710 --> 02:25:15,720
And I think everyone knows that.

3789
02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:18,390
And like, I can't imagine there's an honest person

3790
02:25:18,390 --> 02:25:19,830
in Washington which is gonna vote for Biden

3791
02:25:19,830 --> 02:25:22,230
by 90% obviously, 'cause they're all dependent

3792
02:25:22,230 --> 02:25:23,910
on the federal government for their income.

3793
02:25:23,910 --> 02:25:27,330
But is there any person who could say like,

3794
02:25:27,330 --> 02:25:29,280
out of 350 million Americans,

3795
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:30,690
like that's the most qualified to lead,

3796
02:25:30,690 --> 02:25:33,990
or even in the top 80%, like what?

3797
02:25:33,990 --> 02:25:37,710
That's so embarrassing that that guy is our president.

3798
02:25:37,710 --> 02:25:40,920
And with wars going on, it's scary.

3799
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:42,780
- But it's complicated to understand

3800
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:46,591
why those are the choices we have.

3801
02:25:46,591 --> 02:25:47,424
- Well, I agree.

3802
02:25:47,424 --> 02:25:48,390
Well, it's a failure of the system.

3803
02:25:48,390 --> 02:25:49,410
Clearly it's not working.

3804
02:25:49,410 --> 02:25:51,990
If you've got one guy over 80, the guy,

3805
02:25:51,990 --> 02:25:53,499
other guy almost at 80,

3806
02:25:53,499 --> 02:25:56,460
like people that he should not be running any.

3807
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:58,170
- So why you have on the democratic side,

3808
02:25:58,170 --> 02:26:01,170
you have Dean Phillips, you have RFK Jr.

3809
02:26:01,170 --> 02:26:03,270
until recently, I guess he's independent.

3810
02:26:03,270 --> 02:26:06,090
And then you have Vivek who are all younger people.

3811
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:06,923
- [Tucker] Yeah.

3812
02:26:06,923 --> 02:26:11,620
- Why did they not connect to a degree to where people-

3813
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:12,453
- It's such an interesting,

3814
02:26:12,453 --> 02:26:14,460
I mean I think it's a really interesting,

3815
02:26:14,460 --> 02:26:16,860
there are a million different answers.

3816
02:26:16,860 --> 02:26:19,264
And of course I don't fully understand it

3817
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:22,020
even though I feel like I've watched it pretty carefully.

3818
02:26:22,020 --> 02:26:25,380
But I would say the bottom line

3819
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:30,380
is there's so much money vested in the federal apparatus,

3820
02:26:31,440 --> 02:26:33,690
in the parties, in the government.

3821
02:26:33,690 --> 02:26:35,184
As I said a minute ago,

3822
02:26:35,184 --> 02:26:37,860
our economies dominated by monopolies,

3823
02:26:37,860 --> 02:26:40,384
but the greatest all monopolies is the federal monopoly

3824
02:26:40,384 --> 02:26:43,650
which oversees and controls all the other monopolies.

3825
02:26:43,650 --> 02:26:47,160
So it's like, it's really substantially about the money.

3826
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:48,930
It's not ideological, it's about the money.

3827
02:26:48,930 --> 02:26:51,930
And if someone controls the federal government,

3828
02:26:51,930 --> 02:26:53,940
I mean at this point it's the most powerful

3829
02:26:53,940 --> 02:26:55,230
organization in human history.

3830
02:26:55,230 --> 02:26:59,490
Like, it's kind of hard to fight that.

3831
02:26:59,490 --> 02:27:02,340
And in the case of Trump, I know the answer there.

3832
02:27:02,340 --> 02:27:03,630
They raided Mar-a-Lago,

3833
02:27:03,630 --> 02:27:05,790
they indicted him on bullshit charges.

3834
02:27:05,790 --> 02:27:07,740
Like, and I felt that in myself too.

3835
02:27:07,740 --> 02:27:09,930
Even I was like, come on, come on.

3836
02:27:09,930 --> 02:27:11,097
Like whatever you think of Trump.

3837
02:27:11,097 --> 02:27:13,257
And I agreed with his immigration views

3838
02:27:13,257 --> 02:27:15,030
and I really liked Trump personally.

3839
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:18,273
I think he's hilarious and interesting, which he is.

3840
02:27:19,170 --> 02:27:20,719
But it's like, okay,

3841
02:27:20,719 --> 02:27:22,133
there are a lot of people in this country.

3842
02:27:23,670 --> 02:27:25,770
At very least like let's have a real debate.

3843
02:27:25,770 --> 02:27:27,180
The second...

3844
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:28,020
Messed up your cameras there,

3845
02:27:28,020 --> 02:27:29,400
sorry, I'm getting excited.

3846
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:34,400
But the second they rated Mar-a-Lago on a documents charge

3847
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:37,290
as someone from DC I was like,

3848
02:27:37,290 --> 02:27:39,060
I know a lot about classification

3849
02:27:39,060 --> 02:27:41,430
and all that stuff and been around it a lot.

3850
02:27:41,430 --> 02:27:45,810
That's so absurd that I was like, now it's not about Trump,

3851
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:48,360
it's about our system continuing.

3852
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:50,760
Like if you can take out a presidential candidate

3853
02:27:50,760 --> 02:27:52,950
on a fake charge, use the justice system

3854
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:54,840
to take the guy outta the race,

3855
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:57,870
then we don't have a representative democracy anymore.

3856
02:27:57,870 --> 02:28:01,800
And I think a lot of Republican voters felt that way.

3857
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:03,150
If they hadn't indicted him,

3858
02:28:03,150 --> 02:28:04,740
I'm not sure he would be the nominee.

3859
02:28:04,740 --> 02:28:05,850
I really don't think he would be.

3860
02:28:05,850 --> 02:28:07,770
- So, now a vote for Trump is a kind of

3861
02:28:07,770 --> 02:28:09,750
fuck you to the system

3862
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:12,030
- Or an expression of your desire

3863
02:28:12,030 --> 02:28:14,160
to keep the system that we had.

3864
02:28:14,160 --> 02:28:15,750
Which is one where voters get to decide.

3865
02:28:15,750 --> 02:28:16,890
Prosecutors don't get to decide.

3866
02:28:16,890 --> 02:28:18,660
Look, they told us for four years

3867
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:22,120
that Trump was like a super criminal or something.

3868
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:24,360
I've actually been friends with some super criminals.

3869
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:25,770
I'm a little less judgey than most.

3870
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:28,140
So I didn't discount the possibility

3871
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:29,680
that he had, I don't know.

3872
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:31,110
He is in the real estate business

3873
02:28:31,110 --> 02:28:32,280
in New York in the 70s.

3874
02:28:32,280 --> 02:28:33,540
Like, did he kill someone?

3875
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:35,490
I don't know. - [Lex] Yeah.

3876
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:38,070
- No, I'm not joking and I'm not for killing people,

3877
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:40,237
but like anything's possible.

3878
02:28:40,237 --> 02:28:41,734
- It's good that you took a stand on that.

3879
02:28:41,734 --> 02:28:42,983
(Tucker laughing)

3880
02:28:42,983 --> 02:28:44,627
- Yeah, no, I'm not joking. - [Lex] Yeah.

3881
02:28:44,627 --> 02:28:45,790
- I was like, well who knows, you know,

3882
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:47,340
and I didn't know. - [Lex] Yeah, real estate.

3883
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:49,500
- And what they came up with was a documents charge.

3884
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:51,000
Are you joking?

3885
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,050
And then the sitting president

3886
02:28:52,050 --> 02:28:54,210
has the same documents violation, but he's fine.

3887
02:28:54,210 --> 02:28:56,520
It's like, it's crazy this is happening

3888
02:28:56,520 --> 02:28:57,390
in front of all of us.

3889
02:28:57,390 --> 02:28:59,520
And then it becomes like at that point,

3890
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:03,060
it's not about Joe Biden, it's not about Donald Trump.

3891
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:04,530
It's about preserving a system

3892
02:29:04,530 --> 02:29:06,966
which has worked not perfectly,

3893
02:29:06,966 --> 02:29:09,510
but pretty freaking well for 250 years.

3894
02:29:09,510 --> 02:29:11,250
I know you don't like Trump. I get it.

3895
02:29:11,250 --> 02:29:12,840
Let's not destroy that system.

3896
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,790
Like we can handle in the four years of Trump.

3897
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:16,770
I think we can, so I'll calm down.

3898
02:29:16,770 --> 02:29:20,455
What we can't handle is a country whose political system

3899
02:29:20,455 --> 02:29:22,680
is run by the Justice Department.

3900
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:25,140
Like that is just,

3901
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:28,680
you're freaking Ecuador at that point, no.

3902
02:29:28,680 --> 02:29:30,930
- So speaking of the Justice department,

3903
02:29:30,930 --> 02:29:34,228
CIA and intelligence agencies of that nature,

3904
02:29:34,228 --> 02:29:38,250
which you've been traveling quite a bit,

3905
02:29:38,250 --> 02:29:39,660
probably tracked by everybody,

3906
02:29:39,660 --> 02:29:43,383
which is the most powerful intelligence agency do you think?

3907
02:29:44,767 --> 02:29:48,120
CIA, Mossad, MI6, SVR.

3908
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:54,213
I can keep going.

3909
02:29:55,184 --> 02:29:56,820
(chuckles) The Chinese.

3910
02:29:56,820 --> 02:29:58,770
- It depends what you mean by powerful.

3911
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:04,350
Which one bats above its weight we know,

3912
02:30:04,350 --> 02:30:06,270
which one is-

3913
02:30:06,270 --> 02:30:07,630
- Mossad just to be clear, I guess is what you-

3914
02:30:07,630 --> 02:30:10,260
- Well, of course, tiny country,

3915
02:30:10,260 --> 02:30:12,120
very sophisticated intel service.

3916
02:30:12,120 --> 02:30:16,380
Which one has the greatest global reach in comms?

3917
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:18,540
Which one is most able to read your text?

3918
02:30:18,540 --> 02:30:22,113
I assume the NSA, but Chinese are clearly pretty good.

3919
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:24,900
Israel's pretty good.

3920
02:30:24,900 --> 02:30:27,720
The French actually are surprisingly good

3921
02:30:27,720 --> 02:30:29,160
for kind of a declining country.

3922
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:30,900
Their intel services are pretty, seem pretty impressive.

3923
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:35,340
No, I love France, but you know what I mean, and all that.

3924
02:30:35,340 --> 02:30:36,647
So but the question,

3925
02:30:36,647 --> 02:30:38,310
I mean I grew up around all that stuff.

3926
02:30:38,310 --> 02:30:39,660
That's all totally fine.

3927
02:30:39,660 --> 02:30:41,970
Like a strong country should have a strong

3928
02:30:41,970 --> 02:30:44,430
and capable intel service, so its policy makers

3929
02:30:44,430 --> 02:30:45,450
can make informed decisions.

3930
02:30:45,450 --> 02:30:47,250
Like that's what they're for.

3931
02:30:47,250 --> 02:30:49,795
As Vladimir Putin himself noted.

3932
02:30:49,795 --> 02:30:50,850
And I don't talk about it very much, but it's true.

3933
02:30:50,850 --> 02:30:52,560
I applied to the CIA when I was in college

3934
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:55,440
'cause I was familiar with it

3935
02:30:55,440 --> 02:30:58,170
because of where I lived and had grown up and everything.

3936
02:30:58,170 --> 02:30:59,850
And I was like, seemed interesting.

3937
02:30:59,850 --> 02:31:02,122
That's honestly the only reason.

3938
02:31:02,122 --> 02:31:03,870
I was like live in foreign countries, see history happen.

3939
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:05,160
Like I'm for that.

3940
02:31:05,160 --> 02:31:06,600
I applied to the operations directorate,

3941
02:31:06,600 --> 02:31:10,503
they turned me down on the basis of drug use actually.

3942
02:31:11,730 --> 02:31:12,563
True.

3943
02:31:12,563 --> 02:31:14,310
But anyhow, whatever, I was unsuited for it,

3944
02:31:14,310 --> 02:31:15,540
so I'm glad they turned me down.

3945
02:31:15,540 --> 02:31:19,291
But the point is I didn't see CIA as a threat,

3946
02:31:19,291 --> 02:31:21,540
partly because I was bathing in propaganda about CIA

3947
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:22,740
and I didn't really understand what it was

3948
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,150
and didn't want to know.

3949
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:26,010
But second, because my impression at the time

3950
02:31:26,010 --> 02:31:27,960
was it was outwardly focused.

3951
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:29,613
It was focused on our enemies.

3952
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:34,020
I don't have a problem with that as much.

3953
02:31:34,020 --> 02:31:36,690
The fact that CIA is playing in domestic politics

3954
02:31:36,690 --> 02:31:38,190
and actually has for a long time,

3955
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:39,750
was involved in the Kennedy assassination.

3956
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:42,123
That's not speculation, that's a fact.

3957
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:44,520
And I confirmed that from someone

3958
02:31:44,520 --> 02:31:46,853
who had read their documents that are still not public.

3959
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:48,720
It's shocking.

3960
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:50,307
Like you can't have that.

3961
02:31:50,307 --> 02:31:52,830
And the reason I'm so mad is I really believe

3962
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:54,840
in the idea of representative government

3963
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:56,130
acknowledging its imperfections,

3964
02:31:56,130 --> 02:31:58,200
but like I should have some say, I live here,

3965
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:01,680
I'm a citizen, I pay all your freaking taxes.

3966
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:06,240
So the fact that they would be tampering

3967
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:10,237
with American democracy is so outrageous to me.

3968
02:32:10,237 --> 02:32:12,630
And I don't know why, "Morning Joe" is not outraged.

3969
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:16,170
This parade of dummies, highly credentialed dummies

3970
02:32:16,170 --> 02:32:18,030
they have on, "Morning Joe" every day.

3971
02:32:18,030 --> 02:32:20,250
They don't seem to, that doesn't bother them at all.

3972
02:32:20,250 --> 02:32:21,420
How could that not bother you?

3973
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:24,163
Why is only Glenn Greenwald mad about it?

3974
02:32:24,163 --> 02:32:27,210
I mean, it's confirmed it's not like a fever dream,

3975
02:32:27,210 --> 02:32:28,170
it's real.

3976
02:32:28,170 --> 02:32:31,410
They played in the last election domestically.

3977
02:32:31,410 --> 02:32:33,120
And I guess it shows how dumb I am

3978
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,470
because they've been doing that for many years.

3979
02:32:37,170 --> 02:32:40,851
I mean, the guy who took out Mossadegh lived on my street.

3980
02:32:40,851 --> 02:32:42,270
One of the Roosevelt, CIA officer.

3981
02:32:42,270 --> 02:32:44,570
So I mean, again, I grew up around this stuff,

3982
02:32:47,333 --> 02:32:49,800
but I never really thought,

3983
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:51,450
I never reached the obvious conclusion,

3984
02:32:51,450 --> 02:32:54,540
which is that if the US government

3985
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:57,270
subverts democracy in other countries

3986
02:32:57,270 --> 02:32:59,640
in the name of democracy, it will over time

3987
02:32:59,640 --> 02:33:01,650
subvert democracy in my country.

3988
02:33:01,650 --> 02:33:02,483
Why wouldn't it?

3989
02:33:03,650 --> 02:33:05,940
The corruption is like core.

3990
02:33:05,940 --> 02:33:07,890
It's at the root of it.

3991
02:33:07,890 --> 02:33:09,780
The purpose of the CIA was envisioned,

3992
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:11,280
at least publicly envisioned

3993
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,530
as an intel gathering apparatus for the executive,

3994
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:15,480
so the president could make wise foreign policy decisions.

3995
02:33:15,480 --> 02:33:18,150
What the hell is happening in Country X? I don't know.

3996
02:33:18,150 --> 02:33:20,790
Let me call the agency in charge of finding out.

3997
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:23,850
The point wasn't to freaking guarantee

3998
02:33:23,850 --> 02:33:25,413
the outcome of elections.

3999
02:33:27,930 --> 02:33:30,240
- I'm doing a Israel-Palestine debate next week.

4000
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:33,510
But I have to ask you just your thoughts,

4001
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:35,250
maybe even from a US perspective,

4002
02:33:35,250 --> 02:33:37,890
what do you think about Hamas attacks on Israel?

4003
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:41,520
What would be the right thing for Israel to do

4004
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,890
and what's the right thing for US to do in this

4005
02:33:43,890 --> 02:33:46,813
if you looking at the geopolitics of it.

4006
02:33:46,813 --> 02:33:50,520
- I mean, it's not a topic that I get into a lot

4007
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:51,843
because I'm a non-expert.

4008
02:33:53,220 --> 02:33:57,120
And because I'm not, unlike every other American,

4009
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:00,600
I'm not emotionally invested in other countries,

4010
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:01,433
just in general.

4011
02:34:01,433 --> 02:34:04,830
I mean I admire them or not and I love visiting them.

4012
02:34:04,830 --> 02:34:07,680
I love Jerusalem, probably my favorite city in the world.

4013
02:34:08,970 --> 02:34:10,800
But I don't have an emotional attachment to it.

4014
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:12,930
So maybe I've got more clarity.

4015
02:34:12,930 --> 02:34:14,130
I don't know, maybe less.

4016
02:34:14,130 --> 02:34:15,330
Here's my view.

4017
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:17,520
I believe in sovereignty as mentioned.

4018
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:21,390
And I think each country has to make decisions

4019
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:22,470
based on its own interest,

4020
02:34:22,470 --> 02:34:24,712
but also with reference to its own capabilities

4021
02:34:24,712 --> 02:34:26,880
and its own long-term interest.

4022
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:31,740
And it's very unwise for, I'm not a huge fan of treaties.

4023
02:34:31,740 --> 02:34:34,200
Some are fine, too many bad,

4024
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:37,714
but I think US aid, military aid to Israel

4025
02:34:37,714 --> 02:34:40,860
and the implied security guarantees some explicit,

4026
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:43,080
but many implied security guarantees of the United States

4027
02:34:43,080 --> 02:34:45,150
to Israel probably haven't helped Israel

4028
02:34:45,150 --> 02:34:47,071
that much long term.

4029
02:34:47,071 --> 02:34:49,828
It's a rich country with a highly capable population.

4030
02:34:49,828 --> 02:34:51,240
Like every other country,

4031
02:34:51,240 --> 02:34:53,100
it's probably best if it makes its decisions

4032
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:55,503
based on what it can do by itself.

4033
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:01,230
So I would definitely be concerned if I lived in Israel

4034
02:35:01,230 --> 02:35:04,290
because I think fair or unfair,

4035
02:35:04,290 --> 02:35:06,060
and really this is another product of technology,

4036
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:07,620
social media.

4037
02:35:07,620 --> 02:35:10,500
Public sentiment in that area is boiling over.

4038
02:35:10,500 --> 02:35:12,020
And I think it's gonna be hard for some

4039
02:35:12,020 --> 02:35:15,360
of the governments in the region, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey,

4040
02:35:15,360 --> 02:35:16,830
to contain their own.

4041
02:35:16,830 --> 02:35:18,840
They don't want conflict with Israel at all.

4042
02:35:18,840 --> 02:35:20,490
They were all pretty psyched actually

4043
02:35:20,490 --> 02:35:22,620
for the trend in progress.

4044
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:24,720
The Saudi peace deal, which was never signed,

4045
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:26,310
but would've been great for everybody,

4046
02:35:26,310 --> 02:35:29,730
'cause like trade peace, normal relations,

4047
02:35:29,730 --> 02:35:32,040
like that's good, okay, let's just say.

4048
02:35:32,040 --> 02:35:34,540
I know John Bolton doesn't like it, but it's good.

4049
02:35:35,490 --> 02:35:39,153
And it's kind of what we should be looking for.

4050
02:35:40,375 --> 02:35:42,330
But now it's not possible.

4051
02:35:42,330 --> 02:35:46,680
And if you had like a coalition of countries against Israel,

4052
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:48,180
I know Israel's nuclear weapons

4053
02:35:48,180 --> 02:35:50,577
and has a capable military and all that

4054
02:35:50,577 --> 02:35:51,960
and the backing of the United States,

4055
02:35:51,960 --> 02:35:54,030
but like you don't, it's a small country,

4056
02:35:54,030 --> 02:35:55,893
I think I'd be very worried.

4057
02:35:57,480 --> 02:35:58,800
So, there's that.

4058
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:03,800
And I don't see any advantage in to the United States.

4059
02:36:04,463 --> 02:36:08,550
I mean, I think it's important for each country

4060
02:36:08,550 --> 02:36:10,505
to make its own decisions.

4061
02:36:10,505 --> 02:36:11,338
- But it also is a place, like you said,

4062
02:36:11,338 --> 02:36:13,980
where things are boiling over

4063
02:36:13,980 --> 02:36:17,070
and it could spread across multiple nations

4064
02:36:17,070 --> 02:36:18,540
into a major military conflict.

4065
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:20,730
- Yeah, well I think very easily could happen.

4066
02:36:20,730 --> 02:36:23,130
In fact, probably right after Ramadan, if I had to guess.

4067
02:36:23,130 --> 02:36:25,680
And yeah, I pray it doesn't.

4068
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:30,180
But again, I don't think you can overstate

4069
02:36:30,180 --> 02:36:33,540
the lack of wisdom, weakness, short-term thinking

4070
02:36:33,540 --> 02:36:36,450
of American foreign policy leadership.

4071
02:36:36,450 --> 02:36:38,970
These are the architects of the Iraq war,

4072
02:36:38,970 --> 02:36:42,150
of the totally pointless destruction of Libya,

4073
02:36:42,150 --> 02:36:44,280
totally pointless destruction of Syria

4074
02:36:44,280 --> 02:36:46,320
and the 20 year occupation of Afghanistan

4075
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:48,270
that resulted in a return to the status quo.

4076
02:36:48,270 --> 02:36:53,270
So like their, of the Vietnam War, their track record

4077
02:36:53,400 --> 02:36:55,980
of the Korean War, even going back 80 years

4078
02:36:55,980 --> 02:36:59,790
is uninterrupted failures one after the other.

4079
02:36:59,790 --> 02:37:04,790
So I just don't have any confidence in those leaders,

4080
02:37:05,490 --> 02:37:08,790
when was the last time they improved another country?

4081
02:37:08,790 --> 02:37:10,990
Can you think of the, oh, the Marshall plan.

4082
02:37:12,060 --> 02:37:13,773
Well, you look at Europe now and you're like,

4083
02:37:13,773 --> 02:37:16,350
"I don't know if that worked."

4084
02:37:16,350 --> 02:37:18,930
But even if it did work, again 80 years ago,

4085
02:37:18,930 --> 02:37:20,580
so when was the last country

4086
02:37:20,580 --> 02:37:23,670
American foreign policy makers improved?

4087
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:25,070
So if I were...

4088
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:27,870
Netanyahu's in a very difficult place,

4089
02:37:27,870 --> 02:37:30,226
politically impossible I mean.

4090
02:37:30,226 --> 02:37:31,920
I'm glad I'm not Netanyahu.

4091
02:37:31,920 --> 02:37:33,420
And I'm not sure he's capable

4092
02:37:33,420 --> 02:37:36,180
of making wise long-term decisions anyway.

4093
02:37:36,180 --> 02:37:39,480
But if I was just like an Israeli, I'd be like,

4094
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:44,043
I don't know if I want like all this help and guidance.

4095
02:37:45,960 --> 02:37:47,310
So yeah, I actually think it's worse

4096
02:37:47,310 --> 02:37:49,680
than just having just returned from the Middle East

4097
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:51,990
and talking to a lot of pretty open-minded,

4098
02:37:51,990 --> 02:37:56,990
sort of pro-Israeli Arabs who want stability above all.

4099
02:37:57,780 --> 02:38:00,330
The merchant class always wants stability,

4100
02:38:00,330 --> 02:38:01,830
so I'm on their side, I guess.

4101
02:38:03,571 --> 02:38:04,746
And they're like,

4102
02:38:04,746 --> 02:38:06,780
"Man, this could get super ugly super fast."

4103
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:09,300
American leadership is completely absent.

4104
02:38:09,300 --> 02:38:10,290
It's all posturing.

4105
02:38:10,290 --> 02:38:12,900
It's like people like Nikki Haley.

4106
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:15,570
You just wonder like how does an advanced civilization

4107
02:38:15,570 --> 02:38:18,420
promote someone like Nikki Haley to a position of authority?

4108
02:38:18,420 --> 02:38:20,110
It's like what?

4109
02:38:20,110 --> 02:38:23,190
Shh, shh, like adults are talking, adults are talking.

4110
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:25,050
Nikki Haley, please go away.

4111
02:38:25,050 --> 02:38:26,970
Like that would be the appropriate response.

4112
02:38:26,970 --> 02:38:28,440
But everyone's so intimidated to be like,

4113
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:29,880
oh, she's a strong woman.

4114
02:38:29,880 --> 02:38:33,810
She's so transparently weak and sort of ridiculous

4115
02:38:33,810 --> 02:38:35,550
and doesn't know anything and is just like,

4116
02:38:35,550 --> 02:38:37,260
thinks that jumping up and down

4117
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,210
and making these absurd blanket statements,

4118
02:38:39,210 --> 02:38:42,007
repeating bumper stickers is like leadership,

4119
02:38:42,007 --> 02:38:46,440
so it's like a self-confident advanced society

4120
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:50,280
would never allow Nikki Haley to advance.

4121
02:38:50,280 --> 02:38:53,340
I mean, she's really not impressive, sorry.

4122
02:38:53,340 --> 02:38:56,160
- I just feel like you hold back too much

4123
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:58,588
and don't tell us what you really think.

4124
02:38:58,588 --> 02:39:00,203
- (laughs) Sorry.

4125
02:39:00,203 --> 02:39:01,170
- I think you just speak your mind more often.

4126
02:39:01,170 --> 02:39:02,855
- Well, by the way, these are not,

4127
02:39:02,855 --> 02:39:05,580
I mean you can completely disagree with my opinions,

4128
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:06,600
but in the case of Nikki Haley,

4129
02:39:06,600 --> 02:39:07,980
it's not like an opinion formed

4130
02:39:07,980 --> 02:39:09,990
just from watching television, which I don't watch.

4131
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:12,570
It's an opinion formed from knowing Nikki Haley.

4132
02:39:12,570 --> 02:39:15,510
- So, strong words from Tucker.

4133
02:39:15,510 --> 02:39:18,780
- Well felt too. (chuckles) (Lex chuckling)

4134
02:39:18,780 --> 02:39:20,100
Well the world's in the balance.

4135
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:20,933
I mean it's not just-

4136
02:39:20,933 --> 02:39:22,565
- [Lex] Yes, this is important stuff.

4137
02:39:22,565 --> 02:39:23,729
- Yeah, it's not just like, well, you know,

4138
02:39:23,729 --> 02:39:25,620
what should the capital gains rate be?

4139
02:39:25,620 --> 02:39:27,930
It's like, do we live or die?

4140
02:39:27,930 --> 02:39:30,570
I don't know, let's consult Nikki Haley. (laughs)

4141
02:39:30,570 --> 02:39:32,490
So if you're asking should we live or die

4142
02:39:32,490 --> 02:39:33,870
in consulting Nikki Haley,

4143
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:35,760
clearly you don't care about the lives of your children.

4144
02:39:35,760 --> 02:39:37,260
That's how I feel.

4145
02:39:37,260 --> 02:39:39,570
- Not to try to get a preview or anything,

4146
02:39:39,570 --> 02:39:44,490
but do you have interest of interviewing Xi Jinping?

4147
02:39:44,490 --> 02:39:47,583
And if you do, how will you approach that?

4148
02:39:48,587 --> 02:39:51,270
- I have enormous interest in doing that, enormous.

4149
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:53,918
And a couple other people, and we're working on it.

4150
02:39:53,918 --> 02:39:57,330
- Yeah, I should also say like, it's been refreshing

4151
02:39:57,330 --> 02:39:59,280
you interviewing world leaders.

4152
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:03,300
I think when I've started seeing you do that,

4153
02:40:03,300 --> 02:40:06,150
it made me realize how much that's lacking.

4154
02:40:06,150 --> 02:40:07,800
- Well, yeah, it's just interesting, I mean-

4155
02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:10,200
- From even a historical perspective is interesting,

4156
02:40:10,200 --> 02:40:13,110
but it's also important from a geopolitics perspective.

4157
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:15,120
- Well, it's really changed my perspective

4158
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:17,280
and I've been going on about how American I am.

4159
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:18,840
And I think that's a great thing.

4160
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:20,010
I love America.

4161
02:40:20,010 --> 02:40:23,910
But it's also we're so physically geographically isolated

4162
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:24,743
from the world.

4163
02:40:24,743 --> 02:40:27,389
Even though I traveled a ton as a kid a lot

4164
02:40:27,389 --> 02:40:29,310
more than most people.

4165
02:40:29,310 --> 02:40:32,343
But even now I'm like, I'm so parochial.

4166
02:40:33,864 --> 02:40:37,530
I see everything through this lens and getting out

4167
02:40:37,530 --> 02:40:38,730
and seeing the rest of the world

4168
02:40:38,730 --> 02:40:39,990
to which we really are connected,

4169
02:40:39,990 --> 02:40:43,470
like that's real is vitally important.

4170
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:46,347
So, yeah, I mean at this stage

4171
02:40:46,347 --> 02:40:49,200
I don't kind of need to do it,

4172
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:52,740
but I really want to just motivated by curiosity

4173
02:40:52,740 --> 02:40:56,730
and trying to expand my own mind and not be close-minded

4174
02:40:56,730 --> 02:41:00,060
and really see the fullest perspective I possibly can

4175
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:02,280
in order to render wise judgments.

4176
02:41:02,280 --> 02:41:04,530
I mean that's like the whole journey of life.

4177
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:08,973
- I was just hanging out with Rogan yesterday, Joe Rogan,

4178
02:41:10,473 --> 02:41:13,920
and I mentioned to him that it's me being a fan of his show,

4179
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:16,560
that I would love for him to talk with you.

4180
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:19,770
And he said he's up for it.

4181
02:41:19,770 --> 02:41:22,080
Any reason you guys haven't done it already?

4182
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:23,583
- I don't know, I would.

4183
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:26,880
I've only met Rogan once and I liked him.

4184
02:41:26,880 --> 02:41:30,690
I met him at the UFC in New York.

4185
02:41:30,690 --> 02:41:34,203
He was with somebody, a mutual friend of ours.

4186
02:41:35,058 --> 02:41:36,780
And Rogan changed media.

4187
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:39,570
I mean maybe more than anybody.

4188
02:41:39,570 --> 02:41:40,403
And he did it.

4189
02:41:40,403 --> 02:41:42,270
What I love about what I admire about Rogan

4190
02:41:42,270 --> 02:41:44,963
without knowing him, beyond meeting him that one time,

4191
02:41:46,802 --> 02:41:49,110
I mean, I'm still in media, but I've always been in media,

4192
02:41:49,110 --> 02:41:50,910
it's like not a great surprise.

4193
02:41:50,910 --> 02:41:52,980
I'm doing what I've always done, just a different format.

4194
02:41:52,980 --> 02:41:57,980
But Rogan, like he's got one of those resumes that I admire.

4195
02:41:58,050 --> 02:41:59,790
I like the guy who was like, I was a longshoreman,

4196
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:01,950
I was a short order cook, I was an astrophysicist.

4197
02:42:01,950 --> 02:42:04,938
I mean, he was like, he used a man of parts.

4198
02:42:04,938 --> 02:42:08,250
And this guy was a fighter, a standup comic,

4199
02:42:08,250 --> 02:42:10,710
he hosted some, "Fear Factor."

4200
02:42:10,710 --> 02:42:14,400
Like how did he wind up at the vanguard

4201
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:18,420
of like the deepest conversations in the country?

4202
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:19,320
Like how did that happen?

4203
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:23,013
So, I definitely respect that and I think it's cool.

4204
02:42:24,945 --> 02:42:26,210
And he, Rogan is one of those people

4205
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:27,150
who just kind of came out of nowhere.

4206
02:42:27,150 --> 02:42:29,970
Like no one helped him, you know what I mean?

4207
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:32,886
- And he was doing the thing that he loves doing

4208
02:42:32,886 --> 02:42:34,541
and it somehow keeps accidentally

4209
02:42:34,541 --> 02:42:36,840
being exceptionally successful.

4210
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:37,890
- Yeah, and he's curious.

4211
02:42:37,890 --> 02:42:40,684
So, that's like the main thing.

4212
02:42:40,684 --> 02:42:42,690
And there was a guy without getting boring,

4213
02:42:42,690 --> 02:42:44,883
but there was a guy I worked with years ago

4214
02:42:44,883 --> 02:42:47,280
who like kind of dominated cable news, Larry King,

4215
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:48,300
and everyone would always beat up

4216
02:42:48,300 --> 02:42:49,500
on Larry King for being dumb.

4217
02:42:49,500 --> 02:42:50,940
Well, I got to know Larry King well,

4218
02:42:50,940 --> 02:42:52,350
and I was his fill-in host for a while,

4219
02:42:52,350 --> 02:42:54,510
and Larry King was just intensely curious.

4220
02:42:54,510 --> 02:42:56,550
He'd be like, "Why do you wear a black tie, Lex?"

4221
02:42:56,550 --> 02:42:57,383
I'd be like, "Because I like black tie."

4222
02:42:57,383 --> 02:42:58,410
"Why do you like a black tie?"

4223
02:42:58,410 --> 02:42:59,700
No one, everyone else wears a stripe type.

4224
02:42:59,700 --> 02:43:00,533
You wear a black one, why?

4225
02:43:00,533 --> 02:43:01,770
And he would like, he was like really interested.

4226
02:43:01,770 --> 02:43:02,700
- [Lex] Yeah, genuinely so,

4227
02:43:02,700 --> 02:43:03,633
yeah. - Totally.

4228
02:43:04,650 --> 02:43:07,020
And I want to be like that.

4229
02:43:07,020 --> 02:43:09,420
I don't want to think I know everything.

4230
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:11,250
That's so boorish and also false.

4231
02:43:11,250 --> 02:43:12,210
You don't know everything.

4232
02:43:12,210 --> 02:43:13,980
But I see that in Rogan.

4233
02:43:13,980 --> 02:43:15,450
Rogan's like, "Rah, how does that work?"

4234
02:43:15,450 --> 02:43:17,580
And people will, and it's so funny

4235
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:20,133
how that's threatening to people.

4236
02:43:20,970 --> 02:43:23,520
It's like Rogan will just sit there while someone else

4237
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:26,010
is free balling on some far out topic,

4238
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:28,380
which by the way might be true,

4239
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:30,030
probably true than the conventional explanation.

4240
02:43:30,030 --> 02:43:33,180
People are like, I don't know, how can he stand that?

4241
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:34,740
He had someone say the pyramids

4242
02:43:34,740 --> 02:43:36,570
weren't built 3,000 years ago,

4243
02:43:36,570 --> 02:43:38,100
but 8,000 years ago, and that's wrong.

4244
02:43:38,100 --> 02:43:39,630
It's like, first of all,

4245
02:43:39,630 --> 02:43:40,980
how do you know when the pyramids were built?

4246
02:43:40,980 --> 02:43:43,740
Second, why do you care if someone disagrees with you?

4247
02:43:43,740 --> 02:43:44,853
Like, what is that?

4248
02:43:45,883 --> 02:43:48,189
This weird kind of like groupthink.

4249
02:43:48,189 --> 02:43:50,670
It's almost like fourth grade,

4250
02:43:50,670 --> 02:43:52,590
there's always like some little girl in the front row

4251
02:43:52,590 --> 02:43:56,790
who's like acting as the kinda the teacher's enforcer,

4252
02:43:56,790 --> 02:43:58,200
like whip around and be like, "Sit down.

4253
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:00,700
Didn't you hear what Mrs. Johnson said, sit down."

4254
02:44:02,144 --> 02:44:04,620
(laughs) That's like the whole American media.

4255
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:06,630
How dare you ask that question.

4256
02:44:06,630 --> 02:44:09,570
And Rogan just seems like completely on his own trip.

4257
02:44:09,570 --> 02:44:10,860
Like he doesn't even hear it.

4258
02:44:10,860 --> 02:44:13,282
He's like, "Well, really when were the pyramids built?"

4259
02:44:13,282 --> 02:44:14,851
And I'm just like, "Oh, I love that."

4260
02:44:14,851 --> 02:44:17,250
- [Lex] Yeah, curiosity, open-mindedness.

4261
02:44:17,250 --> 02:44:18,083
- Yes.

4262
02:44:18,083 --> 02:44:19,830
- The thing I admire about him most honestly,

4263
02:44:19,830 --> 02:44:21,360
is that he's a good father.

4264
02:44:21,360 --> 02:44:22,500
He's a good husband.

4265
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:26,250
He's a good family man for many years.

4266
02:44:26,250 --> 02:44:28,500
And like, that's his place

4267
02:44:28,500 --> 02:44:30,270
where he escapes from the world too.

4268
02:44:30,270 --> 02:44:31,410
And it's just beautiful.

4269
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:33,720
- Without that, man, you're destroyed.

4270
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:35,640
- [Lex] Yeah. - If I had a wife

4271
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:39,300
who was interested at all in any way in what I did,

4272
02:44:39,300 --> 02:44:42,300
I think I would've gone crazy by now.

4273
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:43,470
When we get home, we don't.

4274
02:44:43,470 --> 02:44:44,610
She's like, how was your day?

4275
02:44:44,610 --> 02:44:45,443
It was great.

4276
02:44:45,443 --> 02:44:46,560
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

4277
02:44:46,560 --> 02:44:47,520
That's the end of our conversation

4278
02:44:47,520 --> 02:44:48,930
about what I do for a living.

4279
02:44:48,930 --> 02:44:50,910
And that is such a wonderful

4280
02:44:50,910 --> 02:44:53,070
and essential respite from you said,

4281
02:44:53,070 --> 02:44:55,410
how do I not become an asshole to the extent I haven't,

4282
02:44:55,410 --> 02:45:00,410
I kind of have, but how have I not been transformed

4283
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:03,930
into a totally insufferable megalomaniac

4284
02:45:03,930 --> 02:45:05,850
who like checking his Twitter replies

4285
02:45:05,850 --> 02:45:07,980
every day or every minute.

4286
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:09,420
It's that, yeah, you gotta have,

4287
02:45:09,420 --> 02:45:12,900
the core of your life has to be solid and enduring

4288
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:14,910
and not just ephemeral and silly.

4289
02:45:14,910 --> 02:45:16,560
- So, the two of you have known each other

4290
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:17,910
for what, 40 years?

4291
02:45:17,910 --> 02:45:19,620
- We've been together 40 years.

4292
02:45:19,620 --> 02:45:20,910
- [Lex] Together 40 years. - 40 years.

4293
02:45:20,910 --> 02:45:22,023
Yeah, 1984.

4294
02:45:23,515 --> 02:45:25,650
He was the hottest 15-year-old in Newport, Rhode Island.

4295
02:45:25,650 --> 02:45:27,240
- Wow. - [Tucker] Sounds dirty.

4296
02:45:27,240 --> 02:45:28,680
But I'm talking about myself.

4297
02:45:28,680 --> 02:45:30,605
I was the hottest person. (laughs)

4298
02:45:30,605 --> 02:45:32,400
- Yeah, you were just looking in the mirror.

4299
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:33,233
- [Tucker] Yeah. - Very nice.

4300
02:45:33,233 --> 02:45:35,760
So, what's the secret to a successful relationship,

4301
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:37,143
successful marriage?

4302
02:45:38,130 --> 02:45:39,570
- I don't even know.

4303
02:45:39,570 --> 02:45:43,740
I mean, no, I'm serious. - [Lex] Yeah.

4304
02:45:43,740 --> 02:45:46,679
- I got married in August '91, so that's,

4305
02:45:46,679 --> 02:45:48,090
well, it's our 33rd year of being married fall.

4306
02:45:48,090 --> 02:45:49,140
- At the collapse of the Soviet Union.

4307
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:51,112
- Yeah, yeah, yeah as noted, yeah.

4308
02:45:51,112 --> 02:45:53,070
So, you hear these people,

4309
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:55,410
it's actually changed my theology a little bit.

4310
02:45:55,410 --> 02:45:56,430
Not that I have deep theology,

4311
02:45:56,430 --> 02:46:00,768
but like, I grew up in a society in Southern California

4312
02:46:00,768 --> 02:46:03,060
when I was little, that was like

4313
02:46:03,060 --> 02:46:04,653
a totally self-created society.

4314
02:46:05,550 --> 02:46:07,530
I mean, Southern California was,

4315
02:46:07,530 --> 02:46:09,750
it was the root of libertarianism for a reason.

4316
02:46:09,750 --> 02:46:11,310
It was like, that's where you went to recreate yourself.

4317
02:46:11,310 --> 02:46:14,490
And so, the operative assumption there

4318
02:46:14,490 --> 02:46:16,790
is that you are the sum total of your choices,

4319
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:19,953
and that free will is everything.

4320
02:46:20,820 --> 02:46:23,190
And we never consider questions like,

4321
02:46:23,190 --> 02:46:25,620
well, why do children get cancer?

4322
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:27,295
Like, what do they do to deserve it?

4323
02:46:27,295 --> 02:46:28,950
Well, of course, nothing, right?

4324
02:46:28,950 --> 02:46:30,180
Because that would suggest

4325
02:46:30,180 --> 02:46:31,230
that maybe you're not the sum total.

4326
02:46:31,230 --> 02:46:32,400
Your choices matter.

4327
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:34,380
If I smoke a lot, I get lung cancer.

4328
02:46:34,380 --> 02:46:36,723
If I use fentanyl, I may OD, got it.

4329
02:46:37,801 --> 02:46:39,420
If I don't exercise, I might get fat, okay.

4330
02:46:39,420 --> 02:46:41,250
But like on a bigger scale,

4331
02:46:41,250 --> 02:46:44,880
you're not only the sum total of your choices.

4332
02:46:44,880 --> 02:46:46,080
Like things happen to you

4333
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:47,980
that you didn't deserve, good and bad.

4334
02:46:48,960 --> 02:46:51,741
And marriage is, and I'll speak for myself

4335
02:46:51,741 --> 02:46:54,028
in my case, just one of 'em.

4336
02:46:54,028 --> 02:46:55,350
I mean, I could say, I mean, clearly spending time

4337
02:46:55,350 --> 02:46:56,490
with the person you're married to,

4338
02:46:56,490 --> 02:46:58,713
talking, enjoying each other.

4339
02:46:59,860 --> 02:47:01,560
I have a lot of rituals.

4340
02:47:01,560 --> 02:47:04,110
We have a lot of rituals that ensure that.

4341
02:47:04,110 --> 02:47:06,480
But in 40 years, like you change,

4342
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:08,030
you're like a different person.

4343
02:47:09,422 --> 02:47:12,233
I like did drugs, I was drinking all the time when we met.

4344
02:47:13,470 --> 02:47:15,930
It's been a long time since I've been done that.

4345
02:47:15,930 --> 02:47:17,400
I'm very different and so is she.

4346
02:47:17,400 --> 02:47:18,600
But we're different in ways

4347
02:47:18,600 --> 02:47:20,070
that are complimentary and happy.

4348
02:47:20,070 --> 02:47:20,903
Never been happier.

4349
02:47:20,903 --> 02:47:22,803
So, like how do we pull that off?

4350
02:47:23,670 --> 02:47:25,140
Just kind of good luck, honestly.

4351
02:47:25,140 --> 02:47:26,100
And then I see other people.

4352
02:47:26,100 --> 02:47:27,150
No, I'm not kidding.

4353
02:47:27,150 --> 02:47:28,320
But that's true.

4354
02:47:28,320 --> 02:47:32,790
I think it's so important not to flatter yourself

4355
02:47:32,790 --> 02:47:34,320
if you've been successful at something.

4356
02:47:34,320 --> 02:47:37,410
The thing I've been most successful at is marriage,

4357
02:47:37,410 --> 02:47:40,230
but it's not really me.

4358
02:47:40,230 --> 02:47:41,550
I mean, I haven't-

4359
02:47:41,550 --> 02:47:43,954
- So I think what you indirectly communicating is,

4360
02:47:43,954 --> 02:47:45,210
it's like humility, I think.

4361
02:47:45,210 --> 02:47:47,065
- It's not even humility.

4362
02:47:47,065 --> 02:47:49,590
Humility is the result of a reality based worldview.

4363
02:47:49,590 --> 02:47:50,910
- [Lex] Sure, okay, right, reality.

4364
02:47:50,910 --> 02:47:53,370
- Once you see things clearly,

4365
02:47:53,370 --> 02:47:55,920
then you know that you are not the author

4366
02:47:55,920 --> 02:47:58,710
of all your successes or failures.

4367
02:47:58,710 --> 02:48:03,030
And I hate the implication otherwise

4368
02:48:03,030 --> 02:48:05,280
because it suggests powers that people don't have.

4369
02:48:05,280 --> 02:48:06,360
It's one of the reasons I always hated

4370
02:48:06,360 --> 02:48:08,640
the smoking debate or the COVID debate.

4371
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:10,290
Someone die of COVID, did you not have the vaccine?

4372
02:48:10,290 --> 02:48:12,120
They'd be like, "See, this is what you get.

4373
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:13,980
You smoke cigarettes, you die."

4374
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:14,813
Well, shit I've, you know...

4375
02:48:14,813 --> 02:48:15,646
Yeah, if you smoke cigarettes,

4376
02:48:15,646 --> 02:48:16,956
you more likely to get lung cancer.

4377
02:48:16,956 --> 02:48:18,900
If you don't, if you get, whatever.

4378
02:48:18,900 --> 02:48:19,830
Cause and effect is real.

4379
02:48:19,830 --> 02:48:22,380
I'm not denying its existence, it's obvious.

4380
02:48:22,380 --> 02:48:24,063
But it's not the whole story.

4381
02:48:25,350 --> 02:48:28,770
There are larger forces acting on us, unseen forces.

4382
02:48:28,770 --> 02:48:29,820
That's just a fact.

4383
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:32,010
You don't need to be some kind of religious nut.

4384
02:48:32,010 --> 02:48:33,510
And they act on AI too.

4385
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:35,160
And you should keep that in mind.

4386
02:48:36,262 --> 02:48:37,095
The idea that all-

4387
02:48:37,095 --> 02:48:37,928
- Convincing way you said that.

4388
02:48:37,928 --> 02:48:39,618
- No, it's true.

4389
02:48:39,618 --> 02:48:41,310
It's demonstrably true.

4390
02:48:41,310 --> 02:48:42,143
We're the only society

4391
02:48:42,143 --> 02:48:44,310
that hasn't acknowledged the truth of that.

4392
02:48:44,310 --> 02:48:45,660
And the idea that the only things

4393
02:48:45,660 --> 02:48:46,590
that are real are the things

4394
02:48:46,590 --> 02:48:48,630
that we can see or measure in a lab.

4395
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:51,090
Like that's insane, that's just dumb.

4396
02:48:51,090 --> 02:48:54,240
- In the religious context, you have this two categories

4397
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:57,495
that I really like that of the two kinds of people

4398
02:48:57,495 --> 02:49:01,800
who believe they're God and people who know they're not,

4399
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:06,330
which is a really interesting division

4400
02:49:06,330 --> 02:49:10,740
that speaks to humility and a kind of realist worldview

4401
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:12,780
of where we are in the world.

4402
02:49:12,780 --> 02:49:14,160
- Oh.

4403
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:18,000
- Can atheists being in the latter category?

4404
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:21,630
- No, there are very few atheists

4405
02:49:21,630 --> 02:49:23,550
I've never actually met one.

4406
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:25,593
There are people who pose this atheists,

4407
02:49:27,084 --> 02:49:29,040
but no one's purely rational.

4408
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:31,980
And everyone, I mean, this is a cliche for a reason.

4409
02:49:31,980 --> 02:49:34,920
Everyone under extreme stress appeals to a power

4410
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:37,128
higher than himself because everyone knows

4411
02:49:37,128 --> 02:49:38,940
that there is a power higher than himself.

4412
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:41,310
So really it's just people who are gripped

4413
02:49:41,310 --> 02:49:43,140
with the delusion that they're God.

4414
02:49:43,140 --> 02:49:44,430
No one actually believes that.

4415
02:49:44,430 --> 02:49:46,110
If you're God jump off the roof of your garage

4416
02:49:46,110 --> 02:49:47,370
and see what happens.

4417
02:49:47,370 --> 02:49:48,203
You know what I mean?

4418
02:49:48,203 --> 02:49:50,070
No one actually thinks that,

4419
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:52,233
but people behave as if it's true.

4420
02:49:53,070 --> 02:49:54,780
And those people are dangerous.

4421
02:49:54,780 --> 02:49:57,090
And I will say by contrast, the only people I trust

4422
02:49:57,090 --> 02:49:59,010
are the people who know their limits.

4423
02:49:59,010 --> 02:50:01,660
And I was thinking actually this morning in my sauna.

4424
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:05,220
Of all the people I've interviewed or met,

4425
02:50:05,220 --> 02:50:06,060
this is someone I've never interviewed,

4426
02:50:06,060 --> 02:50:08,210
but I have talked to him a couple of times.

4427
02:50:09,750 --> 02:50:12,870
The greatest leader I've ever met in the world

4428
02:50:12,870 --> 02:50:15,423
is literally a king.

4429
02:50:16,350 --> 02:50:20,670
It's MBZ, Sheikh Mohamed of Abu Dhabi, who is Muslim.

4430
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:22,020
I'm definitely not Muslim.

4431
02:50:22,020 --> 02:50:24,330
I'm Christian, Protestant Christian,

4432
02:50:24,330 --> 02:50:26,430
and so I don't agree with his religion

4433
02:50:26,430 --> 02:50:28,683
and I don't agree with monarchies.

4434
02:50:30,180 --> 02:50:33,300
But he's the best leader in the world that I've ever met.

4435
02:50:33,300 --> 02:50:36,750
And by far it's like not even close.

4436
02:50:36,750 --> 02:50:37,653
And why is that?

4437
02:50:37,653 --> 02:50:39,510
Well there, I could bore you for an hour on the subject,

4438
02:50:39,510 --> 02:50:43,890
but the reason that he's such a good leader

4439
02:50:43,890 --> 02:50:47,220
is because he's guided by an ever present knowledge

4440
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:51,160
of his limitations and of the limits of his power

4441
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:53,490
and of his foresight.

4442
02:50:53,490 --> 02:50:55,860
And when you start there, when you start with reality,

4443
02:50:55,860 --> 02:50:56,700
it's not even humility.

4444
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:57,840
Humility can be opposed.

4445
02:50:57,840 --> 02:50:59,790
Like, oh, I'm so humble.

4446
02:50:59,790 --> 02:51:02,850
Okay, humble brag is a phrase for a reason.

4447
02:51:02,850 --> 02:51:05,441
It's like way deeper than that's just like, no.

4448
02:51:05,441 --> 02:51:07,537
Do I have magical powers?

4449
02:51:07,537 --> 02:51:09,480
Can I see the future?

4450
02:51:09,480 --> 02:51:13,740
No, okay, that's just a fact, so I'm not God.

4451
02:51:13,740 --> 02:51:15,390
But I've never seen anybody

4452
02:51:15,390 --> 02:51:19,560
more at ease with admitting that than MBZ,

4453
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:20,910
just a remarkable person.

4454
02:51:20,910 --> 02:51:24,600
And for that reason, he is like treated as an oracle.

4455
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:28,020
I don't think people understand the number of world leaders

4456
02:51:28,020 --> 02:51:33,020
who trapes through his house or palace to seek his counsel.

4457
02:51:33,240 --> 02:51:38,240
I'm not sure that there is parallel since,

4458
02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:40,440
I don't wanna get too hyperbolic here,

4459
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:42,450
but honestly since like Solomon,

4460
02:51:42,450 --> 02:51:44,610
where people come from like around the world

4461
02:51:44,610 --> 02:51:46,410
to ask what he thinks.

4462
02:51:46,410 --> 02:51:48,110
Now, why would they be doing that?

4463
02:51:49,380 --> 02:51:51,720
Because Abu Dhabi's military is so powerful.

4464
02:51:51,720 --> 02:51:53,010
I mean, he's rich, okay?

4465
02:51:53,010 --> 02:51:54,900
Massive oil and gas deposits.

4466
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:57,813
But like for a lot of, you know, so is Canada.

4467
02:51:58,928 --> 02:51:59,761
You know what I mean?

4468
02:51:59,761 --> 02:52:01,500
And no one is coming to Ottawa

4469
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:03,480
to ask Justin Trudeau what he thinks.

4470
02:52:03,480 --> 02:52:05,100
No, it's humility.

4471
02:52:05,100 --> 02:52:07,380
That's where wisdom comes from.

4472
02:52:07,380 --> 02:52:09,960
You start to think like, I spent my whole life like mad

4473
02:52:09,960 --> 02:52:14,250
at America's leadership class, 'cause it's not just Biden

4474
02:52:14,250 --> 02:52:17,490
or the people in official positions,

4475
02:52:17,490 --> 02:52:19,830
it's the whole constellation of advisors

4476
02:52:19,830 --> 02:52:21,930
and throne sniffers around them.

4477
02:52:21,930 --> 02:52:24,450
And it's not that even that I disagree with them.

4478
02:52:24,450 --> 02:52:25,800
I'm not impressed by them.

4479
02:52:25,800 --> 02:52:27,660
I'm just not impressed.

4480
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:30,320
They're not that capable, right?

4481
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:31,620
So that's what I was saying about Nikki Haley.

4482
02:52:31,620 --> 02:52:32,453
I don't think Nikki Haley's

4483
02:52:32,453 --> 02:52:34,423
the most evil person in the world.

4484
02:52:34,423 --> 02:52:36,060
I think she's ridiculous, obviously.

4485
02:52:36,060 --> 02:52:39,843
And everyone's like, "Oh, Nikki Haley or Mike Pompeo," what?

4486
02:52:40,710 --> 02:52:43,590
- Great leaders are so rare that when you see one,

4487
02:52:43,590 --> 02:52:44,600
you know it right away.

4488
02:52:44,600 --> 02:52:46,423
- It blows your mind.

4489
02:52:46,423 --> 02:52:50,040
And what blows my mind about Sheikh Mohamed in Abu Dhabi

4490
02:52:50,040 --> 02:52:52,770
is that everyone in the world knows it.

4491
02:52:52,770 --> 02:52:54,660
And I've never seen a story on this.

4492
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:56,904
And I'm not guessing, I know this is true

4493
02:52:56,904 --> 02:52:58,650
'cause I've seen it.

4494
02:52:58,650 --> 02:53:00,300
Everyone in the world knows it.

4495
02:53:00,300 --> 02:53:02,460
And so if there's a conflict,

4496
02:53:02,460 --> 02:53:04,470
he's the only person that people call.

4497
02:53:04,470 --> 02:53:07,530
Like everybody calls the same guy.

4498
02:53:07,530 --> 02:53:11,340
And it's like he runs this tiny little country, the UAE,

4499
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:13,380
I mean, he's in Abu Dhabi.

4500
02:53:13,380 --> 02:53:14,213
There are a bunch of Emirates,

4501
02:53:14,213 --> 02:53:15,930
but he's the president of the country, but still.

4502
02:53:15,930 --> 02:53:17,610
And it's got a ton of energy

4503
02:53:17,610 --> 02:53:19,675
and all that wealth and all that.

4504
02:53:19,675 --> 02:53:21,210
And Dubai's got great real estate and restaurants,

4505
02:53:21,210 --> 02:53:23,070
but really it's a tiny little country

4506
02:53:23,070 --> 02:53:26,160
that wasn't even a country 50 years ago.

4507
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:28,110
So, how did that happen?

4508
02:53:28,110 --> 02:53:31,470
Purely on the basis of his humility

4509
02:53:31,470 --> 02:53:33,390
and the wisdom that results from that humility.

4510
02:53:33,390 --> 02:53:34,590
That's it.

4511
02:53:34,590 --> 02:53:36,990
- What advice would you give to young people?

4512
02:53:36,990 --> 02:53:41,580
You got four, you somehow made them into great human beings.

4513
02:53:41,580 --> 02:53:43,530
What advice would you give to people in high school?

4514
02:53:43,530 --> 02:53:46,950
- Have children immediately including in high school, yes.

4515
02:53:46,950 --> 02:53:48,720
I think that, that's all that matters.

4516
02:53:48,720 --> 02:53:53,400
Like in the end, again, these aren't even cliches anymore

4517
02:53:53,400 --> 02:53:54,330
because no one says them.

4518
02:53:54,330 --> 02:53:56,250
But when I was a kid, people always say on your deathbed,

4519
02:53:56,250 --> 02:53:58,400
you never wish you spent more time at work.

4520
02:53:59,550 --> 02:54:00,540
And I mean, everyone said

4521
02:54:00,540 --> 02:54:01,980
that it was like one of these things.

4522
02:54:01,980 --> 02:54:05,010
And now I don't think Google allows you to say that.

4523
02:54:05,010 --> 02:54:05,843
It's like, no, you're gonna wish

4524
02:54:05,843 --> 02:54:08,070
you spent more time at work, get back to your cube.

4525
02:54:08,070 --> 02:54:13,070
But I can't overstate from my vantage how true that is.

4526
02:54:14,310 --> 02:54:19,310
Nothing else matters, but your family.

4527
02:54:19,710 --> 02:54:21,540
And if you have the opportunity,

4528
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:22,740
and a lot of people are being denied

4529
02:54:22,740 --> 02:54:24,390
the opportunity to have children.

4530
02:54:25,650 --> 02:54:27,600
And this messing with the gender rules,

4531
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:29,010
and I'm not even talking about the tranny stuff.

4532
02:54:29,010 --> 02:54:34,010
I mean, feminism has so destroyed people's brains

4533
02:54:34,590 --> 02:54:38,580
and the ability of young people to connect with each other

4534
02:54:38,580 --> 02:54:40,320
and stay together and have fruitful lives.

4535
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:42,960
It's like nothing's been more destructive than that.

4536
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:44,970
It's such a lie, it's so dumb.

4537
02:54:44,970 --> 02:54:46,842
It's counter to human nature.

4538
02:54:46,842 --> 02:54:48,180
And nothing counter to human nature can endure.

4539
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:49,140
It can only cause suffering.

4540
02:54:49,140 --> 02:54:50,820
And that's what it's done.

4541
02:54:50,820 --> 02:54:53,010
But fight that, stop complaining about it.

4542
02:54:53,010 --> 02:54:56,280
Find someone, by the way, everyone gets together

4543
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:57,990
or most people get together on the basis in a free,

4544
02:54:57,990 --> 02:55:00,450
in a Western society where there's no arranged marriages.

4545
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:02,340
They get together on a basis of sexual attraction.

4546
02:55:02,340 --> 02:55:03,173
Totally natural.

4547
02:55:04,200 --> 02:55:07,050
Get off your birth control and have children.

4548
02:55:07,050 --> 02:55:07,980
Oh, I can't afford that.

4549
02:55:07,980 --> 02:55:09,120
Well, yeah, you'll figure out a way

4550
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:11,280
to afford it once you have kids.

4551
02:55:11,280 --> 02:55:14,640
It's like it's chicken in the egg, but it's actually not.

4552
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:17,250
When you have responsibility, when you have no choice.

4553
02:55:17,250 --> 02:55:18,510
This is true of men.

4554
02:55:18,510 --> 02:55:19,954
I'm not sure of true of women,

4555
02:55:19,954 --> 02:55:20,787
but it's definitely true of men.

4556
02:55:20,787 --> 02:55:23,580
You will not achieve until you have no choice.

4557
02:55:23,580 --> 02:55:25,500
As I always think of men,

4558
02:55:25,500 --> 02:55:28,530
men do nothing until they have to.

4559
02:55:28,530 --> 02:55:30,990
But once they have to, they will do anything.

4560
02:55:30,990 --> 02:55:32,100
That is true.

4561
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:33,870
Men will do nothing unless they have to.

4562
02:55:33,870 --> 02:55:35,250
But once they have to, they will do anything.

4563
02:55:35,250 --> 02:55:37,890
I really believe that from watching and from being one.

4564
02:55:37,890 --> 02:55:40,530
And I would never have done anything if I didn't have to,

4565
02:55:40,530 --> 02:55:43,221
but I had to and I would just recommend it.

4566
02:55:43,221 --> 02:55:44,160
But by the way, even if you don't succeed,

4567
02:55:44,160 --> 02:55:45,360
and even if you're poor.

4568
02:55:46,530 --> 02:55:48,060
Having spent my life among rich people,

4569
02:55:48,060 --> 02:55:49,614
I grew up among rich people.

4570
02:55:49,614 --> 02:55:50,760
I am a rich person.

4571
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:52,260
Boy, are they unhappy.

4572
02:55:52,260 --> 02:55:54,210
Well, that's clearly not the road to happiness.

4573
02:55:54,210 --> 02:55:56,040
You don't want to be a debt slave

4574
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:57,480
or starved to death or anything like that.

4575
02:55:57,480 --> 02:56:00,600
But like making a billion dollars, that's not worth doing.

4576
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:01,590
Don't do that.

4577
02:56:01,590 --> 02:56:03,480
Don't even try to do that.

4578
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:05,820
If you create something that's beautiful and worth having

4579
02:56:05,820 --> 02:56:08,280
and you make a billion dollars, okay,

4580
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:09,420
then you have to deal with your billion dollars,

4581
02:56:09,420 --> 02:56:11,580
which will be the worst part of your life, trust me.

4582
02:56:11,580 --> 02:56:16,580
But seeking money for its own sake is a dead end.

4583
02:56:16,607 --> 02:56:19,050
What you should seek for its own sake is children.

4584
02:56:19,050 --> 02:56:20,190
Talk about a creative act.

4585
02:56:20,190 --> 02:56:22,140
Last thing I'll say the whole point of life

4586
02:56:22,140 --> 02:56:24,390
is to create, okay?

4587
02:56:24,390 --> 02:56:27,900
The act of creation, which is like dying in the west,

4588
02:56:27,900 --> 02:56:31,740
in the arts and in its most pure expression,

4589
02:56:31,740 --> 02:56:33,201
which is children.

4590
02:56:33,201 --> 02:56:35,640
That's all that's worth doing while you're alive

4591
02:56:35,640 --> 02:56:37,830
is creating something beautiful.

4592
02:56:37,830 --> 02:56:39,930
And creating children, by the way, it's super fun.

4593
02:56:39,930 --> 02:56:41,429
It's not hard.

4594
02:56:41,429 --> 02:56:42,510
I can get more technical off the air if you want.

4595
02:56:42,510 --> 02:56:43,560
- [Lex] Yeah, please.

4596
02:56:43,560 --> 02:56:44,393
- I have a lot of thoughts on it.

4597
02:56:44,393 --> 02:56:46,148
- Do you have documents or something?

4598
02:56:46,148 --> 02:56:48,180
- (chuckles) No, I can draw you a schematic.

4599
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:49,050
- [Lex] Oh, thank you.

4600
02:56:49,050 --> 02:56:51,357
- But yeah, that's the greatest thing.

4601
02:56:51,357 --> 02:56:54,030
And the fact that corporate America denies,

4602
02:56:54,030 --> 02:56:55,860
oh, freeze your eggs, have an abortion.

4603
02:56:55,860 --> 02:56:58,290
What? You're evil.

4604
02:56:58,290 --> 02:56:59,123
Are you kidding?

4605
02:56:59,123 --> 02:57:02,040
Because you're taking from people the only thing

4606
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:04,770
that can possibly give them enduring joy.

4607
02:57:04,770 --> 02:57:06,690
And they are successfully taking it from people

4608
02:57:06,690 --> 02:57:07,840
and I hate them for it.

4609
02:57:08,970 --> 02:57:11,340
- You founded, TCN, Tucker Carlson Network.

4610
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:12,283
- [Tucker] Yeah.

4611
02:57:12,283 --> 02:57:13,116
- [Lex] What's your vision for it?

4612
02:57:13,116 --> 02:57:15,780
- [Tucker] I have no vision for myself, for my career,

4613
02:57:15,780 --> 02:57:18,930
and I never have, so I'm like the last person to explain,

4614
02:57:18,930 --> 02:57:20,603
- Just roll with it.

4615
02:57:20,603 --> 02:57:21,900
- Yeah, I'm an instincts guy, a hundred percent.

4616
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:23,700
I have a vision for the world,

4617
02:57:23,700 --> 02:57:25,860
but I don't have a vision for my life, for my career.

4618
02:57:25,860 --> 02:57:30,218
So really my vision extended precisely this far.

4619
02:57:30,218 --> 02:57:31,620
I just want to keep doing what I'm doing.

4620
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:33,030
I just want to keep doing what I'm doing.

4621
02:57:33,030 --> 02:57:35,700
And there was a five hour period

4622
02:57:35,700 --> 02:57:38,100
where I wondered if I would be able to,

4623
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:41,130
'cause I feel pretty spry and like alert

4624
02:57:41,130 --> 02:57:43,860
and I'm certainly deeply enjoying what I'm doing,

4625
02:57:43,860 --> 02:57:45,750
which is talking to people and saying what I think

4626
02:57:45,750 --> 02:57:48,906
and learning, constantly learning,

4627
02:57:48,906 --> 02:57:50,763
but I just wanted to keep doing that.

4628
02:57:52,950 --> 02:57:55,440
And I also wanted to employ the people

4629
02:57:55,440 --> 02:57:58,620
who I worked with at Fox.

4630
02:57:58,620 --> 02:58:00,570
I've worked with the same people for years and I love them.

4631
02:58:00,570 --> 02:58:02,910
And so, I had all these people

4632
02:58:02,910 --> 02:58:03,990
and I wanted to bring them with me.

4633
02:58:03,990 --> 02:58:06,450
So, we had to build a structure for that.

4634
02:58:06,450 --> 02:58:08,220
- But this feels like one of the first times

4635
02:58:08,220 --> 02:58:09,450
you're really working for yourself,

4636
02:58:09,450 --> 02:58:12,150
like there's an extra level of freedom here.

4637
02:58:12,150 --> 02:58:13,590
- Totally, totally.

4638
02:58:13,590 --> 02:58:17,669
And the good, I'm not, you don't want me doing your taxes.

4639
02:58:17,669 --> 02:58:18,502
Like I'm good at some things,

4640
02:58:18,502 --> 02:58:20,010
but I'm really not good at others.

4641
02:58:20,010 --> 02:58:22,455
And more of them would be like running a business,

4642
02:58:22,455 --> 02:58:23,288
like no idea.

4643
02:58:23,288 --> 02:58:24,960
I'm not interested, not a commerce guy,

4644
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:26,160
so I don't buy anything.

4645
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:28,440
So it's like the whole thing I'm not good at.

4646
02:58:28,440 --> 02:58:33,440
But luckily I'm really blessed to have friends

4647
02:58:34,138 --> 02:58:36,420
who are involved in this, who are good at that.

4648
02:58:36,420 --> 02:58:38,670
So I feel positive about it,

4649
02:58:38,670 --> 02:58:43,670
but mostly I'm totally committed to only doing the things

4650
02:58:44,340 --> 02:58:47,610
that I am good at and enjoy and not doing anything else,

4651
02:58:47,610 --> 02:58:49,020
'cause I don't wanna waste my time.

4652
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:51,390
And so I'm just getting to do what I wanna do

4653
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:52,640
and I'm really loving it.

4654
02:58:53,670 --> 02:58:57,330
- What hope, positive hope do you have for the future

4655
02:58:57,330 --> 02:59:01,890
of human civilization in say 50 years, 100 years, 200 years?

4656
02:59:01,890 --> 02:59:04,140
- People are great just by their nature.

4657
02:59:04,140 --> 02:59:07,500
I mean, they're super complicated, but I like people.

4658
02:59:07,500 --> 02:59:09,003
I always have liked people.

4659
02:59:11,010 --> 02:59:12,240
If I was sitting here with Nikki Haley,

4660
02:59:12,240 --> 02:59:13,650
who I guess I've been pretty clear,

4661
02:59:13,650 --> 02:59:15,783
I'm not like a mega fan of Nikki Haley's.

4662
02:59:17,130 --> 02:59:18,976
I would enjoy it.

4663
02:59:18,976 --> 02:59:20,610
I've never met anybody I couldn't enjoy

4664
02:59:20,610 --> 02:59:23,160
on some level given enough time.

4665
02:59:23,160 --> 02:59:28,160
So as long as nobody tampers with the human recipe,

4666
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:32,970
the human nature itself, I will always feel blessed

4667
02:59:32,970 --> 02:59:35,550
by being around other people.

4668
02:59:35,550 --> 02:59:37,290
And that's true around the world.

4669
02:59:37,290 --> 02:59:39,603
Like, I've never been to a country.

4670
02:59:40,876 --> 02:59:42,000
And I've been to scores of countries

4671
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:45,330
where I didn't given a week really like it.

4672
02:59:45,330 --> 02:59:47,010
And like the people.

4673
02:59:47,010 --> 02:59:50,753
So yeah, bad leaders are like a recurring theme

4674
02:59:53,070 --> 02:59:54,908
in human history.

4675
02:59:54,908 --> 02:59:56,070
Like, they're mostly bad.

4676
02:59:56,070 --> 02:59:57,930
And we've got an unusually bad set right now,

4677
02:59:57,930 --> 03:00:00,120
but we'll have better ones at some point.

4678
03:00:00,120 --> 03:00:03,330
I just don't wanna, I don't...

4679
03:00:03,330 --> 03:00:04,710
The one thing I don't like

4680
03:00:04,710 --> 03:00:06,690
more than nuclear weapons and more than AI,

4681
03:00:06,690 --> 03:00:08,520
the one thing that really, really bothers me

4682
03:00:08,520 --> 03:00:10,410
is the idea of using technology

4683
03:00:10,410 --> 03:00:12,310
to change the human brain permanently.

4684
03:00:13,470 --> 03:00:16,230
Because you're tampering with the secret sauce.

4685
03:00:16,230 --> 03:00:20,520
You're tampering with God's creation and totally evil.

4686
03:00:20,520 --> 03:00:22,140
I mean, I literally sat there the other day

4687
03:00:22,140 --> 03:00:25,860
with Klaus Schwab, I was with Klaus Schwab,

4688
03:00:25,860 --> 03:00:28,080
it was like a total moron.

4689
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:29,580
I'm like a hundred years old

4690
03:00:29,580 --> 03:00:31,578
and like has no idea what's going on in the world.

4691
03:00:31,578 --> 03:00:34,260
But he's like one of these guys who, speaking of mediocre,

4692
03:00:34,260 --> 03:00:35,580
everyone's so afraid of Klaus Schwab.

4693
03:00:35,580 --> 03:00:37,710
I don't think Klaus Schwab is gonna be organizing anything.

4694
03:00:37,710 --> 03:00:40,710
Again, he's just like a total figurehead, like a douchebag.

4695
03:00:40,710 --> 03:00:42,750
But anyway, but he was talking

4696
03:00:42,750 --> 03:00:45,180
and he's reading all these talking points,

4697
03:00:45,180 --> 03:00:47,883
like all what the cool kids are talking about at Davos

4698
03:00:47,883 --> 03:00:50,280
and whatever, and he starts talking about it.

4699
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:53,280
In his way and his accent, he was saying,

4700
03:00:53,280 --> 03:00:57,300
I think it's so important that we follow in an ethical way,

4701
03:00:57,300 --> 03:00:59,340
always in an ethical way, of course very ethical.

4702
03:00:59,340 --> 03:01:00,490
I'm a very ethical man.

4703
03:01:01,573 --> 03:01:05,550
That we follow using technology to improve your human mind

4704
03:01:05,550 --> 03:01:07,350
and implant the chips in the brain.

4705
03:01:07,350 --> 03:01:09,227
And I'm like, okay, you have no idea

4706
03:01:09,227 --> 03:01:10,851
what you're talking about.

4707
03:01:10,851 --> 03:01:12,990
You're like as senile as Joe Biden.

4708
03:01:12,990 --> 03:01:14,850
But what was so striking

4709
03:01:14,850 --> 03:01:17,460
is that no one in the room is like, Wait what?

4710
03:01:17,460 --> 03:01:19,260
You're fucking with people's brains.

4711
03:01:20,608 --> 03:01:23,220
(laughs) Like what are you even talking about?"

4712
03:01:23,220 --> 03:01:24,470
Who do you think you are?

4713
03:01:25,980 --> 03:01:28,470
- It's like, I mean, you're right, the secret sauce.

4714
03:01:28,470 --> 03:01:30,300
The human mind is really special.

4715
03:01:30,300 --> 03:01:32,958
Like, we should not mess with it.

4716
03:01:32,958 --> 03:01:37,958
It's all be very careful and whatever special thing it does,

4717
03:01:37,980 --> 03:01:40,800
it seems like it's a good thing.

4718
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:42,507
Like human beings are fundamentally good

4719
03:01:42,507 --> 03:01:46,230
and like these sources of creativity,

4720
03:01:46,230 --> 03:01:48,900
a creative force in the universe we don't wanna mess with.

4721
03:01:48,900 --> 03:01:52,020
- Oh, I mean, what else matters?

4722
03:01:52,020 --> 03:01:53,423
I don't understand.

4723
03:01:53,423 --> 03:01:57,090
I mean, I guess look, I don't wanna seem

4724
03:01:57,090 --> 03:01:59,490
like the Unabomber and I'm not,

4725
03:01:59,490 --> 03:02:00,840
- We are in a cabin in the woods.

4726
03:02:00,840 --> 03:02:03,360
- No, well I'm sympathetic to some of his ideas,

4727
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:04,980
but not of course sending mail bombs to people,

4728
03:02:04,980 --> 03:02:05,920
'cause I like people,

4729
03:02:05,920 --> 03:02:07,830
and I don't believe in violence at all.

4730
03:02:07,830 --> 03:02:12,830
But I think the problem with technology,

4731
03:02:13,230 --> 03:02:14,700
one of the problems with technology

4732
03:02:14,700 --> 03:02:16,110
is the way that people approach it

4733
03:02:16,110 --> 03:02:18,453
in a very kind of mindless, heedless way.

4734
03:02:19,500 --> 03:02:22,140
And I think it's important, this idea that it's inexorable

4735
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:23,340
and we can't control it.

4736
03:02:23,340 --> 03:02:24,690
And if we don't do it, someone else will.

4737
03:02:24,690 --> 03:02:27,000
And there's some truth in that,

4738
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:28,500
but it's not the whole story.

4739
03:02:28,500 --> 03:02:30,720
We do have free will

4740
03:02:30,720 --> 03:02:34,470
and we are creating these things intentionally.

4741
03:02:34,470 --> 03:02:36,060
And I think it's incumbent on us.

4742
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:39,510
It's a requirement of a moral requirement of us

4743
03:02:39,510 --> 03:02:42,660
that we ask like, is this a net gain or a net loss?

4744
03:02:42,660 --> 03:02:44,460
To the extent we can foresee them,

4745
03:02:44,460 --> 03:02:46,706
will the effects be, et cetera, et cetera.

4746
03:02:46,706 --> 03:02:49,231
It's like, it's not super complicated.

4747
03:02:49,231 --> 03:02:51,810
So I just, I prize long-term thinking.

4748
03:02:51,810 --> 03:02:53,820
I don't always apply to my own life, obviously,

4749
03:02:53,820 --> 03:02:57,627
I want to, but I prize it.

4750
03:02:57,627 --> 03:02:59,070
And I think that people with power should think

4751
03:02:59,070 --> 03:03:00,390
about future generations.

4752
03:03:00,390 --> 03:03:01,890
And I don't see that kind of thinking at all.

4753
03:03:01,890 --> 03:03:03,900
They all seem like children to me.

4754
03:03:03,900 --> 03:03:05,850
And like, don't give children handguns

4755
03:03:05,850 --> 03:03:07,530
'cause they can hurt people.

4756
03:03:07,530 --> 03:03:09,570
- Yeah, fundamentally, you want people in power

4757
03:03:09,570 --> 03:03:11,160
to be pro humanity.

4758
03:03:11,160 --> 03:03:12,488
- By the way, you don't want people

4759
03:03:12,488 --> 03:03:13,380
who are 81 who are gonna die anyway.

4760
03:03:13,380 --> 03:03:15,150
Why do they care?

4761
03:03:15,150 --> 03:03:16,710
And by the way, if your track record

4762
03:03:16,710 --> 03:03:18,960
with your own family is miserable,

4763
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:23,100
why would I give you my family to oversee?

4764
03:03:23,100 --> 03:03:23,933
I just don't.

4765
03:03:23,933 --> 03:03:26,310
Like, again, these are artistic level questions

4766
03:03:26,310 --> 03:03:28,229
that someone should answer.

4767
03:03:28,229 --> 03:03:31,890
- Well, thank you for asking those questions first of all,

4768
03:03:31,890 --> 03:03:35,760
and thank you for this conversation.

4769
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:38,550
Thank you for welcoming me to the cabin in the woods.

4770
03:03:38,550 --> 03:03:40,020
- Thank you.

4771
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:41,490
- Thanks for listening to this conversation

4772
03:03:41,490 --> 03:03:42,990
with Tucker Carlson.

4773
03:03:42,990 --> 03:03:44,190

And now let me leave you

4776
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:51,157
with some words from Mahatma Gandhi,

4777
03:03:51,157 --> 03:03:55,110
"When I despair, I remember that all through history,

4778
03:03:55,110 --> 03:03:58,383
the way of truth and love has always won.

4779
03:03:59,250 --> 03:04:01,740
There have been tyrants and murderers

4780
03:04:01,740 --> 03:04:04,560
and for a time they can seem invincible,

4781
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:06,990
but in the end they always fall.

4782
03:04:06,990 --> 03:04:10,110
Think of it, always."

4783
03:04:10,110 --> 03:04:11,160
Thank you for listening,

4784
03:04:11,160 --> 03:04:13,053
and I hope to see you next time.
