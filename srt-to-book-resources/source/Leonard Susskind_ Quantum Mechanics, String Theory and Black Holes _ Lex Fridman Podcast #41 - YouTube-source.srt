00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,970
the following is a conversation with leonard susskind he's a professor of theoretical physics at stanford university

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,679
 and founding director of stanford institute of theoretical physics he's

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,769
 widely regarded as one of the fathers of string theory

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,539
 and in general is one of the greatest physicists of our time both as a researcher

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,670
 and an educator this is the artificial intelligence podcast perhaps

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,570
 you noticed that the people have been speaking with are not just computer scientists

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,800
 but philosophers mathematicians writers psychologists physicists

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,620
 and soon other disciplines to me ai is much bigger than deep learning bigger

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,700
 than computing it is our civilizations journey into understanding

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,930
 the human mind and creating echoes of it in the machine

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,170

14
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,430
 now here's my conversation with leonard susskind

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,530
 you work two more friends with richard fineman house he influenced you changed

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,310
 you as a physicist

17
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,320
 and thinker

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
 what

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,049
 i saw i think what i saw was

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,659
 somebody who could do physics in this deeply intuitive way his

21
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,460
 style was almost a closed his eyes and visualize the phenomena that he was thinking about

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,040
 and through visualization

23
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,740
 i'll flank the mathematical highly mathematical and very very sophisticated technical

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,100
 arguments that people would use i think that was also natural to me but i saw

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,070
 somebody who was actually successful at it who

26
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,909
 could do physics in a way that that i regarded as

27
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,850
 simpler more direct more intuitive

28
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,950
 and while

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,560
 i don't think he changed my way of thinking i do think he validated it he

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,200
 made me look at it and say yeah that's something you

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,630
 can do and get away with practically

32
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,119
 even get away with it

33
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:12,930
 so do you find yourself whether you're thinking about quantum mechanics

34
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:19,110
 or black holes or string theory using intuition as a first step

35
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,510
 or step throughout using visualization

36
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,049
 yeah very much so very much so i tend

37
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:31,500
 not to think about the equations i tend not to think about the symbols i tend to try

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,840
 to visualize the phenomena themselves

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,980
 and then

40
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,700
 when i get an insight that i think is valid i might

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,290
 try to convert it to mathematics

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,829
 but i'm not a math and then a natural mathematician

43
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,260
 or i'm good enough at it i'm

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,010
 good enough at it but i'm not a great mathematician

45
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,190
 so for me the way of thinking about physics is first intuitive first

46
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,170
 visualization

47
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,340
 scribble a few equations maybe

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,690
 but then try to convert it to mathematics

49
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,120
 experiences that other people are better at converting into mathematics

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,160
 and i am

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,010
 and yet you've worked very counterintuitive ideas

52
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,609
 so

53
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,170
 how that's true that's naive is something connor into every their

54
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,099
 rewiring your brain in new ways

55
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,340
 yeah

56
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,419
 quantum mechanics is not intuitive very little of modern physics is intuitive intuitive

57
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:29,579
 or what does intuitive mean it

58
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:36,079
 means the ability to think about it with basic classical physics the physics that that

59
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,579
 we evolved with throwing stones

60
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:45,239
 splashing water or whatever it happens to be quantum

61
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:53,069
 physics general relativity quantum field theory are deeply unintuitive in that way but you know after time

62
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:56,879
 and getting familiar with these things you develop new intuitions

63
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,110
 i always said you rewire

64
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,750
 and

65
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,739
 it's to the point

66
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:02,610
 where me

67
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,040
 and many of my friends find many my friends

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,159
 can think more easily quantum-mechanically

69
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,730
 than we can classically we've gotten so used to it i mean

70
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:19,100
 yes our neural wiring in our brain is such that we understand rocks

71
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,510
 and stones and water and

72
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,430
 so i'm sort of evolved evolved

73
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,620
 for you do you think it's

74
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,229
 possible to create a wiring of neuron

75
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,050
 like state devices that more naturally understand

76
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,240
 quantum mechanics understand wave function understand these weird things

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,330
 well i'm

78
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,960
 not sure i think many of us have evolved

79
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,740
 the ability to think quantum mechanically to some extent

80
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,180
 but that doesn't mean you can think like an electron

81
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,870
 that doesn't mean an another example forget

82
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,090
 for a minute quantum mechanics just

83
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:03,760
 visualizing four dimensional space or five dimensional space or six dimensional space i think we're fundamentally

84
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,970
 wired to visualize three dimensions i can't even visualize two dimensions

85
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,920
 or one dimension without thinking

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,070
 about it as embedded in three dimension in space if

87
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:20,270
 i want to visualize a line i think of the line as being aligned

88
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,970
 in three dimensions right well

89
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,650
 i think of the line as being aligned

90
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,670
 on a piece of paper with a piece of paper being in three dimensions i never

91
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,860
 seem to be able to in some abstract

92
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,770
 and pure way

93
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,840
 visualize in my head the one dimension

94
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
 the two dimension the four dimensions

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,420
 the five dimensions and i don't think that's ever gonna happen

96
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:46,180
 the reason is i think our neural wiring is just set up for that on

97
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,540
 the other hand we do learn ways to think about five

98
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,160
 six seven dimensions and we learn ways we learn mathematical

99
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,280
 ways and we learn ways to visualize them

100
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,050
 but they're different and

101
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,040
 so

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,530
 yeah i think i think we

103
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,620
 do rewire ourselves whether we can ever completely rewire

104
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,780
 ourselves to be completely comfortable with these concepts i doubt

105
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
 so

106
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,000
 that it's completely natural there was a tour it's completely natural so i'm sure there's some

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,830
 what you could argue creatures that live in it two-dimensional

108
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,830
 space

109
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,520
 yeah

110
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,590
 and there are

111
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,360
 and

112
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,800
 um well it's romanticizing

113
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,120
 the notion of course we're all living as far as we know in three-dimensional space but how

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,880
 do you how do those creatures imagine 3d

115
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,900
 space well probably the way we imagined 4d by using some mathematics

116
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,280
 and some equations

117
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,690
 and some some tricks

118
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,690
 okay

119
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,700
 so jumping back to a fireman just for a second

120
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,140
 he had a little bit of an ego

121
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,440
 yes

122
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,780
 what do you think ego is powerful

123
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,200
 or dangerous in science i think

124
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,960
 both both both i

125
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
 think you have to have both arrogance

126
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,560
 and humility you

127
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,200
 have to have the arrogance to say i can

128
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,140
 do this nature is difficult nature

129
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,940
 is very very hard i'm smart enough i can do it i can win

130
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,190
 the battle with nature on the

131
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:24,460
 other hand i think you also have to have the humility to know that

132
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:32,560
 you're very likely to be wrong on any given occasion everything you're thinking could suddenly change

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,500
 young people can come along and say things you won't understand

134
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,370
 and you'll be lost

135
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,950
 and flabbergasted

136
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,950
 so

137
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,480
 i think it's a combination of both you better recognize that

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,050
 you're very limited and you better be

139
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,100
 able to say to yourself

140
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,300
 i'm not so limited

141
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,570
 that i can't win this battle with nature it

142
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,710
 takes a special kind of person who can

143
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,820
 manage both of those i would say and i would say there's echoes of that in

144
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,330
 your own work a little bit of ego a little bit of outside

145
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,450
 of the box humble thinking i hope

146
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:08,930
 so

147
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,470
 so it was their time

148
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,560
 where you

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,520
 complete you felt you looked at yourself and asked am i completely wrong about this

150
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,710
 oh yeah

151
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:27,260
 but the whole thing about specific things the whole thing that way which cold thing me

152
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,950
 and me

153
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,900
 and my ability to do this thing

154
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,380
 oh those

155
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,070
 kinds of doubts those first of all did you have those kinds of doubts no

156
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,820
 i had different kind of doubts i came from a very working-class background

157
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,100
 and i was uncomfortable in academia for

158
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,880
 oh for a long time

159
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,500
 but they weren't doubts about my ability of my

160
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,170
 they were just the discomfort

161
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,950
 and being in an environment that

162
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,540
 my family hadn't participated in

163
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,280
 i know nothing about as a young person

164
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,620
 i didn't learn that there was such a thing called physics

165
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,880
 until i was almost 20 years old

166
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,640
 so i

167
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,750
 did have certain

168
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,140
 kind of doubts but not about my ability i don't

169
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,410
 think i was too worried about whether i would succeed or not i

170
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,410
 never

171
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,150
 i never felt this insecurity am i ever gonna get a job that

172
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,350
 veteran never occurred to me that i wouldn't

173
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,490
 maybe you could speak a little bit to this sense of what is academia for

174
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,100
 because i do feel a bit uncomfortable in it mm-hm

175
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,030
 there's

176
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:43,190
 something i can't put quite into words what you have that's not doesn't

177
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,350
 if we call it music you

178
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,630
 play a different kind of music than a lot of academia

179
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,110
 what

180
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,610
 how have you joined this orchestra

181
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,610
 how

182
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,740
 do you think about it i don't

183
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,730
 know that i thought about it as much as i just felt it yeah

184
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,200
 you know thinking is one thing feeling is another thing i felt like an outsider

185
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:12,730
 until a certain age when i suddenly found myself the ultimate insider in academic physics

186
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,790
 and

187
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,790
 that

188
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,480
 was a sharp transition in the world i wasn't the young man i was probably

189
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,840
 50 years old you were never quite it

190
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,530
 was a phase transition you were never quite free milk in the middle yeah

191
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,900
 that's right i wasn't i always

192
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,140
 felt a little bit of an outsider the beginning a lot

193
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,070
 and outside earth

194
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:42,439
 my way of thinking was different my approach to mathematics was different

195
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,740
 but also

196
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,470
 this my social background that i came from was different

197
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,800
 now these days half the young people i meet their parents were professors my

198
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,860
 that was not my case

199
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,480
 so

200
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
 yeah

201
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,339
 but then all of a sudden at

202
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:06,470
 some point i found myself at they're very much the center of maybe

203
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,730
 not the only one at the center

204
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,110
 but certainly one of the people in the center of a certain kind of physics

205
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,870
 and all that put away i mean i went away in a flash

206
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,089
 so

207
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,649
 maybe maybe a little bit with fineman

208
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,579
 but in general

209
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:23,209
 how

210
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,620
 do you develop ideas do

211
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,249
 you work their ideas alone do you brainstorm with others oh both

212
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:30,670
 both very definitely both

213
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,709
 the earth the younger time i spent more time with myself

214
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,329
 now

215
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,569
 because i'm at stanford because i'm

216
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,089
 because i

217
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,309
 have a lot of ex students

218
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:52,269
 and i you know people who who are interested in the same thing i am i

219
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:57,019
 spend a good deal of time almost on a daily basis interacting

220
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:59,480
 brainstorming as you said it's

221
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,779
 a it's a very important part i spend

222
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,629
 less time probably completely self focused

223
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,899
 and

224
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,550
 the paper and just sitting there staring at it

225
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,029
 what are your hopes for quantum computers

226
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,370
 so

227
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:24,370
 machines that are based on that have some elements of leverage quantum mechanical ideas

228
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,690
 yeah it's not just leveraging quantum mechanical ideas

229
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,910
 you can simulate quantum

230
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,790
 systems on a classical computer simulate

231
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,610
 them means solve the schrodinger equation for them or solve the equations of quantum

232
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,830
 mechanics on a computer

233
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:47,770
 on a classical computer but the classical computer is not doing is not

234
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,120
 a quantum mechanical system itself of course it is that everything is made of quantum mechanics

235
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,260
 but it's not some functioning it's not a functioning as a quantum system it's

236
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,480
 just solving equations the quantum computer is truly a quantum system

237
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,380
 which is actually doing the things that you're

238
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,540
 programming it to do you

239
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,100
 want to program a quantum field theory

240
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,190
 if you

241
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,060
 do it in classical physics that program is not actually

242
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,300
 functioning in the computer as a quantum field theory it's just solving some equations

243
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,300
 physically

244
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,270
 it's not doing the things that that

245
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,040
 the quantum system would do the quantum computer is really a quantum mechanical system

246
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,540
 which is actually carrying out the quantum operations you can measure it at the end it

247
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,640
 intrinsically satisfies the uncertainty principle it is limited

248
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,060
 in the same way that quantum systems are limited by uncertainty

249
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,140
 and so forth and it really is a quantum system that means that

250
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,570
 what you what you're doing when you program something

251
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,300
 for quantum system is they're actually building a real

252
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,360
 version of the system

253
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,470
 the limits of a classical computer classical computers are enormous ly limited when it comes to

254
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,230
 the quantum systems enormously limited

255
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,329
 because you

256
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,370
 probably heard this before but

257
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,670
 in order to store the amount of information that's in a quantum state of

258
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,750
 400 spins

259
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,440
 that's not very many 400 i can put in my path with 400

260
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,980
 pennies in my pocket

261
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,160
 so we'll be able to simulate

262
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,320
 the quantum state of 400

263
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,230
 elementary quantum systems qubits

264
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,760
 we call him to

265
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,800
 do that would take more information

266
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,090
 than can possibly be stored in the entire universe if it were packed

267
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,230
 so tightly that

268
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,230
 you

269
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,050
 couldn't pack anymore in right 400

270
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,660
 cubits on the other hand if your

271
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,970
 quantum computer is composed of four hundred qubits

272
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,660
 it can do everything four hundred qubits can do

273
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,620
 what kind of space

274
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,000
 if you just intuitively

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,490
 think about the space of algorithms that

276
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,500
 that unlocks for us so

277
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,580
 there's a whole complexity theory around classical computers measuring

278
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,890
 the running time of things and pe

279
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,150
 so on what

280
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,880
 kind of algorithm is just intuitively do you think it's you

281
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,680
 know mocks for us okay

282
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,950
 so we know that there are a handful of algorithms

283
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,100
 that can seriously be quantum of classical computers

284
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,200
 and which can have exponentially

285
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,420
 more power and this is a mathematical statement nobody's exhibited this in the laboratory it's

286
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,570
 a mathematical statement we know that's true

287
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,740
 but it also seems more

288
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:43,150
 and more that the number of such things is very limited only very very special

289
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,590
 problems

290
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,210
 exhibit that much advantage for a quantum computer

291
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,220
 others of standard problems to

292
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,270
 my mind as far as i can tell the great power of quantum computers will actually

293
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,140
 be to simulate quantum systems if you're

294
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,180
 interested in a certain quantum system

295
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,460
 and it's too hard to simulate classically

296
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
 you

297
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,590
 simply build a version of the same system

298
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,250
 you build a version of it you build a model of it that's actually functioning

299
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,570
 as the system you

300
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,010
 run it and then

301
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,590
 you do the same thing you would do the quantum system you

302
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,810
 make measurements on it quantum

303
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:26,300
 measurements on it the advantages you can run it much slower you

304
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,540
 could say why bother why not just use the real system and

305
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,480
 why not just do experiments on the real system well

306
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,269
 real systems are kind of limited you can't change them you can't like them

307
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:40,560
 you can't slow them down so that you can poke into them you

308
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,589
 can't modify them an arbitrary kinds of ways to see what would happen if i if

309
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:48,709
 i change the system a little bit

310
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,670
 so i think that quantum computers

311
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,139
 will be extremely valuable in

312
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,459
 in understanding

313
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,470
 quantum systems at the lowest of the fundamental laws they're

314
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,109
 actually satisfying the same laws as the systems that they're simulating that's right okay

315
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:15,559
 so in the one hand you have things like factoring in factoring is the great

316
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,829
 thing of quantum computers factoring large numbers that

317
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,140
 doesn't seem that much to do with quantum mechanics right

318
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,709
 it seems to be almost a fluke

319
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:32,659
 that a quantum computer can solve the factoring problem in a short time

320
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,110
 so though

321
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,440
 and those problems seem to be extremely special rare

322
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,120
 and it's

323
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,720
 not clear to me that there's gonna be a lot of them on

324
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,220
 the other hand there are a lot of quantum systems chemistry there's solid-state

325
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,370
 physics there's material science there's quantum gravity there's all kinds of quantum of quantum field theory

326
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:00,289
 and some of these are actually turning out to be applied sciences as well as very fundamental sciences

327
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,640
 so we

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,860
 probably will run out of the ability to solve equations for these things you

329
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,500
 know solve equations by the standard methods of pencil

330
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,090
 and paper and solve the equations by the method of classical computers

331
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:15,720
 and

332
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,650
 so

333
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,970
 what we'll do is we'll build versions of these systems

334
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,440
 run them and run

335
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,390
 them under controlled circumstances or

336
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,030
 we can change them manipulate them make

337
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,909
 measurements on them and find out all the things we want to know

338
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,860
 so in finding out the things we want to know about

339
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,450
 very small systems right

340
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:42,330
 now the is there something we can also find out about the macro level about

341
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,650
 something about it the function

342
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:46,400
 and forgive me of our brain

343
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,460
 biological systems the the stuff that's about one meter in size versus much much smaller well

344
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,840
 what the only excitement is about among the people that i interact with is understanding

345
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,309
 black holes that falls black holes are big things

346
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:08,789
 there are many many degrees of freedom there is another kind of quantum system that is big it's

347
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,859
 a large quantum computer

348
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:15,070
 and one of the things we learned is that the physics of large quantum

349
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,580
 computers is in some ways similar to the physics of large quantum

350
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,089
 black holes and we're using that relationship

351
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:24,669
 now you asked you didn't ask about quantum computers

352
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:29,320
 or systems you didn't ask about black holes you asked about brains

353
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,179
 yeah i bought stuff that's in the middle of the - it's different

354
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,179
 so

355
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:36,700
 but black holes are there's

356
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,009
 something fundamental about black holes it feels to be very different in the brain

357
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:42,369
 yes

358
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:46,119
 and they also function in a very quantum mechanical way right

359
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,109
 okay

360
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:52,539
 it is first of all unclear to me but of course it's unclear to me i another

361
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,749
 i'm not a a neuroscientist i have

362
00:19:55,749 --> 00:20:00,429
 i don't even have very many friends who are neuroscientists i would

363
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:02,529
 like to have more friends who are neuroscientists

364
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,859
 i just don't run into them very often

365
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,419
 among the few neuroscientists

366
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:16,019
 i've ever talked about about this they are pretty convinced that the brain functions classically

367
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,359
 there is not intrinsically a quantum mechanical system

368
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,190
 or doesn't

369
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,209
 make use of the of the special features entanglement coherent

370
00:20:25,209 --> 00:20:31,749
 superposition are they right i don't know i sort of hope that wrong with just because i like

371
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:34,359
 the romantic idea that the brain is a quantum system

372
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:34,899
 and

373
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,560
 but i think that i think probably not

374
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,800
 the other thing big systems can be composed of lots of little systems

375
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,960
 materials the materials are that we work with and so forth are

376
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,740
 three large systems

377
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,000
 and a large piece of material but they're bagan they're made out of quantum systems

378
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,880
 now one of the things that's been happening over the last a good number of years is with

379
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,320
 discovering materials

380
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,900
 and quantum systems

381
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,920
 which function

382
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,530
 much more quantum mechanically then

383
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:15,130
 than we imagine topological insulators this kind of thing that kind of thing those are macroscopic systems

384
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,670
 but they just superconductors

385
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,230
 superconductors i have

386
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,990
 a lot of quantum mechanics in them you

387
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,880
 can have a large chunk of superconductor

388
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,750
 so it's a big decent material on the other hand it's functioning

389
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,100
 and its properties depend very very strongly on quantum mechanics and to

390
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,510
 analyze them you need the tools of quantum mechanics

391
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,120
 if we can go on to black holes mm-hmm

392
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:47,790
 and looking at the universe as a information processing system as a computer as a giant computer

393
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:52,270
 what's the power of thinking of the universe as an information processing system

394
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:58,770
 but what is perhaps its use besides the mathematical use of discussing black holes

395
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,390
 and your famous debates

396
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,510
 and ideas around that to

397
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,130
 human beings

398
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:12,560
 or life in general as information processing systems well all systems are information processing systems

399
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,330
 you poke them they change a little bit they evolve all systems

400
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:22,760
 or information processes there's no extra magic to us humans it

401
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,420
 certainly feels consciousness intelligence feels like magic sure though where does it emerge from

402
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,890
 if we look at information processing

403
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:40,100
 what are the emergent phenomena that come from viewing the world is an information processing system here

404
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,570
 is what i think my thoughts are not worth much of this if you ask me about physics

405
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,100
 my thoughts may be worth something

406
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,050
 yes if you ask me about this i'm not sure my thoughts are worth anything

407
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:57,470
 but as i said earlier i think when we do introspection when we imagine doing introspection

408
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,680
 and try to figure out what it is when we do and we're thinking i think

409
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,470
 we i think we get it wrong i'm

410
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,340
 pretty sure we get it wrong everything i've heard about the way the brain functions is

411
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,920
 so counterintuitive

412
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,780
 for example you have neurons

413
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,470
 which detect the vertical lines you have different neurons

414
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,760
 which detect lines at 45 degrees you have different neurons i never

415
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,740
 imagined that there were whole circuits

416
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,040
 which were devoted to vertical lines in the brain yeah

417
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,220
 doesn't seem to we where when my brain works my

418
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,680
 brain seems to work put my finger up vertically

419
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,240
 or if i put it horizontally or

420
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,470
 if i put it this way or that way it

421
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,930
 seems to me it's the same the same circuits that are it's not the way it works

422
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,750
 the way the brain is compartmentalized

423
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,760
 seems to be very very different than

424
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,620
 what i would have imagined if i were just doing

425
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,610
 psychological introspection

426
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:56,560
 about how things work my conclusion is that we won't get it right that way but

427
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
 how

428
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,060
 will we get it right i think maybe computer scientists

429
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,260
 will get it right eventually i

430
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,930
 don't think that any ways near it i don't even think they're thinking about it

431
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:10,600
 but by computer eventually we will build machines perhaps

432
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,539
 which are complicated enough

433
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:20,329
 and partly engineered partly evolved maybe evolved by machine learning

434
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:25,759
 and so forth this machine learning is very interesting by machine learning will evolve systems

435
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,699
 and we may start to discover mechanisms that

436
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:34,070
 that have implications for

437
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,139
 how we think and for what what does consciousness thing is all about and

438
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:44,440
 we'll be able to do experiments on them and perhaps answer questions

439
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,949
 that we can't possibly answer by by introspection

440
00:24:48,949 --> 00:24:52,699
 so that's a really interesting point you've in many cases

441
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,369
 if you look even at string theory when

442
00:24:55,369 --> 00:25:00,049
 you first think about a system it seems really complicated like the human brain and through

443
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:02,599
 some basic reasoning then

444
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:06,019
 trying to discover a fundamental low-level

445
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:11,509
 behavior of the system you find out that it's actually much simpler you one have

446
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:16,909
 you you know is that generally the process and to do you have that also hope for biological

447
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,069
 systems as well for all

448
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:21,349
 the kinds of stuff we're studying at the human

449
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:25,969
 level of course physics always begins by trying to find the simplest version of something an analyzer

450
00:25:25,969 --> 00:25:26,809
 yeah

451
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:31,789
 i mean there are lots of examples where physics has taken

452
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:38,269
 very complicated systems analyze them and found simplicity in them for sure i said superconductors

453
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:42,109
 before it's an obvious one a superconductor seems like monstrously complicated

454
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,969
 thing with all sorts of crazy electrical properties magnetic properties

455
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:48,769
 and so forth and when

456
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:51,709
 it finally is boiled down through its simplest

457
00:25:51,709 --> 00:26:00,609
 elements it's a very simple quantum mechanical phenomenon called spontaneous symmetry breaking and

458
00:26:00,609 --> 00:26:06,919
 which we in other context we learned about and we're very familiar with so

459
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:07,729
 yeah i mean

460
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:11,269
 yes we do take complicated things make them simple

461
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,229
 but

462
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:16,369
 what we don't want to do is take things which are intrinsically complicated

463
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:20,749
 and fool ourselves into thinking that we can make them simple we

464
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:21,559
 don't want to make i

465
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:23,629
 don't know who said this but we don't want to make them simpler

466
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:25,009
 than they really are right

467
00:26:25,009 --> 00:26:27,960
 okay is the brain a thing

468
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,940
 which ultimately functions by some simple rules

469
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,320
 or is it just complicated in terms of artificial intelligence

470
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,299
 nobody really knows

471
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,669
 what are the limits of our current approaches you mentioned machine learning

472
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,919
 how do we create human level intelligence it

473
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:49,839
 seems that there's a lot of very smart physicists who perhaps oversimplify

474
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:50,679
 the nature of intelligence

475
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:52,960
 and think of it as information processing

476
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,309
 and therefore

477
00:26:54,309 --> 00:27:01,210
 that it doesn't seem to be any theoretical reason why we can't artificially create a human

478
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:06,419
 level or super human level intelligence in fact the reasoning goes if you create human level intelligence

479
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:10,659
 the same approach you just used to create human level intelligence should

480
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:13,029
 allow you to create superhuman

481
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:15,219
 level intelligence very easily exponentially

482
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:16,149
 so

483
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,059
 what do you think that way of thinking that

484
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,249
 comes from physicists is all

485
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:26,360
 about i wish i knew but there's a particular reason why i wish i knew

486
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,040
 i have a second job i consult

487
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,330
 for google ah not for google for google x i am

488
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:39,200
 the senior academic advisor third to

489
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,880
 a group of machine learning physicists at

490
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,870
 now that sounds crazy because

491
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,870
 i know nothing about the subject i know

492
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,430
 very little about the subject on the other hand i'm good at giving advice so

493
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:56,270
 i give them advice on things anyway i see these young physicists

494
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:58,490
 who are approaching the machine learning problem

495
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,500
 there is a myth there is a real machine learning

496
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,920
 problem mainly why does it work as well as it does it

497
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:09,350
 nobody really seems to understand why it is capable of doing the kind of generalizations

498
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,640
 that it does and so forth

499
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,520
 and

500
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,850
 there are three groups of people who have thought

501
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,740
 about this there are the engineers the engineers are incredibly smart

502
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,790
 but they tend not to think as hard about why the thing is working

503
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,720
 as much as they do how to use it obviously they

504
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,970
 provided a lot of data and it is they who demonstrated that machine learning

505
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,300
 can work much better than you have any right to expect the machine learning

506
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,870
 systems are systems that the system is not too different

507
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:44,990
 than the kind of systems if this is a study there's

508
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,550
 not all that much difference between quantum

509
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,980
 construction of mathematics physically

510
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,330
 yes but in the structure the mathematics between a tension

511
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,720
 network designed to describe a quantum

512
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,240
 system on the one hand and the kind of networks that are used in machine learning

513
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,650
 so

514
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,340
 they're more

515
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,200
 and more i think young

516
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,470
 physicists are being drawn to this field of machine learning some very very good ones i work

517
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,640
 with a number of very good ones not on machine learning but having lunch on having lunch

518
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,840
 yeah

519
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,910
 and i can tell you they are super smart they don't seem to be

520
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,840
 so

521
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,000
 arrogant about their physics backgrounds

522
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,090
 that they think they can do things that nobody else can do

523
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:39,049
 but those physics way of thinking i think will add will

524
00:29:39,049 --> 00:29:42,019
 i had great value to um will

525
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:46,700
 bring value to the machine learning i believe it will and i think it already has

526
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,690
 and

527
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:54,740
 what time scale do you think predicting the future becomes useless in your long experience

528
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:59,080
 and being surprised at new discoveries

529
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,340
 sometimes a day sometimes 20 years there are things

530
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,129
 which i thought

531
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:09,009
 we were very far from understanding

532
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:10,029
 which

533
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:12,259
 practically in a snap of the fingers

534
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,950
 or a blink of the eye suddenly

535
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,590
 became understood completely surprising for me

536
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,250
 there are other things which i looked at and i said we're

537
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,270
 not gonna understand these things for 500 years in particular quantum

538
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,860
 gravity the scale for that was 20 years 25 years and

539
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,170
 we understand a lot and we don't understand it completely now

540
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:37,150
 by any means but we're i thought

541
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,740
 it was 500 years to

542
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,780
 make any progress it

543
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,430
 turned out to be very very far

544
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,340
 from that it turned out to be more like 20 or 25 years from

545
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,490
 the time when i thought it was 500 years

546
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:54,420
 so for me can we jump around quantum gravity some basic ideas in physics

547
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,780
 what is the dream of string theory mathematically

548
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,540
 what is the hope where does it come from what

549
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,790
 problems are trying to solve i don't

550
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,770
 think the dream of string theory is any different

551
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,240
 than the dream of fundamental

552
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,120
 theoretical physics altogether understanding

553
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,280
 a unified theory of everything i

554
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:17,470
 i don't like thinking of string theory as a subject unto itself with

555
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:24,640
 people called string theorists who are the practitioners of this thing called string theory i much

556
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,880
 prefer to think of them as theoretical physicists

557
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:34,390
 trying to answer deep fundamental questions about nature in particular gravity in particular gravity

558
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,720
 and it's connection with quantum mechanics

559
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,840
 and who at the present time find string theory a useful tool rather

560
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,400
 than saying there's a subject

561
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,520
 called string theorists i don't like being referred to as a string theorists

562
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,170
 yes but as a tool is it useful to think about our

563
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:58,750
 nature in multiple dimensions the strings vibrating i believe it is useful

564
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,230
 i'll tell you what the main use of it has been up till now well

565
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,570
 has had a number of main uses originally

566
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:08,380
 string theory was invented then i know there i was there i was right

567
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,190
 at the spot where it was being invented

568
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,190
 literally

569
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,970
 and it was being invented to understand

570
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,530
 hey groans hey drones are sub-nuclear particles protons neutrons mesons

571
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,860
 and

572
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,930
 at

573
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:28,650
 that time the late 60s early seventies it

574
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:35,490
 was clear from experiment that these particles call hydrants had could vibrate could rotate could

575
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,460
 do all the things that a little closed

576
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,910
 string can do and

577
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:43,320
 it was

578
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,050
 and is a valid

579
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,380
 and correct theory of these hydrants it's been experimentally tested

580
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,150
 and that is a done deal it had

581
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:57,270
 a second life as a theory of gravity the same basic

582
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,370
 mathematics except on a very very much smaller distance scale

583
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:07,170
 the objects of gravitation are nineteen

584
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,200
 orders of magnitude smaller than a proton but

585
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,490
 the same mathematics turned up the same mathematics turned up what

586
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:17,910
 has been its value its value is that

587
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,950
 it's mathematically rigorous in many ways and enabled us to to

588
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,820
 find to find mathematical structures

589
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,530
 which have both quantum mechanics

590
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,010
 and gravity with rigor we

591
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,140
 can test out ideas we

592
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,290
 can test out ideas we can't test them in the laboratory that

593
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,660
 nineteen orders of magnitude too small

594
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,930
 or things that were interested in but we can test them out mathematically

595
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,970
 and analyze their internal consistency by

596
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,120
 now

597
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,000
 forty years ago thirty five years ago so forth people

598
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,870
 very very much questioned the consistency between gravity

599
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,190
 and quantum mechanics stephen hawking was very famous for it rightly

600
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,520
 so

601
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:13,320
 now nobody questions that consistency anymore they don't because we have mathematically precise string theories

602
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,629
 which contain both gravity

603
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:18,210
 and quantum mechanics in a consistent way

604
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,699
 so it's provided that

605
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,480
 um that certainty that quantum mechanics

606
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,250
 and gravity can coexist that's

607
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,540
 not a small thing that's

608
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,870
 a very huge thing it's a huge thing einstein be proud einstein

609
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:34,500
 he might be appalled i don't know i'm like a very much yeah

610
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,860
 he would certainly be struck by it yeah i think

611
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:46,230
 that maybe at this time its biggest contribution to physics in illustrating almost definitively that quantum mechanics

612
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,800
 and gravity are very closely related and not inconsistent

613
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,230
 with each other is there a possibility of something deeper more profound that still is

614
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:01,350
 consistent with string theory but is deeper

615
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,270
 that is to be found well

616
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,910
 you could ask the same theme of quantum mechanics is there something exactly yeah

617
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:11,600
 yeah i think string theory is just an example of a quantum mechanical system that

618
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,590
 contains both gravitation

619
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,710
 and in quantum mechanics

620
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:21,120
 so is there something underlying quantum mechanics perhaps something deterministic

621
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:24,060
 so have something deterministic my

622
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,820
 friend far out it wolf whose name you may know he's a very famous physicist dutch

623
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,020
 not as famous as he should be but the heart

624
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,970
 dispels names it's hard to say his name you know it's easy to spelling ' he's only person

625
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,120
 i know his name begins with an apostrophe

626
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,470
 and he's one of my heroes in physics

627
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:49,040
 and it's a little younger than me but it's nonetheless one of my heroes the tufte believes

628
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,220
 that there was some sub

629
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,860
 structure to the world

630
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:00,510
 which is classical in character the deterministic in character

631
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:07,530
 which somehow by some mechanism that he has a hard time spelling out emerges

632
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:09,950
 as quantum mechanics i

633
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,640
 don't the wavefunction is somehow emergent the wavefunction

634
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,150
 and not just the wavefunction

635
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:20,619
 but the whole making the whole thing that goes with quantum mechanics uncertainty

636
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:21,940
 and pango

637
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,070
 meant all these things are emergent do

638
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,660
 you think quantum mechanics is the bottom of the well as is the right

639
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,880
 here i think is here

640
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,250
 i think is where you have to be humble here's

641
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,190
 where humility comes i don't think anybody should say anything

642
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,520
 is the bottom of the well at this time

643
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,500
 yes i think we i think we can reasonably say i

644
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
 can

645
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,740
 reasonably say when i look into the well i can't

646
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,830
 see past quantum mechanics i don't

647
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:55,050
 see any reason for it to be anything beyond quantum mechanics i

648
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,180
 think a tuft is a sperry interesting

649
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,109
 and deep questions i don't like his answers well

650
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:08,369
 again let me ask if we look at the deepest nature of reality with whether it's deterministic

651
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:09,960
 or

652
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,680
 unobserved is probabilistic

653
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
 what

654
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,240
 does that mean for our human

655
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,760
 level of ideas of free will is there any connection whatsoever from

656
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,680
 this perception perhaps illusion of free will that we have and the fundamental

657
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,220
 nature of reality the only thing i can say is i am i am

658
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:35,980
 puzzled by that as much as you are the illusion of it the illusion of consciousness

659
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,830
 the illusion of free will the illusion of self

660
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,850
 does that connect to

661
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,520
 how can a physical system do that and

662
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,880
 and i am as puzzled as anybody there's echoes of it in the observer effect

663
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
 yeah

664
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,050
 so do you understand

665
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,020
 what it means to be an observer i understand

666
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,980
 it at a technical

667
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,410
 level an observer is a system with enough degrees of freedom that it can record information and

668
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:09,070
 which can become entangled with the thing that's measuring entanglement is the key when a system

669
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,960
 which we call an apparatus

670
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,440
 or an observer same thing

671
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,380
 interacts with the system that it's observing it

672
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:22,390
 doesn't just look at it it becomes physically entangled with it and it's that entanglement

673
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,369
 which we call an observation

674
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,670
 or measure

675
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:31,660
 now does that satisfy me personally as an observer hmm

676
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,660
 yes

677
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,740
 and no i find it very satisfying that we have a mathematical representation of

678
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,550
 what it means to observe a system

679
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,200
 you are observing stuff right now

680
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,000
 yeah the conscious level right is you think there's echoes of that

681
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,670
 kind of entanglement in our macro scale yes absolutely for sure we're

682
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,590
 entangled with quantum mechanically entangled with everything in this room if we weren't of

683
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,380
 and it was just well we wouldn't be observing it

684
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:08,150
 but on the other hand you can ask though i really am

685
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,680
 i really comfortable with it and i'm uncomfortable with it in the same way that

686
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,780
 i can never get comfortable with five dimensions

687
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:21,770
 my my brain isn't wired for it are you comfortable with four dimensions a little

688
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:26,450
 bit more because i can always imagine the fourth dimension this time so

689
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:30,080
 the arrow of time are you comfortable with that arrow do

690
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,940
 you think time is an emergent phenomena

691
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,150
 or is it's fundamental to nature

692
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,860
 that is a big question in physics right now all the physics that we do or

693
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:45,730
 at least that the people that i am comfortable with talking to my

694
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,180
 my friends

695
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,550
 yeah my friends no

696
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,310
 we all ask the same question that you just asked in space

697
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:55,130
 we have a pretty good idea is emergent

698
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:00,890
 and it emerges out of tan tangle mint and other other things time

699
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,430
 always seems to be built into our equations as just

700
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,040
 what newton pretty much were for newton

701
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,540
 modified a little bit by einstein would have called time

702
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,700
 and

703
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,460
 and mostly in our equations it is not emergent

704
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,890
 time in physics is completely symmetric forward

705
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,570
 and bathymetric

706
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,010
 so you

707
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:32,180
 don't really need to think about the area of time for most physical phenomena the most microscopic phenomena

708
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,500
 no it's

709
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,570
 only when the phenomena involves systems

710
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,119
 which are big enough for thermal

711
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,099
 amyx to become important the entropy to become important for small

712
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,980
 subsets a small system entropy is not a good concept

713
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,150
 an entropy is something

714
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:55,720
 which which emerges out of large numbers it's a probabilistic idea it's a statistical idea

715
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,339
 and it's a thermodynamic idea thermodynamics requires lots

716
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:02,319
 and lots and lots of little sub structures

717
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,269
 okay

718
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:06,779
 so it's not until you emerge

719
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:12,900
 at the thermodynamic level that there's an arrow of time do we understand it

720
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,900
 yeah

721
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,470
 i think i think we understand better than most people think that most

722
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,400
 people say they think we understand it yeah i think we understand it it's

723
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,349
 just a statistical idea the you mean like second law thermodynamics entropy

724
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:26,950
 and

725
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,720
 so on yeah the pack of cards

726
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,460
 and you're flinging it in the air and you look

727
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,569
 what happens to it yeah

728
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:35,440
 but what's random we understand it doesn't go from random to

729
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,799
 simple it goes from simple to random

730
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:41,009
 but do you think it ever breaks down

731
00:41:41,009 --> 00:41:47,410
 what i think you can do is in a laboratory setting you can take a system

732
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,079
 which is somewhere intermediate between being small

733
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,079
 and being large

734
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,380
 and make it go backward a thing

735
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,509
 which looks like it only

736
00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:03,999
 wants to go forward because of statistical mechanical reasons because of the second law you

737
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:09,400
 can very very carefully manipulate it to make it run backward i don't

738
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,210
 think you can take an egg humpty dumpty who fell on the floor yeah

739
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,170
 and reverse that

740
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:19,660
 but you can in a very controlled situation you can take systems

741
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,710
 which appear to be evolving

742
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,809
 statistically toward randomness stop

743
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:29,499
 them reverse them and make them go back what's

744
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:30,759
 the intuition behind that

745
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:33,369
 how do how do we do that how do we reverse it a clue

746
00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:35,019
 you're saying closed system

747
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,239
 yeah pretty much closed system

748
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:41,739
 yes did you just say that time travel is possible no

749
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:44,349
 i didn't say time travel is possible i said

750
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:46,269
 you can make a system go backward in time

751
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:47,289
 and you

752
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:49,420
 don't like it go back you can make it reverse it steps

753
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,920
 you can make it reverse its trajectory

754
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,730
 yeah

755
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:58,540
 how do we do what's the intuition there does it have is it just a fluke thing

756
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,720
 that we can do at a small scale in the lab that doesn't have what

757
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,100
 i'm saying is you can do it on a little

758
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,320
 bit better than a small scale you

759
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,150
 can certainly do it with

760
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,930
 a simple small system small

761
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:16,800
 systems don't have any sense of the arrow of time atoms atoms

762
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,800
 no

763
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,480
 sense of the arrow of time they're completely reversible it's

764
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,900
 only when you have you know the second law of thermodynamics is the law of large numbers say

765
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,430
 you can break the law because it's

766
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,630
 not you can break german

767
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:33,880
 isn't the break it but it's hard it

768
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,400
 requires great care the bigger

769
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,810
 the system is the more to care the more the harder it is you

770
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,660
 have to overcome what's called chaos

771
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,880
 and that's hard and it

772
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,440
 requires more and more precision

773
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,940
 for 10 particles you

774
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,930
 might be able to do it with a with

775
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:57,460
 some effort 400 particles it's really hard for a thousand

776
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,850
 or a million particles forget it but not for any fundamental

777
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,820
 reason just because it's technologically too hard to

778
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,590
 make the system go backward

779
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:08,590
 so

780
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:12,610
 so note no time travel for engineering reasons

781
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,020
 oh no

782
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,220
 no no what is time travel time travel time

783
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,750
 travel to the future that's easy

784
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,620
 yes you just close your eyes go to sleep and you wake up in the future yeah

785
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:27,370
 yeah good nap gets you there yeah good map gets you there right

786
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:35,850
 but in reversing the second law of thermal

787
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:41,410
 is a very difficult engineering effort i wouldn't call that time travel

788
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,130
 because it gets to me too mixed up with what the science fiction calls time-travel

789
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:50,680
 right this is just the ability to reverse a system

790
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,900
 you take the system

791
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,610
 and you reverse

792
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,390
 the direction of motion of every molecule in it that

793
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,970
 input you can do it with one molecule

794
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,150
 if you

795
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,760
 find a particle moving in a certain direction let's

796
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,820
 not say a mama particle a baseball you

797
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:12,400
 stop it dead and then you simply reverse its motion in principle that's not too hard

798
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,310
 and it'll go back along its trajectory in

799
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:19,360
 the backward direction just running the program backwards running the program backward

800
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,170
 yeah okay

801
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:24,550
 if you have two baseball's colliding well you can do it but you

802
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,960
 have to be very very careful to get it just right

803
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,090
 now ten baseball's really really tore better yet tend

804
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:38,170
 ten billiard balls on an idealized frictionless billiard table mm-hmm

805
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:38,950
 okay

806
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,870
 so you start the balls all in a triangle right

807
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:45,160
 and you're whack them yep depending on the game you're playing you the wacom

808
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,100
 where you're really careful but the you're welcome

809
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,670
 and they go flying off in all possible directions

810
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,910
 okay try to reverse that

811
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:56,140
 try to reverse that imagine

812
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,120
 trying to take every billiard ball stopping

813
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,740
 it dated sometime at some point

814
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,660
 and reversing its motion

815
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:06,100
 so it was going in the opposite direction if you did that with tremendous

816
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,070
 care it would reassemble

817
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:10,770
 itself back into the triangle

818
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,870
 okay that is a fact

819
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:14,890
 and you can

820
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:19,140
 probably do it with two billiard balls maybe with three billion balls if you're really lucky

821
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,140
 but

822
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,070
 what happens is as the system gets more and more complicated you have to be more

823
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:29,860
 and more precise not to make the tiniest error because the tiniest errors will get magnified

824
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,050
 and you'll simply not be able to do the reversal

825
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,050
 so

826
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,310
 yeah you could that

827
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:38,260
 but i wouldn't call that time travel

828
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,460
 yeah that's something else

829
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:39,790
 but

830
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,980
 if you think think of it it

831
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:50,790
 just made me think if we think the unrolling of state that's happening as a program if

832
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:51,790
 we

833
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,760
 look at the world so the idea of looking

834
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,260
 at the world as a simulation as a computer

835
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:05,980
 but it's not a computer it's just a single program a question arises that might be useful how

836
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,690
 how hard is it to have a computer that runs the universe

837
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:11,620
 okay

838
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,020
 so

839
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,270
 there are mathematical

840
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,090
 universes that

841
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,050
 we know about one of them is called anti de sitter space

842
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,530
 where we

843
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:32,130
 and it's quantum mechanics well i think we could simulate it in a computer

844
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,590
 and a quantum computer classical

845
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,480
 computer all you can do is solve its equations

846
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,120
 you can't make it work like the real system if

847
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,150
 we could build a quantum computer or big enough one robust

848
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,050
 enough one we could probably

849
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:52,800
 simulate a universe a small version of an anti-de sitter universe

850
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,780
 and that the sitter is a kind of cosmology

851
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,780
 so

852
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,180
 i think we know how to do that the

853
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,700
 trouble is the universe that we live in is not the anti-de sitter geometry it's the decent

854
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:11,250
 or geometry and we don't really understand the quantum mechanics at all so

855
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:13,500
 at the present time i would say we wouldn't have the vaguest

856
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,300
 idea how to simulate a universe

857
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,060
 similar to our own you

858
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:24,410
 know we could ask oh we could we build in the laboratory a small version a

859
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:30,240
 quantum mechanical version the collection of quantum computers entangled

860
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,030
 and the couple together which

861
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:39,620
 would reproduce the the phenomena that go on in the universe even on a small scale

862
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,620
 yes

863
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:43,290
 if you were anti de sitter space know

864
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,600
 if it's the sitter space can you a slightly describe the sitter space and anti-de sitter space

865
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,010
 yeah

866
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,570
 what are the geometric properties of big

867
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,810
 different they differ by a this is the sine of a single constant

868
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,140
 called the cosmological constant

869
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:05,850
 one of them is negatively curved the other is positively curved the anti-de sitter space

870
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,340
 which is the negatively curved one you

871
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,020
 can think of as an isolated

872
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,700
 system in a box with reflecting walls you

873
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:21,900
 could think of it as a system of quantum mechanical system isolated in an isolated environment the

874
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,540
 sitter space is the one we really live in and that's the one that's exponentially expanding

875
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:35,030
 exponential expansion dark energy whatever you want to call it and we don't understand that mathematically

876
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:36,030
 do

877
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,359
 we understand not everybody would agree with me but i don't understand

878
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,909
 they would agree with me they definitely would agree with me that i don't understand it

879
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:50,969
 what about their an understanding of the birth the origin no the bing bang so knows

880
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:54,979
 what normally theories there are theories

881
00:49:54,979 --> 00:49:59,640
 my favorite is the one called eternal inflation the infinity

882
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,539
 can be on both sides

883
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,880
 on one of the sides and none of the sides so what my real opinion

884
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,880
 okay

885
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,670
 infinity on both sides

886
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,580
 oh

887
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,580
 boy

888
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,090
 yeah

889
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:19,540
 yeah that's why is that your favorite because it's the the most just

890
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,680
 mind-blowing no

891
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:26,260
 because we want a beginning no why do we want a beginning i

892
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,470
 practiced it was the beginning of course and practice it was a beginning

893
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,750
 but could it have been a

894
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:44,900
 random fluctuation in an otherwise infinite time maybe in any case the the eternal inflation theory

895
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,810
 i think if correctly understood it would be infinite in both directions

896
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:52,130
 how do you think about infinity

897
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:53,510
 oh god

898
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,700
 so

899
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,320
 okay of course you can think about mathematically

900
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,310
 i just finished this i just finished this discussion with my friend sergey brin yes

901
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:07,060
 how do you think about infinity i say well sergey brin is infinitely rich

902
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,200
 how do you test that hypothesis

903
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,350
 okay

904
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,590
 essential good lines all right

905
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:15,590
 yeah

906
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,390
 so there's no there's really no way to visualize some of these things like ya

907
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:24,500
 know this is a very good question those physics have any is

908
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,160
 does infinity have any place in physics right right

909
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:34,300
 and well i can say is very good question

910
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,050
 so

911
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,750
 what do you think of the recent first

912
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:42,590
 image of a black hole visualized from the event horizon telescope it

913
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:47,540
 it's an incredible triumph of science in itself the fact that there are black holes

914
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,340
 which collide is not a surprise

915
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,520
 and they seem to work exactly

916
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,070
 the way they're supposed to work will

917
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,120
 we learn a great deal from it i don't know i can i i we

918
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:04,810
 might but the kind of things we learn won't really be about black holes

919
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:11,000
 why there are black holes in nature of that particular mass scale

920
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,950
 and why they're so common may

921
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,530
 tell us something about the structure evolution of structure in the universe

922
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:21,160
 but i don't think it's going to tell us anything new about black holes

923
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,140
 but it's a triumph in the sense that you

924
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,490
 go back a hundred years and it was a continuous development general

925
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:32,120
 relativity the discovery of black holes ligo

926
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:37,089
 the incredible technology that went into ligo

927
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:39,929
 it is something that

928
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:47,729
 i never would have believed was gonna happen you know 30 40 years ago and

929
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:53,849
 i think it's a magnificent the structure magnificent thing

930
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:59,219
 this evolution of general relativity

931
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:06,869
 ligo high precision ability to measure things on a scale of 10 to the minus 21

932
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:08,489
 so

933
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:10,509
 so you're just astonishing

934
00:53:10,509 --> 00:53:14,199
 though we zoom all this just happy for us to this right

935
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:17,380
 picture is it different you know

936
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:22,109
 you've thought a lot about black holes is it how did you visualize them in your mind

937
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:28,919
 and is the picture different than you know lies that no it simply confirmed

938
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:34,029
 you know it's a magnificent triumph to have confirmed confirmed a direct observation

939
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:42,999
 yeah that einstein's theory of gravity at the level of black hole collisions actually works is awesome

940
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:45,519
 and it's really awesome you

941
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:48,249
 know i know some of the people who were involved in that they

942
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:49,269
 just thought married people

943
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:49,630
 yeah

944
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:54,189
 and the idea that they could carry this out i

945
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,519
 just don't i'm shocked yeah just

946
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,229
 these little homo sapiens

947
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:02,259
 yeah just these little monkeys got together right

948
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:07,650
 and took a picture of slightly advanced lemurs i think

949
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:11,109
 what kind of questions can science not currently answer

950
00:54:11,109 --> 00:54:16,209
 but you hope might be able to soon well you you've already addressed them what is consciousness

951
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:20,619
 for example do you think that's within the reach of science i think it's somewhat

952
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:22,449
 within the reach of science but i think that

953
00:54:22,449 --> 00:54:24,880
 now i think it's in the hands of the computer scientists

954
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,159
 and the neuroscientists

955
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,400
 i'm not a physicist perhaps with the helper haps at some point

956
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,369
 but i think physicists will try to simplify

957
00:54:33,369 --> 00:54:36,130
 it down to something that they can use their methods

958
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,979
 and maybe they're not appropriate maybe we

959
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:42,249
 maybe we simply need to do

960
00:54:42,249 --> 00:54:47,949
 more machine learning on bigger scales evolve machines machines

961
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:51,090
 not only that learn but volve their own architecture

962
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,910
 as a process of learning evolve in architecture

963
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:56,040
 not under our control only partially

964
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,390
 under our control but under the control of a machine learning

965
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,690
 i'll tell you another thing that i find awesome

966
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,510
 you know this google thing that they taught the computers

967
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,650
 how to play chess yeah

968
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:07,980
 yeah

969
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,870
 okay they taught the computers

970
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,060
 how to play chess not by teaching them how to play chess

971
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,730
 but just having them play against each other against

972
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,870
 each other itself against each other this is a form of evolution these

973
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:21,750
 machines evolved they evolved

974
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,470
 and intelligence

975
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,970
 they evolved in intelligence without anybody telling them how to do it

976
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:37,170
 and we're not engineered they just played against each other and got better and better and better

977
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,650
 that makes me think that machines can evolve intelligence

978
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:43,650
 what

979
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:48,120
 exact kind of intelligence i don't know but in understanding that

980
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,160
 better and better maybe we'll get better clues as to what there goes on your

981
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,860
 life and intelligence is last question

982
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,700
 what kind of questions can science not currently answer

983
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:04,010
 and may never be able to answer yeah

984
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,810
 is there an intelligence

985
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,360
 out there that's underlies the whole thing you

986
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,000
 can call them with the g word if you want i

987
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,200
 can say are we a computer simulation with a purpose

988
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:23,280
 is there an agent an intelligent agent that underlies

989
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,080
 or is responsible

990
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,330
 for the whole thing does

991
00:56:27,330 --> 00:56:29,400
 that intelligent agent satisfy

992
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,420
 the laws of physics does it satisfy the laws of quantum mechanics is it made of atoms

993
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,490
 and molecules yeah there's a lot of questions

994
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,170
 and i

995
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:42,150
 don't see this it seems to me a real question it's

996
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:48,500
 an answerable question well it's answerable the questions have to be answerable to be real

997
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:54,680
 some philosophers would say that a question is not a question unless it's answerable

998
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:00,890
 this question doesn't seem to me answerable by any known method

999
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:04,220
 but it seems to me real

1000
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:10,880
 there's no better place to end monitor thank you so much for talking about okay

1001
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:16,410
 you
