1
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:10,929
all right

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:11,330
uh

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,570
today is april 17th 2017

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,570
um

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:15,809
i am hansen

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:16,449
su

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:17,850
i'm john marov

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,449
david brock

9
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,330
ai tanan avan

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,090
great

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:22,970
so

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,490
um

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,849
this is the the

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,730
the apple chapter

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,529
if you will

16
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:27,890
and could

17
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:28,609
could we start

18
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,290
i'd like to start by asking what your role was in that transition period

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,370
are there things

20
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:41,489
that you remember about that really sort of jump out at you about the process of of going to

21
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:41,850
you know

22
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,690
next becoming part of apple

23
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,449
so you're talking about literally the transition right after the acquisition was done

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:48,809
well

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,930
even like the first things you remember about that process of the acquisition

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,489
and becoming part of becoming part of

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,170
okay

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,570
yeah

29
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,329
so i guess

30
00:00:58,339 --> 00:00:59,449
maybe i'll start with

31
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,050
uh

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,329
um

33
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,809
the process to get acquired

34
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:02,809
um

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,010
which started

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,130
i think it was just before thanksgiving around that time frame of 1996

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,250
and

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,250
uh

39
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,610
we had been watching in the press

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:17,770
um

41
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,329
about how apple was talking to be about potentially buying the company to get their os

42
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,009
because they needed a new os at the time

43
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,009
and you know

44
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:29,450
to be honest at next

45
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,409
our focus was more against competition from companies like sun than from apple

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,170
more in the workstation space

47
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,570
and so we weren't really weren't really paying too much attention to apple

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,570
but we had

49
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,329
um

50
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,009
while we were still supporting next step

51
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:44,490
of course

52
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,170
an open step

53
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,930
we had become increasingly focused on web objects

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,810
and so apple was not at all in that space

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,130
but when

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,610
um

57
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,009
i remember

58
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,610
when i saw some of those articles

59
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:56,610
um

60
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,610
i talked to steve jobs and said you know if they're going to buy an os

61
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,009
i mean we've got the best one

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,130
it's pretty clear

63
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,530
and so he made some calls into gil gil amilio

64
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,490
and in parallel

65
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,650
some of our marketing folks were making calls into apple as well at various different levels

66
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,769
and very quickly we had meetings set up to do technical evaluation

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,810
technical diligence

68
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,930
things like that

69
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,769
and in basically under a month we had a signed deal to be acquired

70
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,129
um

71
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,610
right after being acquired right after signing the deal to be acquired

72
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,970
so now we're looking at

73
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,610
uh

74
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,129
late december

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,530
couple days before christmas

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,370
uh

77
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,610
96

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,610
uh

79
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,090
as that quarter is coming to a close for apple

80
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,370
they had to pre-announce a major loss

81
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,769
and that kind of took us by surprise

82
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,810
we certainly didn't see that coming just because we weren't watching the company at all

83
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,810
um

84
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,129
we knew the company was struggling

85
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,290
but we didn't know that it was that bad off

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,650
um

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,409
but the deal went through

88
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:00,530
um

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,650
we actually started doing a little bit of integration

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,650
uh

91
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,010
in january

92
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:05,810
very little

93
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,489
because you can't really do the integration until the deals closed

94
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,849
which was in february

95
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,370
i think

96
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,569
february 6th or 7th of 97

97
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,049
but i remember

98
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,049
um

99
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,489
you know

100
00:03:15,499 --> 00:03:17,129
some of the initial interactions

101
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,129
uh

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,250
were

103
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,250
uh

104
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,730
helping gil to prepare a macor speech in early january

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,730
an ill-fated ma world speech went on for like three hours

106
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,810
the longest speech i've ever heard all of us

107
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,610
yeah

108
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,330
um

109
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,010
it was amazing to watch it

110
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,530
and i say that in a not good way for people just reading the transcript

111
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,290
were you in the audience

112
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:42,890
or were you back

113
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,650
i was in the audience

114
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:44,810
um

115
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,569
and our role

116
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,409
well

117
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:48,129
we had two roles

118
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,530
one

119
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,849
one role was ahead of time to help prepare gil

120
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,010
and his team for those parts of the keynote that would focus on the next acquisition

121
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,610
and that was only one small part of it

122
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,489
they had many many things to announce

123
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,090
yeah

124
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,610
um

125
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,569
and then our other role was

126
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,049
steve jobs did 10

127
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,569
15 minutes of his own

128
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,530
um

129
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,890
after gil talked about the the merger coming up

130
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,890
um

131
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,730
and and steve's part of course was very good

132
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,690
i think it's widely acknowledged that that was the case

133
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:18,690
um

134
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,810
so so that was one part of it

135
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,970
that was sort of the first thing

136
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,449
the real tangible thing that i remember

137
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,930
another tangible thing that i remember was

138
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,250
um

139
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,970
i started meeting with

140
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,810
uh

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,250
um

142
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,490
some folks who would either become my direct reports inside of apple

143
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,090
or were sort of key people at apple

144
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,570
that i would really need to get to know and and work with closely

145
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,210
if you will

146
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,130
beyond who are coming over from the next team

147
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:44,690
yeah

148
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,250
and you know that was a pretty eye-opening experience for me

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,729
because i got to see firsthand some of the things

150
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,650
that were causing apple to be in the state that it was in

151
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,210
yeah

152
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,889
so let me backwards and then go forwards

153
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,650
because talk a little bit about the management team at that juncture on the next side

154
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,050
um

155
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,930
were you part of a a small group of people who are making strategic decisions at next

156
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:13,930
yes

157
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,930
so you know that's an interesting question

158
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,090
um

159
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,970
in that i don't think a lot has really understood about what was going on

160
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,330
then

161
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:22,970
um

162
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,050
so i was part of the next executive team for many

163
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,610
many years

164
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,930
either informally or for normally

165
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,410
almost from when i started back in'88 um

166
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,729
but when we're looking in 96

167
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:36,729
um

168
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,850
you know the company had gone through some pretty big transitions

169
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,810
first

170
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,770
uh

171
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,889
getting out of the hardware business

172
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,729
huge transition and

173
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,009
then

174
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,009
uh

175
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,169
transitioning toward lot

176
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,449
similar

177
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,690
with the hardware business around that same time frame

178
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,449
running the software on multiple platforms

179
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,410
obviously there's no hardware

180
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,210
it's got to be software

181
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,490
but also then transitioning or adding

182
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,370
if you will the web objects business

183
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,410
which would have

184
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,930
i think

185
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,569
would have been very

186
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:03,970
very

187
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,009
huge at the time

188
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,009
um

189
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,970
and so we had a small management team

190
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:08,970
uh

191
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,250
i ran engineering

192
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,770
it was only software engineering

193
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,289
at the time

194
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:12,970
it was all of engineering

195
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,650
we had a cfo

196
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,449
we had someone running sales

197
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,889
i think we had someone running marketing

198
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,849
it was a somewhat traditional but small management team

199
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,130
but something interesting was going on

200
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,530
which was

201
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,250
as we transitioned out of hardware

202
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,610
and as we transition more toward selling a web solution on the server side

203
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,970
it was a more it was

204
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,849
it was an even more enterprise sale than it was before

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,930
and um

206
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,530
steve was getting fairly uninterested in that

207
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,970
and he was getting tired of it

208
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,410
and he had pixar going on on the side

209
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,210
and so what we were going to do

210
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,849
in fact

211
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,729
had we gone public and this is in the the draft

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,090
s1

213
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,970
we were going to form an office of the president

214
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,490
which would have been

215
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,330
um

216
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:09,970
me

217
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:10,889
i believe

218
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,770
uh

219
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,090
mitch mandich and who's our sales guy

220
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,889
and i believe dominique tro

221
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,610
who's our cfo

222
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,210
and and steve

223
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,729
i think we probably would have been part of that

224
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,650
he would have been ceo and chairman

225
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,129
but what we were really trying to do was also to take some of the load off him

226
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,050
so

227
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,889
and and frankly

228
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:30,729
you know

229
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,569
enterprise sales wasn't his expertise

230
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,970
so that was fine

231
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,009
and the rest of us we were all fully engaged and able to to take the business forward

232
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,250
so that's kind of what it looked like inside and then

233
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,569
was there a distinct board

234
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,610
and were there interesting board members that you remember

235
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,169
that were involved in that decision

236
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,849
that were separate from the management

237
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,729
so the office of the president

238
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,409
i mean the the office of the president decision

239
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:53,930
or the

240
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,409
the

241
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:54,849
i'm sorry

242
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,210
the merger decision

243
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,009
um

244
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,169
so i'm pretty sure ross was still on the board

245
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,169
um

246
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,449
i'm pretty sure canon had a representative

247
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,330
because

248
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,250
uh

249
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,250
they had done a $ 60 million loan

250
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,690
and if there was any other board members

251
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,650
i don't remember

252
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,569
obviously steve was a board member there may have been another

253
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,490
i don't remember

254
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,129
but it wasn't

255
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:19,490
it didn't show up as a separate decision making

256
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:19,889
pro

257
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,169
the

258
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:22,569
the key decisions were made at the management group level

259
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,970
the key decisions were made at the manag group

260
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,729
the management group level

261
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,330
the decision to sell was

262
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,210
you know

263
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,770
me and steve and a couple of others

264
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,330
and that was a no-brainer um

265
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,250
because we had a fair price

266
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,490
a good price

267
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,570
what i thought you know

268
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,330
similar to what

269
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,289
it would have been going public

270
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,929
with full liquidity at the time

271
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,130
and putting our our technology and people into a company that we thought could really magnify it

272
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,490
yeah

273
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,730
but this was taking

274
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,250
i mean

275
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,890
as i recall

276
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,209
i mean steve was coming back as kind of initially

277
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,330
he wasn't there as ceo

278
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,170
right it

279
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:56,370
it

280
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,690
it was

281
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,290
he was like a friend of the company

282
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,610
almost

283
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:58,890
so

284
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,410
now you're talking apple

285
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,970
so when we got to apple

286
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,370
we all got jobs at apple

287
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,690
but steve didn't and that was all by design

288
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,690
um

289
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,690
he didn't want one

290
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,010
and i mean what job is he going to have right

291
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,329
i mean

292
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,410
i guess they could have given him the ceo job

293
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,769
then he wouldn't have taken it

294
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,170
yeah

295
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,690
um

296
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,769
at least i don't think he would have

297
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:16,730
but that wasn't what the deal was and so

298
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,010
you know they knew apple knew that

299
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:20,810
um

300
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,450
and to gil's credit

301
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,690
gil knew that he needed steve to help

302
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:25,690
um

303
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,209
you know

304
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:29,290
gills criticized for a lot of things about what what he did with

305
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:29,890
rightly

306
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:30,209
so

307
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,329
but the one thing he got right was knowing that steve was going to be a positive um

308
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,450
and so steve basically signed on as an informal adviser

309
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,209
yeah

310
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:39,850
yeah

311
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,209
and do you remember

312
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,010
at steve's memorial

313
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,610
larry ellison told that what i thought was a really sweet story about them talking about how to

314
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,890
you know how to go back to apple and larry had a very sort of cutthroat

315
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,010
you know

316
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,930
steve could make billions of dollars of i don't quite remember the story

317
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,730
but it was larry wanted to make money

318
00:09:59,740 --> 00:09:59,930
office

319
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,930
steve wanted to do it because it was the right thing to do

320
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,290
did

321
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,610
am i telling it right

322
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,010
no sort of

323
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:07,890
um

324
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,930
the the essence of the story and and the true source of course should be larry

325
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,410
yeah

326
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:12,810
but

327
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,209
uh

328
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:14,130
the essence of the story

329
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,370
which i've heard from larry at that point and and in other other cases is that

330
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,050
um

331
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,370
obviously larry wanted to make a lot of money turning apple

332
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,370
um

333
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,170
and he wanted to help his friend steve

334
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,329
and steve really wanted apple to be success

335
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:29,570
successful

336
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,089
because it was his baby

337
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,089
um

338
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,450
and so larry's sort of idea was he would fund the takeover and install steve as ceo

339
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,170
and then together they would make it successful again

340
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:42,529
and

341
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,209
and

342
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:43,970
steve

343
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,329
according to larry

344
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,209
steve didn't really want to do it in a hustle way

345
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,610
he didn't think that was going to work

346
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,649
he didn't think that was going to be good

347
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,850
and he was still dealing with next and dealing with pixar

348
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,970
so that was a non-star now

349
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,209
steve never mentioned that to me

350
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,970
so i don't know to what extent it's been embellished

351
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,529
or you know how it's changed as it's been repeated many times

352
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:02,970
yeah

353
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,610
did you go ahead

354
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,570
uh

355
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,610
i was interested in asking about the

356
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,690
the bake off that you had with be

357
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,490
talk a little bit about that

358
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,970
the bake

359
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:12,290
off

360
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,209
so there was a

361
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,769
there was allegedly a bake

362
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:15,010
off

363
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,290
i only saw one side of that or one part of that

364
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,290
um

365
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,730
but i've been told by people who were in the room that there was indeed a bake off

366
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,130
and so as we were

367
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,130
um

368
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:24,930
uh

369
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,370
nearing the end of 1996

370
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,690
we done a bunch of uh discussions with the company

371
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,170
and they decided they wanted to do a bake off

372
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,730
be versus next

373
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,730
um

374
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:36,490
so

375
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:37,329
uh

376
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,769
we both went in at separate times

377
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:40,690
stage

378
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,610
we wouldn't meet each other there to the garden court hotel in palo alto and um

379
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,010
i don't know if we went first or they went first

380
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,050
i'm not even sure

381
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:50,930
uh

382
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,610
they may have gone first

383
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,209
but i don't remember

384
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,209
um

385
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,050
so steve

386
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,290
and i had an hour hour and a half or so to present our case to the management team

387
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,290
and

388
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,329
and we had

389
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,170
we had the benefit of a product that was in the market that worked great

390
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,490
that had been around for many years and b didn't

391
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,730
and so i remember

392
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,010
steve did his uh general sort of sales pitch on the company

393
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,649
and and the product and and everything we've got invested in and everything they could do

394
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,610
and we did just an incredibly dazzling demo

395
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,730
i remember

396
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,089
we had um productivity apps

397
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:29,089
um

398
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:29,690
we had

399
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,610
uh games

400
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,649
we had um

401
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,769
quicktime movies

402
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,649
four of them

403
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:35,130
on the screen

404
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,850
3d models all going at the same time literally on the screen

405
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,930
this was back in 1996

406
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,089
you know today

407
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:42,570
that's nothing

408
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:44,570
but we're talking over 20 years ago

409
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,209
that was a huge deal and the management team

410
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,010
i mean these guys were apple

411
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,089
i mean why couldn't they do that themselves

412
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,570
yeah

413
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,250
is probably what they're asking themselves right

414
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,010
and

415
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,370
and so we just had this great presentation and demo that

416
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,130
uh

417
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:01,810
i mean again

418
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,130
i don't

419
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,810
i wasn't in the room when be presented

420
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:04,810
um

421
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:05,850
but i think

422
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,170
they thought that they just had the deal done and there was only so much they could show

423
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:09,410
anyway

424
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,370
their product wasn't nearly as mature

425
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,010
their technology wasn't nearly as good

426
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,170
and so

427
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:14,850
uh

428
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,730
that happened

429
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,730
uh

430
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,089
when

431
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,050
when

432
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,610
uh

433
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,170
we finished

434
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,170
um

435
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,010
steve and i left the garden court hotel and we went for one of our

436
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,010
uh

437
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,370
you know

438
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,730
signature

439
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,209
steve jobs walks around palo alto

440
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,449
and as we're walking around one of the blocks

441
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:31,449
um

442
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,449
we happened to see someone who was in

443
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:37,649
that meeting from the management team who said you guys won easily

444
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,529
no problem

445
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,089
you have nothing to worry about

446
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,089
so that's how that happened

447
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,529
was nagel in the meeting too

448
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:44,690
was he still around at that point

449
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,649
or was nel gone

450
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:45,930
he

451
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,010
i think he was there

452
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,730
i don't think he was there

453
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,769
interesting and that that must be significant if he wasn't there

454
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:50,769
because wasn't he head of software

455
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,050
maybe he was gone by that time

456
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,089
so when i was there

457
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,170
excuse me just prior

458
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,769
the last real head of software that i knew of was ike

459
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:00,009
nassie

460
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:00,529
oh

461
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:00,690
ike

462
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,009
yeah

463
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,490
and i think ike had just left

464
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,370
yeah

465
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,089
and so they may have replaced him

466
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:07,410
but i don't

467
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,009
if there was someone that was there

468
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,329
it was it

469
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:12,089
just there was really no one there

470
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,690
ellen hancock

471
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:13,810
the woman had come from ibm

472
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,290
did

473
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,930
did she show up on your radar at all

474
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:16,889
um

475
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:17,769
ellen was in this meeting

476
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,170
i remember

477
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:18,810
she was in the meeting

478
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,490
ellen was the deao person in charge of software

479
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,009
she was in charge of all of technology

480
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,250
i believe all of products

481
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,370
so she was that de facto person

482
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:27,930
yeah

483
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,610
at at that point

484
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,050
um

485
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:32,370
you were more than a colleague of steve

486
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,009
when you

487
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,410
you were

488
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,570
you guys were friends

489
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,730
i mean talk a little bit about your relationship with steve at that point

490
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,490
wasn't it closer than being a business only relationship

491
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,410
yes

492
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:44,610
so

493
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:44,889
in

494
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,290
uh

495
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,170
96

496
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:47,930
97

497
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,610
um

498
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,449
trying to turn back the clock in my head and get the dates right

499
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:57,690
so when i joined next in 88

500
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,490
we quickly became good friends we hang out together

501
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,250
every once in a while

502
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:02,810
we go to dinner

503
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,370
a lot things like that

504
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,610
we

505
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,209
we were both of the the

506
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,050
we always like to work all the time

507
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,570
and so we could always we

508
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,529
we'd be outside of work

509
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:12,730
but we'd still be like talking about work and that was just great

510
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,850
and so

511
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,050
by the time this happened

512
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,050
um

513
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,170
he had married loren

514
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,970
i had married my wife

515
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:19,889
we both had kids

516
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:20,490
by then

517
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,529
from a friendship perspective

518
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,490
we started to drift apart a little bit because we were more with our families than with our friends

519
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,089
if you will

520
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,050
um

521
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,930
but we were still close

522
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,370
for sure

523
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:30,850
yeah

524
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:31,329
yeah

525
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,089
were you the best man at his

526
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,970
his wedding he had no best man

527
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,170
but i was at his wedding

528
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:36,649
okay

529
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,089
which was at um

530
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:38,690
in yuse

531
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,690
at valley

532
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,250
um

533
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,610
the

534
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,490
the wonderful lodge

535
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,329
the

536
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:43,209
yeah

537
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,009
that was a quite an event

538
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:46,810
yeah

539
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:47,810
yeah

540
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:48,649
um

541
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,889
so what can you say about

542
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,250
i mean

543
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,370
so what's always

544
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,370
you know

545
00:15:53,380 --> 00:16:00,529
striking is sort of the outside image of steve jobs versus the the steve jobs i know through the people i know who work for him

546
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:01,209
okay

547
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:02,690
which is it

548
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,610
it doesn't connect often

549
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,290
i mean you know people on the outside sort of say he can be harsh and a tyrant

550
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,649
and you know all of that

551
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:13,889
and yet very few people left over a long period of time

552
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:16,730
i the people who walked away from steve jobs are on the

553
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:16,930
you know

554
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,569
they're just not

555
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:18,250
so there must be

556
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,569
there must be some disconnect

557
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,410
i mean

558
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,410
and i just wondered if i mean if you're aware of the sort of the of

559
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,769
that kind of outside versus inside image

560
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:27,769
yeah

561
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,610
and maybe if we just back up a second

562
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,290
you asked if i was the best man at his wedding

563
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:31,930
i wasn't

564
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,449
but maybe what you're thinking is i put together his bachelor party

565
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:37,889
that's what it was

566
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,569
which is normally something the best man would do

567
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,009
yeah

568
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,889
but you know someone had to do it

569
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,449
so i stepped up and did it anyway

570
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:43,889
so

571
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:45,889
um

572
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,769
you kind of asked a couple questions about him there

573
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:56,250
and i i think you know one thing i'll say is i i explicitly asked him one day

574
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,769
so what's it like being famous and you've got this persona of who you are

575
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,009
what people think you are versus who you really are

576
00:17:03,019 --> 00:17:04,169
they're not necessarily the same

577
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,490
and his answer to me was very quick

578
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,929
and very straightforward and not like you had to think about it all

579
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:12,449
you kind of knew his answer well

580
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,410
that public

581
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,329
steve jobs is kind of like a brother

582
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,609
he's just some other person

583
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,369
he's not me

584
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,289
he looks like me

585
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,569
he sounds like me

586
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,770
but i'm a different person

587
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,689
my private person is a different person

588
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:23,650
it just a different person

589
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,650
so he kind of dealt with it that way

590
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:25,970
just

591
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:26,490
you know

592
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,289
that's the public view of who i am

593
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,809
and that's a role that i take on

594
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,210
it's like an actor

595
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,130
but a

596
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,650
but a brother

597
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,049
very

598
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,690
very close

599
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,250
yeah

600
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,210
and then

601
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:36,809
um

602
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,250
the other part of your question is

603
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,250
um

604
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:41,250
you know people

605
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,010
he was hard to work for

606
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,210
known to be hard to work for

607
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,090
yet people seem to stick around

608
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,090
um

609
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,530
yes

610
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,010
and no

611
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,650
um

612
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,650
he

613
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,130
certainly he was hard to work for much of the time

614
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,530
but he was also great to work for much of the time

615
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:57,690
um

616
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,690
if you

617
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,929
you needed to earn his respect

618
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,929
if you earn his respect in some form

619
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,130
and there are multiple ways to do that

620
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,450
in multiple forms it could take

621
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,450
then

622
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,450
um

623
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,890
he would generally be fair with you

624
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:13,650
he might be harsh

625
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,850
but he would generally be fair and because he had respect for you

626
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,650
um

627
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,090
you felt as though you could still work with them

628
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,809
even though you're getting criticized

629
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:24,809
and

630
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,169
and what usually it meant is

631
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:29,210
that you had thick enough skin that you were someone who could work for for him

632
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,090
and know that maybe he

633
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,010
if he's berating you today

634
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,289
he's not going to do that tomorrow because it'll change his mind

635
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,770
but the net of that was that people who couldn't do that

636
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,530
didn't last long

637
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,370
and so they would go away

638
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,450
but you'd kind of never really hear about it

639
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,570
just because it would just be one meeting and they're gone

640
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:48,570
okay

641
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,530
and and for them to even say they worked for him would almost be a lie

642
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,530
um

643
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,850
and and many people

644
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:55,929
the interesting

645
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:01,130
that i find is you find all these people who say they worked for him but never really did

646
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,250
they were like

647
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,049
maybe in a meeting with him one time

648
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,049
okay

649
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:06,690
and suddenly that's elevated to

650
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,929
i worked with steve jobs

651
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,730
and there are hundreds of if not thousands of people in the valley and beyond that

652
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,169
now say that which is

653
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:14,809
you know

654
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,370
yeah

655
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,850
if someone says they work for steve jobs

656
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,890
i like say

657
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,850
i don't even know that person is

658
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,289
they probably didn't okay

659
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,409
and that's usually the case

660
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,049
as opposed to the opposite where they really did work for him and work with him

661
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:26,049
um

662
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,570
on a substantial basis

663
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,210
people have told me that he would often reject ideas

664
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,049
but if you were forceful and stuck with your idea and didn't sort of back off

665
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,289
he would ultimately adopt things that would

666
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:39,690
would

667
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,049
you know

668
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:40,890
he would internalize them

669
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,570
they become his ideas at a certain point

670
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,690
absolutely true

671
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,130
and not

672
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,650
i mean not always

673
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,169
but

674
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:46,890
but it was possible

675
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,970
and the strategy was to get him to adopt your idea

676
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:51,610
yeah

677
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:51,890
right

678
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,970
because then he would go out and sell it and

679
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:54,730
um

680
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,850
you know

681
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,610
one day black could be the most important color in the world

682
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,970
and then the next year

683
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,049
and anyone who thought white was was an idiot

684
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,049
but then the next year it could be the opposite

685
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,090
white is it

686
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,330
and anyone who thinks black is

687
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,010
it is just wrong

688
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,010
okay

689
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,169
and it's not because the trend change

690
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,690
it's because they're just wrong

691
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,690
and

692
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,090
and so i don't want to say most of the time

693
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,289
but frequently he would push back on things just to see what was going to happen right

694
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:24,970
so if you're

695
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,650
if you present an idea to him and he says he doesn't like it

696
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,250
then what he's really saying is well

697
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,450
i don't really know if i like your idea or not defend it

698
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:35,530
okay

699
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,970
and if you could

700
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,650
then defend it

701
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,130
and it might take a while

702
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,130
okay

703
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,450
if you can defend it

704
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:42,289
then

705
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,250
uh

706
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,890
he'll go for it

707
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,169
and i have a great example of this

708
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,130
um

709
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,610
which i won't wait for you to ask about it

710
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,450
because it's a great example

711
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,250
and it's something that i didn't even remember or even realize

712
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,490
until he mentioned it in a press report many many years ago

713
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,530
so when we were doing the early version versions of mac os 10

714
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,289
one of the differences between mac os 10

715
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,890
and the prior mac os's 8 and n was that mac os 10 had inherently built into it

716
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,490
authentication

717
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,490
they were us quote users

718
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,409
right

719
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,970
whereas the mac

720
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,330
the old mac was just

721
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,090
it was your computer

722
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:16,929
right

723
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:18,770
there was no who you were or anything like that

724
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,850
you didn't log into it or anything

725
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,330
and as we were trying to figure out what mac os 10 should end up being

726
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,010
and reconciling it with the past

727
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,890
and not being too disruptive to users while adding in a lot of new technology

728
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,690
steve really kept pushing back on this notion that you had to log into your computer

729
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,490
he thought that was just wrong

730
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,850
you should never have to do that

731
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,529
it's your computer

732
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,850
it's on your desk

733
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:42,809
when you turn it on

734
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,169
it should be right there at your desktop and you're the owner

735
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:47,650
and so

736
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:47,929
if you

737
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,730
if you think about when we're having these discussions

738
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:50,929
this is 97

739
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:51,610
98

740
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,250
99

741
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,250
okay

742
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,850
very early on before people thought about security and computers very much

743
00:21:59,159 --> 00:21:59,409
um

744
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,490
and we'd have this discussion once a week for many months

745
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:06,490
um

746
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,330
and he would keep complaining and i would keep saying

747
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,130
no

748
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:09,650
we need it

749
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,049
we need it

750
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:10,730
but you know

751
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,049
at the time

752
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:14,010
i could never really articulate a good reason why we had to have it

753
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,570
because no one was talking about security

754
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,610
we had it

755
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,890
because you know we had a unix heritage and unix unix systems had this

756
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,690
and

757
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,809
but deep in my bones

758
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:25,409
i felt it was the right thing to do

759
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:26,970
and at some point

760
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:27,970
uh

761
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,809
after many

762
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,970
many months of of arguing this

763
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,570
he said i

764
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:31,890
i said

765
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,490
steve

766
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,210
i can't give you a really good reason why we must keep this

767
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:41,010
other than i believe in my bones

768
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,570
we must have this

769
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,850
and he said

770
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,370
okay

771
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,890
just make it easy to use

772
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:46,890
okay

773
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,650
which we did

774
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:48,130
and now

775
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,650
when you you turn on

776
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:49,850
auto

777
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,169
login

778
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,169
your mac logs in

779
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:51,370
automatically

780
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,250
right

781
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:52,850
it just works

782
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,529
i mean your phones have the concept of users in them

783
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:56,250
but you never see it

784
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,610
yeah

785
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:57,169
okay

786
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,130
um

787
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,690
and so

788
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,330
as time goes on

789
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,130
we ship the product

790
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,570
few more years go on

791
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:04,409
what happens

792
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,850
windows starts getting targeted by viruses

793
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,289
for the simple reason that you can download and install software

794
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,049
by just accidentally clicking on a link and nothing ever pops up to stop it

795
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,490
whereas on the mac

796
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,890
when you downloaded and click the link

797
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,169
that was going to do something that required any kind of privilege at all

798
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,690
it prompted you for your username and password

799
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:33,090
and that was one of the reasons the mac was spared so many years from getting these

800
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,650
and he realized many years after this decision

801
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,289
that trusting my gut feel

802
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,090
and i i couldn't articulate that reason

803
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,370
then

804
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,169
because that wasn't an issue

805
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:42,890
right

806
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,289
but it turned out to be one of these really smart things that we did that he agreed with

807
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,610
because he had a certain amount of respect for me and because he knew that

808
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,210
if i felt really strongly about this

809
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,529
even in this case where i couldn't articulate the reason he had to go with it

810
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:56,890
interesting

811
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:57,409
that's

812
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,409
and so you know

813
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,450
that's just kind of how he operated

814
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,570
but you know you really had to keep pushing on him to to to do

815
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,010
that to get him to finally agree

816
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,450
that was not easy

817
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,090
yeah

818
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,450
so that culture that you guys came into

819
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:14,690
i mean it wasn't a gil

820
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,330
amelo was a a creature of the semiconductor industry

821
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,130
and he had sort of cobbled that on top of the apple culture

822
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,570
i remember

823
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,890
when i interviewed steve early on

824
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,730
he described the first time he saw gil's executive dining room at apple

825
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,730
and you know

826
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,730
he told me about the silver

827
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,690
and how shocked he was at the silver and how that had gone away

828
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:34,690
um

829
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,409
how hard

830
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:35,929
i mean

831
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,210
how

832
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,850
what were the cultural things like when you first came into the the

833
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,210
the

834
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,809
you know the into apple

835
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,210
there was definitely those things you talk about

836
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,090
um

837
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,490
you know

838
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,409
food was plated into a really fancy dish and and things like that

839
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:53,169
not that i mean that might happen if i were to go to a board meeting

840
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,289
and there was lunch being served

841
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,770
if i was just getting lunch on my own

842
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,049
i'd go to the cafeteria and get it

843
00:24:57,399 --> 00:24:59,570
like most people there were

844
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,010
there was definitely some of those things

845
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,490
and to me

846
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,529
you know

847
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,210
my prior career had only been in a small company

848
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,730
startup

849
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,090
next right

850
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,169
or academic situation

851
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,090
where you don't get any of that stuff

852
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,649
and i just thought well

853
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:13,929
whatever

854
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:14,330
i mean

855
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,529
whatever

856
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,049
who cares

857
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:15,409
right

858
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:16,330
i mean i'm here to build products

859
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:16,929
right

860
00:25:16,939 --> 00:25:21,130
and if they want their dinner or lunch served on a nice piece of china

861
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,690
great

862
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,250
who cares

863
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:22,970
right

864
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,570
it's a big company

865
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,490
we got lots of money

866
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,770
i guess in the scheme of things it

867
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,409
it doesn't matter

868
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,370
but

869
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:28,649
but

870
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,210
um

871
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,890
i don't know that that was really a cultural thing that hurt the company from a product perspective

872
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:36,929
um

873
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,049
i think

874
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,010
instead

875
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:40,850
um

876
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,330
the

877
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,250
i don't know if it's a cultural thing or a management issue

878
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,690
what what really hurt the company was

879
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:48,690
um

880
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,809
it had gotten very successful on a product that was paying all the bills and completely lost focus

881
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:57,809
um

882
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,970
and had a bunch of truly smart people who are off pursuing their own things without any cohesive strategy

883
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,570
and and no leadership

884
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,210
really figuring out

885
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,490
well

886
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,289
what do we do

887
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,409
what's important to do

888
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:18,649
and you know every decision could be second guess and cause massive debate and decisions would not be made

889
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,010
or even worse

890
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,690
you could have two really smart people completely working against each other

891
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,409
and that that's really what the problem was

892
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,010
and when you came in

893
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,730
i i'i've forgotten now were

894
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,490
were tagan and kida completely gone already by that time

895
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,450
or were there still sort of vestiges of that

896
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,330
did you have to

897
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:37,770
sort of

898
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:38,890
you know

899
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,330
carve that away

900
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,570
um

901
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,890
those were not things i had to carve away

902
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:47,409
they may have still been around in some minor form

903
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,010
but it was

904
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,049
they were not issues

905
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,970
they were not issues

906
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,890
all the issues that i had to deal with were

907
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,010
you know

908
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,250
90 plus per internal issues

909
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,250
yeah

910
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,210
building a a new software design culture at the company

911
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:02,770
is

912
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,049
i me

913
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,730
it was

914
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,370
um

915
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,490
the issues were at multiple levels

916
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,890
so there there was the sort of management of people level

917
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:21,890
and then there was the strategy level and the management of people level was one of

918
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:23,929
um

919
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:24,929
well

920
00:27:24,939 --> 00:27:25,570
there's also operations

921
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,570
um

922
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,010
the management of people issue was

923
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,090
we had a lot of smart people who as i just mentioned

924
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,850
really weren't working on the same team

925
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,330
they were working for their own interests

926
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,049
and they all thought what they were doing was the right thing

927
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:39,169
um

928
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,809
and they needed someone to step in and say fundamentally

929
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:44,809
well

930
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,570
this is what we're doing

931
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,970
the decision's been made

932
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:49,970
either

933
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,690
you're you

934
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,529
i don't care if you agree or disagree with the decision

935
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,130
but this is what we're working on

936
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,409
and if you agree with it

937
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:57,010
great work on

938
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,010
if you don't agree with it

939
00:27:58,279 --> 00:27:59,690
then just say you don't agree with it

940
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,210
but that you're going to support it and work on it or leave the company

941
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,130
and that process caused a lot of people to leave the company

942
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,809
because they could not get on board with the decisions that were being made

943
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:17,529
and they suddenly realized that their side projects or their efforts to derail

944
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,570
these decisions were not going to be successful

945
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:21,570
um

946
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,890
and so they left or they were fired

947
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,450
or whatever

948
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,649
some combination thereof was

949
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:26,730
apple labs still around

950
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,409
was that

951
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,850
one of the things that was

952
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,730
it was called

953
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,210
i believe apple research and we shut it down

954
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,690
not because we didn't like research

955
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,049
but because from an operational perspective

956
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,529
we had to have all hands on deck working on the products that we thought were important

957
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,049
yeah

958
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:46,570
and so we could no longer afford to fund it and we could no longer take the risk

959
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,169
if you will

960
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,890
that they'd be going off in directions that didn't match what the company was going to do

961
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:53,690
especially when they're spending money the fact was they were spending money

962
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,690
we needed to spend that money on the things that needed to get done

963
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,330
remember

964
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,250
we're losing a lot money at this point in time

965
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,010
we don't have a lot of luxuries to do things like basic research

966
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,490
i remember

967
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,570
you know

968
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:13,370
one of those technical debates was over the uh executable format for os10

969
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,570
there was this mao versus uh pf format

970
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,490
um

971
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,890
i remember being oddly honious

972
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:23,890
uh

973
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:30,809
at the time over something that seems kind of trivial or not so important in the long run

974
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:36,769
so i don't remember that specific technical back and forth

975
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,010
if you will to be generous

976
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,010
um

977
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,049
but there were many like that

978
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,010
and

979
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:43,970
um

980
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,090
generally

981
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,210
you know

982
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,730
i would like to believe that every decision we made was the right one

983
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,289
for the right reasons

984
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,570
so good technology

985
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,570
um

986
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:57,049
you know

987
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:57,610
the right technology

988
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,929
good fit with customers

989
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:01,570
um

990
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,049
standards based

991
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,929
or if not

992
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,370
whatever

993
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,130
whatever is appropriate for for what it is

994
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,289
all those kinds of things

995
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,690
but

996
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,690
uh

997
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,929
we definitely had

998
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:12,929
um

999
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,570
a lot of passion inside the company for different things

1000
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,809
and the hardest thing was there

1001
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:23,169
there

1002
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,890
there were many times where we picked the technologies that were

1003
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,929
it was next versus apple

1004
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,610
if you will

1005
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,169
okay

1006
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:34,570
and the next technology was picked instead of the apple technology

1007
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,850
and it was usually because the next technology could be shown to be demonstrably

1008
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,610
superior in a number of ways

1009
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,210
but people didn't want to believe that was the reason

1010
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,010
because they just thought the apple side was losing

1011
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,289
that was not the case

1012
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:56,049
and you know there were probably a couple cases where here here's the issue

1013
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,570
a lot of times

1014
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,450
when these decisions were made

1015
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,330
it meant there would need to be some kind of transition with customers or developers

1016
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,049
because the technology was changing

1017
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:17,250
and that caused angst for people advocating keeping things the way that apple had done it before

1018
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,450
and um

1019
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,450
let me give a great example of this networking

1020
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,970
the networking standard for apple at the time was apple talk and apple talk was just wonderful

1021
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,970
networking for a land and there were ways to make it work beyond the land

1022
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:33,850
but it was kind of tricky

1023
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,250
it was designed for a land

1024
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,610
and in a land it worked great

1025
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:38,409
it was way better than tcpip

1026
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:44,769
but the rest of the world has standardized on tcpip and uh

1027
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,090
it was obvious to me

1028
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,570
and some others who weren't totally immersed with the appleway for many years

1029
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,730
that tcpip was going to win all the battles

1030
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,289
it was already winning the battles

1031
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:03,850
and at the time apple had an apple team working on apple talk and their ip stack was outsourced

1032
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,049
and so i said this doesn't make any sense

1033
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,490
networking is a key part of the product

1034
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,649
and oh

1035
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:11,090
by the way

1036
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,049
there's a standard networking stack that's open source

1037
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,289
that's been in use for many years

1038
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,210
and even if the standard isn't fully implemented in certain implementations

1039
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,809
this one we know is interoperable because it's the same one everybody else uses

1040
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,529
so we're just going to use this now just happens to be

1041
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:29,570
that's what next was already using

1042
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,289
so people look at that as a next versus apple decision

1043
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,610
when it is

1044
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,330
we are going to standardize on the networking of the future using the most standard

1045
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,850
and oh

1046
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,289
by the way

1047
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:42,049
free software

1048
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,010
and we're going to integrate that in

1049
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,330
well

1050
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,090
i got no end of complaints about that

1051
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,049
they got

1052
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:47,610
in fact

1053
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,010
people went around me all the way to steve saying we're going to tank the company if we do this

1054
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,929
and including the people who are selling us the stack

1055
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,610
the software stack from the outside

1056
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,850
they were making money off app

1057
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,970
and so i just sat down

1058
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,769
and i laid it out and said this is the standard of the future

1059
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,570
number one and number two

1060
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,049
this is the standard imple implementation

1061
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,289
number three

1062
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:09,409
it's free and open source

1063
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,809
people will keep working on it

1064
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,889
this is no-brainer decision

1065
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:12,730
end of discussion

1066
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,370
but it took an effort to get there

1067
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,130
and and so the good news of that was

1068
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,130
once

1069
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,250
you know

1070
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,809
usually i could just make these decisions myself

1071
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,570
if there was still unrest in the masses and in this case there was a little bit

1072
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,250
then

1073
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,450
once i got bought in

1074
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,690
then it was end of discussion

1075
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:32,130
and i could usually get him to buy in on that

1076
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,690
but there's a flip side of this

1077
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,529
which is that um engineers and again

1078
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:41,409
good engineers would come to me and they would say you can't do this

1079
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,730
our customers know and love apple talk

1080
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,130
they just plug in a new computer and it just works

1081
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,210
and that doesn't work with tcp

1082
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,610
i

1083
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,010
it works with apple talk and they plug in a printer

1084
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:52,450
it just works

1085
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,250
i said great

1086
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,529
so your job is to now make tcpip do this

1087
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,570
and now

1088
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,049
lo and behold

1089
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,730
here we are today

1090
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,889
20 years later using tcpip

1091
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:05,730
everybody just plugs in their computer or their printers and devices and everything

1092
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:06,769
and it just works

1093
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,850
and that's

1094
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,449
because we got motivated to fix a few problems

1095
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,168
and fill in a few gaps with dcpip that didn't allow to do that before

1096
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:22,929
and so the other point i made to them was what you're what you're advocating is a solution

1097
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,010
that is going to keep 3 % of the addressable market

1098
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,369
happy

1099
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,649
that was the existing customer base

1100
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,449
maybe it's 5

1101
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:30,449
%

1102
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,168
you're going to keep 3 to 5 % of the custo

1103
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,730
the potential customer base happy

1104
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:35,649
i'm like

1105
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:35,849
look

1106
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:37,129
i want to keep those people happy

1107
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,690
but i w have a way to go get the other 95 %

1108
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,050
and we can't get the other 95 % with something like apple talk

1109
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,409
they just never going to buy it

1110
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,129
okay

1111
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,089
and you know we never got the other 95

1112
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:47,089
%

1113
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,210
but you look today and apple's doing pretty well

1114
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:50,770
even with computers

1115
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,449
yeah

1116
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,250
and you know

1117
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,409
there were some people they just couldn't get their head around this way of thinking

1118
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,770
and they they either quit or were fired

1119
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,170
yeah

1120
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,250
and then the people that could

1121
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,170
they said you know what

1122
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,089
there's a few things wrong with tcpip today

1123
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,650
but we know how to fix that

1124
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,290
and we can work with the itf and change the standards and evolve it

1125
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,250
and you know

1126
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,130
do a few things with dhcp

1127
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,490
and other standards

1128
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,930
and fill in here

1129
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,609
and fill in there and make some dns changes and we can make this all work

1130
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:20,210
it does

1131
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:21,690
yeah

1132
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,250
go ahead was that

1133
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,290
so clearly

1134
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,089
embracing open standards and even incorporating open source was a big change in apple strategy

1135
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,490
um

1136
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,730
what motivated that was that something because of your

1137
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,170
you know

1138
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,690
because of nex

1139
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,250
nex was already doing that was that just sort of natural

1140
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,250
um

1141
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:41,890
yeah

1142
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,849
embracing open standards

1143
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:43,890
um

1144
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:44,890
and

1145
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,450
and

1146
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:45,890
uh

1147
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,890
we even published some of our lowlevel source code at the time

1148
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,290
that was a huge change for apple

1149
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,490
in the history of apple never been done

1150
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,609
it was something that steve wasn't all that jazzed about

1151
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:57,609
um

1152
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,849
but the the basic argument there was

1153
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:02,849
um

1154
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,170
we've got certain layers of software that have in the real world now traditionally become open source

1155
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:14,050
in the sort of important demographics of users

1156
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,010
developers

1157
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,210
for example

1158
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,250
um

1159
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,770
and there's not really any downside to open sourcing

1160
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,609
some of these things

1161
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,329
and in the case of of implementing standards is lots of upsides

1162
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,569
there's no need to have a closed network when you can now interoperate with everyone else

1163
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,089
especially when you're not the majority player

1164
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,089
um

1165
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,569
and so it was a big change

1166
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:39,569
uh

1167
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:40,609
and it was not

1168
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,010
it wasn't a no-brainer decision

1169
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,810
but it wasn't a hard decision to make either

1170
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:44,609
and

1171
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,410
and remember

1172
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,930
we always had the flexibility to control where we interoperated and where we didn't interoperate

1173
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,569
and what we open sourc

1174
00:36:51,579 --> 00:36:52,410
but we didn't open source

1175
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,530
we could control all those things ourselves

1176
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,810
this may not have been in your portfolio

1177
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:59,810
but one thing i saw in those first years

1178
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,530
um

1179
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:00,970
from the outside

1180
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:01,650
as a reporter

1181
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,329
is that apple started as a more open company

1182
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,770
i remember maybe twice

1183
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,530
coming down and interviewing you

1184
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:10,369
um

1185
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,170
and after the first two or three years

1186
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,650
i mean it was you and phil and johnny

1187
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,650
and i can't remember one other person

1188
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:16,810
we just sat down

1189
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,690
steve wasn't there and i was there

1190
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,569
as a new york times reporter

1191
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,250
i did a profile of johnny

1192
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,450
i very early

1193
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:23,450
um

1194
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:27,369
and then the company gradually became a company that spoke with one voice

1195
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,569
and i was that a strategy you were aware of

1196
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,609
or did i mean

1197
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,410
what did it look like from your side

1198
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,089
so i hadn't thought about that very much

1199
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,410
that's an interesting point

1200
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,050
you raise

1201
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,530
what i would say

1202
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,369
is that

1203
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,410
um

1204
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,050
right after the merger

1205
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:46,609
closed

1206
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,530
while gil was still ceo

1207
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:50,530
um

1208
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,170
it was typical for many

1209
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,569
many people to talk publicly

1210
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,290
in fact

1211
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,609
i remember

1212
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:57,890
uh

1213
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,569
that summer i went to paris to keynote apple expo paris

1214
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:02,569
um

1215
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:04,290
i don't remember exactly why i did it

1216
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:04,770
i think

1217
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,450
maybe because gil had done so poorly in january

1218
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,050
they wanted someone else to do it

1219
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,369
they sent me and

1220
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:13,329
and so that was not really an issue

1221
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,530
apple had lots of people out there in the press

1222
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,530
um

1223
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,690
if i were to speculate now i would say that maybe you're talking about a time

1224
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,970
where steve is not really the ceo

1225
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,369
he's interim ceo

1226
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,050
yeah

1227
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,730
i'm not sure

1228
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,770
probably in ceo

1229
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,849
and so he really does need other people to step up and talk

1230
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,210
and so that's going to be the people you just mentioned that i

1231
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,250
and then when he comes in to be ceo

1232
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:40,329
then the lockdown starts to happen

1233
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:40,970
yeah

1234
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:41,650
yeah

1235
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,329
it wasan

1236
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,770
it was

1237
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,250
it was

1238
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:43,530
i mean

1239
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:43,730
i

1240
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:44,410
i understood it

1241
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:44,650
it wasn't

1242
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,010
it

1243
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,130
wasn't

1244
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:45,530
you know

1245
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,849
wasn't in my interest as a reporter

1246
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,810
but i absolutely

1247
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:49,050
i could see it working

1248
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,050
um

1249
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:50,329
right

1250
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,890
from from steve's point of view

1251
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,250
he was building

1252
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,250
you know

1253
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:54,010
a singular

1254
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,010
uh

1255
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,410
you know

1256
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,690
he very clear

1257
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:57,530
uh

1258
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,089
picture of what apple was is

1259
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,410
is what you got as a result

1260
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,170
yes

1261
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:01,609
um

1262
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,410
um

1263
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,970
so i'm interested in the in that still in the transition period

1264
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,490
who were the sort of on the software side

1265
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,569
the key players from next

1266
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,130
and the

1267
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,690
the people

1268
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,609
the people who came in and took important roles

1269
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,369
who who stands out in in your mind

1270
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,050
so the key players from next

1271
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,490
um

1272
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,970
so at the time

1273
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:25,770
um

1274
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,210
it would have been brron stle

1275
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:30,170
who is my right-hand man

1276
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:38,329
basically brron brron basically took over what became mac os 10

1277
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:39,329
uh

1278
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:40,490
and turned that into the product

1279
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,130
while i

1280
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,410
i divided my time into some other areas like the classic mac os

1281
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,930
quick time and other software projects

1282
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:47,930
um

1283
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,450
and so he was probably the key manager i had coming over from next

1284
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,770
and then his key person would have been scott forall

1285
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,010
and so you see that actual chain of who ended up taking over software over over the years

1286
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,010
um

1287
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,329
and and scott was sort of the right-hand man for a lot of what was the appkit

1288
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,250
at the time

1289
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,690
some of the built-in applications

1290
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:08,730
things like that

1291
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,250
they were sort of the key people that we brought over up front

1292
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:12,730
initially

1293
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,530
was there ever any question about as as the merger happened

1294
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:19,410
about that role that you took as as senior vpf software

1295
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,690
or was that part of the deal

1296
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,690
did i mean

1297
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,770
did that happen simultaneously

1298
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:24,770
um

1299
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,369
so the day the deal closed

1300
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,890
i had a signed off for letter as senior vp of software engineering

1301
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,890
so that part of it was

1302
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,530
there's no question

1303
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,530
um

1304
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,250
what i think was more in question was

1305
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:36,730
well

1306
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,290
what are the actual responsibilities and how does this work in this huge organization

1307
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,290
um

1308
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,329
which we kind of worked out there was

1309
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:44,690
you know

1310
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:50,930
ellen hancock was still very much in the thought process of what strategy was and things like that

1311
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:51,810
uh

1312
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,170
still still held still

1313
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,690
sort of had gil's ear on strategic decisions

1314
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,170
um

1315
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,290
which was causing a little bit of trouble to get things done

1316
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:03,890
but we worked through that

1317
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,730
yeah

1318
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:05,329
and

1319
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:05,810
um

1320
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,210
what was it like to work for gil

1321
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:07,930
you

1322
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,170
you spent some time working for gil ailio

1323
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,170
yeah

1324
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,290
so working for gil

1325
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:12,849
was interesting

1326
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:13,450
i mean

1327
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,810
i found him to be a very nice person

1328
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:17,609
um

1329
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:18,730
you know

1330
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:23,210
i found him to really want to hear what i thought about everything

1331
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,250
he was sort of a if you will

1332
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,369
trying to be a sponge

1333
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,250
trying to learn

1334
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,930
cuz i was operating in areas he just didn't understand

1335
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,810
he seemed somewhat frustrated that

1336
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:35,450
um

1337
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,329
everybody was always critical of everything he was doing rightly or wrongly

1338
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:40,329
um

1339
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,890
and so

1340
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,890
and he gave me sort of free reign to do whatever i thought was right

1341
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:46,890
um

1342
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,690
he

1343
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,690
he

1344
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,130
really

1345
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,609
you know it

1346
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,970
when there were decisions where other people might be saying something that contradicted what i was saying

1347
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:59,010
he would really listen to me and his gut was to go with me

1348
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,450
and i think that was in part because he had just done the acquisition

1349
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,410
he trusted me

1350
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,690
but also because steve was telling him

1351
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,290
trust

1352
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,890
this guy

1353
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,130
listen to what this guy's saying

1354
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:08,849
what he says

1355
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,609
makes a lot of sense

1356
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:10,569
and so that was very helpful

1357
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,690
so you know the negatives you hear about gil

1358
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,930
i didn't directly experience myself

1359
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,210
because i was doing my thing

1360
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:18,730
that was independent

1361
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,530
i didn't need his help to do what i wanted to do other

1362
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,250
than to not get in my way

1363
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,010
yeah

1364
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:31,050
and what do you remember about the events that led to steve becoming io

1365
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,050
okay

1366
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,490
so the events to becoming io

1367
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,329
let me see

1368
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,770
if i remember the events correctly

1369
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:39,770
okay

1370
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,210
so we're

1371
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,970
we closed the acquisition in february

1372
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:42,970
um

1373
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:43,809
gil is still ceo

1374
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,290
steve is now adviser and um

1375
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,329
steve is not happy with gil

1376
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,410
clearly

1377
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:52,410
um

1378
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,250
he doesn't come out publicly and say that

1379
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,890
but in the background you can tell that's the case

1380
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:02,609
and the first thing that happens is shortly after the deal closes

1381
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,890
probably in the march time frame

1382
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:05,890
um

1383
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:12,130
there is a sale of 1. 5 million shares of apple stock at 13 and a quarter

1384
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,290
which is the lowest tick ever since

1385
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:17,290
okay

1386
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,770
that is the bottom price since 1996

1387
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,809
this is pre-split like 28 times

1388
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,490
yeah

1389
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,609
equivalent of 50 cents a share

1390
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:26,930
right

1391
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,089
something

1392
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,970
something like that

1393
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,290
yeah

1394
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,089
and no one knows who did it

1395
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:30,970
okay

1396
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,329
because these things aren't publicly disclosed

1397
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,170
but i know

1398
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,730
and the world knows that

1399
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,890
as part of the acquisition

1400
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,490
steve got 1. 5 million shares of stock and they restricted stock

1401
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:44,210
but he'd asked for the restrictions to be taken off so they could be tradable

1402
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:49,010
and most people thought that he was the one that did it

1403
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,849
and i asked him point blank

1404
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,650
was that your sale

1405
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,290
and he wouldn't tell me

1406
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:54,730
point blank

1407
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,809
but he led me to believe that it was him

1408
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:06,010
and so that was his public statement that he was not happy with gil in the company

1409
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,450
because it was widely reported at the time or theorized it was probably him

1410
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:10,930
yeah

1411
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,290
probably remember that

1412
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:12,609
yeah

1413
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:13,490
um

1414
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,930
and so you know

1415
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,250
that was sort of steve's way of making sure that everybody knew that gil shouldn't be the ceo

1416
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,930
and he did other things behind the scenes

1417
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,849
and there was plenty of material for the board to come to the conclusion

1418
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,609
that gil should not be ceo

1419
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:34,609
um

1420
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:36,530
so the board made that decision

1421
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,210
i believe

1422
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,210
um

1423
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,089
in july

1424
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,530
because i think fred anderson made the phone call to gil on the 4th of july saying

1425
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,089
that he'd been fired

1426
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:48,089
yeah

1427
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,650
and funny aside

1428
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,650
um

1429
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,690
which i've heard from fred

1430
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,369
so i believe it to be true

1431
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:54,369
uh

1432
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,369
is right after calling gil

1433
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,490
he called hancock

1434
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,490
who was also being fired to tell her she was being fired

1435
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:01,369
and

1436
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:02,089
um

1437
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,490
she first said

1438
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,890
he first said to ellen

1439
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,609
i think

1440
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,329
or something this

1441
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:06,530
where

1442
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:07,329
uh

1443
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:13,770
gil is no longer ceo and she thought he he was calling her to make her ceo

1444
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,210
but um

1445
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,010
she was also being fired

1446
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,730
so that was sort of

1447
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,250
you know

1448
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,210
that next step where fred takes over as acting ceo

1449
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,210
um

1450
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,890
the board had a confidence in him

1451
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,569
and steve had confidence in him and steve was having enough conversations with the board

1452
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,010
the board wanted steve to become to come in to be ceo

1453
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,250
but he wouldn't do it

1454
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:38,050
had pixar gone public at this point

1455
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,809
where was i don't think i don't think pixar in public

1456
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,490
was it until might have been 96 before that

1457
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:43,930
yeah

1458
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,170
or i don't remember it was around that time frame

1459
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:46,849
it might have just g

1460
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,930
head was pretty much in pixar at that point i remember

1461
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,569
wasn't it

1462
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:50,569
well

1463
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:52,730
he never spent that much time at pixart overall

1464
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:53,569
yeah

1465
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,250
it was never more than a day a week

1466
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:56,809
even when he was the busiest there

1467
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,329
but i think he was sly thinking about it a lot u

1468
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:02,650
but he was thinking about apple a lot too

1469
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,250
trust me

1470
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,730
he was thinking about apple a lot and he was working on these things behind the scenes

1471
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,130
so it was

1472
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,210
you know

1473
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,849
at that time we have no ceo

1474
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:17,290
ellen's gone

1475
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,970
it's a lot easier for me and john rubenstein to kind of get down

1476
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:20,970
what we think needs to be done

1477
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,410
fred is going to let us do whatever we think is right

1478
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,970
and steve is sort of there

1479
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,530
kind of talking with us

1480
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:27,170
making mak

1481
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:27,890
sure things are kind of going

1482
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,050
but he's not day-to-day but you know you can only go so long without a ceo

1483
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,290
and finally the board somehow convinced him to become interim ceo

1484
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,210
i don't know exactly what happened

1485
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,809
but i think it's just this notion that

1486
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:43,770
because he could be interim ceo it was kind of like a call option on the job

1487
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,290
and so if if he saw the path to success

1488
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,130
he would take the job if he worked on it for a few months

1489
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,849
and said this is just not going to work

1490
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:56,770
then he didn't have to get himself into it

1491
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,650
fail at it

1492
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,170
yeah

1493
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:58,730
yeah

1494
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,290
but i mean he dug right in and you know

1495
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,450
he started making some big decisions that we were all supportive of

1496
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:06,849
and you know

1497
00:47:06,859 --> 00:47:11,609
used his name essentially to to get behind what was going to go on things that were very unpopular

1498
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:12,609
yeah

1499
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,890
like what kinds of decisions

1500
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:15,890
oh

1501
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:17,730
um

1502
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,369
like cancelling the um

1503
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,809
the sabatical program right after a certain number

1504
00:47:23,819 --> 00:47:24,210
of years

1505
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,650
everyone was entitled to a six

1506
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,050
we sabatical

1507
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,050
um

1508
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,609
and remember there was this email that he forwarded to all of us

1509
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:34,970
he'received no

1510
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,450
there's an email that went around to the whole

1511
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,490
he had sent an email to the whole company saying

1512
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:40,329
uh

1513
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:42,130
outlining a few things that were going to change

1514
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:43,250
that was the sabatical

1515
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,130
was one of them

1516
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,609
and there were four or five other things

1517
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,250
and then someone had forged another email and sent it to the whole company

1518
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,609
that was sort of a parody of this saying

1519
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,450
and you must now work 24 by7

1520
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,369
or it was just it was

1521
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,010
it was just horrible

1522
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:56,770
it was horrible

1523
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,010
was that that was

1524
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,650
remember the park park

1525
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,050
different controversy

1526
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,050
yeah

1527
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,210
was that around

1528
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,530
well

1529
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,809
that was sort of an ongoing joke

1530
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:05,569
right

1531
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:06,369
there's not one controversy

1532
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,849
ongoing joke joke

1533
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,210
okay

1534
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:08,490
yeah

1535
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:12,770
and there are plenty of pictures to document that

1536
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:13,770
um

1537
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:19,930
there are many stories of steve jobs in vehicular [laughter] violations

1538
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:20,930
i

1539
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:21,650
at what point

1540
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,970
at what juncture did the microsoft investment happen

1541
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:24,450
that was

1542
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:25,569
that was

1543
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:26,369
um

1544
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:27,329
that was that summer

1545
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:27,849
yeah

1546
00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:28,050
it was

1547
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,650
that was

1548
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:30,849
um

1549
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,089
that was

1550
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,609
it was just before ma world boston

1551
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:35,609
whenever that was

1552
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,970
the deal was done the night before

1553
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,290
literally

1554
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,290
um

1555
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,290
because it was

1556
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,410
it was announced the next day

1557
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,530
remember with the uh

1558
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:42,849
the

1559
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,250
the video of bill gates and the front page

1560
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:45,450
picture

1561
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,170
in the new york times

1562
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,530
with a little sten exact

1563
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,490
the big brother bill

1564
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,010
big brother

1565
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:49,290
bill

1566
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:50,290
that's right

1567
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,890
so there's no time to rehearse to make sure it's going to look right

1568
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:53,130
it

1569
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,130
just that's the way it was

1570
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:54,530
yeah

1571
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:55,410
um

1572
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,849
so that was probably might have even been that july that year

1573
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,930
i think it was yeah

1574
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,410
and were you in involved in that discussion

1575
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,250
yes

1576
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:03,010
i was

1577
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,450
cuz

1578
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:03,930
you know

1579
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,329
we had

1580
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,130
we had discussions related to

1581
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:06,569
um

1582
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,290
it was

1583
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:07,849
it was a big deal

1584
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,650
it was microsoft was investing

1585
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,650
um

1586
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,089
patent cross license happened

1587
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:12,369
yeah

1588
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:12,809
um

1589
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:13,490
and

1590
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,250
uh

1591
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,690
we agreed to

1592
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,049
um

1593
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:20,490
we agreed to make ie the default browser on the mac

1594
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:21,089
that's right

1595
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:21,690
yeah

1596
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,130
those were the sort of three big things

1597
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:24,970
yeah

1598
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,650
which later turned into an antitrust l

1599
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:29,650
yeah

1600
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,049
did you get

1601
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:30,650
did you

1602
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:30,849
did

1603
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:31,010
you

1604
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:31,970
did you get

1605
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:33,250
did you have to test

1606
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:33,690
you did have

1607
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:34,530
yeah

1608
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:34,809
that's right

1609
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:35,089
yeah

1610
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:35,250
yeah

1611
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,809
as a second witness for the government

1612
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,490
that's right

1613
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,130
that's right

1614
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:38,690
okay

1615
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,490
um

1616
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,369
let's oh so

1617
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,210
and um

1618
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,010
had you worked with

1619
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,329
what was sort of

1620
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,450
what was your working relationship with john rubenstein like

1621
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,250
and when did you guys first start

1622
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,970
so john and i started working together at

1623
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,210
next

1624
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,290
would have been when he joined next

1625
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,210
i don't remember when it was

1626
00:49:59,220 --> 00:49:59,450
it

1627
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,770
probably 90ish 91

1628
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,650
is

1629
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:04,650
uh

1630
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,809
and john stayed there until we got out of the hard hardware business

1631
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,250
went off and did firepower and then

1632
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,410
um

1633
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,369
in that period of time between signing the deal for the acquisition in december and it closing in february

1634
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:21,970
we called up john and we had lunch with him in redwood city

1635
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,730
we said john

1636
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:24,250
we want you to come join us

1637
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,730
obi's going to run software and and you run hardware

1638
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,290
and he agreed to do it

1639
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:32,290
and

1640
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:32,730
uh

1641
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,609
so we were sort of the hardware software team

1642
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:35,609
um

1643
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,010
and we worked together all the way through

1644
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,650
we both resigned on

1645
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,089
i think he resigned

1646
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,530
his last day was like march 31st of 2006

1647
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,890
mine was april 1st of 2006

1648
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:47,809
we

1649
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:50,849
didn't work closely enough to get him exactly the same day

1650
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:51,849
um

1651
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,450
but

1652
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:52,849
um

1653
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,410
so we worked together very closely for all those years

1654
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,250
and you know

1655
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,450
john and i had a wonderful yet strenuous

1656
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:02,730
relationship

1657
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:03,730
um

1658
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,290
because we had to work together yet we often had competing goals

1659
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,530
and so

1660
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:12,530
you know

1661
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:13,210
while he

1662
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,890
his goal was to get a new hardware product out every 9 to 12 months

1663
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:19,490
whatever the cycle was and have the software for it

1664
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,250
my goal was to not worry about the hardware

1665
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,530
schedu

1666
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:23,530
just get the features right for the next release

1667
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,809
and so we are always locking heads

1668
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,170
um

1669
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,650
we'd fight a lot about things and priorities and who's working on what

1670
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:31,490
and

1671
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:32,490
um

1672
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,089
but we always figured it out

1673
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,730
and you know we didn't miss our dates in any way that anyone knew

1674
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,170
at least

1675
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:41,049
um

1676
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,450
and you know

1677
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,130
we ship by working together

1678
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,170
our teams ship great products

1679
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,609
so so we always knew we had that common goal of our teams working together to ship great products

1680
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:50,890
but behind the scenes

1681
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,290
we had to fight a lot and you know

1682
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,609
kind of keep our teams working together

1683
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,450
yeah

1684
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,890
when was it that you knew that

1685
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,130
do you roughly remember

1686
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,530
remember when you knew the turnaround had worked

1687
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,089
was it around

1688
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:04,650
was it around the pillow

1689
00:52:04,839 --> 00:52:05,089
imac

1690
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,130
or was it around

1691
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:06,490
hardware

1692
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,569
was it around software

1693
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,170
what

1694
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:12,290
what was the sort of sense you know we've really was steve's return

1695
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:12,930
what

1696
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:13,890
what

1697
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:14,890
when

1698
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,250
do i

1699
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:15,609
when

1700
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:16,730
did i know the turnaround worked

1701
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,250
i don't think i ever knew that

1702
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:20,329
i mean

1703
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,130
um

1704
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,130
look

1705
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,849
it was obvious

1706
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,329
once the iphone started going off the the charts

1707
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:28,329
okay

1708
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:30,490
but even developing the iphone

1709
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,930
it wasn't clear that the turn run had sort of worked

1710
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,530
i mean we were obviously making money and being successful

1711
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,730
and you know

1712
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:37,890
we've

1713
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,410
we've been selling

1714
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,490
we've been selling a lot of ipods

1715
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:44,049
and we've been selling more macs but still small in the grand scheme of things

1716
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:45,049
right

1717
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:45,970
and

1718
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:47,049
um

1719
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:49,369
the business is a tough business

1720
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,770
it's a hit based business

1721
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,450
right

1722
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,609
and so you got to keep the hits coming

1723
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:53,250
y

1724
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,450
and it's a competitive business and you

1725
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:56,849
you know

1726
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:01,970
i guess maybe we felt things probably didn't feel as dire

1727
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,730
once we were getting some traction with the imac

1728
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,569
and once we had mac os 10 out there and customers really starting to use it

1729
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:11,130
those were probably two two

1730
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:11,690
you know

1731
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,849
hardware and software events that really told us we didn't have to worry about

1732
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,049
there's no existential problem

1733
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:19,770
okay

1734
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:20,609
um

1735
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,089
but frankly we were still described in the press as the beleaguered copertino company

1736
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:27,089
right

1737
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:29,730
so i guess the interesting question would be to go back

1738
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,170
and pull out all the press articles and find out

1739
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,210
when bleer was taken off the name

1740
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:34,970
right

1741
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,210
yeah

1742
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,609
yeah

1743
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,369
i never fell into that camp

1744
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:37,930
i remember

1745
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,290
walt moser killed you off

1746
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,369
remember the obituary on the front cover of the did walt do that

1747
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,010
i don't remember

1748
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,730
walt wrote an obituary for apple

1749
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:45,690
well

1750
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,569
it was the merc that was always the worst

1751
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:48,569
yeah

1752
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:49,530
there was

1753
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,210
so i'll take your word that there was the walt one

1754
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:53,970
i'm going to go look that up when i'm done here

1755
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,890
there was obviously michael dell saying

1756
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,490
just give the money back to the shareholders right

1757
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,849
these are obviously low points

1758
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:02,049
and um

1759
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:03,650
so you know

1760
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,970
i mean when [music] um

1761
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,890
when 911 happened

1762
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,010
we took a big hit

1763
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,010
as did most of the economy

1764
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:11,730
yeah

1765
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:12,170
the valley

1766
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:12,530
the valley

1767
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:13,609
the whole valley did

1768
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:14,089
and

1769
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,170
and you know we were somewhat tenuous

1770
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:16,690
anyway

1771
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,250
we weren't the strongest company in the valley

1772
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:20,530
and so at that point it's like whoa

1773
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,329
what's going on here

1774
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,890
yeah

1775
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,089
right

1776
00:54:22,099 --> 00:54:22,210
and

1777
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,290
and we felt pretty good

1778
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:23,530
i remember

1779
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,290
we did a small buyback at the time

1780
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:26,210
um

1781
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:26,650
just

1782
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:26,930
you know

1783
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,010
to show confidence and almost out of patriotism

1784
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:31,049
um

1785
00:54:31,799 --> 00:54:32,569
but you know

1786
00:54:32,579 --> 00:54:34,890
we were shaken a little bit by what happened after that

1787
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,170
you know

1788
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:38,290
there was a time when the the cube came out

1789
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,410
which was not a hit at all

1790
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,530
and you kind of wonder

1791
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:41,329
yeah

1792
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:41,930
so it was

1793
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,290
it was

1794
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,809
there was never one point in time

1795
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,170
even with the ipod

1796
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,450
i mean the ipod start out relatively slow and it built up time

1797
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,250
and you know

1798
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:51,210
it did okay

1799
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,329
and then had a big bump up when we released the windows version

1800
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,569
and you know

1801
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:57,089
brought more people into look at and stuff

1802
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,490
but these were all slow things

1803
00:54:59,680 --> 00:54:59,930
yeah

1804
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:07,450
so there was a moment where probably where i gained my most greatest respect for steve as a strategist

1805
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,130
and it was

1806
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,369
it was an interesting sense

1807
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,010
um

1808
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,609
he telegraphed to me this switch to intel a year before it happened

1809
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:19,130
as like this chess match in the in the computer industry and i didn't get it

1810
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,289
until you guys made the switch and it was about

1811
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,010
you know

1812
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:22,530
video games

1813
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,329
going to the power pc architecture and p p going to the intel architecture

1814
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:29,849
and he

1815
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,849
we had a conversation like a year before

1816
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:33,609
where that was all in his head

1817
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:34,530
he knew he was going there

1818
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,730
and he said something to me when i looked back

1819
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:38,329
he had sort of told me it was going to happen

1820
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:42,289
and do you remember the strategy component of that

1821
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,450
well

1822
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:48,170
so him telling you a year in advance is only a surprise in

1823
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,010
that you're a member of the press

1824
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,369
and he would tell you something that's coming

1825
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,530
but he did he didn't really

1826
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:52,609
it was looking backwards

1827
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:53,490
i didn't get

1828
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,890
he didn't actually tell me he said something in retrospect

1829
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,250
remembered that it was obvious to him a year before that it was going in that direction

1830
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,049
that's because we already had it working

1831
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:02,650
yeah

1832
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,130
so one of the things about being in tech right is when a product is announced

1833
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,210
it was already working well before that

1834
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,089
and so the people who were already working on it knew that it's coming now

1835
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,970
he may not have known the exact date

1836
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,609
but as far as i was concerned

1837
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:19,890
we were working on that product the day i started at apple in 97

1838
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,609
and and we had software running on all the macs throughout all those years years

1839
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,170
yeah

1840
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:27,770
um

1841
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,530
and was that about options at that point to give you flexibility

1842
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,609
or what i mean in terms of that strategic relationship and all of that

1843
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:34,890
you know

1844
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,650
ibm ultimately couldn't deliver the

1845
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,289
was it 10 gigahertz processor that they promised

1846
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:40,289
yeah

1847
00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:41,690
i don't remember which processor it was

1848
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:42,049
but

1849
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,010
um

1850
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,410
for me

1851
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:46,410
um

1852
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,890
having our software running on an intel processor at some point in time was inevitable

1853
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,289
and so it always was about options and how we would execute those options

1854
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,329
and so i didn't know if

1855
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:01,049
like

1856
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:01,450
at next

1857
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:02,569
we got out of hardware business

1858
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,530
apple would have to get out of hardware business as a really radical change

1859
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,530
right

1860
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,530
in which case

1861
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,170
we'd have software to oem to different people

1862
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,849
or we'd be in the hardware business

1863
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,410
maybe building premium computers

1864
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:19,849
which apple's always been great at with someone else just doing a super lowcost computer right

1865
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,410
which would probably be based on an intel processor

1866
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,809
there are a whole number of or or what eventually happened

1867
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:29,490
which is just to switch the heart of the mac to an intel processor

1868
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,450
when the other vendors couldn't compete

1869
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:33,450
um

1870
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,049
on whatever access mattered

1871
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:36,289
and so

1872
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:37,609
um

1873
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:40,569
to me it was inevitable

1874
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:44,329
and so i viewed my job as running software to make

1875
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:48,130
i knew that at some point in time steve was going to say i need this product

1876
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,130
okay

1877
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:49,609
and i knew

1878
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:50,410
starting from scratch

1879
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:54,369
it was a 3 to five year effort because of everything involved

1880
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,450
okay to port an entire os and do emulation and everything else

1881
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,849
and so i knew i had to have it ready so that

1882
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:03,089
when it was time to pull the trigger

1883
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:04,890
we could get it out in 9 to 12 months

1884
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:05,450
okay

1885
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,770
which is what we ended up doing

1886
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:07,329
yeah

1887
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:08,089
yeah

1888
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,369
that's remarkable

1889
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:10,369
the

1890
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,010
the

1891
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:11,369
uh

1892
00:58:11,379 --> 00:58:15,609
the end of newton and then the roots of what became the iphone

1893
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:16,609
um

1894
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,450
what

1895
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,609
what did it look like from the inside

1896
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:19,289
okay

1897
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:20,210
so the end of newon

1898
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,730
that was one of those um

1899
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,170
straightforward decisions

1900
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,569
where only a handful of people second guessed it

1901
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,010
people in the newton division

1902
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,170
you know

1903
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,450
interesting technology

1904
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:32,809
no market traction

1905
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,450
after a long time spending a lot of money on it

1906
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,289
we got to focus

1907
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:37,289
okay

1908
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,490
wasn't clear where the volumes were going to be here

1909
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,809
so that was relatively straightforward

1910
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,289
relatively easy

1911
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:48,170
although it it did take a while to get that to happen

1912
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:52,170
and that was in part because newton was off in a separate division

1913
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,049
neither john nor i own that

1914
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:55,130
if either one of us had owned that

1915
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:55,849
it would have been gone instantly

1916
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,250
um

1917
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,329
but it was kind of off on some side with other management

1918
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,890
they were just kind of keeping it alive

1919
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:03,089
um

1920
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:04,770
longer to kill off

1921
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,049
like printers

1922
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,130
and other things that were just hanging on that needed to be killed off at the time the iphone

1923
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,130
um

1924
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,049
was interesting in that

1925
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:15,849
um

1926
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:17,450
i remember

1927
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:24,410
the first time i thought we would seriously think of doing an iphone someday was

1928
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:29,369
when we introduced a feature in mac os 10 called um

1929
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:32,089
i think it was the dashboard feature

1930
00:59:32,839 --> 00:59:33,890
that is the feature

1931
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,089
where you press one of the keys on the keyboard

1932
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,289
and and it brings up a bunch of widgets on your screen

1933
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:38,770
remember

1934
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:39,210
yeah

1935
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:39,690
so there's a

1936
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,490
there was a weather widget

1937
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:43,609
a stock widget and you could add other widgets

1938
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:46,089
there's all kinds of a little calculator widget quickly

1939
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,130
bring them up use them

1940
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:49,010
throw them away and i remember

1941
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,049
i looked at that and i said to myself and i

1942
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:52,730
the team were

1943
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,369
the first time our ui team showed this to us

1944
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,289
i remember saying saying

1945
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,329
oh my god

1946
00:59:57,559 --> 00:59:59,890
someday we're going to build a phone and that's going to be the user interface

1947
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,490
it's going to be these little widgets

1948
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,410
and oh

1949
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:03,849
by the way you take out your iphone today

1950
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,650
and it still has that very same stock widget and very same weather widget written the exact same way

1951
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:10,970
using little javascript stuff

1952
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,010
and so that was

1953
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:13,730
probably

1954
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:15,849
um

1955
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:16,849
got

1956
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:18,250
got to be early 2000s

1957
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,250
yeah

1958
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:20,289
and along with that

1959
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,089
and i forget the ordering of these things

1960
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:26,809
we had done some experiments with tablets using multi my touch

1961
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:28,130
and so

1962
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,130
um

1963
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:34,569
our lead guy doing a lot of our user interface stuff had built this prototype

1964
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:35,569
um

1965
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:36,170
where

1966
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,049
using multi-touch um

1967
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:43,010
you could with multiple fingers drag a map and zoom in and spin it around

1968
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,010
and all this kind of stuff

1969
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:45,530
and we thought that was totally cool

1970
01:00:46,119 --> 01:00:49,890
and so the hardware guys built some prototype tablets

1971
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,609
a few dozen of them

1972
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:51,970
maybe

1973
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:52,970
um

1974
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,890
that did a few of these things and i had one in my office and i'm sure john did

1975
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,210
and steve

1976
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,369
we all used them

1977
01:00:59,119 --> 01:00:59,369
um

1978
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,490
but this was just when we were getting wi-fi out there

1979
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:03,450
so it must have been early 2000s

1980
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,210
when the ibook came out with wi-fi

1981
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,690
i don't think we had wi-fi in this

1982
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:08,530
um

1983
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,569
it it might have

1984
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:10,329
but i don't

1985
01:01:10,339 --> 01:01:11,210
it probably did have wi-fi

1986
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:11,930
but that was it

1987
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,170
so this product was only useful in a couple places

1988
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,369
where you could get wi-fi you couldn't get wi-fi very many places right

1989
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:19,690
wi-fi was still unusual

1990
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,569
no one had it at home and there was no data

1991
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:23,450
ms that were useful

1992
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,450
so we thought

1993
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:24,930
hey

1994
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:26,329
this tablet's kind of interesting in

1995
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:27,930
except that it's not useful

1996
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:33,130
and this was back when other people were trying to ship tablets and finding there's no market for it

1997
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:33,490
for the reasons

1998
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,049
i just describ

1999
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,650
there's no connectivity to anything

2000
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,530
so we shelv all that

2001
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,809
so we sheld that and we we kept going on the widget stuff

2002
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:41,890
we kept improving that

2003
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,490
and then at some point it just started to make sense

2004
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:53,650
that you could in the form factor of a phone have enough processing power in a multi-touch display

2005
01:01:54,279 --> 01:01:57,569
and add the software to it and have it actually work

2006
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,130
yeah

2007
01:01:58,640 --> 01:01:58,890
now

2008
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,289
when we started working on this

2009
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:00,970
i don't know

2010
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:01,410
2004

2011
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,210
2005

2012
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:04,650
whatever it was somewhere in there

2013
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,049
no one really knew it was going to go

2014
01:02:07,319 --> 01:02:07,569
yeah

2015
01:02:07,579 --> 01:02:09,730
it was just was another ipod

2016
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,010
like project we're going to try it

2017
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,569
we're going to see what happens

2018
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,170
yeah

2019
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,089
were you around for the debate about about

2020
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:15,410
you know

2021
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,049
at that point the

2022
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:16,490
uh

2023
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,250
the blackberry had

2024
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:17,930
um

2025
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:19,010
rim had

2026
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,369
sort of

2027
01:02:19,379 --> 01:02:20,130
you know that was becoming

2028
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,130
i think it was

2029
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,250
it was out there in the world

2030
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:22,970
uh

2031
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,970
this notion of this chicklet keyboard

2032
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:25,970
um

2033
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,609
i heard that there was an internal debate about whether you would have a virtual keyboard

2034
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,450
or whether you would actually have a a physical

2035
01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:33,490
as a matter of fact

2036
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:36,490
i heard that phil schiller was on the wrong side of that debate

2037
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:43,490
that that he was committed to to keeping a keyboard in the were you in those debates

2038
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,210
so there was not much of a debate

2039
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:47,130
i mean there's always debate about everything

2040
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,930
and let's just say the extent to which there was such a debate

2041
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:51,650
it didn't matter

2042
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:52,770
because the decision had been made

2043
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,569
there was going to be no keyboard

2044
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:55,690
and so you can keep talking about it

2045
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,490
you bw in the face

2046
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:58,010
and i don't know if phil did or didn't

2047
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:58,770
i don't

2048
01:02:58,780 --> 01:02:59,809
i honestly don't remember

2049
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,609
but you know

2050
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:08,849
the advantages of no keyboard and a complete display were obvious and it was one of those steve jobs

2051
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:09,970
you know

2052
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,890
there's going to be no rescue boats

2053
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,329
we're going to

2054
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,130
this

2055
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:13,450
is it

2056
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:13,890
you're

2057
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,170
g to

2058
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:14,930
we're going to

2059
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:16,770
you know everything's going to be bet on this

2060
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:18,049
it's make or break it

2061
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:19,049
it's either going to work or not

2062
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,410
because when you put the keyboard on

2063
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,970
you're going to make decisions that are not good decisions

2064
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:23,970
okay

2065
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,289
it's like going back to the tcp typ thing

2066
01:03:26,299 --> 01:03:26,529
well

2067
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:27,289
this is what we're going to do

2068
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:28,289
make it work really well

2069
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,210
okay

2070
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,809
and if if it doesn't work really well

2071
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:31,170
well

2072
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:31,970
you screwed up

2073
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:32,410
yeah

2074
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,809
and so there was no

2075
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:38,089
there was no serious decision to be made

2076
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:38,970
the decision been made

2077
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:39,369
yeah

2078
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:40,450
what was your role

2079
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:41,289
um

2080
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:42,970
during that whole period

2081
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:43,970
um

2082
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,490
so by the time the serious work got going on the iphone

2083
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:49,089
i was mostly on the way out

2084
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:51,450
so my role was mostly

2085
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,690
i would say

2086
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:52,849
almost

2087
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:53,490
i don't remember

2088
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,049
my role was heavily to make sure the soft strategy was right

2089
01:03:57,799 --> 01:03:58,049
and

2090
01:03:58,599 --> 01:03:58,849
um

2091
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,089
we had

2092
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:00,730
um

2093
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,569
that that was a project scott forstall took on himself to pretty much own

2094
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:09,250
and from the software perspective to make happen

2095
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,250
um

2096
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,970
and my goal was just to make sure the software was going in the right direction

2097
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,970
and then let scott and the team deal with it all

2098
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:16,329
yeah

2099
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:17,369
and then the

2100
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,930
the kind of the

2101
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,410
what's the right way to describe it

2102
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:20,770
um

2103
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,490
was there always tension between tony fidel and scott forall

2104
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,609
was that an always a contentious relation relationship

2105
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:27,609
um

2106
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:28,569
gee

2107
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:29,809
i don't know if i should answer that question

2108
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:30,609
it's okay

2109
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:31,450
um

2110
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:32,210
yeah

2111
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:32,650
i probably

2112
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:33,890
i mean

2113
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:39,650
tony and scott are both great guys who have it's

2114
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,450
it's like me and john

2115
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:41,569
we would argue a lot

2116
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,329
but at the end of the day we'd come to terms to make the right decision to get things done

2117
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:45,809
yeah

2118
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:46,930
and let's just leave it at that

2119
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:47,529
yeah

2120
01:04:48,279 --> 01:04:48,529
um

2121
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:49,529
we didn't ask about

2122
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,289
so the raps city to mac os

2123
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:52,289
uh

2124
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:52,609
transition

2125
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,569
could you talk a little bit about that

2126
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,010
um

2127
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:57,529
how did it evolve over time

2128
01:04:58,279 --> 01:04:58,529
yeah

2129
01:04:58,539 --> 01:04:58,730
so

2130
01:04:58,740 --> 01:04:59,490
i mean you know

2131
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,289
the rap city to mac os transition was larg

2132
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:02,170
a marketing thing

2133
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:02,890
right

2134
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,890
i mean that's about

2135
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:07,609
we can go from mac os8

2136
01:05:08,359 --> 01:05:08,609
um

2137
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:15,450
which was just coming out when we all joined apple to mac os 9 and then mac os 10

2138
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:16,289
it

2139
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:17,730
it was a great marketing story

2140
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:23,809
we're just completely upgrading all the technology in a way that is as seamless as possible to users

2141
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,089
there are multiple layers of compati ab ility

2142
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:26,809
built into it

2143
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:27,650
and so

2144
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:29,450
instead of just you know

2145
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,849
telling customers something completely different

2146
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:32,890
it's just transition

2147
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:33,650
like with the hardware

2148
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:38,250
one day a mac had a power pc the next day it had an intel right

2149
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,450
but it was still a mac

2150
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:40,369
yeah

2151
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,930
i remember the

2152
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:47,809
the key difference from the way that rap cid had been pitched initially to um

2153
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,569
to the rebranding as os 10 was the availability of carbon

2154
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:58,089
and initially he had tried to sell rap city at being completely based on the next apis

2155
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,450
or the yellow box

2156
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,369
as you'd called it

2157
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:01,089
um

2158
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:03,730
and it seemed like there was a lot of developer push back

2159
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,809
and then carbon carbon was announced the the next year

2160
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,650
what was the process like of getting of

2161
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,690
you know of getting carbon up and how critical was carbon to the success of os 10

2162
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:15,289
yes

2163
01:06:15,299 --> 01:06:19,690
so the issue was to release a new os

2164
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,529
you have to have a way for developers to bring their apps forward

2165
01:06:24,279 --> 01:06:26,210
and we had what was called the blue box

2166
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,450
which could run a traditional mac os app

2167
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,930
just in an emulation mode

2168
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,650
if you will

2169
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:37,450
but that really wasn't good enough to letting mac apps take full advantage of the new os

2170
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,490
and when we talked to a lot of the big ones

2171
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:40,770
adobe

2172
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:41,250
microsoft

2173
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:42,130
and others

2174
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,130
it was clear they had good reasons why they couldn't just switch over to the new apis

2175
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:50,329
it was a lot of work

2176
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:57,890
and so with them we basically agreed to build an emulation layer called carbon

2177
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:02,010
which was a large part of the mac toolbox um

2178
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,890
running on quote on quote

2179
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:04,250
rap city

2180
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:04,730
if you will

2181
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,210
giving them the way to link against the new api to get most the advantages of the new os

2182
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,849
now we were able to pull this off in part because little known secret is

2183
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:17,450
if you go back in time and think about quicktime

2184
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,329
quicktime was a mac application which also ran on windows

2185
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,690
and the way they ran it on windows was

2186
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:27,089
by porting a reasonably large portion of with the mac toolkit over to windows

2187
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,730
so they had made a reasonably large portion of it portable

2188
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:31,730
um

2189
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:33,210
and so we started with some of that

2190
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:35,250
and added a lot to it to really make it more complete

2191
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,369
and came up with a whole carbon layer as

2192
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:38,049
well

2193
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:41,930
i had forgotten this but there was this um idea of um

2194
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,049
open step

2195
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,210
yellow box for windows

2196
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,849
but that never really what be

2197
01:07:46,859 --> 01:07:47,609
what became of that

2198
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:47,930
do you remember

2199
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:48,930
yeah

2200
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:53,529
so that would have been continuing the open step for windows product that next had

2201
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:56,289
and never became that important

2202
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,849
never became strategic to the company

2203
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:58,490
yeah

2204
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:00,130
so it wasn't pursuit

2205
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:01,130
and

2206
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:01,609
um

2207
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,529
the turning going from mock to darwin

2208
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,210
how how challenging was that

2209
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:08,130
well

2210
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,609
mock to darwin is no change

2211
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:11,289
say

2212
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:11,730
darwin

2213
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,329
darwin is the mock kernel that we used open

2214
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:14,690
sourced

2215
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:15,529
okay

2216
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:16,890
so you know

2217
01:08:16,899 --> 01:08:17,330
we obviously

2218
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:18,408
over the years made many

2219
01:08:18,419 --> 01:08:20,929
many changes to it and add the unix

2220
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:21,250
later

2221
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,890
the free bsd unix later into that

2222
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,529
that's what darwin

2223
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:24,089
was

2224
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:24,770
yeah

2225
01:08:25,158 --> 01:08:28,408
was it difficult to to to act to open source

2226
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:29,488
it

2227
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:30,488
um

2228
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,929
i assume you mean from a sort of philosophy or philosophical perspective

2229
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:35,569
it

2230
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,488
it wasn't that hard because large parts of it

2231
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:38,850
you know

2232
01:08:38,859 --> 01:08:42,569
both mock and unix came from open source environments to start with

2233
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:44,170
so it's very natural to do that

2234
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:44,729
yeah

2235
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,009
and um

2236
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:47,649
i i remember

2237
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:48,488
you know

2238
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,729
when os 10 shipped

2239
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:50,408
um

2240
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,569
carbon and cocoa were

2241
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:53,569
uh

2242
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:56,569
the message was that these were both both peer frameworks

2243
01:08:57,158 --> 01:09:01,250
they were both considered native and they would for the foreseeable future

2244
01:09:01,479 --> 01:09:02,969
both be going forward

2245
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:03,969
um

2246
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:04,649
obviously

2247
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:05,890
in the long run

2248
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:07,689
that wasn't going to be the case

2249
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,210
um

2250
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:10,250
but at that point in time like

2251
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:15,569
where did you see the sort of arc for how long carbon would be continuing to be supported

2252
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:16,689
um

2253
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,130
everything you said is completely correct

2254
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:22,448
carbon and coco were both peers

2255
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,609
if you will

2256
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:24,609
um

2257
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,408
there was

2258
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,448
at least in the early days

2259
01:09:26,459 --> 01:09:29,609
there was no plan to sunset carbon anytime soon

2260
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:30,609
um

2261
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,210
and yet we wanted to make sure that people transition

2262
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,170
so you didn't really see new features coming out on carbon whereas you did on coco

2263
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,170
and

2264
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:39,850
uh

2265
01:09:39,859 --> 01:09:40,969
you saw efforts to get

2266
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,250
we kept pushing developers on the coco

2267
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:45,049
because there were many advantages to doing that

2268
01:09:45,799 --> 01:09:46,049
and

2269
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:46,810
um

2270
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:47,529
it

2271
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:48,408
you know

2272
01:09:48,419 --> 01:09:48,569
i

2273
01:09:48,578 --> 01:09:53,089
i don't know if there was even a specific actual phase out date for carbon

2274
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:54,370
to be honest

2275
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,010
i

2276
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:55,210
i don't

2277
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:55,969
i don't remember when

2278
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:56,890
maybe maybe there was

2279
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,370
but it's not like we're actively trying to get rid of it right

2280
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:01,449
i think it was when

2281
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:02,370
um

2282
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,210
when os 10 went full 64bit

2283
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:10,570
and the coco went 64 bit and carbon wasn't and there was a big brew haa over that

2284
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,010
that that's possible

2285
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:12,530
yeah

2286
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,010
it's possible

2287
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:13,489
okay

2288
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:14,530
um

2289
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,010
from your perspective

2290
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,449
what was coco's big advantage over carbon

2291
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,170
why was it the the way to go

2292
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,170
well

2293
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:22,770
i mean that's a

2294
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,170
that's a complex complex question

2295
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:25,810
well

2296
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,130
that's a question with a complex answer

2297
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,929
and maybe the most succinct answer is just to say

2298
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,409
when you wrote an app in coco

2299
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,530
you were almost always guaranteed to have all your features work correctly

2300
01:10:37,719 --> 01:10:40,530
and consistently with the rest of the system with carbon

2301
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:40,969
you weren't

2302
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:41,850
because with coco

2303
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,090
you would do a very high level call and everything would just work

2304
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:48,330
you would get a complete text editor without writing any code

2305
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,130
and that text

2306
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,409
eder head the same feature in every single app with carbon

2307
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,770
all those things have to be built from scratch

2308
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,810
they're always all different

2309
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:55,330
yeah

2310
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:57,050
so it really contributed to consistency

2311
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:58,130
yeah

2312
01:10:58,880 --> 01:10:59,290
i remember

2313
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,570
at some point i don't remember what year

2314
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:01,090
bud tribble

2315
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,250
coming to berkeley

2316
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:03,610
we were both speaking

2317
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,409
he gave a talk

2318
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,170
and i remember i was just so stunned that he at one point said you know

2319
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,210
something like

2320
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:12,690
50 % of the lines of code in macos are actually open source

2321
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,290
he was talking about the bsd component

2322
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:15,730
i'm 50

2323
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:15,730
%

2324
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,050
is what sticks in my mind

2325
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:17,449
but it was

2326
01:11:17,459 --> 01:11:18,050
it was such a

2327
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:18,810
you know

2328
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:19,010
since

2329
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,330
to the outside world

2330
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:21,770
who knew you know it was

2331
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,370
it was

2332
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:22,850
it was hidden

2333
01:11:23,159 --> 01:11:23,409
um

2334
01:11:23,419 --> 01:11:24,210
but it was all there

2335
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:24,770
and i was just wondering

2336
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:25,890
i guess the

2337
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:26,489
the question is

2338
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,130
um

2339
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:28,130
the

2340
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:31,929
the attitude that apple had toward open source when you were when you were running the show

2341
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:35,570
what the attitude was definitely mixed

2342
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:36,570
um

2343
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:37,370
you know

2344
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,370
the company's history had always been to be closed

2345
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:40,370
uh

2346
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,530
with some good reasons

2347
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,090
and so you know

2348
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,050
we just

2349
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,090
we just became pragmatic about it

2350
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,250
and in those areas

2351
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:56,530
where it made sense to be open source and you could clearly see benefits with minimal risks

2352
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:57,650
we would do it

2353
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:58,650
um

2354
01:11:58,660 --> 01:11:59,050
and other

2355
01:11:59,440 --> 01:11:59,690
would

2356
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:00,650
wouldn't even talk about it

2357
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,690
why bother talking about it just wasn't worth it

2358
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,489
may i ask a question

2359
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:05,929
yeah

2360
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:06,570
um

2361
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:07,010
i would

2362
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,010
i would be interested to hear you describe those

2363
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:10,810
let's just say

2364
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:13,010
the first five years that you were at apple

2365
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,090
what is a day like for you

2366
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:15,690
you know

2367
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:16,170
um

2368
01:12:16,180 --> 01:12:16,370
you're

2369
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,449
you're tackling some really big engineering projects

2370
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:21,449
um

2371
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:23,449
and i'm just interested to hear you describe

2372
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:27,489
like how you the role you played in making them happen

2373
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,530
you know

2374
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:29,969
were you in meetings all day

2375
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,250
were you walking around

2376
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,250
um

2377
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:39,130
if you could give us some of of what it was like to be there and and doing that

2378
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:44,130
it seems like most of my days would either be

2379
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:45,850
um

2380
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,050
i've got

2381
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,330
we didn't have our online calendars

2382
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:49,250
so i had

2383
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:53,090
i'd have my note card with my list of meetings for the day

2384
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:55,690
and they'd be all backed up to five

2385
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,409
just because there was so many meetings you had to do

2386
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:02,570
or i'd be traveling somewhere for customer visit or conference or who knows what

2387
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:03,570
um

2388
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:04,210
so

2389
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,449
and in

2390
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,290
you know

2391
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:06,489
then

2392
01:13:06,499 --> 01:13:09,969
in the evenings there'd be dinner and then emails after dinner

2393
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:10,370
whatever

2394
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,730
so it was just

2395
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:15,130
it was a very busy time now that having been said

2396
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:17,530
um

2397
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:24,370
i would have to say that the time was spent in really useful ways

2398
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,210
making important decisions

2399
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,330
whether it's in an executive team meeting

2400
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:34,449
we're deciding on the strategy of the company or reviewing user interface

2401
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,969
which could be a three to four hour meeting

2402
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,250
that's just all back and forth

2403
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,090
it's

2404
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:40,449
i mean you barely think of it as a meeting

2405
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:43,050
you're just meeting with your colleagues reviewing their work

2406
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,690
giving them feedback stuff like that

2407
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,010
really high impact kind of interactions

2408
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,010
um

2409
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:49,969
and it would be

2410
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:50,969
you know

2411
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,889
there was obviously the management

2412
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:53,530
the direct management part of it

2413
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:53,770
you know

2414
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,409
meeting your all your reports

2415
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,290
one-on ones and figuring out status and challenging them to do really well

2416
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:00,730
all those things

2417
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:01,730
um

2418
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,330
but i think if you step up a level

2419
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:08,730
it was sort of this combination of this man

2420
01:14:08,740 --> 01:14:12,850
we're in this position where we can do something really important

2421
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:13,850
okay

2422
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:18,290
we can really change what people do in their

2423
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:19,010
what

2424
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:19,130
people

2425
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:21,330
having their deadly lives through technology

2426
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:26,290
and yet this difficulty of making it work

2427
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,570
you know again

2428
01:14:27,639 --> 01:14:29,810
the baguer company in copertina

2429
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:32,210
right about to go out of business

2430
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,210
yet

2431
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:34,489
that's what the outside

2432
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:35,210
inside

2433
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:37,130
it's like working on this really cool stuff

2434
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,210
that's better than anything else out there and it's going to make so many people so happy

2435
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,210
right

2436
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:48,409
and so there were these two competing things and it was a almost like a daily grind

2437
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,130
where you'd have

2438
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:50,810
oh my god

2439
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:51,449
this is so great

2440
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:52,370
this is going to be so cool

2441
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,929
when people get to use it versus we're about to go out of business

2442
01:14:56,679 --> 01:14:59,170
and this was a daily occurrence for all those years

2443
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,170
yeah

2444
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:00,810
um

2445
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:01,530
go ahead

2446
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:02,130
yeah

2447
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:02,770
uh

2448
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,969
i guess you know related to this

2449
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:05,449
um

2450
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:05,690
you know

2451
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:07,330
during those first couple of years

2452
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,330
uh

2453
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:13,770
you know you were still having to make sure that the classic macos os8 and os9

2454
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:14,770
um

2455
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,090
there was still work going on

2456
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,330
then to keep that going

2457
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,810
at what point

2458
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:19,810
um

2459
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,810
did you decide

2460
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:21,730
okay

2461
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:24,929
we can stop working on os9 and put all our eggs behind

2462
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:26,250
uh

2463
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,330
os 10

2464
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,330
um

2465
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:39,570
the strategy with os8 and then os9 was to incrementally improve it as long as we needed to

2466
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:44,449
which meant until we could get sufficient traction with mac os 10 that we didn't need it anymore

2467
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,370
and we didn't know how long that was going to take

2468
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,770
so we had a whole team devoted just to doing that

2469
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,570
and what happened was

2470
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:52,570
um

2471
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,690
just something very natural where

2472
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,850
when i first got there

2473
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:57,250
got there

2474
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:59,570
we staffed that team up very heavily

2475
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,010
a lot of people working on that it was was paying the bills and as the years went on

2476
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,530
we would just gradually transition people off that team onto the os10 team

2477
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,370
and i don't remember when we turned the lights off on mac os 9

2478
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:14,929
to be honest

2479
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,409
i can't remember when the last release was

2480
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:18,610
in fact

2481
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:20,929
it may have been because we switched to intel processors

2482
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:21,650
to be honest

2483
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:23,850
obviously it wasn't going to run on intel processors

2484
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:25,489
um

2485
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:30,050
but there may have been maintenance releases on most maxs right up until then

2486
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,050
um

2487
01:16:31,060 --> 01:16:31,929
just because we could

2488
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,290
but we we had a team dedicated to making that that work

2489
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:37,810
and we

2490
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:38,690
we

2491
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:44,010
that team knew that over time they could transition onto the os10 team in a meaningful way

2492
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:44,810
yeah

2493
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,690
what was refreshed me on the arc of web objects

2494
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:50,449
and and you know

2495
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:50,889
did

2496
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,610
did web

2497
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,530
did web objects come over for a while or did it go immediately

2498
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:55,250
yeah

2499
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,570
great web objects became an apple product and apple sold it for a while

2500
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:00,570
um

2501
01:17:00,639 --> 01:17:02,489
web objects was used internally

2502
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,449
quite a bit at apple to build some of the internal it systems

2503
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:09,449
i believe it was used for the first online store

2504
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:10,449
um

2505
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,810
i rically have been used for dell's online store

2506
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,050
um

2507
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,730
but over time it just out of neglect

2508
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,690
probably it never really went anywhere and just died

2509
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:21,290
a slow death

2510
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,850
cor strategy was elsewhere

2511
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:23,530
yeah

2512
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:23,730
exactly

2513
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,250
even though there had been so much potential

2514
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:27,610
if that had been next direction

2515
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:28,810
you said

2516
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,290
yeah

2517
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:29,489
you know

2518
01:17:29,499 --> 01:17:33,370
it's one of those things that really required a startup like company to keep investing in

2519
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:34,449
and have it be super important

2520
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,370
it was never going to be material to apple

2521
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,010
yeah

2522
01:17:37,159 --> 01:17:39,850
so it just died off when you got into the

2523
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:43,409
you know you've been at a small company all of a sudden were at apple

2524
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,530
what did the competitive land landscape look like

2525
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:47,010
i guess

2526
01:17:47,020 --> 01:17:48,810
either through your eyes or steve's eyes

2527
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:49,570
in terms of

2528
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:52,889
you know who the competitors were that mattered

2529
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:54,010
you know

2530
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:56,530
all it had been sun to certain extent

2531
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,290
maybe ibm

2532
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:58,570
those guys

2533
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,650
all of a sudden you were in a consumer world

2534
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:05,250
and who were the the people you cared about in in a way

2535
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,610
while things changed

2536
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:07,449
it didn't change

2537
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:07,850
now

2538
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:08,050
clearly

2539
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:10,130
microsoft was more of the direct competitor

2540
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,489
but you know we had spent a long time building a consumer os

2541
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:16,650
and that's what we were still now doing

2542
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,370
and so that wasn't that big of a change

2543
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:20,929
arguably

2544
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:24,690
the bigger change was operating on a different scale

2545
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:25,610
cuz

2546
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:27,650
the numbers were all much bigger

2547
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:28,650
um

2548
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:29,090
and ironically

2549
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,050
i was warned that i would never succeed

2550
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:37,570
because the scale of apple was much bigger than next and it wouldn't wouldn't be able to work whatever

2551
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:38,570
um

2552
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,969
but you know

2553
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,010
software is one of those things that scales pretty pretty easily and pretty well

2554
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,010
um

2555
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,370
so that proved to not be too much of a problem

2556
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:47,929
especially when you've got a good team working on things

2557
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:48,730
yeah

2558
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,690
what were the internal dynamics

2559
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:51,690
um

2560
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,290
that led you to

2561
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:56,130
did apple have to let you testify at the antitrust trial

2562
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,730
was that a discussion inside apple

2563
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,969
or was that a personal decision of yours

2564
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:01,770
um

2565
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,969
the way that came to be

2566
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,010
was

2567
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:06,969
um

2568
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:12,570
i think it was netscape that had taken the lead with the government on driving that lawsuit

2569
01:19:13,639 --> 01:19:13,889
and

2570
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:14,889
uh

2571
01:19:14,899 --> 01:19:16,690
so the government was looking to build its case

2572
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,770
so looking for other people to testify on their behalf

2573
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,170
and obviously apple made total sense

2574
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:23,889
right

2575
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,530
having been in the crosshairs with microsoft for so many years

2576
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:31,770
the the deal to bundle ie was an interesting part of that

2577
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:32,770
um

2578
01:19:33,159 --> 01:19:34,690
and so i

2579
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,929
what i believe happened at the time was they were trying to get steve jobs to testify

2580
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:41,850
i see

2581
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:50,690
and he said no way that's not going to happen and he volunteered [laughter] me

2582
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,210
makes it very simple

2583
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:53,810
so i had to do it

2584
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,130
did

2585
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,050
did ever cross paths with um

2586
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,290
i think he was sort of your equivalent

2587
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,010
a little bit

2588
01:19:58,020 --> 01:19:58,170
no

2589
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:02,130
it was maybe one step below steve mcy at intel who also test

2590
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:03,489
he was the one who

2591
01:20:04,239 --> 01:20:04,489
oh

2592
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:04,770
yeah

2593
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,449
what was his

2594
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:09,370
i mean he gave the quote to me and i'm forgetting what his quote was

2595
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,090
um

2596
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:12,570
it was about burying

2597
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:13,570
um

2598
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:13,770
oh

2599
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:15,050
we'll cut off the oxygen supply

2600
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,330
that was right

2601
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,090
i don't think i ever talked to him

2602
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,770
and they were pretty good about not wanting witnesses to talk to each other

2603
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:22,370
yeah

2604
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:22,929
yeah

2605
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:23,530
okay

2606
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:24,330
um

2607
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,929
the actual event and going to washington and stuff

2608
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,650
do you remember anything about it in particular

2609
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:30,810
was it was it fun

2610
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:32,730
was it like terrible

2611
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:33,730
uh

2612
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,050
it was an incredible experience

2613
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,130
um

2614
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:38,130
the

2615
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,050
i mean i

2616
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:39,290
i

2617
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:46,690
i think just testifying in any court case is probably pretty unusual but in this case it was like over the toop unusual

2618
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:48,050
and i remember

2619
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,050
um

2620
01:20:49,239 --> 01:20:52,290
so once it was decided that i would be the person to testify

2621
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,090
we hired someone to represent me

2622
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,090
um

2623
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:02,250
and so he starts doing his work and so he he meets with me and he says

2624
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:02,530
so

2625
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,010
a

2626
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,090
i want to tell you they put my name in as a witness

2627
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:08,330
and so immediately microsoft starts sending subpoenas

2628
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:15,610
and he said i want to tell you that microsoft has subpoenaed all your personnal records and i'm like

2629
01:21:15,719 --> 01:21:15,969
okay

2630
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,889
why would they do that

2631
01:21:16,899 --> 01:21:17,170
he's like

2632
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:17,330
well

2633
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:18,969
they're going to look for something to use against you

2634
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,370
he's like i've got your personnel records here and he added a folder

2635
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,810
which was basically empty

2636
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,010
he's like

2637
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,610
why is your folder empty

2638
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,010
and all that was

2639
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:31,409
there was like a review in there from bud from like 1989

2640
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:32,650
maybe 1990

2641
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,489
a couple couple of pieces of paper like that

2642
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:35,889
i'm like

2643
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:36,250
well

2644
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:37,489
i don't know

2645
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:38,810
that's my hr file

2646
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:39,610
i don't anything about it

2647
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:40,250
i've never seen it

2648
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:41,650
but yeah

2649
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:45,690
i don't normally get reviews and whatever

2650
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:47,730
so apparently this was a good thing

2651
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,010
but that was the reality

2652
01:21:49,639 --> 01:21:51,090
and how difficult was the cross

2653
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,530
do you remember anything about the cross

2654
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:53,530
um

2655
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:53,810
well

2656
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:53,969
the

2657
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:55,170
yeah

2658
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:57,010
the

2659
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,690
my part of the my part of testifying was actually

2660
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:04,130
it turned out to be relatively straightforward

2661
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:05,130
um

2662
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,409
and it's because we literally spent months in preparation

2663
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:09,770
so i almost had to like

2664
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:13,090
stop doing my job for a while and work with the lawyers for months

2665
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:13,770
yeah

2666
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,730
on documents that are being produced

2667
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:16,810
and what does this mean

2668
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,330
what does this mean they're going to use this

2669
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,170
they're going to use this

2670
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:20,210
and it was

2671
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,929
i mean room fulls of documents to go over

2672
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:23,929
and

2673
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:24,650
um

2674
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:24,850
um

2675
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,449
so you know

2676
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,370
during my no

2677
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:32,489
during the cross examination

2678
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,969
very early on

2679
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:44,170
something interesting happened where the person that was questioning me asked me a question very early on

2680
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:48,730
and i gave a fairly long-winded answer

2681
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,730
that was not good for microsoft

2682
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,330
it was not good at all

2683
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:52,770
it was

2684
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:53,690
you know

2685
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:54,409
i clear

2686
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,290
provided more information on this guy wanted

2687
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:00,530
that was not good and he immediately said to said to the judge

2688
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:00,889
your honor

2689
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,250
may i request that the witness keep his answers to the question

2690
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,929
and the judge immediately said

2691
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,530
i think that's exactly what he did

2692
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:13,489
so at that point i felt as though i had kind of went over the judge and uh

2693
01:23:13,499 --> 01:23:14,889
he started asking me questions directly

2694
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,650
which was virtually unheard of

2695
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:18,409
where

2696
01:23:18,419 --> 01:23:18,570
remember

2697
01:23:18,679 --> 01:23:18,929
remember

2698
01:23:18,939 --> 01:23:20,090
one of the big issues was

2699
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:20,650
um

2700
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,010
the bundling of the browser into the os

2701
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:23,969
the embedding of it

2702
01:23:24,159 --> 01:23:25,969
which today nobody does right

2703
01:23:25,979 --> 01:23:28,449
and microsoft was arguing that it was absolutely required

2704
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:31,210
so the judge turned to me at some point

2705
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:35,090
and asked me my opinions for if he thought it needed to be embedded

2706
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:36,290
and we're

2707
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:37,370
we're just having this dialogue

2708
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,969
and the guy cross-examining me is like twiddling his thumbs wondering what's going on here

2709
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:44,449
so that part went okay

2710
01:23:44,459 --> 01:23:46,090
but still it was extremely stressful

2711
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,409
you know it was one of those things where you walk to the front of the courthouse

2712
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,170
the federal courthouse in washington dc

2713
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:53,810
you know the capital is up on the side on one way

2714
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,090
what the white house is on the other side and you see these

2715
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:58,090
um

2716
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,730
you know big scaffoldings with cameras

2717
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:05,810
and news crews and cnn and cnbc and and all that kind of stuff

2718
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:08,010
and and then so i'i'fly there

2719
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:09,370
i'd fly home for the weekend

2720
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,250
oh yeah

2721
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:13,170
we watched you on tv all weekend or all all during the week

2722
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:13,570
cu

2723
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:14,650
like every 10 minutes

2724
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,409
it's the news thing

2725
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:16,889
yeah

2726
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:17,730
so it was

2727
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,130
it was kind of incredible

2728
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,090
it's amazing

2729
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,370
tell us about the transition to becoming

2730
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,090
um

2731
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:23,290
oh

2732
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:23,409
sorry

2733
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,210
um

2734
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:30,489
i was wondering how impactful do you think your testimony was in that case

2735
01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:31,610
you know

2736
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,050
there's there's no way to know

2737
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:39,330
but given that the judge found for the government

2738
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:41,690
right so the government want its case

2739
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:45,210
and given the way he personally interrogated me

2740
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,889
and given what i could say

2741
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,170
well

2742
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,889
you can have a browser in with the os

2743
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:53,570
but you don't have to have it built in the way they've done it

2744
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:55,130
i think that was

2745
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:56,130
i'm told

2746
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:57,610
that was pretty damaging to their case

2747
01:24:58,239 --> 01:24:59,409
but who knows

2748
01:24:59,419 --> 01:24:59,770
for sure

2749
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:00,610
i mean there were many

2750
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:01,690
many other witnesses

2751
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:02,690
many

2752
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:03,409
many other considerations

2753
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:04,409
yeah

2754
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,130
yeah

2755
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,050
i wanted to ask about the transition to becoming chief software technology officer

2756
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:10,130
and what what that meant

2757
01:25:10,199 --> 01:25:13,489
and what did it signify um

2758
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:18,730
so that was the result of

2759
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:19,730
so

2760
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:20,290
i think we're

2761
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,210
we're talking around 2004 now

2762
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:30,170
and so so i had been in charge directly of software for seven years

2763
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,810
and i'd been in charge of software and effectively leading software

2764
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,810
for a long time

2765
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:36,810
at next

2766
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,090
nine years

2767
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,530
at next

2768
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,050
right

2769
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,810
so that's about 16 years in the trenches

2770
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:42,770
on the line

2771
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,290
delivering products

2772
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:45,409
you know

2773
01:25:45,419 --> 01:25:47,850
under the microscope of steve jobs

2774
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:52,889
and so somehow we got into discussion and it's like

2775
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:54,010
you know

2776
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:55,130
i've had enough of this

2777
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,929
and let's find another way for me to keep doing kind of what i do

2778
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,969
and so we came up with this chief software technology office officer job

2779
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:05,369
um

2780
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,090
which we both thought was a great

2781
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:08,210
it was as simple as that

2782
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,210
it was like you know i've been doing this a long time

2783
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:11,889
but i don't want to leave the company

2784
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,730
he doesn't want me to leave the company

2785
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:14,730
um

2786
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,489
and you know

2787
01:26:15,499 --> 01:26:17,409
let's give brron a shot to run this

2788
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:18,409
um

2789
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,210
and that's simply how it happened

2790
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,250
and and response to david's question about what you did during your day

2791
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:26,530
i wanted to ask two sort of follow on one is

2792
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:28,929
did you ever find time to manage by walking around

2793
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,489
were you

2794
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:31,050
were you a manage by walking around

2795
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:31,690
kind of person

2796
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:35,210
or was that valuable to just wander out amongst the programmers

2797
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:36,929
you know

2798
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:39,210
i want to say yes

2799
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,770
because or walking around with the programmers yes is

2800
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:42,969
i want to say that

2801
01:26:42,979 --> 01:26:43,210
yes

2802
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,650
because it sounds like the right thing to do

2803
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:45,850
but programmers

2804
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,530
they're in their office with the door closed

2805
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,130
focused on their screen

2806
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,130
okay

2807
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:55,690
they don't want you knock it on their office unless you've got a good reason to

2808
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:00,210
so what i would do instead was have a strong presence

2809
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,050
either with a communication meeting

2810
01:27:02,199 --> 01:27:02,889
talking with everyone

2811
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:07,010
filled in questions or in review meetings where there were lots of people

2812
01:27:07,159 --> 01:27:07,409
20

2813
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:07,730
30

2814
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,929
even 40 people reviewing a product being part of that process

2815
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,889
asking questions using all the products

2816
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,369
filing bugs for specific engineers

2817
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,850
against certain parts of the project

2818
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,770
doing all those kinds of things

2819
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:20,889
which is a form

2820
01:27:21,239 --> 01:27:21,650
i guess

2821
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:24,730
of walking around but not literally walking around

2822
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:29,409
so i was very much in the stream of consciousness of lots of people

2823
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:34,770
but in a way that's a little bit perhaps unusual or non-standard and then

2824
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:35,210
you know

2825
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,010
the kind of day you described

2826
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,770
where you're basically interacting and responding all day long and even into the evening

2827
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,130
when you became

2828
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:42,850
um

2829
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:43,690
the

2830
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:45,610
the software technology offer did

2831
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:49,290
did you actually get the time to think more than the next product release

2832
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:49,969
i mean i

2833
01:27:50,119 --> 01:27:50,810
and what's that

2834
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,090
like

2835
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:54,170
i mean to to actually think more than one generation into the future

2836
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:54,929
yeah

2837
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:55,929
so that was a total change

2838
01:27:56,679 --> 01:27:58,010
the days were not booked

2839
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,290
al all day solid

2840
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:01,489
i didn't have any direct reports anymore to deal with

2841
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:03,210
and brron dealt with all that

2842
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:07,090
and i could just kind of go around and literally poke on things

2843
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:10,449
and you know i'd hang around with steve and see what products he's looking out

2844
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:11,130
review things

2845
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:12,770
which was sometimes good

2846
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,449
sometimes bad

2847
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:14,449
um

2848
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:14,889
and

2849
01:28:15,080 --> 01:28:16,210
and you know

2850
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:16,530
i

2851
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,690
i did think more strategically

2852
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,090
i let me step back

2853
01:28:19,239 --> 01:28:24,449
and do things like talk to people about what the software strategy for iphone should be

2854
01:28:24,459 --> 01:28:25,050
how we can do that

2855
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:28,730
cuz we had options there and and a lot of other things like that

2856
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,210
you know

2857
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,449
be more perspective about the intel switch

2858
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:33,889
things like that

2859
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:34,250
yeah

2860
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:34,810
yeah

2861
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:36,730
um

2862
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:37,850
this is

2863
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:39,570
this is um hansen's question

2864
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,850
because i don't know enough about it

2865
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,050
it says

2866
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:41,770
he says

2867
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:46,489
how difficult was it to convince steve that the itunes store had to be on windows

2868
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:47,489
um

2869
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,889
so that's actually getting the ipod on windows

2870
01:28:51,639 --> 01:28:54,530
getting the ipod on windows was the key thing in the store

2871
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:55,330
yeah

2872
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:56,330
they all go hand in hand

2873
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:57,570
um

2874
01:28:58,320 --> 01:28:58,570
um

2875
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,090
it was

2876
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,650
it was about putting itunes itself on windows

2877
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,929
which ena the ipod to work on windows

2878
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:07,409
and you know it was

2879
01:29:07,419 --> 01:29:08,130
it just took time

2880
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,369
it took time and it it took some numbers

2881
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:10,969
you know

2882
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:11,250
i

2883
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:11,570
i

2884
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:14,449
i give that decision credit to phil

2885
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:15,449
um

2886
01:29:15,459 --> 01:29:18,489
phil did a lot of leg work to really show what the opportunity was

2887
01:29:19,239 --> 01:29:19,489
uh

2888
01:29:19,499 --> 01:29:20,530
by moving it over to windows

2889
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,650
and you know

2890
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:23,090
at some point

2891
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,170
when steve is the only person in the room saying don't do it

2892
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,810
and there's good data from marketing saying this makes a lot of sense

2893
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:30,250
and everybody saying this makes a lot of sense

2894
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,530
he gets convinced

2895
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:32,090
yeah

2896
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:32,770
but it took a while

2897
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:34,330
so so culture

2898
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,250
i remember being kind of crest fall with steve

2899
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:40,489
i remember that the itunes product

2900
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:41,530
you know

2901
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:44,170
announcement and getting my 15 minutes and going in there

2902
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,730
and and steve had clearly gone such an entertainment direction

2903
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,290
he could see that that's the way the product was going to grow

2904
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,810
and i was still back in that camp of

2905
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,050
you know

2906
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,489
the computer is a bicycle for the mind

2907
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:55,610
and you know

2908
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,610
you know i wanted to see the next version of hypercard

2909
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,130
which was was dead

2910
01:29:59,159 --> 01:30:01,730
and he obviously understood what was happening in the world

2911
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,850
and i don't know

2912
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:08,050
do you understand that kind of d dichotomy that that the

2913
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:13,130
the pc was becoming an entertainment device or computing was becoming entertainment centric

2914
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,130
well

2915
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,369
you're probably talking now about the whole um digital hub strategy

2916
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:19,369
yeah

2917
01:30:19,560 --> 01:30:19,810
right

2918
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:20,330
photos

2919
01:30:20,679 --> 01:30:20,929
movies

2920
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:21,810
music

2921
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,770
all with computers at the center

2922
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:24,369
yeah

2923
01:30:24,379 --> 01:30:27,449
i mean that was just that was one of the things where steve was

2924
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:28,210
um

2925
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,810
really good at putting together a general message or a good message to explain why we're working

2926
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:33,530
we're working on

2927
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:34,489
and so you know

2928
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:35,489
why do you have fire wire

2929
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:36,210
you have fire wire

2930
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:36,770
so you can get fast

2931
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:38,170
io to a camcorder

2932
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:39,170
right

2933
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:43,090
and you know you have to have your music somewhere to sync it

2934
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:44,770
at least back then you had to sync from a computer

2935
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:47,130
and you want your photos to organize on your computer

2936
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,290
so it all makes sense

2937
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,050
as a nice package

2938
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:50,050
it could

2939
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:51,570
he could have come up with something else as well

2940
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,449
it just happens to be the one that he thought thought of

2941
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:55,690
based on the things that we were working on

2942
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,369
that all looked promising

2943
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:57,250
yeah

2944
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:58,250
yeah

2945
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:03,650
how much were you involved in in shepherding the development of itunes

2946
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:04,650
um

2947
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:05,929
i wasn't that involved in itunes

2948
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:06,489
itunes

2949
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:07,650
was

2950
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:08,650
uh

2951
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:08,810
done

2952
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:10,290
after we acquired

2953
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:11,170
um

2954
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:12,170
uh

2955
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:13,010
what was the name of the app

2956
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:13,969
sound

2957
01:31:13,979 --> 01:31:14,210
jam

2958
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:14,610
sound

2959
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:14,889
jam

2960
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,210
yeah

2961
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:15,650
sound jam

2962
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,690
and so we acquired sound jam

2963
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,650
and then that morphed itself into

2964
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:19,969
i

2965
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:20,810
right

2966
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:22,130
right

2967
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,130
um

2968
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,010
what

2969
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:24,210
what

2970
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:26,330
what led you to decide to leave

2971
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:27,330
okay

2972
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:38,290
so after after being the chief software technology officer for a little while

2973
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:39,290
um

2974
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:40,330
he was almost three

2975
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:40,770
wasn't it

2976
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:41,090
three years

2977
01:31:41,239 --> 01:31:42,210
it was close to three years

2978
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:42,449
maybe

2979
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:42,810
yeah

2980
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:43,449
so

2981
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,210
a while into that

2982
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:48,850
it was becoming frustrating for both me and for steve

2983
01:31:49,480 --> 01:31:57,130
and it was frustrating because i was there to offer my opinions on things

2984
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:02,969
and that was not good for steve because steve wanted to offer his opinions on things

2985
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:06,730
and so we'd go from review to review to review

2986
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:10,250
and he wanted it to be the steve jobs review show

2987
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,530
but i had my own ideas and sometimes we'd agree

2988
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:17,409
sometimes we'disagree or sometimes we just talk about different things that are completely complimentary

2989
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:20,449
and so there was this tension

2990
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:21,449
um

2991
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,969
and i like to to think of it in terms of

2992
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:24,330
of

2993
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:25,330
steve

2994
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:29,889
was never the kind of person that had a staff person working for him

2995
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,530
just kind of doing things to help him out

2996
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:32,330
was

2997
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:32,610
that was

2998
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:34,650
he was always hands-on um

2999
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,449
he wanted to be the person that knew all the functions and the only person knew all the functions

3000
01:32:40,679 --> 01:32:44,369
but if i'm now following him around a lot and i'm learning all the different functions too

3001
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,210
he's kind of giving up a little bit

3002
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:47,170
so it was kind of

3003
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,050
it was a little bit stressful for both of us

3004
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,850
and like we had known each other for so long that it was just

3005
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:52,969
it was kind of working

3006
01:32:53,719 --> 01:32:53,969
uh

3007
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:54,449
um

3008
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,610
but you know

3009
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:58,050
there was that

3010
01:32:58,199 --> 01:32:59,170
and there

3011
01:32:59,180 --> 01:32:59,929
this other

3012
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:01,369
unfortunate

3013
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:02,369
um

3014
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,210
mostly unfortunate thing where

3015
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:08,090
on the executive team

3016
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:13,050
i was the person that had the least responsibility by a large margin

3017
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,050
um

3018
01:33:14,199 --> 01:33:16,969
i didn't have any day-to-day product that i was worried about

3019
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,530
whereas everybody else around the table

3020
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:19,690
oh my god

3021
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:20,889
i got to get this thing done this week

3022
01:33:20,899 --> 01:33:21,770
or we're going to fail

3023
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:22,650
right

3024
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,369
or huge issues

3025
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:25,170
even illegal

3026
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,050
there were huge issues

3027
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,610
because every week there was a bunch of lawsuits right

3028
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:29,610
um

3029
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,570
and so i think you know no one

3030
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,050
no one actually complained to me

3031
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:40,449
but i think there was some back channel to steve that my job was too easy

3032
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:41,449
okay

3033
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:43,810
for still having that kind of a role

3034
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:50,090
and so for all these reasons we just kind of decided

3035
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:54,489
the best way to resolve this is for me to just quit leave the company

3036
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,010
because then all these issues go away and i'm adding some value to him

3037
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:02,409
but you know he's going to figure these things out for himself for the most part

3038
01:34:02,419 --> 01:34:02,610
anyway

3039
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:03,290
yeah

3040
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:03,570
right

3041
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,650
and so we just kind of mutually agreed that that was the best result

3042
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:07,650
um

3043
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,489
solved a lot of problems

3044
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:11,170
um

3045
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,170
in you haven't asked

3046
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:14,570
but i'll tell you in retrospect

3047
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:18,730
i think it was a huge mistake for both of us and

3048
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:19,570
um

3049
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:21,850
neither one of us could have known at the time

3050
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,489
of course

3051
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:23,489
um

3052
01:34:23,499 --> 01:34:24,850
but we probably should have

3053
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,250
and

3054
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:29,050
and i think it was a huge mistake for both of us because

3055
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:30,050
well

3056
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:30,850
for me

3057
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,889
i mean i left just before the main inflection point of the company having massive success

3058
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:36,889
okay

3059
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:42,330
and so part of me misses being there to experience that part of it

3060
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,010
having laid all the groundwork for it

3061
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:44,610
you know what i mean

3062
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:45,130
i do

3063
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,250
and and i balanced that against

3064
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:48,530
it was hard working there

3065
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:51,250
but having a similar role like that

3066
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:52,250
that would have worked well

3067
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,650
like like with other types of ceos

3068
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:56,290
maybe it would have been interesting

3069
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:57,290
okay

3070
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,130
so that that part was wrong for me

3071
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,650
and it was wrong for steve

3072
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,969
because i think he really lost something

3073
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:10,010
by not having me around to just bounce ideas off or get sanity checks on

3074
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:10,850
or whatever

3075
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,250
whether it's things going on in the market or things going on in the organization

3076
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:14,409
and especially

3077
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,449
as the years went on

3078
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,210
he became sicker and it was harder for him to do everything he wanted to do

3079
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:22,130
i think you know i could have helped out even more

3080
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:24,850
so i mean it didn't hurt the company at all

3081
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:26,369
it didn't really hurt me right

3082
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,250
um

3083
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:27,889
we

3084
01:35:27,899 --> 01:35:28,130
we're

3085
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:29,250
the company's fine

3086
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:29,889
i'm fine

3087
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,170
but in retrospect

3088
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,090
i do think it was a mistake for both of us

3089
01:35:33,100 --> 01:35:33,330
yet

3090
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,330
because of who we were

3091
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,250
it was just hard to make it work

3092
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,969
did you ever have a chance to have the conversation with him

3093
01:35:38,979 --> 01:35:41,050
that conversation with him after never

3094
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:41,449
never

3095
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:41,770
never

3096
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:42,210
no

3097
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:42,409
never

3098
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:43,969
and when you left

3099
01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:47,850
did you have a clear idea of what you would do after leaving

3100
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:48,850
um

3101
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,489
when i left i assumed i just going to retire

3102
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:52,130
which is basically what i did

3103
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:52,610
yeah

3104
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:53,090
yeah

3105
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:53,570
okay

3106
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,170
you know

3107
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:59,369
i thought maybe there was a chance that i would take on another operating job

3108
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:03,330
maybe as a ceo of a midsize company

3109
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,650
that would take a chance on me as a ceo

3110
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:06,650
um

3111
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:11,570
but i also knew that it would have to be something really exciting to want to take it

3112
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:12,010
yeah

3113
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:16,290
because you know there's no amount of money they could have offered me to make me want to take it

3114
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:18,170
so have to be something i really want to do

3115
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:23,850
and i i really enjoyed not being in a situation of those n9 to5 meetings

3116
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:25,170
under the gun

3117
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:25,850
to ship a product

3118
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:26,570
all the time

3119
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:27,369
you know

3120
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,969
people always complaining to you about who knows what

3121
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:30,650
yeah

3122
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:34,449
did you get a lot of offers for the kind of jobs you didn't want to do

3123
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:35,449
uh

3124
01:36:35,459 --> 01:36:35,690
no

3125
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:36,409
not really

3126
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:36,850
yeah

3127
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:37,290
no

3128
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:37,730
interesting

3129
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:39,570
because you're the l

3130
01:36:39,639 --> 01:36:39,889
i'm

3131
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:44,210
i'm surprised because you have a set of talents that is kind of unique in the valley

3132
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:45,170
well

3133
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:45,850
it's

3134
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,969
it's probably the case that

3135
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:48,969
um

3136
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,130
i never

3137
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:52,969
lots of recruiters called and i never return the calls

3138
01:36:53,199 --> 01:36:53,449
okay

3139
01:36:53,459 --> 01:36:57,010
so so that answers the question

3140
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:57,770
yeah

3141
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:57,929
there

3142
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:58,330
there was

3143
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:58,650
probably

3144
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:00,969
i mean there were definitely ct

3145
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:04,969
many cto type jobs out there where there'd be some cryptic message

3146
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,770
from a recruiter which i would just delete

3147
01:37:07,159 --> 01:37:07,409
yeah

3148
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:07,850
many

3149
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:08,570
many of those

3150
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:09,570
i mean i did do some boards

3151
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:10,530
i still do some boards

3152
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:11,969
that's a different kind of thing

3153
01:37:11,979 --> 01:37:13,929
that's a a more natural thing to do

3154
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:14,770
but never

3155
01:37:16,239 --> 01:37:16,489
really

3156
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:18,050
i mean there were

3157
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:20,489
come be cto of this huge company

3158
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:21,210
i'm like

3159
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:22,770
i have no interest in doing that at all

3160
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:23,170
yeah

3161
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,250
yeah

3162
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:26,090
so i don't even consider that to be an offer

3163
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:26,929
i never got

3164
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,130
nothing ever got to that stage

3165
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:28,810
i'm

3166
01:37:29,159 --> 01:37:30,409
i'm conf

3167
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:31,409
confused on timing

3168
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:32,210
were you gone

3169
01:37:32,679 --> 01:37:32,929
um

3170
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:33,210
both

3171
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:34,570
before the stock option

3172
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:35,530
um

3173
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:36,210
controversy

3174
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,929
and were you gone before steve got sick

3175
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:42,530
so um

3176
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:47,610
i was gone before the stock option controversy

3177
01:37:48,360 --> 01:37:48,610
um

3178
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:49,969
but i was there when he was sick

3179
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:50,610
yeah

3180
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:51,170
sorry

3181
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:51,770
okay

3182
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:52,690
yeah

3183
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,130
and did i mean

3184
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:56,770
to what extent

3185
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:57,650
did you know

3186
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:01,730
did sometimes people cut off people when they leave

3187
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,090
did steve and you keep a relationship and did it get minimal

3188
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:06,090
um

3189
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:14,050
his general mo was that he spent his time with people who were useful to him at the time

3190
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,250
and so i became not useful to him

3191
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:17,570
yeah

3192
01:38:17,719 --> 01:38:20,210
and so i mean

3193
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:21,130
if i ran into him

3194
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:21,570
he would be friendly

3195
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:22,210
in fact

3196
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:23,210
i think

3197
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:26,210
like month later i ran into him on a beach in hawaii

3198
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,010
we're both vacationing our families at the same time

3199
01:38:29,599 --> 01:38:30,889
and he was fine and cordial

3200
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,050
and all that

3201
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,929
and if i were to send him an email on something

3202
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:35,530
he would respond

3203
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:36,290
yeah

3204
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:37,050
um

3205
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:41,010
but he really had no need for anything that i was doing at the time

3206
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:45,570
and there was not really any reason for me to contact him

3207
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:46,170
yeah

3208
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:47,409
at least not all that much

3209
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:47,929
yeah

3210
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:52,170
and so we just kind of didn't keep in contact that much at the end of his life

3211
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:52,889
when he got very sick

3212
01:38:52,899 --> 01:38:55,130
did you guys have have any contact

3213
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:56,130
no

3214
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:56,810
not really

3215
01:38:57,080 --> 01:38:57,330
yeah

3216
01:38:57,639 --> 01:38:57,889
no

3217
01:38:58,639 --> 01:38:59,810
and you know

3218
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:00,810
i

3219
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,449
i wish i had known just how sick he was like the month before

3220
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,330
because then i would have initiated something

3221
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:07,530
but i didn't

3222
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:08,210
yeah

3223
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:13,010
and the that you know when he sort of threw fred under the bus and all of that did

3224
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:13,570
did

3225
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:15,610
i mean you were

3226
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:16,770
let's see

3227
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:17,050
let's see

3228
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:17,730
you became a partner

3229
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,849
fred's after that

3230
01:39:18,859 --> 01:39:19,130
is that

3231
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:19,290
right

3232
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:19,610
yes

3233
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:20,010
yeah

3234
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:20,969
so

3235
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:24,250
at the time i didn't really know many of the facts of what had gone on

3236
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,290
i i knew some of them

3237
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:29,050
obviously i was personally on the receiving end of some of the things

3238
01:39:29,060 --> 01:39:30,969
and i kind of knew what had happened there

3239
01:39:30,979 --> 01:39:32,530
and i'm just kind of reading what's in the press

3240
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:33,130
yeah

3241
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,050
um

3242
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:36,650
but you know

3243
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:37,530
look

3244
01:39:37,719 --> 01:39:40,849
i did not like seeing what happened to fred

3245
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:41,849
um

3246
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,929
but i really couldn't evaluate much of anything

3247
01:39:44,599 --> 01:39:45,130
at the time

3248
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:45,369
anyway

3249
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:46,050
yeah

3250
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,250
yeah

3251
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:48,250
um

3252
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,969
would you just tell us a little bit of the story of elevation

3253
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:51,929
um

3254
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:52,290
how

3255
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:53,130
how did it come to happen

3256
01:39:54,199 --> 01:39:54,449
yeah

3257
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:54,730
so

3258
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:55,489
um

3259
01:39:55,499 --> 01:39:57,290
fred anderson is one of the founders

3260
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:00,050
and so i knew fred very well

3261
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:00,369
of course

3262
01:40:00,379 --> 01:40:02,969
having worked with him at apple for many years very closely

3263
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:04,730
we become great friends

3264
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:05,730
and

3265
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:06,330
uh

3266
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:08,849
they founded their fund in i think 2006

3267
01:40:09,599 --> 01:40:11,610
and i was an lp in the fund

3268
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:15,290
and so i got to know all the other partners

3269
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:16,290
um

3270
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:16,730
you know

3271
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:16,889
roger

3272
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:17,170
mamy

3273
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:17,810
bono

3274
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:19,969
mark bodnick and the others

3275
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:21,050
um

3276
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:24,369
and so

3277
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,489
around the end of 2009

3278
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:32,530
they asked me if i wanted to join them as an investor and i thought about it

3279
01:40:32,540 --> 01:40:32,849
and i

3280
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:33,570
and it's like

3281
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:34,090
actually

3282
01:40:34,119 --> 01:40:34,770
this is perfect

3283
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,690
because in my quote retirement

3284
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:40,530
i've been doing angel investing but not a lot of it

3285
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:41,770
because as an engineer

3286
01:40:42,199 --> 01:40:44,810
i can find everything wrong with every business plan instantly

3287
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:45,810
okay

3288
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:49,170
so i can find every reason not to invest in a company without thinking very hard at all

3289
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:51,449
so i wouldn't invest in very many companies

3290
01:40:52,199 --> 01:40:52,449
and

3291
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:53,050
uh

3292
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:55,170
and i found it to be somewhat of a lonely thing

3293
01:40:55,239 --> 01:40:56,130
because it was just me

3294
01:40:56,140 --> 01:41:00,969
and i'd have to meet entrepreneurs who didn't have offices and coffee shops was kind of weird

3295
01:41:01,159 --> 01:41:01,409
yeah

3296
01:41:01,419 --> 01:41:01,849
and i'm like

3297
01:41:01,859 --> 01:41:02,010
oh

3298
01:41:02,020 --> 01:41:02,449
this is great

3299
01:41:02,459 --> 01:41:04,010
you guys have a big fund you do big investments

3300
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,570
the whole investment team love to join you and keep investing

3301
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:07,929
and so i did

3302
01:41:08,119 --> 01:41:08,969
and and so we did

3303
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:12,170
and did you get an area of responsibility in terms of the

3304
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:12,889
you know

3305
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,489
the technologies or the industry

3306
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,170
or was it all

3307
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:15,610
was it all

3308
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,929
was it not that structured

3309
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:18,409
completely unstructured

3310
01:41:19,159 --> 01:41:19,409
um

3311
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:21,690
but obviously i was the technology expert

3312
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:22,290
and so

3313
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,330
whenever someone wondered is this likely to work

3314
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:26,570
i would say yes or no

3315
01:41:26,580 --> 01:41:27,849
or try and figure it out

3316
01:41:28,599 --> 01:41:32,090
i i've known roger mamy in many roles over a long period of time

3317
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:33,849
he must have been an interesting partner to have

3318
01:41:34,280 --> 01:41:34,530
yes

3319
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:35,409
yes

3320
01:41:35,419 --> 01:41:35,610
love

3321
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:35,849
roger

3322
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:37,050
he's a

3323
01:41:37,060 --> 01:41:37,770
he's a character

3324
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:38,650
interesting

3325
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:39,530
i have a question

3326
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,050
um

3327
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:44,010
did you ever consider starting a new company a startup

3328
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:47,489
so i did start a startup

3329
01:41:48,239 --> 01:41:48,489
funny

3330
01:41:48,599 --> 01:41:49,810
you should ask that

3331
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:51,010
um

3332
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:52,010
and

3333
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:52,489
uh

3334
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:54,290
so i started started a startup

3335
01:41:55,040 --> 01:41:56,090
which failed

3336
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:57,690
because it

3337
01:41:58,040 --> 01:41:58,290
was

3338
01:41:59,040 --> 01:41:59,409
it was

3339
01:41:59,419 --> 01:42:00,610
ahead of its time

3340
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:01,610
um

3341
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:02,969
i started a company

3342
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:05,810
that was this idea

3343
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:11,770
the idea was to use um crowdsourcing to predict the stock market

3344
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:13,810
and so the idea is

3345
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:18,929
the idea was if you could get lots of consumers to come to your website

3346
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:22,210
and to tell you what they think about various companies

3347
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,369
then you can predict the future stock price

3348
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:26,409
so

3349
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:27,409
uh

3350
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:27,929
consider

3351
01:42:28,679 --> 01:42:28,929
if

3352
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:29,530
uh

3353
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:30,889
let's just use apple as an example

3354
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:35,570
if people start basically sentiment analysis if people are feeling good about apple

3355
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,810
because you're seeing a lot of people at apple stores

3356
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,050
then that's going to be a predictor of good earnings

3357
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,570
which is a predictor of the stock price going up

3358
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:48,849
and so you would try to attract people to the website to get them to basically give you their sentiment

3359
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:49,610
voting up

3360
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,170
voting down

3361
01:42:50,199 --> 01:42:50,810
if you will

3362
01:42:51,560 --> 01:42:52,610
consumer type companies

3363
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:56,290
and if you could collect enough data and you could data mine that

3364
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,369
so it's crowd sourcing and big data

3365
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:01,090
getting all the keywords in here in a crowd-based platform

3366
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:02,090
right

3367
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:02,770
cloud-based platform

3368
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,650
you could now predict the stock market

3369
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:09,210
but it preceded social networking and everything else

3370
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:09,969
and so

3371
01:43:10,679 --> 01:43:12,369
just as we were starting to run out of funding

3372
01:43:12,679 --> 01:43:14,449
facebook started becoming interesting

3373
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,929
and this would have been a great tie into facebook

3374
01:43:17,599 --> 01:43:19,050
where you're now sharing your thoughts

3375
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,810
and getting other people to participate

3376
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,210
and give their thoughts and have it you a certain amount of verality to it

3377
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:26,409
but you know

3378
01:43:26,419 --> 01:43:28,050
we gave up on the idea and folded the company

3379
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:29,530
so it it was a learning experience

3380
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,489
did you come to market or did you not get

3381
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,369
we had a website that was up and running

3382
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:34,610
so it was working

3383
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,969
we never got a lot of traction

3384
01:43:36,199 --> 01:43:37,050
what was the company called

3385
01:43:37,239 --> 01:43:40,130
it was called pick them

3386
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:42,050
and what year was that

3387
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:43,050
uh

3388
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:49,570
this would have been we probably started in 2007

3389
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:50,570
uh

3390
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,409
and we probably closed it down in 2009 or so

3391
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:55,449
something like that

3392
01:43:55,639 --> 01:43:55,889
yeah

3393
01:43:56,199 --> 01:43:57,170
somewhere around then

3394
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:58,170
c

3395
01:43:58,180 --> 01:43:59,330
can you give us your thoughts about

3396
01:43:59,599 --> 01:43:59,849
uh

3397
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:01,010
tim cook as the

3398
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:01,330
you know

3399
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:04,050
the leader of apple and sort of you know what your

3400
01:44:04,199 --> 01:44:05,570
your perspective on tim is

3401
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:06,489
yeah

3402
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:06,770
so

3403
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:07,530
uh

3404
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:07,929
first of all

3405
01:44:07,939 --> 01:44:11,969
i consider tim to be a friend and i think he's just a tremendous individual

3406
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:14,250
i think he has

3407
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:15,250
um

3408
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:19,449
really stepped up into the new role that he has as ceo

3409
01:44:20,199 --> 01:44:20,449
and

3410
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:21,210
um

3411
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:23,570
i've seen him grow a lot from when i knew him as a coo

3412
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,690
in terms of the kinds of things he does

3413
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:27,849
i think

3414
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:28,650
um

3415
01:44:29,199 --> 01:44:31,330
what else do i think

3416
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:32,330
um

3417
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:33,050
you know

3418
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:34,849
i think he's got an incredibly difficult job

3419
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:35,770
um

3420
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,330
running this huge company and trying to

3421
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:40,730
you know

3422
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:41,730
his

3423
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,570
his background in operations

3424
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,330
i think is very useful

3425
01:44:45,639 --> 01:44:48,449
because they have to keep the trains running on time with

3426
01:44:48,459 --> 01:44:51,130
that kind of magnitude whenever they have a new product that comes out

3427
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:55,650
the scale at which it comes out is enormous and they can't afford mistakes

3428
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:56,650
um

3429
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,770
and i think under his leadership they've done a really good job of that

3430
01:45:00,199 --> 01:45:01,250
i think you know

3431
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,810
if i were to be critical at all and i hate to be critical of tim again

3432
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:04,330
he's a friend

3433
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,449
i think he's doing a great job

3434
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,210
i mean technology is not a strength right

3435
01:45:08,239 --> 01:45:09,010
and so

3436
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:10,969
um

3437
01:45:11,719 --> 01:45:19,650
there's probably some innovation that they're probably not keeping quite the same pace of innovation they otherwise would

3438
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,250
but what i like to say is they're staying ahead of the competition

3439
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,130
and that's the most important thing

3440
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:26,570
it's like staying ahead of the bear

3441
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,449
staying ahead of your friend when the bear is chasing you right

3442
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:32,130
so it doesn't matter how innovative they are

3443
01:45:32,199 --> 01:45:34,010
so long as they're ahead of the competition

3444
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:36,530
and i think they've done a great job at doing that

3445
01:45:37,360 --> 01:45:37,610
yeah

3446
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:38,610
um

3447
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:39,530
what about

3448
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:40,130
um

3449
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:40,690
your

3450
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,130
the

3451
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:42,810
your successors in

3452
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:43,610
um

3453
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:44,929
in leading soft

3454
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,489
for brron and scott

3455
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:48,650
and now craig fed

3456
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:49,650
so

3457
01:45:50,239 --> 01:45:50,489
uh

3458
01:45:50,679 --> 01:45:51,650
they're all friends of mine

3459
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:53,330
we all work together right next

3460
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:54,090
ironically

3461
01:45:54,840 --> 01:45:55,090
um

3462
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:57,210
all very different individuals

3463
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:02,369
i think they all have brought success to the job in a lot of different ways

3464
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:03,210
you know

3465
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:03,409
brron

3466
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:04,369
of course

3467
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,810
the techie of them all always worried about how the tech works

3468
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:11,290
less about the management parts of the job

3469
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:11,929
but again

3470
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,130
good enough to do it

3471
01:46:13,679 --> 01:46:14,090
i thought

3472
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,650
um

3473
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:17,330
scott was an incredible person

3474
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:18,130
incredible engineer

3475
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,130
incredible manager

3476
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,130
with

3477
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:20,849
you know

3478
01:46:21,599 --> 01:46:26,889
a couple of issues that caused him to not get along with everybody all the time

3479
01:46:27,639 --> 01:46:27,889
um

3480
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:31,130
and his style of management worked great

3481
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:32,050
working for steve jobs

3482
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,730
because steve was okay with conflict

3483
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:40,650
and steve would mediate conflict and kind of make sure everything was taken care of without steve there

3484
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:41,690
you know

3485
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:45,210
scott's style of management was not always going to work best

3486
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,170
even though i mean

3487
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,130
scott

3488
01:46:47,560 --> 01:46:50,250
very often would make the right call at the right time

3489
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:53,369
it was hard to see him ever making making a d callin

3490
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:53,889
i remember

3491
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:57,010
i mean i told scott many years before he got the job

3492
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:57,290
just

3493
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:58,210
you know

3494
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:59,290
work on a few things here

3495
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:00,250
getting along with people

3496
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:02,010
don't just manage up

3497
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:02,730
like you do with steve

3498
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:03,849
a few things like that

3499
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:06,010
and you're gonna have this job in a few years and he did

3500
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:10,210
and you know some of the things i tried to get him to improve on

3501
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:11,929
he didn't quite improve on enough

3502
01:47:12,679 --> 01:47:12,929
um

3503
01:47:12,939 --> 01:47:13,330
or else

3504
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:14,929
i think he'd still be there and be very successful

3505
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,170
but great guy overall

3506
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,570
and i think he's perfectly happy doing other things now

3507
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:20,810
anyway

3508
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:21,770
craig

3509
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:22,810
so craig

3510
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:23,690
um

3511
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:25,730
left and then came back

3512
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:26,730
um

3513
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:27,489
to take the job

3514
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,650
and i think the world of craig as well

3515
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:30,010
i think

3516
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:30,409
uh

3517
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:35,810
craig has a really good balance of understanding the technology and being a good manager

3518
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:38,570
maybe one of the better balances of all of them

3519
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:39,010
yeah

3520
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:40,170
trying to remember

3521
01:47:40,199 --> 01:47:40,449
now

3522
01:47:40,459 --> 01:47:40,929
did you ever

3523
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:41,730
you know

3524
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:44,610
craig gets up on stage and does demos and stuff

3525
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:45,130
did

3526
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:46,170
did you have that role

3527
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:46,650
did you

3528
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,610
did you do demos

3529
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:49,290
public

3530
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:50,290
um

3531
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:51,409
i did do some demos

3532
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:52,409
um

3533
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:56,570
so i would do them regularly at the wwc's

3534
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:57,570
yeah

3535
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:01,170
so they'd be a steve keynote and he'd invite me up for 5

3536
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:01,409
10

3537
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,130
15 minutes and do a demo with him

3538
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:04,130
um

3539
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:05,810
occasionally at a mac world

3540
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:06,810
um

3541
01:48:07,159 --> 01:48:07,570
you know

3542
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:08,090
over time

3543
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:13,090
those things kind of dwindled and steve tended to do most of them himself

3544
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:14,090
um

3545
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,090
but i i did do some of them

3546
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:15,369
yeah

3547
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:15,929
those

3548
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:16,610
those

3549
01:48:16,679 --> 01:48:16,929
as

3550
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:18,170
as he perfected that

3551
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:18,449
i mean

3552
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:18,969
you know

3553
01:48:18,979 --> 01:48:19,210
from

3554
01:48:19,599 --> 01:48:20,929
i mean it started in the early 80s

3555
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:23,570
but then it sort of ramped up and they became like rock concerts

3556
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:24,810
i mean they

3557
01:48:24,820 --> 01:48:25,090
i mean

3558
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:25,969
from from my perspective

3559
01:48:26,119 --> 01:48:27,610
it was like going to roide because it was a

3560
01:48:27,620 --> 01:48:28,010
it was a

3561
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:28,330
you know

3562
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:28,610
it was a

3563
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:30,610
it was a staged event that was

3564
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:31,130
you know

3565
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,210
there were even like the

3566
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:32,610
you know

3567
01:48:32,620 --> 01:48:34,889
there were people cheered at the same things

3568
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:39,690
one more thing became this kind of you know joke for a while and they were really quite amazing

3569
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,570
uh

3570
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:41,010
well

3571
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,330
you guys in the press made it that way

3572
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:42,969
right

3573
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,130
so i mean it was a

3574
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:46,170
it was a pr strategy

3575
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:48,090
which is you keep things secret

3576
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:50,969
you unveil it all at once in a big way

3577
01:48:51,719 --> 01:48:51,969
right

3578
01:48:51,979 --> 01:48:53,810
and then the press goes crazy over it

3579
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:56,610
you get tons and tons of media exposure

3580
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:57,530
right

3581
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:59,929
you've got a couple follow-up stories to go along with it

3582
01:49:00,679 --> 01:49:00,929
and

3583
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:01,650
um

3584
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,409
so it worked

3585
01:49:03,639 --> 01:49:04,010
it worked

3586
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:04,889
it was

3587
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:06,730
it was really quite remarkable

3588
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:07,730
um

3589
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,170
i will add

3590
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:12,369
it was also remarkable because the products were remarkable

3591
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,090
so it

3592
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,170
these weren't empty

3593
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:16,330
you know

3594
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:17,130
keynotes

3595
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:18,130
right

3596
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:22,650
i mean they were chalk full of really good stuff and you know

3597
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:24,010
no matter how staged it was

3598
01:49:24,040 --> 01:49:24,290
if

3599
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,489
if there was no beef there

3600
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:26,610
it wasn't going to work

3601
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:27,610
yeah

3602
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:28,330
there's plenty of beef

3603
01:49:29,159 --> 01:49:29,409
yeah

3604
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:33,010
was it stressful to give those keynotes

3605
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:34,330
um

3606
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:35,330
well

3607
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:35,810
you know

3608
01:49:36,199 --> 01:49:36,449
again

3609
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,290
my part in them was always small and so it wasn't that stressful

3610
01:49:39,719 --> 01:49:40,090
you know

3611
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:40,290
things

3612
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,170
we generally knew

3613
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:44,489
things were going to work you know the the

3614
01:49:45,239 --> 01:49:46,530
from the engineering perspective

3615
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:51,090
the most stressful part is just hoping and praying the demos work right

3616
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,849
because you're always showing something is not quite done

3617
01:49:54,599 --> 01:49:55,730
and you know

3618
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:59,210
if he veers off script and does something that wasn't expected and it doesn't work

3619
01:49:59,220 --> 01:49:59,730
oh my god

3620
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:00,210
that's horrible

3621
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,810
but the shows themselves were generally well planned

3622
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:06,889
well executed

3623
01:50:07,639 --> 01:50:08,810
and so they weren't stressful

3624
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:12,929
my part of it was a little stressful because you get up in front of a big crowd

3625
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,929
but i'done it enough that it was okay

3626
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:16,610
yeah

3627
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,889
you talked about that that that you know

3628
01:50:19,899 --> 01:50:21,090
trajectory of 16 years

3629
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:25,770
sort of developing product and this a hard question

3630
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,449
but but is there something you're most proud of

3631
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,810
i mean that you know

3632
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:30,489
really

3633
01:50:31,239 --> 01:50:31,610
you know

3634
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,929
you really take pride in from of of all the things you worked on

3635
01:50:35,960 --> 01:50:38,210
i mean if you had to

3636
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:38,650
boy

3637
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,449
that is a really hard question

3638
01:50:41,199 --> 01:50:44,889
because you know there's no one thing per se

3639
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:46,770
i guess if i had to answer

3640
01:50:47,480 --> 01:50:48,329
what i would say

3641
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,489
is that

3642
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:50,250
um

3643
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:54,369
when we

3644
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:57,329
it was sort of in that year or two after we joined apple

3645
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:03,329
where we just kind of set a new tone for the company

3646
01:51:04,079 --> 01:51:04,329
um

3647
01:51:04,339 --> 01:51:05,170
a new culture

3648
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:09,090
a new way of operating the whole company

3649
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:13,090
that led and still leads to massive success

3650
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:17,010
because i think those fundamental things which

3651
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:17,570
as you know

3652
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:20,250
apple's now trying to teach to incoming employees

3653
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:27,810
i think those are fundamental things that we put in place that are now surviving the test of time

3654
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:31,690
and continuing to make the company successful

3655
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:40,530
and and the really great thing about it is not only has it yielded a company that's successful

3656
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:44,010
but it's yielded huge improvements in technology for everybody

3657
01:51:44,760 --> 01:51:47,570
and i mean even if you don't use an iphone

3658
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:53,449
i mean android has copied so much of it right that it's everywhere now

3659
01:51:53,719 --> 01:51:53,969
yeah

3660
01:51:53,979 --> 01:51:54,210
and

3661
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:56,810
and so it's just mindboggling the impact

3662
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:01,489
that that sort of our changes in those couple of years have had

3663
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:06,170
even though in those years we weren't thinking about a phone or anything that people have today

3664
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:07,650
you really did

3665
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:09,810
i mean those up until you know you

3666
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:10,449
you were almost there

3667
01:52:10,459 --> 01:52:11,329
till the iphone was introduced

3668
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:14,090
i was designing the technology that made that

3669
01:52:14,679 --> 01:52:15,170
i would argue

3670
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:17,090
made that leap to the rest of the population

3671
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:18,090
right

3672
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:18,610
i mean it was

3673
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:19,170
it was

3674
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:20,050
you know

3675
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:20,849
it was off the desktop

3676
01:52:21,079 --> 01:52:23,849
but it hadn't gotten out where every everybody in the world could use the technology

3677
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:24,889
now we're at that point

3678
01:52:25,159 --> 01:52:25,610
that's right

3679
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:27,409
with everybody connected all the time

3680
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:27,770
yeah

3681
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:28,449
yeah

3682
01:52:29,719 --> 01:52:29,969
yeah

3683
01:52:30,719 --> 01:52:30,969
um

3684
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:31,929
but

3685
01:52:32,040 --> 01:52:32,290
yeah

3686
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,449
what do you think is critical about about

3687
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:41,090
that culture that that you set up there at that time that persists to this day

3688
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,290
and that will carry apple forward

3689
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:47,530
um

3690
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:48,530
like

3691
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:49,130
what's the difference

3692
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,650
what's the apple difference

3693
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:57,690
i think i think what we did

3694
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,570
which m certainly made the difference then

3695
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:09,010
and i think continues to make the difference now is this focus on exemplary technology

3696
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:12,849
which means you get exemplary products

3697
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:19,969
by having exemplary people who focus on getting things done and getting things out

3698
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:21,170
and

3699
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,170
um

3700
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,770
you can kind of break any of those and you don't get success right

3701
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:29,449
or you don't

3702
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:29,770
you

3703
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:30,449
if you don't have great people

3704
01:53:30,459 --> 01:53:31,369
you don't get great technology

3705
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:35,250
you don't get great products and you can have great people and great technology

3706
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,810
but if you don't finish them and ship them

3707
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:39,489
it still doesn't do any good right

3708
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:40,849
so you kind of need all these things

3709
01:53:40,859 --> 01:53:43,449
and these are the things that we really instilled on everybody

3710
01:53:44,239 --> 01:53:44,489
um

3711
01:53:45,239 --> 01:53:48,929
and you know there's other things like everybody working toward the same goal and stuff like that

3712
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:50,889
which you know

3713
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:52,929
really kind of ties it all all together

3714
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:56,849
but i think those are sort of the core things that we really instilled in everybody

3715
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:57,690
which is

3716
01:53:58,440 --> 01:53:58,849
you know

3717
01:53:58,859 --> 01:54:01,250
our value here is

3718
01:54:01,599 --> 01:54:03,250
this isn't really a value statement per se

3719
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:03,570
but our

3720
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:09,210
our value is to create an excellent product that people can really use

3721
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:10,170
which means

3722
01:54:10,180 --> 01:54:10,969
you got to get it out there

3723
01:54:10,979 --> 01:54:13,010
you got to have the channels for it for it's not just the product

3724
01:54:13,079 --> 01:54:13,610
it's the channels

3725
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:14,290
it's the marketing

3726
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:15,329
it's everything

3727
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:16,010
it's

3728
01:54:16,040 --> 01:54:17,210
it's a whole thing

3729
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:17,730
it's

3730
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,250
it's the unboxing experience

3731
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:22,449
so that people feel good about what they just purchased right

3732
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:22,730
right

3733
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:23,849
um

3734
01:54:24,599 --> 01:54:32,090
and that's sort of a a culture that we really put in place and held everybody toward those goals

3735
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:35,770
how important is secrecy to that culture

3736
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:36,770
um

3737
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:37,010
you know

3738
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:43,010
secrecy is on a completely different axis and secrecy is about

3739
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:44,810
um

3740
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:49,290
it's partly about not allowing current products to be killed

3741
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:50,090
right

3742
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:50,290
osborne

3743
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:50,770
effect

3744
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:51,770
we don't want that obviously

3745
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:54,090
and it's partly about

3746
01:54:54,840 --> 01:54:55,090
um

3747
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:57,650
making sure the competition doesn't see what you're doing

3748
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:01,250
so they somehow steal your thunder and who knows what way

3749
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:02,250
uh

3750
01:55:02,260 --> 01:55:04,730
and it's also about we just talked about a little while ago

3751
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:06,250
having the big unveil

3752
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:07,250
okay

3753
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:13,050
where you've got this great thing that everybody's now seeing for the first time and every you know

3754
01:55:13,119 --> 01:55:16,010
a million people or more are live streaming it right

3755
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,610
10 million

3756
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:19,409
who knows what numbers they're live streaming to find out what's next

3757
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:21,730
and secrecy gives you all of those things

3758
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:22,250
yeah

3759
01:55:22,599 --> 01:55:22,849
yeah

3760
01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:24,730
secrecy does come at a cost

3761
01:55:25,480 --> 01:55:26,170
but generally

3762
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,650
these things far outweigh those costs

3763
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:29,250
yeah

3764
01:55:29,719 --> 01:55:30,130
i'm watching

3765
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:30,889
um

3766
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:31,369
i don't

3767
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:33,250
tom guber came after you left

3768
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,130
but he's was one of the architects of siri

3769
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:36,650
and um

3770
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:39,290
is someone i've known for a long time

3771
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:41,489
and i'm watching him struggle in that framework

3772
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:45,889
and apple has sort of opened the door for him to get out just a little bit

3773
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,849
but i mean they're letting him talk at ted

3774
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:52,290
which is just extraordinary that you know that somebody would would let someone from apple do that

3775
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:52,570
cuz

3776
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:52,810
that was

3777
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:53,929
you know something wouldn't have happened

3778
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:54,369
but he's

3779
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:58,650
he's chafed at the you know that that system it worked very well

3780
01:55:59,320 --> 01:55:59,570
well

3781
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:02,770
you know something things require not being secret

3782
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:03,770
right

3783
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:07,090
and so secrecy is not one size fits all

3784
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:10,329
you have to kind of go with the flow and figure out what's going on

3785
01:56:10,339 --> 01:56:10,610
you know

3786
01:56:10,620 --> 01:56:11,489
if you're working on internet standards

3787
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:13,889
you can't be secret by definition

3788
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:14,730
yeah

3789
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:17,130
so there's a lot of different degrees there

3790
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,050
i have a steve question

3791
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:19,530
and

3792
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,130
and this is something i thought for some time

3793
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:24,730
and i was wondering if you could tell me if it's accurate

3794
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:25,130
you know

3795
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:27,690
steve's given credit for lots of different things

3796
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:29,090
and one of the things that i haven't seen

3797
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:33,449
stressed as much but i've always thought is over a long period of time

3798
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:35,810
he got the timing of technologies right

3799
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:37,929
in some ways that i almost thought was spooky

3800
01:56:38,159 --> 01:56:39,010
because you can be too early

3801
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:39,810
you can be too late

3802
01:56:40,159 --> 01:56:45,730
but he seemed to have some fifth sense for when a technology was rip for mass commercialization

3803
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:46,849
am i

3804
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:49,690
did you ever did it look like that to you at all

3805
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:50,650
well

3806
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,889
so i'm not even sure the premise of your statement is correct

3807
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:54,290
i mean

3808
01:56:54,300 --> 01:56:56,210
obviously the cube and next step were too early

3809
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,530
i know he made mistakes right

3810
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:58,050
so

3811
01:56:58,599 --> 01:57:00,290
and and yet i think this

3812
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:00,730
yeah

3813
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:01,730
i think one of our strengths

3814
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:02,730
um

3815
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:03,489
which you're attributing

3816
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:03,929
him

3817
01:57:03,939 --> 01:57:04,610
which is correct

3818
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:05,610
is

3819
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:07,770
um

3820
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:08,770
we

3821
01:57:09,119 --> 01:57:09,610
like i said

3822
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:09,849
we

3823
01:57:09,859 --> 01:57:12,090
we developed a prototype prototype tablet

3824
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:13,090
right

3825
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,849
but we elected not to ship it

3826
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:22,090
because we just projected out who's going to use this and the answer was nobody or maybe five people

3827
01:57:22,280 --> 01:57:24,650
when everyone else hold five tablets right

3828
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:27,449
so i think what he was good at

3829
01:57:27,459 --> 01:57:31,770
and what we were all good at was getting out of our tech skins

3830
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,210
and figuring out what is the world going to do with this thing

3831
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:35,210
okay

3832
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:35,889
and is it ready

3833
01:57:37,159 --> 01:57:39,690
and maybe it's not quite ready

3834
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:41,329
but in a year it'll be ready because we'll make it ready

3835
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:42,090
okay

3836
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:44,090
and so when we saw that

3837
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:46,210
we could get all the elements together for a phone

3838
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:47,610
it made sense

3839
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:47,810
and

3840
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:47,929
oh

3841
01:57:47,939 --> 01:57:48,290
by the way

3842
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:49,170
next came the tablet

3843
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:50,329
which now made sense

3844
01:57:50,339 --> 01:57:50,530
cu

3845
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:52,210
we had all this connectivity right

3846
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:55,409
and so so it was it

3847
01:57:55,419 --> 01:57:56,730
i'm not sure that it's that hard

3848
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:57,650
um

3849
01:57:58,119 --> 01:58:06,610
i think it's really about having the ability to again step out from your normal technological skin

3850
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:09,329
don't see things as an engineer or as a product person

3851
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:12,530
and see things as the masses are going to see them

3852
01:58:12,599 --> 01:58:14,290
and will they want them and can they use them

3853
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:14,730
yeah

3854
01:58:15,119 --> 01:58:18,690
but we clearly had technologies that were before their time

3855
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,250
that we didn't ship for that reason

3856
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,210
yeah

3857
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:22,210
um

3858
01:58:22,679 --> 01:58:23,329
for my end

3859
01:58:23,339 --> 01:58:23,530
maybe

3860
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:25,050
just one last question

3861
01:58:25,079 --> 01:58:28,730
have you ever considered a memoir

3862
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:30,130
i'm not a writer

3863
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:31,170
i'm not a writer

3864
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,849
i mean if someone came to me

3865
01:58:32,859 --> 01:58:33,730
and wanted to write a book

3866
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,650
and they just wanted to sit with me and i would tell them the story

3867
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:40,050
i would probably do that and they would sell 20 copies right

3868
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,610
but i can't see doing that myself

3869
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,050
yeah

3870
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,250
have you played with swift

3871
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:47,250
um

3872
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:48,810
just a little bit

3873
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:50,290
not very much

3874
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:51,889
what do you think of it

3875
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:52,969
um

3876
01:58:53,239 --> 01:59:00,170
my general impression is they have made a really important step forward

3877
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:01,170
um

3878
01:59:01,239 --> 01:59:02,690
it's going to be extremely successful

3879
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,690
they're making the right decisions with it

3880
01:59:05,199 --> 01:59:07,050
i think developers are falling in love with

3881
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:08,090
they're going to fall in love with it

3882
01:59:08,100 --> 01:59:11,409
it's a very positive thing for them to do

3883
01:59:12,159 --> 01:59:16,730
i was just wondering about your recent investing with um elevation

3884
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:21,210
and i guess now with next equity next equity

3885
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:21,690
yes

3886
01:59:22,199 --> 01:59:22,449
um

3887
01:59:22,639 --> 01:59:22,889
just

3888
01:59:22,899 --> 01:59:28,929
are you investing in software and where do you see the the software story going in the

3889
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:31,770
in the near and far terms

3890
01:59:32,520 --> 01:59:32,770
okay

3891
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:34,369
so let me talk about that

3892
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:34,690
so

3893
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:35,690
um

3894
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,489
next equity is the fund that we have right now

3895
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,810
which is in some form a successor to the elevation fund

3896
01:59:42,199 --> 01:59:43,329
but it's also a little bit different

3897
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:44,690
the partners are a little bit different

3898
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:45,690
uh

3899
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:47,409
and and the we don't do

3900
01:59:48,159 --> 01:59:50,610
we don't do checks quite as big as elevation used to do

3901
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:51,010
elevation

3902
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:51,449
right

3903
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,489
used to do checks in the hundreds of millions

3904
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:53,969
we do

3905
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:54,250
millions

3906
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:55,250
uh

3907
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:56,610
it's a much smaller fund where

3908
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:57,530
uh

3909
01:59:57,540 --> 01:59:58,610
just a small number of partners

3910
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,050
small

3911
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:03,530
much smaller fund and we're basically investing in anything that relates to technology

3912
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:04,770
we

3913
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:05,770
uh

3914
02:00:05,780 --> 02:00:06,050
you know

3915
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:09,610
we think technology touches everything these days

3916
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,889
and it means there's an interesting technology angle to lots of different types of companies

3917
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,409
and we look at them all

3918
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:17,050
we invest in the ones that we think are good businesses

3919
02:00:17,719 --> 02:00:18,570
and so for us

3920
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:19,369
the angle is

3921
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:20,810
do we think this is a good business

3922
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,409
have you had any exits yet

3923
02:00:24,419 --> 02:00:26,210
or is it really how we just started

3924
02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:29,570
we've not had any exits yet

3925
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:31,610
i guess my last question is

3926
02:00:31,719 --> 02:00:31,969
uh

3927
02:00:32,040 --> 02:00:32,969
what do you think is

3928
02:00:33,159 --> 02:00:33,409
uh

3929
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:36,090
apple's greatest challenge right now

3930
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:41,530
apple's greatest challenge is probably staying innovative

3931
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:43,090
given its size

3932
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,610
you know they've got a huge

3933
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:46,610
uh

3934
02:00:46,620 --> 02:00:48,010
installed base

3935
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:49,010
uh

3936
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:51,849
they have to worry about keeping that installed base moving forward

3937
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:56,090
which generally leans toward incremental changes that are slow

3938
02:00:56,760 --> 02:00:57,010
right

3939
02:00:57,020 --> 02:00:58,050
that's the tendency there

3940
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:00,010
but in the industry they serve

3941
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:01,969
you still need to have new innovations

3942
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:05,090
it doesn't mean they need to be whole new product categories

3943
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:07,250
but they need to be basic innovations

3944
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,130
even in in existing categories

3945
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:14,290
and so staying innovative is probably their long-term challenge

3946
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,290
so

3947
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,770
the last time that i saw steve was a visit that i paid with steven ley in may of

3948
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:21,210
was it

3949
02:01:21,220 --> 02:01:21,369
2011

3950
02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:23,969
so was about five months before

3951
02:01:24,119 --> 02:01:26,610
and one of the things he said that

3952
02:01:27,159 --> 02:01:27,409
um

3953
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:28,250
he

3954
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:28,969
he said that

3955
02:01:28,979 --> 02:01:29,170
you know

3956
02:01:29,180 --> 02:01:31,650
if i had enough energy i'd really like to take on detroit

3957
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:33,810
and that was very striking

3958
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:34,810
and i've often wondered

3959
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:35,610
i have no idea

3960
02:01:35,880 --> 02:01:36,409
because the

3961
02:01:36,419 --> 02:01:36,650
you know

3962
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:37,090
you saw

3963
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:39,730
they just got a a license for testing a prot

3964
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:40,290
you know

3965
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,889
i was wondering whether tim cook was sort of honoring steve's sort of

3966
02:01:45,239 --> 02:01:45,610
you know

3967
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:46,329
spirit

3968
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:50,570
or his interest in in starting a self-driving car company

3969
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:52,449
self-driving car project

3970
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:53,130
well

3971
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:53,329
i

3972
02:01:53,339 --> 02:01:57,810
i think at this point it's fair to say that tim would be pursuing things

3973
02:01:58,079 --> 02:01:59,690
assuming he thought they made sense to pursue

3974
02:02:00,199 --> 02:02:04,010
and he's on record as saying transportation is obviously a big industry

3975
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:07,730
which leads people to believe that they're working on something in that space

3976
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:08,969
exactly what it is

3977
02:02:09,159 --> 02:02:09,810
they won't say

3978
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:10,250
yeah

3979
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:11,090
yeah

3980
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,329
but i mean

3981
02:02:12,339 --> 02:02:15,730
look when your apple size to move the needle

3982
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:20,889
you want to look for big industries right where you can really again move the needle

3983
02:02:21,159 --> 02:02:21,409
yeah

3984
02:02:21,419 --> 02:02:22,570
and there's not a lot of them

3985
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:23,290
yeah

3986
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:24,290
yeah

3987
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:26,290
have you looked at flying cars at all

3988
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:27,290
you know

3989
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:29,530
never looked at flying cars

3990
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,369
i'love to have one

3991
02:02:32,119 --> 02:02:33,570
there are a bunch of startups around

3992
02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:38,449
i mean i just made a list of 14 flying car startups including air

3993
02:02:38,459 --> 02:02:39,050
including airbus

3994
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:40,290
it's of the largest

3995
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:46,210
but so that's

3996
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:47,409
that's from my end

3997
02:02:47,419 --> 02:02:47,810
that's great

3998
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:48,290
that's

3999
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,810
is there anything that we've missed

4000
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:51,650
that's always a good question

4001
02:02:51,960 --> 02:02:52,610
oh jee

4002
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:53,090
yeah

4003
02:02:53,159 --> 02:02:55,969
you know something something bur

4004
02:02:56,719 --> 02:02:56,969
well

4005
02:02:56,979 --> 02:02:57,610
as soon as you know

4006
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,690
5 minutes after we're done driving away

4007
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:00,369
i think of something

4008
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,090
oh my god

4009
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:02,969
weot to talk about this

4010
02:03:03,719 --> 02:03:03,969
um

4011
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:06,449
you know there's so much that that happened

4012
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:08,369
it could never will be covered

4013
02:03:09,079 --> 02:03:11,010
i think i think we covered most of the highlights

4014
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:13,210
we can always do another session if we have to

4015
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:13,610
yeah

4016
02:03:14,320 --> 02:03:14,570
great

4017
02:03:15,320 --> 02:03:15,730
i guess

4018
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,090
u

4019
02:03:16,560 --> 02:03:19,010
i don't know if this is something you'd be comfortable answering

4020
02:03:19,239 --> 02:03:20,889
but i i was just wondering

4021
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:22,250
you know

4022
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:23,409
the day that steve passed

4023
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:24,130
um

4024
02:03:24,199 --> 02:03:25,849
maybe what were your feelings

4025
02:03:27,239 --> 02:03:27,489
then

4026
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:29,090
um

4027
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,210
so i remember that day

4028
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:31,690
well

4029
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:33,610
because

4030
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:34,810
um

4031
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:41,809
that day i was taking my daughter to a volleyball practice

4032
02:03:42,960 --> 02:03:46,369
and just as we were walking into the gymnasium

4033
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:51,730
my iphone started beeping with phone calls and text messes

4034
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:53,489
messages all from the press

4035
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:54,489
oh

4036
02:03:54,760 --> 02:03:57,210
and so i knew exactly what had happened

4037
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,690
i didn't even have to look at any news or anything

4038
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:04,650
i knew what had happened instantly um

4039
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:06,210
and you know

4040
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:06,849
i mean

4041
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:07,849
look

4042
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,170
we all knew he was sick for many years

4043
02:04:10,920 --> 02:04:11,170
right

4044
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:11,849
um

4045
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:16,130
i knew very early on just how sick he was

4046
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:17,130
um

4047
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,090
and you know

4048
02:04:18,199 --> 02:04:18,449
i

4049
02:04:18,599 --> 02:04:20,130
even though i hadn't met with him person

4050
02:04:20,199 --> 02:04:24,929
i still talk to people who knew a good amount of what the situation was

4051
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:27,050
so it was like

4052
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:28,050
gee

4053
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,250
this is really sad

4054
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:30,130
but it finally happened

4055
02:04:30,760 --> 02:04:31,889
because you know

4056
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:33,929
in in some way

4057
02:04:34,679 --> 02:04:35,489
you all

4058
02:04:36,239 --> 02:04:39,650
we knew the situation was dire because of the disease

4059
02:04:40,400 --> 02:04:44,929
yet you always wanted to believe he would find a way to avoid the inevitable

4060
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:46,770
i think he believed that

4061
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:47,130
right

4062
02:04:47,239 --> 02:04:47,489
yeah

4063
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:48,170
and

4064
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:48,889
um

4065
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:52,050
but it was just sort of wow

4066
02:04:52,119 --> 02:04:52,929
this is really sad

4067
02:04:53,040 --> 02:05:00,570
and then i went in and watched my daughter's volleyball practice

4068
02:05:01,320 --> 02:05:01,570
well

4069
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,130
thank you very much

4070
02:05:02,679 --> 02:05:03,050
thank you

4071
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:03,730
my pleasure

4072
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:04,290
yeah
