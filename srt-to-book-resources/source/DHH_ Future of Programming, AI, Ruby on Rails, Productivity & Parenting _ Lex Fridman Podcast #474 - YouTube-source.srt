1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,150
- No one anywhere who's serious believes

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,485
that cookie banners does anything good for anyone,

3
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:07,313
yet we've been unable to get rid of it.

4
00:00:07,313 --> 00:00:08,940
This is the thing that really gets me

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,470
about cookie banners too.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,060
It's not just the EU.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,140
It's the entire world.

8
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,680
You can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet.

9
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,789
If you go to goddam Mars on one of Elon's rockets

10
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,200
and you try to access a webpage,

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,460
you'll still see a cookie banner.

12
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,520
No one in the universe is safe from this nonsense.

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,119
It sometimes feels like we're barely better off.

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,800
Like webpages aren't that different

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,073
from what they were in the late '90s, early 2000s.

16
00:00:34,073 --> 00:00:35,850
They're still just forms.

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,860
They still just right to databases.

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,870
A lot of people, I think, are very uncomfortable

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,408
with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys.

20
00:00:43,408 --> 00:00:45,690
They just make systems

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,920
that create read, update or delete row in a database,

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,240
and they have to compensate

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,240
for that existential dread by overcomplicating things.

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,254
That's a huge part of the satisfaction

25
00:00:58,254 --> 00:00:59,610
of driving a race car

26
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,790
is driving in at the edge of adhesion, as we call it.

27
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,500
Where you're essentially

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,570
just a tiny movement away from spinning out.

29
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,500
Doesn't take much,

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,820
then the car starts rotating.

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,290
Once it starts rotating,

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,173
you lose grip and you're going for the wall.

33
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:17,820
That balance of danger and skill

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,443
is what's so intoxicating.

35
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,250
- The following is a conversation

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,409
with David Heinemeier Hansson, also known as DHH.

37
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,088
He is a legend in the programming and tech world,

38
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:34,890
brilliant and insightful, sometimes controversial,

39
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,110
and always fun to talk to.

40
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,540
He's the creator of Ruby on Rails,

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,240
which is an influential web development framework

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,940
behind many websites used by millions of people,

43
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,290
including Shopify, GitHub, and Airbnb.

44
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,450
He is the co-owner and CTO

45
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,450
of 37signals that created Basecamp, HEY and ONCE.

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,003
He is a "New York Times" bestselling author,

47
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,010
together with his co-author,

48
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,357
Jason Fried of four books,

49
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,350
"Rework," "Remote," "Getting Real,"

50
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,013
and "It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work."

51
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:13,000
And on top of that, he's also a race car driver,

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,150
including being a class winner

53
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,121
at the legendary 24-hour Le Mans Race.

54
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:21,270

And now, dear friends, here's DHH.

59
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,730
For someone who became a legendary programmer,

60
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,030
you officially got into programming late in life,

61
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,450
and I guess that's because you tried

62
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,640
to learn how to program a few times and you failed.

63
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,900
So can you tell me the the full story, the saga

64
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,880
of your failures to learn programming?

65
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,775
Was Commodore 64 involved?

66
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:55,260
- Commodore 64 was the inspiration.

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,330
I really wanted a Commodore 64.

68
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,117
That was the first computer I ever sat down in front.

69
00:03:00,117 --> 00:03:01,740
And the way I sat down in front of it

70
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,270
was I was five years old

71
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,430
and there was this one kid on my street

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,020
who had a Commodore 64.

73
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,580
No one else had a computer,

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,400
so we were all the kids just getting over there

75
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,440
and we were all playing "Yie Ar Kung-Fu."

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,273
I dunno if you've ever seen that game.

77
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:16,590
It was one of the original fighting games.

78
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,423
It's really a great game.

79
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,110
And I was playing that for the first time

80
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,310
at five years old.

81
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,900
And we were like seven kids

82
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,318
sitting up in this one kid's bedroom,

83
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,360
all taking our turn to play the game.

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,780
And I just found that unbelievably interesting.

85
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,750
And I begged and I begged and I begged my dad,

86
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,730
could I get a computer?

87
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,407
And he finally comes home.

88
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:38,490
He's like, "I got your computer."

89
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,000
I was like, yes, my own Commodore 64.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And he pulls out this black green and blue keyboard.

91
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,643
That's an Amstrad 464.

92
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:52,383
I was like, dad, what's this?

93
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,840
- The disappointment.

94
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,540
- This is not a Commodore 64.

95
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,830
But it was a computer.

96
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,180
So I got my first computer at essentially six years old

97
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,890
that Amstrad 464.

98
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,493
And of course, the first thing I wanted to do,

99
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:07,800
I wanted to play video games.

100
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,710
And I think the computer, which he by the way,

101
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,730
had traded for TV and a stereo recorder

102
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,660
or something like that.

103
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,829
Came with like two games.

104
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,329
One was this "Frogger" game

105
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,760
where you had to escape from underground.

106
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,050
It was actually kind of dark.

107
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,070
Like this frog, you're trying

108
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,861
to get it out from underground.

109
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:25,977
And I was pretty bad at it.

110
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:27,390
And I only had those two games.

111
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,730
And then I wanted more games.

112
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,370
And one way to get more games

113
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,990
when you're a kid who don't have a lot of money,

114
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,220
I can't just buy a bunch of games,

115
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,650
is to type them in yourself.

116
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,046
Back in '84, '85,

117
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,590
magazines would literally print source code

118
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,360
at the back of their magazines

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,693
and you could just sit and type it in. So I tried to do that

120
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:49,890
and it would take like two hours

121
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,460
to print this game into the Amstrad.

122
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,310
And of course I'd make some spelling mistake along the way

123
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,480
and something wouldn't work,

124
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,890
and the whole thing.

125
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,240
I wasn't that good of English.

126
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,890
I was born in Denmark.

127
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,260
So I was really trying to get into it

128
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,353
because I wanted all these games.

129
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:07,200
I didn't have the money to buy 'em.

130
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,140
And I tried quite hard for quite a while to get into it,

131
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,220
but it just never clicked.

132
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,190
And then I discovered the magic of piracy.

133
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,109
And after that I kind of basically just took some time off

134
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,870
from learning to program

135
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,730
because, well, now suddenly

136
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,484
I had access to all sorts of games.

137
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:24,120
So that was the first attempt,

138
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,910
like around six, seven years old.

139
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,450
And what's funny is I remember these fragments.

140
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,036
I remember not understanding the purpose of a variable.

141
00:05:34,036 --> 00:05:36,000
If there's a thing and you sign something,

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,620
why would you assign another thing to it?

143
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,110
So for some reason, I understand it constants.

144
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,350
A constants made sense to me, but variables didn't.

145
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,522
Then maybe I'm 11 to 12,

146
00:05:45,522 --> 00:05:48,480
I've gotten into the Amiga at this point.

147
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,950
The Amiga, by the way,

148
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,070
still perhaps my favorite computer of all time.

149
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,120
I mean, this is one of those things

150
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,443
where you're like, people get older and they're like,

151
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:57,840
"Oh, the music from the '80s amazing."

152
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,117
To me, even as someone who loves computers,

153
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:01,620
who loved new computers,

154
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,790
the Amiga was this magical machine

155
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,730
that was made by the same company

156
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,410
that produced the Commodore 64.

157
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,410
And I got the Amiga 500, I think in '87.

158
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,460
- Look at this sexy thing

159
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,073
that is a sexy machine right there.

160
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:21,240
- This is from an age by the way,

161
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,967
where computing wasn't global in the same sense.

162
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,440
The different territories

163
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,300
had different computers that were popular.

164
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,430
The Amiga was really popular in Europe,

165
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,560
but it wasn't very popular at all in the US

166
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,380
as far as I understand it. It wasn't popular in Japan.

167
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,820
There were just different machines.

168
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,550
The Apple II was a big thing in the US.

169
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,260
I'd never even heard of Apple

170
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,570
in the '80s in Copenhagen.

171
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,520
But the Amiga 500 was the machine

172
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,868
that brought me to want to try it again.

173
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:47,997
And you know what's funny?

174
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:49,950
The reason I wanted to try it again

175
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,977
was I remembered the first time to learn.

176
00:06:51,977 --> 00:06:54,000
And then there was this programming language

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,313
that was literally called EasyAMOS,

178
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,160
like the easy version of AMOS.

179
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,976
I'm like, if it's EasyAMOS, how hard can it be?

180
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:04,830
I gotta be able to figure this out.

181
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:07,170
And this time I tried harder.

182
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,850
I got into conditionals,

183
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,467
I got into loops, I got into all these things

184
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,603
and I still, I couldn't do it.

185
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:15,810
And on the second attempt,

186
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,280
I really got to the point of like,

187
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,530
maybe I'm not smart enough,

188
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,760
maybe programming is just not for me,

189
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,280
maybe it's too much math.

190
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,010
Like I like math in this sort of superficial way.

191
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,750
I don't like it in the deep way.

192
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,540
That's some on my perhaps slightly nerdier friends did

193
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,983
who I had tremendous respect for.

194
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,290
Like I'm not that person.

195
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,705
I'm not the math geek who's gonna figure it all out.

196
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:42,240
So after that attempt with EasyAMOS

197
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,892
and failing to even get, I don't even think

198
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:47,640
I completed one even very basic game.

199
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,530
I thought the program's just not for me.

200
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,700
I'm gonna have to do something else.

201
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,930
I still love computers.

202
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,760
I still love video games.

203
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,220
I actually at that time had already begun making friends

204
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,660
with people who knew how to program,

205
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,730
who weren't even programming EasyAMOS.

206
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,010
They were programming freaking assembler.

207
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,880
And I would sit down and just go, how do you,

208
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,220
the moves and the memories and the copies,

209
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,053
how do you even do this?

210
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:12,357
I don't even understand how you go from this

211
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:14,910
to Amiga demos, for example.

212
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,050
That was the big thing with the Amiga.

213
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,483
It had this wonderful demo scene in Europe.

214
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,675
It's this really interesting period of time

215
00:08:22,675 --> 00:08:24,660
in Amiga's history

216
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,830
where you had all these programmers

217
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,780
spread out mostly all over Europe

218
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,780
who would compete on graphic competitions,

219
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,020
where you could probably bring

220
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,750
one of these different... - On that thing?

221
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,582
- On this thing,

222
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:41,070
they would make these little almost like music videos,

223
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:44,430
combining some midi music, combining some cool graphics.

224
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,180
And they would do all of it in like 4K, four kilobytes.

225
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,370
That is not 4Ks of revolution,

226
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,620
four kilobytes of memory.

227
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,570
And I just thought that was such a cool scene.

228
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,838
This was obviously pre-internet.

229
00:08:56,838 --> 00:09:00,990
It was even pre BBS, bulletin board systems

230
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,070
to some extent.

231
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,914
It was you swap your demo software with someone else

232
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:10,914
by sending them a disk in the mail, like the 3.5s.

233
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,620
And I was enamored with that whole scene.

234
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,540
I was enamored with what they were able to create

235
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,100
and I just wanted to be a part of it

236
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,460
even though I kind of didn't have any skills to contribute.

237
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,860
And that's how I got into running BBSs.

238
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,900
I didn't learn programming then

239
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,210
and I wouldn't learn programming until much later,

240
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,280
until I was almost 20 years old.

241
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,010
The bulletin board systems existed in this funny space

242
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,947
where they were partly a service to the demo scenes

243
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:37,380
allowing all these demo groups

244
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,440
to distribute their amazing demos.

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,670
And then it was also a place

246
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,667
to trade piracy software, pirated software.

247
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,650
And I ended up starting one of those

248
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:48,840
when I was 14 years old

249
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,150
in my tiny little bedroom in Copenhagen.

250
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,180
I had my, at that point, Amiga 4000.

251
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,180
I had three telephone lines coming in into my tiny room.

252
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:00,660
- [Lex] Nice.

253
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,760
- Which is funny because again, I'm 14 years old.

254
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,160
By the time I was in Sterling, my third line,

255
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,870
you had to get someone from the telephone company

256
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,920
to come do it.

257
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,267
I get this guy and he's just looking around like,

258
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:11,520
"What is this?

259
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,537
Why the hell is a 14-year-old

260
00:10:13,537 --> 00:10:16,676
having three phone lines into their tiny little bedroom?

261
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:18,780
What's going on here?

262
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,440
Why are all these modems blinking red and black

263
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,790
and making funny sounds?"

264
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,780
- Did your parents know?

265
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,210
- They did and they didn't.

266
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,680
They knew I had the phone lines.

267
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,090
They knew I had the computer.

268
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,680
I don't think they really understood

269
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,930
that I was trading pirated software

270
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,340
that was both illegal, and whatever else was going on.

271
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,140
- Oh, we should probably say that in Europe,

272
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,760
maybe you can comment on this

273
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,100
in, especially in Eastern Europe, but Europe in general,

274
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,620
piracy I think was more acceptable

275
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,450
than it was in the United States.

276
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,007
I don't know there maybe it's just my upbringing.

277
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,910
- Even that conversation wasn't present.

278
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,610
I never spoke to anyone growing up in Denmark.

279
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,470
- The piracy is wrong. - Had any moral qualms

280
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,162
whatsoever about piracy.

281
00:11:00,162 --> 00:11:04,080
It was just completely accepted that you're a kid,

282
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,250
you won a lot of games.

283
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,590
You don't have a lot of money, what do you do?

284
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,910
You trade. - Yeah.

285
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,710
- Some people would occasionally buy a game.

286
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,002
I mean, I once bought a second Master System,

287
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,770
and I bought one game.

288
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,820
Because that was what I could afford.

289
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,350
I got "After Burner II."

290
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,790
I dunno if you've ever played that game.

291
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,800
It's pretty bad implementation

292
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,260
on the second Master System,

293
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,924
but it was like 600 crowners.

294
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:30,830
And I was making money at that time

295
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,610
doing newspaper delivery.

296
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,600
I had to do that for a month to afford one game.

297
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,280
I like video games way too much

298
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,440
to wait a month just to get one game.

299
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,990
So piracy was just the way you did it.

300
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,850
And that was how I got into running

301
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,320
this bulletin board system,

302
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,120
being part of the demo scene,

303
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,730
being part of the piracy scene to some extent.

304
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,190
And then also at some point realizing,

305
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,317
oh, you can actually also make money on this

306
00:11:55,317 --> 00:11:58,140
and this can fund buying more phone lines

307
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,230
and buying more modems and buying more Amigas.

308
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,030
Oh yeah, that was one of the demo parties.

309
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,320
These were amazing things.

310
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,888
- What am I looking at? - Isn't that amazing?

311
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:08,430
- Look at all those CRT monitors.

312
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,510
- All these CRT monitors.

313
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,254
Again, when I was 14,

314
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:15,029
I don't understand fully why my parents allowed this.

315
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,221
But I traveled from Copenhagen,

316
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:21,990
the capital of Denmark to Aarhus this tiny little town

317
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,440
in Jutland on the train with a bunch of dudes

318
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,020
who were like late teens and their 20s.

319
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,130
I'm 14 years old.

320
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,034
I'm lugging my 14-inch CRT monitor

321
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:35,490
with my computer in the back to go to the party.

322
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,323
That was what it was called.

323
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:38,610
That was the biggest demo scene party at that time.

324
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,770
And it was exactly as you see in that picture,

325
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,650
thousands of people just lining up with their computers,

326
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,050
programming demos all day long,

327
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,750
and trading these things back and forth.

328
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,710
- That's kind of awesome.

329
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:50,640
Not gonna lie.

330
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,230
It's a little ridiculous.

331
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,280
- It's totally awesome.

332
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,140
And I miss it in ways

333
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,260
where the internet has connected people in some ways,

334
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,030
but the connection you get from sitting

335
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,860
right next to someone else

336
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,540
who has their own CRT monitor

337
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,150
who's lugged at halfway around the country to get there

338
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,380
is truly special.

339
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,410
Because it was also just this burst of creativity.

340
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,490
You're constantly running around.

341
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,050
You're constantly surrounded by people

342
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,280
who are really good at what they could do.

343
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,960
They're really good at programming computers.

344
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,130
It's infectious.

345
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,360
It was part of that pang I felt then going like,

346
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,430
oh man, why can't I figure this out?

347
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,233
I mean, why can't I even figure out EasyAMOS?

348
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:28,170
It's kind of frustrating.

349
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,430
- But on your third attempt,

350
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,960
you a little more successful?

351
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,720
- So third attempt is when I start getting it,

352
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,450
this is when I start helping out,

353
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,540
let's say build things for the internet.

354
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,440
So around '95, I think it is, or '96,

355
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,330
I discovered the internet.

356
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,470
Actually, in ninth grade.

357
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,610
That was my first experience.

358
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,414
I went to some university in Denmark.

359
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,350
And in ninth grade, we had this excursion

360
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,390
and they sat us down in front of a computer

361
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,240
and the computer had Netscape Navigator, the first version,

362
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,703
or maybe it was even the precursor to that.

363
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,040
And they had a text editor.

364
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,067
And us kids just got like,

365
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:07,037
"Hey, built something on the internet."

366
00:14:07,037 --> 00:14:09,750
And it was just HTML and the first thing you do is like,

367
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,480
oh, I can make the text blink

368
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,850
by just putting in this tag and saving it.

369
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,850
That moment, that was actually when I reawaken the urge

370
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,540
to wanna learn the program

371
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,340
because I got a positive experience.

372
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,290
All the other experiences I had with programming

373
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,277
was I'd spend hours typing something in,

374
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:30,720
I'd click Run and it wouldn't work.

375
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,860
And I'd get an error message

376
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,320
that made no sense to me as a kid,

377
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,780
either at six or seven or at 12.

378
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,180
And here I am sitting in front of a computer

379
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,090
connected to the internet and I'm making text blink.

380
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,110
I'm making it larger.

381
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,943
I'm turning it into an h1 or an h2.

382
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,257
And these guys out here,

383
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:50,130
"We just did it for like an hour and a half."

384
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,160
And suddenly I go, oh, I can make things for the internet

385
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,701
that someone in Germany can be able to access and see,

386
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:59,490
and I don't have to ask anyone for permission.

387
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,360
This is super cool.

388
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,530
I gotta do more of this.

389
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,880
So I got into to the internet.

390
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
I got into working with HTML

391
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,296
and I still had all these friends from these demo parties.

392
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,360
And I started working with them

393
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,370
on creating gaming websites.

394
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,320
I'd rather buy the video games, I'd review him.

395
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,480
This was another good way of getting new video games

396
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,220
was to walk down to some store

397
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,380
and say like, hey, I'm a journalist.

398
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,940
I'm like this 15-year-old kid.

399
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,250
And they're looking at you, "You're a journalist?"

400
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,230
Yeah, can I borrow some games?

401
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,550
Because this was when games moved on

402
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,350
to the PlayStation and these other things.

403
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,890
You couldn't just as easily pirate, at least not at first.

404
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,840
So I went down there, did all that,

405
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,560
and that started the journey of the internet for me.

406
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,390
It started working on these gaming websites,

407
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,901
working with programmers,

408
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:43,200
figuring out that I could do something,

409
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,510
I could work on the HTML part. It's not really programming,

410
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,980
but it kind of smells like it.

411
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,150
You're talking to a computer.

412
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,700
You're making it put text on the screen

413
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,690
and you're communicating

414
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,400
with someone halfway around the world.

415
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,828
So that became my pathway back into programming.

416
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:59,400
And then slowly I picked up more and more of it.

417
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,238
First website I did with someone,

418
00:16:02,238 --> 00:16:04,560
one of these programs from the demo scene

419
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,530
that was dynamic was ASP.NET.

420
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,970
I wasn't even actually called .NET.

421
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,080
That was what we started on.

422
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,967
And then we moved on to PHP,

423
00:16:11,967 --> 00:16:14,460
and PHP was when I finally got it.

424
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,840
When it finally clicked.

425
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,056
When conditionals and loops and variables

426
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:23,269
and all of that stuff started to make sense enough to me

427
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,370
that I thought I can do this.

428
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,630
- So would it be fair to say

429
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,940
that we wouldn't have DHH without PHP,

430
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,297
and therefore you owe all of your success to PHP?

431
00:16:33,297 --> 00:16:35,280
- 100% that's true.

432
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,840
And it's even better than that

433
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,650
because as PHP to me didn't just give a start

434
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,080
in terms of making my own web applications,

435
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,820
it actually gave me a bar.

436
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,360
In many ways, I think the pinnacle of developer,

437
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,500
web developer ergonomics is late '90s PHP,

438
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,850
you write this script,

439
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,800
you FTP it to a server and instantly it's deployed.

440
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,940
Instantly it's available.

441
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,490
You change anything in that file and you reload.

442
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,570
Boom, it's right there.

443
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,510
There's no web servers, there's no setup.

444
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,393
There's just an Apache that runs mod PHP.

445
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,200
And it was essentially the easiest way

446
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,510
to get a dynamic webpage up and going.

447
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,359
And this is one of the things I've been chasing that high

448
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,460
for basically the rest of my career.

449
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,180
That it was so easy to make things for the internet

450
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,040
in the mid to late '90s.

451
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,560
How did we lose the sensibilities

452
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,920
that allowed us to not just work this way

453
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,050
but get new people into the industry

454
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,983
to give them that was success experiences that I had.

455
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:41,100
Adding a freaking blink tag to an HTML page,

456
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,880
FTPing a PHP page to an Apache web server

457
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,910
without knowing really anything about anything,

458
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,620
without knowing anything about frameworks,

459
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,791
without knowing anything about setup.

460
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,960
All of that stuff have really taken us to a place

461
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,590
where it sometimes feels like we're barely better off.

462
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,870
Like webpages aren't that different

463
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,143
from what they were in the late '90s, early 2000s.

464
00:18:03,143 --> 00:18:04,920
They're still just forms.

465
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,900
They still just write to databases.

466
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,940
A lot of people, I think are very uncomfortable

467
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,446
with the fact that they are essentially CRUD monkeys.

468
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:14,289
They just make systems

469
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:18,990
that create read, update or delete row in a database,

470
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,310
and they have to compensate

471
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,230
for that existential dread by overcomplicating things.

472
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,550
Now that's a bit of a character.

473
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,383
There's more to it.

474
00:18:27,383 --> 00:18:28,410
And there's things you can learn

475
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,720
from more sophisticated ways of thinking about this.

476
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,460
But there's still an ideal here,

477
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,530
which is why I was so happy you had Pieter Levels on,

478
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,870
because he still basically works like this.

479
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,130
And I look at that and go like,

480
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,060
man, that's amazing.

481
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,470
- Yeah, you're chasing that high.

482
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,340
He's been high all along

483
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,820
using PHP, jQuery and SQLite.

484
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,207
- I think it's amazing because he's proving

485
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:53,340
that this isn't just a nostalgic dream.

486
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,690
He's actually doing it.

487
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,010
He's running all these businesses.

488
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,600
Now some of that is, as he would admit up first upfront,

489
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,850
is that he's just one guy.

490
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,860
And you could do different things when you just one guy.

491
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,702
When you're working in a team,

492
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:08,400
when I started working on the team,

493
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,880
when I started working with Jason Fried on Basecamp,

494
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,140
we at first didn't use version control together.

495
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,730
I used version control for myself.

496
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,590
And then I thought, do you know what?

497
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,590
Designers, ah, they probably not smart enough

498
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,450
to figure out CBS.

499
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,720
And therefore I just like, no, no, no, you just FTP it up.

500
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
You just FTP it.

501
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,588
I knew they knew how to do FTP.

502
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:32,220
And then after the third time

503
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,480
I had overridden their changes.

504
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,650
I was like, goddammit.

505
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,276
I gotta teach Jason CBS to not do that again.

506
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:42,930
But I think there's still way more truth

507
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:45,420
to the fact that we can work the way we did in the '90s,

508
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,734
work the way Pieter works today, even in the team context.

509
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:52,410
And that we've been far too willing

510
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,643
to hand over far too much of our developer ergonomics

511
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:57,510
to the merchants of complexity.

512
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,060
- And you've been chasing that with Rails 8.

513
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,630
So how do you bring all the cool features

514
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,660
of a modern framework and make it no build,

515
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,717
make it as easy to create something

516
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:13,740
and to ship it as it was in the '90s with just PHP?

517
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,730
It's very difficult for me

518
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,863
to beat the Pieter Levels approach.

519
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,470
It's so easy to just ship some PHP.

520
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,700
- And it should be.

521
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,260
Why should it be harder than that?

522
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,370
Our computers today are almost infinitely faster

523
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,930
than what they were in the '90s.

524
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,192
So shouldn't we be able to work in even easier ways?

525
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,450
We should be looking back on the '90s ago,

526
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,130
like, oh, that was way too complicated.

527
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,470
Now we have more sophisticated technology

528
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:42,540
that's way faster and it allows us to work

529
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,790
in these easier to use ways.

530
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,177
But that's not true.

531
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:48,449
But now you can see the line I draw

532
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,310
in my work with Ruby on Rails,

533
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,930
and especially with Rails 8.

534
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,930
No build to me is reaching back to that '90s feeling

535
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,430
and going, now we can do

536
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,680
some of those things without giving up

537
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,580
on all the progress.

538
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,740
Because I do think you can get too nostalgic.

539
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,860
I do think you can start just fantasizing

540
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,360
that everything was better in the '90s.

541
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,193
It wasn't.

542
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:11,340
I mean, I was there.

543
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,140
There was a lot of things that sucked.

544
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,793
And if we can somehow find a way to combine

545
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:20,910
the advantages and advances we've had over the past 20 years

546
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,150
with that ease of developer ergonomics, we can win.

547
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,860
No build is a rejection of the part of web development

548
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,190
I've hated the most in the past 10, 15 years,

549
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,275
which is the JavaScript scene.

550
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:38,070
And I don't say that as someone who hate JavaScript.

551
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,630
I mean, I often joke that JavaScript.

552
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,300
It's my second favorite program language.

553
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,680
It's a very distant second.

554
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,840
Ruby is by far and away number one,

555
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,130
but I actually like JavaScript.

556
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:49,260
I don't think it's a bad language.

557
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,323
It gets a lot of flack.

558
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:53,867
People add a string of two plus a one

559
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,360
and it gives something nonsense.

560
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,580
And I just go like, yeah,

561
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,050
but why would you do that?

562
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,010
Just don't do that.

563
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,990
The language is actually quite lovely,

564
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,670
especially the modern version.

565
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,680
ES6 that really introduced a proper class syntax to it.

566
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,930
So I could work with JavaScript in many of the same ways

567
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,095
that I love working with Ruby made things so much better.

568
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:18,095
But in the early 2010s until quite recently,

569
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:23,160
all of that advancement happened in pre-processing,

570
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,020
happened in built pipelines.

571
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,140
The browsers couldn't speak a dialect of JavaScript

572
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,490
that was pleasant to work with.

573
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,310
So everyone started to pre-filing their JavaScript

574
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:36,084
to be able to use more modern ways of programming

575
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:39,120
with a browser that was seen as stuck

576
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,040
with an ancient version of JavaScript

577
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,050
that no one actually wanted to work with.

578
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,700
And that made sense to me,

579
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,770
but it was also deeply unpleasant.

580
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,750
And I remember thinking during that time,

581
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,630
the dark ages, as I refer to them with JavaScript,

582
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,220
that this cannot be the final destination.

583
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,590
There's no way that we have managed

584
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,590
to turn the internet into such an unpleasant place to work.

585
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,780
Where I would start working on a project in JavaScript

586
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,690
using webpack and all of these dependencies.

587
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,480
And I would put it down for literally five minutes

588
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,490
and the thing wouldn't compile anymore.

589
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,580
The amount of churn that the JavaScript community,

590
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,020
especially with its frameworks

591
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,910
and its tooling went through

592
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,038
in the decade from 2010 to 2020 was absurd.

593
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,038
And you had to be trapped inside of that asylum

594
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,450
to not realize what an utterly perverse situation

595
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,520
we had landed ourselves in.

596
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,393
Why does everything break all the time?

597
00:23:41,393 --> 00:23:42,480
I mean, the joke

598
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,220
wouldn't be just that the software would break,

599
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,390
that would annoy me personally.

600
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,280
But then I'd go on Hacker News

601
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,810
and I'd see some thread

602
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,577
on the latest JavaScript release of some framework.

603
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:55,567
And the thread would be like, someone would ask,

604
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:56,730
"Well, aren't we using the thing

605
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,110
we just used three months ago?"

606
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,360
And people would be like, "That thing is so outdated.

607
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,515
That's so three months ago.

608
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:04,470
You gotta get with the new program.

609
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,150
We're completely rewriting everything

610
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,040
for the oomph-teen time."

611
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,380
And anything you've learned in the framework

612
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,350
you've been spending the last amount of time on,

613
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,310
it's all useless.

614
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,710
You gotta throw everything out and you gotta start over.

615
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,007
Why aren't you doing it, stupid idiot?

616
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:20,280
- Is that a kind of mass hysteria

617
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,383
that took over the developer community you think?

618
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:24,900
Like where you have to keep creating new frameworks

619
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:25,740
and new frameworks.

620
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,159
And are we past that dark age?

621
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,018
- I think we're getting out of it,

622
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:33,060
and we're getting out of it

623
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,970
because browsers have gotten so much better.

624
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,640
There was a stagnation in browser technology.

625
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,648
Some of it was an overhang all the way back from IE5.

626
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:46,650
So IE5 essentially put the whole internet development

627
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,420
experience into a deep freeze,

628
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,130
because Microsoft won the browser wars in the mid 2000s,

629
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,720
and then they basically disbanded

630
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,393
their browser development team.

631
00:24:56,393 --> 00:24:57,930
'Cause they're like, "All right, job done.

632
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,180
We don't need any more innovation on the internet.

633
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,220
Can we just go back to writing Windows forms

634
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,140
or something now that we control everything?"

635
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,140
And it really wasn't until obviously Firefox

636
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,490
kind of kindled a little bit of something.

637
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,410
Then Chrome got into the scene

638
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,200
and Google got serious about moving to web forward.

639
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,826
That you had a kindling

640
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,760
of maybe the browser could be better.

641
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,640
Maybe the browser wasn't frozen in time in 2005.

642
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,970
Maybe the browser could actually evolve

643
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,060
like at the development platform that it is.

644
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,780
But then what happened was you had a lot of smart people

645
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,000
who poured in to the web

646
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,880
because the web turned out to be the greatest

647
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,100
application development platform of all time.

648
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,350
This was where all the money was being made.

649
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,540
This was where all the billionaires were being minted.

650
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,010
This was where the Facebooks

651
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,800
and whatever of the world came to be.

652
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,430
So you had all of this brain power

653
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,460
applied to the problem of how to work with the web.

654
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,890
And there were some very smart people

655
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,040
with some, I'm sure very good ideas

656
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,600
who did not have programmer happiness

657
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,850
as their motivation number one.

658
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,850
They had other priorities

659
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:16,620
and those priorities allowed them to discount

660
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,780
and even rationalize the complexity

661
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,420
they were injecting everywhere.

662
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,290
Some of that complexity

663
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,360
came from organizational structure.

664
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,550
When you have a company like Facebook, for example,

665
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,890
that does depend on the web and wanna push it forward,

666
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,330
but have sliced the development role job

667
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,550
into these tiny little niches.

668
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,550
I'm a front-end glob pipeline configurator.

669
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,325
Oh yeah, well, I'm a front-end whatever engineer.

670
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:48,437
And suddenly the web developer was no longer one person.

671
00:26:48,437 --> 00:26:50,430
It was 15 different roles.

672
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,677
That in itself injected a ton of complexity.

673
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:56,010
But I also wanna give it the bold case here,

674
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,170
which was that some of that complexity

675
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,530
was necessary to get to where we are today.

676
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,080
That the complexity was a bridge.

677
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,310
It wasn't the destination,

678
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,990
but we had to cross that bridge

679
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,640
to get to where we are today,

680
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,220
where browsers are frankly incredible.

681
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,743
The JavaScript you can write in a text file

682
00:27:13,743 --> 00:27:15,810
and then serve on a web server

683
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,060
for a browser to ingest is amazing.

684
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,590
It's actually a really good experience.

685
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,910
You don't need any pre-processing.

686
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,620
You could just write text files,

687
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,270
send them to a browser,

688
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,770
and you have an incredible development.

689
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,500
- And we should also say that it can kind of be broken,

690
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,420
at least the HTML, but even the JavaScript

691
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,340
could be a little bit broken and it kind of still works

692
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,559
like maybe a half-ass works.

693
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:40,559
But like, just the amount of mess of smelly code

694
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:44,280
that a browser has to deal with is insane.

695
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,700
- This is one of the hardest problems in computing today

696
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,250
is to parse the entire internet.

697
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,510
Because thankfully for us as web developers,

698
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,000
but perhaps not so much for the browser developers,

699
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,520
every webpage that has ever been created

700
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,885
minus the brief period with Flash still runs today.

701
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:07,290
The webpage I did in ninth grade would render

702
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,850
on a modern browser today,

703
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,220
30 years later. - That's crazy.

704
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,810
- That is completely crazy.

705
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,360
When you think about the amount of evolution

706
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,820
we've had with the web, how much better we've made it,

707
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,820
how many more standards browsers have adopted.

708
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,850
It's essentially an Apollo project today

709
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,840
to create a new browser,

710
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,370
which is why it doesn't happen very often,

711
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,950
which is why even companies like Microsoft

712
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,320
had to throw into towel and say, "We can't do it."

713
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,140
Now I actually don't think that's good for the web.

714
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,760
There is the danger of the monoculture

715
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,380
if we just get a single browser engine

716
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,280
that runs everything,

717
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,140
and we are in danger of that.

718
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,960
I love the fact that the Ladybird project, for example,

719
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,260
is trying to make a new browser engine from scratch.

720
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,370
I've supported that project.

721
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,350
I would encourage people to look into that.

722
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,600
It's really a wonderful

723
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,710
- Nice. - thing.

724
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,450
It's staffed by a bunch of people

725
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:57,150
who worked on other browser projects in the past.

726
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,490
- Truly independent web browser.

727
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,260
- We really need that.

728
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,810
But I can hold that thought in my head.

729
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,240
At the same time, I hold the thought in my head

730
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,915
that Google's Chrome was pivotal

731
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,510
to the web surviving

732
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,790
as the premier web development platform.

733
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,660
If it had not been for Google and their entire business

734
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,483
depending on a thriving open web,

735
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,940
Apple, Microsoft, I think would've been just as fine

736
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,400
to see the web go away to disappear

737
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,220
into being something that's just served

738
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,100
native web applications or native mobile applications

739
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,630
and native desktop applications

740
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,550
that they could completely control.

741
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,730
So I have all sorts of problems with Google,

742
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:43,020
but it's not Chrome.

743
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,400
Chrome is a complete gift to web developers everywhere,

744
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,830
to the web as a development platform.

745
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,280
And they deserve an enormous amount of credit,

746
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,113
I think for that.

747
00:29:54,113 --> 00:29:57,582
Even if it's entangled with their business model

748
00:29:57,582 --> 00:30:01,620
and half of Chrome is code that spies on you

749
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,960
or informs targeted ads.

750
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,150
And a bunch of things, I'm not a big fan of.

751
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,623
I can divorce that from the fact

752
00:30:07,623 --> 00:30:10,710
that we need champions in the corner of the web

753
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,520
who have trillions of dollars of market cap value

754
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,680
riding on the open web.

755
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,940
- We're gonna take tangents

756
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,650
upon a tangents upon a tangents.

757
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,580
So let's go to Chrome.

758
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,960
I think Chrome positive impact on humanities

759
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,688
is immeasurable for reasons that you just described.

760
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:29,190
On the technology front,

761
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,590
the features that present the competition they created,

762
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,710
it's spurred on this wonderful flourishing

763
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,700
of web technologies.

764
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,680
But anyway, I have to ask you about

765
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,710
the recent stuff with the DOJ,

766
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,560
trying to split up Chrome and Google.

767
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,180
Do you think this is a good idea?

768
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,310
Do you think this does harm?

769
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,483
- It's a disaster.

770
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,800
And I say that as someone who's been very sympathetic

771
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,860
to the antitrust fight, because I do think

772
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,380
we have antitrust problems in technology.

773
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,330
But the one place where we don't have them, by and large,

774
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,440
is with browsers,

775
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,430
is with the tools we use to access the open web.

776
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,890
First of all, we have Firefox.

777
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,074
Now Firefox is not doing all that great.

778
00:31:13,074 --> 00:31:17,070
And Firefox has been propped up by Google for many years

779
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,610
to deter from exactly what's going on with the DOJ

780
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,438
that they were the only game in town.

781
00:31:22,438 --> 00:31:24,480
Apple has Safari.

782
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,400
I have a bunch of problems with Apple too,

783
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
but I love Safari.

784
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,300
I love the fact that we have a premier browser

785
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,730
running on a premier operating system

786
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,320
that people can't turn the web

787
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,661
into just a Chrome experience.

788
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:40,410
But I also think that the open web

789
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,990
needs this trillion dollar champion,

790
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,310
or at least benefits from it.

791
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,540
Maybe it doesn't need it,

792
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,190
but it certainly benefits from it.

793
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,330
And of all the things

794
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,194
that are wrong with monopoly formation in technology,

795
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:54,180
Chrome is the last thing.

796
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,370
And this is why I get so frustrated sometimes

797
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,910
about the anti or the monopoly fight

798
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,260
that there are real problems.

799
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,870
And we should be focusing on the premier problems first.

800
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,250
Like the toll booths on our mobile phones.

801
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,450
They're far bigger problems.

802
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,410
It's not the open web.

803
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,720
It's not the tools that we use to access the open web.

804
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,900
If I don't want to use Chrome,

805
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,449
if my customers of my businesses that run on the internet

806
00:32:19,449 --> 00:32:21,660
don't wanna use Chrome, they don't have to.

807
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,280
We're never forced to go through it.

808
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,239
The open internet is still open.

809
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:29,280
So I think it's a real shame that the DOJ

810
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,100
has chosen to pursue Google in this way.

811
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,410
I do think there are other things you can nail Google for

812
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,870
and their ad monopoly maybe,

813
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,690
or the shenanigans done

814
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,240
in controlling both sides of the ad ledger

815
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,120
that they both controlled the supply and the demand.

816
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,200
There are problems.

817
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,220
Chrome, isn't it?

818
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,326
And you end up making the web much worse.

819
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:52,560
And this is the thing we always gotta remember

820
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,210
when we think about legislation,

821
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,090
when we think about monopoly fights

822
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,530
is you may not like how things look today.

823
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,886
And you may wanna do something about it,

824
00:33:01,886 --> 00:33:04,742
but you may also make it worse.

825
00:33:04,742 --> 00:33:08,393
The good intentions behind the GDPR in Europe

826
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:11,114
currently has amounted to what?

827
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:15,090
Cookie banners that everyone on the internet hates.

828
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,850
That helps no one do anything better,

829
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,310
anything more efficient that saves no privacy

830
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,870
in any way, shape or form

831
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,700
has been a complete boondoggle

832
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,807
that has only enriched lawyers

833
00:33:25,807 --> 00:33:29,940
and accountants and bureaucrats.

834
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,998
- Yeah, you said that the cookie banner is a monument

835
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:37,560
for why Europe is losing is doing the worst

836
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,723
of all the regions in tech.

837
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:44,550
- It's a monument to good intentions

838
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,963
leading straight to hell.

839
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,760
And the Europe is actually world class

840
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,010
in good intentions leading straight to hell.

841
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,225
- So hell is the cookie accept button

842
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:58,260
that you have to accept all cookies.

843
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,960
That's what hell looks like over and over.

844
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,797
You don't actually ever get to the web page.

845
00:34:02,797 --> 00:34:04,680
- Just on a human scale,

846
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,480
try to imagine how many hours every day are wasted

847
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,650
clicking that away.

848
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,520
And how much harm we've done to the web as a platform

849
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,520
that people enjoy because of them.

850
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,283
The internet is ugly in part because of cookie banners.

851
00:34:21,283 --> 00:34:25,320
Cookie banners were supposed to save us from advertisement,

852
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,300
and advertisement can make the web ugly.

853
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,679
There's plenty of examples of that,

854
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,020
but cookie banners made the entire internet ugly

855
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,330
in one felt swoop.

856
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,560
And that's a complete tragedy.

857
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,360
But what's even worse,

858
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,460
and this is why I call it out as a monument

859
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,110
to everything the EU gets wrong,

860
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:42,344
is that we have known this for a decade.

861
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:46,009
No one anywhere who's serious believes that cookie banners

862
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:48,090
does anything good for anyone.

863
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,219
Yet we've been unable to get rid of it.

864
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:52,350
There's this one piece of legislation

865
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,570
that's now I think 10 or 12 years old.

866
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,780
It's complete failure on every conceivable metric.

867
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,610
Everyone hates it universally,

868
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,938
yet we can't seem to do anything about it.

869
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:06,938
That's a bankruptcy declaration for any body of bureaucrats

870
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,690
who pretend or pretend

871
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,960
to make things better for not just citizens,

872
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,790
but people around the world.

873
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,110
This is the thing that really gets me

874
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,700
about cookie banners too.

875
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,260
It's not just the EU.

876
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,310
It's the entire world.

877
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,526
You can't hide from cookie banners anywhere on this planet.

878
00:35:23,526 --> 00:35:27,300
If you go to goddamn Mars on one of Elon's rockets

879
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,217
and you try to access a webpage,

880
00:35:29,217 --> 00:35:30,930
you still see a cookie banner.

881
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,810
No one in the universe is safe from this nonsense.

882
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:35,010
- Probably the interface

883
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,163
on the rocket. - It'll be slower.

884
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:42,163
You'll have basically 150 second ping time.

885
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,950
So it'll take you 45 seconds

886
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,890
just to get through the cookie banners from Mars.

887
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,410
- All right, let's walk back up the stack

888
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,720
of this recursive tangents we've been taking.

889
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,150
So Chrome, we should say,

890
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,440
at least in my opinion, is not winning unfairly.

891
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,440
It's winning in the fairway by just being better.

892
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,180
- It is, if I was gonna steal man the other side

893
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,627
just for a half second,

894
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:10,715
people would say, well, maybe yes,

895
00:36:10,715 --> 00:36:14,047
most people do sort of begrudgingly agree

896
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,810
that is a pretty good browser.

897
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,250
But then they'll say the reason it

898
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,095
got dominance was distribution.

899
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,240
And the reason it got distribution

900
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,687
was because Google also controls Android,

901
00:36:23,687 --> 00:36:26,100
and therefore can make Chrome the default

902
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,480
browser on all these phones.

903
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,854
Now I don't buy that.

904
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,380
And the reason I don't buy that

905
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,470
is because on Android, you are actually allowed

906
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,000
to ship a different browser

907
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,940
that has a browser engine that's not the same as Chrome.

908
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,480
Unlike on iOS, where if you wanna ship a browser,

909
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,179
Chrome, for example, ships for iOS,

910
00:36:44,179 --> 00:36:47,941
but it's not Chrome, it's Safari wrapped in a dress.

911
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:51,660
And every single alternative browser on iOS

912
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,000
have to use the Safari web engine.

913
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,410
That's not competition.

914
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,510
That's not what happened on Android.

915
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,892
Again, I think there are some nuances to it,

916
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:01,455
but if you zoom out

917
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:03,360
and you look at all the problems

918
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,610
we have with big tech, Chrome is not it.

919
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,343
Chrome won on merits.

920
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:10,472
I begrudgingly have switched to Chrome

921
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:12,207
on that realization alone.

922
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:14,812
As a web developer, I just prefer it.

923
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,830
I like Firefox in many ways.

924
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,300
I like the ethos of it,

925
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,600
but Chrome is a better browser than Firefox full stop.

926
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,730
- And by the way, we've never mentioned Edge.

927
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,040
Edge is also a good browser

928
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,810
- Because it's also Chrome in a dress.

929
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,400
- But it never gets to love.

930
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,890
I don't think I've ever used Bing,

931
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,050
and I'm sure Bing is really nice.

932
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,520
- Maybe you have, because you know what?

933
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,840
Is Bing in a dress?

934
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,399
- What? - DuckDuckGo.

935
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,540
Which is actually - What?

936
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,130
- the search engine that I use.

937
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,310
DuckDuckGo gets its search results from Bing,

938
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,420
or at least it used to.

939
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,430
If they change that, that would be news to me.

940
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,280
- Well, maybe everything

941
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,246
is just a wrap or a dress.

942
00:37:52,246 --> 00:37:54,120
Everything is wearing a dress underneath.

943
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,860
There's some other. - There's some of that.

944
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,690
- Turtles, all the dress is all the way down.

945
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,860
Okay, what were we talking about?

946
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,750
They, we got there from JavaScript

947
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,750
and from you learning how to program.

948
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,070
So eventually, the big success story

949
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:10,220
is when you built a bunch of stuff with PHP

950
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:14,596
and you were like actually shipping things.

951
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:17,640
And that's when the Ruby story came.

952
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,480
So what your big love affair

953
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,040
with programming began there?

954
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,270
So can you take me there?

955
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,380
What is Ruby?

956
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,000
Tell the story of Ruby.

957
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,240
Explain Ruby to me.

958
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,990
- PHP was what converted me

959
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,845
from just being able to fondle HTML

960
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,520
and turn out some web pages

961
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,363
to actually being able to produce web applications myself.

962
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:43,260
So I owe a tremendous gratitude to PHP in that regard.

963
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,190
But I never thought of PHP as a calling.

964
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,190
I never thought, I'm a professional programmer

965
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,350
who writes PHP, that's who I am

966
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,550
and that's what I do.

967
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,669
I thought of PHP as a tool

968
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:58,620
I needed to smack the computer with

969
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:01,170
until it produced web applications I wanted.

970
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,303
It was very much a means to an end.

971
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,900
I didn't fall in love with PHP.

972
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:09,540
I'm very grateful that it taught me

973
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,770
the basics of programming.

974
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:14,490
And I'm very grateful that it set the bar for the economics.

975
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,340
But it really wasn't until Ruby

976
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,400
that I started thinking of myself as a programmer.

977
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,510
And the way that came about

978
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,351
was that the first time I ever got hired

979
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:28,020
as a professional programmer to write code

980
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,422
was actually by Jason Fried, my business partner still.

981
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:34,650
All the way back in 2001,

982
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,560
I had been working on these gaming websites in PHP

983
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,780
for essentially 18 months at that point.

984
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,465
No one had been paying me to do code in that regard.

985
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:45,683
And I connect with Jason Fried

986
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,560
over an email sent from Copenhagen, Denmark

987
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,860
to Chicago, Illinois to a person who didn't know who I was.

988
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,500
I was just offering solicited advice.

989
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,575
Jason had asked a question on the internet

990
00:39:57,575 --> 00:40:00,910
and I had sent him the answer and he was asking in PHP.

991
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,547
And I'd sent him the answer to that question.

992
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:04,740
And we started talking and then we started working.

993
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,180
Which by the way, is a miracle

994
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,530
of what the internet can allow.

995
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,930
How can a kid in Copenhagen

996
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,120
who's never met this guy in Chicago

997
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,540
connect just over email and start working together?

998
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:18,011
And by the way, we're still working together now

999
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:20,370
24 years later.

1000
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,300
That's incredible.

1001
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,800
But we started working together

1002
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
and we started working together on some client projects.

1003
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Jason would do the design, 37signals would do design,

1004
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,220
I would bring the programming PHP.

1005
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:33,014
And after we'd work on I think two or three

1006
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,653
client projects together in PHP,

1007
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,820
we kept hitting the same problem.

1008
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,310
That whenever you work with a client,

1009
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,350
you start that project off an email.

1010
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:44,760
Oh yeah, let's work together.

1011
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,290
Here's what we're building.

1012
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,120
And you start trading more and more emails.

1013
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,180
And before a few weeks have passed,

1014
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,420
you gotta add someone to the project.

1015
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,690
They don't have the emails.

1016
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,830
They don't have the context.

1017
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,900
You send it, where's the latest file?

1018
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,640
Oh, I've uploaded on the FTP.

1019
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:03,330
It's like finalfinal_v06_2.0, right?

1020
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,163
That's the one to get.

1021
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:05,400
It's just a mess.

1022
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,690
A beautiful mess in some ways,

1023
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,510
a mess that still runs the vast majority of projects

1024
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,470
to this day.

1025
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,690
Email is the lowest common denominator.

1026
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,920
That's wonderful.

1027
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,770
But we had dropped the ball a couple of times

1028
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:18,330
in serious ways with customers

1029
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,400
and we thought we can do better.

1030
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,410
We know how to make web applications.

1031
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,450
Can't we just make a system

1032
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,120
that's better than email for managing projects?

1033
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,470
It can't be that hard.

1034
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,240
We've been doing blogs.

1035
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,470
We've been doing to-do lists.

1036
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,210
Let's put some of these together

1037
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,560
and just make a system

1038
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,130
where everything that anyone involved in the project needs

1039
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,270
is on one page.

1040
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,830
And it has to be simple enough

1041
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,500
that I'm not gonna run a seminar

1042
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,000
teaching you how to use the system.

1043
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,230
I'm just gonna give you the login code.

1044
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,100
You're gonna jump into it.

1045
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,125
So that's Basecamp.

1046
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:52,496
And when we started working on Basecamp,

1047
00:41:52,496 --> 00:41:57,496
I for the first time in the experience I had with Jason

1048
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,660
had the freedom of technology choice.

1049
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,402
There was no client telling me,

1050
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,170
"Yeah, PHP, that sounds good.

1051
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,003
We know PHP.

1052
00:42:05,003 --> 00:42:06,480
Can you build it in PHP?"

1053
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,653
I had free reigns.

1054
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,410
And at that time I'd been reading IEEE magazine

1055
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,890
and a couple of other magazines back from the early 2000s

1056
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,970
where Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler

1057
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,510
had been writing about programming patterns

1058
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,658
and how to write better code.

1059
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:30,271
And these two guys, in particular,

1060
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,659
were both using Ruby to explain their concepts

1061
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:37,020
because Ruby looked like pseudo code.

1062
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,188
Whether you were programming in C or Java or PHP,

1063
00:42:40,188 --> 00:42:42,690
all three constituencies could understand Ruby

1064
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,000
because it basically just read link English.

1065
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,210
So these guys were using Ruby to describe the concepts.

1066
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,721
And first of all, I would read these articles

1067
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:52,710
for just the concepts they were explaining.

1068
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,220
And I'd be like, what is this programming language?

1069
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,810
I mean, I like the concept you're explaining,

1070
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,000
but I also wanna see the programming language.

1071
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,550
Why haven't I heard of this?

1072
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,680
So I started looking into Ruby

1073
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,590
and I realized at that time,

1074
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,390
Ruby might not be known by anyone,

1075
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,310
but it's actually been around for a long time.

1076
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,950
Matz, the Japanese creator of Ruby

1077
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,520
had started working on Ruby back in '93.

1078
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,916
Before the internet was even a thing.

1079
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:24,916
And here I am in 2003, 10 years later,

1080
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,830
picking up what seems like this hidden gem

1081
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,520
that's just laying in obscurity in plain sight.

1082
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,830
But Dave Thomas and Martin Fowler,

1083
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:39,359
I think successfully put me and a handful of other people

1084
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,650
on the trail of a programming language

1085
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,250
that hadn't been used much in the west, but could be.

1086
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,768
So I picked up Ruby and I thought,

1087
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:52,800
this is very different.

1088
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,403
First of all, where are all the semicolons?

1089
00:43:55,403 --> 00:43:59,040
I'd been programming in PHP, in ASP,

1090
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,955
I'd even done some Pascal, I'd looked at some C.

1091
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,890
There were semicolons everywhere.

1092
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,240
And that was the first thing that struck me

1093
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,430
is where are the damn semicolons?

1094
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,140
And I started thinking,

1095
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,440
actually, why do we have semicolons in programming?

1096
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,186
They're to tell the interpreter

1097
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,840
that there's a new line of instructions,

1098
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,640
but I don't need 'em as a human.

1099
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,470
How? Oh,

1100
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,990
someone is looking out for the human here,

1101
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,700
not for the machine.

1102
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,230
So that really got me interested.

1103
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:31,230
And then I thought to myself, do you know what?

1104
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,580
I know PHP quite well.

1105
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,710
I'm not an amazing programmer.

1106
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,928
I haven't been working in programming for all that long,

1107
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:41,220
but maybe I can figure it out.

1108
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,170
I'm gonna give myself two weeks.

1109
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:44,970
I'm gonna write a proof of concept

1110
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,053
where I talk to a database,

1111
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:50,037
I pull some records, I format them a bit,

1112
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:51,960
and I display 'em on an HTML page.

1113
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Can I figure that out in a couple weeks?

1114
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,250
It took about one weekend

1115
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:59,460
and I was completely mesmerized.

1116
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,030
I was completely mind blown

1117
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,620
because Ruby was made for my brain

1118
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:12,510
like a perfect tailored glove by someone I'd never met.

1119
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,610
Like, how is this even possible?

1120
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,040
- We should say maybe like paint the picture

1121
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,350
of the certain qualities that Ruby has,

1122
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,940
maybe even compared to PHP.

1123
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,880
We should also say that there's a ridiculous thing

1124
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,770
that I'm used to that I forget about

1125
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,960
that there's dollar signs everywhere.

1126
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,141
PHP. - Yes, yes,

1127
00:45:29,141 --> 00:45:30,750
there's line noise.

1128
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,060
That's what I like to call. - There's line noise.

1129
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,520
Line noise, that's such a beautiful phrase.

1130
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,080
Yeah, so there's all these things

1131
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,390
that look like programs.

1132
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:40,530
And with Ruby,

1133
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,500
I mean there's some similarities in Python there.

1134
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,900
It just looks kind of like natural language.

1135
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,400
You can read it normally.

1136
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,970
- Here's a wild loop that does a five iterations.

1137
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:52,410
You can literally type

1138
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,050
the number five, dot,

1139
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,030
now I'm calling a method under number five.

1140
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:00,000
By the way, that's one of the beautiful aspects of Ruby

1141
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,170
that primitives like integers are also objects.

1142
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:09,170
And you can call 5.times, start brackets.

1143
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:11,998
Now you're iterating over

1144
00:46:11,998 --> 00:46:15,240
the code in that bracket five times, that's it.

1145
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,127
- [Lex] Okay, that's nice.

1146
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:18,870
- That's not just nice, that's exceptional.

1147
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,670
There's literally no other programming language

1148
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,660
that I know of that has managed to boil away the line noise

1149
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,230
that almost every other programming language would inject

1150
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:30,600
into a five time iteration

1151
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,170
over a block of code to that extent.

1152
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,731
- Wow, that's a really nice,

1153
00:46:33,731 --> 00:46:35,700
well, thank you for giving that example.

1154
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,800
That's a beautiful example.

1155
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,060
Wow, I don't think I know

1156
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,500
what programming language that does that.

1157
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,333
That's really nice.

1158
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,006
- Ruby is full of that.

1159
00:46:43,006 --> 00:46:44,976
So let me dive into a couple of examples.

1160
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:47,453
Because I really think it helps paint the picture.

1161
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:50,220
And let me preface this by saying I actually,

1162
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,773
I like the ethos of Python.

1163
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:53,910
I think the Ruby and the Python community

1164
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,820
share a lot of similarities.

1165
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,354
They're both dynamic interpreted languages.

1166
00:46:59,354 --> 00:47:04,080
They're both focused on immediacy and productivity

1167
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,640
and ease of use in a bunch of ways.

1168
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,220
But then they're also very different in many other ways.

1169
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,600
And one of the one ways

1170
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,940
they're very different is aesthetically.

1171
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,080
Python, to me, I hope I don't offend people too much.

1172
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,280
I've said this before, it's ugly.

1173
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:20,730
And it's ugly in its space,

1174
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:25,080
because it's full of superfluous instructions

1175
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,520
that are necessary for legacy reasons

1176
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,915
of when Guido made Python back in '87

1177
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:35,130
that are still here in 2025.

1178
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:37,110
And my brain can't cope with that.

1179
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:38,880
Let me give you a basic example.

1180
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,070
When you make a class in Python,

1181
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:44,610
the initialize a method, the starting method is def.

1182
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,443
Okay, fair enough.

1183
00:47:45,443 --> 00:47:47,405
That's actually the same as Ruby,

1184
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:48,898
D-E-F, definition of a method.

1185
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:52,670
Then it is underscore, not one,

1186
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:57,670
underscore, two, init, underscore, underscore,

1187
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:02,677
parentheses start, self, comma,

1188
00:48:02,677 --> 00:48:03,510
and then the first argument.

1189
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,837
- [Lex] Yeah, the whole self thing.

1190
00:48:05,837 --> 00:48:08,370
- I look at that and go, I'm sorry I'm out.

1191
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,218
I can't do it.

1192
00:48:10,218 --> 00:48:12,720
It's everything about it

1193
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,730
offends my sensibilities to the core.

1194
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,580
Here you have the most important method

1195
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,330
that all new objects or classes have to implement.

1196
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,540
And it is one of the most aesthetically offensive ways

1197
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,228
of typing initialized that I've ever seen anywhere.

1198
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:29,100
And you guys are okay with this?

1199
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,450
- Hey, you're making me, you know,

1200
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,850
where you're like talking about my marriage

1201
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,080
or something like this,

1202
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,100
and I'm not realizing

1203
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,110
I've been in a toxic relationship all along.

1204
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,877
Yet, I just get used to it.

1205
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:41,640
- That to me, by the way, was the magic of Ruby.

1206
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,930
It opened my eyes

1207
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,410
to help beautiful program could be.

1208
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:49,020
I didn't know I'd been working in ASP.

1209
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,040
I'd been working in PHP.

1210
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,020
I didn't even have the concept

1211
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,990
that aesthetics beautiful code

1212
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,801
was something we could optimize for that.

1213
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,530
Something we could pursue.

1214
00:48:58,530 --> 00:48:59,643
And even more than that,

1215
00:48:59,643 --> 00:49:02,955
that we could pursue it above other objectives.

1216
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:05,913
That Ruby is as beautiful as it is.

1217
00:49:05,913 --> 00:49:08,580
It's not an accident and it's not easy.

1218
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,519
Ruby itself is implemented in C.

1219
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:14,370
It's very difficult to parse Ruby code,

1220
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,650
because Ruby is written for humans

1221
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,230
and humans are messy creatures.

1222
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,750
They like things in just the right way.

1223
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:26,710
I can't fully explain why the __init___ make me repulse,

1224
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,480
but it does.

1225
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,335
And when I look at the Ruby alternative,

1226
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:34,080
it's really instructive.

1227
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,048
So it's def, same part, D-E-F, space,

1228
00:49:38,048 --> 00:49:41,130
initialize, parentheses.

1229
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:41,970
Not even parentheses.

1230
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,530
If you don't need to call it within the arguments,

1231
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,520
there's not even a parentheses.

1232
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,590
That in itself is actually also a major part.

1233
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:49,080
If the human doesn't need the additional characters,

1234
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,790
we're not just gonna put them in

1235
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:54,330
because it'd be nicer to parse for the computer.

1236
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,710
We're gonna get rid of the semicolons.

1237
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,300
We're gonna get rid of the parentheses.

1238
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,510
We're gonna get rid of the underscores.

1239
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,790
We're gonna get rid of all that ugliness,

1240
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:03,930
all the line noise

1241
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,790
and boil it down to its pure essentials.

1242
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:09,840
And at the same time, we're not gonna abbreviate.

1243
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,360
This is a key difference in the aesthetics

1244
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,399
between Ruby and Python as well.

1245
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:17,700
init, short of type, it's only five characters.

1246
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:21,027
Initialize is a lot longer, but it looks a lot better

1247
00:50:21,027 --> 00:50:23,070
and you don't type it very often.

1248
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,900
So you should look at something pretty.

1249
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,640
If you don't have to do it all the time,

1250
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,353
it's okay that it's long.

1251
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,442
Those kinds of aesthetic evaluations

1252
00:50:31,442 --> 00:50:34,530
are rife all over the Ruby language.

1253
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:36,700
But let me give you an even better example.

1254
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,850
The if conditional.

1255
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:42,150
That's the bedrock of all programming languages.

1256
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,100
They have the if conditional.

1257
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,900
If you take most programming languages,

1258
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,070
they all have if.

1259
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,050
That's basically the same in almost every language.

1260
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:52,237
Space, start parentheses, we all do that.

1261
00:50:52,237 --> 00:50:55,740
And then you have perhaps,

1262
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,170
let's say you're calling a object

1263
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:03,170
called user.isadmin, close parentheses, close parentheses,

1264
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,230
start brackets, and here's what we're gonna do

1265
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,749
if the user is an admin, right?

1266
00:51:11,749 --> 00:51:13,500
That would be a normal programming language.

1267
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,300
Ruby doesn't do it like that.

1268
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,920
Ruby boils almost all of it away.

1269
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:17,753
We start with the if.

1270
00:51:17,753 --> 00:51:19,260
Okay, that's the same.

1271
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,760
No parenthesis necessary

1272
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,880
because there's no ambiguity for the human

1273
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,280
to distinguish that the next part

1274
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,990
is just a single statement.

1275
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,578
So you do if, space, user, dot,

1276
00:51:32,578 --> 00:51:35,733
admin, question mark.

1277
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,810
No open brackets, no parentheses, no nothing.

1278
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,610
Next, open line.

1279
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:45,690
Here's your conditional.

1280
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:50,690
That question mark means nothing to the computer,

1281
00:51:50,762 --> 00:51:53,460
but it meets something to the human.

1282
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,110
Ruby put in the predicate method style

1283
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:02,368
purely as a communication tool between humans.

1284
00:52:02,368 --> 00:52:05,760
It's actually more work for the interpreter

1285
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,430
to be able to see that this question mark is there.

1286
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,020
Why is this question mark in here?

1287
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,930
Because it just reads so nicely.

1288
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,600
If user.admin?

1289
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:20,181
That's a very human phrase, but it gets better.

1290
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:22,260
You can turn this around.

1291
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,260
You can have your statement

1292
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,390
you want to execute before the conditional.

1293
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:30,870
You can do user.upgrade.

1294
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,990
Say you're calling an upgrade method on a user.

1295
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:38,370
Space, if, space, user.admin?.

1296
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:41,400
We do the thing if the thing is true.

1297
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,280
Instead of saying, if the thing is true, do the thing.

1298
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,510
But it gets even better.

1299
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,400
This is why I love this example with the conditional,

1300
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,720
because you can keep diving into it.

1301
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,660
So let's flip it around.

1302
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,490
user.downgrade if !not user.admin, right?

1303
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:02,190
That'd be a typical way of writing it.

1304
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:06,000
Ruby goes, that exclamation point is light noise.

1305
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,350
Why do we have if

1306
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,420
and then an exclamation point, that's ugly.

1307
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:14,420
We could do user.downgrade unless user.admin?

1308
00:53:17,719 --> 00:53:21,670
That to me is an encapsulation of the incredible beauty

1309
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:27,024
that Ruby affords the programmer through ambiguity

1310
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:31,380
that is only to serve the human reader and writer.

1311
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,540
All of these statements we've just discussed,

1312
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,830
they're the same for the computer.

1313
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,290
It'll combine down to the same C code.

1314
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,660
That'll compile down to the same assembly code.

1315
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,130
It makes no difference whatsoever.

1316
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:44,132
In fact, it just makes it harder to write an interpreter.

1317
00:53:44,132 --> 00:53:46,980
But for the human who gets to choose

1318
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,380
whether the statement comes before the conditional

1319
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:52,920
or the predicate method has, it's just incredible.

1320
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,290
It reads like poetry at some point.

1321
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,970
- It's also incredible that, you know,

1322
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,280
one language designer's creating that, you know,

1323
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,480
Guido van Rossum also, it's like one person

1324
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,790
gets to make these extremely difficult decision

1325
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:08,280
because you have to think about

1326
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,504
how does that all get parsed?

1327
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:13,290
And you have to think about the thousands,

1328
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,810
if it's a popular language that millions of people

1329
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:17,880
that end up using this.

1330
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,339
And what they feel, what that question mark

1331
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:23,338
for the if statement, what does that feel like

1332
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:24,960
for the user? - That's what Matz

1333
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,930
thought about because he started his entire mission

1334
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:29,490
off a different premise

1335
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,280
than almost every programming language designer

1336
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,740
that I'd heard, at least articulate the vision.

1337
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,040
That his number one goal was programmer happiness.

1338
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,330
That his number one goal was the affordances

1339
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,210
that would allow programmers to articulate code

1340
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:49,999
in ways that not just execute it correctly,

1341
00:54:49,999 --> 00:54:54,210
but were a joy to write and were a joy to read.

1342
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,840
And that vision is based on a fundamentally

1343
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,350
different view of humanity.

1344
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,200
There's no greater contrast between Matz

1345
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,930
and James Gosling, the designer of Java.

1346
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:11,310
I wanted to listen to James talk about the design of Java.

1347
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,990
Why was it the way it was?

1348
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:14,700
Why was it so rigid?

1349
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,230
And he was very blunt about it,

1350
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,760
which, by the way, I really appreciate.

1351
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,880
And I think Gosling has done a tremendous job with Java.

1352
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,120
But his view of humanity is rather dark.

1353
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,958
His view of humanity was programmers

1354
00:55:26,958 --> 00:55:30,638
at the average are stupid creatures.

1355
00:55:30,638 --> 00:55:33,548
They cannot be trusted,

1356
00:55:33,548 --> 00:55:36,630
which sophisticated programming languages

1357
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,500
because they're gonna shoot their foot off or their handoff.

1358
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,720
And that would be kind of inconvenient

1359
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,450
to the regional development office

1360
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:48,240
of a mid-tier insurance company

1361
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,603
writing code that has to last for 20 years.

1362
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:56,490
Now it's actually a very Thomas-Sowell view

1363
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:59,220
of constrained capacity in humans

1364
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,260
that I've come to appreciate much later in life.

1365
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,200
But it's also a very depressing view of programmers

1366
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,970
that there are just certain programmers

1367
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:10,970
who are too dumb to appreciate code poetry.

1368
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:14,280
There are too ignorant to learn how to write it well.

1369
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,190
We need to give them a sandbox

1370
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:20,071
where they just won't hurt themselves too much.

1371
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:23,550
Matz went the completely opposite direction.

1372
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,500
He believes in humanity.

1373
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,190
He believes in the unlimited capacity of programmers

1374
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:31,200
to learn and become better.

1375
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,200
So much so that he's willing to put the stranger

1376
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,460
at his own level.

1377
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,570
This is the second part I truly appreciate about Ruby.

1378
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:46,920
Ruby allows you to extend base classes.

1379
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,470
You know how we just talked about 5.times

1380
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,370
is a way to iterate over a statement five times?

1381
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:56,250
That five is obviously a base class.

1382
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,540
It's a number.

1383
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,373
Do you know what?

1384
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:01,355
You can add your own methods to that.

1385
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:03,990
I did, extensively.

1386
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,480
In Rails, we have something called active support,

1387
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,030
which is essentially my dialect of Ruby

1388
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:11,244
for programming web applications.

1389
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:13,200
And I'll give you one example.

1390
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,820
I've added a method called days to the Number.

1391
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,670
So if you do 5.days,

1392
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:23,250
you get five days in seconds.

1393
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:26,850
Because seconds is the way we set cache expiration times

1394
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:27,690
and other things like that.

1395
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:32,690
So you can say cache expires in 5.days.

1396
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:34,440
And you're gonna get

1397
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,032
whatever's five times - That's nice.

1398
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:39,660
- 24 times 60 times 60 is,

1399
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,760
or whatever the math is, right?

1400
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,560
Very humanly readable.

1401
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:44,880
In a novel programming language,

1402
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,040
you would type out the seconds

1403
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,020
and then you would have a little comment above it

1404
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,360
saying this represent five days.

1405
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,400
In Ruby, you get to write five days.

1406
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,660
But even better than that,

1407
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,700
Matz didn't come up with it.

1408
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,650
Matz didn't need the five days.

1409
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,740
I needed that because I needed to expire caches.

1410
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:06,420
I was allowed by Matz to extend his story

1411
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:10,140
with my own chapters unequal footing,

1412
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:13,110
such that a reader Ruby could not tell the difference

1413
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,530
between the code Matz wrote and the code that I wrote.

1414
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,430
He trusted me as a complete stranger from Denmark

1415
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:24,680
who had never met to mess with his beautiful story.

1416
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,960
That level of trust is essentially unheard of.

1417
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,270
I know there are other program languages that allow things

1418
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:31,620
with macros and so forth.

1419
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,710
But none do it in a way like Ruby does it.

1420
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:38,520
None does it with an articulated vision of humanity,

1421
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,378
a trust in humanity like Matz does,

1422
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:46,650
that is the opposite end of the spectrum of Java.

1423
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:49,380
- Yeah, I mean for my aesthetic sensibilities,

1424
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,975
just the way you describe 5.days,

1425
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:53,943
that's really pleasant to me.

1426
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:57,225
Like I could see myself sitting alone,

1427
00:58:57,225 --> 00:59:01,020
sleep deprived, and just writing that.

1428
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,250
It's just an easy thing.

1429
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,290
You can write it in a long way with a comment.

1430
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,820
You can write multiple lines.

1431
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,160
You could do, and now with AI,

1432
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,630
I'm sure it's gonna generate it correctly,

1433
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:10,830
but there's something really pleasant

1434
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:11,880
about the simplicity of that.

1435
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,350
I'm not sure what that is.

1436
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,183
But you're right,

1437
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,860
there is a good feeling there.

1438
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,780
And I'm sure we'll talk about happiness

1439
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,700
from all kinds of philosophical angles,

1440
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:25,700
but you know, that is what happiness is made of.

1441
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:27,480
That little - Exactly.

1442
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,740
- good feeling there.

1443
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,070
- It's the good feeling that come out of a concept

1444
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,400
compressed to its pure essence.

1445
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,410
There's nothing you can take away

1446
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:39,270
from that statement that's superfluous.

1447
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:41,462
- But see, I also wanna push back a little bit

1448
00:59:41,462 --> 00:59:46,240
'cause I also a program named Perl a bunch.

1449
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,273
Just be cool.

1450
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,660
So like it's not all about compression.

1451
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,490
- No, you can compress it too far.

1452
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,710
Perl golf is a thing

1453
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,500
where you can turn programs into something

1454
00:59:58,500 --> 00:59:59,670
that's unreadable for humans.

1455
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:01,320
Now the great thing about Perl

1456
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,360
was that it came out before Ruby.

1457
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,820
Matz was a great student of Wall,

1458
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,540
was a great student of Perl,

1459
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,250
was a great student of Python

1460
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,930
and Smalltalk and Lisp.

1461
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:16,320
He took inspiration from all of these prior attempts

1462
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,850
at creating good programming languages

1463
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:21,549
and really edited down the very best bits into this.

1464
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:24,510
So he was able to learn from his lessons.

1465
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:27,600
But what I found incredible about Ruby

1466
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,794
is that here we are 2025,

1467
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:33,120
Ruby has been worked on for over 30 years,

1468
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,883
and essentially the first draft

1469
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,550
is 90% of what we're still using.

1470
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,520
There was almost a sense of divine inspiration

1471
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,220
possible in wherever Matz was writing

1472
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,020
that initial version of Ruby

1473
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,230
that transcended time to such a degree

1474
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:51,800
that no one has still even begun to reach it.

1475
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,090
This is the other thing I always find fascinating.

1476
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,750
I generally believe in the efficient market theory

1477
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:59,610
that if someone comes up with a better mousetrap

1478
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,030
or better idea, others will eventually copy them

1479
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:05,400
to such an extent that perhaps the original mousetrap

1480
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,530
is no longer even remembered.

1481
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,620
No one has been able to copy that essence of Ruby.

1482
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:13,020
They borrowed elements, that's totally fine,

1483
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:16,650
but Ruby still stands taller than everyone else

1484
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:20,837
on these metrics, on this trust in humanity and programmers.

1485
01:01:20,837 --> 01:01:23,512
- And we should also say like, you know,

1486
01:01:23,512 --> 01:01:26,000
maybe the perfect programming language

1487
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,400
that metric and then there's the successful language

1488
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,900
and those are often different.

1489
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,100
There's something wonderful about

1490
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,473
the Brendan Eich story of creating JavaScript.

1491
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,730
There's something truly beautiful

1492
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:43,470
about the way JavaScript took over the world.

1493
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,780
I've recently got to visit the Amazon jungle

1494
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,180
and just one of my favorite things to do

1495
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,700
is just to watch the ants take over anything, everything.

1496
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,937
And it's just like it's a nice distributor system.

1497
01:01:52,937 --> 01:01:55,950
It's a messy thing that doesn't seem to be ordered,

1498
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:57,300
but it just works

1499
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,839
and the machinery of it. - Worse is Better.

1500
01:01:58,839 --> 01:01:59,880
Worse is Better.

1501
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,816
I mean that's actually the name of a pattern

1502
01:02:01,816 --> 01:02:03,870
in software development

1503
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,320
and other ways of how do is the pattern of Linux.

1504
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,660
Linux was quantifiably worse

1505
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,970
than I think it was Minx at the time.

1506
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:16,970
Other ways of it that were more cathedral less bizarre

1507
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,586
and it's still one that there's something to it

1508
01:02:20,586 --> 01:02:23,790
that the imperfections can help something go forward.

1509
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:26,820
It's actually a trick I've studied

1510
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,650
to the degree that I now incorporated

1511
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:30,420
in almost all open source that I do.

1512
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:32,880
I make sure that when I release the first version

1513
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,742
of any new thing I work on, it's a little broken.

1514
01:02:35,742 --> 01:02:37,920
It's a little busted in ways

1515
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,560
that invite people to come in and help me.

1516
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,330
Because there's no easier way

1517
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:46,050
to get the collaboration of other programmers

1518
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:47,100
than to put something out

1519
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,870
that they know how to fix and improve.

1520
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,614
- Yeah, that's awesome. - But Ruby is somehow,

1521
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:54,420
or was at least a little bit different in that regard.

1522
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,710
Not in all regards.

1523
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,710
Matz got the ethos of the language,

1524
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,660
the design of language just right.

1525
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,840
But the first versions of Ruby were terribly slow.

1526
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,220
It's taken, I mean hundreds of man years

1527
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,700
to get Ruby to be both this beautiful

1528
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,450
yet also highly efficient and really fast.

1529
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,152
- And we should say that the thing

1530
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:17,985
that made you fall in love

1531
01:03:17,985 --> 01:03:19,500
with this particular programming language

1532
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,180
is metaprogramming?

1533
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:23,850
- Yes, so that takes all of these elements

1534
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:27,060
we've just talked about and turned them up to 11.

1535
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:28,350
I'll explain metaprogramming

1536
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:29,183
real quick. - Yeah, please.

1537
01:03:29,183 --> 01:03:31,380
- Metaprogramming is essentially

1538
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,410
a version of the 5.days.

1539
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,891
You get to add keywords to the language.

1540
01:03:37,891 --> 01:03:40,710
Active record is the part of Rails

1541
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:43,020
that communicates with the database.

1542
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:48,020
This is a system where every table in the database

1543
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:50,040
is represented by a class.

1544
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,930
So if we take the user example, again,

1545
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:56,930
you do class user descends from active record base,

1546
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,600
and then the first line you can write is this.

1547
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,320
I want my users to have many posts or have many comments.

1548
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:05,153
Let's do that.

1549
01:04:05,153 --> 01:04:07,650
We're making some system where users can make comments.

1550
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:12,650
The very next line is has_many, space, colon comments.

1551
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:17,250
Now you've set up a dependency

1552
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,530
between users and comments

1553
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:24,000
that will give your whole host of access and factory methods

1554
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,770
for users to be able to own comments,

1555
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,790
to create comments, to update comments

1556
01:04:28,928 --> 01:04:33,330
in that line alone has many looks like a keyword.

1557
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,310
It looks like it's part of the Ruby language.

1558
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,510
That's metaprogramming.

1559
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,720
When Rails is able to add these elements

1560
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,150
to how you define a class

1561
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,330
and then that runs code that adds a bunch of methods

1562
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,983
to the use of class, that's metaprogramming.

1563
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:51,570
And when metaprogramming is used in this way,

1564
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,910
we call it domain specific languages.

1565
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,190
You take a generic language like Ruby

1566
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:00,125
and you tailor it to a certain domain like describing

1567
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:05,065
relationships in a database at a object level.

1568
01:05:05,065 --> 01:05:08,130
And this is one of those early examples

1569
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:11,130
where you can do, user has many comments.

1570
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:15,900
Belongs _two_ :account.

1571
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,900
Now you've set up a one-to-one relationship

1572
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,390
before we had a one-to-many relationship.

1573
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:24,270
Rails is rife with all these kinds

1574
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,830
of domain specific languages

1575
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:29,520
where at sometimes it doesn't even look like Ruby.

1576
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,800
You can't identify Ruby keywords.

1577
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:33,690
You can just identify

1578
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:37,800
what looks like keywords in its own programming language.

1579
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,940
Now again, I know that Lisp and others also do this stuff.

1580
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,460
They just do it with the maximum amount of line noise

1581
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,930
that can ever be crammed into a programming language.

1582
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:51,270
And Ruby does it at a level where you cannot tell

1583
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:54,450
my metaprogramming from Matz's keywords

1584
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,220
and with zero line noise.

1585
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,590
- Yeah, I should say that my first love was Lisp.

1586
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:01,890
So there's a slow tear that you can't see.

1587
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,740
- I've actually never written any real Lisp myself.

1588
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,320
- Well, how can you judge it so harshly then?

1589
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,870
- 'Cause I have two eyes and I can look at code,

1590
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,620
and my aesthetic sensibilities forbid me

1591
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:13,740
to even go much further.

1592
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,300
Which is a limitation, I know.

1593
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,770
I should actually dive into Lisp

1594
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:19,200
because I've found that I've learned a lot

1595
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:22,650
just diving into, maybe I'm insulting Lisp again here,

1596
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,110
but the past of programming languages

1597
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:26,820
with Smalltalk, for example.

1598
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:31,470
I think Smalltalk is a incredible experiment

1599
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,630
that also worked but isn't suitable

1600
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,120
for today's programming environments.

1601
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,220
- I love that we're talking about Ruby

1602
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,403
so much and what beautiful code is

1603
01:06:39,403 --> 01:06:41,670
and what a beautiful programming language is.

1604
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:45,544
So one of the things that is I think implied

1605
01:06:45,544 --> 01:06:49,050
maybe you made explicit in your descriptions there

1606
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:52,830
is that Ruby is dynamic typing versus strict typing.

1607
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:57,360
And you have been not just saying that it's a nice thing,

1608
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,840
but that you will defend dynamic typing to the death.

1609
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,710
Like that freedom is a powerful freedom to preserve.

1610
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:07,680
- It's the essence of what makes Ruby Ruby.

1611
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,240
This is why I don't fully understand

1612
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,960
when people call for Ruby to add static typing.

1613
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,570
'Cause to me, it's the bedrock of what this is.

1614
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:19,890
Why would you wanna turn one of the most beautiful languages

1615
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:21,930
into something far uglier?

1616
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:25,680
This is one of my primary objections to static typing.

1617
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,520
It's not just that it limits you in certain ways.

1618
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,665
It makes metaprogramming harder.

1619
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:32,430
I write a bunch of metaprogramming.

1620
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,013
I've seen what it takes to do metaprogramming TypeScript.

1621
01:07:35,013 --> 01:07:36,240
That was actually one of the things

1622
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:39,210
that just really sent me on a tear of getting meta

1623
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:40,230
or getting TypeScript

1624
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:42,180
out of some of the projects that I'm involved with.

1625
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,870
We pulled TypeScript out of turbo.

1626
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,330
One of the front-end frameworks that we have,

1627
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:51,030
because I tried to write to metaprogramming

1628
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,980
in TypeScript and I was just infuriated.

1629
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,287
I don't want that experience,

1630
01:07:55,287 --> 01:07:57,750
but I also don't want it from an aesthetic point of view.

1631
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,520
I hate repetition.

1632
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,790
We've just talked about how much I love that Ruby boils

1633
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:06,660
all of these expressions down to its essence.

1634
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,400
You can't remove one dot.

1635
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,670
You can't remove one character without losing something.

1636
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,370
This moment you go for static typing that you declare,

1637
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:15,510
at least I know there are ways

1638
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:17,640
to do implied typing and so forth.

1639
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,529
But let's just take the stereotypical case

1640
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:22,294
of a example, for example.

1641
01:08:22,294 --> 01:08:25,050
Capital U, user,

1642
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:28,109
I'm declaring the type of the variable;

1643
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:31,620
lowercase user, I'm now naming my variable;

1644
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:35,279
equals uppercase user or new uppercase user.

1645
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:37,689
I've repeated user three times.

1646
01:08:37,689 --> 01:08:40,459
I don't have time for this.

1647
01:08:40,459 --> 01:08:42,930
I don't have sensibilities for this.

1648
01:08:42,930 --> 01:08:45,899
I don't want my Ruby polluted with this.

1649
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:48,120
Now I understand all the arguments

1650
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,160
for why people like static typing

1651
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,700
when the primary arguments is that it makes tooling easier.

1652
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,649
It makes it easier to do auto complete

1653
01:08:55,649 --> 01:08:57,029
in editors, for example.

1654
01:08:57,029 --> 01:08:59,984
It makes it easier to find certain kinds of bugs

1655
01:08:59,984 --> 01:09:03,960
because maybe you're calling methods that don't exist

1656
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,270
on an object and the editor

1657
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:09,411
can actually catch that bug before you even run it.

1658
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:11,279
I don't care.

1659
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,479
First of all, I don't write code with tools.

1660
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:17,340
I write them with text editors.

1661
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:22,050
I chisel them out of the screen with my bare hands.

1662
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:23,189
I don't auto complete.

1663
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:24,779
And this is why I love Ruby so much,

1664
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:28,170
and this is why I continue to be in love

1665
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:31,176
with the text editor rather than the IDE.

1666
01:09:31,176 --> 01:09:33,029
I don't want an IDE.

1667
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:36,840
I want my fingers to have to individually

1668
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,580
type out every element of it

1669
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,660
because it will force me to stay in the world

1670
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,830
where Ruby is beautiful.

1671
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:45,270
Because as soon as it gets easy

1672
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,603
to type a lot of boilerplate, well guess what?

1673
01:09:47,603 --> 01:09:49,529
You can have a lot of boilerplate.

1674
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:52,319
Every single language basically

1675
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,040
that has great tooling support has a much higher tolerance

1676
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,380
for boilerplate because the thinking is, well,

1677
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,430
you're not typing it anyway,

1678
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:01,110
you're just auto completing it.

1679
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:02,310
I don't want that at all.

1680
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:07,310
I want something where the fabric I'm working in,

1681
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:08,550
it's just a text file.

1682
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,170
There's nothing else to it.

1683
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:12,390
So these things play together.

1684
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:14,880
There's the aesthetic part, there's the tooling part,

1685
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,680
there's the metaprogramming part.

1686
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,223
There's the fact that Ruby's ethos of duck typing,

1687
01:10:21,223 --> 01:10:23,790
I dunno if you've heard that term before.

1688
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:27,180
It's essentially not about, can I call this method,

1689
01:10:27,180 --> 01:10:30,720
if a object is of a certain class.

1690
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,620
It is, can I call this method if the method responds?

1691
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,140
It's very out of Smalltalk in that regard.

1692
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:38,400
You don't actually check

1693
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,880
of whether that class has the method,

1694
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,300
which allows you to dynamically add methods at runtime

1695
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,460
and do all sorts of really interesting things

1696
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,070
that underpin all the beautiful metaprogramming

1697
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,390
that we do in Ruby.

1698
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,978
I don't wanna lose any of that.

1699
01:10:52,978 --> 01:10:55,320
And I don't care for the benefits.

1700
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,080
One of the benefits I see touted over and over again

1701
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,013
is that it's much easier to write correct software.

1702
01:11:01,013 --> 01:11:02,910
You can have fewer bugs.

1703
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:06,060
You're gonna have less null pointer exceptions.

1704
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,740
You're gonna have less all of this stuff.

1705
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,240
Yeah, I don't have any of that.

1706
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,530
It's just not something

1707
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:13,560
that occurs in my standard mode of operation.

1708
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,690
I'm not saying I don't have bugs, of course I do,

1709
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,300
but I catch those bugs with unit testing,

1710
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,860
with integration testing.

1711
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:23,160
Those are the kinds of precautions

1712
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,214
that will catch logical bugs.

1713
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:28,230
Things that compile but are wrong

1714
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:30,780
along with the uncompilable stuff.

1715
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:33,810
So I've never been drawn into this world,

1716
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:35,073
and part of it is because I work

1717
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:36,720
on a certain class of systems.

1718
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:37,830
I fully accept that.

1719
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,120
If you're writing systems

1720
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:42,780
that have five, 10, 50 million lines of code

1721
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:44,880
with hundreds, thousands,

1722
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,040
or tens of thousands of programmers,

1723
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,920
I fully accept that you need different methods.

1724
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,050
What I object to is the idea

1725
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,760
that what's right for a code base

1726
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,380
of 10 million lines of code

1727
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,540
with a hundred thousand programmers working on it

1728
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:00,600
is also the same thing I should be using in my bedroom

1729
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:03,630
to create Basecamp, because I'm just a single individual.

1730
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:05,070
That's complete nonsense.

1731
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,000
In the real world,

1732
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,528
we would know that that makes no sense at all.

1733
01:12:08,528 --> 01:12:10,470
That you don't, I don't know,

1734
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:14,218
use your Pagani to go pick up groceries at Costco.

1735
01:12:14,218 --> 01:12:16,440
It's a bad vehicle for that.

1736
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:17,760
It just doesn't have the space.

1737
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,287
You don't wanna muddy the beautiful seats.

1738
01:12:19,287 --> 01:12:21,030
You don't wanna do any of those things.

1739
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:23,820
We know that certain things

1740
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,620
that are very good in certain domains

1741
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,453
don't apply to all.

1742
01:12:26,453 --> 01:12:27,600
In programming languages,

1743
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:29,043
it seems like we forget that.

1744
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:31,580
Now, to be fair, I also had a little bit perhaps

1745
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,000
of a reputation of forgetting that.

1746
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,590
When I first learned Ruby,

1747
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,870
I was so head over heels in love

1748
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,280
with this programming language

1749
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,290
that I almost found it unconceivable

1750
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:43,050
that anyone would choose any other programming language

1751
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,150
at all to write web applications.

1752
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,570
And I kind of engaged the evangelism of Ruby on Rails

1753
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,323
in that spirit as a crusade,

1754
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:54,090
as I just need to teach you the gospel.

1755
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:56,213
I just need to show you this conditional code

1756
01:12:56,213 --> 01:12:57,630
that we just talked about

1757
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:01,920
and you will convert at the point of a sharp argument.

1758
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,147
Now, I learned that that's not the way.

1759
01:13:03,147 --> 01:13:04,410
And part of the reason

1760
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:06,960
it's not the way is the programmers think differently.

1761
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,380
Our brains are configured differently.

1762
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:13,650
My brain is configured perfectly for Ruby.

1763
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:18,570
Perfectly for a dynamically duck typed language

1764
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:21,945
that I can chisel code out of a text editor with.

1765
01:13:21,945 --> 01:13:26,945
And other people need the security of an IDE.

1766
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:30,780
They want the security of classes

1767
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:33,540
that won't compile unless you call the methods on it.

1768
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,570
I have come to accept that, but most programmers don't.

1769
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:40,170
They're still stuck in, essentially, I like static typing.

1770
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,660
Therefore, static typing is the only way

1771
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:45,930
to create reliable correct systems,

1772
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:49,650
which is just such a mind blowing, to be blunt,

1773
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:52,420
idiotic thing to say in the face of evidence,

1774
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:55,001
mountains of evidence to the contrary.

1775
01:13:55,001 --> 01:13:59,130
This is one of the reasons I'm so in love with Shopify

1776
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:03,960
as the flagship application for Ruby on Rails.

1777
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,143
Shopify exists at a scale

1778
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:10,020
that most programmers will never touch.

1779
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:10,920
On Black Friday,

1780
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:15,305
I think Shopify did 1 million requests per second.

1781
01:14:15,305 --> 01:14:18,480
That's not 1 million requests of images.

1782
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,070
That's of dynamic requests

1783
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,961
that are funneling through the pipeline of commerce.

1784
01:14:22,961 --> 01:14:25,560
I mean, Shopify runs something like 30%

1785
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,207
of all e-commerce stores on the damn internet.

1786
01:14:29,207 --> 01:14:32,760
A huge portion of all commerce in total

1787
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,970
runs through Shopify and that runs on Ruby on Rails.

1788
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:39,823
So Ruby on Rails is able to scale

1789
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:43,485
up to that level without using

1790
01:14:43,485 --> 01:14:45,570
static typing in all of what it does.

1791
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,730
Now I know they've done certain experiments in certain ways

1792
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,380
because they are hitting some of the limits

1793
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,870
that you will hit with dynamic typing.

1794
01:14:51,870 --> 01:14:53,520
And some of those limits you hit

1795
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,980
with dynamic typing are actually, by the way,

1796
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:58,010
just limits you hit when you write 5 million lines of code.

1797
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:00,150
I think the Shopify monolith

1798
01:15:00,150 --> 01:15:01,680
is about 5 million lines of code.

1799
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:04,530
At that scale, everything breaks

1800
01:15:04,530 --> 01:15:06,060
because you're at the frontier

1801
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,370
of what humans are capable of doing

1802
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,570
with programming languages.

1803
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:10,590
The difference in part

1804
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,890
is that Ruby is such a succinct language

1805
01:15:13,890 --> 01:15:14,940
that those 5 million,

1806
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:17,880
if they had been written in, let's just say Go or Java

1807
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,520
would've been 50 or 25.

1808
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,910
Now that might have alleviated some of the problems

1809
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:26,280
that you have when you work on huge systems

1810
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,390
with many programmers.

1811
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,640
But it certainly would also have compounded them

1812
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,043
trying to understand 25 million lines of code.

1813
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,590
- So the thing does scale.

1814
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:37,261
That's a persistent myth that it doesn't scale

1815
01:15:37,261 --> 01:15:39,660
Shopify and others.

1816
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,929
But Shopify thinks a great example.

1817
01:15:41,929 --> 01:15:45,630
By the way, I love Shopify and I love Tobi, amazing.

1818
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:46,920
- You gotta have Tobi on. - Yeah, for sure.

1819
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,760
- Just talking to him this morning.

1820
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,050
- For sure, he's a brilliant.

1821
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,120
I got to hang out with him

1822
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,200
in the desert somewhere, I forget in Utah.

1823
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:53,600
He's just a brilliant human.

1824
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,190
And Shopify, shopify.com/lex has been supporting

1825
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,540
this podcast for the longest time.

1826
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:02,670
I don't think actually Tobi knows

1827
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:04,260
that they sponsor this podcast.

1828
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,700
I mean this is a big company, right?

1829
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,720
- It's a huge company.

1830
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,450
I think just under 10,000 employees,

1831
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:11,673
market cap of 120 billion,

1832
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:16,740
GMV of a quarter of a trillion every quarter.

1833
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,570
- And he's involved with the details though.

1834
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,860
- He is, very much so.

1835
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,639
Funny story about Tobi.

1836
01:16:21,639 --> 01:16:24,540
Tobi was on the Rails core team

1837
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:26,880
back in the mid 2000s.

1838
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,760
Tobi himself wrote Active Merchant,

1839
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,610
which is one of the frameworks for creating shops.

1840
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:35,190
He wrote the Liquid templating language

1841
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,680
that Shopify still uses to this day.

1842
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,650
He has a huge list of contributions

1843
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:43,960
to the Rails ecosystem, and he's the CEO of the company.

1844
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,393
Yeah, I think it's just...

1845
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:46,860
It's very inspiring to me

1846
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:50,250
because it's such at the opposite end of what I like to do.

1847
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,423
I like to chisel code with my own hands most of the day.

1848
01:16:53,423 --> 01:16:58,423
He runs a company of almost 10,000 people that is literally

1849
01:16:58,796 --> 01:17:01,830
like world commerce depends on it.

1850
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:05,730
A level of criticality I can't even begin to understand.

1851
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,200
And yet we can see eye to eye

1852
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,390
on so many of these fundamental questions

1853
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:12,991
in computer science and program development.

1854
01:17:12,991 --> 01:17:16,650
That is a dynamic range

1855
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:20,820
to be able to encompass Rails being a great tool

1856
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,290
for the one developer

1857
01:17:22,290 --> 01:17:23,910
who's just starting out with an idea

1858
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,650
who don't even fully know everything.

1859
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:28,140
Who is right at the level where PHP

1860
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:30,060
would've been a good fit in those late '90s

1861
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:31,500
because yeah, I could probably upload

1862
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,210
something to an FTP server, and so on.

1863
01:17:33,210 --> 01:17:35,640
Rails does have more complexity than that,

1864
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,620
but it also has so much longer runway.

1865
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,320
The runway goes all the way to goddamn Shopify.

1866
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,720
That is about the most convincing argument I can make

1867
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,410
for sort of dynamic range that we can do a lot of it.

1868
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,420
And even having said that,

1869
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:51,480
Shopify is the outlier of course.

1870
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,730
I don't think about Shopify

1871
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:56,040
as the primary target when I write Rails.

1872
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,080
I think of the single developer.

1873
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,380
Actually, I do think about Shopify.

1874
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,380
But I don't think about Shopify now.

1875
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,650
I think of Shopify when Tobi was writing Snow Devil,

1876
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:07,560
which was the first e-commerce store to sell snowboards

1877
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,920
that he created, that was the pre-Shopify Shopify.

1878
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,240
He created all by himself.

1879
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:15,840
And that was possible because Ruby on Rails

1880
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,760
isn't just about beautiful code.

1881
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:19,650
It's just as much about productivity.

1882
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:21,750
It's just as much about the impact

1883
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,853
that an individual programmer is able to have.

1884
01:18:23,853 --> 01:18:25,170
That they can build system

1885
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:27,270
where they can keep the whole thing in their head

1886
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:28,530
and be able to move it forward

1887
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:32,160
such that you can go from one developer

1888
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:33,933
sitting and working on something

1889
01:18:33,933 --> 01:18:34,860
and that something is Shopify

1890
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,730
and it turns into what it is today.

1891
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,510
When we talk about programming languages

1892
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:40,380
and we compare 'em,

1893
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,260
we often compare 'em at a very late stage.

1894
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,820
Like what is the better programming language

1895
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,640
for let's say Twitter in 2009

1896
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,830
when it's already a huge success.

1897
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,870
Twitter was started on Ruby on Rails.

1898
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,700
They then hit some scaling problems.

1899
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,710
It was a big debacle at the time.

1900
01:18:55,710 --> 01:19:00,710
They end up then I think writing it in some other language,

1901
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:02,880
which by the way I think is the best advertisement

1902
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,900
ever for Ruby on Rails,

1903
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,490
because nothing fucking happened

1904
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:08,400
for 10 years after they switched over, right?

1905
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,530
Essentially zero innovation.

1906
01:19:10,530 --> 01:19:14,430
Some of that was because they were doing a long conversion,

1907
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,590
and all of the early success

1908
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,570
in part came because they had the agility

1909
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:20,550
quickly change and adopt and so forth.

1910
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,140
That's what startups needs.

1911
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,310
That's what Shopify needed.

1912
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:24,660
That's what Twitter needed.

1913
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:26,160
That's what everyone needs.

1914
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,040
And that's the number one priority for Ruby on Rails.

1915
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,510
To make sure that we don't lose that.

1916
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,560
Because what happens so often when development tools

1917
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,870
and program language driven by huge companies

1918
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:39,592
is that they mirror their org chart.

1919
01:19:39,592 --> 01:19:43,740
React and everything else needed to use that

1920
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:48,090
is in some ways a reflection of how Meta builds Facebook.

1921
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:49,260
'Cause of course it is.

1922
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:50,820
Because of course it's an destruction of that.

1923
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,500
I'm not saying React isn't a great tool

1924
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,270
and that can't be used by smaller teams.

1925
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:55,140
Of course it can.

1926
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:58,020
But it's born in a very different context

1927
01:19:58,020 --> 01:20:00,000
than something like Ruby on Rails.

1928
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,800
- Let me say this a small aside

1929
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,320
because I think we might return to Shopify

1930
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,880
and celebrate it often.

1931
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,516
Just a sort of personal note.

1932
01:20:08,516 --> 01:20:11,940
This particular podcast has way more sponsors

1933
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,117
and sponsors that want to be sponsors

1934
01:20:14,117 --> 01:20:16,167
than I could possibly ever have.

1935
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:19,350
And it's really, really important for me

1936
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:21,240
to not give a shit,

1937
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:24,030
and to be able to celebrate people.

1938
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:25,350
Like I celebrate people.

1939
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:27,330
I celebrate companies.

1940
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:30,360
And I don't care that they're sponsoring.

1941
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,010
I really don't care.

1942
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:33,810
I just wanna make that very explicit

1943
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,580
'cause we're gonna continue saying

1944
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,960
positive things about Shopify.

1945
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,860
I don't care.

1946
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:39,120
Stop sponsoring.

1947
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,860
It doesn't really matter to me.

1948
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,870
But yeah, I just wanna make that explicit.

1949
01:20:42,870 --> 01:20:45,120
So, but to linger on the scaling thing

1950
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,963
with the Twitter and the Shopify,

1951
01:20:46,963 --> 01:20:48,988
can you just explain to me

1952
01:20:48,988 --> 01:20:50,853
what Shopify is doing with the YJIT?

1953
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:57,210
What did they have to try to do to scale this thing?

1954
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:59,296
Because that's kind of an incredible story, right?

1955
01:20:59,296 --> 01:21:01,920
- Yeah, so one of the great contributions

1956
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,290
that Shopify has made to the entire Ruby ecosystem,

1957
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:07,980
not just Rails but in particular Rails is YJIT.

1958
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:11,100
So YJIT is their compiler for Ruby.

1959
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,440
That just makes everything a lot more efficient

1960
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,880
and at Shopify scale eking out even a five,

1961
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,050
10% improvement in Ruby's overhead and execution time

1962
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:23,790
is a huge deal.

1963
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:27,083
Now, Shopify didn't need YJIT.

1964
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,680
Shopify was already running

1965
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,837
on the initial version of Ruby

1966
01:21:30,837 --> 01:21:34,920
that was, I think 10 times slower than what we have today.

1967
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,730
If you look back upon the Ruby 186,

1968
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,470
that Tobi probably started on just as I started on,

1969
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:43,757
and that was enough to propel Shopify

1970
01:21:43,757 --> 01:21:46,020
to the scale that it has today.

1971
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,990
A lot of the scaling conversation

1972
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:52,953
in is lost in a failure to distinguish two things.

1973
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:57,330
Scale is kind of one package we talk about

1974
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:59,700
when there are really multiple packages inside of it.

1975
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:03,090
One is runtime performance, latency.

1976
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:05,640
How fast can you execute a single request?

1977
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,380
Can it happen fast enough that the user

1978
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,240
will not notice?

1979
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,600
If your Rails request takes a second and a half to execute,

1980
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,010
the user's gonna notice.

1981
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:16,530
Your app is gonna feel slow and sluggish.

1982
01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:20,280
You have to get that response time down below,

1983
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:21,882
let's say at least 300 milliseconds.

1984
01:22:21,882 --> 01:22:25,057
I like to target a hundred milliseconds as my latency.

1985
01:22:25,057 --> 01:22:27,270
That's kind of performance.

1986
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,030
How much performance of that kind of latency

1987
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:32,437
can you squeeze out of a single CPU core,

1988
01:22:32,437 --> 01:22:34,020
that tells you something about

1989
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,459
what the price of a single request will be.

1990
01:22:36,459 --> 01:22:39,090
But then whether you can deal

1991
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,550
with 1 million requests a second

1992
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:43,500
like Shopify is doing right now.

1993
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,880
If you have one box

1994
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,206
that can do a thousand requests a second,

1995
01:22:47,206 --> 01:22:50,430
you just need X boxes to get up to a million.

1996
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:51,960
And what you'll actually find

1997
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,970
is that when it comes to programming languages,

1998
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:55,950
they're all the same in this way.

1999
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:59,175
They all scale largely beautifully horizontally.

2000
01:22:59,175 --> 01:23:01,189
You just add more boxes.

2001
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:04,410
The hard parts of scaling a Shopify

2002
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:07,320
is typically the program language.

2003
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,520
It's the database.

2004
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:12,120
And that's actually one of the challenges

2005
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:16,114
that Shopify has now is how do you deal with MySQL

2006
01:23:16,114 --> 01:23:18,660
at the scale that they're operating at?

2007
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:21,670
When do you need to move to other databases

2008
01:23:21,670 --> 01:23:23,910
to get worldwide performance?

2009
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:25,200
All of these things.

2010
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,152
The questions about scaling Ruby are economic questions.

2011
01:23:28,152 --> 01:23:32,111
If we are spending so and so much on application servers,

2012
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:35,250
if we can get just 5% more performance out of Ruby,

2013
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:37,110
well we could save 5% of those servers

2014
01:23:37,110 --> 01:23:39,420
and that could filter down into the budget.

2015
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:43,631
Now that analysis concludes into basically one thing.

2016
01:23:43,631 --> 01:23:47,405
Ruby is a luxury language.

2017
01:23:47,405 --> 01:23:51,780
It's a luxury, the highest luxury in my opinion.

2018
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:55,470
It is the Coco Chanel of programming languages.

2019
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:57,390
Something that not everyone can afford.

2020
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,250
And I mean this in the best possible way.

2021
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,620
There are some applications on the internet

2022
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:05,190
where each request has so little value,

2023
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:08,220
you can't afford to use a luxurious language

2024
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:09,660
like Ruby to program in it.

2025
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:13,590
You simply have to slum it with a C or a Go

2026
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:16,290
or some other low level language or Rust,

2027
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:17,167
talk about line noise there for...

2028
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:19,740
- It's like the thrift store of languages.

2029
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:22,303
- Exactly, where you need kind of just...

2030
01:24:22,303 --> 01:24:24,390
you need a very low level to do it.

2031
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,060
You can't afford to use a luxury language

2032
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:29,160
to use to build it with.

2033
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:30,570
That's not true of Shopify.

2034
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:33,993
It wasn't true of Basecamp even back in 2004.

2035
01:24:33,993 --> 01:24:36,690
It's not been true of 99%

2036
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:38,580
of all web applications ever created

2037
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:40,740
because the main cost component

2038
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,919
of 99% of web applications,

2039
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:44,571
it's not CPU course.

2040
01:24:44,571 --> 01:24:46,500
It's wet course.

2041
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:47,910
It's human course.

2042
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:52,170
It's human capacity to understand and involve systems.

2043
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:54,060
It's their personal productivity.

2044
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,680
I did a calculation once

2045
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,570
when someone had for the 400th time said that,

2046
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:02,100
"Oh, if you switch from Ruby to some faster language,

2047
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,207
you could save a bunch of money."

2048
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:05,180
And I calculated it out that at the time,

2049
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,440
and I think the last time I did this calculation

2050
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,450
was almost a decade ago.

2051
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:12,690
We were spending about 15% of our operating budget

2052
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,442
on Ruby application service.

2053
01:25:15,442 --> 01:25:20,442
So for me to improve my cost profile of the business

2054
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,810
by seven percentage points,

2055
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:26,910
I'd have to pick something twice as fast.

2056
01:25:26,910 --> 01:25:27,750
That's quite hard.

2057
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:30,540
Versus if Ruby and Ruby on Rails

2058
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:33,480
was even 10% more productive than something else,

2059
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:35,130
I would move the needle far more

2060
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,860
because making individual programmers more productive

2061
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,090
actually matters a lot more.

2062
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,863
This is why people are so excited about AI.

2063
01:25:40,863 --> 01:25:43,020
This is why they're freaking out

2064
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:46,500
over the fact that a single programmer in Silicon Valley

2065
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,927
who makes $300,000 a year

2066
01:25:48,927 --> 01:25:52,470
can now do the work of three or five, at least in theory.

2067
01:25:52,470 --> 01:25:54,000
I haven't actually seen that fully in practice,

2068
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,070
but let's just assume the theory is correct

2069
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:58,830
if not now, then in six months.

2070
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:00,630
That's a huge deal.

2071
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,940
That matters so much more

2072
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,130
than whether you can squeeze a few more cycles

2073
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:06,270
out of the CPU,

2074
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:08,400
when it comes to these kinds of business applications.

2075
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,420
If you're making unreal engine rendering stuff

2076
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,220
like Tim Sweeney you had on.

2077
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:16,770
Yeah, he needs to really sweat all those details.

2078
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:19,350
The Nanite engine can't run on Ruby.

2079
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:20,460
It's never going to.

2080
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:22,800
It would not meant for that, fine.

2081
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,380
These kinds of business applications absolutely can

2082
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:28,290
and everything that people are excited

2083
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:30,210
about AI for right now,

2084
01:26:30,210 --> 01:26:33,360
that extra capacity to just do more.

2085
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,100
That was why we were excited about Ruby

2086
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,930
back in the early 2000s.

2087
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:39,210
That was be because I saw

2088
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:40,363
that if we could even squeeze out

2089
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:44,133
a 10% improvement of the human programmer,

2090
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:47,820
we'd be able to do so much more for so much less.

2091
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:49,590
- Probably argue about this,

2092
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:54,240
but I really like working together with AI,

2093
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,320
collaborating with AI.

2094
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,870
And I would argue that the kind of code you want AI

2095
01:26:57,870 --> 01:27:00,623
to generate is human readable, human interpretable.

2096
01:27:00,623 --> 01:27:04,379
If it's generating Perl golf code,

2097
01:27:04,379 --> 01:27:07,320
it's not a collaboration.

2098
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,090
So it has to be speaking the human.

2099
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,850
It's not just you're writing the prompts in English.

2100
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:14,310
You also want to read the responses

2101
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:17,154
in the human interpretable language like Ruby, right?

2102
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:19,907
So that's actually is beneficial for AI too.

2103
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:23,760
'Cause you've kind of said that for you the sculptor,

2104
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,390
the sort of the elitist Coco Chanel sculptor,

2105
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:29,580
you want to on your fancy keyboard

2106
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,050
to type every single letter

2107
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:32,760
yourself of your own fingers.

2108
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,309
But it's also that the benefit

2109
01:27:36,309 --> 01:27:39,990
of Ruby also applies in once some of that is written by AI

2110
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,070
and you're actually doing

2111
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,464
with your own fingers the editing.

2112
01:27:43,464 --> 01:27:44,993
Because you can interact with it

2113
01:27:44,993 --> 01:27:47,010
because it's human interpretable.

2114
01:27:47,010 --> 01:27:48,330
- The paradigm I really love with this

2115
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:50,670
was something Elon actually said on one of your shows

2116
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:52,770
when you guys were talking about Neuralink,

2117
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:56,292
that Neuralink allows the bandwidth

2118
01:27:56,292 --> 01:27:59,580
between you and the machine to increase.

2119
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,950
That language either spoken or written

2120
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,660
is very low bandwidth.

2121
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:06,330
If you are to calculate just how many bits

2122
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:10,023
we can exchange as we are sitting here, it's very slow.

2123
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:14,730
Ruby has a much higher bandwidth

2124
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:18,150
of communication revealed conveys

2125
01:28:18,150 --> 01:28:22,470
so much more concept per character

2126
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:24,750
than most other programming languages do.

2127
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,270
So when you are collaborating with AI,

2128
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:29,160
you want really high bandwidth.

2129
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:32,922
You want it to be able to produce programs with you,

2130
01:28:32,922 --> 01:28:36,330
whether you're letting it write the code or not,

2131
01:28:36,330 --> 01:28:39,960
that both of you can actually understand really quickly

2132
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:44,464
and that you could compress a grand concept,

2133
01:28:44,464 --> 01:28:48,111
a grand system into far fewer parts

2134
01:28:48,111 --> 01:28:49,620
that both of you can understand.

2135
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:52,290
Now, I actually love collaborating with AI too.

2136
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:53,940
I love chiseling my code

2137
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:57,510
and the way I use AI is in a separate window.

2138
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:58,920
I don't let it drive my code.

2139
01:28:58,920 --> 01:28:59,753
I've tried that.

2140
01:28:59,753 --> 01:29:01,200
I've tried the cursors and the wind surfaces

2141
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:03,750
and I don't enjoy that way of writing.

2142
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,490
And one of the reasons I don't enjoy

2143
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:09,660
that way of writing is I can literally feel competence

2144
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:12,000
draining out of my fingers.

2145
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,210
Like that level of immediacy

2146
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:17,580
with the material disappears.

2147
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:22,200
And the where I felt this the most was I did this remix

2148
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:25,800
of Ubuntu called Omakub when I switched to Linux,

2149
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,570
and it's all written in Bash.

2150
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:29,640
I'd never written any serious

2151
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,380
amount of code in Bash before.

2152
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,970
So I was using AI to collaborate,

2153
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:34,697
to write a bunch of Bash with me,

2154
01:29:34,697 --> 01:29:35,880
'cause I needed all this.

2155
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,290
I knew what I wanted.

2156
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:39,090
I could express it in Ruby.

2157
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:41,250
But I thought it was an interesting challenge

2158
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:43,240
to filter through Bash because what I was doing

2159
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,600
was setting up a Linux machine.

2160
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,880
That's basically what Bash was designed for.

2161
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,530
It's a great constraint.

2162
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:52,980
But what I found myself doing was asking AI

2163
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:55,440
for the same way of expressing a conditional,

2164
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,170
for example, in Bash over and over again.

2165
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:01,770
That by not typing it, I wasn't learning it.

2166
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:05,460
I was using it, I was getting the expression I wanted,

2167
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,960
but I wasn't learning it.

2168
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,640
And I got a little scared.

2169
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,650
I got a little scared like,

2170
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,340
is this the end of learning?

2171
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,530
Am I no longer learning if I'm not typing?

2172
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:16,770
And the way I, for me, recast that

2173
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,663
was, I don't wanna give up on the AI.

2174
01:30:18,663 --> 01:30:21,450
It's such a better experience as a programmer

2175
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:26,450
to look up APIs, to get a second opinion on something,

2176
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:28,350
to do a draft.

2177
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,000
But I have to do the typing myself

2178
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,340
because you learn with your fingers.

2179
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:34,200
If you're learning how to play the guitar,

2180
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,780
you can watch as many YouTube videos as you want.

2181
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:38,490
You're not gonna learn the guitar.

2182
01:30:38,490 --> 01:30:41,935
You have to put your fingers on the strings

2183
01:30:41,935 --> 01:30:44,250
to actually learn the motions.

2184
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:46,260
And I think there is a parallel here to programming

2185
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:48,930
where programming has to be learned in part

2186
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:50,670
by the actual typing.

2187
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:53,105
- I'm just really, this is fascinating.

2188
01:30:53,105 --> 01:30:55,410
Listen, part of my brain agrees with you.

2189
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:57,033
100% part doesn't.

2190
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,310
I think AI should be in the loop of learning.

2191
01:31:02,310 --> 01:31:05,880
Now current systems don't do that,

2192
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,853
but I think it's very possible for cursor to say,

2193
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,570
to basically force you to type certain things.

2194
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:14,850
So like if you set the mode of learning,

2195
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:19,850
I don't want to be this sort of give up on AI.

2196
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:24,960
I think vibe coding is a skill.

2197
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,125
So for an experienced programmer

2198
01:31:28,125 --> 01:31:31,110
it's too easy to dismiss vibe coding as a thing.

2199
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,460
- [DHH] I agree, I wouldn't dismiss it.

2200
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:35,590
- But I think you need to start building that skill

2201
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,980
and start to figure out

2202
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:41,370
how do you prevent the competency from slipping away

2203
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,170
from your fingers and brain.

2204
01:31:43,170 --> 01:31:45,540
Like how do you develop that skill in parallel

2205
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,730
to the other skill?

2206
01:31:47,730 --> 01:31:48,837
I don't know.

2207
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,120
I think it's a fascinating puzzle though.

2208
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,760
I know too many really strong programmers

2209
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,647
that just kind of avoid AI,

2210
01:31:54,647 --> 01:31:57,390
'cause it's currently a little too dumb.

2211
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,800
- Yes, it's a little too slow.

2212
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,240
It's actually my main problem.

2213
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:01,590
It's a little too dumb in some ways,

2214
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,240
but it's a little too slow in other ways.

2215
01:32:03,240 --> 01:32:07,043
When I use Claude's code,

2216
01:32:07,043 --> 01:32:10,170
the terminal version of a Claude,

2217
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:12,405
which is actually my preferred way of using it,

2218
01:32:12,405 --> 01:32:14,100
I get too impatient.

2219
01:32:14,100 --> 01:32:16,290
It feels like I'm going back to a time

2220
01:32:16,290 --> 01:32:17,970
where code had to compile

2221
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:19,770
and I had to go do something else.

2222
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:21,840
A boil some tea while the code is compiling.

2223
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,210
Well, I've been working in Ruby for 20 years.

2224
01:32:24,210 --> 01:32:28,470
I don't have compiled weight in me anymore.

2225
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:30,090
So there's that aspect of it.

2226
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:31,800
But I think the more crucial aspect

2227
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:34,350
for me is I really care about the competence.

2228
01:32:34,350 --> 01:32:37,256
And I've seen what happens to even great programmers

2229
01:32:37,256 --> 01:32:39,960
the moment they put away the keyboard.

2230
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,640
Because even before AI,

2231
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,490
this would happen as soon as people would get promoted.

2232
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:47,970
Most great programmers who work in large businesses

2233
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:50,040
stop writing code on a daily basis

2234
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,813
because they simply have too many meetings to attend to.

2235
01:32:51,813 --> 01:32:53,670
They have too many other things to do.

2236
01:32:53,670 --> 01:32:57,960
And invariably they lose touch with programming.

2237
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,840
That doesn't mean they forget everything.

2238
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:05,840
But if you don't have your fingers in the sauce, source,

2239
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:08,370
you are going to lose touch with it.

2240
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:09,570
There's just no other way.

2241
01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:12,450
I don't want that because I enjoy it too much.

2242
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,730
This is not just about outcomes.

2243
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,709
This is what's crucial to understand

2244
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:20,640
programming for programmers who like to code

2245
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,400
is not just about the programs they get out of it.

2246
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:25,470
That may be the economic value.

2247
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:27,000
It's not the only human value.

2248
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,063
The human value is just much in the expression.

2249
01:33:31,530 --> 01:33:34,590
When someone who sits down on a guitar

2250
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:36,360
and plays "Stairway to Heaven,"

2251
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,040
there's a perfect recording

2252
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,140
of that that will last in eternity.

2253
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:41,640
You can just put it on Spotify.

2254
01:33:41,640 --> 01:33:42,960
You don't actually need to do it.

2255
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,800
The joy is to command the guitar yourself.

2256
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,010
The joy of a programmer, of me as a programmer,

2257
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:51,420
is to type the code myself.

2258
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:52,560
If I elevate myself,

2259
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:55,650
if I promote myself out of programming,

2260
01:33:55,650 --> 01:33:57,690
I turn myself into a project manager.

2261
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:00,930
A project manager of a murder of AI crows

2262
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:02,400
as I wrote the other day.

2263
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,820
I could have been become a project manager my whole career.

2264
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:08,130
I could have become a project manager 20 years ago

2265
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,750
if I didn't care to write code myself.

2266
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,190
And I just wanted outcomes.

2267
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:12,720
That's how I got started in programming.

2268
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,370
I just wanted outcomes.

2269
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:16,770
Then I fell in love with programming

2270
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:19,435
and now I'd rather retire than giving it up.

2271
01:34:19,435 --> 01:34:21,000
Now that doesn't mean

2272
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,680
you can't have your cake and needed to.

2273
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:24,690
I've done some vibe coding

2274
01:34:24,690 --> 01:34:28,860
where I didn't care that I wasn't playing myself.

2275
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:30,120
I just wanted to see something.

2276
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,590
There was an idea in my head.

2277
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:33,600
I wanted to see something.

2278
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:34,590
That's fine.

2279
01:34:34,590 --> 01:34:37,260
I also use AI all day long.

2280
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,700
In fact, I'm already at the point

2281
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:40,230
where if you took it away from me,

2282
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:41,670
I'd be like, oh my god,

2283
01:34:41,670 --> 01:34:43,620
how do we even look things up on the internet anymore?

2284
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:46,410
Is Stack Overflow still around?

2285
01:34:46,410 --> 01:34:47,820
Or I'm still a thing?

2286
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,440
Like how do I even find answers

2287
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,510
to some of these questions I have all day long.

2288
01:34:51,510 --> 01:34:52,740
I don't wanna give up AI.

2289
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:55,950
In fact, I'd say the way I like to use AI,

2290
01:34:55,950 --> 01:34:58,170
I'm getting smarter every because of AI.

2291
01:34:58,170 --> 01:35:02,490
Because I'm using AI to have it explain things to me.

2292
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:04,020
Even stupid questions.

2293
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:05,340
I would be a little embarrassed

2294
01:35:05,340 --> 01:35:07,656
to even enter into Google.

2295
01:35:07,656 --> 01:35:12,656
AI is perfectly willing to give me the ELI5 explanation

2296
01:35:12,930 --> 01:35:14,130
of some Unix command.

2297
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:15,630
I should have known already,

2298
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:17,220
but I don't, I'm sorry,

2299
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,800
can you just explain it to me and now I know the thing.

2300
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:23,369
So at the end of the day of me working with AI all day long,

2301
01:35:23,369 --> 01:35:25,020
I'm a little bit smarter.

2302
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:29,460
Like 5%, sorry, not 5%, half a percent maybe.

2303
01:35:29,460 --> 01:35:31,290
That compounds over time.

2304
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:32,550
But what I've also seen,

2305
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:34,260
when I worked on the Omakub project

2306
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,810
and I tried to let AI drive for me,

2307
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:39,900
I felt I was maybe half a percent dumber

2308
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,160
at the end of the day.

2309
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:42,720
- Okay, you said a lot of interesting things.

2310
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,850
First of all, let's just start at the very fact

2311
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:46,860
that asking dumb questions.

2312
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,820
If you go to Stack Overflow

2313
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:49,590
and ask a dumb question

2314
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:52,710
or read somebody else's dumb question and the answer to it,

2315
01:35:52,710 --> 01:35:54,270
there's a lot of judgment there.

2316
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:58,470
AI sometimes to an excessive degree has no judgment.

2317
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:00,600
It usually says, oh, that's a great question.

2318
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,190
- [DHH] To a fault.

2319
01:36:02,190 --> 01:36:04,173
- Yeah, oh, that's wonderful.

2320
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:10,190
Yeah, I mean, it's so conducive to learning.

2321
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:12,147
It's such a wonderful tool of learning

2322
01:36:12,147 --> 01:36:13,557
and I too would miss it.

2323
01:36:13,557 --> 01:36:16,410
And it's a great basically search engine

2324
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:18,060
into all kinds of nuances

2325
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:19,980
of a particular programming language,

2326
01:36:19,980 --> 01:36:22,110
especially if you don't know it that well

2327
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:24,600
or like APIs you can load in documentation.

2328
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,460
It's just so great for learning.

2329
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,040
I, for me personally...

2330
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,850
I mean, on the happiness scale,

2331
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:34,833
it makes me more excited to program.

2332
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,830
I don't know what that is exactly.

2333
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:40,410
Part of that is the, I'm really sorry.

2334
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:42,900
Stack Overflow is an incredible website,

2335
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,850
but there is a negativity there.

2336
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:45,900
There's a judgment there.

2337
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:50,160
It's just exciting to be out like with a hype man

2338
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:53,880
next to me, just like saying, yeah, that's a great idea.

2339
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:55,710
And I'll say, no, that's wrong.

2340
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:57,206
I'll correct the AI,

2341
01:36:57,206 --> 01:37:00,750
and the AI will say, "You're absolutely right.

2342
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:02,308
How did I not think about that?"

2343
01:37:02,308 --> 01:37:03,267
You know, rewrite the code.

2344
01:37:03,267 --> 01:37:06,780
I'm like, holy shit, I'm having, that's like a buddy.

2345
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:09,450
That's like really being positive

2346
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:12,120
and is very smart and is challenging me to think.

2347
01:37:12,120 --> 01:37:15,000
And even if I never use the code it generates,

2348
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,440
I'm already a better programmer.

2349
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:20,160
But actually the deeper thing is for some reason

2350
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,720
I'm having more fun.

2351
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:23,490
That's a really, really important thing.

2352
01:37:23,490 --> 01:37:25,140
- I like to think of it as a pair programmer

2353
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:26,940
for exactly that reason.

2354
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:30,480
Pair programming came a vogue in like the 2000s.

2355
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:33,030
Where you'd have two programmers in front of one machine

2356
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:35,820
and you'd push the keyboard between you.

2357
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:38,880
One programmer would be driving, they'd be typing in.

2358
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,470
The other programmer would essentially sit

2359
01:37:40,470 --> 01:37:41,303
and watch the code,

2360
01:37:41,303 --> 01:37:43,972
suggest improvements, look something up.

2361
01:37:43,972 --> 01:37:46,620
That was a really interesting dynamic.

2362
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:47,970
Now unfortunately, I'm an introvert,

2363
01:37:47,970 --> 01:37:49,470
so I can do that for about five minutes

2364
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:51,691
before I want to jump off a bridge.

2365
01:37:51,691 --> 01:37:54,715
So it doesn't work for me as a full-time occupation.

2366
01:37:54,715 --> 01:37:57,480
But AI allows me to have all the best

2367
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,550
of that experience all the time.

2368
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,383
Now I think what's really interesting,

2369
01:38:00,383 --> 01:38:02,850
what you said about it makes it more fun.

2370
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:04,020
I hadn't actually thought about that,

2371
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:09,020
but what it's made more fun to me is to be a beginner again.

2372
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:12,391
It made it more fun to learn Bash

2373
01:38:12,391 --> 01:38:14,490
successfully for the first time.

2374
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:16,050
Now I had to do the detour

2375
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,490
where I let it write all the code for me

2376
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:20,040
and I realized I wasn't learning nearly as much

2377
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,240
as I hoped I would

2378
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,366
and that I started doing once I typed it out myself.

2379
01:38:24,366 --> 01:38:27,090
But it gave me the confidence that, you know what?

2380
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:29,787
If I need to do some iOS programming myself,

2381
01:38:29,787 --> 01:38:32,490
I haven't done that in probably six years

2382
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:33,733
was the last time I dabbled in it.

2383
01:38:33,733 --> 01:38:35,730
I never really built anything for real.

2384
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:38,590
I feel highly confident now that I could sit down with AI

2385
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:40,530
and I could have something in the app store

2386
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:41,880
by the end of the week.

2387
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,800
I would not have that confidence

2388
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:46,650
unless I had a pair of programming body like AI.

2389
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:49,470
I don't actually use it very much for Ruby code.

2390
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:50,790
I'm occasionally impressed

2391
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,990
whenever I try it, they're like,

2392
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:53,310
oh, it got this one thing right.

2393
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:55,917
That is truly remarkable and it's actually pretty good.

2394
01:38:55,917 --> 01:38:57,600
And then I'll ask you two more questions

2395
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:59,130
and I go like, oh yeah, okay.

2396
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:01,470
If you were my junior programmer,

2397
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:02,940
I'd start tapping my fingers

2398
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:05,160
and going like, you gotta shape up.

2399
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,180
Now the great thing of course

2400
01:39:06,180 --> 01:39:08,670
is we can just wait five minutes.

2401
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:12,630
The Anthropic CEO seems to think that 90% of all code

2402
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:14,250
by the end of the year is gonna be written by AI.

2403
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:16,650
I am more than a little bit skeptical about that,

2404
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:19,170
but I'm open-minded about the prospect

2405
01:39:19,170 --> 01:39:22,260
that programming potentially

2406
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:25,860
will turn into a horse when done manually.

2407
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,630
Something we do recreationally

2408
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:30,930
is no longer a mode of transportation to get around LA.

2409
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:32,400
You're not gonna saddle up

2410
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,110
and go to the grocery store

2411
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:35,957
and pick up stuff from whole foods in your saddlebacks.

2412
01:39:35,957 --> 01:39:37,860
That's just not a thing anymore.

2413
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,650
That could be the future for programming,

2414
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:44,070
for manual programming entirely possible.

2415
01:39:44,070 --> 01:39:45,630
I also don't care.

2416
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,910
Like even though we have great renditions

2417
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:49,860
of all the best songs, as I said,

2418
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,740
there are millions of people who love to play the guitar.

2419
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:55,590
It may no longer have as much economic value as it once did.

2420
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:59,160
I think that I'm quite convinced is true

2421
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,050
that we perhaps have seen the peak.

2422
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:02,910
Now I understand the paradox,

2423
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:04,530
when the price of something goes down,

2424
01:40:04,530 --> 01:40:06,510
actually the overall usage goes up

2425
01:40:06,510 --> 01:40:09,270
and total spend on that activity goes up.

2426
01:40:09,270 --> 01:40:10,920
That could also happen maybe.

2427
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:12,660
But what we're seeing right now

2428
01:40:12,660 --> 01:40:16,800
is that a lot of the big shops, a lot of the big companies

2429
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,470
are not hiring like they were five years ago.

2430
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:21,630
They're not anticipating they're gonna need

2431
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:23,190
tons more programmers.

2432
01:40:23,190 --> 01:40:27,090
Controversially, Tobi actually put out a memo

2433
01:40:27,090 --> 01:40:29,040
inside of Shopify asking everyone

2434
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,510
who's considering hiring someone

2435
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:33,090
to ask the question, could this be done by AI?

2436
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:35,700
Now, he's further ahead on this question than I am.

2437
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,530
I look at some of the coding trenches

2438
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:39,840
and I go like, I'd love to use AI more,

2439
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,400
and I see how it's making us more productive,

2440
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,230
but it's not yet at the level

2441
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:44,760
where I just go like, oh, we have this project.

2442
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:46,223
Let me just give it to the AI agent

2443
01:40:46,223 --> 01:40:47,700
and it's gonna go off and do it.

2444
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,110
- But let's just be honest.

2445
01:40:49,110 --> 01:40:51,150
You're like a Clint-Eastwood type character cowboy

2446
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:54,807
and on a horse seeing cars going around

2447
01:40:54,807 --> 01:40:56,130
and you're like, well.

2448
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:57,150
- That's part of it.

2449
01:40:57,150 --> 01:40:59,910
And I think that's, it is important to have that humility

2450
01:40:59,910 --> 01:41:01,620
that what you are good at

2451
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:05,040
may no longer be what society values.

2452
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,260
This has happened a million times in history

2453
01:41:07,260 --> 01:41:09,120
that you could have been exceptionally good

2454
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,740
at saddle making, for example.

2455
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:12,750
That's something that a lot of people used to care about

2456
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:14,460
because everyone rode a horse.

2457
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:18,962
And then suddenly riding a horse became this niche hobby

2458
01:41:18,962 --> 01:41:20,550
that there's some people care about it,

2459
01:41:20,550 --> 01:41:22,050
but not nearly as many.

2460
01:41:22,050 --> 01:41:22,950
That's okay.

2461
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:23,970
Now the other thing of this

2462
01:41:23,970 --> 01:41:27,180
is I've had the good fortune to...

2463
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:28,723
I've been a programmer for nearly 30 years.

2464
01:41:28,723 --> 01:41:30,630
That was a great run.

2465
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:33,060
I try to look at life in this way

2466
01:41:33,060 --> 01:41:35,550
that I've already been blessed

2467
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:38,760
with decades of economically viable,

2468
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:43,760
highly valuable ways of translating what I like best

2469
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:47,310
in the working world to write Ruby code.

2470
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,630
That that was so valuable

2471
01:41:48,630 --> 01:41:51,267
that I could make millions and millions of dollars doing it.

2472
01:41:51,267 --> 01:41:53,088
And if that's over tomorrow,

2473
01:41:53,088 --> 01:41:55,050
I shouldn't look at that with regret.

2474
01:41:55,050 --> 01:41:57,120
I should look at it with gratitude.

2475
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:01,500
- But you're also a highly experienced, brilliant

2476
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:04,470
and opinionated human being,

2477
01:42:04,470 --> 01:42:07,590
so it's really interesting to get your opinion

2478
01:42:07,590 --> 01:42:09,780
on the future of the horse

2479
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:11,100
because it, you know,

2480
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:12,720
there's a lot of young people listening to this

2481
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:14,730
who love programming or who are excited

2482
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:17,493
by the possibility of building stuff with software,

2483
01:42:19,785 --> 01:42:22,200
with Ruby on Rails, that kind of language.

2484
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,467
This and now the possibility.

2485
01:42:24,467 --> 01:42:29,297
- But is it a career? - Is it a career?

2486
01:42:29,297 --> 01:42:32,310
And if indeed a single person can build

2487
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:34,980
more and more and more with the help of AI,

2488
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:36,900
like how do they learn that skill?

2489
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,670
Is this a good skill to learn?

2490
01:42:38,670 --> 01:42:41,460
I mean, that to me is the real mystery here,

2491
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:44,070
because I think it's still absolutely true

2492
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:45,840
that you have to learn how to program

2493
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:47,870
from scratch currently.

2494
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:50,910
But how do you balance those two skills?

2495
01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:53,730
Because I too, as I'm thinking now,

2496
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:57,630
there is a scary slipping away of skill that happens.

2497
01:42:57,630 --> 01:43:00,930
In a matter of like really minutes

2498
01:43:00,930 --> 01:43:02,433
on a particular piece of code.

2499
01:43:03,690 --> 01:43:04,680
It's scary.

2500
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:08,163
Not the way driving, you know,

2501
01:43:08,163 --> 01:43:11,430
when you have a car drive for you

2502
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:14,910
doesn't quite slip away that fast.

2503
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:16,560
So that really scares me.

2504
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,090
So when somebody comes up to me

2505
01:43:18,090 --> 01:43:20,430
and asks me like, how do I learn to program,

2506
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:21,470
I don't know what the advice

2507
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:24,690
is because I think it's not enough

2508
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:28,950
to just use cursor or copilot to generate code.

2509
01:43:28,950 --> 01:43:30,306
- It's absolutely not enough.

2510
01:43:30,306 --> 01:43:31,350
Not if you wanna learn,

2511
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:33,060
none of you want to become better at it.

2512
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:35,185
If you just become a tap monkey,

2513
01:43:35,185 --> 01:43:37,350
maybe you're productive in a second.

2514
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:38,490
But then you have to realize,

2515
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:40,110
well, can anyone just tap?

2516
01:43:40,110 --> 01:43:40,943
If that's all we're doing

2517
01:43:40,943 --> 01:43:43,050
is just sitting around all day long tapping?

2518
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,610
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2519
01:43:44,610 --> 01:43:46,710
That's not a marketable skill.

2520
01:43:46,710 --> 01:43:50,100
Now, I always preface this both to myself

2521
01:43:50,100 --> 01:43:51,270
and when I speak to others,

2522
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:55,380
it is rule number note one, nobody fucking knows anything.

2523
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,990
No one can predict even six months ahead.

2524
01:43:57,990 --> 01:44:01,770
Right now, we're probably at peak AI future hype

2525
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:03,210
because we see all the promise,

2526
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:05,160
because so much of it is real

2527
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:07,620
and so many people have experienced it themselves.

2528
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:10,910
This mind boggling thing

2529
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,180
that the silicon is thinking in some way

2530
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:17,970
that feels eerily reminiscent of humans.

2531
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:19,890
I'd actually say the big thing

2532
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:21,050
for me wasn't even ChatGPT.

2533
01:44:21,050 --> 01:44:22,200
It wasn't even Claude.

2534
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,460
It was DeepSeek.

2535
01:44:23,460 --> 01:44:24,930
Running DeepSeek locally

2536
01:44:24,930 --> 01:44:26,970
and seeing the think box

2537
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:29,760
where it converses with itself

2538
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:33,130
about how to formulate the response.

2539
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:35,880
I almost wanted to think, is this a gimmick?

2540
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,910
Is it doing this as a performance for my benefit?

2541
01:44:38,910 --> 01:44:40,590
But that's not actually how it thinks.

2542
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:42,150
If this is how it actually thinks,

2543
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:43,530
okay, I'm a little scared.

2544
01:44:43,530 --> 01:44:47,827
This is incredibly human how it thinks in this way.

2545
01:44:47,827 --> 01:44:49,770
But where does that go?

2546
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:53,760
So in '95, 1 of my favorite movies,

2547
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,747
one of my favorite B movies came out,

2548
01:44:55,747 --> 01:44:57,360
"The Lawnmower Man." - Great movie.

2549
01:44:57,360 --> 01:44:59,860
- Incredible movie about virtual reality.

2550
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:02,310
Being an avatar and living in VR,

2551
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:03,600
like the story was a mess.

2552
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,600
But the aesthetics the world had built up was incredible.

2553
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,720
And I thought, we're five years away.

2554
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:11,670
I'm gonna be living in VR now.

2555
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:13,410
I'm just gonna be floating around.

2556
01:45:13,410 --> 01:45:15,296
I'm gonna be an avatar.

2557
01:45:15,296 --> 01:45:17,430
This is where most humans can spend most of the day

2558
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:19,410
that didn't happen.

2559
01:45:19,410 --> 01:45:21,210
We're 30 years later,

2560
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:25,050
VR is still not here.

2561
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:26,250
It's here for gaming.

2562
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,130
It's here for some specialized applications.

2563
01:45:29,130 --> 01:45:32,343
My oldest loves playing Gorilla Tag.

2564
01:45:32,343 --> 01:45:33,176
I dunno if you've tried that.

2565
01:45:33,176 --> 01:45:35,370
That's basically the hottest VR game.

2566
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:37,440
Wonderful, it's great.

2567
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:39,690
It's really hard to predict the future

2568
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,515
'cause we just don't know.

2569
01:45:41,515 --> 01:45:42,690
And then when you factor in AI

2570
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:47,250
and you have even the smartest people go like,

2571
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,560
I don't think we fully understand how this works.

2572
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,460
- But then on the flip side,

2573
01:45:50,460 --> 01:45:53,070
you have Moore's Law that seems to have worked

2574
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:55,500
for many, many, many years

2575
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:58,023
in decreasing the size of transistor, for example.

2576
01:45:58,023 --> 01:46:03,023
So like you know, Flash didn't take over the internet,

2577
01:46:03,096 --> 01:46:05,400
but Moore's Law worked.

2578
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:06,810
So we don't know

2579
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:08,340
which one AI is. - Which one it is.

2580
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:10,410
And this is what I find so fascinating too.

2581
01:46:10,410 --> 01:46:12,000
I forget who did this presentation,

2582
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:13,470
but someone in the web community,

2583
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:17,874
this great presentation on the history of the airplane.

2584
01:46:17,874 --> 01:46:20,700
So you go from the Wright brothers flying in, what?

2585
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:22,830
1903 or something like that.

2586
01:46:22,830 --> 01:46:27,150
And 40 years later you have a jet flight.

2587
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:31,770
Just an unbelievable amount of progress in four decades.

2588
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:34,560
Then in '56, I think it was,

2589
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:39,150
the halt the sign for the Boeing 747

2590
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:41,490
essentially precursor was designed

2591
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:43,260
and basically nothing has happened since.

2592
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,480
Just minor tweaks and improvements

2593
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,870
on the flying experience since the '50s.

2594
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:52,020
Somehow, if you were to predict where flying

2595
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:54,450
was gonna go, and you were sitting in 42

2596
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:56,730
and you'd seen, you'd remember

2597
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:58,860
the Wright brothers flying in '03,

2598
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,170
and you were seeing that jet engines coming,

2599
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:03,600
you're like, we're gonna fly to to the stars

2600
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:04,710
in another two decades.

2601
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:08,610
We're gonna invent super mega hypersonic flights

2602
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:11,326
that's gonna traverse the earth in two hours.

2603
01:47:11,326 --> 01:47:12,630
And then that didn't happen.

2604
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:13,890
It tapped out.

2605
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:16,440
This is what's so hard about predicting the future.

2606
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:18,030
We can be so excited in the moment

2607
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:22,530
because we're drawing a line through early dots on a chart,

2608
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:23,880
and it looks like those early dots

2609
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:24,870
are just going up into the right,

2610
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:26,670
and sometimes it's just flatten out.

2611
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:28,080
This is also one of those things

2612
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:30,990
where we have so much critical infrastructure, for example,

2613
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:32,370
that still runs on COBOL.

2614
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:33,570
That about five humans

2615
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:36,390
around the world really understand truly, deeply

2616
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:38,400
that there's a lot, it's possible

2617
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,320
for society to lose a competence.

2618
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:44,610
It's still needs because it's chasing the future.

2619
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:46,290
COBOL is still with us.

2620
01:47:46,290 --> 01:47:47,730
This is one of the things I think about

2621
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:49,170
with with programming.

2622
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:51,323
Ruby on Rails is at such a level now

2623
01:47:51,323 --> 01:47:53,040
that in 50 years from now,

2624
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,920
it's exceedingly likely that there's still a ton

2625
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:57,297
of Ruby on Rail systems running around.

2626
01:47:57,297 --> 01:47:58,530
And very hard to predict

2627
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:00,354
what that exact world is gonna be like.

2628
01:48:00,354 --> 01:48:02,220
But yesterday's weather tells us

2629
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:04,922
that if there's still COBOL code from the '70s

2630
01:48:04,922 --> 01:48:07,530
operating social security today,

2631
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:10,260
and we haven't figured out a clean way to convert that,

2632
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:12,675
let alone understand it,

2633
01:48:12,675 --> 01:48:16,470
we should certainly be humble about predicting the future.

2634
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:18,060
I don't think any of the programmers

2635
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:20,340
who wrote that COBOL code back in the '70s

2636
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:23,010
had any damn idea that in 2025,

2637
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:25,800
checks were still being cut off the business logic

2638
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,360
that they had encoded back then.

2639
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:30,360
But that just brings me to the conclusion on the question

2640
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,490
for what should a young programmer do?

2641
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:34,110
You're not gonna be able to predict the future.

2642
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:36,270
No one's gonna be able to predict the future.

2643
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:38,820
If you like programming, you should learn programming.

2644
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,500
Now, is that gonna be a career forever?

2645
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,870
I don't know, but what's gonna be a career forever?

2646
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:44,013
Who knows?

2647
01:48:44,013 --> 01:48:45,355
Like a second ago,

2648
01:48:45,355 --> 01:48:48,540
we thought that it was the blue collar labor

2649
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:49,667
that was gonna be extracted first.

2650
01:48:49,667 --> 01:48:52,020
It was the robots that were gonna take over.

2651
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:53,880
Then GenAI comes out,

2652
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,537
and then all the artists suddenly look like,

2653
01:48:55,537 --> 01:48:58,080
"Holy shit, is this gonna do all animation now?

2654
01:48:58,080 --> 01:48:59,700
Is gonna do all music now?"

2655
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,870
They get real scared.

2656
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:03,500
And now I see the latest Tesla robot going like,

2657
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:06,630
oh, maybe we're back now to blue collar being in trouble.

2658
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,430
Because if it can dance like that,

2659
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:11,250
it can probably fix a toilet.

2660
01:49:11,250 --> 01:49:13,611
So no one knows anything,

2661
01:49:13,611 --> 01:49:17,160
and you have to then position yourself for the future

2662
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:21,330
in such a way that it doesn't matter

2663
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:24,270
that you pick a profession or path

2664
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:28,320
where if it turns out that you have to retool and re-skill,

2665
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,360
you're not gonna regret the path you took.

2666
01:49:30,360 --> 01:49:32,580
That's a general life principle.

2667
01:49:32,580 --> 01:49:36,120
For me, how I look at all endeavors I involve myself in

2668
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:39,600
is I want to be content with all outcomes.

2669
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:42,720
When we start working on a new product at 37signals,

2670
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:45,750
I set up my mental model for its success.

2671
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:47,250
And I go, do you know what?

2672
01:49:47,250 --> 01:49:51,270
If no one wants this, I will have had another opportunity

2673
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:53,340
to write beautiful Ruby code,

2674
01:49:53,340 --> 01:49:55,140
to explore Greenfield domain,

2675
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:56,580
to learn something new,

2676
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:59,610
to build a system I want, even if no one else wants it.

2677
01:49:59,610 --> 01:50:01,650
What a blessing.

2678
01:50:01,650 --> 01:50:03,270
What a privilege.

2679
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:06,060
If a bunch of people want it, that's great.

2680
01:50:06,060 --> 01:50:09,450
We can pay some salaries, we can keep the business running,

2681
01:50:09,450 --> 01:50:12,030
and if it's a blow away success, wonderful.

2682
01:50:12,030 --> 01:50:13,560
I get to impact a bunch of people.

2683
01:50:13,560 --> 01:50:15,935
- I think one of the big open questions to me

2684
01:50:15,935 --> 01:50:19,920
is how far you can get with vibe coding,

2685
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,106
whether an approach for a young developer to invest

2686
01:50:23,106 --> 01:50:24,990
most of the time it's into vibe coding

2687
01:50:24,990 --> 01:50:27,453
or into writing code from scratch.

2688
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,810
So vibe coding, meaning,

2689
01:50:30,810 --> 01:50:32,730
so I'm leaning into the meme a little bit,

2690
01:50:32,730 --> 01:50:36,300
but the vibe coding, meaning you generate code,

2691
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:38,430
you have this idea of a thing you want to create,

2692
01:50:38,430 --> 01:50:41,430
you generate the code and then you fix it

2693
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:44,370
with both natural language to the prompts and manually.

2694
01:50:44,370 --> 01:50:46,736
You learn enough to manually fix it.

2695
01:50:46,736 --> 01:50:48,360
So that's the learning process.

2696
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:50,550
How you fix code that's generated,

2697
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:55,260
or you write code from scratch

2698
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:59,190
and have the LMS kind of tab, tab, tab, tab,

2699
01:50:59,190 --> 01:51:00,750
add extra code.

2700
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:03,690
Like which part do you lean on?

2701
01:51:03,690 --> 01:51:07,710
I think to be safe, you should find the beauty

2702
01:51:07,710 --> 01:51:11,130
and the artistry and the skill

2703
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:12,630
in both right from scratch.

2704
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:13,740
So like there should be some percent

2705
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:15,150
of your time just writing from scratch

2706
01:51:15,150 --> 01:51:16,680
and some percent vibe coding.

2707
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:19,590
- There should be more of the time writing from scratch.

2708
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:22,230
If you are interested in learning how to program,

2709
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:24,120
unfortunately you're not gonna get fit

2710
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,980
by watching fitness videos.

2711
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:27,720
You're not gonna learn how to play the guitar

2712
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,550
by watching YouTube guitar videos.

2713
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:31,530
You have to actually play yourself.

2714
01:51:31,530 --> 01:51:33,840
You have to do the sit ups.

2715
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:34,980
Programming, understanding,

2716
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:37,943
learning almost anything requires you to do.

2717
01:51:37,943 --> 01:51:41,048
Humans are not built to absorb information

2718
01:51:41,048 --> 01:51:43,321
in a way that transforms into skills

2719
01:51:43,321 --> 01:51:45,810
by just watching others from afar.

2720
01:51:45,810 --> 01:51:48,257
Now ironically, it seems AI is actually quite good at that,

2721
01:51:48,257 --> 01:51:49,950
but humans are not.

2722
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:52,803
If you wanna learn how to become a competent programmer,

2723
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:55,410
you have to program.

2724
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:58,620
It's really not that difficult to understand.

2725
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:00,390
Now I understand the temptation.

2726
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:01,800
And the temptation is there

2727
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:04,260
because vibe coding can produce things.

2728
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:05,280
Perhaps in this moment,

2729
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,230
especially in a new domain you're not familiar with,

2730
01:52:07,230 --> 01:52:09,420
with tools you don't know perfectly well,

2731
01:52:09,420 --> 01:52:10,553
that's better than what you could do.

2732
01:52:10,553 --> 01:52:14,010
Or that you would take much longer to get at,

2733
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:15,540
but you're not gonna learn anything.

2734
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:18,330
You're gonna learn in this superficial way

2735
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:19,830
that feels like learning,

2736
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:22,050
but is completely empty calories.

2737
01:52:22,050 --> 01:52:25,650
And secondly, if you can just vibe code it,

2738
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:26,790
you're not a programmer.

2739
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:29,070
Then anyone could do it, which may be wonderful.

2740
01:52:29,070 --> 01:52:31,740
That's essentially what happened with the Access database.

2741
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:33,360
That's what happened with Excel.

2742
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:37,170
It took the capacity of accountants

2743
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:39,450
to become software developers

2744
01:52:39,450 --> 01:52:41,550
because the tools became so accessible to them

2745
01:52:41,550 --> 01:52:43,110
that they could build a model

2746
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:45,120
for how the business was gonna do next week.

2747
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:47,983
That required a programmer prior to Excel.

2748
01:52:47,983 --> 01:52:50,250
Now it didn't because they could do it themselves

2749
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:54,900
by coding enables non-programmers

2750
01:52:54,900 --> 01:52:56,760
to explore their ideas

2751
01:52:56,760 --> 01:52:59,436
in a way that I find absolutely wonderful.

2752
01:52:59,436 --> 01:53:02,040
But it doesn't make your a programmer.

2753
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:04,770
- I agree with you, but I wanna allow for room

2754
01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:06,300
for both of us to be wrong.

2755
01:53:06,300 --> 01:53:09,060
For example, there could be,

2756
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:11,610
vibe coding could actually be a skill.

2757
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:14,130
That if you train it, and by vibe coding,

2758
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:16,680
let's include the step of correction,

2759
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:18,480
the iterative correction.

2760
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:21,390
It's possible if you get really good at that,

2761
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:24,360
that you're outperforming the people that run from scratch,

2762
01:53:24,360 --> 01:53:27,870
that you can come up with truly innovative things,

2763
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:30,480
especially at this moment in history.

2764
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:33,510
While the LLMs are a little bit too dumb

2765
01:53:33,510 --> 01:53:36,630
to create super novel things and a complete product,

2766
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:38,317
but they're starting to creep close to that.

2767
01:53:38,317 --> 01:53:40,560
So if you are investing time now

2768
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,350
into becoming a really good vibe coder,

2769
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:46,120
maybe this is the right thing to do

2770
01:53:46,980 --> 01:53:48,630
as if it's indeed a skill,

2771
01:53:48,630 --> 01:53:50,430
we kind of meme about vibe coding,

2772
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:53,460
just like sitting back and it's in the name.

2773
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:55,110
But if you treat it seriously,

2774
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:57,210
a competitive vibe coder

2775
01:53:57,210 --> 01:54:00,000
and get good at riding the wave of AI

2776
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,470
and get good at the skill of editing code

2777
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:08,160
versus writing code from scratch, it's possible

2778
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:12,150
that you can actually get farther in the long term.

2779
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:14,668
Maybe editing is a fundamentally different task

2780
01:54:14,668 --> 01:54:16,770
than writing from scratch

2781
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:19,102
if you take that seriously as a skill that you develop.

2782
01:54:19,102 --> 01:54:21,867
To me that's an open question.

2783
01:54:21,867 --> 01:54:26,370
I just think, I personally, now you're on another level,

2784
01:54:26,370 --> 01:54:28,413
but just me, just personally,

2785
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:34,430
I'm not as good at editing the code that I didn't write.

2786
01:54:35,422 --> 01:54:36,957
- No one is. - That's one different.

2787
01:54:36,957 --> 01:54:39,213
- No one is of this generation,

2788
01:54:40,110 --> 01:54:42,840
but maybe that's a skill.

2789
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,107
Maybe if you get on the same page as the AI,

2790
01:54:45,107 --> 01:54:47,280
'cause there's a consistency to the AI.

2791
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,490
It's like it really is a pair programmer

2792
01:54:50,490 --> 01:54:53,520
with a consistent style and structure and so on.

2793
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:55,140
Plus with your own prompting,

2794
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:56,753
you can control the kind of wrote code you write.

2795
01:54:56,753 --> 01:54:59,190
I mean, it could generally be a skill like.

2796
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:01,560
- That's the dream of the prompt engineer.

2797
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,570
I think it's complete pipe dream.

2798
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:07,110
I don't think editors exist

2799
01:55:07,110 --> 01:55:08,910
that aren't good at writing.

2800
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:10,020
I've written a number of books.

2801
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:12,646
I've had a number of professional editors.

2802
01:55:12,646 --> 01:55:15,510
Not all of them wrote their own great books,

2803
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:17,700
but all of them were great writers in some regard.

2804
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:19,590
You cannot give someone pointers

2805
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:21,630
if you don't know how to do it.

2806
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:25,350
It's very difficult for an editor

2807
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:27,600
to be able to spot what's wrong with a problem

2808
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:31,140
if you that it couldn't make the solution themselves.

2809
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:34,230
Editing, in my opinion, is the reward,

2810
01:55:34,230 --> 01:55:36,420
the capacity to be a good editor

2811
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:39,090
is the reward you get from being a good doer.

2812
01:55:39,090 --> 01:55:40,680
You have to be a doer first.

2813
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:45,680
Now that's not the same as saying that vibe coding,

2814
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:48,540
prompt engineering won't be able to produce

2815
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:51,930
fully formed amazing systems even shortly.

2816
01:55:51,930 --> 01:55:53,670
I think that's entirely possible,

2817
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:55,230
but then there's no skill left,

2818
01:55:55,230 --> 01:55:57,570
which maybe is the greatest payoff at all.

2819
01:55:57,570 --> 01:55:59,850
Wasn't that the whole promise of AI anyway,

2820
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:01,650
that it was just all natural language

2821
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:04,451
that even my clumsy way of formulating a question

2822
01:56:04,451 --> 01:56:07,920
could result in a beautiful, succinct answer.

2823
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,470
That actually to me is a much more appealing vision

2824
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:11,730
that there's gonna be these special

2825
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:13,110
prompt engineering wizards

2826
01:56:13,110 --> 01:56:15,240
who know how to tickle the AI

2827
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:17,400
just write to produce what they want.

2828
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:20,400
The beauty of AI is to think that someone

2829
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,140
who doesn't know the first thing about

2830
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:25,856
how AI actually works is able to formulate their idea

2831
01:56:25,856 --> 01:56:28,620
and their aspirations for what they want,

2832
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:32,940
and the AI could somehow take that messy clump of ideas

2833
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:35,275
and produce something that someone wants.

2834
01:56:35,275 --> 01:56:37,920
That's actually what programming has always been.

2835
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,840
There's very often been people

2836
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,330
who didn't know how to program, who wanted programs,

2837
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:43,830
who then hired programmers,

2838
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:46,440
who gave them messy descriptions of what they wanted

2839
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:49,297
and then when the programmers delivered that back said,

2840
01:56:49,297 --> 01:56:50,730
"Oh no, actually that's not what I meant.

2841
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:52,710
I want something else."

2842
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:56,100
AI may be able to provide that cycle.

2843
01:56:56,100 --> 01:56:58,680
If that happens to the fullest extent of it,

2844
01:56:58,680 --> 01:56:59,513
yeah, there's not gonna be

2845
01:56:59,513 --> 01:57:01,110
as many programmers around, right?

2846
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:05,010
But hopefully presumably someone still,

2847
01:57:05,010 --> 01:57:06,510
at least for the foreseeable future,

2848
01:57:06,510 --> 01:57:08,880
have to understand whether what the AI is producing

2849
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:11,430
actually works or not.

2850
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:12,900
- As a interesting case study,

2851
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,400
maybe a thought experiment.

2852
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:19,400
If I wanted to vibe code Basecamp or HEY,

2853
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:23,331
and some of the products you've built,

2854
01:57:23,331 --> 01:57:26,323
like what would be the bottleneck?

2855
01:57:26,323 --> 01:57:28,248
Where would I fail along the way?

2856
01:57:28,248 --> 01:57:31,980
- What I've seen when I've been trying to do this,

2857
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:34,200
trying to use vibe coding to build something real

2858
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,513
is you actually failed really early.

2859
01:57:36,513 --> 01:57:39,510
The vibe coding is able to build a veneer

2860
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:41,398
at the current present moment

2861
01:57:41,398 --> 01:57:43,860
of something that looks like it works, right?

2862
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:44,737
But it's flawed in all sorts of ways.

2863
01:57:44,737 --> 01:57:47,520
There are the obvious ways, the meme ways

2864
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:49,692
that it's leaking all your API keys,

2865
01:57:49,692 --> 01:57:52,650
it's storing your password in plain text.

2866
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:54,840
I think that's ultimately solvable.

2867
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:56,130
Like it's gonna figure that out

2868
01:57:56,130 --> 01:57:58,170
or at least it's gonna get better at that,

2869
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,530
but its capacity to get lost in its own labyrinth

2870
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:03,095
is very great right now.

2871
01:58:03,095 --> 01:58:07,080
It code something and then you wanna change something

2872
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,460
and it becomes a game of whack-a-mole.

2873
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:11,160
Real quick, Pieter Levels who've been doing this wonderful

2874
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,840
flight simulator was talking to that

2875
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:14,760
where at a certain scale,

2876
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,770
the thing just keeps biting its own tail.

2877
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:17,730
You wanna fix something

2878
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:20,066
and it breaks five other things,

2879
01:58:20,066 --> 01:58:21,150
which I think is actually uniquely human

2880
01:58:21,150 --> 01:58:23,310
because that's how most bad programmers are.

2881
01:58:23,310 --> 01:58:25,797
At the certain level of complexity with the domain,

2882
01:58:25,797 --> 01:58:27,900
they can't fix one thing

2883
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:30,360
without breaking three other things.

2884
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:32,790
So in that way I'm actually

2885
01:58:32,790 --> 01:58:34,830
in some way it's almost a positive signal

2886
01:58:34,830 --> 01:58:36,210
for that the AI is gonna figure this out

2887
01:58:36,210 --> 01:58:39,570
because it's done an extremely human trajectory right now.

2888
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:41,130
The kind of mistakes it's making

2889
01:58:41,130 --> 01:58:42,780
are the kind of mistakes the junior programmers

2890
01:58:42,780 --> 01:58:43,620
make all the time.

2891
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:48,620
- Yeah, can we zoom out and look at the vision,

2892
01:58:48,654 --> 01:58:51,480
the manifesto, the doctrine of Rails?

2893
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,950
What are some of the things

2894
01:58:52,950 --> 01:58:57,270
that make a programming language a framework great?

2895
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:58,590
Especially for web development.

2896
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:00,091
So we talked about happiness.

2897
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:03,367
The underlying objective of Ruby.

2898
01:59:03,367 --> 01:59:04,830
What else?

2899
01:59:04,830 --> 01:59:06,793
- So you're looking at the nine points I wrote out

2900
01:59:06,793 --> 01:59:08,670
in I think 2012.

2901
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:10,170
And first, before we dive into 'em,

2902
01:59:10,170 --> 01:59:12,540
I wanna say the reason I wrote it down

2903
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:17,520
is that if you want a community to endure,

2904
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:19,470
you have to record its values

2905
01:59:19,470 --> 01:59:21,150
and you have to record its practices.

2906
01:59:21,150 --> 01:59:23,940
If you don't, eventually you're gonna get enough

2907
01:59:23,940 --> 01:59:26,520
new people come in who have their own ideas

2908
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:27,870
of where this thing should go.

2909
01:59:27,870 --> 01:59:31,050
And if we don't have a a guiding light

2910
01:59:31,050 --> 01:59:34,680
helping us to make decisions, we're gonna start flailing.

2911
01:59:34,680 --> 01:59:36,180
We're gonna start actually falling apart.

2912
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:37,650
I think this is one of the key reasons

2913
01:59:37,650 --> 01:59:40,680
that institutions of all kinds start falling apart.

2914
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:43,940
We forget why Chesterton's Fence is there.

2915
01:59:43,940 --> 01:59:45,540
We just go like, why is that fence there?

2916
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:46,650
Let's yank it out.

2917
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:48,330
Oh, it was to keep the wolves out.

2918
01:59:48,330 --> 01:59:50,760
Now we're all dead, oops.

2919
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:52,980
So I wanted to write these things down.

2920
01:59:52,980 --> 01:59:54,900
And if we just take them quick one by one,

2921
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,030
you talked about optimizing for programmer happiness.

2922
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:59,959
I put that at number one in homage of Matz,

2923
01:59:59,959 --> 02:00:02,190
and that's a lot about accepting

2924
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:04,170
that there is occasionally a trade off

2925
02:00:04,170 --> 02:00:05,820
between writing beautiful code

2926
02:00:05,820 --> 02:00:07,350
and other things we want out of systems.

2927
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:09,030
There could be a runtime trade off,

2928
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:10,800
there can be a performance trade off,

2929
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,290
but we're gonna do it nonetheless.

2930
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:16,350
We're also going to allow ambiguity

2931
02:00:16,350 --> 02:00:18,840
in a way that many programmers, by default,

2932
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:20,820
are uncomfortable with.

2933
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:22,770
I give the example actually here

2934
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:25,899
of in the interactive Ruby shell

2935
02:00:25,899 --> 02:00:27,390
where you can play with the language

2936
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:29,340
or even interact with your domain model.

2937
02:00:29,340 --> 02:00:33,060
You can quit it in two ways, at least that I found.

2938
02:00:33,060 --> 02:00:34,560
You can write exit.

2939
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,910
Boom, you're out of the program.

2940
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:37,260
You can write quit.

2941
02:00:37,260 --> 02:00:38,280
Boom, you're out of the program.

2942
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:39,450
They do the same thing.

2943
02:00:39,450 --> 02:00:40,830
We just wrote both exit

2944
02:00:40,830 --> 02:00:42,990
or the people who built that wrote both exit and quit

2945
02:00:42,990 --> 02:00:44,610
because they knew humans were likely

2946
02:00:44,610 --> 02:00:45,600
to pick one or the other.

2947
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:49,260
Python is the perfect contrast to this.

2948
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:51,630
In the Python interactive protocol,

2949
02:00:51,630 --> 02:00:53,591
if you write exit, it won't exit.

2950
02:00:53,591 --> 02:00:55,314
It'll give you a lesson.

2951
02:00:55,314 --> 02:00:58,200
It'll basically tell you to read the fucking manual.

2952
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:01,830
It says use exit parentheses

2953
02:01:01,830 --> 02:01:06,300
or Ctrl-D i.e. end of file to exit.

2954
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:11,300
I'm like, one is very human and another is very engineer.

2955
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:15,330
And I mean that both of them in the best possible way.

2956
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:16,594
Python is pedantic.

2957
02:01:16,594 --> 02:01:21,420
Python is the value from the start stated

2958
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:23,550
is that there should be preferably one

2959
02:01:23,550 --> 02:01:26,520
and only one way to do a certain thing.

2960
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,110
Ruby is the complete opposite.

2961
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:29,970
No, we want the full expression

2962
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:33,000
that fits different human brains,

2963
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,700
such that it seems like the language

2964
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:37,800
is guessing just what they want.

2965
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,600
- And part of that is also described

2966
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:41,430
the principle of least surprise,

2967
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:44,670
which is a difficult thing to engineer into a language

2968
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:46,860
because you have to kind of, it's a subjective thing.

2969
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:48,450
- Which is why you can't do it in one way,

2970
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:50,940
which is why I used the example of both exit and quit.

2971
02:01:50,940 --> 02:01:52,860
The principle of least surprise

2972
02:01:52,860 --> 02:01:54,780
for some people would be like, "Oh, exit.

2973
02:01:54,780 --> 02:01:57,090
That's how I get out of the prompt."

2974
02:01:57,090 --> 02:01:58,470
For other people it'd be quit.

2975
02:01:58,470 --> 02:02:00,788
Why don't we just do both?

2976
02:02:00,788 --> 02:02:04,141
- Okay, so what's the convention over configuration?

2977
02:02:04,141 --> 02:02:05,225
That's a big one.

2978
02:02:05,225 --> 02:02:06,058
- That's a big one.

2979
02:02:06,058 --> 02:02:06,891
That's a huge one.

2980
02:02:06,891 --> 02:02:09,480
And it was born out of a frustration

2981
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:12,360
I had in the early days with especially Java frameworks

2982
02:02:12,360 --> 02:02:14,670
where when you were setting up a web application framework

2983
02:02:14,670 --> 02:02:15,960
for Java back in the day,

2984
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:17,970
it was not uncommon to literally

2985
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:20,940
write hundreds if not thousands of lines

2986
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:23,010
of XML configuration files.

2987
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:23,970
Oh, I need this.

2988
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:27,840
I want the database to use the foreign keys

2989
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,820
as post_id.

2990
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:33,780
No, no, no, I wanted as post capital ID.

2991
02:02:33,780 --> 02:02:36,363
Oh, no, no, no, you have to do it capital PID.

2992
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:38,610
There are all these ways

2993
02:02:38,610 --> 02:02:40,845
where you can configure how foreign relation keys

2994
02:02:40,845 --> 02:02:43,741
should work in a database and none of them matter.

2995
02:02:43,741 --> 02:02:46,650
We just need to pick one, and then that's fine.

2996
02:02:46,650 --> 02:02:49,410
And if we pick one and we can depend on it,

2997
02:02:49,410 --> 02:02:50,730
it becomes a convention.

2998
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:52,797
And if it's a convention, we don't have to configure it.

2999
02:02:52,797 --> 02:02:53,843
And if we don't have to configure it,

3000
02:02:53,843 --> 02:02:56,010
you can get started with you actually care

3001
02:02:56,010 --> 02:02:57,750
about much quicker.

3002
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:59,100
So convention over configuration

3003
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:01,590
is essentially to take that idea

3004
02:03:01,590 --> 02:03:04,320
that the system should come preassembled.

3005
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:06,840
I'm not just handing you a box of fucking Legos

3006
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:08,910
and asking you to build the Millennium Falcon.

3007
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:10,530
I'm giving you a finished toy.

3008
02:03:10,530 --> 02:03:11,760
You can edit, you can change it,

3009
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,020
it's still build out a Legos.

3010
02:03:13,020 --> 02:03:14,430
You can still take some pieces off

3011
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:15,510
and put in some other pieces,

3012
02:03:15,510 --> 02:03:17,040
but I'm giving you the final product.

3013
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:19,200
And this cuts against the grain

3014
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:21,030
of what most programmers love.

3015
02:03:21,030 --> 02:03:22,470
They love a box of Legos.

3016
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:24,690
They love to put everything together from scratch.

3017
02:03:24,690 --> 02:03:26,749
They love to make all these detailed little decisions

3018
02:03:26,749 --> 02:03:28,590
that just don't matter at all.

3019
02:03:28,590 --> 02:03:29,753
And I want to elevate that up

3020
02:03:29,753 --> 02:03:32,070
so that hey, I'm not trying to take the decisions

3021
02:03:32,070 --> 02:03:32,903
away from you.

3022
02:03:32,903 --> 02:03:34,560
I just want you to focus on decisions

3023
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:37,440
that actually matter that you truly care about.

3024
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:40,080
No one cares about whether it's post_id

3025
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:41,595
or post ID or PID.

3026
02:03:41,595 --> 02:03:43,507
- Yeah, great defaults. - Yes.

3027
02:03:43,507 --> 02:03:45,540
- It's just a wonderful thing.

3028
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:46,890
You have all these aspirations,

3029
02:03:46,890 --> 02:03:48,540
they're gonna do some kind of custom,

3030
02:03:48,540 --> 02:03:50,940
most beautiful Legos castle

3031
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:52,710
that nobody's ever built from these pieces.

3032
02:03:52,710 --> 02:03:56,550
But in reality to be productive in most situations,

3033
02:03:56,550 --> 02:04:00,000
you just need to build the basic thing.

3034
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,300
And then on top of that is where your creativity comes.

3035
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:05,899
- Absolutely, and I think this is one of those,

3036
02:04:05,899 --> 02:04:08,940
part of the doctrine that a lot of programmers

3037
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:11,415
who get to use Ruby on Rails

3038
02:04:11,415 --> 02:04:14,580
begrudgingly will acknowledge it's a nice thing,

3039
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,500
even if they don't really like it.

3040
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:21,030
Like it's hard to beat the sort of attraction

3041
02:04:21,030 --> 02:04:23,610
to building with Legos from scratch out of programmers.

3042
02:04:23,610 --> 02:04:24,630
That's just what we like.

3043
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:26,160
This is why we're programmers in the first place

3044
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:28,260
because we'd like to put these little pieces together,

3045
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:30,270
but we can direct that instinct

3046
02:04:30,270 --> 02:04:33,567
towards a more productive end of the stack.

3047
02:04:33,567 --> 02:04:35,752
- Okay, what are some of the other ones?

3048
02:04:35,752 --> 02:04:37,650
- The menu is omakase.

3049
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:39,420
It actually comes out of the same principle

3050
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:41,940
that great defaults really matter.

3051
02:04:41,940 --> 02:04:43,080
If you look at everything

3052
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:45,330
that's wrong with the JavaScript ecosystem right now,

3053
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:49,380
for example, it is that no one is in charge of the menu.

3054
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:51,390
There are a billion different dishes

3055
02:04:51,390 --> 02:04:54,900
and you can configure just your tailored specific

3056
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,370
configuration of it,

3057
02:04:56,370 --> 02:04:59,280
but no one done the work to make sure it all fits together.

3058
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:00,990
So you have all these unique problems

3059
02:05:00,990 --> 02:05:02,670
in the JavaScript ecosystem, for example,

3060
02:05:02,670 --> 02:05:05,720
there's probably 25 major ways

3061
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:07,950
of just doing the controller layer.

3062
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:10,830
And then as many of how to talk to the database.

3063
02:05:10,830 --> 02:05:14,177
So you get this permutation of n times n times n

3064
02:05:14,177 --> 02:05:16,797
of no one is using the same thing.

3065
02:05:16,797 --> 02:05:18,330
And if they are using the same thing,

3066
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:20,160
they're only using the same thing for about five minutes.

3067
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:23,070
So we have no retained wisdom.

3068
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:25,477
We build up no durable skills.

3069
02:05:25,477 --> 02:05:28,132
Rails goes the complete opposite way of saying,

3070
02:05:28,132 --> 02:05:28,965
do you know what?

3071
02:05:28,965 --> 02:05:32,040
Rails is not just a white framework.

3072
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:36,150
It's a complete attempt at solving the web problem.

3073
02:05:36,150 --> 02:05:38,670
It's a complete attempt at solving everything you need

3074
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:40,830
to build a great web application.

3075
02:05:40,830 --> 02:05:43,590
And every piece of that puzzle

3076
02:05:43,590 --> 02:05:46,110
should ideally be in the box

3077
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:48,360
pre-configured, preassembled.

3078
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,160
If you want to change some of those pieces later,

3079
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:51,060
that's wonderful.

3080
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:54,720
But on day one you'll get a full menu

3081
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:56,670
designed by a chef who really cared

3082
02:05:56,670 --> 02:06:00,303
about every piece of ingredient and you're gonna enjoy it.

3083
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:03,990
And that's again, one of those things

3084
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:07,530
where many programmers think like I know better.

3085
02:06:07,530 --> 02:06:10,740
And they do in some hyper local sense of it.

3086
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:12,270
Every programmer knows better.

3087
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:13,770
This is what Ruby is built on.

3088
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:15,720
That every programmer knows better

3089
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:16,980
in their specific situation.

3090
02:06:16,980 --> 02:06:19,540
Maybe they can do something dangerous.

3091
02:06:19,540 --> 02:06:20,430
Maybe they think they know better

3092
02:06:20,430 --> 02:06:21,840
and then they blow their foot off

3093
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,580
and then they truly will know better

3094
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:24,960
because they've blown their foot off once

3095
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,340
and won't do it again.

3096
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:28,580
But the the menu of omakase is that.

3097
02:06:28,580 --> 02:06:30,930
- So you in general

3098
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:32,940
see the value in the in the monolith?

3099
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:34,920
- Yes, the integrated system.

3100
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,450
- Integrated. - That someone thought

3101
02:06:36,450 --> 02:06:37,440
of the whole problem.

3102
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:40,620
This is one of the reasons why I've been on a crusade

3103
02:06:40,620 --> 02:06:43,800
against microservices since the term was coined.

3104
02:06:43,800 --> 02:06:47,610
Microservices was born out of essentially a good idea.

3105
02:06:47,610 --> 02:06:49,860
What do you do at Netflix scale

3106
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:51,870
when you have thousands of engineers working

3107
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:53,610
on millions of lines of code?

3108
02:06:53,610 --> 02:06:55,170
No one can keep that entire system

3109
02:06:55,170 --> 02:06:57,060
in their head at one time. You have to break it down.

3110
02:06:57,060 --> 02:06:59,370
Microservices can be a reasonable way to do that.

3111
02:06:59,370 --> 02:07:01,232
When you're at Netflix scale,

3112
02:07:01,232 --> 02:07:04,920
when you apply that pattern to a team of 20 programmers

3113
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:07,560
working on a code base of half a million lines of code,

3114
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:08,741
you're an idiot.

3115
02:07:08,741 --> 02:07:13,170
You just don't need to turn method invocations

3116
02:07:13,170 --> 02:07:14,640
into network calls.

3117
02:07:14,640 --> 02:07:17,520
It is the first rule of distributed programming.

3118
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:20,220
Do not distribute your programming.

3119
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:22,050
It is makes everything harder.

3120
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:23,670
All the failure conditions

3121
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:25,140
you have to consider as a programmer

3122
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:26,610
just becomes infinitely harder

3123
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:28,440
when there's a network cable involved.

3124
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:33,104
So I hate the idea of premature decomposition

3125
02:07:33,104 --> 02:07:35,220
and microservices is exactly that.

3126
02:07:35,220 --> 02:07:36,810
The monolith says.

3127
02:07:36,810 --> 02:07:39,240
Let's try to focus on building a whole system

3128
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:41,340
that a single human can actually understand

3129
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:44,760
and push that paradigm as far as possible

3130
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,496
by compressing all the concepts

3131
02:07:46,496 --> 02:07:48,270
such that more of it will fit into memory

3132
02:07:48,270 --> 02:07:50,280
of a single operating human.

3133
02:07:50,280 --> 02:07:51,780
And then we can have a system

3134
02:07:51,780 --> 02:07:53,850
where I can actually understand all the Basecamp.

3135
02:07:53,850 --> 02:07:55,860
I can actually understand all of HEY.

3136
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:56,730
Both of those systems

3137
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:59,010
are just over a hundred thousand lines of code.

3138
02:07:59,010 --> 02:08:00,468
I've seen people do this that maybe twice,

3139
02:08:00,468 --> 02:08:01,980
maybe three times that scale

3140
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:03,060
and then it starts breaking down.

3141
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:04,560
Once you get north of certainly

3142
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:06,480
half a million lines of code,

3143
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:07,920
no individual human can do it

3144
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,200
and that's when you get into maybe some degree

3145
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:12,030
of microservices can make sense.

3146
02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:13,627
- Basecamp and HEY are both a hundred thousand?

3147
02:08:13,627 --> 02:08:15,390
- A hundred thousand lines of code thereabouts.

3148
02:08:15,390 --> 02:08:16,370
- Wow, it's small.

3149
02:08:16,370 --> 02:08:17,490
- It is.

3150
02:08:17,490 --> 02:08:18,793
Considering the fact that Basecamp

3151
02:08:18,793 --> 02:08:21,540
I think has something like 420 screens,

3152
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:23,400
different ways and configurations.

3153
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:25,398
- Ah, do you include the front end in that?

3154
02:08:25,398 --> 02:08:26,910
- No, that's the Ruby code.

3155
02:08:26,910 --> 02:08:28,290
Well, it's front end in the sense

3156
02:08:28,290 --> 02:08:29,280
that some of that Ruby codes.

3157
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:30,870
It's beneficial to the front,

3158
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:32,640
but it's not JavaScript for example.

3159
02:08:32,640 --> 02:08:34,370
Now the other thing we might talk about later

3160
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:36,600
is we write very little JavaScript actually

3161
02:08:36,600 --> 02:08:38,130
for all of our applications.

3162
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:40,260
HEY, which is a Gmail competitor.

3163
02:08:40,260 --> 02:08:43,260
Gmail ships I think 28 megabytes

3164
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:44,640
of uncompressed JavaScript.

3165
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:45,473
If you compress it,

3166
02:08:45,473 --> 02:08:47,310
I think it's about six megabytes, 28 megabytes.

3167
02:08:47,310 --> 02:08:48,840
Think about how many lines of code that is.

3168
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:53,089
When HEY launched, we shipped 40 kilobytes.

3169
02:08:53,089 --> 02:08:55,200
It's trying to solve the same problem.

3170
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:58,230
You can solve the email client problem

3171
02:08:58,230 --> 02:09:00,900
with either 28 megabytes of uncompressed JavaScript

3172
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:03,826
or with 40 kilobytes if you do things differently.

3173
02:09:03,826 --> 02:09:06,557
But that comes through the same problem essentially.

3174
02:09:06,557 --> 02:09:10,200
This is why I have fiercely fought

3175
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,720
splitting front end and back end apart.

3176
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,750
That, in my opinion, this was one of the great crimes

3177
02:09:15,750 --> 02:09:16,710
against web development.

3178
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:20,310
That we are still atoning for.

3179
02:09:20,310 --> 02:09:22,456
That we separated and divided

3180
02:09:22,456 --> 02:09:27,456
what was and should be a unified problem solving mechanism.

3181
02:09:27,900 --> 02:09:30,060
When you are working both on front end and back end,

3182
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:31,830
you understand the whole system.

3183
02:09:31,830 --> 02:09:34,050
And you're not going to get into these camps

3184
02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:37,030
that decompose and eventually you end up with like GraphQL.

3185
02:09:38,556 --> 02:09:43,140
- Okay, let's fly through the rest of the doctrine.

3186
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:44,700
No one paradigm.

3187
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:46,680
- No one paradigm goes to the fact that Ruby

3188
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:48,960
is a fiercely object-oriented programming language

3189
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:52,103
at its core, but it's also a functional program language.

3190
02:09:52,103 --> 02:09:55,140
This five times I told you about,

3191
02:09:55,140 --> 02:09:58,950
you can essentially do these anonymous function calls

3192
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:01,770
and you can chain 'em together very much in the spirit

3193
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:04,380
of how true functional programming languages worked.

3194
02:10:04,380 --> 02:10:05,880
Ruby has even moved closer

3195
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:06,947
towards the functional programming

3196
02:10:06,947 --> 02:10:10,383
and of the scale by making strings immutable.

3197
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:14,910
There are ideas from all different disciplines

3198
02:10:14,910 --> 02:10:16,440
and all different paradigms

3199
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:18,797
of software development that can fit together.

3200
02:10:18,797 --> 02:10:19,983
Smalltalk, for example.

3201
02:10:19,983 --> 02:10:22,080
With only object oriented,

3202
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,913
and that was just it.

3203
02:10:22,913 --> 02:10:25,410
Ruby tries to be mainly object oriented,

3204
02:10:25,410 --> 02:10:27,630
but borrow a little bit of functional programming,

3205
02:10:27,630 --> 02:10:28,890
a little bit of imperative programming,

3206
02:10:28,890 --> 02:10:30,480
be able to do all of that.

3207
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:32,160
Rails tries to do the same thing.

3208
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:34,200
We're not just gonna pick one paradigm

3209
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:35,670
and run it through everything.

3210
02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:38,250
Object orientation is at the center of it,

3211
02:10:38,250 --> 02:10:40,770
but it's okay to invite all these other disciplines

3212
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:42,060
and it's okay to be inspired.

3213
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:43,650
It's okay to remix it.

3214
02:10:43,650 --> 02:10:47,520
I actually think one of the main benefits of Rails

3215
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:48,900
is that it's a remix.

3216
02:10:48,900 --> 02:10:50,820
I didn't invent all these ideas.

3217
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:52,470
I didn't come up with active record.

3218
02:10:52,470 --> 02:10:54,330
I didn't come up with the NBC

3219
02:10:54,330 --> 02:10:56,010
way of dividing an application.

3220
02:10:56,010 --> 02:10:57,660
I took all the great ideas

3221
02:10:57,660 --> 02:11:01,290
that I had learned and picked up from every different camp

3222
02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:02,370
and I put it together.

3223
02:11:02,370 --> 02:11:04,590
Not because there was gonna be just one single

3224
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:06,242
overarching theory of everything,

3225
02:11:06,242 --> 02:11:08,460
but I was gonna have a cohesive unit

3226
02:11:08,460 --> 02:11:10,020
that incorporated the best from everywhere.

3227
02:11:10,020 --> 02:11:12,107
- Is that idea a bit at tension

3228
02:11:12,107 --> 02:11:14,992
with the beauty of the monolith system?

3229
02:11:14,992 --> 02:11:19,992
- I think the monolith can be thought of as quite roomy,

3230
02:11:20,670 --> 02:11:24,930
quite as a big tent that the monolith needs actually

3231
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:27,090
to borrow a little bit of functional programming

3232
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:29,730
for the kinds of problems that that excels,

3233
02:11:29,730 --> 02:11:31,230
that discipline excels at solving,

3234
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:33,177
and that paradigm excels at solving.

3235
02:11:33,177 --> 02:11:36,270
If you also want object orientation at its core.

3236
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:37,290
I actually think when I've looked

3237
02:11:37,290 --> 02:11:39,090
at functional programming languages,

3238
02:11:39,090 --> 02:11:40,380
there's a lot to love.

3239
02:11:40,380 --> 02:11:44,070
And then I see some of the crazy contortions

3240
02:11:44,070 --> 02:11:45,210
they have to go through

3241
02:11:45,210 --> 02:11:47,370
when part of the problem they're solving calls

3242
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:49,350
for mutating something.

3243
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:52,313
And you go like, holy shit,

3244
02:11:52,313 --> 02:11:56,130
this is a great paradigm from 90% of the problem.

3245
02:11:56,130 --> 02:11:58,560
And then you're twisting yourself completely out of shape

3246
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,300
when you try to solve the last 10.

3247
02:12:00,300 --> 02:12:03,060
- Ooh, exalt beautiful code is in the next one.

3248
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:04,230
- We've talked about that at length

3249
02:12:04,230 --> 02:12:06,269
and here's a great example that really summarizes

3250
02:12:06,269 --> 02:12:10,800
the domain specific language quality of Ruby on Rails

3251
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:15,800
that you can make code actually pleasant to write and read.

3252
02:12:16,140 --> 02:12:17,310
Which is really funny to me

3253
02:12:17,310 --> 02:12:18,630
because as we talked about

3254
02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:20,130
when I started learning programming,

3255
02:12:20,130 --> 02:12:21,480
it wasn't even a consideration.

3256
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:23,880
I didn't even know that that could be part of the premise,

3257
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:26,220
that could be part of the solution.

3258
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:31,220
That writing code could feel as good as writing a poem.

3259
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,590
- class Project, ApplicationRecord

3260
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:36,810
belongs_to :account has many participants.

3261
02:12:36,810 --> 02:12:41,190
Class_name, Person, validates_presence_of :name.

3262
02:12:41,190 --> 02:12:42,990
- See, you could read it out.

3263
02:12:42,990 --> 02:12:44,010
You didn't even change.

3264
02:12:44,010 --> 02:12:45,570
- Anything like a haiku or something.

3265
02:12:45,570 --> 02:12:47,310
- Right? Isn't that beautiful?

3266
02:12:47,310 --> 02:12:48,567
- Yeah, it's nice.

3267
02:12:48,567 --> 02:12:50,040
It's really nice.

3268
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:52,050
There's an intuitive nature to it.

3269
02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:54,810
Okay, so I have specific questions there.

3270
02:12:54,810 --> 02:12:57,960
I mean ActiveRecord, just to take that tangent.

3271
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:00,420
That has to be your favorite feature.

3272
02:13:00,420 --> 02:13:02,850
- It's the crown jewel of Rails.

3273
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:04,131
It really is.

3274
02:13:04,131 --> 02:13:05,730
It is the defining characteristic

3275
02:13:05,730 --> 02:13:07,747
of how to work with Ruby on Rails.

3276
02:13:07,747 --> 02:13:12,450
And it's born in an interesting level of controversy,

3277
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:14,280
because it actually uses a pattern

3278
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:16,020
that had been described by Martin Fowler

3279
02:13:16,020 --> 02:13:18,780
in the "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture."

3280
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:21,510
One of the greatest books

3281
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:23,670
for anyone working on business systems.

3282
02:13:23,670 --> 02:13:26,137
And if you had not read it, you must pick it up immediately.

3283
02:13:26,137 --> 02:13:28,740
"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture,"

3284
02:13:28,740 --> 02:13:30,780
I think it was published in 2001.

3285
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:33,510
It is one of the very few programming books

3286
02:13:33,510 --> 02:13:35,370
that I have read many times over.

3287
02:13:35,370 --> 02:13:36,630
It's incredible.

3288
02:13:36,630 --> 02:13:41,010
In it, Martin describes a bunch of different patterns

3289
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:42,507
of how to build business systems essentially.

3290
02:13:42,507 --> 02:13:45,720
And ActiveRecord is a little bit of a footnote in there.

3291
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:47,340
The pattern is literally called active record.

3292
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:48,173
You can look it up. - Nice.

3293
02:13:48,173 --> 02:13:49,050
- It's called active record.

3294
02:13:49,050 --> 02:13:50,670
I wasn't even creative enough

3295
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:52,770
to come up with a name of my own.

3296
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:55,800
But it allows the creation,

3297
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:58,650
the marriage of database and object orientation

3298
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:00,420
in a way that a lot of programmers

3299
02:14:00,420 --> 02:14:03,990
find a little off-putting.

3300
02:14:03,990 --> 02:14:05,825
They don't actually want to pollute

3301
02:14:05,825 --> 02:14:08,761
the beautiful object-oriented nature

3302
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:12,061
of that kind of programming with SQL.

3303
02:14:12,061 --> 02:14:15,030
There was a rant by Uncle Bob the other day about

3304
02:14:15,030 --> 02:14:16,920
how SQL is the worst thing ever.

3305
02:14:16,920 --> 02:14:20,063
Baba, okay fine, whatever, I don't care.

3306
02:14:20,063 --> 02:14:22,145
This is practical.

3307
02:14:22,145 --> 02:14:24,960
We are making CRUD applications.

3308
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:26,820
You're taking things out of an HTML form

3309
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:28,680
and you're sticking 'em into a damn database.

3310
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:30,270
It's not more complicated than that.

3311
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:31,830
The more abstractions you put in

3312
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:34,268
between those two ends of the spectrum,

3313
02:14:34,268 --> 02:14:36,360
the more you're just fooling yourself.

3314
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:37,230
This is what we're doing.

3315
02:14:37,230 --> 02:14:39,270
We're talking to SQL databases.

3316
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:42,420
By the way, quick aside, SQL was one of those things

3317
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:44,370
that have endured the onslaught

3318
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:47,820
of NoSQL databases structured list data

3319
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:49,230
for a better part of a decade

3320
02:14:49,230 --> 02:14:50,880
and still reign supreme.

3321
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:53,640
SQL was a good thing to invest your time in learning.

3322
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:55,560
Every program I'm working with the web

3323
02:14:55,560 --> 02:14:58,320
should know SQL to a fair degree.

3324
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,360
Even if they're working with an ORM,

3325
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:02,640
an optic relational map or as active record.

3326
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:04,770
You still need to understand SQL.

3327
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:06,000
What Active record does

3328
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,030
is not so much try to abstract the SQL away

3329
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:10,530
behind a different kind of paradigm.

3330
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:12,900
It's just making it less cumbersome to write.

3331
02:15:12,900 --> 02:15:16,260
Making it more amenable to build

3332
02:15:16,260 --> 02:15:20,130
domain models on top of other domain models

3333
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:21,163
in a ways that you don't have to write

3334
02:15:21,163 --> 02:15:22,968
every damn SQL statement by hand.

3335
02:15:22,968 --> 02:15:26,120
- We'll just say the active record is an ORM,

3336
02:15:26,120 --> 02:15:30,150
which is a layer that makes it intuitive

3337
02:15:30,150 --> 02:15:33,600
and human interpretable to communicate with a database.

3338
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:34,890
- Even simpler than that.

3339
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:39,890
It turns tables into classes and rows into objects.

3340
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:42,780
I actually think SQL is very easy to understand most of it.

3341
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:44,280
You can write some SQL golf too.

3342
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,750
That's very hard to understand.

3343
02:15:45,750 --> 02:15:47,280
But SQL at its base,

3344
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:48,810
and much of the criticism against SQL

3345
02:15:48,810 --> 02:15:51,210
was it was written for human consumption.

3346
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:52,980
It's actually quite verbose,

3347
02:15:52,980 --> 02:15:54,090
especially if you're doing things

3348
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:55,680
like inserts over and over again.

3349
02:15:55,680 --> 02:15:59,280
It's quite verbose insert into table parentheses,

3350
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:02,850
enumerate every column you want to insert, values,

3351
02:16:02,850 --> 02:16:05,485
parentheses, every value that fits with that column.

3352
02:16:05,485 --> 02:16:09,000
It gets tedious to write SQL by hand,

3353
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
but it's actually very humanly readable.

3354
02:16:11,870 --> 02:16:15,510
Active record just takes that tedious away.

3355
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:17,700
It makes it possible to combine things in a way

3356
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:21,030
that a humanly describable language just doesn't.

3357
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:22,710
It composes things into methods

3358
02:16:22,710 --> 02:16:24,903
and you can combine these methods

3359
02:16:24,903 --> 02:16:25,740
and you can build structures around them.

3360
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:27,840
So I don't dislike SQL,

3361
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,310
I dislike a lot of things in programming.

3362
02:16:29,310 --> 02:16:30,540
I try to get rid of them.

3363
02:16:30,540 --> 02:16:32,250
SQL wasn't really one of them.

3364
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:34,709
It was just a sense of I don't wanna write

3365
02:16:34,709 --> 02:16:35,700
the same thing over and over again.

3366
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:38,250
It was a, can we be a little more succinct?

3367
02:16:38,250 --> 02:16:39,750
Can we match it just slightly better

3368
02:16:39,750 --> 02:16:41,879
to the optic orientation

3369
02:16:41,879 --> 02:16:44,580
without trying to hide away the fact

3370
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:47,730
that we're persisting these objects into a database.

3371
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:50,580
That's where I think a lot of ORMs went wrong.

3372
02:16:50,580 --> 02:16:54,510
They tried to live in the pure world of objects.

3373
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:56,190
Never to consider that those objects

3374
02:16:56,190 --> 02:16:58,200
had to be consistent into a SQL database

3375
02:16:58,200 --> 02:17:00,510
and then they came up with convoluted way

3376
02:17:00,510 --> 02:17:02,309
of translating back and forth.

3377
02:17:02,309 --> 02:17:04,290
Active record says, do you know what?

3378
02:17:04,290 --> 02:17:05,340
Just accept it.

3379
02:17:05,340 --> 02:17:08,160
This record, this object is not gonna get saved

3380
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:09,543
into some NoSQL database.

3381
02:17:09,543 --> 02:17:11,290
It's not gonna be saved.

3382
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:12,450
It's gonna be saved into SQL database.

3383
02:17:12,450 --> 02:17:14,760
So it's just structure the whole thing around that.

3384
02:17:14,760 --> 02:17:16,049
It's gonna have attributes.

3385
02:17:16,049 --> 02:17:17,700
Those attributes are gonna respond

3386
02:17:17,700 --> 02:17:19,112
to columns in the database.

3387
02:17:19,112 --> 02:17:21,728
It's not more complicated than that stuff making it so.

3388
02:17:21,728 --> 02:17:24,120
- Yeah, but I should say, so I personally love SQL

3389
02:17:24,120 --> 02:17:26,879
because I'm an algorithms person

3390
02:17:26,879 --> 02:17:28,620
and so I love optimization.

3391
02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:31,290
I love to know how the databases actually work

3392
02:17:31,290 --> 02:17:34,276
so I can match the SQL queries

3393
02:17:34,276 --> 02:17:39,276
and the design of the table such that there is, you know,

3394
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:42,629
optimal, squeeze the optimal performance out of the table.

3395
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:46,559
Okay, based on the actual way that that table is used.

3396
02:17:46,559 --> 02:17:48,780
So I mean, I think that pushes to the point

3397
02:17:48,780 --> 02:17:53,190
that like there is value in learning in understanding SQL.

3398
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:57,540
I wonder, because I started looking at active record

3399
02:17:57,540 --> 02:17:59,129
and it looks really awesome.

3400
02:17:59,129 --> 02:18:00,840
Does that make you lazy?

3401
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:03,690
Not you, but a person that rolls in

3402
02:18:03,690 --> 02:18:07,559
and starts using Rails you can probably get away

3403
02:18:07,559 --> 02:18:09,731
with never really learning SQL, right?

3404
02:18:09,731 --> 02:18:11,430
- As long as you wanna stay

3405
02:18:11,430 --> 02:18:13,138
at the entry level of competence.

3406
02:18:13,138 --> 02:18:16,590
And this is actually my overarching mission with Rails

3407
02:18:16,590 --> 02:18:19,874
is to lower the barrier of entry so far down

3408
02:18:19,874 --> 02:18:23,459
that someone can start seeing stuff

3409
02:18:23,459 --> 02:18:26,280
on their browser without basically understanding anything.

3410
02:18:26,280 --> 02:18:30,090
Yeah, they can run Rail's new blog,

3411
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:32,580
run a couple of generators, they have a whole system,

3412
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:34,379
they don't understand anything.

3413
02:18:34,379 --> 02:18:36,780
But it's an invitation to learn more.

3414
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:37,830
Where I get fired up,

3415
02:18:37,830 --> 02:18:40,170
and this ties back to the AI discussion,

3416
02:18:40,170 --> 02:18:42,959
is when that's turned into this meme,

3417
02:18:42,959 --> 02:18:45,309
that programmers no longer have to be competent.

3418
02:18:45,309 --> 02:18:47,520
I mean the AI is gonna figure it out.

3419
02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:49,200
The generators is gonna figure it out.

3420
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:50,549
I don't need to know SQL,

3421
02:18:50,549 --> 02:18:52,379
active record is gonna abstract it away from me.

3422
02:18:52,379 --> 02:18:54,799
No, no, no dude, hold up.

3423
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:56,856
The path here is competence.

3424
02:18:56,856 --> 02:18:58,650
I'm trying to teach you things.

3425
02:18:58,650 --> 02:19:01,350
I understand I can't teach you everything in five minutes.

3426
02:19:01,350 --> 02:19:04,740
No one who's ever become good at anything worthwhile

3427
02:19:04,740 --> 02:19:06,510
could be taught everything in five minutes.

3428
02:19:06,510 --> 02:19:07,709
If you wanna be a fully

3429
02:19:07,709 --> 02:19:10,620
well-rounded web application developer,

3430
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:12,180
that takes years.

3431
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:15,480
But you can actually become somewhat productive

3432
02:19:15,480 --> 02:19:18,240
in a few days. You can have fun in a few days for sure.

3433
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:20,969
You're gonna have fun in a a few minutes and a few hours.

3434
02:19:20,969 --> 02:19:23,219
And over time, I can teach you a little more.

3435
02:19:23,219 --> 02:19:24,930
Active record says like, yeah, yeah.

3436
02:19:24,930 --> 02:19:26,879
All right, start to here

3437
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:30,017
and then like next week we'll do a class on SQL.

3438
02:19:30,017 --> 02:19:32,370
- And actually you have this beautiful expression

3439
02:19:32,370 --> 02:19:34,950
that I love that that a great programming language.

3440
02:19:34,950 --> 02:19:39,120
Like Ruby has a soft ramp, the ramp goes to infinity.

3441
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:40,593
- That's exactly right. - So yeah.

3442
02:19:40,593 --> 02:19:43,137
It's super accessible, super easy to get started.

3443
02:19:43,137 --> 02:19:44,531
- And it never stops.

3444
02:19:44,531 --> 02:19:46,379
There's always more to learn.

3445
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:48,933
This is one of the reasons I'm still having fun programming.

3446
02:19:48,933 --> 02:19:50,400
That I'm still learning new things.

3447
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:52,091
I can still incorporate new things.

3448
02:19:52,091 --> 02:19:53,640
The web is deep enough as a domain.

3449
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:56,220
You're never gonna learn all of it.

3450
02:19:56,220 --> 02:19:58,883
- Provide sharp knives. - This is a good one,

3451
02:19:58,883 --> 02:20:00,360
because another way of saying this,

3452
02:20:00,360 --> 02:20:01,800
the opposite way of saying this,

3453
02:20:01,800 --> 02:20:05,924
the Java way of saying is do not provide foot guns, right?

3454
02:20:05,924 --> 02:20:08,430
I don't wanna give you sharp knives.

3455
02:20:08,430 --> 02:20:09,330
You're a child.

3456
02:20:09,330 --> 02:20:10,620
You can't handle a sharp knife.

3457
02:20:10,620 --> 02:20:12,210
Here's a dull butter knife.

3458
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:13,980
Cut your damn steak, right?

3459
02:20:13,980 --> 02:20:15,450
That's a very frustrating experience.

3460
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:16,950
You want a sharp knife

3461
02:20:16,950 --> 02:20:18,771
even though you might be able to cut yourself.

3462
02:20:18,771 --> 02:20:23,113
I trust humans in the same way that Matz trust humans.

3463
02:20:23,113 --> 02:20:25,260
Maybe you cut off a finger.

3464
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:26,760
All right, you're not gonna do that again.

3465
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:28,830
Thankfully it was a virtual think finger.

3466
02:20:28,830 --> 02:20:30,000
It's gonna grow back out.

3467
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,890
Your competence is gonna grow.

3468
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:34,980
It's more fun to work with sharp tools.

3469
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:36,210
- And that actually contributes

3470
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:38,040
to the the ramp that goes to infinity.

3471
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:39,570
- Yes, to the learning

3472
02:20:39,570 --> 02:20:42,900
- Value integrated systems. - We kind of hit on that one.

3473
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:44,970
This is Rails is trying to solve the whole problem

3474
02:20:44,970 --> 02:20:47,250
of the web, not just one little component.

3475
02:20:47,250 --> 02:20:48,990
It's not leaving you a bunch of pieces.

3476
02:20:48,990 --> 02:20:50,593
You have to put together yourself.

3477
02:20:50,593 --> 02:20:52,278
- Progress over stability.

3478
02:20:52,278 --> 02:20:53,111
- You know what?

3479
02:20:53,111 --> 02:20:54,300
If there's one that's dated,

3480
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:55,650
it's probably that one.

3481
02:20:55,650 --> 02:20:59,370
At this stage, Rails has been incredibly stable

3482
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:01,603
over many, many generations.

3483
02:21:01,603 --> 02:21:04,650
The last major release Rails 8

3484
02:21:04,650 --> 02:21:06,810
was basically a no upgrade

3485
02:21:06,810 --> 02:21:08,400
for anyone running Rail 7.

3486
02:21:08,400 --> 02:21:10,590
Rail 7 was almost a no upgrade

3487
02:21:10,590 --> 02:21:12,120
for anyone running Rail 6.

3488
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:15,442
I used to think it required more churn

3489
02:21:15,442 --> 02:21:20,442
to get progress to stay on the leading edge of new stuff.

3490
02:21:21,008 --> 02:21:25,093
And I wrote this before I experienced the indignity

3491
02:21:25,093 --> 02:21:28,590
of the 2010s in the JavaScript community.

3492
02:21:28,590 --> 02:21:32,820
Where it seemed like stability was not just unvalued,

3493
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:34,710
it was actually despised

3494
02:21:34,710 --> 02:21:37,440
that churn in and of itself was a value

3495
02:21:37,440 --> 02:21:38,670
we should be pursuing.

3496
02:21:38,670 --> 02:21:40,920
If you were still working with the same framework

3497
02:21:40,920 --> 02:21:43,290
three months later you were an idiot.

3498
02:21:43,290 --> 02:21:45,120
And I saw that and I actually recoiled.

3499
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:47,035
And if I was gonna write the doctrine today,

3500
02:21:47,035 --> 02:21:48,390
I'd write that differently.

3501
02:21:48,390 --> 02:21:50,263
I wouldn't say progress over stability.

3502
02:21:50,263 --> 02:21:53,048
- Well maybe it'd be a function of the age

3503
02:21:53,048 --> 02:21:55,380
of the programming language also.

3504
02:21:55,380 --> 02:21:59,190
- Maybe, or a deeper understanding of the problem.

3505
02:21:59,190 --> 02:22:01,800
I think part of what's so fascinating about technology

3506
02:22:01,800 --> 02:22:03,330
is that we have this perception

3507
02:22:03,330 --> 02:22:06,050
that everything constantly moves so fast.

3508
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:07,500
No, it doesn't.

3509
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:10,025
Everything moves at a glacial pace.

3510
02:22:10,025 --> 02:22:13,435
There is occasionally a paradigm shift

3511
02:22:13,435 --> 02:22:16,050
like what's happening with AI right now.

3512
02:22:16,050 --> 02:22:18,000
Like what happened with the introduction

3513
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,040
of the iPhone in 2007,

3514
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,560
like what happened with the internet in '95.

3515
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:24,660
That's basically the total sum of my career.

3516
02:22:24,660 --> 02:22:26,151
Three things changed.

3517
02:22:26,151 --> 02:22:28,290
Everything else in between

3518
02:22:28,290 --> 02:22:31,560
was incremental small improvements.

3519
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:35,580
You can recognize a Rails application written in 2003.

3520
02:22:35,580 --> 02:22:38,520
I know because the Basecamp I wrote back then

3521
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:41,310
is still operating, making millions of dollars in ARR,

3522
02:22:41,310 --> 02:22:43,470
servings in customers on the initial version

3523
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:44,880
that was launched back then.

3524
02:22:44,880 --> 02:22:46,410
And it looks like the Rails code

3525
02:22:46,410 --> 02:22:48,450
if I squint a little that I would write today.

3526
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:51,660
So most things don't change even in computing.

3527
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:52,890
And that's actually a good thing.

3528
02:22:52,890 --> 02:22:55,590
We saw with the JavaScript ecosystem.

3529
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:56,640
What happens when everyone

3530
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:59,070
gets just mad about constant churn?

3531
02:22:59,070 --> 02:23:00,330
Things don't change that often.

3532
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:02,243
- By the way, on that small tangent.

3533
02:23:02,243 --> 02:23:06,660
You just sort of visibly, verbally changed your mind

3534
02:23:06,660 --> 02:23:09,930
with the you of 15 years ago.

3535
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:11,849
- Yes. - That's interesting.

3536
02:23:11,849 --> 02:23:14,767
Have you noticed yourself changing your mind

3537
02:23:14,767 --> 02:23:17,077
quite a bit over the years?

3538
02:23:17,077 --> 02:23:20,160
- I would say, oh yes.

3539
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:21,450
And then also, oh no,

3540
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:24,060
in the sense that there are absolutely fundamental things

3541
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:25,650
both about human nature,

3542
02:23:25,650 --> 02:23:27,630
about institutions, about programming,

3543
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:30,240
about business that I've changed my mind on.

3544
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,040
And then I've also had experiences

3545
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:33,630
that are almost even more interesting

3546
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:36,060
where I thought I had changed my mind

3547
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:37,470
and I tried it a new way,

3548
02:23:37,470 --> 02:23:41,100
realized why I had the original opinion in the first place

3549
02:23:41,100 --> 02:23:42,415
and then gone back to it.

3550
02:23:42,415 --> 02:23:44,428
So it happens both ways.

3551
02:23:44,428 --> 02:23:46,590
An example of the later part, for example,

3552
02:23:46,590 --> 02:23:48,870
was managers at 37signals.

3553
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:50,610
For the longest time,

3554
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:53,112
I would Rail against engineering managers

3555
02:23:53,112 --> 02:23:56,220
as an unnecessary burden

3556
02:23:56,220 --> 02:23:58,590
on a small or even medium sized company.

3557
02:23:58,590 --> 02:24:00,300
And at one point I actually started

3558
02:24:00,300 --> 02:24:01,590
doubting myself a little bit.

3559
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:03,600
I started thinking like, do you know what?

3560
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:07,290
Maybe all programmers do need a one-on-one therapy session

3561
02:24:07,290 --> 02:24:09,180
every week with their engineering manager

3562
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:11,182
to be a whole individual.

3563
02:24:11,182 --> 02:24:13,170
So we tried that for a couple years

3564
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:15,450
where we hired some very good engineering managers

3565
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:17,010
who did engineering management

3566
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:18,270
the way you're supposed to do it,

3567
02:24:18,270 --> 02:24:20,696
the way it's done all over the place.

3568
02:24:20,696 --> 02:24:24,780
And after that I thought like, no, no, I was right.

3569
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:25,613
This was correct.

3570
02:24:25,613 --> 02:24:27,570
We should not have had managers.

3571
02:24:27,570 --> 02:24:30,180
Not every programmer needs a therapy session

3572
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:31,890
with an engineering manager every week.

3573
02:24:31,890 --> 02:24:35,430
We don't need these and least scheduled huddles.

3574
02:24:35,430 --> 02:24:36,263
We don't need all these meetings.

3575
02:24:36,263 --> 02:24:38,880
We just need to leave people the hell alone

3576
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:41,310
to work on problems that they enjoy

3577
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:43,740
for long stretches of uninterrupted time.

3578
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:45,930
That is where happiness is found.

3579
02:24:45,930 --> 02:24:47,520
That's where productivity is found.

3580
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:50,670
And if you can get away with it, you absolutely should.

3581
02:24:50,670 --> 02:24:53,580
Engineering management is a necessary evil

3582
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:54,900
when that breaks down.

3583
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:56,935
- What's the case for managers then?

3584
02:24:56,935 --> 02:24:58,200
- The case for managers

3585
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:00,330
is that if you do have a lot of people.

3586
02:25:00,330 --> 02:25:03,097
There's a bunch of work that kind of just crops up.

3587
02:25:03,097 --> 02:25:04,230
The one-on-one is one example

3588
02:25:04,230 --> 02:25:06,450
that programmers need someone to check in with.

3589
02:25:06,450 --> 02:25:09,360
There's another idealized version that someone needs

3590
02:25:09,360 --> 02:25:11,910
to guide the career of juniors, for example,

3591
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:13,980
to give them redirecting feedback

3592
02:25:13,980 --> 02:25:15,270
and all this other stuff.

3593
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:18,300
And it's not that in the abstract,

3594
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:20,160
I don't agree with some of those things,

3595
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,895
but in practice I've found

3596
02:25:21,895 --> 02:25:25,141
that they often create more problems that they solve.

3597
02:25:25,141 --> 02:25:29,638
And a good example here is can you get feedback

3598
02:25:29,638 --> 02:25:33,660
from someone who's not better at your job than you are?

3599
02:25:33,660 --> 02:25:34,710
You get some feedback.

3600
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:36,900
You can get feedback on how you show up at work.

3601
02:25:36,900 --> 02:25:39,240
Are you being courteous to others?

3602
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:40,920
Are you being a good communicator?

3603
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:43,170
Okay, yes. But you can't get feedback on your work

3604
02:25:43,170 --> 02:25:45,231
and that's more important.

3605
02:25:45,231 --> 02:25:46,064
It's more important that you work

3606
02:25:46,064 --> 02:25:48,266
under and with someone who's better at your job

3607
02:25:48,266 --> 02:25:51,070
than you are if you wish to progress in your career.

3608
02:25:51,070 --> 02:25:53,439
And every single programmer I've ever worked with

3609
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:55,470
was far more interested in progressing

3610
02:25:55,470 --> 02:25:57,510
in their career on that metric,

3611
02:25:57,510 --> 02:25:59,100
getting better at their craft

3612
02:25:59,100 --> 02:26:01,770
than they were in picking up pointers

3613
02:26:01,770 --> 02:26:04,377
that a middle manager could teach them.

3614
02:26:04,377 --> 02:26:06,540
That's not saying that there isn't value in it.

3615
02:26:06,540 --> 02:26:07,800
It's not saying there isn't value

3616
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,660
in being a better person or a better communicator.

3617
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:10,890
Of course there is all those things.

3618
02:26:10,890 --> 02:26:12,900
But if I have to choose one or the other,

3619
02:26:12,900 --> 02:26:15,630
I value competence higher.

3620
02:26:15,630 --> 02:26:19,140
Like that's again, I caveat this a million times

3621
02:26:19,140 --> 02:26:21,060
because I know what people sometimes hear.

3622
02:26:21,060 --> 02:26:23,700
They hear the genius asshole

3623
02:26:23,700 --> 02:26:25,380
is just fine and that's great

3624
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:28,590
and you should excuse all sorts of malicious behavior

3625
02:26:28,590 --> 02:26:30,120
if someone's just really good at what they do.

3626
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,770
I'm not saying that at all.

3627
02:26:31,770 --> 02:26:34,770
What I am saying is that the history of competence

3628
02:26:34,770 --> 02:26:35,970
is a history of learning

3629
02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:37,620
from people who are better than you,

3630
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:41,790
and that relationship should take precedence over all else

3631
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:45,330
and that relationship gets put aside a bit

3632
02:26:45,330 --> 02:26:47,160
when engineering managers introduced.

3633
02:26:47,160 --> 02:26:49,890
Now the funny thing is this conversation

3634
02:26:49,890 --> 02:26:51,720
ties back to the earlier things we were talking about.

3635
02:26:51,720 --> 02:26:54,360
Most engineering managers are actually former programmers.

3636
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:56,261
They at least no program to some extent,

3637
02:26:56,261 --> 02:26:57,960
but what I've seen time and again

3638
02:26:57,960 --> 02:27:00,210
is that they lose their touch,

3639
02:27:00,210 --> 02:27:03,150
their feel with it very, very quickly

3640
02:27:03,150 --> 02:27:07,290
and turn into pointy haired bosses very, very quickly

3641
02:27:07,290 --> 02:27:10,410
who are really good at checking for updates.

3642
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:13,020
Just seeing where we are on project A here

3643
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:15,360
if you need anything or we ready to deliver.

3644
02:27:15,360 --> 02:27:16,790
Okay, yes.

3645
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:18,660
And also, no.

3646
02:27:18,660 --> 02:27:20,730
Shut up, leave me the hell alone.

3647
02:27:20,730 --> 02:27:22,860
Let me program and then I'll come up for error.

3648
02:27:22,860 --> 02:27:24,390
I'll talk with other programmers

3649
02:27:24,390 --> 02:27:27,300
who I can spar with that we can learn something with.

3650
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:30,000
I can turn the problems over with and we can move forward.

3651
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:33,342
If you look back on the history of computer industry,

3652
02:27:33,342 --> 02:27:35,664
all the great innovation that's happened,

3653
02:27:35,664 --> 02:27:38,379
it's all been done by tiny teams

3654
02:27:38,379 --> 02:27:40,417
with no engineering managers.

3655
02:27:40,417 --> 02:27:43,710
Just full of highly skilled individuals.

3656
02:27:43,710 --> 02:27:45,663
You've had John Carmack on here.

3657
02:27:46,622 --> 02:27:49,110
I used to look up to its software so much.

3658
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:50,640
Not just because I loved quick,

3659
02:27:50,640 --> 02:27:52,500
not just because I loved what they were doing,

3660
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:55,394
but because he shared a bit about how the company worked.

3661
02:27:55,394 --> 02:27:57,900
There were no managers or maybe they had one business guy

3662
02:27:57,900 --> 02:28:00,510
doing some business stuff, but that was just to get paid.

3663
02:28:00,510 --> 02:28:01,650
Everything else was basically

3664
02:28:01,650 --> 02:28:03,450
just designers and programmers.

3665
02:28:03,450 --> 02:28:04,530
And there were about eight of them

3666
02:28:04,530 --> 02:28:06,660
and they created goddamn "Quake II."

3667
02:28:06,660 --> 02:28:08,970
So why do you need all these people again?

3668
02:28:08,970 --> 02:28:11,059
Why do you need all these managers again?

3669
02:28:11,059 --> 02:28:15,660
I think, again, at a certain scale it does break down.

3670
02:28:15,660 --> 02:28:18,270
It's hard to just have a hundred thousand programmers

3671
02:28:18,270 --> 02:28:20,610
running around wild without any

3672
02:28:20,610 --> 02:28:23,190
product mommies or daddies telling them what to do.

3673
02:28:23,190 --> 02:28:24,330
I understand that.

3674
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:26,610
And then even as I say that, I also don't understand it.

3675
02:28:26,610 --> 02:28:27,690
Yeah, because if you look at something

3676
02:28:27,690 --> 02:28:28,933
like Gmail, for example,

3677
02:28:28,933 --> 02:28:31,608
there was like a side project done by Buchheit

3678
02:28:31,608 --> 02:28:33,540
at Google at the time.

3679
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:36,593
So much of the enduring long-term value

3680
02:28:36,593 --> 02:28:38,670
of even all these huge companies

3681
02:28:38,670 --> 02:28:41,370
were created by people who didn't have a manager.

3682
02:28:41,370 --> 02:28:43,110
And that's not an accident,

3683
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:45,000
that's a direct cause and effect.

3684
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,505
So I've turned in some way even more militant

3685
02:28:47,505 --> 02:28:49,745
over the years against this notion of management,

3686
02:28:49,745 --> 02:28:51,060
at least for myself

3687
02:28:51,060 --> 02:28:53,310
and knowing who I am and how I wanna work.

3688
02:28:53,310 --> 02:28:54,650
Because the other part of this

3689
02:28:54,650 --> 02:28:56,310
is I don't want to be a manager,

3690
02:28:56,310 --> 02:28:57,843
and maybe this is just me projecting the fact

3691
02:28:57,843 --> 02:28:59,730
that I'm an introvert who don't like to talk

3692
02:28:59,730 --> 02:29:03,000
to people on one-on-one calls every week.

3693
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,350
But it also encapsulates

3694
02:29:04,350 --> 02:29:06,870
how I was able to progress my career.

3695
02:29:06,870 --> 02:29:09,300
I did not really go to the next level with Ruby

3696
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:11,970
or otherwise until I had a door I could close

3697
02:29:11,970 --> 02:29:14,570
and no one could bother me for six hours straight.

3698
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:18,060
- So in companies probably one of the reasons

3699
02:29:18,060 --> 02:29:21,105
is it's very easy to hire managers,

3700
02:29:21,105 --> 02:29:26,105
and managers also delegate responsibility from you.

3701
02:29:27,810 --> 02:29:30,030
So if you just have a bunch of programmers running around,

3702
02:29:30,030 --> 02:29:33,360
you're kind of response like it's work,

3703
02:29:33,360 --> 02:29:35,820
it's intellectual work to have to deal

3704
02:29:35,820 --> 02:29:37,560
with the the first principles

3705
02:29:37,560 --> 02:29:39,330
of every problem that's going on.

3706
02:29:39,330 --> 02:29:41,910
So managers like you can like relax,

3707
02:29:41,910 --> 02:29:43,893
oh I'll be taken care of.

3708
02:29:43,893 --> 02:29:46,667
But they then hire their own managers

3709
02:29:46,667 --> 02:29:49,440
and it just multiplies and multiplies and multiplies.

3710
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:51,760
I would love it if some of the great companies

3711
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:54,960
would have in the United States,

3712
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:56,880
if there was like an extra side branch

3713
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:58,130
that we could always run,

3714
02:29:59,190 --> 02:30:02,220
maybe physicists can come up how to split the simulation

3715
02:30:02,220 --> 02:30:04,434
to where just all the managers are removed.

3716
02:30:04,434 --> 02:30:08,010
Also just in that branch,

3717
02:30:08,010 --> 02:30:10,650
just the PR and the comms people also.

3718
02:30:10,650 --> 02:30:13,530
And even the lawyers, just the engineers

3719
02:30:13,530 --> 02:30:16,213
and let's just see and then we merge it back.

3720
02:30:16,213 --> 02:30:17,880
- I've essentially run that branch

3721
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:19,860
at 37signals for 20 years.

3722
02:30:19,860 --> 02:30:22,920
And I've experimented with forking back on the other side.

3723
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:25,350
I've experimented with having a full-time lawyer on staff.

3724
02:30:25,350 --> 02:30:27,600
I've experimented with having engineering managers.

3725
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:30,510
And I can tell you life is much better

3726
02:30:30,510 --> 02:30:33,900
at 50, 60 people when none of those individuals

3727
02:30:33,900 --> 02:30:34,950
or none of those roles.

3728
02:30:34,950 --> 02:30:36,150
It's never about the individuals.

3729
02:30:36,150 --> 02:30:37,440
It's about the roles.

3730
02:30:37,440 --> 02:30:40,603
None of those roles are in your organization fulltime.

3731
02:30:40,603 --> 02:30:42,630
Occasionally you need a manager.

3732
02:30:42,630 --> 02:30:44,605
Occasionally you need a lawyer.

3733
02:30:44,605 --> 02:30:49,260
I can play the role of manager occasionally, fine.

3734
02:30:49,260 --> 02:30:51,300
And then I can set it back down to zero.

3735
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:53,970
It's almost like a cloud surface.

3736
02:30:53,970 --> 02:30:55,590
I wanna a manager service

3737
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:58,230
I can call on for seven hours this week

3738
02:30:58,230 --> 02:31:00,030
and then I wanna take it down to zero

3739
02:31:00,030 --> 02:31:01,110
for the next three months.

3740
02:31:01,110 --> 02:31:03,556
- Yeah. I read. I don't know if this is still the case,

3741
02:31:03,556 --> 02:31:05,803
that Basecamp is an LLC and doesn't have a CFO,

3742
02:31:05,803 --> 02:31:07,552
like a full-time accountant.

3743
02:31:07,552 --> 02:31:09,632
Was that upgrade? - So the funniest.

3744
02:31:09,632 --> 02:31:11,880
These days, we do have a head of finance.

3745
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:16,880
We did not for the first 19 years of life, I think.

3746
02:31:16,905 --> 02:31:18,630
We got away with basically

3747
02:31:18,630 --> 02:31:21,450
just an accountant do our books

3748
02:31:21,450 --> 02:31:23,550
in the same way you would do a small ice cream shop,

3749
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:25,530
except we would over time have done

3750
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:27,093
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

3751
02:31:27,093 --> 02:31:29,520
The scale seemed quirky.

3752
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:31,920
And at some point, you can also fall in love

3753
02:31:31,920 --> 02:31:32,940
with your own quirkiness

3754
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:34,920
to a degree that isn't actually healthy.

3755
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:36,540
And I've certainly done that over time

3756
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:38,460
and we should have had someone mount

3757
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:40,080
or count the beans

3758
02:31:40,080 --> 02:31:41,414
a little more diligently, a little earlier.

3759
02:31:41,414 --> 02:31:44,190
This was part of a blessing

3760
02:31:44,190 --> 02:31:46,710
of just being wildly profitable and selling software

3761
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:49,110
that can have infinite margins basically

3762
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:50,940
that you kind of can get away with a bunch of stuff

3763
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:52,320
that you perhaps shouldn't.

3764
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:54,540
What partially taught me this lesson

3765
02:31:54,540 --> 02:31:59,100
was when we realized we had not been collecting sales tax

3766
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:01,720
in different US states where we had Nexus.

3767
02:32:01,720 --> 02:32:03,570
And it took us about two years

3768
02:32:03,570 --> 02:32:05,910
and $5 million in settlements

3769
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:07,860
and cleanups to get out of that mess.

3770
02:32:07,860 --> 02:32:08,970
And after that I went like,

3771
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:10,727
okay, fine, we can hire a finance person.

3772
02:32:10,727 --> 02:32:13,770
And we now have a wonderful finance person, Ron,

3773
02:32:13,770 --> 02:32:16,230
who actually ended up replacing something else.

3774
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:18,300
We used to have a full-time data analytics

3775
02:32:18,300 --> 02:32:22,530
person who would do all sorts of insight mining

3776
02:32:22,530 --> 02:32:24,120
for why are people signing up for this thing.

3777
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:25,860
We ran that for 10 years

3778
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:26,693
and realized, you know what?

3779
02:32:26,693 --> 02:32:28,560
If I can have either a data analytics person

3780
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:30,540
or an accountant, I'm picking the accountant.

3781
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:33,120
- I love this so much on so many levels.

3782
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,370
Can we just linger on that advice that you've given

3783
02:32:35,370 --> 02:32:38,127
that small teams are better?

3784
02:32:38,127 --> 02:32:41,280
I think that's really less.

3785
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,080
Less is more.

3786
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:44,070
What did you say before?

3787
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:45,033
Worse is better.

3788
02:32:46,740 --> 02:32:47,573
Okay, I'm sorry.

3789
02:32:47,573 --> 02:32:49,860
- Worse better on adoption with technology

3790
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:50,850
a lot of times.

3791
02:32:50,850 --> 02:32:52,740
And I think actually comes out at the same thing.

3792
02:32:52,740 --> 02:32:53,880
It comes out of the fact

3793
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:56,820
that many of the great breakthroughs

3794
02:32:56,820 --> 02:33:00,480
are created by not even just tiny teams but individuals.

3795
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:02,100
Individuals writing something.

3796
02:33:02,100 --> 02:33:06,180
And an individual writing something on some parameter,

3797
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:07,710
what they do is worse.

3798
02:33:07,710 --> 02:33:10,535
Of course it's worse when one person has to make something

3799
02:33:10,535 --> 02:33:13,050
that a huge company have hundreds

3800
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:14,310
if not thousands of developers

3801
02:33:14,310 --> 02:33:16,140
that they can have work on that problem.

3802
02:33:16,140 --> 02:33:17,912
But in so many other parameters

3803
02:33:17,912 --> 02:33:20,760
that worseness is the value,

3804
02:33:20,760 --> 02:33:22,890
that less is the value.

3805
02:33:22,890 --> 02:33:25,560
In getting real, which we wrote back in 2006.

3806
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:28,247
We talk about this notion of less software.

3807
02:33:28,247 --> 02:33:31,530
When we first got started with Basecamp back in 2004,

3808
02:33:31,530 --> 02:33:32,910
people would ask us all the time,

3809
02:33:32,910 --> 02:33:35,293
aren't you petrified of Microsoft?

3810
02:33:35,293 --> 02:33:37,380
They have so many more resources.

3811
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:39,180
They have so many more programmers.

3812
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:42,480
What if they take a liking to your little niche here

3813
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:43,350
and they show up

3814
02:33:43,350 --> 02:33:46,650
and they just throw a thousand programmers at the problem?

3815
02:33:46,650 --> 02:33:48,896
And my answer perhaps partly

3816
02:33:48,896 --> 02:33:52,237
because I was like 24 was first of all,

3817
02:33:52,237 --> 02:33:54,360
no, no care in the world.

3818
02:33:54,360 --> 02:33:55,200
But the real answer

3819
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:57,420
was they're not gonna produce the same thing.

3820
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:59,970
You cannot produce the kind of software that Basecamp is

3821
02:33:59,970 --> 02:34:02,250
with a team of a thousand people.

3822
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:04,290
You will build the kind of software

3823
02:34:04,290 --> 02:34:05,842
that a thousand people builds.

3824
02:34:05,842 --> 02:34:08,513
And that's not the same thing at all.

3825
02:34:08,513 --> 02:34:11,970
So much of the main breakthrough

3826
02:34:11,970 --> 02:34:13,320
in both end user systems

3827
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:15,510
but also in open source systems

3828
02:34:15,510 --> 02:34:16,380
and fundamental systems,

3829
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:19,196
they're done by individuals or very small teams.

3830
02:34:19,196 --> 02:34:23,100
Even all these classical histories of Apple

3831
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:24,802
has always been like, well it was a big organization

3832
02:34:24,802 --> 02:34:26,760
but then you had the team

3833
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:28,020
that was actually working on the breakthrough.

3834
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:29,040
It was four people.

3835
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:30,020
It was eight people.

3836
02:34:30,020 --> 02:34:31,980
It was never 200.

3837
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:36,060
- And large teams seems to slow things down.

3838
02:34:36,060 --> 02:34:38,430
- Yes. - It's so fascinating

3839
02:34:38,430 --> 02:34:39,995
and part of it's the manager thing.

3840
02:34:39,995 --> 02:34:42,142
- Because humans don't scale.

3841
02:34:42,142 --> 02:34:45,690
Communication between humans certainly don't scale.

3842
02:34:45,690 --> 02:34:48,690
You basically get the network cost effect

3843
02:34:48,690 --> 02:34:52,589
every time you add a new node, it goes up exponentially.

3844
02:34:52,589 --> 02:34:55,650
This is perhaps the key thing

3845
02:34:55,650 --> 02:34:58,080
of why I get to be so fond

3846
02:34:58,080 --> 02:35:00,090
of having no managers at Basecamp,

3847
02:35:00,090 --> 02:35:02,418
because our default team size is two.

3848
02:35:02,418 --> 02:35:06,598
One programmer, one designer, one feature.

3849
02:35:06,598 --> 02:35:09,390
When you're operating at that level of scale,

3850
02:35:09,390 --> 02:35:11,250
you don't need sophistication.

3851
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:14,520
You don't need advanced methodologies.

3852
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:16,590
You don't need multiple layers of management

3853
02:35:16,590 --> 02:35:18,480
because you can just do.

3854
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:21,180
The magic of small teams is that they just do.

3855
02:35:21,180 --> 02:35:22,650
They don't have to argue

3856
02:35:22,650 --> 02:35:24,390
because we don't have to set direction,

3857
02:35:24,390 --> 02:35:26,400
we don't have to worry about the roadmap.

3858
02:35:26,400 --> 02:35:28,740
We can just sit down and make something

3859
02:35:28,740 --> 02:35:30,030
and then see if it's good.

3860
02:35:30,030 --> 02:35:31,830
When you can get away with just making things,

3861
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:33,219
you don't have to plan.

3862
02:35:33,219 --> 02:35:35,220
And if you can get out of planning,

3863
02:35:35,220 --> 02:35:38,130
you can follow the truth

3864
02:35:38,130 --> 02:35:41,100
that emerges from the code, from the product,

3865
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:43,230
from the thing you're working on in the moment.

3866
02:35:43,230 --> 02:35:44,910
You know far more about

3867
02:35:44,910 --> 02:35:47,040
what the great next step is,

3868
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:48,420
when you're one step behind

3869
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:51,720
rather than if you try 18 months in advance

3870
02:35:51,720 --> 02:35:53,130
to map out all the steps.

3871
02:35:53,130 --> 02:35:55,521
How do we get from here to very far away?

3872
02:35:55,521 --> 02:35:56,850
You know what?

3873
02:35:56,850 --> 02:35:59,130
That's difficult to imagine in advance

3874
02:35:59,130 --> 02:36:01,710
because humans are very poor at that.

3875
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:04,163
Maybe AI one day will be much better than us,

3876
02:36:04,163 --> 02:36:07,230
but humans can take one foot

3877
02:36:07,230 --> 02:36:08,700
or put one foot in front of each other.

3878
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:11,460
That's not that hard and that allows you

3879
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:14,340
to get away with all that sophistication.

3880
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:16,080
So the process has become much simpler.

3881
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:18,150
You need far fewer people, it compounds.

3882
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:20,160
You need much less process.

3883
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:22,320
You need to waste less time in meetings.

3884
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:25,260
You can just spend these long glorious days

3885
02:36:25,260 --> 02:36:27,030
and weeks of uninterrupted time

3886
02:36:27,030 --> 02:36:30,304
solving real problems you care about and that are valuable

3887
02:36:30,304 --> 02:36:32,130
and you're gonna find

3888
02:36:32,130 --> 02:36:33,960
that's what the market actually wants.

3889
02:36:33,960 --> 02:36:35,670
No one is buying something

3890
02:36:35,670 --> 02:36:37,770
because there's a huge company behind it.

3891
02:36:37,770 --> 02:36:38,700
Most of the time.

3892
02:36:38,700 --> 02:36:40,650
They're buying something because it's good.

3893
02:36:40,650 --> 02:36:42,000
And the way you get something good

3894
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:46,800
is you don't sit around and have a meeting about it.

3895
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:47,730
You try stuff.

3896
02:36:47,730 --> 02:36:48,563
You build stuff.

3897
02:36:48,563 --> 02:36:51,120
- It really is kind of incredible what one person,

3898
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:54,870
honestly one person can do in 100 hours

3899
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:58,530
of deep work of focused work, even less.

3900
02:36:58,530 --> 02:36:59,700
- So I'll tell you this,

3901
02:36:59,700 --> 02:37:01,890
I tracked exactly the number of hours

3902
02:37:01,890 --> 02:37:03,750
I spent on the first version of Basecamp.

3903
02:37:03,750 --> 02:37:05,280
And I was doing this because at the time

3904
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:09,180
I was working on a contract basis for Jason,

3905
02:37:09,180 --> 02:37:12,041
he was paying me, I was gonna say $15 an hour.

3906
02:37:12,041 --> 02:37:13,920
That's what I got paid when we first got started.

3907
02:37:13,920 --> 02:37:16,020
I think he had bumped my pay to a glorious 25.

3908
02:37:16,020 --> 02:37:18,118
But I was billing him

3909
02:37:18,118 --> 02:37:20,280
and I know that the invoice

3910
02:37:20,280 --> 02:37:23,040
for the first vision of Basecamp was 400 hours.

3911
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:27,187
That's what it took for one sole individual in 2004

3912
02:37:28,230 --> 02:37:30,540
to create an entire system that has then gone

3913
02:37:30,540 --> 02:37:32,430
on to gross hundreds of millions of dollars

3914
02:37:32,430 --> 02:37:35,700
and continues to do extremely well.

3915
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:38,820
One person just me setting up everything.

3916
02:37:38,820 --> 02:37:40,230
Part of that story is Ruby.

3917
02:37:40,230 --> 02:37:41,400
Part of that story is Rails.

3918
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:44,343
But a lot of it is also just me plus Jason,

3919
02:37:44,343 --> 02:37:46,440
plus Ryan, plus Matt.

3920
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:48,691
That was the entire company at the time.

3921
02:37:48,691 --> 02:37:53,113
And we could create something of sheer sustaining value

3922
02:37:53,113 --> 02:37:55,980
with such a tiny team, because we were a tiny team.

3923
02:37:55,980 --> 02:37:57,210
Not to spite off.

3924
02:37:57,210 --> 02:37:59,100
Small is not a stepping stone.

3925
02:37:59,100 --> 02:38:01,620
This is the other thing that people get into their head.

3926
02:38:01,620 --> 02:38:04,197
This is one of the big topics of "Rework."

3927
02:38:04,197 --> 02:38:06,240
That it gave entrepreneurs

3928
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,041
the permission to embrace being a small team.

3929
02:38:09,041 --> 02:38:12,090
Not as a way point, not as like I'm trying

3930
02:38:12,090 --> 02:38:13,931
to become a thousand people.

3931
02:38:13,931 --> 02:38:16,170
No, I actually like being a small team.

3932
02:38:16,170 --> 02:38:17,700
Small teams are more fun.

3933
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:19,295
If you ask almost anyone,

3934
02:38:19,295 --> 02:38:21,630
I'm sure Tobi would say this too,

3935
02:38:21,630 --> 02:38:23,280
even at his scale,

3936
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:25,470
the sheer enjoyment of building something

3937
02:38:25,470 --> 02:38:28,221
is in the enjoyment of building it with a tiny team.

3938
02:38:28,221 --> 02:38:31,650
Now you can have impact at a different scale

3939
02:38:31,650 --> 02:38:32,610
when you have a huge company.

3940
02:38:32,610 --> 02:38:35,580
I fully recognize that and I see the appeal of it.

3941
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:37,290
But in the actual building of things,

3942
02:38:37,290 --> 02:38:39,810
it's always small teams, always.

3943
02:38:39,810 --> 02:38:40,643
- How do you protect the small team.

3944
02:38:40,643 --> 02:38:44,370
Basecamp has successfully stayed small.

3945
02:38:44,370 --> 02:38:47,360
Has been the dragon, and you had to fight off.

3946
02:38:47,360 --> 02:38:49,713
That like basically you make a lot of money.

3947
02:38:50,790 --> 02:38:53,580
There's a temptation to grow.

3948
02:38:53,580 --> 02:38:55,380
So how do you not grow?

3949
02:38:55,380 --> 02:38:57,096
- Don't take venture capital.

3950
02:38:57,096 --> 02:38:59,833
- Okay, that's step one. - That is point number one.

3951
02:38:59,833 --> 02:39:01,230
- First of all, - Point number two

3952
02:39:01,230 --> 02:39:02,580
everybody takes venture capital.

3953
02:39:02,580 --> 02:39:03,950
So you already went.

3954
02:39:03,950 --> 02:39:07,110
- I mean that's been the answer for the longest time.

3955
02:39:07,110 --> 02:39:08,730
Because the problem isn't just venture capital,

3956
02:39:08,730 --> 02:39:10,440
it's other people's money.

3957
02:39:10,440 --> 02:39:12,330
Once you take other people's money,

3958
02:39:12,330 --> 02:39:14,790
completely understandably, they want a return

3959
02:39:14,790 --> 02:39:17,340
and they would prefer to have the largest return possible.

3960
02:39:17,340 --> 02:39:19,293
'Cause not them sitting in the code.

3961
02:39:19,293 --> 02:39:21,420
It's not them getting the daily satisfaction

3962
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:22,380
out of building something.

3963
02:39:22,380 --> 02:39:26,460
Chiseling beautiful code poems out of the editor, right?

3964
02:39:26,460 --> 02:39:27,720
They don't get that satisfaction.

3965
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:29,490
They get the satisfaction maybe of seeing

3966
02:39:29,490 --> 02:39:31,710
something nice put into the world, that's fair.

3967
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:33,300
But they certainly also get a satisfaction

3968
02:39:33,300 --> 02:39:34,380
of a higher return.

3969
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:37,650
And there is this sense certainly in venture capital,

3970
02:39:37,650 --> 02:39:39,510
stated in venture capital

3971
02:39:39,510 --> 02:39:41,550
that the whole point of you taking the money

3972
02:39:41,550 --> 02:39:43,950
is to get to a billion dollars or more.

3973
02:39:43,950 --> 02:39:46,170
Now the path to that

3974
02:39:46,170 --> 02:39:49,620
usually does go through running established playbooks

3975
02:39:49,620 --> 02:39:51,180
and then when it comes to software,

3976
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:54,194
the enterprise sales playbook is that playbook.

3977
02:39:54,194 --> 02:39:56,946
If you're doing B2B software SaaS,

3978
02:39:56,946 --> 02:39:59,730
you will try to find product market fit.

3979
02:39:59,730 --> 02:40:00,810
And the second you have it,

3980
02:40:00,810 --> 02:40:03,510
you will abandon your small and medium sized accounts

3981
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:06,660
to chase the big whales with a huge sales force

3982
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:09,260
and by then you're a thousand people and life sucks.

3983
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:13,583
- That said, I mean people are just curious about this.

3984
02:40:13,583 --> 02:40:17,340
I've gotten a chance to get to know Jeff Bezos.

3985
02:40:17,340 --> 02:40:22,340
He invested in Basecamp, not controlling?

3986
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:24,204
- He bought secondaries.

3987
02:40:24,204 --> 02:40:26,070
So this was the funny thing

3988
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:29,430
is that when investing have these two dual meanings.

3989
02:40:29,430 --> 02:40:31,140
Normally when people think about investing,

3990
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:34,620
they think you're putting in growth capital

3991
02:40:34,620 --> 02:40:36,710
because you want the business to hire more people

3992
02:40:36,710 --> 02:40:39,258
to do more R&Ds so they can grow bigger.

3993
02:40:39,258 --> 02:40:41,070
Bezos didn't do that actually.

3994
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:44,713
He bought a ownership stake directly from Jason and I,

3995
02:40:44,713 --> 02:40:48,330
and 100% of the proceeds of that purchase

3996
02:40:48,330 --> 02:40:51,000
went into my and Jason's bank account,

3997
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,080
personal bank account.

3998
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:55,277
Not a single cent went into the account of the company

3999
02:40:55,277 --> 02:40:57,420
'cause we didn't need the money to grow.

4000
02:40:57,420 --> 02:41:00,930
What we needed or what we certainly enjoyed

4001
02:41:00,930 --> 02:41:04,920
was to some extent maybe the vote of confidence,

4002
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:08,170
but more so the security

4003
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:10,590
of taking a little bit off the table

4004
02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:13,440
is that we dare turn down the big bucks

4005
02:41:13,440 --> 02:41:14,700
from venture capitals.

4006
02:41:14,700 --> 02:41:16,800
It was essentially a vaccine

4007
02:41:16,800 --> 02:41:19,380
against wanting to take a larger check

4008
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:21,780
from people who then wanted to take the company

4009
02:41:21,780 --> 02:41:24,240
to something enormous that we didn't want to go with it.

4010
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:28,011
So Jeff gave Jason and I just enough money

4011
02:41:28,011 --> 02:41:31,350
that we were comfortable turning all these people down

4012
02:41:31,350 --> 02:41:34,260
in a way where if it had turned belly up

4013
02:41:34,260 --> 02:41:35,310
like six months later,

4014
02:41:35,310 --> 02:41:36,840
we wouldn't have been kicking ourselves

4015
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:40,140
and going, we had something here that was worth millions

4016
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:41,640
and now we have nothing

4017
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:44,132
and I have to worry about rent and groceries again.

4018
02:41:44,132 --> 02:41:45,750
- It is a vote of confidence.

4019
02:41:45,750 --> 02:41:49,950
I wonder from, I'd love to hear Jeff's side of the story

4020
02:41:49,950 --> 02:41:54,393
of like why, 'cause he doesn't need like the money.

4021
02:41:55,980 --> 02:41:56,813
So it's really,

4022
02:41:56,813 --> 02:41:59,280
I think it probably is just believing in people

4023
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:02,790
and wanting to have cool stuff be created in the world

4024
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:05,040
and make money off of it, but not like.

4025
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:09,124
- 100% the motivation for Jeff wasn't a return,

4026
02:42:09,124 --> 02:42:11,640
because he actually has a team.

4027
02:42:11,640 --> 02:42:14,353
He's private office that runs these investments

4028
02:42:14,353 --> 02:42:18,690
who did the calculus on the investment pitch we gave him,

4029
02:42:18,690 --> 02:42:20,280
which was so ridiculous

4030
02:42:20,280 --> 02:42:22,500
that Jason and I were laughing our asses off

4031
02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:24,930
when we were writing down our metrics.

4032
02:42:24,930 --> 02:42:26,250
I was like, no one's gonna pay this.

4033
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:28,260
No one is gonna give us this multiple

4034
02:42:28,260 --> 02:42:30,060
of this amount of revenue.

4035
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:31,050
And that's fine.

4036
02:42:31,050 --> 02:42:32,880
I mean we took the call

4037
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:36,000
essentially out of kind of an awe

4038
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:37,753
that Jeff Bezos even wanted to look at us and like,

4039
02:42:37,753 --> 02:42:38,850
do you know what?

4040
02:42:38,850 --> 02:42:39,720
We don't want venture capital.

4041
02:42:39,720 --> 02:42:41,130
We don't need other people's money,

4042
02:42:41,130 --> 02:42:43,108
but like let's just give him a bullshit number

4043
02:42:43,108 --> 02:42:45,480
that no sane person would actually say yes to.

4044
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:48,180
And then I mean, we can each go our own way.

4045
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:50,490
And his investment team said like, "Jeff, no way.

4046
02:42:50,490 --> 02:42:52,410
This makes no economic sense at all.

4047
02:42:52,410 --> 02:42:53,880
They're asking for way too much money

4048
02:42:53,880 --> 02:42:55,620
with way too little revenue."

4049
02:42:55,620 --> 02:42:57,000
And Jeff just went like, "I don't care.

4050
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:58,230
I wanna invest in this guy."

4051
02:42:58,230 --> 02:43:00,773
Because to him at the time it was chump change, right?

4052
02:43:00,773 --> 02:43:03,243
Like Jason and I each got a few million dollars.

4053
02:43:03,243 --> 02:43:06,120
I mean whatever the currency swing

4054
02:43:06,120 --> 02:43:07,590
between the yen and the dollar

4055
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:09,840
that day probably moved 10 x

4056
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:12,540
that for his net worth than our investment did.

4057
02:43:12,540 --> 02:43:14,400
Jeff seemed genuinely interested

4058
02:43:14,400 --> 02:43:17,490
in being around interesting people,

4059
02:43:17,490 --> 02:43:20,640
interesting companies, helping someone go to distance.

4060
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:24,420
And I actually look back on that relationship

4061
02:43:24,420 --> 02:43:26,010
with some degree of regret,

4062
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:29,501
because I took that vote of confidence for granted

4063
02:43:29,501 --> 02:43:31,890
in ways that I'm a little bit ashamed of

4064
02:43:31,890 --> 02:43:34,860
over the years I've been more critical about

4065
02:43:34,860 --> 02:43:37,560
some of the things that Amazon had done

4066
02:43:37,560 --> 02:43:40,714
that I feel now is sort of justified.

4067
02:43:40,714 --> 02:43:44,430
So that's just sort of part of that processing of it.

4068
02:43:44,430 --> 02:43:46,478
But on the economic sense,

4069
02:43:46,478 --> 02:43:48,720
he gave us that confidence.

4070
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:49,920
He gave us the economic confidence,

4071
02:43:49,920 --> 02:43:53,700
but then he also gave us the confidence of a CEO running

4072
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:55,770
perhaps at the time the most important

4073
02:43:55,770 --> 02:43:57,868
internet business in the US.

4074
02:43:57,868 --> 02:43:59,700
Showing up to our calls,

4075
02:43:59,700 --> 02:44:01,937
which we would have with him like once a year

4076
02:44:01,937 --> 02:44:04,080
and basically just going like, yeah,

4077
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:05,340
you guys are doing awesome stuff.

4078
02:44:05,340 --> 02:44:06,930
You should just keep doing awesome stuff.

4079
02:44:06,930 --> 02:44:08,490
I read your book, it's awesome.

4080
02:44:08,490 --> 02:44:09,780
You launched this thing, it's awesome.

4081
02:44:09,780 --> 02:44:10,890
You should just do more of that.

4082
02:44:10,890 --> 02:44:12,256
I don't actually know how to run your business.

4083
02:44:12,256 --> 02:44:13,089
You guys know it.

4084
02:44:13,089 --> 02:44:14,400
- So the book goes out.

4085
02:44:14,400 --> 02:44:15,911
I'm just so, from a fan perspective,

4086
02:44:15,911 --> 02:44:20,911
I'm curious about how Jeff Bezos was able to see,

4087
02:44:21,459 --> 02:44:22,830
'cause to me, you and Jason,

4088
02:44:22,830 --> 02:44:25,107
like especially humans in the space of tech.

4089
02:44:25,107 --> 02:44:27,930
And the fact that Jeff was able to see that, right?

4090
02:44:27,930 --> 02:44:29,340
How hard is it to see that?

4091
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:31,020
- He certainly saw it very early.

4092
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:32,970
And I think this is something that Jeff does better

4093
02:44:32,970 --> 02:44:34,380
than almost anyone else.

4094
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:37,519
He spots that opportunity so far in advance

4095
02:44:37,519 --> 02:44:39,990
of anyone else even opened their eyes to it,

4096
02:44:39,990 --> 02:44:42,300
or certain he is willing to bet on it

4097
02:44:42,300 --> 02:44:45,150
far early and far harder than anyone else is.

4098
02:44:45,150 --> 02:44:47,190
And he's just right time and again.

4099
02:44:47,190 --> 02:44:49,740
I mean, we were not the only investment that he made.

4100
02:44:49,740 --> 02:44:54,740
And certainly Amazon had a extremely long-term vision.

4101
02:44:55,590 --> 02:45:00,000
So far longer than I have ever had the gumption to keep.

4102
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,550
Like I think of myself as a long-term thinker.

4103
02:45:02,550 --> 02:45:04,560
I am playing a child's game

4104
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:06,390
compared to the game that Jeff is playing.

4105
02:45:06,390 --> 02:45:09,570
Like when I looked at Amazon's economics

4106
02:45:09,570 --> 02:45:12,360
around the dot-com boom and bust, they looked ridiculous.

4107
02:45:12,360 --> 02:45:14,130
Like they were losing so much money.

4108
02:45:14,130 --> 02:45:16,396
They were so hated by the market they were...

4109
02:45:16,396 --> 02:45:18,390
no one believed that it was gonna turn

4110
02:45:18,390 --> 02:45:19,920
into what it is, but Jeff did.

4111
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:23,250
In a way that that level of conviction I really aspire to.

4112
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:25,440
And I think that's one of the main things

4113
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:27,720
I've taken away from that relationship

4114
02:45:27,720 --> 02:45:30,690
is that you can just believe in yourself

4115
02:45:30,690 --> 02:45:33,990
to that degree against those odds.

4116
02:45:33,990 --> 02:45:35,190
That's ridiculous.

4117
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:38,640
He did that at so many times our level

4118
02:45:38,640 --> 02:45:41,429
that it's pathetic if I'm doubting myself.

4119
02:45:41,429 --> 02:45:45,783
- Yeah, I think Amazon is one of those companies.

4120
02:45:46,735 --> 02:45:48,930
I mean, it's come under a bunch of criticism

4121
02:45:48,930 --> 02:45:50,013
over the years.

4122
02:45:51,450 --> 02:45:52,773
This is something about humans

4123
02:45:52,773 --> 02:45:54,390
that don't appreciate so much

4124
02:45:54,390 --> 02:45:55,890
that we take for granted the positive

4125
02:45:55,890 --> 02:45:58,585
that a thing brings real quick

4126
02:45:58,585 --> 02:46:00,660
and then we just start criticizing the thing.

4127
02:46:00,660 --> 02:46:02,109
It's the Wi-Fi and the airplanes.

4128
02:46:02,109 --> 02:46:03,514
- [DHH] That's exactly it.

4129
02:46:03,514 --> 02:46:05,953
- But I think Amazon,

4130
02:46:05,953 --> 02:46:10,260
there could be a case made that Amazon

4131
02:46:10,260 --> 02:46:13,860
is one of the greatest companies

4132
02:46:13,860 --> 02:46:15,750
in the last a hundred years

4133
02:46:15,750 --> 02:46:18,180
- For sure, I think it's an easy case to make.

4134
02:46:18,180 --> 02:46:21,540
What I also think is that the price you pay

4135
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:23,670
to be one of the greatest companies

4136
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:24,570
in the last a hundred years

4137
02:46:26,303 --> 02:46:27,510
is a lot of detractors, a lot of pushback,

4138
02:46:27,510 --> 02:46:28,890
a lot of criticism

4139
02:46:28,890 --> 02:46:31,672
that this is actually order restored in the universe.

4140
02:46:31,672 --> 02:46:34,353
One of my favorite teachers in all the time

4141
02:46:34,353 --> 02:46:37,072
I've been on the internet is Kathy Sierra.

4142
02:46:37,072 --> 02:46:38,640
I don't know if you know her work,

4143
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:41,370
but she was actually Vern a few short years

4144
02:46:41,370 --> 02:46:43,500
before the cruel internet ran her off.

4145
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:46,208
But she wrote a blog called Creating Passionate Users

4146
02:46:46,208 --> 02:46:49,205
and she carved into my brain

4147
02:46:49,205 --> 02:46:51,894
this notion of balance in the universe.

4148
02:46:51,894 --> 02:46:54,030
If you are creating something of value

4149
02:46:54,030 --> 02:46:58,390
that a lot of people love, you must create an equal

4150
02:46:58,390 --> 02:47:01,200
and opposite force of haters.

4151
02:47:01,200 --> 02:47:03,570
You cannot have people who love what you do

4152
02:47:03,570 --> 02:47:05,609
without also having people who hate what you do.

4153
02:47:05,609 --> 02:47:09,000
The only escape from that is mediocrity.

4154
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,350
If you are so boring

4155
02:47:10,350 --> 02:47:12,390
and so uninteresting that no one gives a damn

4156
02:47:12,390 --> 02:47:15,210
whether you exist or not, yeah, you don't get the haters,

4157
02:47:15,210 --> 02:47:16,860
but you also don't get the impact of people

4158
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:18,450
who really enjoy your work.

4159
02:47:18,450 --> 02:47:21,570
And I think Amazon is that just at the massive scale, right?

4160
02:47:21,570 --> 02:47:24,510
They brought so much value and change

4161
02:47:24,510 --> 02:47:27,330
to technology to commerce

4162
02:47:27,330 --> 02:47:31,290
that they must simply have a black hole size of haters,

4163
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:33,970
otherwise the universe is simply gonna tip over.

4164
02:47:33,970 --> 02:47:36,264
- Let me ask you about small teams.

4165
02:47:36,264 --> 02:47:39,014
So you mentioned Jason a bunch of times, Jason Fried,

4166
02:47:39,014 --> 02:47:41,875
you have been partners for a long, long time.

4167
02:47:41,875 --> 02:47:43,830
Perhaps it's fair to say he's more

4168
02:47:43,830 --> 02:47:46,200
on the sort of the design business side

4169
02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:49,790
and you're like the tech, the engineering wizard.

4170
02:47:49,790 --> 02:47:52,320
How have you guys over all these years

4171
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:55,680
creating so many amazing products, not murder each other?

4172
02:47:55,680 --> 02:47:58,023
It's a great story of like partnership.

4173
02:47:58,920 --> 02:48:00,840
What can you say about collaboration?

4174
02:48:00,840 --> 02:48:04,020
What can you say that about Jason that you love

4175
02:48:04,020 --> 02:48:05,283
that you've learned from?

4176
02:48:06,150 --> 02:48:07,680
Why does this work?

4177
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:09,120
- So first I'll say we have tried

4178
02:48:09,120 --> 02:48:11,670
to murder each other several times over the years,

4179
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:14,760
but far less, I think in the last decade.

4180
02:48:14,760 --> 02:48:17,040
In the early days,

4181
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:22,040
our product discussions were so fierce

4182
02:48:22,650 --> 02:48:24,420
that when we were having them in the office

4183
02:48:24,420 --> 02:48:26,580
and there were other employees around,

4184
02:48:26,580 --> 02:48:28,470
some of them were legitimately worried

4185
02:48:28,470 --> 02:48:30,510
that the company was about to fall apart.

4186
02:48:30,510 --> 02:48:34,162
Because the volume coming out of the room

4187
02:48:34,162 --> 02:48:38,790
would be so high and sound so acrimonious,

4188
02:48:38,790 --> 02:48:40,650
that they were legitimately worried

4189
02:48:40,650 --> 02:48:42,210
the whole thing was gonna fall apart.

4190
02:48:42,210 --> 02:48:43,320
But you know what's funny

4191
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:45,723
is that it never felt like that in the moment.

4192
02:48:45,723 --> 02:48:50,490
It always felt like just a peak vigorous search

4193
02:48:50,490 --> 02:48:52,083
for something better.

4194
02:48:53,161 --> 02:48:57,180
And that we were able to stomach

4195
02:48:57,180 --> 02:49:02,180
that level of adversity on the merits of an idea

4196
02:49:02,310 --> 02:49:04,890
because it was about the idea.

4197
02:49:04,890 --> 02:49:07,470
It wasn't about the person

4198
02:49:07,470 --> 02:49:10,050
and it never really got personal.

4199
02:49:10,050 --> 02:49:12,060
Not even never really, it didn't get personal.

4200
02:49:12,060 --> 02:49:14,640
It wasn't like, Jason, you're an asshole.

4201
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:16,770
It was like, Jason, you're an idiot.

4202
02:49:16,770 --> 02:49:17,603
And you're an idiot

4203
02:49:17,603 --> 02:49:19,800
because you're looking at this problem the wrong way.

4204
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:21,420
And let me tell you the right way to do it.

4205
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:23,190
- As a small tangent, let me say this.

4206
02:49:23,190 --> 02:49:26,099
Some people have said, oh, probably return to this,

4207
02:49:26,099 --> 02:49:31,099
that you're sometimes can have flights of temper

4208
02:49:33,270 --> 02:49:34,800
on the internet and so on.

4209
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:36,420
I never take it that way

4210
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:38,370
because it is the same kind of ilk.

4211
02:49:38,370 --> 02:49:42,000
Maybe I haven't seen the right kind of traces of temper,

4212
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,980
but usually it's about the idea

4213
02:49:43,980 --> 02:49:45,813
and it's just excited, passionate human.

4214
02:49:45,813 --> 02:49:48,720
- That's exactly what I like to think of it as.

4215
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:50,560
It doesn't always come across as that.

4216
02:49:50,560 --> 02:49:54,089
And I can see why spectators in particular sometimes

4217
02:49:54,089 --> 02:49:57,484
would see something that looks like I'm going after

4218
02:49:57,484 --> 02:49:59,233
the man rather than the ball.

4219
02:49:59,233 --> 02:50:02,340
And I do think I've tried to get better at that.

4220
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:04,178
But in my relationship with Jason,

4221
02:50:04,178 --> 02:50:05,880
I think it's worked so well

4222
02:50:05,880 --> 02:50:09,990
because we have our own distinct areas of competence

4223
02:50:09,990 --> 02:50:12,030
where we fully trust each other.

4224
02:50:12,030 --> 02:50:15,173
Jason trusts me to make the correct technical decisions.

4225
02:50:15,173 --> 02:50:17,852
I trust him to make the correct design

4226
02:50:17,852 --> 02:50:19,830
and product direction decisions,

4227
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:22,800
and then we can overlap and share on the business,

4228
02:50:22,800 --> 02:50:25,884
on marketing, on writing, on other aspects of it.

4229
02:50:25,884 --> 02:50:29,610
So that's one thing is that if you're starting a business

4230
02:50:29,610 --> 02:50:32,370
with someone where you do exactly the same as they do

4231
02:50:32,370 --> 02:50:34,710
and you're constantly contesting

4232
02:50:34,710 --> 02:50:37,058
who's the more competent person,

4233
02:50:37,058 --> 02:50:40,072
I think that's far more difficult and far more volatile.

4234
02:50:40,072 --> 02:50:41,310
So if you're starting a business

4235
02:50:41,310 --> 02:50:42,330
and you're both programmers

4236
02:50:42,330 --> 02:50:44,830
and you both work on the same kind of programming,

4237
02:50:46,170 --> 02:50:48,390
ah, good luck.

4238
02:50:48,390 --> 02:50:49,350
I think that's hard.

4239
02:50:49,350 --> 02:50:51,060
I tried to pick an easier path

4240
02:50:51,060 --> 02:50:53,280
working with a designer where I knew

4241
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:55,470
that at least half of the time

4242
02:50:55,470 --> 02:50:58,620
I could just delegate to his experience and competence

4243
02:50:58,620 --> 02:50:59,700
and say like, do you know what?

4244
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:01,397
I may have an opinion,

4245
02:51:01,397 --> 02:51:02,910
I have an opinion all the time on design.

4246
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:06,840
But I don't have to win the argument because I trust you.

4247
02:51:06,840 --> 02:51:09,030
Now occasionally we would have overlaps

4248
02:51:09,030 --> 02:51:10,530
on business or direction

4249
02:51:10,530 --> 02:51:12,150
where we'd both feel

4250
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:14,670
like we had a strong stake in the game

4251
02:51:14,670 --> 02:51:17,790
and we both had a claim to competence in that area.

4252
02:51:17,790 --> 02:51:20,160
But then for whatever reason,

4253
02:51:20,160 --> 02:51:22,680
we also both had a long-term vision

4254
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:24,120
were I would go, do you know what?

4255
02:51:24,120 --> 02:51:25,470
I think we're wrong here.

4256
02:51:25,470 --> 02:51:27,750
But as I learned from Jeff Bezos, by the way,

4257
02:51:27,750 --> 02:51:29,490
I'm gonna disagree and commit.

4258
02:51:29,490 --> 02:51:30,840
That was one of those early lessons

4259
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:32,490
he gave us that was absolutely crucial

4260
02:51:32,490 --> 02:51:34,740
and perhaps even instrumental

4261
02:51:34,740 --> 02:51:36,810
in ensuring that Jason and I have been working together

4262
02:51:36,810 --> 02:51:39,300
for a quarter of a century.

4263
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:40,290
Disagree and commit

4264
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:42,360
is one of the old time Jeff Bezos greats.

4265
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:46,144
- I'm just surprised that Yoko Ono hasn't come along.

4266
02:51:46,144 --> 02:51:47,160
You know what I mean?

4267
02:51:47,160 --> 02:51:51,480
Like there's so many Yokos in this world.

4268
02:51:51,480 --> 02:51:52,890
- It might have happened.

4269
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:56,640
If not in part because we don't sit on each other's lap

4270
02:51:56,640 --> 02:51:57,870
all the time.

4271
02:51:57,870 --> 02:51:59,070
Most of our careers,

4272
02:51:59,070 --> 02:52:01,501
we haven't even lived in the same city.

4273
02:52:01,501 --> 02:52:04,320
Like I lived in Chicago for a couple of years

4274
02:52:04,320 --> 02:52:05,610
while we were getting going

4275
02:52:05,610 --> 02:52:07,920
after I'd moved to the US in 2005.

4276
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:10,170
But then I moved to Malibu and then I lived in Spain

4277
02:52:10,170 --> 02:52:11,280
and then I lived in Copenhagen.

4278
02:52:11,280 --> 02:52:15,318
And Jason and I from the foundation of our relationship

4279
02:52:15,318 --> 02:52:17,608
learned how to work together

4280
02:52:17,608 --> 02:52:20,880
in a remarkably efficient way

4281
02:52:20,880 --> 02:52:23,520
where we didn't have to actually talk that much.

4282
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:25,560
On any given week, I'd be surprised

4283
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:29,250
if Jason and I spent more than two hours

4284
02:52:29,250 --> 02:52:33,390
of direct exchange and communication.

4285
02:52:33,390 --> 02:52:35,753
- Yeah, sometimes it's the basic human frictions

4286
02:52:35,753 --> 02:52:37,590
that you just accumulate. - Yes, I think you rub up

4287
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:39,132
against another person,

4288
02:52:39,132 --> 02:52:41,730
that person well better be your spouse

4289
02:52:41,730 --> 02:52:43,020
if it's too much for too long.

4290
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:45,067
- Yeah, but even there. - Even there.

4291
02:52:45,067 --> 02:52:46,803
- COVID has really test the relationship.

4292
02:52:46,803 --> 02:52:48,180
It's fascinating to watch.

4293
02:52:48,180 --> 02:52:51,022
- It has, and I do think that having some separation,

4294
02:52:51,022 --> 02:52:52,890
which is kind of counterintuitive

4295
02:52:52,890 --> 02:52:54,450
because I think a lot of people think

4296
02:52:54,450 --> 02:52:56,820
the more collaboration you can have, the better.

4297
02:52:56,820 --> 02:52:59,370
The more ideas that can bounce back and forth, the better.

4298
02:52:59,370 --> 02:53:01,560
And both Jason and I, for whatever reason,

4299
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:03,240
came to the conclusion early on in careers.

4300
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:06,180
Absolutely not, that's complete baloney.

4301
02:53:06,180 --> 02:53:09,300
This is why we were huge proponents of remote work.

4302
02:53:09,300 --> 02:53:12,900
This is why I enjoy working in my home office

4303
02:53:12,900 --> 02:53:15,000
where I can close the door and not see another human

4304
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,190
for like six hours at the time.

4305
02:53:17,190 --> 02:53:19,650
I don't wanna bounce ideas off you all the time.

4306
02:53:19,650 --> 02:53:22,020
I wanna bounce ideas off you occasionally

4307
02:53:22,020 --> 02:53:24,540
and then I wanna go off and implement those ideas.

4308
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:26,513
There's way too much bouncing going on

4309
02:53:26,513 --> 02:53:29,040
and not enough scoring, not enough dunking.

4310
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:31,962
And I think this is one of the great traps

4311
02:53:31,962 --> 02:53:34,898
of executive rule.

4312
02:53:34,898 --> 02:53:38,130
Once a founder elevates themselves

4313
02:53:38,130 --> 02:53:39,420
all the way up to an executive

4314
02:53:39,420 --> 02:53:41,070
where what they're doing

4315
02:53:41,070 --> 02:53:42,300
is just telling other people what to do,

4316
02:53:42,300 --> 02:53:44,370
that's the realm they live in 24/7.

4317
02:53:44,370 --> 02:53:45,930
They just live in the idea realm.

4318
02:53:45,930 --> 02:53:47,220
Oh, I can just tell more people

4319
02:53:47,220 --> 02:53:49,080
more things what to do and we can just see it happen.

4320
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:51,450
If you actually have to be part of implementing that,

4321
02:53:51,450 --> 02:53:52,530
you slow your horse.

4322
02:53:52,530 --> 02:53:53,909
You think like, do you know what?

4323
02:53:53,909 --> 02:53:55,530
I had a good idea last week.

4324
02:53:55,530 --> 02:53:57,240
I'm gonna save the rest of my good ideas

4325
02:53:57,240 --> 02:53:58,680
until next month.

4326
02:53:58,680 --> 02:54:00,232
- And there is a temptation for the managers

4327
02:54:00,232 --> 02:54:04,150
and for the people in the executive layer

4328
02:54:05,076 --> 02:54:06,600
to do something,

4329
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:09,231
which that's something usually means a meeting, right?

4330
02:54:09,231 --> 02:54:11,160
And so that's why you say...

4331
02:54:11,160 --> 02:54:13,020
- Their job is telling other people what to do.

4332
02:54:13,020 --> 02:54:14,760
- Yeah, and the meeting,

4333
02:54:14,760 --> 02:54:16,830
so this is one of the big things you're against

4334
02:54:16,830 --> 02:54:19,140
is meeting... - Meetings are toxic.

4335
02:54:19,140 --> 02:54:21,000
And this really I think ties

4336
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:22,900
into this with Jason and I.

4337
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:25,560
If I had to count out the total number of meetings

4338
02:54:25,560 --> 02:54:28,500
we've had in 24 years of collaborations

4339
02:54:28,500 --> 02:54:30,420
where we in person sat in front of each other

4340
02:54:30,420 --> 02:54:32,160
and discussed a topic,

4341
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:34,470
I probably it'd be less than whatever,

4342
02:54:34,470 --> 02:54:36,720
three months at a fan company.

4343
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:38,370
We just haven't done that that much.

4344
02:54:38,370 --> 02:54:39,780
We haven't worn it out.

4345
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:41,640
One of this funny metaphors

4346
02:54:41,640 --> 02:54:44,227
that Trump came up with at one point

4347
02:54:44,227 --> 02:54:47,910
was a human has like a limited number of steps

4348
02:54:47,910 --> 02:54:48,750
in their life, right?

4349
02:54:48,750 --> 02:54:50,670
Like that's the longevity argument here.

4350
02:54:50,670 --> 02:54:53,306
You could do so much activity and then you run out.

4351
02:54:53,306 --> 02:54:55,350
There's some kernel in that idea

4352
02:54:55,350 --> 02:54:57,030
that can be applied to relationship.

4353
02:54:57,030 --> 02:54:59,400
There's some amount of exchange we can have.

4354
02:54:59,400 --> 02:55:01,890
There's some amount of time we can spend together

4355
02:55:01,890 --> 02:55:03,857
where you can wear it out.

4356
02:55:03,857 --> 02:55:07,460
Jason and I were diligent about not wearing each other out.

4357
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:09,750
And I think that is absolutely key

4358
02:55:09,750 --> 02:55:12,210
to the longevity of the relationship

4359
02:55:12,210 --> 02:55:14,460
combined with that level of trust.

4360
02:55:14,460 --> 02:55:16,530
And then just combining with the level

4361
02:55:16,530 --> 02:55:18,210
that we really like the work itself.

4362
02:55:18,210 --> 02:55:20,100
We don't just like the brainstorming.

4363
02:55:20,100 --> 02:55:22,517
The say where we just come up with good ideas.

4364
02:55:22,517 --> 02:55:24,660
No, we like to do the ideas

4365
02:55:24,660 --> 02:55:27,450
and we like to be part of that process directly ourselves.

4366
02:55:27,450 --> 02:55:29,550
I like to program, he likes to do design.

4367
02:55:29,550 --> 02:55:31,200
We could go off and do our little things

4368
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:32,540
for long stretches of time.

4369
02:55:32,540 --> 02:55:33,570
In case you, come together

4370
02:55:33,570 --> 02:55:35,640
and go like, hey, let's launch a great product.

4371
02:55:35,640 --> 02:55:39,243
- This might sound like I'm asking you to do therapy,

4372
02:55:40,140 --> 02:55:43,230
but I find myself to sometimes

4373
02:55:43,230 --> 02:55:48,133
want or long for a meeting because I'm lonely.

4374
02:55:48,133 --> 02:55:53,009
Like 'cause it remote work is just sitting by yourself.

4375
02:55:53,009 --> 02:55:54,960
I don't know, it can get really lonely

4376
02:55:54,960 --> 02:55:56,760
for long stretches of time.

4377
02:55:56,760 --> 02:55:58,663
- Let me give you a tip, get a wife.

4378
02:56:01,116 --> 02:56:03,177
- Yes, oh, goddammit.

4379
02:56:03,177 --> 02:56:04,659
- Get a couple kids.

4380
02:56:04,659 --> 02:56:05,492
- [Lex] All right.

4381
02:56:05,492 --> 02:56:08,610
- Like family really is the great antidote to loneliness.

4382
02:56:08,610 --> 02:56:11,700
And I mean that as sincerely as I can possibly say it.

4383
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:14,845
I certainly had exactly that feeling you described

4384
02:56:14,845 --> 02:56:16,020
early in my career

4385
02:56:16,020 --> 02:56:18,510
when I was working remotely and I was just a, like

4386
02:56:18,510 --> 02:56:21,133
me living in an apartment.

4387
02:56:21,133 --> 02:56:23,466
A total stereotype where for the longest time

4388
02:56:23,466 --> 02:56:24,960
when I first moved to Chicago,

4389
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:27,390
all I had on the floor was a mattress

4390
02:56:27,390 --> 02:56:29,689
and then I bought this big TV and I didn't even mount it.

4391
02:56:29,689 --> 02:56:31,890
And then I had a stack of DVDs.

4392
02:56:31,890 --> 02:56:33,270
And I was basically,

4393
02:56:33,270 --> 02:56:34,493
I was working a lot of time

4394
02:56:34,493 --> 02:56:37,458
and then I would just go home and do that.

4395
02:56:37,458 --> 02:56:39,840
And it wasn't great.

4396
02:56:39,840 --> 02:56:41,070
It really wasn't.

4397
02:56:41,070 --> 02:56:43,470
Like I do think that humans need humans.

4398
02:56:43,470 --> 02:56:45,630
And if you can't get them at work

4399
02:56:45,630 --> 02:56:47,670
and I actually sort of kind of don't want them at work,

4400
02:56:47,670 --> 02:56:49,530
at least I don't want 'em for 40 hours a week.

4401
02:56:49,530 --> 02:56:51,120
That's not what I prefer.

4402
02:56:51,120 --> 02:56:51,990
You need something else.

4403
02:56:51,990 --> 02:56:53,580
You need other relationships in your life,

4404
02:56:53,580 --> 02:56:56,310
and there's no greater depth of relationship

4405
02:56:56,310 --> 02:56:57,510
if you can find someone

4406
02:56:57,510 --> 02:57:00,330
that you actually just wanna spend a lot of time with.

4407
02:57:00,330 --> 02:57:01,163
That's key to it.

4408
02:57:01,163 --> 02:57:02,790
And I think it's key for both Jason and I

4409
02:57:02,790 --> 02:57:06,417
that we've had families for quite a long time

4410
02:57:06,417 --> 02:57:08,787
and it grounds you two in a way

4411
02:57:08,787 --> 02:57:12,420
where the sprint of a startup

4412
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:15,750
can get traded in for the marathon

4413
02:57:15,750 --> 02:57:17,670
of an enduring company.

4414
02:57:17,670 --> 02:57:19,620
And you get settled in a way.

4415
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:22,187
We talked briefly about sometimes I get fired up.

4416
02:57:22,187 --> 02:57:23,310
I mean a lot of times,

4417
02:57:23,310 --> 02:57:26,228
maybe even most of the times I get fired up about topics,

4418
02:57:26,228 --> 02:57:29,272
but I don't get fired up in the same way now

4419
02:57:29,272 --> 02:57:31,530
as I used to when I was 24.

4420
02:57:31,530 --> 02:57:33,990
I'm still extremely passionate about ideas

4421
02:57:33,990 --> 02:57:35,340
and trying to find the right things,

4422
02:57:35,340 --> 02:57:38,641
but having a family meeting, my wife,

4423
02:57:38,641 --> 02:57:42,780
building a life around that

4424
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:45,120
has just mellowed everything out

4425
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:48,244
in a completely cliche way.

4426
02:57:48,244 --> 02:57:50,984
But I think it's actually key.

4427
02:57:50,984 --> 02:57:55,410
I think if we could get more even younger people

4428
02:57:55,410 --> 02:57:57,920
not to wait until they were in the late goddamn 30s

4429
02:57:57,920 --> 02:58:01,830
or early 40s to hitch up with someone,

4430
02:58:01,830 --> 02:58:02,663
we'd be better off

4431
02:58:02,663 --> 02:58:05,671
and we'd have more stable business relationships as well

4432
02:58:05,671 --> 02:58:09,792
because folks would get that nurturing human

4433
02:58:09,792 --> 02:58:11,130
relations somewhere else.

4434
02:58:11,130 --> 02:58:12,930
Now when I say all of that,

4435
02:58:12,930 --> 02:58:15,450
I also accept that there are plenty of great businesses

4436
02:58:15,450 --> 02:58:17,010
that's been built over the years

4437
02:58:17,010 --> 02:58:18,150
that have not been built remote,

4438
02:58:18,150 --> 02:58:21,000
that have been built by a gang of hooligans

4439
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,880
sitting in an office for immense hours of time.

4440
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:25,170
I mean, both John Carmack

4441
02:58:25,170 --> 02:58:27,780
and Tim Sweeney talked about that in the '90s

4442
02:58:27,780 --> 02:58:31,230
with their careers that that was just basically work, sleep,

4443
02:58:31,230 --> 02:58:33,780
hang out with the guys at the office, right?

4444
02:58:33,780 --> 02:58:34,982
A totally fair.

4445
02:58:34,982 --> 02:58:36,810
That never appealed to me.

4446
02:58:36,810 --> 02:58:39,660
Both Jason and I saw eye to eye on the idea

4447
02:58:39,660 --> 02:58:43,140
that 40 hours a week dedicated to work was enough

4448
02:58:43,140 --> 02:58:45,360
that if we were gonna go to distance

4449
02:58:45,360 --> 02:58:47,750
for not just the five to seven years

4450
02:58:47,750 --> 02:58:51,420
it takes to build a VC case up to an exit.

4451
02:58:51,420 --> 02:58:55,170
But for potentially 10 years, 20 years or further,

4452
02:58:55,170 --> 02:58:57,486
we needed to become whole humans.

4453
02:58:57,486 --> 02:59:00,516
Because the only that whole humanness

4454
02:59:00,516 --> 02:59:02,520
was gonna go to distance,

4455
02:59:02,520 --> 02:59:04,172
which included building up

4456
02:59:04,172 --> 02:59:08,107
friendships outside of work, having hobbies,

4457
02:59:08,107 --> 02:59:12,870
finding a mate and having a family.

4458
02:59:12,870 --> 02:59:17,870
And that entire higher existence,

4459
02:59:18,570 --> 02:59:20,691
those legs of the stool

4460
02:59:20,691 --> 02:59:22,755
that work is not the only thing in life

4461
02:59:22,755 --> 02:59:26,580
is completely related to the fact

4462
02:59:26,580 --> 02:59:28,611
that we've been around for 25 years.

4463
02:59:28,611 --> 02:59:30,450
There's way too much,

4464
02:59:30,450 --> 02:59:33,525
especially in America of false trade-offs.

4465
02:59:33,525 --> 02:59:35,580
Oh, you wanna build a successful business?

4466
02:59:35,580 --> 02:59:38,520
Well, you can either have money enjoyment

4467
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:40,300
or family or health pick one.

4468
02:59:40,300 --> 02:59:43,770
What? Why do we have to give up all of this?

4469
02:59:43,770 --> 02:59:45,777
Now again, I'm not saying,

4470
02:59:45,777 --> 02:59:48,600
and there are moments of payers in life

4471
02:59:48,600 --> 02:59:49,433
where you can sprint.

4472
02:59:49,433 --> 02:59:52,525
But I am saying if that sprint turns into a decade,

4473
02:59:52,525 --> 02:59:54,226
you're gonna pay for it.

4474
02:59:54,226 --> 02:59:55,835
And you can pay for it in ways.

4475
02:59:55,835 --> 02:59:58,230
I've seen time and again

4476
02:59:58,230 --> 03:00:01,440
seem like a very bad trade that even if it works.

4477
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:03,013
And by the way, most of the time it does not.

4478
03:00:03,013 --> 03:00:04,908
Most of the time startups go bust.

4479
03:00:04,908 --> 03:00:07,460
Most of the time people spend five, seven years

4480
03:00:07,460 --> 03:00:09,570
or something that does not pan out

4481
03:00:09,570 --> 03:00:11,210
and they don't get the payout

4482
03:00:11,210 --> 03:00:13,350
and then they just sit with regret of like,

4483
03:00:13,350 --> 03:00:15,000
what the fuck happened to my 20s?

4484
03:00:16,620 --> 03:00:19,890
Early on, Jason and I basically made the pact

4485
03:00:19,890 --> 03:00:20,760
that working together

4486
03:00:20,760 --> 03:00:22,950
was not gonna lead to that kind of regret.

4487
03:00:22,950 --> 03:00:25,181
That we were gonna allow ourselves and each other

4488
03:00:25,181 --> 03:00:29,370
to build a whole life outside of work.

4489
03:00:29,370 --> 03:00:33,750
And the fact that that worked

4490
03:00:33,750 --> 03:00:38,040
is something I feel is almost like forbidden knowledge,

4491
03:00:38,040 --> 03:00:40,200
certainly in technology circles in the US.

4492
03:00:40,200 --> 03:00:42,630
It's something that we've tried to champion for 20 years

4493
03:00:42,630 --> 03:00:43,650
and we still get slack.

4494
03:00:43,650 --> 03:00:47,250
For just two days ago, I had another Twitter beef

4495
03:00:47,250 --> 03:00:48,607
with someone saying like,

4496
03:00:48,607 --> 03:00:50,040
"Oh, well okay, maybe it worked,

4497
03:00:50,040 --> 03:00:51,630
but you didn't turn into Atlassian.

4498
03:00:51,630 --> 03:00:52,759
So you're a failure.

4499
03:00:52,759 --> 03:00:56,173
Basecamp isn't Jira, so why are you even bothering?"

4500
03:00:56,173 --> 03:01:01,173
And it's such a fascinating winner-takes-all mentality

4501
03:01:01,222 --> 03:01:04,620
that unless you dominate everyone else

4502
03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:06,346
in all the ways you've lost.

4503
03:01:06,346 --> 03:01:11,346
When so much of life is far more open to multiple winners

4504
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:15,060
where we can end up with a business

4505
03:01:15,060 --> 03:01:16,920
that have made hundreds of millions of dollars

4506
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:17,753
over the years,

4507
03:01:17,753 --> 03:01:21,690
and we've kept much of that to do whatever we want

4508
03:01:21,690 --> 03:01:24,360
and that's enough.

4509
03:01:24,360 --> 03:01:25,590
That's good, that's great.

4510
03:01:25,590 --> 03:01:29,905
That's actually something worth aspiring to.

4511
03:01:29,905 --> 03:01:32,190
Certainly it should be a path

4512
03:01:32,190 --> 03:01:34,410
for someone to consider choosing

4513
03:01:34,410 --> 03:01:38,250
rather than the VC unicorn of bust mentality

4514
03:01:38,250 --> 03:01:39,390
that dominates everything.

4515
03:01:39,390 --> 03:01:40,997
- Yeah, I'd love to ask you about this exchange

4516
03:01:40,997 --> 03:01:43,080
so you can explain to me the whole saga,

4517
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:45,630
but so just to link on that a little bit

4518
03:01:45,630 --> 03:01:47,430
is I think there's a notion

4519
03:01:47,430 --> 03:01:51,360
that success for a tech founder

4520
03:01:51,360 --> 03:01:55,920
is like work for a few years all out

4521
03:01:55,920 --> 03:02:00,630
and then exit, sort of sell your company for, I don't know,

4522
03:02:00,630 --> 03:02:01,920
hundreds of millions of dollars.

4523
03:02:01,920 --> 03:02:03,300
That's success.

4524
03:02:03,300 --> 03:02:05,310
When it seems in reality,

4525
03:02:05,310 --> 03:02:08,970
when you look at who the people like you,

4526
03:02:08,970 --> 03:02:12,150
like really smart, creative humans,

4527
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:16,350
who they actually are and what happiness entails.

4528
03:02:16,350 --> 03:02:19,503
It actually entails working your whole life a little bit.

4529
03:02:19,503 --> 03:02:22,440
It's like because you actually love the programming,

4530
03:02:22,440 --> 03:02:25,025
you love the building, you love the designer

4531
03:02:25,025 --> 03:02:27,657
and you don't want to exit.

4532
03:02:27,657 --> 03:02:29,220
And that's something you've talked about

4533
03:02:29,220 --> 03:02:31,500
really eloquently about.

4534
03:02:31,500 --> 03:02:33,480
So like you actually want to create a life

4535
03:02:33,480 --> 03:02:36,450
where you're always doing the building

4536
03:02:36,450 --> 03:02:37,350
and doing it in a way

4537
03:02:37,350 --> 03:02:39,990
that's not completely taken over your life.

4538
03:02:39,990 --> 03:02:41,970
- Mojito Island is a mirage.

4539
03:02:41,970 --> 03:02:43,050
It always was.

4540
03:02:43,050 --> 03:02:45,390
There is no retirement for ambitious people.

4541
03:02:45,390 --> 03:02:47,310
There is no just sitting back on the beach

4542
03:02:47,310 --> 03:02:49,830
and sipping a mojito for what?

4543
03:02:49,830 --> 03:02:52,438
For two weeks before you go damn crazy

4544
03:02:52,438 --> 03:02:54,720
and wanna get back into the action?

4545
03:02:54,720 --> 03:02:56,677
That's exactly what happens to most people

4546
03:02:56,677 --> 03:03:00,120
who have the capacity to build those kinds of exits.

4547
03:03:00,120 --> 03:03:02,880
I've never seen, I shouldn't say never.

4548
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:05,700
I've almost never seen anyone be able to pull that off.

4549
03:03:05,700 --> 03:03:08,910
Yet so many think that that's why they're doing it.

4550
03:03:08,910 --> 03:03:10,890
That's why they're sacrificing everything.

4551
03:03:10,890 --> 03:03:13,890
Because once I get to the finish line, I'm golden.

4552
03:03:13,890 --> 03:03:17,460
I've won, I can retire, I can sit back, I can just relax.

4553
03:03:17,460 --> 03:03:18,840
And you find out

4554
03:03:18,840 --> 03:03:22,419
that that kind of relaxation is actually hell.

4555
03:03:22,419 --> 03:03:26,880
It's hell for creative people to squander

4556
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:30,630
their God-given creative juices and capacities.

4557
03:03:30,630 --> 03:03:35,460
And I was really lucky to read the book "Flow"

4558
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:38,280
by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

4559
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:39,660
early on - Nice,

4560
03:03:39,660 --> 03:03:40,870
the pronunciations, spot on. - You know what?

4561
03:03:40,870 --> 03:03:42,120
I had to practice that

4562
03:03:42,120 --> 03:03:43,770
with AI over the last few days

4563
03:03:43,770 --> 03:03:45,300
because I knew I was gonna cite him

4564
03:03:45,300 --> 03:03:47,298
and I butchered his name several times.

4565
03:03:47,298 --> 03:03:49,658
So AI taught me how to pronounce that,

4566
03:03:49,658 --> 03:03:52,020
at least somewhat correctly.

4567
03:03:52,020 --> 03:03:56,340
But his main work over his career

4568
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:58,530
was essentially the concept of flow

4569
03:03:58,530 --> 03:04:03,530
that came out of a search for understanding happiness.

4570
03:04:04,680 --> 03:04:05,730
Why are some people happy?

4571
03:04:05,730 --> 03:04:07,110
When are they happy?

4572
03:04:07,110 --> 03:04:09,210
And what he learned was quite illuminating.

4573
03:04:09,210 --> 03:04:11,010
He learned that people aren't happy

4574
03:04:11,010 --> 03:04:12,330
when they sit on Mojito Island.

4575
03:04:12,330 --> 03:04:13,740
They're not happy when they're free

4576
03:04:13,740 --> 03:04:15,329
of all obligations and responsibilities.

4577
03:04:15,329 --> 03:04:18,721
No, they're happy in these moments

4578
03:04:18,721 --> 03:04:22,623
where they're reaching and stretching their capacities

4579
03:04:22,623 --> 03:04:24,873
just beyond what they can currently do.

4580
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:27,090
In those moments of flow,

4581
03:04:27,090 --> 03:04:29,370
they can forget time and space.

4582
03:04:29,370 --> 03:04:30,260
They can sit in front

4583
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:32,910
of the key board program a hard problem,

4584
03:04:32,910 --> 03:04:34,770
think 20 minutes have passed

4585
03:04:34,770 --> 03:04:36,690
and suddenly it's been three hours.

4586
03:04:36,690 --> 03:04:38,370
They look back upon those moments

4587
03:04:38,370 --> 03:04:40,260
with the greatest amount of joy.

4588
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:42,480
And that is what peak happiness is.

4589
03:04:42,480 --> 03:04:46,650
If you take away the pursuit of those kinds of problems,

4590
03:04:46,650 --> 03:04:49,187
if you eliminate all the problems from your plate,

4591
03:04:49,187 --> 03:04:51,930
you're gonna get depressed.

4592
03:04:51,930 --> 03:04:53,790
You're are not gonna have a good time.

4593
03:04:53,790 --> 03:04:55,410
Now there are people who can do that,

4594
03:04:55,410 --> 03:04:56,430
but they're not the same kind of people

4595
03:04:56,430 --> 03:04:58,170
who built these kinds of companies.

4596
03:04:58,170 --> 03:05:01,050
So you have to accept the kind of individual you are.

4597
03:05:01,050 --> 03:05:04,668
If you are on this path, don't bullshit yourself.

4598
03:05:04,668 --> 03:05:06,366
Don't bullshit yourself into thinking,

4599
03:05:06,366 --> 03:05:08,280
I'm just gonna sacrifice everything,

4600
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:11,108
my health, my family, my hobbies, my friends,

4601
03:05:11,108 --> 03:05:13,770
but in 10 years I'm gonna make it all up

4602
03:05:13,770 --> 03:05:15,270
because in 10 years I can do it.

4603
03:05:15,270 --> 03:05:16,440
It never works out like that.

4604
03:05:16,440 --> 03:05:18,810
It doesn't work out on both ends of it.

4605
03:05:18,810 --> 03:05:19,643
It does not work out

4606
03:05:19,643 --> 03:05:21,090
if you're successful and you sell your company,

4607
03:05:21,090 --> 03:05:22,690
because you'll get bored out of your mind

4608
03:05:22,690 --> 03:05:24,480
after two weeks on retirement.

4609
03:05:24,480 --> 03:05:27,420
It doesn't work out if the company is a failure

4610
03:05:27,420 --> 03:05:30,330
and you regret the last 10 years spent for nothing.

4611
03:05:30,330 --> 03:05:32,490
It doesn't work out if it all works

4612
03:05:32,490 --> 03:05:33,630
and you stay in the business

4613
03:05:33,630 --> 03:05:35,400
because it never gets any easier.

4614
03:05:35,400 --> 03:05:38,970
So you're gonna fail on all metrics if you just go,

4615
03:05:38,970 --> 03:05:40,560
there's only work and nothing else.

4616
03:05:40,560 --> 03:05:43,200
And I didn't want that.

4617
03:05:43,200 --> 03:05:45,240
I wanted the happiness of flow.

4618
03:05:45,240 --> 03:05:48,801
I understood that insight was true,

4619
03:05:48,801 --> 03:05:50,310
but I wanted to do it in a way

4620
03:05:50,310 --> 03:05:53,580
where I could sustain the journey for 40 or 50 years.

4621
03:05:53,580 --> 03:05:55,980
- And there's another other interesting caveat

4622
03:05:55,980 --> 03:05:57,714
that I've heard you say

4623
03:05:57,714 --> 03:06:00,090
is that if you do exit and you sell your company

4624
03:06:00,090 --> 03:06:02,623
and you wanna stay in, you wanna do another company

4625
03:06:02,623 --> 03:06:06,017
that's going to usually not be as fulfilling.

4626
03:06:06,017 --> 03:06:08,806
Because really your first baby, like.

4627
03:06:08,806 --> 03:06:12,930
- You can't do it again or most people can't do it again.

4628
03:06:12,930 --> 03:06:15,000
A, because their second idea

4629
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:16,470
is not gonna be as good as the first one.

4630
03:06:16,470 --> 03:06:19,260
It is so rare to capture lightning in the bottle

4631
03:06:19,260 --> 03:06:21,330
like we have, for example, with Basecamp.

4632
03:06:21,330 --> 03:06:22,560
I know this from experience

4633
03:06:22,560 --> 03:06:23,400
because I've been trying to build

4634
03:06:23,400 --> 03:06:25,432
a lot of other businesses since.

4635
03:06:25,432 --> 03:06:27,165
And some of them have been moderate successes,

4636
03:06:27,165 --> 03:06:29,190
even good successes, none of them have been Basecamp.

4637
03:06:29,190 --> 03:06:31,365
It's really difficult to do that twice.

4638
03:06:31,365 --> 03:06:35,070
But founders are arrogant pricks, including myself.

4639
03:06:35,070 --> 03:06:36,840
And we like to think that, do you know what?

4640
03:06:36,840 --> 03:06:39,480
We succeeded in large part because we're just awesome.

4641
03:06:39,480 --> 03:06:41,520
We're just so much better than everyone else.

4642
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:44,160
And in some ways that's true some of the time.

4643
03:06:44,160 --> 03:06:46,045
But you can also be really good at something

4644
03:06:46,045 --> 03:06:49,859
that matters for a hot moment that door is open.

4645
03:06:49,859 --> 03:06:51,946
The door closes now you're still good at the thing,

4646
03:06:51,946 --> 03:06:53,010
but it doesn't matter.

4647
03:06:53,010 --> 03:06:54,147
No one cares.

4648
03:06:54,147 --> 03:06:55,617
There's that part of it.

4649
03:06:55,617 --> 03:06:59,175
And then there's the part of it that going back

4650
03:06:59,175 --> 03:07:01,420
to experience things for the first time

4651
03:07:01,420 --> 03:07:03,090
only happens the first time.

4652
03:07:03,090 --> 03:07:04,380
You can't do it again.

4653
03:07:04,380 --> 03:07:07,410
I don't know if I have it in me

4654
03:07:07,410 --> 03:07:09,177
to go through the of the early days again.

4655
03:07:09,177 --> 03:07:12,013
And I say bullshit in the sense of the most endearing sense.

4656
03:07:12,013 --> 03:07:13,740
It's all great to do it.

4657
03:07:13,740 --> 03:07:15,252
I know too much.

4658
03:07:15,252 --> 03:07:16,980
This is one of the reasons why,

4659
03:07:16,980 --> 03:07:18,060
whenever I'm asked the questions,

4660
03:07:18,060 --> 03:07:20,127
if you could tell your younger self

4661
03:07:20,127 --> 03:07:21,990
something that would really,

4662
03:07:21,990 --> 03:07:23,340
what would you say to your younger self?

4663
03:07:23,340 --> 03:07:25,050
I would fuck not say a thing.

4664
03:07:25,050 --> 03:07:26,580
I would not rob my younger self

4665
03:07:26,580 --> 03:07:29,421
of all the life experiences that I've been blessed

4666
03:07:29,421 --> 03:07:33,120
with due to the ignorance of how the world works.

4667
03:07:33,120 --> 03:07:38,120
Building up the wisdom about how the world works is a joy.

4668
03:07:38,580 --> 03:07:39,990
And you gotta build it one break at a time

4669
03:07:39,990 --> 03:07:42,000
if you just handed all the results.

4670
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:43,830
It's like, oh, should we watch your movie?

4671
03:07:43,830 --> 03:07:45,150
Here's how it ends.

4672
03:07:45,150 --> 03:07:46,920
I don't wanna fucking watch the movie now.

4673
03:07:46,920 --> 03:07:48,510
You spoiled it.

4674
03:07:48,510 --> 03:07:51,420
I don't want you to spoil my business experience.

4675
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:53,820
I don't wanna spoil any of my ignorance.

4676
03:07:53,820 --> 03:07:55,800
The greatest blessing half the time

4677
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:57,270
when you're starting something new is A,

4678
03:07:57,270 --> 03:07:59,160
you don't know how hard it's gonna be;

4679
03:07:59,160 --> 03:08:01,653
B, you don't know what you don't know.

4680
03:08:01,653 --> 03:08:04,382
Like the adventure is to pay off,

4681
03:08:04,382 --> 03:08:06,870
the responsibility is to pay off.

4682
03:08:06,870 --> 03:08:08,040
This is something Jordan Peterson

4683
03:08:08,040 --> 03:08:10,001
has really taught me to articulate.

4684
03:08:10,001 --> 03:08:13,743
This notion that responsibility is actually key to me.

4685
03:08:16,627 --> 03:08:17,820
"Man's Search for Meaning,"

4686
03:08:17,820 --> 03:08:19,890
Viktor Frankl talks about this as well,

4687
03:08:19,890 --> 03:08:24,720
that we can endure any hardship if there's a reason why.

4688
03:08:24,720 --> 03:08:28,121
Now he talked about it in truly life altering

4689
03:08:28,121 --> 03:08:30,120
concentration can't waste.

4690
03:08:30,120 --> 03:08:32,250
But you can also apply at a smaller scale

4691
03:08:32,250 --> 03:08:33,734
with less criticality

4692
03:08:33,734 --> 03:08:35,760
of even just your daily life

4693
03:08:35,760 --> 03:08:39,240
that all that hardship in building the original business

4694
03:08:39,240 --> 03:08:40,740
that is responsibility

4695
03:08:40,740 --> 03:08:42,711
you take upon yourself the appeal.

4696
03:08:42,711 --> 03:08:44,880
The reason you take that on you

4697
03:08:44,880 --> 03:08:47,010
is in part because you don't know fully what it entails.

4698
03:08:47,010 --> 03:08:48,990
If you had known upfront, if I had known upfront,

4699
03:08:48,990 --> 03:08:50,370
how hard it would be?

4700
03:08:50,370 --> 03:08:53,850
How much frustration there'd be along the way?

4701
03:08:53,850 --> 03:08:55,860
If you just told me that in a narrative

4702
03:08:55,860 --> 03:08:58,410
before I got started, I would've been like, eh,

4703
03:08:58,410 --> 03:09:00,600
maybe I should just go get a job.

4704
03:09:00,600 --> 03:09:02,086
- You said so many smart things there.

4705
03:09:02,086 --> 03:09:04,380
Just to pick one.

4706
03:09:04,380 --> 03:09:08,302
It's funny that sometimes the advice givers,

4707
03:09:08,302 --> 03:09:13,302
the wisdom givers have gone through all the bullshit.

4708
03:09:13,842 --> 03:09:15,690
And so there is a degree

4709
03:09:15,690 --> 03:09:17,250
to which you wanna make the mistake.

4710
03:09:17,250 --> 03:09:21,000
So I think I would still give the advice of you

4711
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,017
want to have a stretch of your life

4712
03:09:23,017 --> 03:09:27,765
where you work too hard, including a thing that fails.

4713
03:09:27,765 --> 03:09:29,970
I don't think you can learn the lessons

4714
03:09:29,970 --> 03:09:34,320
why that's a bad idea in any other way except by doing it.

4715
03:09:34,320 --> 03:09:36,990
There is a degree like, but of course you don't.

4716
03:09:36,990 --> 03:09:38,460
- I think you should stretch.

4717
03:09:38,460 --> 03:09:40,200
Should you have to stretch for a decade?

4718
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:41,033
I'm not so sure.

4719
03:09:41,033 --> 03:09:43,533
- Yeah, the decade thing is 20s is a special time.

4720
03:09:43,533 --> 03:09:45,000
- It's a lot to trade.

4721
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:46,150
You don't get your 20s back.

4722
03:09:46,150 --> 03:09:47,490
Yeah, you don't get your 30s back.

4723
03:09:47,490 --> 03:09:48,720
You don't get your 40s back.

4724
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:52,290
You really, I would've regretted personally

4725
03:09:52,290 --> 03:09:54,930
if I hadn't done the other things I did in my 20s,

4726
03:09:54,930 --> 03:09:56,370
if I hadn't had the fun I had,

4727
03:09:56,370 --> 03:09:57,750
if I hadn't had the friends I had,

4728
03:09:57,750 --> 03:09:59,850
if I hadn't built up the hobbies that I did,

4729
03:09:59,850 --> 03:10:02,400
if I hadn't started driving race cars

4730
03:10:02,400 --> 03:10:05,220
at an early enough age to actually get really good at it,

4731
03:10:05,220 --> 03:10:07,664
if I had just gone all in on business

4732
03:10:07,664 --> 03:10:10,410
because I would've got the same out in the end.

4733
03:10:10,410 --> 03:10:13,050
This is something Derek Sivers really taught me

4734
03:10:13,050 --> 03:10:15,000
is he has this great essay

4735
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,902
about how when he went for a bike ride,

4736
03:10:17,902 --> 03:10:20,460
he could go really hard all out

4737
03:10:20,460 --> 03:10:24,690
and he could do the ride I think in whatever 19 minutes.

4738
03:10:24,690 --> 03:10:27,540
Or he could enjoy the ride, go 5% slower,

4739
03:10:27,540 --> 03:10:29,599
do the ride in 21 minutes

4740
03:10:29,599 --> 03:10:32,850
and realize there's only two minutes apart.

4741
03:10:32,850 --> 03:10:35,520
Either I go all in all the time, there's nothing else,

4742
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:37,686
I'm completely exhausted at the alt.

4743
03:10:37,686 --> 03:10:40,200
Or I travel the same distance

4744
03:10:40,200 --> 03:10:42,225
and I arrive maybe two minutes later,

4745
03:10:42,225 --> 03:10:44,370
but I got to enjoy the scenery,

4746
03:10:44,370 --> 03:10:46,748
listen to the birds, smell the flowers.

4747
03:10:46,748 --> 03:10:50,108
That journey is also valuable.

4748
03:10:50,108 --> 03:10:54,481
Now I say that while accepting and celebrating

4749
03:10:54,481 --> 03:10:58,076
that if you wanna be the best at one thing in the world,

4750
03:10:58,076 --> 03:11:00,360
no, you have to sacrifice everything.

4751
03:11:00,360 --> 03:11:03,450
You have to be obsessed with just that thing.

4752
03:11:03,450 --> 03:11:04,710
There is no instant

4753
03:11:04,710 --> 03:11:07,080
of someone who's the best in the world at something

4754
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:08,970
who's not completely obsessed at.

4755
03:11:08,970 --> 03:11:10,860
I didn't need to be the best at anything.

4756
03:11:10,860 --> 03:11:14,610
This was a rare blessing of humility

4757
03:11:14,610 --> 03:11:16,620
I had early on is like, do you know what?

4758
03:11:16,620 --> 03:11:17,910
I am not that smart.

4759
03:11:17,910 --> 03:11:18,780
I'm not that good.

4760
03:11:18,780 --> 03:11:20,040
I'm not that talented.

4761
03:11:20,040 --> 03:11:21,600
I can do interesting things

4762
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:24,838
by combining different aspects and elements that I know,

4763
03:11:24,838 --> 03:11:26,869
but I'm not gonna be the best at anything.

4764
03:11:26,869 --> 03:11:31,236
And that released me from this singular obsession

4765
03:11:31,236 --> 03:11:32,220
with just going,

4766
03:11:32,220 --> 03:11:34,260
I'm gonna be the best programmer in the world.

4767
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:35,353
Eh, I know I'm not.

4768
03:11:35,353 --> 03:11:36,709
I failed at it twice

4769
03:11:36,709 --> 03:11:39,432
before I even got how conditional it's worked.

4770
03:11:39,432 --> 03:11:42,090
I'm not smart enough to be the best at anything.

4771
03:11:42,090 --> 03:11:44,490
I'm not dedicated enough to do that.

4772
03:11:44,490 --> 03:11:46,350
That's a bit of a blessing.

4773
03:11:46,350 --> 03:11:49,770
And I think as a society, we have to straddle

4774
03:11:49,770 --> 03:11:52,050
both celebrating peak excellence,

4775
03:11:52,050 --> 03:11:53,670
which we do all the time

4776
03:11:53,670 --> 03:11:56,012
and celebrating the peak intensity

4777
03:11:56,012 --> 03:11:58,410
of mission it takes to become that.

4778
03:11:58,410 --> 03:12:00,368
And then also going like, do you know what?

4779
03:12:00,368 --> 03:12:03,480
We don't all need to be Michael Jordan.

4780
03:12:03,480 --> 03:12:04,770
There's only gonna be one of those.

4781
03:12:04,770 --> 03:12:07,020
- Well, we should say that there's certain pursuits

4782
03:12:07,020 --> 03:12:10,663
where a singular obsession is required.

4783
03:12:10,663 --> 03:12:12,540
Basketball is one of them.

4784
03:12:12,540 --> 03:12:14,580
By the way, probably racing.

4785
03:12:14,580 --> 03:12:17,310
If you wanna be the best at F1 in the world...

4786
03:12:17,310 --> 03:12:19,801
- If you wanna be Senna, you gotta be a maniac.

4787
03:12:19,801 --> 03:12:21,480
- But I would argue

4788
03:12:21,480 --> 03:12:24,813
that there's most disciplines like programming

4789
03:12:24,813 --> 03:12:27,630
allows if you want to be, quote, unquote, "the best,"

4790
03:12:27,630 --> 03:12:29,190
whatever that means,

4791
03:12:29,190 --> 03:12:31,710
I think that's judged at the end of your life.

4792
03:12:31,710 --> 03:12:33,870
And usually if you look at that path,

4793
03:12:33,870 --> 03:12:35,610
it's gonna be an nonlinear one.

4794
03:12:35,610 --> 03:12:37,250
It you're not gonna look like the life

4795
03:12:37,250 --> 03:12:39,633
of an Olympic athlete who's singular focus.

4796
03:12:40,500 --> 03:12:43,800
There's gonna be some acid there in the 20s

4797
03:12:43,800 --> 03:12:48,108
or there's going to be a several detours,

4798
03:12:48,108 --> 03:12:50,436
which the true greats.

4799
03:12:50,436 --> 03:12:51,960
There's gonna be detours.

4800
03:12:51,960 --> 03:12:53,760
And sometimes they're not gonna be

4801
03:12:53,760 --> 03:12:55,950
Steve Jobs asset type of situation.

4802
03:12:55,950 --> 03:12:58,050
There'll be just different companies

4803
03:12:58,050 --> 03:12:59,790
you've worked for different careers

4804
03:12:59,790 --> 03:13:04,320
or different sort of efforts

4805
03:13:04,320 --> 03:13:06,870
you allocated your life to.

4806
03:13:06,870 --> 03:13:08,370
But it's gonna be non-linear.

4807
03:13:08,370 --> 03:13:09,630
It's not gonna be a singular focus.

4808
03:13:09,630 --> 03:13:11,340
- The way I think about this sometimes

4809
03:13:11,340 --> 03:13:14,910
is I want a good bargain on learning.

4810
03:13:14,910 --> 03:13:18,258
I can become in the top 5%

4811
03:13:18,258 --> 03:13:21,010
of whatever I defined as good at something

4812
03:13:21,947 --> 03:13:23,850
much, much easier.

4813
03:13:23,850 --> 03:13:25,517
Perhaps it's 20 times easier, 100 times easier

4814
03:13:25,517 --> 03:13:30,270
to get into the top 5% than it is to get into the top 0.1%.

4815
03:13:30,270 --> 03:13:32,340
That's almost impossibly hard to get into that.

4816
03:13:32,340 --> 03:13:35,580
But if I'm content just being in the top 5%,

4817
03:13:35,580 --> 03:13:38,284
I can be in the top 5% on like five things at once.

4818
03:13:38,284 --> 03:13:41,100
I can get really good at writing.

4819
03:13:41,100 --> 03:13:43,740
I can get decent at driving a race car.

4820
03:13:43,740 --> 03:13:46,080
I can become pretty good at programming.

4821
03:13:46,080 --> 03:13:47,100
I can run a company.

4822
03:13:47,100 --> 03:13:48,420
I can have a family.

4823
03:13:48,420 --> 03:13:50,910
I can do a lot of things at the same time.

4824
03:13:50,910 --> 03:13:53,460
That gives me sort of that variety

4825
03:13:53,460 --> 03:13:57,157
that almost was idealized Karl Marx has this idea,

4826
03:13:57,157 --> 03:13:59,070
"Oh, I'm gonna fish in the morning

4827
03:13:59,070 --> 03:14:00,990
and hammer in the evening

4828
03:14:00,990 --> 03:14:02,853
and paint on the weekends, right?"

4829
03:14:02,853 --> 03:14:05,340
That there's a sense for me at least

4830
03:14:05,340 --> 03:14:08,100
where his diagnosis of alienation was true.

4831
03:14:08,100 --> 03:14:09,660
That just that tunnel vision.

4832
03:14:09,660 --> 03:14:12,120
There's just this one thing I'm just gonna focus on that

4833
03:14:12,120 --> 03:14:14,940
gives me a sense of alienation I can't stomach.

4834
03:14:14,940 --> 03:14:16,710
When I'm really deep on programming

4835
03:14:16,710 --> 03:14:18,924
and sometimes I go deep for weeks,

4836
03:14:18,924 --> 03:14:21,360
maybe even in a few cases months,

4837
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:23,760
I have to come up for air

4838
03:14:23,760 --> 03:14:25,290
and I have to go do something else.

4839
03:14:25,290 --> 03:14:27,690
Like, all right, that was programming for this year.

4840
03:14:27,690 --> 03:14:30,210
I've done my part and I'm gonna go off riding

4841
03:14:30,210 --> 03:14:31,620
or annoy people on the internet

4842
03:14:31,620 --> 03:14:33,990
or drive some race cars to do something else.

4843
03:14:33,990 --> 03:14:36,420
And then I can do the programming thing

4844
03:14:36,420 --> 03:14:38,280
with full intensity again next year.

4845
03:14:38,280 --> 03:14:40,530
- Speaking of annoying people on the internet,

4846
03:14:40,530 --> 03:14:41,860
you gotta explain to me this drama.

4847
03:14:41,860 --> 03:14:44,100
Okay, so what is this guy that said,

4848
03:14:44,100 --> 03:14:46,538
imagine losing to Jira but boasting

4849
03:14:46,538 --> 03:14:49,770
that you have a couple million dollars per year.

4850
03:14:49,770 --> 03:14:54,120
So this had to do with this almost now a meme decision

4851
03:14:54,120 --> 03:14:55,290
to leave the cloud.

4852
03:14:55,290 --> 03:14:57,934
DHH left the cloud.

4853
03:14:57,934 --> 03:15:00,210
I think that's literally a meme,

4854
03:15:00,210 --> 03:15:03,780
but it's also a fascinating decision.

4855
03:15:03,780 --> 03:15:06,630
Can you talk through the full saga of DHH

4856
03:15:06,630 --> 03:15:07,920
leaves the cloud?

4857
03:15:07,920 --> 03:15:11,697
- Yes. - Of leaving AWS saving money.

4858
03:15:11,697 --> 03:15:14,550
And I guess the case this person is making now.

4859
03:15:14,550 --> 03:15:17,130
- Is that we wasted our time optimizing a business

4860
03:15:17,130 --> 03:15:18,690
that could've been a hundred times bigger

4861
03:15:18,690 --> 03:15:20,430
if we'd just gone for the moon.

4862
03:15:20,430 --> 03:15:22,650
- And for the moon includes?

4863
03:15:22,650 --> 03:15:24,180
- Venture capital. - But also...

4864
03:15:24,180 --> 03:15:26,820
- And other things in not caring about cost.

4865
03:15:26,820 --> 03:15:29,283
- But also because AGIs are on the corner,

4866
03:15:29,283 --> 03:15:31,860
you should have been investing into AI, right?

4867
03:15:31,860 --> 03:15:33,840
Is this just part of? - Sort of tank ginger?

4868
03:15:33,840 --> 03:15:35,250
I think it's a bit of a muddy argument,

4869
03:15:35,250 --> 03:15:38,885
but if we just take it at it's peak ideal,

4870
03:15:38,885 --> 03:15:41,567
which I actually think is a reasonable point,

4871
03:15:41,567 --> 03:15:46,567
is that you can get myopically focused on counting pennies

4872
03:15:47,100 --> 03:15:49,815
when you should be focused on getting, right?

4873
03:15:49,815 --> 03:15:54,815
That I've optimized our spend on infrastructure

4874
03:15:54,996 --> 03:15:56,610
by getting out of the cloud

4875
03:15:56,610 --> 03:15:59,160
and that took some time and I could have taken that time

4876
03:15:59,160 --> 03:16:01,395
and spend it on making more features

4877
03:16:01,395 --> 03:16:03,900
that would've attract more customers

4878
03:16:03,900 --> 03:16:06,360
or spend even more time with AI or done other things.

4879
03:16:06,360 --> 03:16:07,950
Opportunity cost is real.

4880
03:16:07,950 --> 03:16:09,175
I'm not denying that.

4881
03:16:09,175 --> 03:16:14,175
I'm pushing back on the idea that for a company of our size

4882
03:16:14,749 --> 03:16:19,590
saving $2 million a year on our infrastructure bill,

4883
03:16:19,590 --> 03:16:22,937
which is about somewhere between half to two thirds

4884
03:16:22,937 --> 03:16:25,110
goes directly to the bottom line,

4885
03:16:25,110 --> 03:16:27,630
which means it's return to Jason or I as owners

4886
03:16:27,630 --> 03:16:32,520
and our employees part of our profit sharing plan,

4887
03:16:32,520 --> 03:16:34,374
is totally worth doing.

4888
03:16:34,374 --> 03:16:37,140
This idea that costs don't matter

4889
03:16:37,140 --> 03:16:39,750
is a very Silicon Valley way of thinking

4890
03:16:39,750 --> 03:16:43,680
that again, understand at the scale of something maybe,

4891
03:16:43,680 --> 03:16:48,680
but I also actually think it's aesthetically unpleasing.

4892
03:16:49,691 --> 03:16:52,110
I find an inefficient business

4893
03:16:52,110 --> 03:16:56,190
as I find an inefficient program full of line noise

4894
03:16:56,190 --> 03:16:58,862
to just be a splinter in my brain.

4895
03:16:58,862 --> 03:17:01,620
I hate looking at an expense report

4896
03:17:01,620 --> 03:17:04,537
and just seeing disproportionate waste.

4897
03:17:04,537 --> 03:17:06,810
And when I was looking at our spend

4898
03:17:06,810 --> 03:17:09,713
at 37signals a while back, a few years back,

4899
03:17:09,713 --> 03:17:13,830
I saw bills that did not pass my smell test.

4900
03:17:13,830 --> 03:17:16,080
I remembered how much we used to spend

4901
03:17:16,080 --> 03:17:18,270
on infrastructure before the cloud

4902
03:17:18,270 --> 03:17:20,520
and I saw numbers I could not recognize

4903
03:17:20,520 --> 03:17:22,199
in proportion to what we needed.

4904
03:17:22,199 --> 03:17:24,960
The fact that computers had gotten so much faster over time,

4905
03:17:24,960 --> 03:17:26,910
shouldn't things be getting cheaper?

4906
03:17:26,910 --> 03:17:29,010
Why are we spending more and more money

4907
03:17:29,010 --> 03:17:30,510
servicing more customers?

4908
03:17:30,510 --> 03:17:33,120
Yes, but with much faster computers,

4909
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:36,528
Moore's Law should be lowering the costs

4910
03:17:36,528 --> 03:17:38,190
and the opposite is happening.

4911
03:17:38,190 --> 03:17:39,630
Why is that happening?

4912
03:17:39,630 --> 03:17:43,290
And that started a journey of unwinding

4913
03:17:43,290 --> 03:17:47,400
why the cloud isn't as great as the deal

4914
03:17:47,400 --> 03:17:48,720
as people like to think that.

4915
03:17:48,720 --> 03:17:51,240
- Yeah, can we look at the specifics

4916
03:17:51,240 --> 03:17:53,010
just for people who don't know the story

4917
03:17:53,010 --> 03:17:57,090
and then generalize to what it means about

4918
03:17:57,090 --> 03:17:59,610
the role of the cloud and the tech business.

4919
03:17:59,610 --> 03:18:03,503
So the specifics is you were using AWS S3 for...

4920
03:18:03,503 --> 03:18:05,730
- We were using AWS for everything.

4921
03:18:05,730 --> 03:18:08,554
HEY.com launched as an entirely cloud app.

4922
03:18:08,554 --> 03:18:10,975
It was completely on AWS for compute,

4923
03:18:10,975 --> 03:18:13,260
for databases, for all of it.

4924
03:18:13,260 --> 03:18:15,000
We were using all the systems

4925
03:18:15,000 --> 03:18:17,460
as they're best prescribed that we should.

4926
03:18:17,460 --> 03:18:20,846
Our total cloud bill for Basecamp,

4927
03:18:20,846 --> 03:18:25,710
our total spend with AWS was I think 3.2 million

4928
03:18:25,710 --> 03:18:28,230
or 3.4 million at its peak.

4929
03:18:28,230 --> 03:18:29,850
That's kind of a lot of money.

4930
03:18:29,850 --> 03:18:33,456
3.4 million, I mean we have a ton of users and customers,

4931
03:18:33,456 --> 03:18:36,913
but still that just struck me as unreasonable.

4932
03:18:36,913 --> 03:18:39,035
And the reason why it was so unreasonable

4933
03:18:39,035 --> 03:18:42,450
was because I had the pitch for the cloud

4934
03:18:42,450 --> 03:18:43,440
ringing in my ears.

4935
03:18:43,440 --> 03:18:45,339
Hey, this is gonna be faster.

4936
03:18:45,339 --> 03:18:47,220
This is gonna be easier.

4937
03:18:47,220 --> 03:18:48,496
This is gonna be cheaper.

4938
03:18:48,496 --> 03:18:51,360
Why are you trying to produce your own power, right?

4939
03:18:51,360 --> 03:18:52,387
Like, do you have your own power plant?

4940
03:18:52,387 --> 03:18:53,400
Why would you do that?

4941
03:18:53,400 --> 03:18:56,363
Leave the computers to the hyperscalers.

4942
03:18:56,363 --> 03:18:58,680
They're much better at it anyway.

4943
03:18:58,680 --> 03:19:00,690
I actually thought that was a compelling pitch.

4944
03:19:00,690 --> 03:19:03,090
I bought in on that pitch for several years

4945
03:19:03,090 --> 03:19:04,380
and thought, do you know what?

4946
03:19:04,380 --> 03:19:06,557
I'm done ever owning a server again.

4947
03:19:06,557 --> 03:19:08,640
We are just gonna render our capacity

4948
03:19:08,640 --> 03:19:12,051
and Amazon is gonna be able to offer us services

4949
03:19:12,051 --> 03:19:15,225
much cheaper than we could buy 'em themselves

4950
03:19:15,225 --> 03:19:17,230
because they're gonna have these economies of scale.

4951
03:19:17,230 --> 03:19:20,910
And I was thinking Jeff's word ringing.

4952
03:19:20,910 --> 03:19:23,739
My competitors margin is my opportunity.

4953
03:19:23,739 --> 03:19:26,726
That was something he used to drive amazon.com with.

4954
03:19:26,726 --> 03:19:29,340
That if he could just make 2%

4955
03:19:29,340 --> 03:19:30,930
when the other guy was trying to make 4%,

4956
03:19:30,930 --> 03:19:31,767
he would end up with all the money.

4957
03:19:31,767 --> 03:19:34,405
And on volume, he would still win.

4958
03:19:34,405 --> 03:19:38,010
So I thought that was the operating ethos for AWS.

4959
03:19:38,010 --> 03:19:39,421
It turns out that's not true at all.

4960
03:19:39,421 --> 03:19:42,965
AWS by the way operates its almost 40% margin.

4961
03:19:42,965 --> 03:19:45,755
So just in that, there's a clue

4962
03:19:45,755 --> 03:19:49,568
that competitors are not able to do the competitive thing

4963
03:19:49,568 --> 03:19:51,750
we like about capitalism,

4964
03:19:51,750 --> 03:19:53,885
which is to lower costs and so forth.

4965
03:19:53,885 --> 03:19:57,357
So the cloud pitch in my optics,

4966
03:19:57,357 --> 03:19:59,347
it's fundamentally false.

4967
03:19:59,347 --> 03:20:02,003
It did not get easier first of all.

4968
03:20:02,003 --> 03:20:04,410
I dunno if you've used AWS recently,

4969
03:20:04,410 --> 03:20:06,270
it is hella complicated.

4970
03:20:06,270 --> 03:20:07,800
If you think Linux is hard,

4971
03:20:07,800 --> 03:20:10,050
you've never tried to set up IAM rules

4972
03:20:10,050 --> 03:20:11,997
or access parameters or whatever for AWS.

4973
03:20:11,997 --> 03:20:14,070
- AWS is always difficult.

4974
03:20:14,070 --> 03:20:15,039
It was always complicated.

4975
03:20:15,039 --> 03:20:16,260
- Well, I think it's gotten even more difficult.

4976
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:19,170
But yes, now some of that is it's difficult

4977
03:20:19,170 --> 03:20:20,340
because it's very capable

4978
03:20:20,340 --> 03:20:21,909
and you have a bunch of capacity on tap.

4979
03:20:21,909 --> 03:20:25,045
And there are reasons I don't think they're good enough

4980
03:20:25,045 --> 03:20:26,910
to justify how complicated

4981
03:20:26,910 --> 03:20:29,550
the whole jing-a-ma-jing has become.

4982
03:20:29,550 --> 03:20:32,640
But what's certainly true is that it's no longer easier.

4983
03:20:32,640 --> 03:20:34,893
It's not easier to use AWS

4984
03:20:34,893 --> 03:20:37,230
than it is to run your own machines,

4985
03:20:37,230 --> 03:20:39,240
which we learned when we pulled out the cloud

4986
03:20:39,240 --> 03:20:40,977
and didn't hire a single extra person.

4987
03:20:40,977 --> 03:20:43,140
Even though we operate all our own hardware,

4988
03:20:43,140 --> 03:20:45,570
the team stayed exactly the same.

4989
03:20:45,570 --> 03:20:47,195
So you have this three-way pitch, right?

4990
03:20:47,195 --> 03:20:49,185
It's gonna be easier,

4991
03:20:49,185 --> 03:20:51,390
it's gonna be cheaper.

4992
03:20:51,390 --> 03:20:52,830
Certainly wasn't cheaper.

4993
03:20:52,830 --> 03:20:53,730
We've just proved that

4994
03:20:53,730 --> 03:20:55,830
by cutting our spend on infrastructure

4995
03:20:55,830 --> 03:20:57,720
by half to two thirds.

4996
03:20:57,720 --> 03:20:58,920
And it's gonna be faster.

4997
03:20:58,920 --> 03:21:00,305
The last bit was true,

4998
03:21:00,305 --> 03:21:03,570
but way too many people overestimated

4999
03:21:03,570 --> 03:21:05,340
the value of that speed.

5000
03:21:05,340 --> 03:21:09,000
If you need a thousand computers online

5001
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:11,220
in the next 15 minutes, nothing beats the cloud.

5002
03:21:11,220 --> 03:21:13,230
How would you even procure that?

5003
03:21:13,230 --> 03:21:15,660
If we just need another 20 servers,

5004
03:21:15,660 --> 03:21:17,155
it's gonna take a week or two

5005
03:21:17,155 --> 03:21:19,470
to get boxes shipped on pallets

5006
03:21:19,470 --> 03:21:22,200
delivered to a data center and unwrapped and racked,

5007
03:21:22,200 --> 03:21:23,454
and all that stuff, right?

5008
03:21:23,454 --> 03:21:25,431
But how often do we need to do that?

5009
03:21:25,431 --> 03:21:27,240
And how often do we need to do that

5010
03:21:27,240 --> 03:21:30,050
if buying those servers is way, way cheaper

5011
03:21:30,050 --> 03:21:31,920
so we get vastly more compute

5012
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:33,000
for the same amount of money.

5013
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:34,890
Could we just buy more servers

5014
03:21:34,890 --> 03:21:36,480
and not even care about the fact

5015
03:21:36,480 --> 03:21:39,390
that we're not hyper optimized on the compute utility?

5016
03:21:39,390 --> 03:21:42,638
That we don't have to use things like automatic scaling

5017
03:21:42,638 --> 03:21:45,360
to figure things out because we have to reduce costs?

5018
03:21:45,360 --> 03:21:46,590
Yes, we can.

5019
03:21:46,590 --> 03:21:51,360
So we went through this journey over a realization

5020
03:21:51,360 --> 03:21:53,907
in early 2023

5021
03:21:53,907 --> 03:21:57,780
when I had finally had enough with our bills.

5022
03:21:57,780 --> 03:21:59,880
I wanted to get rid of them. I wanted to spend less money.

5023
03:21:59,880 --> 03:22:02,100
I wanted to keep more of the money ourselves.

5024
03:22:02,100 --> 03:22:04,350
And in just over six months,

5025
03:22:04,350 --> 03:22:07,005
we moved seven major applications out of the cloud

5026
03:22:07,005 --> 03:22:10,080
in terms of compute caching databases

5027
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:11,760
to works onto our own servers.

5028
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:15,390
A glorious, beautiful new fleet bought

5029
03:22:15,390 --> 03:22:18,210
from the king of servers, Michael Dell,

5030
03:22:18,210 --> 03:22:20,846
who really, by the way, is another icon

5031
03:22:20,846 --> 03:22:23,880
on my, I saw he just celebrated 41 years in business.

5032
03:22:23,880 --> 03:22:28,710
41 years this man has been selling awesome servers

5033
03:22:28,710 --> 03:22:30,450
that we've been using for our entire existence.

5034
03:22:30,450 --> 03:22:34,123
But anyway, these pallets arrive in a couple of weeks

5035
03:22:34,123 --> 03:22:36,120
and we rack 'em up and get everything going.

5036
03:22:36,120 --> 03:22:37,830
And we were out.

5037
03:22:37,830 --> 03:22:39,180
At least with the compute part.

5038
03:22:39,180 --> 03:22:43,950
We then had a long multi-year commitment to S3

5039
03:22:43,950 --> 03:22:45,870
because the only way to get decent pricing

5040
03:22:45,870 --> 03:22:47,340
in the cloud, by the way,

5041
03:22:47,340 --> 03:22:50,580
is not to buy on a day-to-day basis,

5042
03:22:50,580 --> 03:22:52,140
not to rent on a database basis,

5043
03:22:52,140 --> 03:22:55,800
but to bind yourself up to multi-year contracts

5044
03:22:55,800 --> 03:22:57,660
with computes often a year.

5045
03:22:57,660 --> 03:23:00,812
That was in our case and with storage is was four years.

5046
03:23:00,812 --> 03:23:03,300
We signed a four-year contract

5047
03:23:03,300 --> 03:23:06,664
to store our petabytes of customer files in the cloud,

5048
03:23:06,664 --> 03:23:09,528
to be able to get something just halfway decent affordable.

5049
03:23:09,528 --> 03:23:12,800
So all of these projects came together to the sense

5050
03:23:12,800 --> 03:23:16,380
that we're now saving literally millions of dollars,

5051
03:23:16,380 --> 03:23:19,230
projected about 10 million over five years.

5052
03:23:19,230 --> 03:23:20,063
It's always hard.

5053
03:23:20,063 --> 03:23:21,780
How do you do the accounting exactly,

5054
03:23:21,780 --> 03:23:23,910
and TOC this, that and the other thing.

5055
03:23:23,910 --> 03:23:25,510
But it's millions of dollars.

5056
03:23:25,510 --> 03:23:27,450
But it's not just that.

5057
03:23:27,450 --> 03:23:30,261
It's also the fact that getting out of the cloud

5058
03:23:30,261 --> 03:23:35,261
meant returning to more of an original idea of the internet.

5059
03:23:35,340 --> 03:23:37,390
That the internet was not the sign

5060
03:23:37,390 --> 03:23:40,227
such that three computers should run everything.

5061
03:23:40,227 --> 03:23:42,090
It was a distributed network

5062
03:23:42,090 --> 03:23:43,440
such that the individual nodes

5063
03:23:43,440 --> 03:23:46,080
could disappear and the whole thing would still carry on.

5064
03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:48,720
DARPA had designed this such that the Russians

5065
03:23:48,720 --> 03:23:50,310
could take out Washington

5066
03:23:50,310 --> 03:23:52,290
and they could still fight back from New York,

5067
03:23:52,290 --> 03:23:54,240
that the entire communication infrastructure

5068
03:23:54,240 --> 03:23:57,063
wouldn't disappear because there was no hub and spoke.

5069
03:23:57,063 --> 03:23:58,560
It was a network.

5070
03:23:58,560 --> 03:24:01,789
I always found that an immensely beautiful vision.

5071
03:24:01,789 --> 03:24:04,710
That you could have this glorious internet

5072
03:24:04,710 --> 03:24:07,350
and no single node was in control of everything.

5073
03:24:07,350 --> 03:24:10,770
And we've returned to much more of a single

5074
03:24:10,770 --> 03:24:12,162
node controlling everything

5075
03:24:12,162 --> 03:24:14,610
idea with these hyperscalers.

5076
03:24:14,610 --> 03:24:18,390
When US-East-1, the main and original region

5077
03:24:18,390 --> 03:24:20,020
for AWS goes offline,

5078
03:24:20,020 --> 03:24:22,710
which has happened more than a few times over the years.

5079
03:24:22,710 --> 03:24:25,380
Seemingly a third of the internet is offline.

5080
03:24:25,380 --> 03:24:28,666
Like that in itself is just an insult to DARPA's design.

5081
03:24:28,666 --> 03:24:30,870
It just detract from the fact

5082
03:24:30,870 --> 03:24:33,180
that what AWS built was marvelous.

5083
03:24:33,180 --> 03:24:37,410
I think the cloud has moved so many things so far forward,

5084
03:24:37,410 --> 03:24:40,800
especially around virtualization, automation setup.

5085
03:24:40,800 --> 03:24:45,630
It's all those giant forward for system administration

5086
03:24:45,630 --> 03:24:47,310
that's allowing us now

5087
03:24:47,310 --> 03:24:49,680
to be able to run things on-prem in a way

5088
03:24:49,680 --> 03:24:53,037
that smells and feels much like the cloud

5089
03:24:53,037 --> 03:24:55,200
just at half the cost or less,

5090
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:56,460
and with the autonomy

5091
03:24:56,460 --> 03:24:59,350
and the satisfaction of owning hardware.

5092
03:24:59,350 --> 03:25:01,474
I don't know what the last time you looked at

5093
03:25:01,474 --> 03:25:03,215
like an actual server and took it apart

5094
03:25:03,215 --> 03:25:04,590
and looked inside of it.

5095
03:25:04,590 --> 03:25:06,450
These things are gorgeous.

5096
03:25:06,450 --> 03:25:08,220
I mean, I posted a couple of pictures

5097
03:25:08,220 --> 03:25:10,320
of our racks out in the data center

5098
03:25:10,320 --> 03:25:11,730
and people always go crazy for 'em

5099
03:25:11,730 --> 03:25:13,800
because we've gotten so abstracted

5100
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:16,080
from what the underlying metal looks like

5101
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:17,804
in this cloud age that most people have no idea.

5102
03:25:17,804 --> 03:25:22,804
They've no idea how powerful a modern CPU is.

5103
03:25:23,100 --> 03:25:24,408
They have no idea

5104
03:25:24,408 --> 03:25:28,867
how much RAM you can fit into a one U rack.

5105
03:25:28,867 --> 03:25:32,760
Progress in computing has been really exciting,

5106
03:25:32,760 --> 03:25:35,160
especially I'd say in the last four to five years

5107
03:25:35,160 --> 03:25:38,820
after TSMC with Apple's help really pushed the envelope.

5108
03:25:38,820 --> 03:25:41,610
I mean, we kind of sat still there for a while

5109
03:25:41,610 --> 03:25:44,250
while Intel was spinning their wheels going nowhere.

5110
03:25:44,250 --> 03:25:47,100
And then TSMC with Apple propelling them

5111
03:25:47,100 --> 03:25:48,330
really moved things forward.

5112
03:25:48,330 --> 03:25:50,370
And now servers are exciting again.

5113
03:25:50,370 --> 03:25:54,450
Like you're getting jumps year over year and the 15, 20%

5114
03:25:54,450 --> 03:25:57,120
rather than the single digit we were stuck with for a while.

5115
03:25:57,120 --> 03:26:00,180
And that all means that owning your own hardware

5116
03:26:00,180 --> 03:26:02,910
is a more feasible proposition than it's ever been.

5117
03:26:02,910 --> 03:26:05,431
That you need fewer machines to run ever more

5118
03:26:05,431 --> 03:26:07,590
and that more people should do it.

5119
03:26:07,590 --> 03:26:12,180
Because as much as I love Jeff and Amazon,

5120
03:26:12,180 --> 03:26:14,940
like he doesn't need another whatever,

5121
03:26:14,940 --> 03:26:17,070
40% margin on all the tech stuff

5122
03:26:17,070 --> 03:26:19,255
that I buy to run our business.

5123
03:26:19,255 --> 03:26:23,040
And this is just something I've been focused on.

5124
03:26:23,040 --> 03:26:25,620
Both because of the ideology

5125
03:26:25,620 --> 03:26:28,427
around honoring DARPA's original design,

5126
03:26:28,427 --> 03:26:31,710
the practicality of running our own hardware,

5127
03:26:31,710 --> 03:26:34,140
seeing how fast we can push things

5128
03:26:34,140 --> 03:26:38,010
with the latest machines and then saving the money.

5129
03:26:38,010 --> 03:26:42,060
And that has all been so enjoyable to do,

5130
03:26:42,060 --> 03:26:44,040
but also so counterintuitive for a lot of people

5131
03:26:44,040 --> 03:26:44,910
because it seemed,

5132
03:26:44,910 --> 03:26:46,740
I think for a lot of people in the industry

5133
03:26:46,740 --> 03:26:48,120
that like we'd all decided

5134
03:26:48,120 --> 03:26:49,797
that we were done buying computers,

5135
03:26:49,797 --> 03:26:52,740
that that was something we would just delegate to AWS

5136
03:26:52,740 --> 03:26:55,650
and Azure and Google Cloud,

5137
03:26:55,650 --> 03:26:57,390
that we didn't have to own these things anymore.

5138
03:26:57,390 --> 03:26:59,490
So I think there's a little bit of whiplash

5139
03:26:59,490 --> 03:27:02,310
for some people that, "Oh, I thought we agreed.

5140
03:27:02,310 --> 03:27:03,180
We were done with that."

5141
03:27:03,180 --> 03:27:04,620
And then along come us

5142
03:27:04,620 --> 03:27:06,210
and say, "Ah, do you know what?

5143
03:27:06,210 --> 03:27:07,560
Maybe you should have a computer."

5144
03:27:07,560 --> 03:27:10,020
- Is there some pain points to running your own servers?

5145
03:27:10,020 --> 03:27:10,853
- Oh, plenty.

5146
03:27:10,853 --> 03:27:13,560
There's pain points to operating computers of all kind.

5147
03:27:13,560 --> 03:27:14,600
Have you tried just like

5148
03:27:14,600 --> 03:27:16,400
using a personal computer these days?

5149
03:27:16,400 --> 03:27:18,879
Half the time when my kids or my wife

5150
03:27:18,879 --> 03:27:20,520
have a problem, I go like,

5151
03:27:20,520 --> 03:27:22,260
have you tried turning it just off and on again.

5152
03:27:22,260 --> 03:27:25,194
Computers are inherently painful to humans.

5153
03:27:25,194 --> 03:27:27,330
Owning your own computer though

5154
03:27:27,330 --> 03:27:29,160
kind of makes some of that pain worth it.

5155
03:27:29,160 --> 03:27:30,600
There's a responsibility

5156
03:27:30,600 --> 03:27:33,900
that comes with actually owning the hardware that to me,

5157
03:27:33,900 --> 03:27:36,270
at least make the burden of operating

5158
03:27:36,270 --> 03:27:38,310
that hardware seem slightly more enjoyable.

5159
03:27:38,310 --> 03:27:41,252
Now there are things you have to learn,

5160
03:27:41,252 --> 03:27:42,870
certainly at our scale too.

5161
03:27:42,870 --> 03:27:44,460
I mean, we're not just buying a single computer

5162
03:27:44,460 --> 03:27:45,720
and plugging into an ethernet.

5163
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:47,160
We have to have racks and racks with them

5164
03:27:47,160 --> 03:27:48,720
and you gotta set it up with network cabling

5165
03:27:48,720 --> 03:27:51,156
and there is some specialized expertise in that,

5166
03:27:51,156 --> 03:27:53,530
but it's not like that expertise

5167
03:27:53,530 --> 03:27:56,340
is like building nuclear rockets.

5168
03:27:56,340 --> 03:27:58,620
It's not like it's not widely distributed.

5169
03:27:58,620 --> 03:28:00,420
Literally the entire internet

5170
03:28:00,420 --> 03:28:01,770
was built on people knowing

5171
03:28:01,770 --> 03:28:04,230
how to plug in a computer to the internet, right?

5172
03:28:04,230 --> 03:28:06,478
Oh, ethernet cable goes here, power cable goes here,

5173
03:28:06,478 --> 03:28:07,932
let's boot up Linux.

5174
03:28:07,932 --> 03:28:10,440
That's how everyone put anything online

5175
03:28:10,440 --> 03:28:13,230
until 10, 12 years ago

5176
03:28:13,230 --> 03:28:14,670
when the cloud sort of took over.

5177
03:28:14,670 --> 03:28:17,070
So the expertise is there and can be rediscovered.

5178
03:28:17,070 --> 03:28:20,073
You too can learn how to operate a Linux computer.

5179
03:28:21,030 --> 03:28:23,550
- Yeah, and it's, you know, when you get a bunch of them,

5180
03:28:23,550 --> 03:28:25,230
there's a bunch of flashing LEDs

5181
03:28:25,230 --> 03:28:26,700
and it's just so exciting. - Oh, they're beautiful,

5182
03:28:26,700 --> 03:28:28,380
calming, amazing.

5183
03:28:28,380 --> 03:28:29,610
Computers are really fun.

5184
03:28:29,610 --> 03:28:31,950
This is actually something I've gotten into even deeper

5185
03:28:31,950 --> 03:28:33,630
after we moved out of the cloud.

5186
03:28:33,630 --> 03:28:37,170
Now my next kind of tingle

5187
03:28:37,170 --> 03:28:39,600
is that if you could move out of the cloud,

5188
03:28:39,600 --> 03:28:41,846
can you also move out of the data center?

5189
03:28:41,846 --> 03:28:46,758
Personal servers have gotten really scarily

5190
03:28:46,758 --> 03:28:48,540
quick and efficient

5191
03:28:48,540 --> 03:28:50,911
and personal internet connections

5192
03:28:50,911 --> 03:28:54,540
rival what we connected data centers with

5193
03:28:54,540 --> 03:28:57,150
just a decade or two ago.

5194
03:28:57,150 --> 03:28:59,055
So there's a whole community

5195
03:28:59,055 --> 03:29:01,680
around this concept of home lapping,

5196
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:04,110
which is essentially installing server hardware

5197
03:29:04,110 --> 03:29:07,080
in your own apartment, connecting it to the internet,

5198
03:29:07,080 --> 03:29:09,605
and exposing that directly to the internet.

5199
03:29:09,605 --> 03:29:13,740
That harks back to those glorious days of the '90s

5200
03:29:13,740 --> 03:29:15,810
when people building for the internet

5201
03:29:15,810 --> 03:29:18,120
would host the actual website

5202
03:29:18,120 --> 03:29:20,430
on their actual computer in the closet.

5203
03:29:20,430 --> 03:29:22,380
And I'm pretty fired up about that.

5204
03:29:22,380 --> 03:29:23,460
I'm doing a bunch of experiments.

5205
03:29:23,460 --> 03:29:25,110
I've ordered a bunch of home servers

5206
03:29:25,110 --> 03:29:26,430
from my own apartment.

5207
03:29:26,430 --> 03:29:27,720
I marvel at the fact

5208
03:29:27,720 --> 03:29:30,840
that I can get a five gigabit, five connection now,

5209
03:29:30,840 --> 03:29:32,700
I think, do you know what five gigabit

5210
03:29:32,700 --> 03:29:34,170
that could have taken Basecamp

5211
03:29:34,170 --> 03:29:37,933
to multiple millions of MRR

5212
03:29:37,933 --> 03:29:40,560
in the way that back then,

5213
03:29:40,560 --> 03:29:42,870
I ran the whole business on a single box

5214
03:29:42,870 --> 03:29:47,870
with 2004 technology or probably a hundred megabit cable.

5215
03:29:48,000 --> 03:29:50,518
Like the capacity we have access to

5216
03:29:50,518 --> 03:29:54,270
both in terms of compute and connectivity

5217
03:29:54,270 --> 03:29:57,990
is something that people haven't readjusted to.

5218
03:29:57,990 --> 03:29:59,430
And this happens sometimes in technology

5219
03:29:59,430 --> 03:30:01,203
where progress sneaks up on you.

5220
03:30:01,203 --> 03:30:03,090
This happened with SSDs.

5221
03:30:03,090 --> 03:30:04,410
I love that, by the way.

5222
03:30:04,410 --> 03:30:06,300
We designed so much of our technology

5223
03:30:06,300 --> 03:30:08,910
and storage approach and database design

5224
03:30:08,910 --> 03:30:11,047
around spinning metal disks

5225
03:30:11,047 --> 03:30:15,042
that had certain seek rate properties.

5226
03:30:15,042 --> 03:30:18,566
And then we went to NVMe and SSDs,

5227
03:30:18,566 --> 03:30:22,230
and it took quite a while for people to realize

5228
03:30:22,230 --> 03:30:24,060
that the systems had to be built

5229
03:30:24,060 --> 03:30:25,530
fundamentally different now.

5230
03:30:25,530 --> 03:30:28,693
That the difference between memory and disk

5231
03:30:28,693 --> 03:30:30,540
was now far smaller

5232
03:30:30,540 --> 03:30:33,210
when you weren't spinning these metal plates around

5233
03:30:33,210 --> 03:30:34,920
with a little head that had to read off them.

5234
03:30:34,920 --> 03:30:36,450
You were essentially just dealing

5235
03:30:36,450 --> 03:30:38,040
with another type of memory.

5236
03:30:38,040 --> 03:30:39,690
I think we're a little bit in that same phase

5237
03:30:39,690 --> 03:30:42,140
when it comes to the capacity of new businesses

5238
03:30:42,140 --> 03:30:45,510
to be launched literally out of your damn bedroom.

5239
03:30:45,510 --> 03:30:48,188
- So you can get pretty far with a large user based

5240
03:30:48,188 --> 03:30:49,756
with home labing?

5241
03:30:49,756 --> 03:30:51,780
- Absolutely. - That's exciting.

5242
03:30:51,780 --> 03:30:53,370
That's like the old school.

5243
03:30:53,370 --> 03:30:54,660
That's really exciting, right?

5244
03:30:54,660 --> 03:30:57,750
- It's bringing back the startup in the garage

5245
03:30:57,750 --> 03:31:00,750
in the literal physical sense of the word.

5246
03:31:00,750 --> 03:31:03,780
Now some of that is do we need to,

5247
03:31:03,780 --> 03:31:06,450
you can get relatively cheap cloud capacity

5248
03:31:06,450 --> 03:31:07,560
if you don't need very much.

5249
03:31:07,560 --> 03:31:08,707
- Hell yes, we need to.

5250
03:31:08,707 --> 03:31:11,910
I mean the feeling of doing that by yourself

5251
03:31:11,910 --> 03:31:16,170
of seeing LED lights in your own home.

5252
03:31:16,170 --> 03:31:17,738
I mean there's nothing like that.

5253
03:31:17,738 --> 03:31:18,630
- There's just an aesthetic to it

5254
03:31:18,630 --> 03:31:20,490
that I am completely in love with

5255
03:31:20,490 --> 03:31:21,600
and I wanna try to push on.

5256
03:31:21,600 --> 03:31:22,950
Now it's not gonna be the same

5257
03:31:22,950 --> 03:31:23,970
thing as getting out of the cloud.

5258
03:31:23,970 --> 03:31:25,710
I'm not sure our exit out of the cloud

5259
03:31:25,710 --> 03:31:27,300
was not the exit out of the data center.

5260
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:29,130
We basically just bought hardware,

5261
03:31:29,130 --> 03:31:31,211
shipped it to a professionally managed data center

5262
03:31:31,211 --> 03:31:33,978
that we didn't even actually touch.

5263
03:31:33,978 --> 03:31:36,000
This is the other misconception people have about

5264
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:36,833
moving out of the cloud.

5265
03:31:36,833 --> 03:31:38,375
That we have a bunch of people

5266
03:31:38,375 --> 03:31:39,930
who are constantly driving to a data center somewhere

5267
03:31:39,930 --> 03:31:43,073
to rack new boxes and change dead RAM.

5268
03:31:43,073 --> 03:31:45,990
That's not how things happen in the modern world at all.

5269
03:31:45,990 --> 03:31:50,003
We have a company called Summit, previously Deft,

5270
03:31:50,003 --> 03:31:52,560
that is what we call white gloves.

5271
03:31:52,560 --> 03:31:54,030
They work in the data center

5272
03:31:54,030 --> 03:31:55,297
when we need something like,

5273
03:31:55,297 --> 03:31:59,370
"Hey Deft, can you go down and swap the dead SSD

5274
03:31:59,370 --> 03:32:00,960
in box number six?"

5275
03:32:00,960 --> 03:32:01,830
They do it.

5276
03:32:01,830 --> 03:32:04,830
And what we see is akin to what someone working

5277
03:32:04,830 --> 03:32:05,880
with the cloud would see.

5278
03:32:05,880 --> 03:32:07,890
You see IP addresses coming online.

5279
03:32:07,890 --> 03:32:09,420
You see drives coming online.

5280
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:10,830
It's not that different,

5281
03:32:10,830 --> 03:32:12,893
but it is a whole heck of a lot cheaper

5282
03:32:12,893 --> 03:32:15,240
when you are operating at our scale.

5283
03:32:15,240 --> 03:32:16,470
And of course it is.

5284
03:32:16,470 --> 03:32:18,210
Of course it's cheaper to own things

5285
03:32:18,210 --> 03:32:20,760
if you need those things for years

5286
03:32:20,760 --> 03:32:22,590
rather than it is to rent it.

5287
03:32:22,590 --> 03:32:25,620
In no other domain would we confuse those two things

5288
03:32:25,620 --> 03:32:27,900
that it's cheaper to own for the long duration

5289
03:32:27,900 --> 03:32:29,100
than it is to rent.

5290
03:32:29,100 --> 03:32:32,250
- There is some gray area, like I've gotten a chance

5291
03:32:32,250 --> 03:32:33,831
to interact with the xAI team a bunch.

5292
03:32:33,831 --> 03:32:36,180
I'm probably going back out there in Memphis

5293
03:32:36,180 --> 03:32:39,510
to do a big podcast associated with the Grok release.

5294
03:32:39,510 --> 03:32:43,282
And those folks, in order to achieve the speed

5295
03:32:43,282 --> 03:32:45,462
of building up the cluster

5296
03:32:45,462 --> 03:32:48,030
and to solve some of the novel aspects

5297
03:32:48,030 --> 03:32:50,730
that have to do with the GPU, with the training,

5298
03:32:50,730 --> 03:32:52,470
they have to be a little bit more hands on.

5299
03:32:52,470 --> 03:32:54,390
It's a less white glove.

5300
03:32:54,390 --> 03:32:55,530
- Oh, and I love that, right?

5301
03:32:55,530 --> 03:32:57,180
They're dealing with a frontier problem

5302
03:32:57,180 --> 03:32:59,720
and they're dealing with it not by renting a bunch of GPUs

5303
03:32:59,720 --> 03:33:02,496
at a huge markup from their main competitor.

5304
03:33:02,496 --> 03:33:04,050
They're going like, "No, screw that.

5305
03:33:04,050 --> 03:33:06,210
We're gonna put a hundred thousand GPUs

5306
03:33:06,210 --> 03:33:07,608
in our own tents," right?

5307
03:33:07,608 --> 03:33:09,433
And build it in absolute record time.

5308
03:33:09,433 --> 03:33:12,530
So I think if anything, this is testament to the idea

5309
03:33:12,530 --> 03:33:15,360
that owning hardware can give you an advantage

5310
03:33:15,360 --> 03:33:17,490
both at the small scale, at the medium scale

5311
03:33:17,490 --> 03:33:19,637
and at the pioneer levels of computing.

5312
03:33:19,637 --> 03:33:21,810
- By the way, you know, speaking of teams,

5313
03:33:21,810 --> 03:33:23,940
that those are xAI,

5314
03:33:23,940 --> 03:33:28,940
Tesla are large companies, but all those folks,

5315
03:33:30,360 --> 03:33:31,380
I don't know what it is about,

5316
03:33:31,380 --> 03:33:35,703
you said Jeff is really good at finding good people,

5317
03:33:36,690 --> 03:33:39,030
at seeing strength in people.

5318
03:33:39,030 --> 03:33:41,010
Like Elon is also extremely,

5319
03:33:41,010 --> 03:33:42,270
I don't know what that is.

5320
03:33:42,270 --> 03:33:44,190
Actually, I've never actually seen,

5321
03:33:44,190 --> 03:33:45,810
maybe you could speak to that.

5322
03:33:45,810 --> 03:33:48,394
He's good at finding greatness.

5323
03:33:48,394 --> 03:33:51,990
- I don't think he's finding as much as he's attracting.

5324
03:33:51,990 --> 03:33:53,760
He's attracting the talent

5325
03:33:53,760 --> 03:33:57,660
because of the audacious of his goals and his mission.

5326
03:33:57,660 --> 03:34:00,030
The clarity by which he states it.

5327
03:34:00,030 --> 03:34:02,310
He doesn't have to go scour the earth

5328
03:34:02,310 --> 03:34:03,660
to find the best people.

5329
03:34:03,660 --> 03:34:04,800
The best people come to him

5330
03:34:04,800 --> 03:34:07,547
because he is, talking about Elon here,

5331
03:34:07,547 --> 03:34:11,220
one of the singular most invigorating figures.

5332
03:34:11,220 --> 03:34:13,530
In both the same order of the universe here,

5333
03:34:13,530 --> 03:34:15,180
haters and lovers, right?

5334
03:34:15,180 --> 03:34:17,610
Like he's having such an impact at such a scale

5335
03:34:17,610 --> 03:34:19,350
that of course he's gotta have literally

5336
03:34:19,350 --> 03:34:20,670
millions of people think

5337
03:34:20,670 --> 03:34:24,180
he's the worst person in the world

5338
03:34:24,180 --> 03:34:25,980
and he's also gonna have millions of people thinking

5339
03:34:25,980 --> 03:34:27,701
he's the greatest gift to humanity.

5340
03:34:27,701 --> 03:34:29,070
Depending on the day.

5341
03:34:29,070 --> 03:34:29,970
I'm somewhere in between.

5342
03:34:29,970 --> 03:34:32,190
But I'm more on the greatest gift to humanity

5343
03:34:32,190 --> 03:34:34,530
end of the scale than I'm on the other end of the scale.

5344
03:34:34,530 --> 03:34:39,060
And I think that really inspires people in a way

5345
03:34:39,060 --> 03:34:40,920
that we've almost forgotten

5346
03:34:40,920 --> 03:34:45,920
that that level of audacity is so rare that when we see it,

5347
03:34:46,316 --> 03:34:48,390
we don't fully know how to analyze it.

5348
03:34:48,390 --> 03:34:50,370
We think of Elon as finding great talent

5349
03:34:50,370 --> 03:34:52,020
and I'm sure he is also good at that.

5350
03:34:52,020 --> 03:34:55,721
But I also think that this beacon of the mission,

5351
03:34:55,721 --> 03:34:58,102
we're going to fucking Mars.

5352
03:34:58,102 --> 03:35:01,680
We're gonna transform transportation

5353
03:35:01,680 --> 03:35:03,360
into using electricity.

5354
03:35:03,360 --> 03:35:06,450
We're gonna cover the earth in internet

5355
03:35:06,450 --> 03:35:10,470
is so grand that there are days where I wake up and go like,

5356
03:35:10,470 --> 03:35:12,466
what the fuck am I doing with these to-do lists?

5357
03:35:12,466 --> 03:35:16,274
Like Jesus, should I go sign up for something like that?

5358
03:35:16,274 --> 03:35:19,068
Yeah, that sounds invigorating in a sense.

5359
03:35:19,068 --> 03:35:21,810
I can only imagine like a biking back

5360
03:35:21,810 --> 03:35:25,421
in 10, 50 going like, should we go to Normandy?

5361
03:35:25,421 --> 03:35:27,170
You may die along the way,

5362
03:35:27,170 --> 03:35:30,060
but oh boy, does that sound like a journey

5363
03:35:30,060 --> 03:35:31,020
and an adventure.

5364
03:35:31,020 --> 03:35:31,860
- There's a few components.

5365
03:35:31,860 --> 03:35:34,740
There's one definitely this bigger than life mission

5366
03:35:34,740 --> 03:35:37,280
and really believing it.

5367
03:35:37,280 --> 03:35:40,140
You know, every other sentence is about Mars,

5368
03:35:40,140 --> 03:35:41,090
like really believing it.

5369
03:35:41,090 --> 03:35:42,780
It doesn't really matter what,

5370
03:35:42,780 --> 03:35:44,837
like anybody else, the criticism, anything.

5371
03:35:44,837 --> 03:35:49,380
There's a very singular focused big mission.

5372
03:35:49,380 --> 03:35:50,700
But I think it also has to do a bunch

5373
03:35:50,700 --> 03:35:53,160
of the other components.

5374
03:35:53,160 --> 03:35:56,815
Like being able to hire well once the people,

5375
03:35:56,815 --> 03:35:58,698
once the beacon attracts.

5376
03:35:58,698 --> 03:36:02,850
And I've just seen people that don't necessarily on paper

5377
03:36:02,850 --> 03:36:05,419
have a resume with the track record.

5378
03:36:05,419 --> 03:36:08,460
I've seen really who now turned out

5379
03:36:08,460 --> 03:36:11,130
to be like legendary people.

5380
03:36:11,130 --> 03:36:13,822
He basically like tosses 'em the ball of leadership.

5381
03:36:13,822 --> 03:36:17,130
Sees something in them and says like, "You go."

5382
03:36:17,130 --> 03:36:19,680
And gives them the ownership and they run with it.

5383
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:21,360
And that happens at every scale.

5384
03:36:21,360 --> 03:36:23,850
That there's a real meritocracy.

5385
03:36:23,850 --> 03:36:25,473
And like there's something,

5386
03:36:27,546 --> 03:36:30,030
there's just like, you could see the flourishing

5387
03:36:30,030 --> 03:36:31,920
of human intellect in these meetings,

5388
03:36:31,920 --> 03:36:34,516
in these group getting together where they're like,

5389
03:36:34,516 --> 03:36:37,016
the energy is palpable.

5390
03:36:37,016 --> 03:36:41,339
It's like exciting for me to just be around that.

5391
03:36:41,339 --> 03:36:43,950
There's not many companies I've seen that

5392
03:36:43,950 --> 03:36:47,460
in because when a company becomes successful and larger,

5393
03:36:47,460 --> 03:36:50,117
it somehow suffocates that energy.

5394
03:36:50,117 --> 03:36:55,117
I guess you see in startups at the early stages.

5395
03:36:55,290 --> 03:36:59,100
But like it's cool to see it at a large company

5396
03:36:59,100 --> 03:37:01,920
that's actually able to achieve scale, you know?

5397
03:37:01,920 --> 03:37:04,140
- I think part of the secret there

5398
03:37:04,140 --> 03:37:07,627
is that Elon actually knows things.

5399
03:37:07,627 --> 03:37:09,480
And when you know things,

5400
03:37:09,480 --> 03:37:12,450
you can evaluate the quality of work products.

5401
03:37:12,450 --> 03:37:14,610
And when you can evaluate the quality of work products,

5402
03:37:14,610 --> 03:37:17,610
you can very quickly tell who's full of shit

5403
03:37:17,610 --> 03:37:19,530
and who will actually take you to Mars.

5404
03:37:19,530 --> 03:37:21,360
And you can fire the people who's full of shit

5405
03:37:21,360 --> 03:37:23,866
and you can bet on the people who get us to Mars.

5406
03:37:23,866 --> 03:37:27,240
That capacity to directly evaluate

5407
03:37:27,240 --> 03:37:30,437
the competency of individuals,

5408
03:37:30,437 --> 03:37:32,591
it's actually a little bit rare.

5409
03:37:32,591 --> 03:37:34,860
It's not widely distributed

5410
03:37:34,860 --> 03:37:38,040
amongst managers, hiring managers.

5411
03:37:38,040 --> 03:37:41,220
It's not something you can easily delegate

5412
03:37:41,220 --> 03:37:45,534
to people who are not very skilled at the work itself.

5413
03:37:45,534 --> 03:37:47,912
And Elon obviously knows a lot about a lot

5414
03:37:47,912 --> 03:37:51,840
and he can smell who knows stuff for real.

5415
03:37:51,840 --> 03:37:55,020
And is this at our tiny scale,

5416
03:37:55,020 --> 03:37:57,930
something I've tried to do in the same order

5417
03:37:57,930 --> 03:38:00,183
where when we hire programmers, for example,

5418
03:38:01,170 --> 03:38:02,730
it's gonna be interesting now with AI

5419
03:38:02,730 --> 03:38:03,600
as the new challenge.

5420
03:38:03,600 --> 03:38:05,249
But up until this point,

5421
03:38:05,249 --> 03:38:08,580
the main pivot point for getting hired

5422
03:38:08,580 --> 03:38:09,630
was not your resume,

5423
03:38:09,630 --> 03:38:11,820
was not the schooling you've had,

5424
03:38:11,820 --> 03:38:14,221
it was not your grades, was not your pedigree,

5425
03:38:14,221 --> 03:38:17,820
it was how well you did on two things.

5426
03:38:17,820 --> 03:38:19,560
A, your cover letter.

5427
03:38:19,560 --> 03:38:21,226
Because I can only work with people remotely

5428
03:38:21,226 --> 03:38:22,950
if they're good writers.

5429
03:38:22,950 --> 03:38:25,170
So if you can't pen a proper capital letter

5430
03:38:25,170 --> 03:38:26,909
and can't bother to put in the effort

5431
03:38:26,909 --> 03:38:29,821
to write it specifically for us, you're out.

5432
03:38:29,821 --> 03:38:33,606
Two, you have to be able to program really well

5433
03:38:33,606 --> 03:38:35,700
to the degree that I can look at your code

5434
03:38:35,700 --> 03:38:37,710
and go like, yeah, I wanna work with that person.

5435
03:38:37,710 --> 03:38:39,180
Not only I wanna work with that person,

5436
03:38:39,180 --> 03:38:41,070
I wanna work on that person's code

5437
03:38:41,070 --> 03:38:42,900
when I have to see it again in five years

5438
03:38:42,900 --> 03:38:44,490
to fix some damn bug.

5439
03:38:44,490 --> 03:38:47,070
So we're gonna give you a programming test

5440
03:38:47,070 --> 03:38:49,632
that simulates the way we work for real

5441
03:38:49,632 --> 03:38:51,180
and we're gonna see how you do.

5442
03:38:51,180 --> 03:38:53,280
And I've been surprised time and again

5443
03:38:53,280 --> 03:38:56,910
where I thought for sure this candidate is a shoe-in,

5444
03:38:56,910 --> 03:38:59,700
they sound just right, the CV is just right

5445
03:38:59,700 --> 03:39:02,070
and then you see the code getting turned in.

5446
03:39:02,070 --> 03:39:03,300
I'm like, no way.

5447
03:39:03,300 --> 03:39:05,447
No way are we hiring this person.

5448
03:39:05,447 --> 03:39:08,014
And the other way has been true as well.

5449
03:39:08,014 --> 03:39:11,940
I've go like, I don't know about this guy or this woman.

5450
03:39:11,940 --> 03:39:12,773
Eh, I dunno.

5451
03:39:13,950 --> 03:39:15,545
And then they turn in their coach stuff

5452
03:39:15,545 --> 03:39:16,378
and I'm like, holy shit,

5453
03:39:16,378 --> 03:39:19,773
can that person be on my team tomorrow, preferably?

5454
03:39:19,773 --> 03:39:22,260
The capacity to evaluate work product

5455
03:39:22,260 --> 03:39:24,090
is a superpower when it comes to hiring.

5456
03:39:24,090 --> 03:39:26,605
- There's a step that I've seen Elon do really well,

5457
03:39:26,605 --> 03:39:29,400
which is be able to show up and say,

5458
03:39:29,400 --> 03:39:30,817
this can be done simpler.

5459
03:39:30,817 --> 03:39:31,980
- [DHH] Yes.

5460
03:39:31,980 --> 03:39:33,420
- But he knows what he's talking about.

5461
03:39:33,420 --> 03:39:35,820
And then the engineer,

5462
03:39:35,820 --> 03:39:38,230
because Elon knows enough,

5463
03:39:38,230 --> 03:39:40,890
the engineer who's first reaction,

5464
03:39:40,890 --> 03:39:42,300
you can kind of tell like,

5465
03:39:42,300 --> 03:39:44,790
it's almost like rolling your eyes

5466
03:39:44,790 --> 03:39:46,619
if your parent tells you something.

5467
03:39:46,619 --> 03:39:49,327
This is not, no, we've I've been working

5468
03:39:49,327 --> 03:39:51,630
on this for a month, you don't...

5469
03:39:51,630 --> 03:39:53,593
But then when you have that conversation a little more,

5470
03:39:53,593 --> 03:39:56,970
you realize no, it can be done simpler.

5471
03:39:56,970 --> 03:39:58,260
Find the way.

5472
03:39:58,260 --> 03:40:01,228
So there's a good, when two engineers are talking,

5473
03:40:01,228 --> 03:40:03,391
one might not have perfect information.

5474
03:40:03,391 --> 03:40:08,391
But if the senior engineer has like good instinct

5475
03:40:09,072 --> 03:40:12,127
that's like been battle earned,

5476
03:40:12,127 --> 03:40:13,706
then you can say simplify.

5477
03:40:13,706 --> 03:40:17,357
And it actually will result in simplification.

5478
03:40:17,357 --> 03:40:20,880
- And I think this is the hallmark of the true greats.

5479
03:40:20,880 --> 03:40:22,560
That they not only have the insight

5480
03:40:22,560 --> 03:40:25,230
into what's required to do the work,

5481
03:40:25,230 --> 03:40:29,370
but they also have the transcendent vision

5482
03:40:29,370 --> 03:40:32,820
to go beyond what the engineer would do,

5483
03:40:32,820 --> 03:40:34,530
the programmer would do.

5484
03:40:34,530 --> 03:40:36,960
I think if we are looking at these rarities,

5485
03:40:36,960 --> 03:40:41,520
obviously the myth of Steve Jobs was also this.

5486
03:40:41,520 --> 03:40:44,010
Even though perhaps he was less technical

5487
03:40:44,010 --> 03:40:46,050
than Elon is in many ways,

5488
03:40:46,050 --> 03:40:49,647
he had the same capacity to show up to a product team

5489
03:40:49,647 --> 03:40:51,600
and really challenge them

5490
03:40:51,600 --> 03:40:53,340
to look harder for the simplification

5491
03:40:53,340 --> 03:40:55,640
or for making things greater

5492
03:40:55,640 --> 03:40:58,874
in a way that would garner disbelief

5493
03:40:58,874 --> 03:41:00,330
from the people who are supposed to do it.

5494
03:41:00,330 --> 03:41:01,530
Like this guy is full of shit.

5495
03:41:01,530 --> 03:41:02,583
Like this is crazy.

5496
03:41:03,612 --> 03:41:05,610
We can never, and then two months later it is.

5497
03:41:05,610 --> 03:41:07,950
So there is something of this

5498
03:41:07,950 --> 03:41:10,173
where you need the vision,

5499
03:41:10,173 --> 03:41:12,497
you need it anchored by the reality

5500
03:41:12,497 --> 03:41:15,150
of knowing enough about what's possible,

5501
03:41:15,150 --> 03:41:16,410
knowing enough about physics,

5502
03:41:16,410 --> 03:41:18,390
knowing enough about software,

5503
03:41:18,390 --> 03:41:20,190
that you're not just building bullshit.

5504
03:41:20,190 --> 03:41:21,900
There are plenty of people who can tell

5505
03:41:21,900 --> 03:41:22,800
a group of engineers.

5506
03:41:22,800 --> 03:41:24,300
No, just do it faster.

5507
03:41:24,300 --> 03:41:25,650
Like that's not a skill.

5508
03:41:25,650 --> 03:41:28,050
It's gotta be anchored in something real,

5509
03:41:28,050 --> 03:41:33,050
but it's also gonna be anchored in, it's a tired word,

5510
03:41:33,210 --> 03:41:36,210
but a passion for the outcome to a degree

5511
03:41:36,210 --> 03:41:39,960
where you get personally insulted if a bad job is done.

5512
03:41:39,960 --> 03:41:42,974
This is what I've been writing about lately with Apple.

5513
03:41:42,974 --> 03:41:44,910
They've lost that asshole

5514
03:41:44,910 --> 03:41:47,010
who would show up and tell engineers

5515
03:41:47,010 --> 03:41:50,610
that what they did was not good enough

5516
03:41:50,610 --> 03:41:52,650
in ways that would actually perhaps

5517
03:41:52,650 --> 03:41:55,560
make them feel a little small in the moment,

5518
03:41:55,560 --> 03:42:00,330
but would spark that zest to really fix it.

5519
03:42:00,330 --> 03:42:03,037
Now they have a logistics person

5520
03:42:03,037 --> 03:42:06,390
who's very good at sourcing components

5521
03:42:06,390 --> 03:42:09,643
and lining up production Gantt charts,

5522
03:42:09,643 --> 03:42:12,330
but you're not getting that magic.

5523
03:42:12,330 --> 03:42:14,730
Now what's interesting with that whole scenario

5524
03:42:14,730 --> 03:42:18,450
was I actually thought how well Tim Cook ran things

5525
03:42:18,450 --> 03:42:20,613
and has run things at Apple for so long

5526
03:42:20,613 --> 03:42:22,410
that maybe we were wrong.

5527
03:42:22,410 --> 03:42:26,387
Maybe we were wrong about the criticality of Steve Jobs

5528
03:42:26,387 --> 03:42:27,750
to the whole mission.

5529
03:42:27,750 --> 03:42:29,880
Maybe you could get away with not having it.

5530
03:42:29,880 --> 03:42:33,870
I think the bill was going to come later and now it has.

5531
03:42:33,870 --> 03:42:36,045
Apple is failing in all these ways

5532
03:42:36,045 --> 03:42:39,938
that someone who would blow up Steve's ghost

5533
03:42:39,938 --> 03:42:42,465
and really insult him would say like, see?

5534
03:42:42,465 --> 03:42:44,280
This is what's happening now.

5535
03:42:44,280 --> 03:42:46,440
So the other thing here too, of course,

5536
03:42:46,440 --> 03:42:47,906
is it's impossible to divorce.

5537
03:42:47,906 --> 03:42:51,365
Like your perception of what's a critical component

5538
03:42:51,365 --> 03:42:53,425
of the system and the messy reality

5539
03:42:53,425 --> 03:42:55,860
of a million different moving parts

5540
03:42:55,860 --> 03:42:57,060
in the reality of life.

5541
03:42:57,060 --> 03:43:00,030
And you should be skeptical about your own analysis

5542
03:43:00,030 --> 03:43:01,950
and your own thesis at all time.

5543
03:43:01,950 --> 03:43:04,132
- Since you mentioned Apple, I have to ask

5544
03:43:04,132 --> 03:43:08,373
somebody in the internet submitted the question.

5545
03:43:10,590 --> 03:43:12,420
Does DHH still hate Apple?

5546
03:43:12,420 --> 03:43:14,435
I believe the question is.

5547
03:43:14,435 --> 03:43:16,540
So there was a time

5548
03:43:17,400 --> 03:43:22,400
when Basecamp went to war with Apple over the 30%.

5549
03:43:22,695 --> 03:43:25,860
Can you tell the saga of that battle?

5550
03:43:25,860 --> 03:43:27,660
- Yes, but first I'll tell you,

5551
03:43:27,660 --> 03:43:29,010
I fell in love with Apple,

5552
03:43:29,010 --> 03:43:33,021
which was all the way back in also early 2000s

5553
03:43:33,021 --> 03:43:37,277
when Microsoft was dominating the industry

5554
03:43:37,277 --> 03:43:40,830
in a way we now see Apple

5555
03:43:40,830 --> 03:43:43,080
and Google dominate mobile phones.

5556
03:43:43,080 --> 03:43:44,610
Microsoft was just everything

5557
03:43:44,610 --> 03:43:45,960
when it came to personal computers,

5558
03:43:45,960 --> 03:43:48,930
and I really did not like the Microsoft of the '90s.

5559
03:43:48,930 --> 03:43:52,500
The Microsoft of the '90s was the cutoff the air supply

5560
03:43:52,500 --> 03:43:55,200
to Netscape kind of characters

5561
03:43:55,200 --> 03:43:57,472
was the Bill Gates sitting defiant

5562
03:43:57,472 --> 03:44:00,240
in an interview with the DOJ

5563
03:44:00,240 --> 03:44:03,420
asking about what the definition of what is.

5564
03:44:03,420 --> 03:44:06,413
And just overall unpleasant, I think.

5565
03:44:06,413 --> 03:44:08,880
You can have respect for what was achieved,

5566
03:44:08,880 --> 03:44:10,140
but I certainly didn't like it.

5567
03:44:10,140 --> 03:44:11,460
And as we've talked about,

5568
03:44:11,460 --> 03:44:15,567
I came begrudgingly to the PC after Commodore fell apart

5569
03:44:15,567 --> 03:44:17,940
and I couldn't continue to use the Amiga.

5570
03:44:17,940 --> 03:44:21,780
So I already had a bit of a bone to pick with PCs

5571
03:44:21,780 --> 03:44:23,880
just over the fact that I love my Amiga so much.

5572
03:44:23,880 --> 03:44:25,680
But then in the early 2000s,

5573
03:44:25,680 --> 03:44:28,470
Apple emerged as a credible alternative

5574
03:44:28,470 --> 03:44:31,394
because they bet the new generation of Macs

5575
03:44:31,394 --> 03:44:33,450
on Unix underpinnings.

5576
03:44:33,450 --> 03:44:37,172
And that allowed me to escape from Microsoft,

5577
03:44:37,172 --> 03:44:41,190
and suddenly I became one of the biggest boosters of Apple.

5578
03:44:41,190 --> 03:44:44,130
I was in my graduating class

5579
03:44:44,130 --> 03:44:46,320
at the Copenhagen Business School.

5580
03:44:46,320 --> 03:44:49,587
I started with the first white iBook,

5581
03:44:49,587 --> 03:44:51,120
first person using Mac.

5582
03:44:51,120 --> 03:44:52,845
And by the time we were done in graduating,

5583
03:44:52,845 --> 03:44:55,590
I had basically converted half the class

5584
03:44:55,590 --> 03:44:57,270
to using Apple computers,

5585
03:44:57,270 --> 03:44:58,921
'cause I would evangelize them so hard

5586
03:44:58,921 --> 03:45:00,600
and demonstrate them

5587
03:45:00,600 --> 03:45:03,990
and do all the things that a super fan would do.

5588
03:45:03,990 --> 03:45:07,320
And I continued that work over many years.

5589
03:45:07,320 --> 03:45:10,740
Jason or I actually in I think 2004, 2005,

5590
03:45:10,740 --> 03:45:12,750
did an ad for Apple

5591
03:45:12,750 --> 03:45:14,430
that they posted on the developer side

5592
03:45:14,430 --> 03:45:16,440
where we were all about like Apple is so integral

5593
03:45:16,440 --> 03:45:18,570
to everything that we do and we look up to them

5594
03:45:18,570 --> 03:45:20,251
and we are inspired by them.

5595
03:45:20,251 --> 03:45:23,010
And that love relationship actually

5596
03:45:23,010 --> 03:45:24,981
continued for a very long time.

5597
03:45:24,981 --> 03:45:29,558
I basically just became a Mac person for 20 years.

5598
03:45:29,558 --> 03:45:32,850
I didn't even care about looking at PCs.

5599
03:45:32,850 --> 03:45:36,090
It seemed irrelevant to me, whatever Microsoft was doing,

5600
03:45:36,090 --> 03:45:37,380
which felt like such a relief.

5601
03:45:37,380 --> 03:45:39,313
Because in the '90s,

5602
03:45:39,313 --> 03:45:41,280
I felt like I couldn't escape Microsoft

5603
03:45:41,280 --> 03:45:42,600
and suddenly I had found my escape.

5604
03:45:42,600 --> 03:45:44,580
And now I was with Apple and it was glorious

5605
03:45:44,580 --> 03:45:46,410
and they shared so many of my sensibilities

5606
03:45:46,410 --> 03:45:48,780
and my aesthetics and they kept pushing the envelope,

5607
03:45:48,780 --> 03:45:50,610
and there was so much to be proud of,

5608
03:45:50,610 --> 03:45:52,113
so much to look up to.

5609
03:45:53,392 --> 03:45:56,760
And then that sort of started to change with the iPhone,

5610
03:45:56,760 --> 03:46:00,270
which is weird because the iPhone is what made modern Apple.

5611
03:46:00,270 --> 03:46:03,840
It's what I lined up in 2007 together

5612
03:46:03,840 --> 03:46:07,530
with Jason for five hours to stand in the line

5613
03:46:07,530 --> 03:46:10,260
to buy a first generation product

5614
03:46:10,260 --> 03:46:12,630
where Apple staff would clap at you

5615
03:46:12,630 --> 03:46:14,322
when you walked out the store.

5616
03:46:14,322 --> 03:46:17,400
I don't know if you remember that. It was a whole ceremony

5617
03:46:17,400 --> 03:46:22,400
and it was part of that myth and mystique and awe of Apple.

5618
03:46:22,720 --> 03:46:25,830
So I wasn't in the market for other computers.

5619
03:46:25,830 --> 03:46:27,540
I wasn't in the market for other computer ideas.

5620
03:46:27,540 --> 03:46:29,310
I thought perhaps I'd be with the Mac

5621
03:46:29,310 --> 03:46:31,047
until the end of days.

5622
03:46:31,047 --> 03:46:35,370
But as Apple discovered the gold mine,

5623
03:46:35,370 --> 03:46:37,665
it is to operate a toll booth

5624
03:46:37,665 --> 03:46:39,720
where you don't have to innovate,

5625
03:46:39,720 --> 03:46:41,940
where you don't actually even have to make anything,

5626
03:46:41,940 --> 03:46:43,440
where you can just take 30%

5627
03:46:43,440 --> 03:46:44,968
of other people's business.

5628
03:46:44,968 --> 03:46:49,920
There was a rot that crept into the foundation

5629
03:46:49,920 --> 03:46:52,260
of Apple and that started all the way back

5630
03:46:52,260 --> 03:46:55,080
from the initial launch of the app store.

5631
03:46:55,080 --> 03:46:57,300
But I don't think we saw at the time,

5632
03:46:57,300 --> 03:46:58,380
I didn't see at the time

5633
03:46:58,380 --> 03:47:01,320
just how critical the mobile phone

5634
03:47:01,320 --> 03:47:03,120
would become to computing in general.

5635
03:47:03,120 --> 03:47:05,040
I thought when the iPhone came out that like,

5636
03:47:05,040 --> 03:47:06,270
oh, it's like a mobile phone.

5637
03:47:06,270 --> 03:47:08,820
I've had a mobile phone since the early '90s.

5638
03:47:08,820 --> 03:47:09,990
Well, it wasn't a mobile phone.

5639
03:47:09,990 --> 03:47:11,430
It was a mobile computer.

5640
03:47:11,430 --> 03:47:13,260
And even more than that,

5641
03:47:13,260 --> 03:47:14,760
it was the most important computer

5642
03:47:14,760 --> 03:47:16,410
or it would become the most important computer

5643
03:47:16,410 --> 03:47:18,570
for most people around the world.

5644
03:47:18,570 --> 03:47:20,810
Which meant that if you liked to make software

5645
03:47:20,810 --> 03:47:22,440
and wanted to sell it to people,

5646
03:47:22,440 --> 03:47:24,540
you had to go through that computer.

5647
03:47:24,540 --> 03:47:26,630
And if going through that computer meant

5648
03:47:26,630 --> 03:47:29,302
going through Apple's toll booth

5649
03:47:29,302 --> 03:47:32,100
and not just having to ask them permission,

5650
03:47:32,100 --> 03:47:36,150
which in and of itself was just an dignity.

5651
03:47:36,150 --> 03:47:37,470
When you're used to the internet

5652
03:47:37,470 --> 03:47:39,150
where you don't have to ask anyone permission

5653
03:47:39,150 --> 03:47:40,938
about anything, you buy a domain

5654
03:47:40,938 --> 03:47:42,330
and you launch a business

5655
03:47:42,330 --> 03:47:45,150
and if customers show up, boom, you're success.

5656
03:47:45,150 --> 03:47:47,190
And if they don't, well you're a failure.

5657
03:47:47,190 --> 03:47:50,070
Now suddenly before you could even launch,

5658
03:47:50,070 --> 03:47:52,530
you'd have to ask Apple for permission.

5659
03:47:52,530 --> 03:47:54,120
That always sat wrong with me.

5660
03:47:54,120 --> 03:47:58,837
But it wasn't until we launched HEY in 2001

5661
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:03,120
that I saw the full extent of the rot

5662
03:48:03,120 --> 03:48:05,007
that has snug into Apple's apple.

5663
03:48:05,007 --> 03:48:06,390
- For people who don't know

5664
03:48:06,390 --> 03:48:07,260
and we'll talk about it,

5665
03:48:07,260 --> 03:48:09,990
HEY is this amazing email

5666
03:48:09,990 --> 03:48:14,640
sort of attempt to solve the email problem.

5667
03:48:14,640 --> 03:48:17,760
- Yes, I like to pitch it as what Gmail

5668
03:48:17,760 --> 03:48:21,000
would've been with 20 years of lessons applied

5669
03:48:21,000 --> 03:48:23,160
in a way where they could actually ship.

5670
03:48:23,160 --> 03:48:26,250
Gmail was incredible when it launched in 2004.

5671
03:48:26,250 --> 03:48:28,230
And it still is a great product

5672
03:48:28,230 --> 03:48:32,100
but it's also trapped in its initial success.

5673
03:48:32,100 --> 03:48:34,430
You can't redesign Gmail today,

5674
03:48:34,430 --> 03:48:35,970
it just has way too many users.

5675
03:48:35,970 --> 03:48:38,940
So if you want fresh thinking on email,

5676
03:48:38,940 --> 03:48:40,742
I wanted fresh thinking on email.

5677
03:48:40,742 --> 03:48:42,720
I needed to build my own email system.

5678
03:48:42,720 --> 03:48:44,310
And not just my own email client.

5679
03:48:44,310 --> 03:48:46,050
That's what a lot of people have done over the years.

5680
03:48:46,050 --> 03:48:47,730
They build a client for Gmail,

5681
03:48:47,730 --> 03:48:49,615
but you're severely constrained

5682
03:48:49,615 --> 03:48:52,560
if you don't control the email server as well.

5683
03:48:52,560 --> 03:48:54,559
If you really wanna move the ball forward with email,

5684
03:48:54,559 --> 03:48:56,699
you have to control both the server and the client.

5685
03:48:56,699 --> 03:48:58,560
And that was the audacious mission

5686
03:48:58,560 --> 03:49:00,480
we set out to do with HEY.

5687
03:49:00,480 --> 03:49:02,555
And that was what's funny,

5688
03:49:02,555 --> 03:49:05,615
I thought our main obstacle here would be Gmail.

5689
03:49:05,615 --> 03:49:08,601
It's the 800 pound gorilla in the email space.

5690
03:49:08,601 --> 03:49:11,909
Something like 70% of all email in the US

5691
03:49:11,909 --> 03:49:14,490
is sent through Gmail.

5692
03:49:14,490 --> 03:49:15,600
I think their world rates

5693
03:49:15,600 --> 03:49:17,160
are probably in that neighborhood as well.

5694
03:49:17,160 --> 03:49:20,024
They're just absolutely huge

5695
03:49:20,024 --> 03:49:25,024
and trying to attack an enormous established competitor

5696
03:49:26,513 --> 03:49:30,390
like that who's so actually still loved

5697
03:49:30,390 --> 03:49:31,800
by plenty of people.

5698
03:49:31,800 --> 03:49:34,325
And is free seems like a suicide mission.

5699
03:49:34,325 --> 03:49:36,630
And it was only a mission we signed up for

5700
03:49:36,630 --> 03:49:38,910
because we had grown ambitious enough

5701
03:49:38,910 --> 03:49:40,710
after making Basecamp for 20 years

5702
03:49:40,710 --> 03:49:42,390
that we thought we could tackle that problem.

5703
03:49:42,390 --> 03:49:45,334
So I thought, hey, this is dumb.

5704
03:49:45,334 --> 03:49:49,674
I would not advise anyone to go head to head with Gmail.

5705
03:49:49,674 --> 03:49:51,690
That seems like a suicide mission.

5706
03:49:51,690 --> 03:49:53,430
We're gonna try anyway, because you know what?

5707
03:49:53,430 --> 03:49:54,955
If we fail it's gonna be fine.

5708
03:49:54,955 --> 03:49:57,090
We're just gonna build a better email experience

5709
03:49:57,090 --> 03:49:59,400
for me and Jason and the people at the company

5710
03:49:59,400 --> 03:50:01,086
and our cat, and that'll be okay

5711
03:50:01,086 --> 03:50:03,180
'cause we're gonna afford to do so.

5712
03:50:03,180 --> 03:50:06,030
But when we got ready to launch,

5713
03:50:06,030 --> 03:50:08,310
after spending two years building this product,

5714
03:50:08,310 --> 03:50:10,274
millions of dollars in investment to it.

5715
03:50:10,274 --> 03:50:12,810
We obviously needed mobile apps.

5716
03:50:12,810 --> 03:50:15,450
You're not gonna be a serious contender with email

5717
03:50:15,450 --> 03:50:16,920
if you're not on a mobile phone

5718
03:50:16,920 --> 03:50:18,720
and you need to be there with a native client.

5719
03:50:18,720 --> 03:50:20,550
So we had built a great native client

5720
03:50:20,550 --> 03:50:22,800
for both iOS and for Android.

5721
03:50:22,800 --> 03:50:24,240
And as we were getting ready to launch,

5722
03:50:24,240 --> 03:50:26,310
we submitted both of them to the app stores,

5723
03:50:26,310 --> 03:50:30,000
got both of them approved on I think Friday afternoon

5724
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:31,680
for the iOS app.

5725
03:50:31,680 --> 03:50:34,505
And we then went live on Monday.

5726
03:50:34,505 --> 03:50:36,510
And we were so excited.

5727
03:50:36,510 --> 03:50:39,237
Hey world, we've been working on this new thing,

5728
03:50:39,237 --> 03:50:41,119
I'd love for you to check it out.

5729
03:50:41,119 --> 03:50:43,110
And of course as with anything,

5730
03:50:43,110 --> 03:50:44,700
when you launch a new product, there are some bugs.

5731
03:50:44,700 --> 03:50:47,760
So we quickly found a few in the iOS client

5732
03:50:47,760 --> 03:50:49,890
and submitted a new build to Apple.

5733
03:50:49,890 --> 03:50:51,968
Hey, here's our bug faces, can you please update?

5734
03:50:51,968 --> 03:50:55,503
And that's when on help broke loose.

5735
03:50:56,430 --> 03:50:59,428
Not only were they not gonna prove our update,

5736
03:50:59,428 --> 03:51:01,440
they said, oh wait a minute,

5737
03:51:01,440 --> 03:51:03,450
we gave you permission to be in the app store,

5738
03:51:03,450 --> 03:51:05,283
but I'm sorry that was a mistake.

5739
03:51:05,283 --> 03:51:08,500
We see that you're not using our in-app payment system,

5740
03:51:08,500 --> 03:51:12,433
which means that we don't get 30% of your business.

5741
03:51:12,433 --> 03:51:14,730
You will have to rectify that

5742
03:51:14,730 --> 03:51:16,599
or you can't be in the app store.

5743
03:51:16,599 --> 03:51:19,920
And first I thought like, well it got approved already.

5744
03:51:19,920 --> 03:51:21,390
We're running on the same model.

5745
03:51:21,390 --> 03:51:24,773
We've run Basecamp on in the app store for a decade.

5746
03:51:24,773 --> 03:51:27,150
If you're not signing up through the app

5747
03:51:27,150 --> 03:51:30,030
and we're signing up our own customers on our own website

5748
03:51:30,030 --> 03:51:31,160
and they're just going to the app store

5749
03:51:31,160 --> 03:51:34,230
to download their companion app, we're gonna be fine.

5750
03:51:34,230 --> 03:51:35,682
That was the truth, right?

5751
03:51:35,682 --> 03:51:38,310
That was why I never got so fired up about the app store.

5752
03:51:38,310 --> 03:51:40,590
Even as Apple started tightening the screws

5753
03:51:40,590 --> 03:51:42,300
was like my business was okay.

5754
03:51:42,300 --> 03:51:44,610
Now suddenly my business wasn't okay.

5755
03:51:44,610 --> 03:51:49,380
Apple was willing to destroy HEY if we did not agree

5756
03:51:49,380 --> 03:51:52,098
to give them 30% of all the signups

5757
03:51:52,098 --> 03:51:54,390
that came through the iOS app.

5758
03:51:54,390 --> 03:51:56,468
And it wasn't just about the 30%.

5759
03:51:56,468 --> 03:51:58,450
It was also about splitting

5760
03:51:58,450 --> 03:52:01,298
and not longer having a direct relationship

5761
03:52:01,298 --> 03:52:02,760
with our customers.

5762
03:52:02,760 --> 03:52:05,070
When you sell an app in the app store,

5763
03:52:05,070 --> 03:52:07,110
you're not selling an app to a customer.

5764
03:52:07,110 --> 03:52:10,200
You're selling an app to inventory at Apple,

5765
03:52:10,200 --> 03:52:12,810
and then Apple sells an app to that customer.

5766
03:52:12,810 --> 03:52:16,260
That customer has a purchasing relationship with Apple.

5767
03:52:16,260 --> 03:52:20,100
So if you wanna give discounts or refunds or whatever,

5768
03:52:20,100 --> 03:52:21,570
it's complete hell.

5769
03:52:21,570 --> 03:52:24,604
If you want to easily support multi-platform

5770
03:52:24,604 --> 03:52:26,810
that's complete hell if someone signs up

5771
03:52:26,810 --> 03:52:30,150
for HEY on their iPhone and they wanna switch to Android.

5772
03:52:30,150 --> 03:52:33,210
But that billing relationship, it's tied to Apple,

5773
03:52:33,210 --> 03:52:34,440
it's complete hell.

5774
03:52:34,440 --> 03:52:35,880
For a million reasons,

5775
03:52:35,880 --> 03:52:38,370
I did not want to hand my business over to Apple.

5776
03:52:38,370 --> 03:52:41,085
I did not want to hand 30% of our revenue over to Apple.

5777
03:52:41,085 --> 03:52:43,500
So we decided to do something

5778
03:52:43,500 --> 03:52:45,905
that seemingly Apple had never heard before.

5779
03:52:45,905 --> 03:52:50,905
We said no, we're not gonna add the in-app payment.

5780
03:52:51,540 --> 03:52:54,240
I don't care if you're threatening us.

5781
03:52:54,240 --> 03:52:55,140
this is not fair,

5782
03:52:55,140 --> 03:52:59,840
this is not reasonable, please approve.

5783
03:52:59,840 --> 03:53:02,237
And of course they didn't and it escalated.

5784
03:53:02,237 --> 03:53:05,386
And after a couple of days we realized, you know what?

5785
03:53:05,386 --> 03:53:07,050
This isn't a mistake.

5786
03:53:07,050 --> 03:53:08,610
This isn't going away.

5787
03:53:08,610 --> 03:53:11,550
We're gonna be dead if they go through with this.

5788
03:53:11,550 --> 03:53:15,680
If we're not gonna yield and give them the 30%,

5789
03:53:15,680 --> 03:53:20,680
they're gonna kick us off unless we make such a racket

5790
03:53:21,360 --> 03:53:24,766
such noise that they will regret it.

5791
03:53:24,766 --> 03:53:26,580
And that's exactly what then happened.

5792
03:53:26,580 --> 03:53:29,230
We were blessed by the fact that we launched HEY

5793
03:53:30,437 --> 03:53:32,520
one week before the WWDC,

5794
03:53:32,520 --> 03:53:34,290
their Worldwide Developer Conference.

5795
03:53:34,290 --> 03:53:36,120
Where Apple loves to get up on stage

5796
03:53:36,120 --> 03:53:38,820
and harp on how much they do for developers,

5797
03:53:38,820 --> 03:53:40,080
how much they love them

5798
03:53:40,080 --> 03:53:42,210
and why you should bill for their new devices

5799
03:53:42,210 --> 03:53:43,910
and so on and so forth.

5800
03:53:43,910 --> 03:53:45,390
And then we also just happened

5801
03:53:45,390 --> 03:53:46,650
to have a platform on the internet,

5802
03:53:46,650 --> 03:53:50,190
which is very convenient when you need to go to war

5803
03:53:50,190 --> 03:53:52,260
with a $3 trillion company.

5804
03:53:52,260 --> 03:53:54,435
So I started kicking and screaming

5805
03:53:54,435 --> 03:53:56,310
- Oh boy. - And essentially

5806
03:53:56,310 --> 03:53:59,710
turning it up to 11 in terms of the fight

5807
03:53:59,710 --> 03:54:04,710
and going public with our or denial to be in the app store.

5808
03:54:05,160 --> 03:54:07,260
And that turned into a prolonged

5809
03:54:07,260 --> 03:54:09,120
two week battle with Apple

5810
03:54:09,120 --> 03:54:11,910
that essentially ended in the best possible outcome

5811
03:54:11,910 --> 03:54:14,760
we could have gotten as David fighting Goliath,

5812
03:54:14,760 --> 03:54:16,694
which was a bit of a truce.

5813
03:54:16,694 --> 03:54:19,530
We wouldn't hand 30% over to Apple.

5814
03:54:19,530 --> 03:54:21,720
They do wouldn't kick us out of the app store,

5815
03:54:21,720 --> 03:54:25,680
but we had to build some bullshit dummy account

5816
03:54:25,680 --> 03:54:28,650
such that the app did something when you downloaded it.

5817
03:54:28,650 --> 03:54:31,410
That was a rule that Phil Schiller seemingly made up

5818
03:54:31,410 --> 03:54:34,050
on the fly when pressed for the fifth time

5819
03:54:34,050 --> 03:54:36,870
by the media about why we couldn't be in the app store

5820
03:54:36,870 --> 03:54:39,270
when a million other companion apps could.

5821
03:54:39,270 --> 03:54:42,090
But we just happened to be able to create so much pain

5822
03:54:42,090 --> 03:54:45,330
and noise for Apple that it was easier for them

5823
03:54:45,330 --> 03:54:48,420
to just let us be than to keep on fighting.

5824
03:54:48,420 --> 03:54:52,200
- What do you think about Tim Sweeney's victory

5825
03:54:52,200 --> 03:54:54,120
with Epic over Apple?

5826
03:54:54,120 --> 03:54:56,610
- I think it is incredible

5827
03:54:56,610 --> 03:55:00,120
and the entire developer ecosystem.

5828
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:03,960
Not just on iOS but on Android as well,

5829
03:55:03,960 --> 03:55:06,000
owe Epic, Tim Sweeney

5830
03:55:06,000 --> 03:55:09,304
and Mark Rein, an enormous debt of gratitude

5831
03:55:09,304 --> 03:55:12,600
for taking on the only battle

5832
03:55:12,600 --> 03:55:16,800
that has ever inflicted a series wound on Apple

5833
03:55:16,800 --> 03:55:20,670
in this entire sorted campaign of monopoly enforcement.

5834
03:55:20,670 --> 03:55:22,833
And that is Epic's fight versus them.

5835
03:55:24,750 --> 03:55:26,250
Tim recently revealed

5836
03:55:26,250 --> 03:55:29,343
that it has cost well over a hundred million dollars

5837
03:55:29,343 --> 03:55:33,090
in legal fees to carry on this battle against Apple.

5838
03:55:33,090 --> 03:55:36,000
We, for a hot moment, considered suing Apple

5839
03:55:36,000 --> 03:55:37,650
when they were threatening to kick us out.

5840
03:55:37,650 --> 03:55:40,455
We shopped the case around with a few law firms

5841
03:55:40,455 --> 03:55:43,243
and perhaps of course they would tell us

5842
03:55:43,243 --> 03:55:44,460
you have a good case.

5843
03:55:44,460 --> 03:55:46,740
I mean they're trying to sell a product here,

5844
03:55:46,740 --> 03:55:47,910
but they would also tell us.

5845
03:55:47,910 --> 03:55:50,460
- It's gonna cost a minimum of $10 million

5846
03:55:50,460 --> 03:55:52,160
and it's gonna take five

5847
03:55:52,160 --> 03:55:54,540
to seven years through all the appeals.

5848
03:55:54,540 --> 03:55:56,801
Now we now learned the actual price tag

5849
03:55:56,801 --> 03:55:58,590
was 10 times higher, right?

5850
03:55:58,590 --> 03:56:00,570
Epic spend over 100 million.

5851
03:56:00,570 --> 03:56:02,070
It would've destroyed us

5852
03:56:02,070 --> 03:56:04,907
to take on Apple in the legal realm.

5853
03:56:04,907 --> 03:56:07,050
Only a company like Epic could do it

5854
03:56:07,050 --> 03:56:12,030
and only a company run by founders Like Tim,

5855
03:56:12,030 --> 03:56:16,080
like Mark could risk the business

5856
03:56:16,080 --> 03:56:17,427
in the way that they did,

5857
03:56:17,427 --> 03:56:19,650
the audacity they had to provoke

5858
03:56:19,650 --> 03:56:20,910
the fight in the first place,

5859
03:56:20,910 --> 03:56:22,770
which I thought was just incredible.

5860
03:56:22,770 --> 03:56:25,200
And to stick with it for the long term,

5861
03:56:25,200 --> 03:56:28,706
no board would've signed off on this lawsuit

5862
03:56:28,706 --> 03:56:31,884
to a professional CEO, no freaking way.

5863
03:56:31,884 --> 03:56:35,110
So the fact that they've been able to beat Apple

5864
03:56:35,110 --> 03:56:38,610
in also the most hilarious way possible,

5865
03:56:38,610 --> 03:56:40,080
I think it's just incredible.

5866
03:56:40,080 --> 03:56:43,320
'Cause remember their first victory

5867
03:56:43,320 --> 03:56:45,540
in the case was actually not much of a victory.

5868
03:56:45,540 --> 03:56:49,170
There were about 11 counts in the trial.

5869
03:56:49,170 --> 03:56:52,470
Apple basically won 10 of them

5870
03:56:52,470 --> 03:56:56,827
and the judge awarded Epic this one little win

5871
03:56:56,827 --> 03:57:01,260
that Apple couldn't tell 'em not to link out to the internet

5872
03:57:01,260 --> 03:57:04,050
to be able to do the payment processing.

5873
03:57:04,050 --> 03:57:05,760
So they won this one little thing.

5874
03:57:05,760 --> 03:57:09,319
And Apple, instead of just taking the 10 out of 11 wins

5875
03:57:09,319 --> 03:57:12,540
and going fine, you can have your little links

5876
03:57:12,540 --> 03:57:14,460
but all these other rules stay in place

5877
03:57:14,460 --> 03:57:18,131
decided to essentially commit criminal contempt of court

5878
03:57:18,131 --> 03:57:22,120
as they've now been referred to for prosecution

5879
03:57:23,333 --> 03:57:26,610
and angered the judge to such a degree

5880
03:57:26,610 --> 03:57:29,520
that the rule of law in the US now

5881
03:57:29,520 --> 03:57:32,490
is that you can launch an app in the app store.

5882
03:57:32,490 --> 03:57:34,230
And you don't have to use in-app payment,

5883
03:57:34,230 --> 03:57:36,300
but you can have a direct billing relationship

5884
03:57:36,300 --> 03:57:39,150
with a customer if you just link out to the open internet

5885
03:57:39,150 --> 03:57:40,620
when you take the credit card

5886
03:57:40,620 --> 03:57:42,347
and then hop back into the app.

5887
03:57:42,347 --> 03:57:45,090
And we owe all of that to Tim and Mark.

5888
03:57:45,090 --> 03:57:46,980
We owe all of that to Epic.

5889
03:57:46,980 --> 03:57:49,350
We're gonna launch new apps any minute now,

5890
03:57:49,350 --> 03:57:52,740
I hope actually next week to take advantage of this

5891
03:57:52,740 --> 03:57:55,500
that revamp the hey apps so that people

5892
03:57:55,500 --> 03:57:58,380
who download the Hey app off the Apple app store

5893
03:57:58,380 --> 03:58:02,372
can sign up in the app and can then use the web

5894
03:58:02,372 --> 03:58:04,765
to put in their credit card so we don't have to pay 30%.

5895
03:58:04,765 --> 03:58:06,960
Instead we have a direct billing relationship

5896
03:58:06,960 --> 03:58:10,860
and such that they can take that subscription to Android,

5897
03:58:10,860 --> 03:58:13,560
to PCs, whatever without any hassle.

5898
03:58:13,560 --> 03:58:16,080
And we have Tim and Mark to thank for it.

5899
03:58:16,080 --> 03:58:18,657
- Yeah, Tim, I mean, like you said founders

5900
03:58:18,657 --> 03:58:20,850
but also specific kind of founders.

5901
03:58:20,850 --> 03:58:23,460
'Cause I think maybe you can educate me on this,

5902
03:58:23,460 --> 03:58:27,600
but Tim is somebody who maintains.

5903
03:58:27,600 --> 03:58:31,966
to this day sort of the unreasonableness of principles.

5904
03:58:31,966 --> 03:58:33,300
Yes, that's what I love.

5905
03:58:33,300 --> 03:58:34,890
I think sometimes maybe even

5906
03:58:34,890 --> 03:58:36,603
with founders you can get worn down.

5907
03:58:36,603 --> 03:58:38,220
It's a large company.

5908
03:58:38,220 --> 03:58:39,840
There's a lot of smart, quote, unquote,

5909
03:58:39,840 --> 03:58:42,713
people around you lawyers and just whispering

5910
03:58:42,713 --> 03:58:43,677
your ear over time

5911
03:58:43,677 --> 03:58:45,637
and you're like, well just be reasonable being a, you know,

5912
03:58:45,637 --> 03:58:47,190
this is a different thing.

5913
03:58:47,190 --> 03:58:50,168
And to be the sort of maintain,

5914
03:58:50,168 --> 03:58:52,473
I mean Steve Jobs did this.

5915
03:58:53,609 --> 03:58:56,315
Still are the asshole.

5916
03:58:56,315 --> 03:58:58,023
Who' says, "No,

5917
03:58:58,877 --> 03:59:02,580
I'll sink this whole fucking company over this."

5918
03:59:02,580 --> 03:59:06,030
- That's the exact language basically I used

5919
03:59:06,030 --> 03:59:07,740
in our original campaign.

5920
03:59:07,740 --> 03:59:09,930
I will burn this business down

5921
03:59:09,930 --> 03:59:13,110
before I hand over 30% of it to Apple.

5922
03:59:13,110 --> 03:59:14,880
And that sort of indignation,

5923
03:59:14,880 --> 03:59:17,290
that actual rage is something I try

5924
03:59:17,290 --> 03:59:19,170
to be a little careful about tapping into

5925
03:59:19,170 --> 03:59:22,410
because it is a little bit of a volatile compound.

5926
03:59:22,410 --> 03:59:24,300
Because I mean I have a bunch of employees,

5927
03:59:24,300 --> 03:59:25,980
we have a bunch of customers.

5928
03:59:25,980 --> 03:59:29,160
It would be pretty sad if the journey of 37 signals

5929
03:59:29,160 --> 03:59:30,990
after 25 years would come to an end

5930
03:59:30,990 --> 03:59:33,510
because Apple would burn us down

5931
03:59:33,510 --> 03:59:34,830
or I would burn the business down

5932
03:59:34,830 --> 03:59:36,480
over this fight with Apple.

5933
03:59:36,480 --> 03:59:39,240
But I think you also need that level of conviction

5934
03:59:39,240 --> 03:59:42,060
to be able to even drive the day-to-day decisions.

5935
03:59:42,060 --> 03:59:43,770
One of the other Apple examples,

5936
03:59:43,770 --> 03:59:45,570
and I know we're racking on Apple a little bit here,

5937
03:59:45,570 --> 03:59:47,340
and I don't actually hate them.

5938
03:59:47,340 --> 03:59:48,450
I really don't.

5939
03:59:48,450 --> 03:59:50,592
I am tremendously disappointed

5940
03:59:50,592 --> 03:59:54,690
at the squandered relationship that did not need

5941
03:59:54,690 --> 03:59:58,230
to be sold away for so little.

5942
03:59:58,230 --> 04:00:01,110
Now I understand that the app store toll booth

5943
04:00:01,110 --> 04:00:02,340
is actually a pretty big business.

5944
04:00:02,340 --> 04:00:04,050
It's multiple billions,

5945
04:00:04,050 --> 04:00:06,330
but Apple is a trillion dollar company.

5946
04:00:06,330 --> 04:00:08,340
And I think in the lens of history,

5947
04:00:08,340 --> 04:00:10,800
this is gonna come off as a tremendous mistake

5948
04:00:10,800 --> 04:00:13,470
and I think it's already coming off as a tremendous mistake.

5949
04:00:13,470 --> 04:00:15,660
The flop that was the Vision Pro

5950
04:00:15,660 --> 04:00:18,480
was partly because Apple had pissed off

5951
04:00:18,480 --> 04:00:20,310
every other developer.

5952
04:00:20,310 --> 04:00:24,030
No one was eager to come build the kind of experiences

5953
04:00:24,030 --> 04:00:25,800
for their new hardware

5954
04:00:25,800 --> 04:00:27,990
that would perhaps have made it a success.

5955
04:00:27,990 --> 04:00:31,470
So when you're on top and you have all the cards,

5956
04:00:31,470 --> 04:00:33,300
you can dilute yourself into thinking

5957
04:00:33,300 --> 04:00:35,760
that you can dictate all terms at all times

5958
04:00:35,760 --> 04:00:38,220
and there are no long term consequences.

5959
04:00:38,220 --> 04:00:39,930
Apple is learning finally,

5960
04:00:39,930 --> 04:00:42,120
the fact that there are long-term consequences

5961
04:00:42,120 --> 04:00:43,170
and that developers actually

5962
04:00:43,170 --> 04:00:45,240
are important to Apple's business.

5963
04:00:45,240 --> 04:00:47,670
And the relationship is not entirely one sided.

5964
04:00:47,670 --> 04:00:51,480
We don't owe our existence to Apple and Apple alone.

5965
04:00:51,480 --> 04:00:53,700
We've built our own customer bases.

5966
04:00:53,700 --> 04:00:56,340
Apple has been beneficial to the industry.

5967
04:00:56,340 --> 04:00:59,640
I'm glad the iPhone exists, da da da da.

5968
04:00:59,640 --> 04:01:01,920
It's not that it doesn't go both ways,

5969
04:01:01,920 --> 04:01:03,750
but Apple wants it only one way.

5970
04:01:03,750 --> 04:01:06,900
And I think that is a mistake,

5971
04:01:06,900 --> 04:01:09,334
and it's a mistake that was avoidable.

5972
04:01:09,334 --> 04:01:12,990
And A, that's disappointing.

5973
04:01:12,990 --> 04:01:14,130
Certainly disappointing for me.

5974
04:01:14,130 --> 04:01:15,600
I've literally spent 20 years

5975
04:01:15,600 --> 04:01:17,130
evangelizing this shit, right?

5976
04:01:17,130 --> 04:01:21,561
I've spent so much money buying Apple hardware,

5977
04:01:21,561 --> 04:01:25,200
excusing a bunch of things they've done over the years.

5978
04:01:25,200 --> 04:01:27,603
And then for what?

5979
04:01:28,860 --> 04:01:31,590
For the fact that you wanted 30% of something

5980
04:01:31,590 --> 04:01:34,834
that I created in the most unreasonable way possible?

5981
04:01:34,834 --> 04:01:37,020
Couldn't we have found a better way to do this?

5982
04:01:37,020 --> 04:01:39,960
I think they're going to get forced to do a better way.

5983
04:01:39,960 --> 04:01:42,690
But did you also have to go through the indignity

5984
04:01:42,690 --> 04:01:45,270
of having a criminal contempt charge

5985
04:01:45,270 --> 04:01:48,180
against you getting referred to prosecution?

5986
04:01:48,180 --> 04:01:50,370
It just seems so beneath Apple,

5987
04:01:50,370 --> 04:01:52,140
but it also seems so in line

5988
04:01:52,140 --> 04:01:54,510
with what happens to huge companies

5989
04:01:54,510 --> 04:01:58,110
who are run by, quote, unquote, "professional managers"

5990
04:01:58,110 --> 04:02:01,440
rather than founders and unreasonable people.

5991
04:02:01,440 --> 04:02:03,063
- Well, we should probably also say

5992
04:02:03,063 --> 04:02:05,460
that the thing you love about Apple,

5993
04:02:05,460 --> 04:02:09,180
the great spirit of Apple I think still persists

5994
04:02:09,180 --> 04:02:11,720
and there's a case to be made that this 30% thing

5995
04:02:11,720 --> 04:02:14,070
is a slice, a particular slice of a company,

5996
04:02:14,070 --> 04:02:17,010
not a defining aspect of the company.

5997
04:02:17,010 --> 04:02:20,220
And that it Apple is still on top in the hardware

5998
04:02:20,220 --> 04:02:22,980
that it makes and a lot of things that it makes.

5999
04:02:22,980 --> 04:02:27,889
And you know this is, that could be just a hiccup

6000
04:02:27,889 --> 04:02:30,540
in a long story of a great company

6001
04:02:30,540 --> 04:02:33,900
that does a lot of awesome stuff for humanity.

6002
04:02:33,900 --> 04:02:36,510
So like Apple is a truly special company.

6003
04:02:36,510 --> 04:02:40,230
We mentioned Amazon, there is no company like Apple.

6004
04:02:40,230 --> 04:02:43,020
- I agree, this is why the disappointment

6005
04:02:43,020 --> 04:02:44,670
is all greater.

6006
04:02:44,670 --> 04:02:47,580
Because we had such high aspirations

6007
04:02:47,580 --> 04:02:49,680
and expectations to Apple

6008
04:02:49,680 --> 04:02:53,010
that they were the shining city on the hill

6009
04:02:53,010 --> 04:02:55,050
and they were guiding the industry

6010
04:02:55,050 --> 04:02:57,390
in a million positive ways.

6011
04:02:57,390 --> 04:02:59,460
I think as we talked about earlier,

6012
04:02:59,460 --> 04:03:01,080
hardware is exciting again

6013
04:03:01,080 --> 04:03:05,460
in large part because Apple bought PA Semi

6014
04:03:05,460 --> 04:03:09,540
and pursued a against all odds

6015
04:03:09,540 --> 04:03:13,470
mission to get ARM up to the level it is today.

6016
04:03:13,470 --> 04:03:16,619
And we have these incredible M chips now because of it.

6017
04:03:16,619 --> 04:03:19,671
And the design sensibilities

6018
04:03:19,671 --> 04:03:23,417
that Apple bring to the table are unparalleled.

6019
04:03:23,417 --> 04:03:27,570
No one has taste certainly at the hardware level

6020
04:03:27,570 --> 04:03:29,760
like Apple does, even at the software level.

6021
04:03:29,760 --> 04:03:32,700
I'd say there's a lot of taste left in Apple,

6022
04:03:32,700 --> 04:03:34,620
but there's also some real sour taste now.

6023
04:03:34,620 --> 04:03:37,290
So they have to wash that off first I think

6024
04:03:37,290 --> 04:03:38,730
before they find their wear back.

6025
04:03:38,730 --> 04:03:41,525
But Apple's been in a mirage before,

6026
04:03:41,525 --> 04:03:44,520
I mean Wozniak and Steve Jobs

6027
04:03:44,520 --> 04:03:45,720
started this thing in the garage,

6028
04:03:45,720 --> 04:03:48,240
has great success with the Apple II.

6029
04:03:48,240 --> 04:03:51,189
He hands the company over to a sugar drink salesman

6030
04:03:51,189 --> 04:03:54,330
who tanks the company into the '90s.

6031
04:03:54,330 --> 04:03:56,280
He doesn't learn the lesson,

6032
04:03:56,280 --> 04:03:59,610
spends the next 20 years building up this amazing company,

6033
04:03:59,610 --> 04:04:04,290
then hands the company over again to a logistics person

6034
04:04:04,290 --> 04:04:07,440
who presumably had more redeeming qualities

6035
04:04:07,440 --> 04:04:09,925
than the first guy who put in charge,

6036
04:04:09,925 --> 04:04:13,830
but still ends up leading the company astray.

6037
04:04:13,830 --> 04:04:16,470
Now this is the norm.

6038
04:04:16,470 --> 04:04:20,400
The norm is that great companies don't last forever.

6039
04:04:20,400 --> 04:04:21,930
In the long arc of history,

6040
04:04:21,930 --> 04:04:24,150
almost no company lasts forever.

6041
04:04:24,150 --> 04:04:26,520
There are very few companies around

6042
04:04:26,520 --> 04:04:28,410
that was here 100 years ago,

6043
04:04:28,410 --> 04:04:30,150
even fewer 200 years ago.

6044
04:04:30,150 --> 04:04:32,430
And virtually nothing that are 1000 years old

6045
04:04:32,430 --> 04:04:35,100
outside of a handful of Japanese sorts makers

6046
04:04:35,100 --> 04:04:36,420
or something like that, right?

6047
04:04:36,420 --> 04:04:39,161
So you can get diluted into thinking

6048
04:04:39,161 --> 04:04:41,880
that something is forever when you're in the moment.

6049
04:04:41,880 --> 04:04:43,380
And they seem so large.

6050
04:04:43,380 --> 04:04:44,910
Apple could absolutely stumble

6051
04:04:44,910 --> 04:04:49,290
and I think they have more reason to stumble now than ever.

6052
04:04:49,290 --> 04:04:52,199
They're behind on AI, terribly behind.

6053
04:04:52,199 --> 04:04:56,354
Their software quality is faltering in a bunch of ways.

6054
04:04:56,354 --> 04:04:59,400
The competition is catching up on the hardware game

6055
04:04:59,400 --> 04:05:03,150
in part because TSMC is not an Apple subsidiary,

6056
04:05:03,150 --> 04:05:07,500
but a foundry that services a MD and NVIDIA and others

6057
04:05:07,500 --> 04:05:10,740
who are now able to use the same kind of advanced processes.

6058
04:05:10,740 --> 04:05:11,940
This is something I learned

6059
04:05:11,940 --> 04:05:14,490
after not looking at PC hardware for the longest time,

6060
04:05:14,490 --> 04:05:17,880
that holy smokes, AMD actually makes CPUs

6061
04:05:17,880 --> 04:05:20,550
that are just as fast, if not faster than apples.

6062
04:05:20,550 --> 04:05:21,900
They're not quite as efficient yet

6063
04:05:21,900 --> 04:05:25,739
because ARM has some fundamental efficiencies over x86,

6064
04:05:25,739 --> 04:05:27,180
but they're still pretty good.

6065
04:05:27,180 --> 04:05:30,240
So Apple should have reason to worry.

6066
04:05:30,240 --> 04:05:33,870
Apple's shareholders should have reason to be concerned.

6067
04:05:33,870 --> 04:05:36,630
Not just about all these stumbles,

6068
04:05:36,630 --> 04:05:40,647
but also by the fact that Apple is run by old people.

6069
04:05:40,647 --> 04:05:45,647
Apple's board has an average age of, I think, 75.

6070
04:05:45,690 --> 04:05:48,480
Their entire executive team is above 60.

6071
04:05:48,480 --> 04:05:52,242
Now that sounds horribly ageist.

6072
04:05:52,242 --> 04:05:54,900
And in some ways, it a little bit is.

6073
04:05:54,900 --> 04:05:57,240
In the same way, I'm ageist against myself.

6074
04:05:57,240 --> 04:06:02,240
Like I'm 45 now and I sort of kind of have to force myself

6075
04:06:02,340 --> 04:06:04,718
to really get into AI because it is such a paradigm shift

6076
04:06:04,718 --> 04:06:08,910
and a lot of people when they reach a certain age

6077
04:06:08,910 --> 04:06:11,070
are just happy to stay with what they know.

6078
04:06:11,070 --> 04:06:12,690
They don't wanna go back to being a beginner.

6079
04:06:12,690 --> 04:06:16,029
They don't wanna go back to having to relearn everything.

6080
04:06:16,029 --> 04:06:19,470
And I think like, ah, this is a little hard for me at 45.

6081
04:06:19,470 --> 04:06:21,243
How the hell do you do that at 75?

6082
04:06:22,710 --> 04:06:25,800
- I have to come back to, you mentioned it earlier,

6083
04:06:25,800 --> 04:06:27,330
you're a parent.

6084
04:06:27,330 --> 04:06:30,990
Can you speak to the impact that becoming a father

6085
04:06:30,990 --> 04:06:32,580
has had on your life?

6086
04:06:32,580 --> 04:06:35,820
- I think what's funny about fatherhood is that for me,

6087
04:06:35,820 --> 04:06:38,730
I wasn't even sure it's something I wanted.

6088
04:06:38,730 --> 04:06:42,360
It took meeting the right woman

6089
04:06:42,360 --> 04:06:45,093
and letting her convince me

6090
04:06:45,093 --> 04:06:50,093
That this was the right idea before we even got started.

6091
04:06:50,370 --> 04:06:52,950
I didn't have starting my own family

6092
04:06:52,950 --> 04:06:55,200
on the list of priorities

6093
04:06:55,200 --> 04:06:58,023
in my late 20s or even early 30s.

6094
04:06:59,100 --> 04:07:03,438
It was really the impetus of meeting my wife Jamie

6095
04:07:03,438 --> 04:07:07,320
and her telling me this is what I want.

6096
04:07:07,320 --> 04:07:09,120
I wanna have a family.

6097
04:07:09,120 --> 04:07:10,290
I wanna get married.

6098
04:07:10,290 --> 04:07:11,610
I wanna have kids.

6099
04:07:11,610 --> 04:07:12,986
I wanna have three.

6100
04:07:12,986 --> 04:07:17,986
And me going for a second like whoa, whoa, whoa.

6101
04:07:19,260 --> 04:07:22,953
And then eh, all right, let's do it.

6102
04:07:24,060 --> 04:07:28,290
And I think that's the kind of happy accident

6103
04:07:28,290 --> 04:07:31,470
where some parts of my life have been very driven,

6104
04:07:31,470 --> 04:07:33,450
where I knew exactly what I wanted

6105
04:07:33,450 --> 04:07:34,770
and how to push forward to it

6106
04:07:34,770 --> 04:07:37,457
and what the payoff was going to be.

6107
04:07:37,457 --> 04:07:40,842
But when it comes to having a family,

6108
04:07:40,842 --> 04:07:44,910
that always felt like a very fuzzy abstract idea

6109
04:07:44,910 --> 04:07:48,821
that sure, someday, maybe.

6110
04:07:48,821 --> 04:07:50,670
And then it became very concrete

6111
04:07:50,670 --> 04:07:53,913
because I met a woman who knew what she wanted.

6112
04:07:55,380 --> 04:07:58,623
And looking back on it now,

6113
04:07:59,490 --> 04:08:02,670
it almost seems crazy.

6114
04:08:02,670 --> 04:08:05,360
Like there's this fork in the road of reality.

6115
04:08:05,360 --> 04:08:07,590
Where if that hadn't happened

6116
04:08:07,590 --> 04:08:09,755
and I had been sitting here now,

6117
04:08:09,755 --> 04:08:12,933
not being a father, not having a family,

6118
04:08:13,860 --> 04:08:18,120
the level of regret knowing what I know now about

6119
04:08:18,120 --> 04:08:21,102
the joys of having that family

6120
04:08:21,102 --> 04:08:26,102
would've been existential, would've been...

6121
04:08:27,630 --> 04:08:29,130
I don't know if they would've been devastating.

6122
04:08:29,130 --> 04:08:32,280
I think men have a little bit of a longer window

6123
04:08:32,280 --> 04:08:35,310
to pursue these things than women do.

6124
04:08:35,310 --> 04:08:38,610
There are just certain biological facts.

6125
04:08:38,610 --> 04:08:42,930
But ending up with the family I have now,

6126
04:08:42,930 --> 04:08:45,460
ending up with my three boys have been

6127
04:08:46,890 --> 04:08:49,170
just a transformative experience in the sense

6128
04:08:49,170 --> 04:08:50,970
that here's something that turned out

6129
04:08:50,970 --> 04:08:53,422
to be the most important thing.

6130
04:08:53,422 --> 04:08:55,500
And it was an open secret.

6131
04:08:55,500 --> 04:08:56,640
Not even an open secret.

6132
04:08:56,640 --> 04:08:59,670
It was an open truth through all of history.

6133
04:08:59,670 --> 04:09:01,740
You listen to anyone who's ever had children,

6134
04:09:01,740 --> 04:09:02,573
they will all say,

6135
04:09:02,573 --> 04:09:04,800
"My children are the most important to me."

6136
04:09:04,800 --> 04:09:07,147
Yet somehow that wisdom couldn't sink in

6137
04:09:07,147 --> 04:09:09,387
until you were in the situation yourself.

6138
04:09:09,387 --> 04:09:12,150
I find those truths fascinating

6139
04:09:12,150 --> 04:09:16,078
when you can't actually relay them with words.

6140
04:09:16,078 --> 04:09:20,160
I can tell you, Hey Lex, what are you doing?

6141
04:09:20,160 --> 04:09:20,993
Get a wife,

6142
04:09:20,993 --> 04:09:22,414
make some kids,

6143
04:09:22,414 --> 04:09:23,778
get a move on it.

6144
04:09:23,778 --> 04:09:25,200
And these are just words.

6145
04:09:25,200 --> 04:09:27,360
They're not communicating the gravity

6146
04:09:27,360 --> 04:09:29,430
of what it actually feels to go through the experience.

6147
04:09:29,430 --> 04:09:32,877
And you can't really learn it without going through it.

6148
04:09:32,877 --> 04:09:35,640
Now of course you could be influenced and whatever,

6149
04:09:35,640 --> 04:09:37,530
we can all help contribute and little sparks

6150
04:09:37,530 --> 04:09:40,680
and little seeds can grow in your your mind about it.

6151
04:09:40,680 --> 04:09:42,030
But it still has to happen.

6152
04:09:42,930 --> 04:09:47,460
And now that I am in this situation

6153
04:09:47,460 --> 04:09:51,150
and just the sheer joy on a daily basis

6154
04:09:51,150 --> 04:09:54,690
where you think your level of life satisfaction

6155
04:09:54,690 --> 04:09:56,855
is on a scale of one to 10,

6156
04:09:56,855 --> 04:09:58,770
and then the satisfaction

6157
04:09:58,770 --> 04:10:01,680
of seeing your children understand something,

6158
04:10:01,680 --> 04:10:05,100
accomplish something, learn something,

6159
04:10:05,100 --> 04:10:07,260
do something, just be.

6160
04:10:07,260 --> 04:10:08,760
Just goes like, oh my god,

6161
04:10:08,760 --> 04:10:10,620
the scale doesn't go from one to 10.

6162
04:10:10,620 --> 04:10:12,750
It goes from one to 100.

6163
04:10:12,750 --> 04:10:14,347
And I've been playing down here

6164
04:10:14,347 --> 04:10:16,950
in the one to 10 range all this time.

6165
04:10:16,950 --> 04:10:19,750
And there's a one to 100

6166
04:10:20,760 --> 04:10:22,892
that has been humbling

6167
04:10:22,892 --> 04:10:26,844
in a way that is impactful in and of itself.

6168
04:10:26,844 --> 04:10:31,650
This whole idea that I thought I had a fair understanding

6169
04:10:31,650 --> 04:10:35,190
of like the boundaries of life in my early 30s,

6170
04:10:35,190 --> 04:10:36,210
like what is this about?

6171
04:10:36,210 --> 04:10:38,160
I mean, I've been on this earth long enough now

6172
04:10:38,160 --> 04:10:39,330
here to know something.

6173
04:10:39,330 --> 04:10:41,157
And you realize, I don't know, I did not know.

6174
04:10:41,157 --> 04:10:46,157
I did not know that the scale was much broader.

6175
04:10:46,380 --> 04:10:51,177
And I've often talked about joys of having kids

6176
04:10:51,177 --> 04:10:53,797
and just seeing your own DNA,

6177
04:10:53,797 --> 04:10:56,880
which is remarkable to me

6178
04:10:56,880 --> 04:10:59,700
because literally that's been the pursuit of humans

6179
04:10:59,700 --> 04:11:00,960
since the dawn of time.

6180
04:11:00,960 --> 04:11:04,620
I am here today because whatever, 30,000 years ago,

6181
04:11:04,620 --> 04:11:07,890
some Neanderthal had the same realization

6182
04:11:07,890 --> 04:11:09,208
that I should procreate

6183
04:11:09,208 --> 04:11:11,628
and I should continue my bloodline.

6184
04:11:11,628 --> 04:11:15,150
And that that all amounts to me sitting here now.

6185
04:11:15,150 --> 04:11:19,530
But it didn't become a practical reality to me

6186
04:11:19,530 --> 04:11:21,840
before meeting the right woman.

6187
04:11:21,840 --> 04:11:24,420
And I think that that's sometimes

6188
04:11:24,420 --> 04:11:26,670
not part of the conversation enough

6189
04:11:26,670 --> 04:11:28,980
that there's something broken at the moment

6190
04:11:28,980 --> 04:11:33,360
about how people pair up in the western world.

6191
04:11:33,360 --> 04:11:35,340
And it's at the source of why

6192
04:11:35,340 --> 04:11:36,810
we're not having enough children

6193
04:11:36,810 --> 04:11:38,610
because there's not enough couples,

6194
04:11:38,610 --> 04:11:40,110
there's not enough marriage.

6195
04:11:40,110 --> 04:11:41,640
There's not a lot of these...

6196
04:11:41,640 --> 04:11:44,100
There's not enough of all these traditional values

6197
04:11:44,100 --> 04:11:47,160
that even 50, 60, 70 years ago

6198
04:11:47,160 --> 04:11:49,410
was just taken for granted.

6199
04:11:49,410 --> 04:11:52,440
We're in this grand experiment

6200
04:11:52,440 --> 04:11:56,070
of what happens if we just remove a bunch of institutions?

6201
04:11:56,070 --> 04:11:58,920
What happens if we no longer value marriage

6202
04:11:58,920 --> 04:12:02,017
as a something to aspire to?

6203
04:12:02,017 --> 04:12:07,017
What happened if parenthood is now seen in some camps?

6204
04:12:07,140 --> 04:12:09,630
It's almost something like weird

6205
04:12:09,630 --> 04:12:11,787
or against your own self-expression.

6206
04:12:11,787 --> 04:12:13,470
It's a grand experiment

6207
04:12:13,470 --> 04:12:17,342
that I'm kind of curious how it turns out.

6208
04:12:17,342 --> 04:12:19,106
I prefer to watch it as a movie

6209
04:12:19,106 --> 04:12:21,630
like the "Children of Men," I'm like, that was a good show.

6210
04:12:21,630 --> 04:12:23,760
I kind of wish that wasn't reality.

6211
04:12:23,760 --> 04:12:25,740
But we're seeing that reality play out

6212
04:12:25,740 --> 04:12:29,939
while I'm sitting here in a very traditional

6213
04:12:29,939 --> 04:12:33,780
two parent loving household with three children,

6214
04:12:33,780 --> 04:12:37,660
and going, this is now at the top.

6215
04:12:37,660 --> 04:12:39,707
I've done a lot of things in my life.

6216
04:12:39,707 --> 04:12:43,110
I've built software, I've built companies,

6217
04:12:43,110 --> 04:12:45,270
I've raced cars, I've done all sorts of things,

6218
04:12:45,270 --> 04:12:49,918
and I would trade all of it in a heartbeat for my kids.

6219
04:12:49,918 --> 04:12:52,927
That's just a really fascinating human experience

6220
04:12:52,927 --> 04:12:56,250
that the depth of that bond

6221
04:12:56,250 --> 04:13:00,390
is something you can't appreciate before you have it.

6222
04:13:00,390 --> 04:13:05,390
But I also think there is a role to play, to talk it up.

6223
04:13:05,910 --> 04:13:08,820
Because we're being bombarded constantly

6224
04:13:08,820 --> 04:13:11,130
with reasons why not to.

6225
04:13:11,130 --> 04:13:13,053
Oh, it's too expensive.

6226
04:13:14,430 --> 04:13:17,310
Well, you could get divorced and then you might lose half.

6227
04:13:17,310 --> 04:13:19,740
There's all these voices

6228
04:13:19,740 --> 04:13:22,560
constantly articulating the case against marriage,

6229
04:13:22,560 --> 04:13:25,000
the case against having children

6230
04:13:26,166 --> 04:13:30,892
that those of us who've chosen to do the traditional thing

6231
04:13:30,892 --> 04:13:34,470
to get married and to have children have an obligation

6232
04:13:34,470 --> 04:13:36,330
to kind of talk it up a little bit,

6233
04:13:36,330 --> 04:13:38,610
which would've seen ridiculous again 50 years ago

6234
04:13:38,610 --> 04:13:40,300
that you'd have to talk up

6235
04:13:40,300 --> 04:13:42,264
something so fundamental of that.

6236
04:13:42,264 --> 04:13:47,160
But I have become kind of obligated

6237
04:13:47,160 --> 04:13:48,810
in that sense to do just that.

6238
04:13:48,810 --> 04:13:51,297
To talk it up, to say, you know what?

6239
04:13:51,297 --> 04:13:53,380
You can look at everything that I've done

6240
04:13:53,380 --> 04:13:55,620
and if you like some of those parts

6241
04:13:55,620 --> 04:13:58,833
realize that to me in this situation,

6242
04:14:00,703 --> 04:14:02,760
the kids, the family, the wife

6243
04:14:02,760 --> 04:14:03,900
is more important than all of it.

6244
04:14:03,900 --> 04:14:05,310
And it sounds like a cliche

6245
04:14:05,310 --> 04:14:07,470
because you've heard it a thousand times before.

6246
04:14:07,470 --> 04:14:09,274
And by becoming a cliche,

6247
04:14:09,274 --> 04:14:11,460
maybe you start believing it's not true

6248
04:14:11,460 --> 04:14:16,290
that it's just something people say, but it is reality.

6249
04:14:16,290 --> 04:14:17,940
I know almost no parents

6250
04:14:17,940 --> 04:14:20,250
that I have personal relationships with

6251
04:14:20,250 --> 04:14:21,750
that don't consider their children

6252
04:14:21,750 --> 04:14:23,790
to be the most important thing in their life.

6253
04:14:23,790 --> 04:14:25,590
- So there's a lot of interesting things you said.

6254
04:14:25,590 --> 04:14:27,769
So one, it does seem to be,

6255
04:14:27,769 --> 04:14:32,070
I know a lot of parents,

6256
04:14:32,070 --> 04:14:33,330
perhaps more interestingly,

6257
04:14:33,330 --> 04:14:37,410
I know a lot of super successful people who are parents

6258
04:14:37,410 --> 04:14:42,000
who really love their kids

6259
04:14:42,000 --> 04:14:44,670
and who say that the kids even help them

6260
04:14:44,670 --> 04:14:46,560
to be more successful.

6261
04:14:46,560 --> 04:14:48,270
Now the interesting thing,

6262
04:14:48,270 --> 04:14:49,470
speaking to what you're saying

6263
04:14:49,470 --> 04:14:52,620
is it does seem for us humans,

6264
04:14:52,620 --> 04:14:55,450
it's easier to articulate the negatives

6265
04:14:56,340 --> 04:14:58,650
because they're sort of concrete, pragmatic, you know,

6266
04:14:58,650 --> 04:15:01,722
it costs more, it takes some time, you know,

6267
04:15:01,722 --> 04:15:03,810
they can be, you know, crying all over the place.

6268
04:15:03,810 --> 04:15:06,270
They're, you know, tiny narcissists

6269
04:15:06,270 --> 04:15:07,696
running around or whatever.

6270
04:15:07,696 --> 04:15:08,529
- Which is all true.

6271
04:15:08,529 --> 04:15:10,990
- Yeah, pooping everywhere, that kind of stuff.

6272
04:15:10,990 --> 04:15:15,090
But to articulate the thing you were speaking to

6273
04:15:15,090 --> 04:15:17,250
of there's this little creature

6274
04:15:17,250 --> 04:15:18,630
that you love more than anything

6275
04:15:18,630 --> 04:15:19,860
you've ever loved in your life.

6276
04:15:19,860 --> 04:15:22,260
It's hard to convert that into words.

6277
04:15:22,260 --> 04:15:23,610
You have to really experience it.

6278
04:15:23,610 --> 04:15:27,421
But I believe it and I want to experience that,

6279
04:15:27,421 --> 04:15:31,170
but I believe 'cause just from a scientific method,

6280
04:15:31,170 --> 04:15:33,420
have seen a lot of people

6281
04:15:33,420 --> 04:15:36,033
who are not honestly not very capable of love,

6282
04:15:36,960 --> 04:15:39,242
fall completely in love with their kids.

6283
04:15:39,242 --> 04:15:41,940
Like, you know, very sort of...

6284
04:15:41,940 --> 04:15:44,100
let's just call it what it is, engineers

6285
04:15:44,100 --> 04:15:46,094
that are very like boop bop.

6286
04:15:46,094 --> 04:15:48,480
They just fall in love.

6287
04:15:48,480 --> 04:15:52,380
And it's like, all right, people who just like you said,

6288
04:15:52,380 --> 04:15:55,042
they don't really want, they don't really care

6289
04:15:55,042 --> 04:15:58,260
or don't really think about having kids that kind of stuff

6290
04:15:58,260 --> 04:15:59,840
once they do it changes everything.

6291
04:15:59,840 --> 04:16:03,445
So, you know, but it's hard to convert it into words.

6292
04:16:03,445 --> 04:16:04,820
- One of the reasons I think

6293
04:16:04,820 --> 04:16:08,505
is also difficult is, I mean, I like kids.

6294
04:16:08,505 --> 04:16:10,623
Not that I actively disliked them,

6295
04:16:11,550 --> 04:16:14,040
but when I was around other people's kids,

6296
04:16:14,040 --> 04:16:15,733
I didn't have a emotional reaction.

6297
04:16:15,733 --> 04:16:17,460
Some women have, right?

6298
04:16:17,460 --> 04:16:19,219
They see a baby and they go, "Oh."

6299
04:16:19,219 --> 04:16:21,307
I never had any emotion of that.

6300
04:16:21,307 --> 04:16:22,650
I mean, I could appreciate,

6301
04:16:22,650 --> 04:16:24,240
I'm glad for you that you have children.

6302
04:16:24,240 --> 04:16:25,953
It did not provoke anything in me.

6303
04:16:27,270 --> 04:16:28,130
The emotions that are provoked in me

6304
04:16:28,130 --> 04:16:30,342
when I look at my own children,

6305
04:16:30,342 --> 04:16:32,490
this doesn't exist in the same universe.

6306
04:16:32,490 --> 04:16:33,450
So you don't have something,

6307
04:16:33,450 --> 04:16:34,800
you don't have a complete parallel,

6308
04:16:34,800 --> 04:16:35,880
or at least a lot of men,

6309
04:16:35,880 --> 04:16:38,760
or at least me, I didn't have sort of a framework

6310
04:16:38,760 --> 04:16:41,880
to put it into what would it be like to have my own child?

6311
04:16:41,880 --> 04:16:43,530
And then you experience it.

6312
04:16:43,530 --> 04:16:44,913
It's like the poof.

6313
04:16:45,750 --> 04:16:47,700
And it happens so quickly too.

6314
04:16:47,700 --> 04:16:49,350
This is what I found fascinating.

6315
04:16:49,350 --> 04:16:51,990
It happens before that little human

6316
04:16:51,990 --> 04:16:55,443
is even able to return any words to you

6317
04:16:55,443 --> 04:16:59,800
that the love you develop to an infant,

6318
04:16:59,800 --> 04:17:01,080
it happens quite quickly.

6319
04:17:01,080 --> 04:17:04,080
Not necessarily immediately, I don't know,

6320
04:17:04,080 --> 04:17:05,940
different people have different experiences,

6321
04:17:05,940 --> 04:17:07,973
but it took me a little bit.

6322
04:17:07,973 --> 04:17:12,540
But then once it hit, it just hit like kick of a horse.

6323
04:17:12,540 --> 04:17:17,540
And I love that it's also just such a universal experience.

6324
04:17:17,760 --> 04:17:20,273
That you can be the most successful person in the world.

6325
04:17:20,273 --> 04:17:21,683
You can be the poorest person in the world.

6326
04:17:21,683 --> 04:17:23,910
You can be somewhere in the middle.

6327
04:17:23,910 --> 04:17:28,134
And we share this experience that being a parent,

6328
04:17:28,134 --> 04:17:30,150
for most of them,

6329
04:17:30,150 --> 04:17:33,090
turns out to be the most important thing in their life.

6330
04:17:33,090 --> 04:17:35,074
- But you know, it is really nice

6331
04:17:35,074 --> 04:17:38,220
to do that kind of experience with the right partner.

6332
04:17:38,220 --> 04:17:40,380
But I think because I'm such an empath,

6333
04:17:40,380 --> 04:17:43,830
the cost of having the wrong partner is high for me.

6334
04:17:43,830 --> 04:17:46,680
But then I also like realized, man,

6335
04:17:46,680 --> 04:17:49,980
I have a friend of mine who's divorced happily

6336
04:17:49,980 --> 04:17:51,840
and he still loves the shit out of his kids.

6337
04:17:51,840 --> 04:17:53,219
And it's still beautiful.

6338
04:17:53,219 --> 04:17:56,399
It's a mess, but there's all of that love is still there

6339
04:17:56,399 --> 04:17:59,460
and it's, you know, you just have to make it work.

6340
04:17:59,460 --> 04:18:00,720
It's just that, I don't know,

6341
04:18:00,720 --> 04:18:02,760
that kind of like divorce would destroy me.

6342
04:18:02,760 --> 04:18:05,430
- You should listen to The School of Life.

6343
04:18:05,430 --> 04:18:09,030
He has this great bit on YouTube.

6344
04:18:09,030 --> 04:18:11,160
You'll marry the wrong person.

6345
04:18:11,160 --> 04:18:14,310
If you accept upfront that you will marry the wrong person,

6346
04:18:14,310 --> 04:18:17,340
that every potential person you can marry

6347
04:18:17,340 --> 04:18:19,680
is gonna be the wrong person on some dimension.

6348
04:18:19,680 --> 04:18:20,880
They're gonna annoy you.

6349
04:18:20,880 --> 04:18:25,020
They're gonna be not what you hoped in certain dimensions.

6350
04:18:25,020 --> 04:18:26,460
The romantic ideal

6351
04:18:26,460 --> 04:18:29,040
that everything is just perfect all the time

6352
04:18:29,040 --> 04:18:31,740
is not very conducive to the reality

6353
04:18:31,740 --> 04:18:35,100
of hitching up and get making babies.

6354
04:18:35,100 --> 04:18:38,160
Because I think as you just accounted,

6355
04:18:38,160 --> 04:18:39,843
even when it turns to shit,

6356
04:18:41,310 --> 04:18:44,970
I find that most of the people I personally know

6357
04:18:44,970 --> 04:18:46,110
where things have fallen apart

6358
04:18:46,110 --> 04:18:47,803
and have turned to shit,

6359
04:18:47,803 --> 04:18:51,063
never in a million years would they go like, "I regret it."

6360
04:18:51,063 --> 04:18:53,460
"I would rather, my children did not exist

6361
04:18:53,460 --> 04:18:57,480
because a relationship turned sour."

6362
04:18:57,480 --> 04:18:59,100
I mean, I think you should try very hard.

6363
04:18:59,100 --> 04:19:00,570
And I think this is also one of those things

6364
04:19:00,570 --> 04:19:04,650
where we didn't fully understand those fences.

6365
04:19:04,650 --> 04:19:05,790
And when we pulled them up

6366
04:19:05,790 --> 04:19:09,543
and celebrated how easy it is to get divorced, for example,

6367
04:19:09,543 --> 04:19:12,240
that that wasn't gonna have some negative consequences.

6368
04:19:12,240 --> 04:19:13,830
I'm not saying you shouldn't have divorces.

6369
04:19:13,830 --> 04:19:17,100
I'm not saying return to times past.

6370
04:19:17,100 --> 04:19:19,860
I'm saying though that civilization

6371
04:19:19,860 --> 04:19:23,430
over thousands of years developed certain technologies

6372
04:19:23,430 --> 04:19:28,355
for ensuring the continuation of its own institutions

6373
04:19:28,355 --> 04:19:31,198
and its own life that perhaps we didn't fully appreciate.

6374
04:19:31,198 --> 04:19:33,941
I mean, again, this is something Jordan Peterson

6375
04:19:33,941 --> 04:19:36,774
and others are far more articulate to speak about,

6376
04:19:36,774 --> 04:19:38,700
and that I've learned a lot

6377
04:19:38,700 --> 04:19:41,160
to just analyze my own situation.

6378
04:19:41,160 --> 04:19:43,500
Why is it that this incredible burden,

6379
04:19:43,500 --> 04:19:46,594
it is to be responsible for someone else's life

6380
04:19:46,594 --> 04:19:48,730
that you brought into this world

6381
04:19:48,730 --> 04:19:52,920
is also the most rewarding part of existence?

6382
04:19:52,920 --> 04:19:54,660
That's just curious.

6383
04:19:54,660 --> 04:19:57,143
Before I heard Peterson articulate the value

6384
04:19:57,143 --> 04:20:02,143
of taking on the greatest burden you know how to carry,

6385
04:20:02,910 --> 04:20:05,700
I always thought about burdens as a negative things.

6386
04:20:05,700 --> 04:20:08,310
Why would I want the burden of a child?

6387
04:20:08,310 --> 04:20:09,253
I might screw it up.

6388
04:20:09,253 --> 04:20:11,610
I might be a bad parent.

6389
04:20:11,610 --> 04:20:14,094
They might have bad... all this stuff, right?

6390
04:20:14,094 --> 04:20:16,680
All the reasons why you shouldn't.

6391
04:20:16,680 --> 04:20:21,240
And so few voices articulating why you should.

6392
04:20:21,240 --> 04:20:23,130
- Yeah, but there I should also add

6393
04:20:23,130 --> 04:20:24,630
on top of that thing you mentioned

6394
04:20:24,630 --> 04:20:26,340
currently, perhaps in the west,

6395
04:20:26,340 --> 04:20:28,897
the matchmaking process is broken.

6396
04:20:28,897 --> 04:20:30,550
Is broken and technology made it worse.

6397
04:20:30,550 --> 04:20:31,920
Yeah, it's fascinating.

6398
04:20:31,920 --> 04:20:35,370
This whole thing that that hasn't been solved.

6399
04:20:35,370 --> 04:20:37,410
So hiring great teams,

6400
04:20:37,410 --> 04:20:41,702
that's probably been solved the best out of matchmaking.

6401
04:20:41,702 --> 04:20:44,410
Finding great people to hire.

6402
04:20:44,410 --> 04:20:47,490
Second, finding great friends.

6403
04:20:47,490 --> 04:20:49,800
That's like, that's also hasn't been solved.

6404
04:20:49,800 --> 04:20:51,960
- And it's breaking down. - It's breaking down.

6405
04:20:51,960 --> 04:20:53,070
And third is matchmaking

6406
04:20:53,070 --> 04:20:54,480
for like relationships.

6407
04:20:54,480 --> 04:20:56,040
That's like the worst.

6408
04:20:56,040 --> 04:20:58,560
And in fact, technology made it even worse.

6409
04:20:58,560 --> 04:20:59,520
It's fascinating.

6410
04:20:59,520 --> 04:21:00,353
- It is.

6411
04:21:00,353 --> 04:21:01,560
It's a great example again

6412
04:21:01,560 --> 04:21:04,920
of how all the greatest intentions

6413
04:21:04,920 --> 04:21:06,810
still led us straight to hell.

6414
04:21:06,810 --> 04:21:09,802
I really enjoyed Louis Perry's analysis

6415
04:21:09,802 --> 04:21:14,550
of the sexual revolution not being an unqualified good,

6416
04:21:14,550 --> 04:21:17,130
which was something I hadn't thought about at all

6417
04:21:17,130 --> 04:21:18,780
before she articulated it.

6418
04:21:18,780 --> 04:21:21,510
That of course women

6419
04:21:21,510 --> 04:21:24,504
should be able to have freedom and self determination

6420
04:21:24,504 --> 04:21:26,880
and abortions and all of these things.

6421
04:21:26,880 --> 04:21:29,700
And Louise Perry is not arguing

6422
04:21:29,700 --> 04:21:30,960
against that either, of course.

6423
04:21:30,960 --> 04:21:33,445
But there are second order facts

6424
04:21:33,445 --> 04:21:35,820
that we don't appreciate at the time

6425
04:21:35,820 --> 04:21:38,757
and we may not have ready-made solutions for.

6426
04:21:38,757 --> 04:21:40,290
And that's just interesting.

6427
04:21:40,290 --> 04:21:43,710
You make life better in a million different ways

6428
04:21:43,710 --> 04:21:45,930
and somehow we end up more miserable.

6429
04:21:45,930 --> 04:21:46,980
Why is that?

6430
04:21:46,980 --> 04:21:51,745
Why is it that humans find meaning in hardship?

6431
04:21:51,745 --> 04:21:56,730
And I think some of that

6432
04:21:56,730 --> 04:21:59,790
is that it's a difficult question

6433
04:21:59,790 --> 04:22:03,090
to answers through science.

6434
04:22:03,090 --> 04:22:05,637
And again, Peterson articulates well

6435
04:22:05,637 --> 04:22:08,054
this idea that you have to find some of it through art,

6436
04:22:08,054 --> 04:22:10,500
some of it through authors,

6437
04:22:10,500 --> 04:22:13,250
some of it through different...

6438
04:22:14,100 --> 04:22:15,675
I was just about to say modes of knowing

6439
04:22:15,675 --> 04:22:17,658
before I stopped myself,

6440
04:22:17,658 --> 04:22:20,220
because that sounds like woo bullshit.

6441
04:22:20,220 --> 04:22:22,200
But there are different ways

6442
04:22:22,200 --> 04:22:27,200
to acquire those deep lessons

6443
04:22:27,503 --> 04:22:32,503
that sort of paper is not gonna tell you.

6444
04:22:32,903 --> 04:22:34,996
- I mean, this is really,

6445
04:22:34,996 --> 04:22:39,540
the point also applies to religion, for example.

6446
04:22:39,540 --> 04:22:43,080
If you remove from society the software of religion,

6447
04:22:43,080 --> 04:22:45,210
you better have a good replacement.

6448
04:22:45,210 --> 04:22:47,880
- And we've had a bunch of bad replacements,

6449
04:22:47,880 --> 04:22:50,970
especially over the last few decades.

6450
04:22:50,970 --> 04:22:53,010
Religion is one of those things I've struggled with a lot

6451
04:22:53,010 --> 04:22:55,077
because I'm not religious.

6452
04:22:55,077 --> 04:22:57,480
I sort of wish I was.

6453
04:22:57,480 --> 04:23:02,480
I can now fully appreciate the enormous value

6454
04:23:03,271 --> 04:23:06,780
having an operating system like that

6455
04:23:06,780 --> 04:23:08,625
brings not just at the individual level,

6456
04:23:08,625 --> 04:23:11,700
but rather at a societal level.

6457
04:23:11,700 --> 04:23:13,740
And it's not clear at all what the answer is.

6458
04:23:13,740 --> 04:23:16,200
I think we've tried a lot of dead ends

6459
04:23:16,200 --> 04:23:17,730
when it came to replacements

6460
04:23:17,730 --> 04:23:19,800
and people have been filling that void

6461
04:23:19,800 --> 04:23:22,340
in a million different ways that seem worse

6462
04:23:22,340 --> 04:23:23,760
than all the religions,

6463
04:23:23,760 --> 04:23:26,626
despite their faults in a myriad of ways

6464
04:23:26,626 --> 04:23:28,950
have been able to deliver.

6465
04:23:28,950 --> 04:23:32,643
- Yeah, religions like the cobalt code.

6466
04:23:32,643 --> 04:23:33,873
It's just... - Yes,

6467
04:23:34,740 --> 04:23:35,940
it's the institutions

6468
04:23:35,940 --> 04:23:37,500
where we don't fully understand the rules

6469
04:23:37,500 --> 04:23:38,340
and why they're there

6470
04:23:38,340 --> 04:23:40,050
and what's gonna happen if we remove them.

6471
04:23:40,050 --> 04:23:42,720
Yeah, some of them seems obvious to me

6472
04:23:42,720 --> 04:23:45,720
are just bullshit of the time.

6473
04:23:45,720 --> 04:23:47,790
Oh, you should need whatever shellfish,

6474
04:23:47,790 --> 04:23:49,500
because in that region of the world.

6475
04:23:49,500 --> 04:23:51,720
There was something, something, something, okay, fine.

6476
04:23:51,720 --> 04:23:53,610
But there's a bunch of other things

6477
04:23:53,610 --> 04:23:56,547
that are pivotal to keeping society functioning

6478
04:23:56,547 --> 04:23:57,570
for the long term,

6479
04:23:57,570 --> 04:24:00,210
and we don't fully understand which is which.

6480
04:24:00,210 --> 04:24:01,290
What's the bullshit

6481
04:24:01,290 --> 04:24:04,170
and what's the load-bearing pillars of society.

6482
04:24:04,170 --> 04:24:08,160
- Can you speak to the hit on productivity that kids have?

6483
04:24:09,270 --> 04:24:11,380
Did they increase your productivity, decrease it,

6484
04:24:11,380 --> 04:24:13,680
or is that even the wrong question to ask?

6485
04:24:13,680 --> 04:24:14,850
- I think it's one of the reasons

6486
04:24:14,850 --> 04:24:18,570
why ambitious people are often afraid of having children

6487
04:24:18,570 --> 04:24:20,670
because they think I have so much more to do

6488
04:24:20,670 --> 04:24:22,380
and I barely have enough time now.

6489
04:24:22,380 --> 04:24:25,560
How would I possibly be able to accomplish the things

6490
04:24:25,560 --> 04:24:29,487
I wanna accomplish if I add another human into the mix?

6491
04:24:29,487 --> 04:24:34,487
Now, A, we've always worked 40 hours a week,

6492
04:24:35,220 --> 04:24:37,860
not 80 or 100 or 120.

6493
04:24:37,860 --> 04:24:39,420
I think that's very beneficial.

6494
04:24:39,420 --> 04:24:43,980
B, kids don't exist in this vacuum

6495
04:24:43,980 --> 04:24:46,110
of just them alone being entered into your life.

6496
04:24:46,110 --> 04:24:48,120
Hopefully there's a partner.

6497
04:24:48,120 --> 04:24:52,290
And in my life, I'm married to a wonderful woman

6498
04:24:52,290 --> 04:24:55,719
who decided to stop working her corporate job

6499
04:24:55,719 --> 04:24:57,608
when we got together

6500
04:24:57,608 --> 04:24:59,413
and have been able to carry

6501
04:24:59,413 --> 04:25:02,526
a huge part of that responsibility.

6502
04:25:02,526 --> 04:25:04,410
I was just about to say burden.

6503
04:25:04,410 --> 04:25:07,980
And I think that's exactly how it often gets presented,

6504
04:25:07,980 --> 04:25:10,557
especially from a feminist perspective,

6505
04:25:10,557 --> 04:25:13,034
that carrying for your own children

6506
04:25:13,034 --> 04:25:15,832
is some sort of unpaid labor

6507
04:25:15,832 --> 04:25:20,832
that has to be compensated for in some specific way

6508
04:25:21,060 --> 04:25:22,680
beyond the compensation

6509
04:25:22,680 --> 04:25:25,272
of what bringing life into this world,

6510
04:25:25,272 --> 04:25:28,530
racing wonderful humans.

6511
04:25:28,530 --> 04:25:31,830
There's something screwy about that analysis

6512
04:25:31,830 --> 04:25:35,760
that I actually think the modern trad movement

6513
04:25:35,760 --> 04:25:38,430
is a reply against.

6514
04:25:38,430 --> 04:25:39,690
Whether they have all the answers,

6515
04:25:39,690 --> 04:25:41,130
I'm certainly not sure of either.

6516
04:25:41,130 --> 04:25:44,010
But there's something that's just not right

6517
04:25:44,010 --> 04:25:47,010
in the analysis that children are a burden

6518
04:25:47,010 --> 04:25:52,010
and that if woman chooses to stay at home with the kids,

6519
04:25:53,370 --> 04:25:57,268
that that some sort of failure mode of feminist ambition.

6520
04:25:57,268 --> 04:26:00,270
I think that's actually a complete dead end.

6521
04:26:00,270 --> 04:26:03,210
Now depends on different people, different circumstances.

6522
04:26:03,210 --> 04:26:06,000
I can just speak to my life

6523
04:26:06,000 --> 04:26:07,710
being married to a wonderful woman

6524
04:26:07,710 --> 04:26:11,880
who have decided to be home with the kids,

6525
04:26:11,880 --> 04:26:14,790
at least at their early age

6526
04:26:14,790 --> 04:26:17,850
and taking on a lot of those responsibilities.

6527
04:26:17,850 --> 04:26:20,670
Now it doesn't mean there isn't plenty of ways

6528
04:26:20,670 --> 04:26:24,090
that I have to be part of that and have to chip in,

6529
04:26:24,090 --> 04:26:25,470
but it's allowed me to continue

6530
04:26:25,470 --> 04:26:30,130
to work the 40 hours a week that I've always worked.

6531
04:26:30,130 --> 04:26:33,300
But it's made the 40 hours more strict.

6532
04:26:33,300 --> 04:26:38,064
I have a schedule where I wake up, whatever, 6:30

6533
04:26:38,064 --> 04:26:41,610
and we have to get out of the door a little before 8:00.

6534
04:26:41,610 --> 04:26:42,690
I usually have to play

6535
04:26:42,690 --> 04:26:44,880
at least one or two rounds of "Fortnite"

6536
04:26:44,880 --> 04:26:48,510
with my youngest and sometimes middle child.

6537
04:26:48,510 --> 04:26:50,580
Then take the kids to school,

6538
04:26:50,580 --> 04:26:54,515
get in, start work at, I don't know, 8:39.

6539
04:26:54,515 --> 04:26:58,800
Didn't work until 5:00, 5:30, sometimes six o'clock.

6540
04:26:58,800 --> 04:27:01,800
But then it's dinner and I have to be there for that.

6541
04:27:01,800 --> 04:27:03,240
And then I have to read to the kids

6542
04:27:03,240 --> 04:27:05,520
and by the time that's done,

6543
04:27:05,520 --> 04:27:06,990
I don't want to go back to work.

6544
04:27:06,990 --> 04:27:11,990
So my work time really is 9:00 to 5:00, 9:00 to 6:00,

6545
04:27:12,750 --> 04:27:14,199
depending of whatever is going on.

6546
04:27:14,199 --> 04:27:15,251
Sometimes there's emergencies

6547
04:27:15,251 --> 04:27:16,740
and you have to tend to them,

6548
04:27:16,740 --> 04:27:18,630
but it's made it more structured.

6549
04:27:18,630 --> 04:27:21,310
And I found some benefit in that

6550
04:27:21,310 --> 04:27:23,670
and I've found some productivity in that,

6551
04:27:23,670 --> 04:27:26,250
that I can't goof around quite as much

6552
04:27:26,250 --> 04:27:30,390
that the day will end at around 5:36.

6553
04:27:30,390 --> 04:27:31,890
That's just if I didn't accomplish

6554
04:27:31,890 --> 04:27:33,300
what I wanted to do today,

6555
04:27:33,300 --> 04:27:35,040
if I get to that time, it's done.

6556
04:27:35,040 --> 04:27:38,365
I'm over, I have to try again tomorrow.

6557
04:27:38,365 --> 04:27:41,670
Whereas before having a family and before having kids,

6558
04:27:41,670 --> 04:27:43,407
I could just like not do it

6559
04:27:43,407 --> 04:27:45,519
and just make it up in the evening.

6560
04:27:45,519 --> 04:27:48,270
So in that way it's made me more structured,

6561
04:27:48,270 --> 04:27:49,470
but it hasn't really changed

6562
04:27:49,470 --> 04:27:51,390
my volume of work all that much.

6563
04:27:51,390 --> 04:27:53,460
I still work about the same amount of hours.

6564
04:27:53,460 --> 04:27:55,140
And that's, by the way, enough.

6565
04:27:55,140 --> 04:27:58,382
This is one of the key points we make in.

6566
04:27:58,382 --> 04:28:00,300
It doesn't have to be crazy at work.

6567
04:28:00,300 --> 04:28:02,770
The latest book we wrote is that there's enough time.

6568
04:28:02,770 --> 04:28:05,820
40 hours a week is actually a ton

6569
04:28:05,820 --> 04:28:07,560
if you don't piss it away.

6570
04:28:07,560 --> 04:28:09,090
Most people do piss it away.

6571
04:28:09,090 --> 04:28:10,260
They piss it away in meetings.

6572
04:28:10,260 --> 04:28:13,680
They piss it away on just stuff that doesn't matter

6573
04:28:13,680 --> 04:28:17,580
when even three hours, four hours

6574
04:28:17,580 --> 04:28:21,261
of concentrated uninterrupted time every day

6575
04:28:21,261 --> 04:28:24,012
would move to goals they truly care about

6576
04:28:24,012 --> 04:28:26,176
way down the field.

6577
04:28:26,176 --> 04:28:28,680
- I think kids do make you more productive

6578
04:28:28,680 --> 04:28:30,120
in that way for people who need it,

6579
04:28:30,120 --> 04:28:32,071
especially people like me.

6580
04:28:32,071 --> 04:28:33,780
They create their urgency.

6581
04:28:33,780 --> 04:28:37,577
Lik if you have to be done by 5:00,

6582
04:28:37,577 --> 04:28:39,690
it's a maybe counterintuitive notion,

6583
04:28:39,690 --> 04:28:42,783
but for people like me who like to work,

6584
04:28:43,830 --> 04:28:48,830
you can really fill the day with fluff of work.

6585
04:28:50,427 --> 04:28:53,295
And if you have to be done by 5:00,

6586
04:28:53,295 --> 04:28:57,490
you're going to have to do the deep work and get it done.

6587
04:28:57,490 --> 04:29:00,056
Like really focus singular work.

6588
04:29:00,056 --> 04:29:02,080
And then you're just gonna cut off all the pressure.

6589
04:29:02,080 --> 04:29:03,000
- It keeps you honest.

6590
04:29:03,000 --> 04:29:06,960
It keeps you honest because you can squander one day,

6591
04:29:06,960 --> 04:29:07,980
you can squander two days.

6592
04:29:07,980 --> 04:29:12,900
But if I squander a whole week, I feel terrible.

6593
04:29:12,900 --> 04:29:15,210
Now that's just some drive I have in me

6594
04:29:15,210 --> 04:29:17,880
where I feel content and full meaning

6595
04:29:17,880 --> 04:29:20,220
if I actually do stuff that matters,

6596
04:29:20,220 --> 04:29:21,810
if I can look back upon the week

6597
04:29:21,810 --> 04:29:23,650
and go like that was a nice week, really.

6598
04:29:23,650 --> 04:29:24,690
We moved forward.

6599
04:29:24,690 --> 04:29:25,530
Maybe we didn't get done,

6600
04:29:25,530 --> 04:29:28,215
but we moved forward and everything got better.

6601
04:29:28,215 --> 04:29:30,030
And I think kids really helped

6602
04:29:30,030 --> 04:29:32,322
just time box things in that way.

6603
04:29:32,322 --> 04:29:34,260
And a lot of people need that

6604
04:29:34,260 --> 04:29:37,850
because I find just so much of the celebration

6605
04:29:40,117 --> 04:29:43,140
of overwork to be so tiresome.

6606
04:29:43,140 --> 04:29:46,710
Oh, I work 60 hours or 80 hours or 100 hours a week

6607
04:29:46,710 --> 04:29:49,138
and just like, first of all, no, you don't.

6608
04:29:49,138 --> 04:29:50,550
No, you don't.

6609
04:29:50,550 --> 04:29:52,260
Like those 80 hours are full

6610
04:29:52,260 --> 04:29:55,223
of all sorts of fluff that you label work,

6611
04:29:55,223 --> 04:29:56,820
but that I would laugh at

6612
04:29:56,820 --> 04:29:58,203
and that most people laugh at.

6613
04:29:58,203 --> 04:30:01,050
That you would laugh at if you actually did the analysis

6614
04:30:01,050 --> 04:30:03,270
of where's that time going.

6615
04:30:03,270 --> 04:30:06,180
Most of the important stuff that has to be done

6616
04:30:06,180 --> 04:30:08,340
is done in these uninterrupted chunks

6617
04:30:08,340 --> 04:30:10,797
of two hours here or four hours there or five hours there.

6618
04:30:10,797 --> 04:30:12,360
The hard part is making sure

6619
04:30:12,360 --> 04:30:13,983
you get them in the whole piece.

6620
04:30:15,300 --> 04:30:17,490
So don't give me that.

6621
04:30:17,490 --> 04:30:18,390
There's time enough.

6622
04:30:18,390 --> 04:30:23,160
And also what's so important that it ranks

6623
04:30:23,160 --> 04:30:25,846
above continuing your lineage.

6624
04:30:25,846 --> 04:30:30,660
I think there's just some ancient honor

6625
04:30:30,660 --> 04:30:31,891
in the fact that, again,

6626
04:30:31,891 --> 04:30:34,800
this DNA that's sitting on this chair

6627
04:30:34,800 --> 04:30:38,280
traveled 30,000 years to get here

6628
04:30:38,280 --> 04:30:39,720
and you're gonna squander all that away

6629
04:30:39,720 --> 04:30:41,880
just so you can send a few more emails.

6630
04:30:41,880 --> 04:30:43,080
- There is something that's also hard

6631
04:30:43,080 --> 04:30:47,130
to convert into words of just the kind of fun

6632
04:30:47,130 --> 04:30:49,680
you can have just playing with your kids.

6633
04:30:49,680 --> 04:30:52,620
I don't know what that on the surface it's like,

6634
04:30:52,620 --> 04:30:53,670
I can have that kind of fun

6635
04:30:53,670 --> 04:30:55,080
just playing video games by myself.

6636
04:30:55,080 --> 04:30:58,170
But no, it's like there's something magical about it, right?

6637
04:30:58,170 --> 04:31:01,576
- I have a thousand hours logged in "Fortnite"

6638
04:31:01,576 --> 04:31:04,683
since 19, I think,

6639
04:31:06,210 --> 04:31:07,890
all of it with my kids.

6640
04:31:07,890 --> 04:31:09,270
I'd never be playing "Fortnite."

6641
04:31:09,270 --> 04:31:10,650
Well, I don't know if I never would be.

6642
04:31:10,650 --> 04:31:12,750
I wouldn't be playing a thousand hours of "Fortnite"

6643
04:31:12,750 --> 04:31:13,920
if it wasn't for my kids.

6644
04:31:13,920 --> 04:31:16,890
The enjoyment for me is to do

6645
04:31:16,890 --> 04:31:19,470
something with them that I also happen to enjoy.

6646
04:31:19,470 --> 04:31:20,550
I really love "Fortnite."

6647
04:31:20,550 --> 04:31:22,770
It's a phenomenal game.

6648
04:31:22,770 --> 04:31:24,840
I don't have to force myself to play that with them.

6649
04:31:24,840 --> 04:31:27,897
I often ask like, hey, do you wanna play "Fortnite?"

6650
04:31:29,040 --> 04:31:31,590
But still, it's an activity that I get to share with them.

6651
04:31:31,590 --> 04:31:33,240
It's a passion that I get to share with them.

6652
04:31:33,240 --> 04:31:36,254
I've started doing go-karting with my oldest.

6653
04:31:36,254 --> 04:31:38,155
I've been driving race cars for a long time

6654
04:31:38,155 --> 04:31:39,810
and now they're getting into go-karting

6655
04:31:39,810 --> 04:31:42,180
and just being at the go-kart track,

6656
04:31:42,180 --> 04:31:43,290
seeing them go around,

6657
04:31:43,290 --> 04:31:46,796
seeing them get faster, seeing them learn that skill,

6658
04:31:46,796 --> 04:31:48,536
you just go look at like,

6659
04:31:48,536 --> 04:31:51,780
what else would I be doing with my life?

6660
04:31:51,780 --> 04:31:56,780
At my age, 45, I'm standing here truly enjoying life.

6661
04:31:57,720 --> 04:31:58,650
I brought into this world.

6662
04:31:58,650 --> 04:32:01,500
What else was so important at this stage

6663
04:32:01,500 --> 04:32:03,964
that I would otherwise be spending my time on?

6664
04:32:03,964 --> 04:32:07,282
- All right, like you mentioned, you like to race cars

6665
04:32:07,282 --> 04:32:10,290
and you do it at a world class competitive level,

6666
04:32:10,290 --> 04:32:11,850
which is incredible.

6667
04:32:11,850 --> 04:32:13,560
So how'd you get into it?

6668
04:32:13,560 --> 04:32:15,450
What attracts you to racing?

6669
04:32:15,450 --> 04:32:17,209
What do you love about it?

6670
04:32:17,209 --> 04:32:19,319
- The funny thing about getting into racing

6671
04:32:19,319 --> 04:32:22,860
is I did not get my driver's license until I was 25.

6672
04:32:22,860 --> 04:32:25,509
I grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark,

6673
04:32:25,509 --> 04:32:30,509
where the tax on cars is basically over 200%.

6674
04:32:32,700 --> 04:32:35,986
So you pay for three cars and you get one.

6675
04:32:35,986 --> 04:32:38,310
And I didn't even have the money for one car,

6676
04:32:38,310 --> 04:32:39,690
let alone three.

6677
04:32:39,690 --> 04:32:41,430
So I could not afford a car growing up.

6678
04:32:41,430 --> 04:32:43,530
We did not have a car growing up,

6679
04:32:43,530 --> 04:32:45,840
but Copenhagen is a nice city

6680
04:32:45,840 --> 04:32:48,720
to be able to get around on a bike or with a bus,

6681
04:32:48,720 --> 04:32:51,603
or as I did for a long period of time, on roller blades.

6682
04:32:53,220 --> 04:32:57,030
But when I was 25,

6683
04:32:57,030 --> 04:32:59,400
I realized I wanted to spend more time in the US.

6684
04:32:59,400 --> 04:33:01,230
I wasn't sure yet that I was gonna move there.

6685
04:33:01,230 --> 04:33:02,850
That turned out later to be true.

6686
04:33:02,850 --> 04:33:05,070
But I knew that if I wanted to spend time in the US,

6687
04:33:05,070 --> 04:33:06,509
I needed to have a driver's license.

6688
04:33:06,509 --> 04:33:08,700
I was not gonna get around very

6689
04:33:08,700 --> 04:33:10,740
well if I didn't know how to drive a car.

6690
04:33:10,740 --> 04:33:12,628
So I got a driver's license at 25.

6691
04:33:12,628 --> 04:33:15,560
Then ended up moving to the US later that year

6692
04:33:15,560 --> 04:33:20,560
and I'd always been into video games, racing video games,

6693
04:33:21,546 --> 04:33:24,711
"Metropolitan Street Racer" on the Dreamcast

6694
04:33:24,711 --> 04:33:28,026
was one of those games that really sucked me into.

6695
04:33:28,026 --> 04:33:32,009
It was the precursor to Project Gotham,

6696
04:33:32,009 --> 04:33:33,630
which was the precursor

6697
04:33:33,630 --> 04:33:36,419
to essentially, Forza Horizon, I think.

6698
04:33:36,419 --> 04:33:37,529
- Oh, okay, interesting.

6699
04:33:37,529 --> 04:33:39,360
- I think that's how the lineage goes.

6700
04:33:39,360 --> 04:33:40,860
Just a great game.

6701
04:33:40,860 --> 04:33:43,257
I actually just fired it up on an emulator

6702
04:33:43,257 --> 04:33:44,340
a few weeks ago.

6703
04:33:44,340 --> 04:33:45,930
And it still sort of kind of holds up

6704
04:33:45,930 --> 04:33:49,169
because it has enough real car dynamics

6705
04:33:49,169 --> 04:33:50,793
that it smells a little bit like driving a real car.

6706
04:33:50,793 --> 04:33:53,250
It's not just like an arcade racer

6707
04:33:53,250 --> 04:33:55,080
like Sega Rally or something like that.

6708
04:33:55,080 --> 04:33:57,029
But I'd always been into that.

6709
04:33:57,029 --> 04:34:00,960
Then I got my driver's license at 25 and moved to the US,

6710
04:34:00,960 --> 04:34:02,610
and then two years later,

6711
04:34:02,610 --> 04:34:04,380
a friend that I'd met in Chicago

6712
04:34:04,380 --> 04:34:07,650
took me to the Chicago Autobahn Country Club,

6713
04:34:07,650 --> 04:34:09,300
which is this great track,

6714
04:34:09,300 --> 04:34:11,520
about 45 minutes from Chicago.

6715
04:34:11,520 --> 04:34:12,837
And I sat in a race car

6716
04:34:12,837 --> 04:34:15,207
and I drove a race car for the first time.

6717
04:34:15,207 --> 04:34:20,207
And I had the same kind of pseudo religious experience

6718
04:34:20,855 --> 04:34:24,509
I did as when I started working on Ruby,

6719
04:34:24,509 --> 04:34:28,860
where I did maybe 20 laps

6720
04:34:28,860 --> 04:34:31,200
in this basically a Mazda race car

6721
04:34:31,200 --> 04:34:33,017
from, I think, it was like the '90s or something,

6722
04:34:33,017 --> 04:34:36,060
like a pretty cheap race car, but a real race car.

6723
04:34:36,060 --> 04:34:39,150
Single seat, manual gearbox,

6724
04:34:39,150 --> 04:34:42,150
but exposed slick wheels, all the stuff.

6725
04:34:42,150 --> 04:34:44,504
And after having had that experience,

6726
04:34:44,504 --> 04:34:47,520
first of all it was just the most amazing thing ever.

6727
04:34:47,520 --> 04:34:51,000
Like the physical sensation of driving a race car

6728
04:34:51,000 --> 04:34:52,680
is really unique.

6729
04:34:52,680 --> 04:34:55,680
And I think if you've driven a car fast,

6730
04:34:55,680 --> 04:34:59,351
you have a maybe a 2% taste of it.

6731
04:34:59,351 --> 04:35:01,410
The exposure to the elements

6732
04:35:01,410 --> 04:35:02,820
that you get in a single seat race car,

6733
04:35:02,820 --> 04:35:04,349
especially one like that where your head

6734
04:35:04,349 --> 04:35:06,000
is actually out in the elements,

6735
04:35:06,000 --> 04:35:08,460
you can see the individual wheels

6736
04:35:08,460 --> 04:35:10,500
and you sensation of speed

6737
04:35:10,500 --> 04:35:13,276
is just so much higher is at a completely different level.

6738
04:35:13,276 --> 04:35:14,700
- So can you actually speak to that?

6739
04:35:14,700 --> 04:35:19,650
So even at that Mazda, so you can feel,

6740
04:35:19,650 --> 04:35:21,630
what can you feel like the track

6741
04:35:21,630 --> 04:35:23,340
reverberating you see? You feel the grip?

6742
04:35:23,340 --> 04:35:26,040
- Oh yeah, not only can you see the bumps

6743
04:35:26,040 --> 04:35:28,140
because you're literally looking straight at the wheel,

6744
04:35:28,140 --> 04:35:29,910
you can feel all the bumps

6745
04:35:29,910 --> 04:35:31,800
because you're running a slick tire.

6746
04:35:31,800 --> 04:35:33,270
It's a really stiff setup.

6747
04:35:33,270 --> 04:35:35,326
It's nothing like taking a fast street car

6748
04:35:35,326 --> 04:35:37,800
out on a racetrack and try to driving a little bit around.

6749
04:35:37,800 --> 04:35:39,749
- So can you feel like the slipping,

6750
04:35:39,749 --> 04:35:41,282
the traction? - Yeah, you feel the slipping.

6751
04:35:41,282 --> 04:35:43,563
hat's a huge part of the satisfaction

6752
04:35:43,563 --> 04:35:44,970
of driving a race car

6753
04:35:44,970 --> 04:35:48,150
is driving in at the edge of adhesion as we call it.

6754
04:35:48,150 --> 04:35:51,270
Where the car's actually sliding a little bit.

6755
04:35:51,270 --> 04:35:52,980
A couple of percent of slip angle

6756
04:35:52,980 --> 04:35:54,630
is the fastest way to drive a race car.

6757
04:35:54,630 --> 04:35:56,460
You don't wanna slide too much that looks great,

6758
04:35:56,460 --> 04:35:58,740
lots of smoke, but it's not fast.

6759
04:35:58,740 --> 04:36:02,700
How you want to drive it is just at the limit of adhesion

6760
04:36:02,700 --> 04:36:04,290
where you're rotating the car

6761
04:36:04,290 --> 04:36:06,930
as much as your tires can manage.

6762
04:36:06,930 --> 04:36:09,208
And then slightly more than that and playing at it,

6763
04:36:09,208 --> 04:36:13,020
keeping it just at that level.

6764
04:36:13,020 --> 04:36:15,090
Because when you're at the level

6765
04:36:15,090 --> 04:36:16,830
or at the limit of adhesion,

6766
04:36:16,830 --> 04:36:18,840
you're essentially just a tiny movement away

6767
04:36:18,840 --> 04:36:20,580
from spinning out.

6768
04:36:20,580 --> 04:36:22,020
I mean, it doesn't take much.

6769
04:36:22,020 --> 04:36:23,340
Then the car starts rotating.

6770
04:36:23,340 --> 04:36:24,840
Once it starts rotating,

6771
04:36:24,840 --> 04:36:27,524
you lose grip and you're going for the wall.

6772
04:36:27,524 --> 04:36:32,340
That balance of danger and skill

6773
04:36:32,340 --> 04:36:34,230
is what's so intoxicating.

6774
04:36:34,230 --> 04:36:37,410
And it's so much better than racing video games too,

6775
04:36:37,410 --> 04:36:40,785
because the criticality is taking up two notches.

6776
04:36:40,785 --> 04:36:43,650
I often think about people who really like gambling,

6777
04:36:43,650 --> 04:36:45,848
where I think like, aren't you just playing poker?

6778
04:36:45,848 --> 04:36:48,426
Like no, the point is not poker.

6779
04:36:48,426 --> 04:36:49,919
Pokers may be part of it,

6780
04:36:49,919 --> 04:36:52,259
but the point is that I could lose my house, right?

6781
04:36:52,259 --> 04:36:56,130
Like that's the addiction that some people get to gambling,

6782
04:36:56,130 --> 04:36:58,415
that there's something real on the line.

6783
04:36:58,415 --> 04:36:59,700
When you're in a race car,

6784
04:36:59,700 --> 04:37:01,619
there's something very real on the line.

6785
04:37:01,619 --> 04:37:03,482
If you get it wrong,

6786
04:37:03,482 --> 04:37:05,355
at the very least,

6787
04:37:05,355 --> 04:37:07,980
you're gonna spin out and properly hit a wall

6788
04:37:07,980 --> 04:37:09,300
and it's gonna be expensive.

6789
04:37:09,300 --> 04:37:12,332
At the very worst, you're not getting out alive.

6790
04:37:12,332 --> 04:37:15,264
And even if modern race cars have gotten way safer

6791
04:37:15,264 --> 04:37:17,145
than they used to be.

6792
04:37:17,145 --> 04:37:20,160
There is that element of danger that's real.

6793
04:37:20,160 --> 04:37:22,919
That there are people who still get seriously hurt

6794
04:37:22,919 --> 04:37:25,050
or even killed in a race car.

6795
04:37:25,050 --> 04:37:28,590
It's mercifully rare compared to what it used to be

6796
04:37:28,590 --> 04:37:31,380
when those maniacs in the '60s

6797
04:37:31,380 --> 04:37:33,450
would do Formula 1 and whatever,

6798
04:37:33,450 --> 04:37:36,240
13% of the grid wouldn't make it to the end of the year

6799
04:37:36,240 --> 04:37:40,890
because they'd just die in a fiery flaming fireball.

6800
04:37:40,890 --> 04:37:42,689
But there's still some of it there.

6801
04:37:42,689 --> 04:37:47,400
And I think that since that there's something on the line

6802
04:37:47,400 --> 04:37:48,480
really contributes to it.

6803
04:37:48,480 --> 04:37:49,312
But it's more than that.

6804
04:37:49,312 --> 04:37:50,849
There's just a physical sensation.

6805
04:37:50,849 --> 04:37:52,619
There's activation of all your forces.

6806
04:37:52,619 --> 04:37:53,856
There's the flow.

6807
04:37:53,856 --> 04:37:58,856
And I think that really cements like why I got addicted,

6808
04:37:59,189 --> 04:38:01,590
'cause I always, I love that flow

6809
04:38:01,590 --> 04:38:02,880
I got out of programming,

6810
04:38:02,880 --> 04:38:04,380
but getting flow out of programming

6811
04:38:04,380 --> 04:38:06,240
is a very inconsistent process.

6812
04:38:06,240 --> 04:38:08,460
I can't just sit down in front of a keyboard

6813
04:38:08,460 --> 04:38:10,439
and go like, all right,

6814
04:38:10,439 --> 04:38:12,000
let's get the flow going.

6815
04:38:12,000 --> 04:38:13,470
It doesn't happen like that.

6816
04:38:13,470 --> 04:38:14,720
The problem has to be just right.

6817
04:38:14,720 --> 04:38:17,189
It has to meet my skills in just a right moment.

6818
04:38:17,189 --> 04:38:18,773
It's a bit of a lottery.

6819
04:38:18,773 --> 04:38:21,029
In a race car is not a lottery at all.

6820
04:38:21,029 --> 04:38:23,369
You sit down in that car, you turn the ignition,

6821
04:38:23,369 --> 04:38:25,380
you go out on track,

6822
04:38:25,380 --> 04:38:27,783
and I get flow virtually guaranteed.

6823
04:38:28,950 --> 04:38:31,259
Because you need, or I need at least

6824
04:38:31,259 --> 04:38:33,450
100% of my brain processing power

6825
04:38:33,450 --> 04:38:36,539
to be able to go at the speed I go without crashing.

6826
04:38:36,539 --> 04:38:40,952
So there's no time to think about the other night

6827
04:38:40,952 --> 04:38:43,928
or the meeting next week or product launch.

6828
04:38:43,928 --> 04:38:46,590
It's completely zen

6829
04:38:46,590 --> 04:38:49,110
in actually the literal sense of the word.

6830
04:38:49,110 --> 04:38:51,450
I think of someone who's really good at meditation,

6831
04:38:51,450 --> 04:38:53,310
that's probably kind of state they get

6832
04:38:53,310 --> 04:38:56,009
into where it's just clear you're in the now,

6833
04:38:56,009 --> 04:38:59,070
there's nothing but you and the next corner.

6834
04:38:59,070 --> 04:39:02,189
That's a really addictive experience.

6835
04:39:02,189 --> 04:39:04,378
So after I've had that, I couldn't get enough.

6836
04:39:04,378 --> 04:39:06,960
I kept going to the track every opportunity I got.

6837
04:39:06,960 --> 04:39:09,150
Every single weekend for about four years,

6838
04:39:09,150 --> 04:39:10,396
I would go to the track.

6839
04:39:10,396 --> 04:39:11,517
And by the end of that time,

6840
04:39:11,517 --> 04:39:14,520
I'd finally worked up enough skill

6841
04:39:14,520 --> 04:39:16,680
and enough success with the company

6842
04:39:16,680 --> 04:39:20,250
that I could afford to go, quote, unquote, "real racing."

6843
04:39:20,250 --> 04:39:21,119
So I started doing that.

6844
04:39:21,119 --> 04:39:22,439
I started driving these Porsches,

6845
04:39:22,439 --> 04:39:23,790
and then as soon as I got into that,

6846
04:39:23,790 --> 04:39:25,700
as soon as I got into, quote, unquote, "real competition,"

6847
04:39:25,700 --> 04:39:28,594
I was like, I wonder how far you can take this.

6848
04:39:28,594 --> 04:39:31,380
And it didn't take that long

6849
04:39:31,380 --> 04:39:33,300
before I decided, you know what?

6850
04:39:33,300 --> 04:39:34,560
I can take this all the way.

6851
04:39:34,560 --> 04:39:39,300
My great hero in racing is Tom Kristensen, fellow Dane.

6852
04:39:39,300 --> 04:39:41,970
The Mr. Le Mans, as they call him.

6853
04:39:41,970 --> 04:39:43,627
The greatest endurance race in the world.

6854
04:39:43,627 --> 04:39:46,590
The 24 hours of Le Mans has been won more times

6855
04:39:46,590 --> 04:39:48,780
than any other by Tom Kristensen.

6856
04:39:48,780 --> 04:39:51,384
He won the race nine times.

6857
04:39:51,384 --> 04:39:56,384
So Tom just really turned me onto Le Mans.

6858
04:39:56,430 --> 04:39:59,460
I've been watching Le Mans since I think the '80s.

6859
04:39:59,460 --> 04:40:01,890
I have my earliest memories of watching that on TV.

6860
04:40:01,890 --> 04:40:05,370
The race has been going since I think 20s.

6861
04:40:05,370 --> 04:40:07,020
But in the '80s I got kind of into it.

6862
04:40:07,020 --> 04:40:09,360
And then in the late '90s,

6863
04:40:09,360 --> 04:40:11,520
early 2000s when Tom started winning,

6864
04:40:11,520 --> 04:40:13,890
I like pretty much every other Dane

6865
04:40:13,890 --> 04:40:16,440
started watching the race almost religiously.

6866
04:40:16,440 --> 04:40:17,310
So I thought, you know what?

6867
04:40:17,310 --> 04:40:18,147
I wanna get to Le Mans.

6868
04:40:18,147 --> 04:40:20,370
And this is the magic thing about racing,

6869
04:40:20,370 --> 04:40:23,010
that if I get into basketball,

6870
04:40:23,010 --> 04:40:25,200
like I can't set a realistic expectation

6871
04:40:25,200 --> 04:40:26,872
that I'm gonna play in the NBA,

6872
04:40:26,872 --> 04:40:28,320
then I'm gonna go to the finals.

6873
04:40:28,320 --> 04:40:30,930
Or I get into tennis and I'm gonna play at Wimbledon,

6874
04:40:30,930 --> 04:40:32,250
that just doesn't happen.

6875
04:40:32,250 --> 04:40:33,450
But racing thing is special in this way

6876
04:40:33,450 --> 04:40:35,760
because it requires a fair amount of money

6877
04:40:35,760 --> 04:40:36,780
to keep these cars running.

6878
04:40:36,780 --> 04:40:37,880
It's really expensive.

6879
04:40:38,839 --> 04:40:39,672
It's like having a small startup.

6880
04:40:39,672 --> 04:40:41,610
You need to fly a bunch of people around the world

6881
04:40:41,610 --> 04:40:43,440
and buy expensive equipment and so forth.

6882
04:40:43,440 --> 04:40:44,790
So you need a bunch of capital.

6883
04:40:44,790 --> 04:40:47,160
And I had some through the success of the company.

6884
04:40:47,160 --> 04:40:50,790
So I could do it, which meant that I could get to Le Mans.

6885
04:40:50,790 --> 04:40:52,200
So I set that as my goal.

6886
04:40:52,200 --> 04:40:54,030
I wanna get to Le Mans.

6887
04:40:54,030 --> 04:40:58,119
And I started racing in real competition 2009.

6888
04:40:58,119 --> 04:41:00,720
And three years later in 2012,

6889
04:41:00,720 --> 04:41:02,820
I was at the grid of Le Mans for the first time.

6890
04:41:02,820 --> 04:41:07,203
- We should say, so Le Mans, 24-hour race endurance.

6891
04:41:08,160 --> 04:41:10,080
I mean, this is insane.

6892
04:41:10,080 --> 04:41:11,430
- There are three drivers, mind you.

6893
04:41:11,430 --> 04:41:14,580
So it's not like one guy just drive for 20 hours,

6894
04:41:14,580 --> 04:41:15,413
24 hours straight.

6895
04:41:15,413 --> 04:41:17,790
But still, it's a pretty tough race

6896
04:41:17,790 --> 04:41:20,490
both physically and mentally, especially mentally.

6897
04:41:20,490 --> 04:41:24,840
When you've been up for 24 plus hours,

6898
04:41:24,840 --> 04:41:28,260
you're not quite as sharp as when you first wake up.

6899
04:41:28,260 --> 04:41:29,640
And this is funny about Le Mans too.

6900
04:41:29,640 --> 04:41:31,710
It starts at around four o'clock in the afternoon.

6901
04:41:31,710 --> 04:41:33,420
So you've already been up for half a day

6902
04:41:33,420 --> 04:41:34,530
by the time the race starts.

6903
04:41:34,530 --> 04:41:37,013
And then there's 24 hours to go before you're done.

6904
04:41:37,013 --> 04:41:38,711
And you'll be in the car for anywhere

6905
04:41:38,711 --> 04:41:41,850
from usually an hour and a half

6906
04:41:41,850 --> 04:41:43,509
to a maximum of four hours.

6907
04:41:43,509 --> 04:41:46,890
The regulations say four out of six is the max you can do.

6908
04:41:46,890 --> 04:41:48,780
I've spent perhaps two and a half hours

6909
04:41:48,780 --> 04:41:50,790
in a single stint at Le Mans.

6910
04:41:50,790 --> 04:41:51,900
It's pretty taxing.

6911
04:41:51,900 --> 04:41:55,140
You're going 200 miles an hour

6912
04:41:55,140 --> 04:41:56,850
into some of these turns,

6913
04:41:56,850 --> 04:42:00,450
and there's another 60 cars on track.

6914
04:42:00,450 --> 04:42:03,210
Whenever I'm in my normal category,

6915
04:42:03,210 --> 04:42:05,100
which is the LMP2 category,

6916
04:42:05,100 --> 04:42:08,693
I have GT cars, which are more like a Ferrari and a Porsche

6917
04:42:08,693 --> 04:42:10,110
that I have to overtake.

6918
04:42:10,110 --> 04:42:11,460
And then I have these hypercar,

6919
04:42:11,460 --> 04:42:13,950
which is the top class that are overtaking me.

6920
04:42:13,950 --> 04:42:17,190
So you got a lot going on and you gotta stay sharp

6921
04:42:17,190 --> 04:42:19,020
for two and a half hours straight to do that.

6922
04:42:19,020 --> 04:42:22,830
That is just a guaranteed way to get incredible flow

6923
04:42:22,830 --> 04:42:24,570
for long, long stretches of time.

6924
04:42:24,570 --> 04:42:26,378
That's why you get addicted to it.

6925
04:42:26,378 --> 04:42:27,750
That was why I got addicted.

6926
04:42:27,750 --> 04:42:29,100
- You gotta talk me through this video.

6927
04:42:29,100 --> 04:42:31,007
This video of you in these LMP2s.

6928
04:42:31,007 --> 04:42:33,180
- Oh, yes. - This is such a cool.

6929
04:42:33,180 --> 04:42:34,350
This is so cool.

6930
04:42:34,350 --> 04:42:37,475
- And this was probably my favorite battle of my career.

6931
04:42:37,475 --> 04:42:39,425
- [Commentator] And Heinemeier Hansson

6932
04:42:39,425 --> 04:42:41,670
has beat past to add five...

6933
04:42:41,670 --> 04:42:45,300
- Yeah, so this is me driving against Nico Muller

6934
04:42:45,300 --> 04:42:47,490
at the Shanghai International Circuit.

6935
04:42:47,490 --> 04:42:49,937
- You're on the outside here? - I'm on the outside in the...

6936
04:42:49,937 --> 04:42:51,720
- How cool is it? - Blue and white.

6937
04:42:51,720 --> 04:42:53,730
And we go a whole track around

6938
04:42:53,730 --> 04:42:54,810
with basically a piece of paper

6939
04:42:54,810 --> 04:42:56,250
between a seat down this back straight.

6940
04:42:56,250 --> 04:42:58,410
I get so close to him because I wanna force him over

6941
04:42:58,410 --> 04:43:00,090
on the other side of the track,

6942
04:43:00,090 --> 04:43:02,372
such that he can't just box me in.

6943
04:43:02,372 --> 04:43:03,960
And we've been fighting already

6944
04:43:03,960 --> 04:43:06,270
at this point for basically 40 minutes straight.

6945
04:43:06,270 --> 04:43:08,970
I've been managing to keep this professional driver

6946
04:43:08,970 --> 04:43:09,990
behind me for 40 minutes.

6947
04:43:09,990 --> 04:43:11,817
And he finally passes me,

6948
04:43:11,817 --> 04:43:14,160
but we just keep the battle on for the whole time.

6949
04:43:14,160 --> 04:43:16,860
And it really just shows both these kinds of cars.

6950
04:43:16,860 --> 04:43:18,570
The Le Mans prototypes.

6951
04:43:18,570 --> 04:43:20,280
We don't actually ever touch.

6952
04:43:20,280 --> 04:43:21,680
We get within about an inch.

6953
04:43:23,580 --> 04:43:24,930
And keep going around

6954
04:43:24,930 --> 04:43:26,370
Shanghai circuit too. - What a cool.

6955
04:43:26,370 --> 04:43:29,627
How did you get so good? Like what?

6956
04:43:29,627 --> 04:43:31,743
I mean that's a fascinating story, right?

6957
04:43:31,743 --> 04:43:34,049
That you are able to get so good.

6958
04:43:34,049 --> 04:43:36,262
- I'm pretty good for the kind of driver I am,

6959
04:43:36,262 --> 04:43:38,190
which is called the gentleman driver,

6960
04:43:38,190 --> 04:43:39,990
which means I'm not a professional driver.

6961
04:43:39,990 --> 04:43:43,039
And like many good gentlemen drivers,

6962
04:43:43,039 --> 04:43:45,750
when we're at our really best,

6963
04:43:45,750 --> 04:43:48,180
we can be quite competitive with even professional drivers

6964
04:43:48,180 --> 04:43:50,250
who have been doing this their whole life.

6965
04:43:50,250 --> 04:43:52,080
The difference between us and the professionals

6966
04:43:52,080 --> 04:43:53,760
is the professionals could do it every time

6967
04:43:53,760 --> 04:43:55,020
or more or less every time.

6968
04:43:55,020 --> 04:43:56,910
So I can't be this good all the time.

6969
04:43:56,910 --> 04:43:58,230
When everything is just right,

6970
04:43:58,230 --> 04:44:01,950
I can be competitive with professional drivers,

6971
04:44:01,950 --> 04:44:03,900
but that's not how you win championships.

6972
04:44:03,900 --> 04:44:05,940
That's not how you get paid by factories to drive.

6973
04:44:05,940 --> 04:44:07,890
You gotta be good every time you go out.

6974
04:44:07,890 --> 04:44:09,510
So that's a huge difference.

6975
04:44:09,510 --> 04:44:12,335
But some of it was also just, I really put my mind to it

6976
04:44:12,335 --> 04:44:14,507
by the time I realized race cars

6977
04:44:14,507 --> 04:44:17,446
is what I want to do as my serious hobby.

6978
04:44:17,446 --> 04:44:20,310
I put in thousands of hours.

6979
04:44:20,310 --> 04:44:22,200
- Have you crashed?

6980
04:44:22,200 --> 04:44:23,490
What's the worst crash?

6981
04:44:23,490 --> 04:44:24,630
- I've had a lot of crashes,

6982
04:44:24,630 --> 04:44:26,670
but thankfully, knock on wood,

6983
04:44:26,670 --> 04:44:28,350
I haven't had any crashes

6984
04:44:28,350 --> 04:44:30,210
where I've gotten really seriously hurt.

6985
04:44:30,210 --> 04:44:31,830
- Have you like wrecked the car?

6986
04:44:31,830 --> 04:44:33,120
- Oh yes, oh yes.

6987
04:44:33,120 --> 04:44:34,440
I've wrecked many car.

6988
04:44:34,440 --> 04:44:35,523
- So what's that feel like?

6989
04:44:35,523 --> 04:44:36,870
Just you wreck a car.

6990
04:44:36,870 --> 04:44:37,770
Like how do you get...

6991
04:44:37,770 --> 04:44:39,570
- It feels like total shit

6992
04:44:39,570 --> 04:44:42,330
if you're in a real race and other people depend on you.

6993
04:44:42,330 --> 04:44:43,937
It's not even so much to car,

6994
04:44:43,937 --> 04:44:45,960
although it's also sometimes that these cars

6995
04:44:45,960 --> 04:44:47,640
are expensive to repair and that sucks

6996
04:44:47,640 --> 04:44:49,470
and it feels so wasteful

6997
04:44:49,470 --> 04:44:51,964
in a way when you crash some of these cars.

6998
04:44:51,964 --> 04:44:55,380
But the sense that you're letting a team down.

6999
04:44:55,380 --> 04:44:57,930
Endurance racing is a team sport.

7000
04:44:57,930 --> 04:44:59,370
Not only do you have your mechanics,

7001
04:44:59,370 --> 04:45:00,720
do you usually have co-drivers.

7002
04:45:00,720 --> 04:45:02,760
So when I crash I just feel like,

7003
04:45:02,760 --> 04:45:05,021
damn it, I could have avoided this.

7004
04:45:05,021 --> 04:45:07,843
- Yeah, but also you could have died.

7005
04:45:07,843 --> 04:45:09,870
- Do you know what's funny?

7006
04:45:09,870 --> 04:45:11,130
I never think about that.

7007
04:45:11,130 --> 04:45:12,540
I don't think you can.

7008
04:45:12,540 --> 04:45:14,611
Because I think the moment you start thinking about

7009
04:45:14,611 --> 04:45:17,275
being able to die, you can't do it.

7010
04:45:17,275 --> 04:45:18,540
You can't go fast.

7011
04:45:18,540 --> 04:45:23,540
- Well, I'm sure not to go all Carl Jung and Freud here,

7012
04:45:25,260 --> 04:45:27,900
but I'm sure that's always present

7013
04:45:27,900 --> 04:45:29,520
in the back of your mind somewhere.

7014
04:45:29,520 --> 04:45:31,560
You're not just bringing it to the surface.

7015
04:45:31,560 --> 04:45:34,644
- It is in the sense that it's part of the appeal,

7016
04:45:34,644 --> 04:45:37,950
it's part of the sense that there's something on the line

7017
04:45:37,950 --> 04:45:39,450
that this isn't just virtual.

7018
04:45:39,450 --> 04:45:42,272
I can't just hit reset, restart, reboot.

7019
04:45:42,272 --> 04:45:44,478
If I crash this car,

7020
04:45:44,478 --> 04:45:47,378
we're gonna be out or we're gonna be disadvantaged

7021
04:45:47,378 --> 04:45:49,920
or it's gonna get destroyed or I might get hurt.

7022
04:45:49,920 --> 04:45:53,610
I've gotten lightly hurt a few times.

7023
04:45:53,610 --> 04:45:56,130
I actually had the year we won

7024
04:45:56,130 --> 04:45:57,968
24 hours of Le Mans in our class,

7025
04:45:57,968 --> 04:46:02,968
I've been training in this formula 3.5 car.

7026
04:46:03,720 --> 04:46:05,040
It's a really fast car.

7027
04:46:05,040 --> 04:46:07,350
It's a really nice exercise to do,

7028
04:46:07,350 --> 04:46:10,050
but it's also, it doesn't have power steering.

7029
04:46:10,050 --> 04:46:11,970
So some of these race cars, especially the open-seaters,

7030
04:46:11,970 --> 04:46:13,080
they don't have power steering.

7031
04:46:13,080 --> 04:46:15,120
Which means that the steering wheel

7032
04:46:15,120 --> 04:46:18,719
is basically directly connected to the front wheels.

7033
04:46:18,719 --> 04:46:21,210
So if you crash one of those cars

7034
04:46:21,210 --> 04:46:23,325
and the front wheel suddenly turn,

7035
04:46:23,325 --> 04:46:24,870
you're really gonna hurt your hands

7036
04:46:24,870 --> 04:46:26,550
if you don't get your hands off the wheel.

7037
04:46:26,550 --> 04:46:28,170
I hadn't raced enough of those cars

7038
04:46:28,170 --> 04:46:30,300
to know that I had to get, or to have the instinct,

7039
04:46:30,300 --> 04:46:31,650
to have developed the instinct

7040
04:46:31,650 --> 04:46:33,240
that I had to get my hands off the wheel.

7041
04:46:33,240 --> 04:46:35,730
So I didn't, and I really hurt my hand

7042
04:46:35,730 --> 04:46:39,510
and this was just I think a month before the 24 of Le Mans.

7043
04:46:39,510 --> 04:46:41,670
So I thought, ah man, I'm gonna have to miss it this year.

7044
04:46:41,670 --> 04:46:44,760
I had like a, not a cast, it was just seriously sprained.

7045
04:46:44,760 --> 04:46:47,070
And then somehow miraculously

7046
04:46:47,070 --> 04:46:48,990
like a week before the event,

7047
04:46:48,990 --> 04:46:50,610
I was like, yeah, actually it's okay now.

7048
04:46:50,610 --> 04:46:51,807
So got to do it.

7049
04:46:51,807 --> 04:46:54,150
And that would've been grave regret

7050
04:46:54,150 --> 04:46:57,630
if I would've seen my team go on to win the race

7051
04:46:57,630 --> 04:46:59,520
and I would have to sit on the sidelines.

7052
04:46:59,520 --> 04:47:01,410
But I really have been quite fortunate

7053
04:47:01,410 --> 04:47:03,540
in the sense that most of my crashes

7054
04:47:03,540 --> 04:47:08,040
have just been expensive or sporting inconvenient.

7055
04:47:08,040 --> 04:47:10,825
They've never been something where I got seriously hurt.

7056
04:47:10,825 --> 04:47:12,570
But I've seen plenty of people

7057
04:47:12,570 --> 04:47:15,360
who have in fact, my co-driver this year

7058
04:47:15,360 --> 04:47:18,630
and for several years, Pietro Fittipaldi

7059
04:47:18,630 --> 04:47:21,540
drove a race car at Spa.

7060
04:47:21,540 --> 04:47:24,780
Spa is one of the great race tracks of all time.

7061
04:47:24,780 --> 04:47:27,810
And it has this iconic corner called Eau Rouge,

7062
04:47:27,810 --> 04:47:29,090
which is probably the most famous corner

7063
04:47:29,090 --> 04:47:30,180
in all of motorsports.

7064
04:47:30,180 --> 04:47:34,140
It has a great compression before you climb uphill.

7065
04:47:34,140 --> 04:47:37,500
It's extremely fast, very difficult corner.

7066
04:47:37,500 --> 04:47:39,472
And just as he does the compression,

7067
04:47:39,472 --> 04:47:41,157
his car basically sets out

7068
04:47:41,157 --> 04:47:42,780
and he loses his power steering

7069
04:47:42,780 --> 04:47:44,280
and he drives straight into the wall

7070
04:47:44,280 --> 04:47:45,660
and breaks both his legs

7071
04:47:45,660 --> 04:47:48,120
and basically faced the prospect

7072
04:47:48,120 --> 04:47:49,740
that maybe his career was over.

7073
04:47:49,740 --> 04:47:52,110
I've had other teammates

7074
04:47:52,110 --> 04:47:54,300
and people I know have serious injuries

7075
04:47:54,300 --> 04:47:56,621
that's really hurt them.

7076
04:47:56,621 --> 04:47:58,813
And yet what's funny, as you say,

7077
04:47:58,813 --> 04:48:00,813
you'd think that would sink in.

7078
04:48:01,680 --> 04:48:06,680
The year before we won in 2014,

7079
04:48:07,200 --> 04:48:10,800
that same car had a Danish driver in it at Le Mans

7080
04:48:10,800 --> 04:48:13,650
at the race I was driving who died.

7081
04:48:13,650 --> 04:48:16,890
He lost control of the car

7082
04:48:16,890 --> 04:48:20,040
when there was a bit of rain on the track

7083
04:48:20,040 --> 04:48:22,230
and the track went unfortunately designed

7084
04:48:22,230 --> 04:48:25,230
in such a poor way that there was a very big tree

7085
04:48:25,230 --> 04:48:27,001
right behind the railing.

7086
04:48:27,001 --> 04:48:32,001
And he hit that tree at full speed, pulled 90 Gs

7087
04:48:34,020 --> 04:48:36,240
and was dead on the spot,

7088
04:48:36,240 --> 04:48:39,120
which was just such an extremely

7089
04:48:39,120 --> 04:48:41,699
awful experience to go through.

7090
04:48:41,699 --> 04:48:43,860
I finished second that year,

7091
04:48:43,860 --> 04:48:46,721
which should have been caused for a bunch of celebration.

7092
04:48:46,721 --> 04:48:49,540
But it was just tainted by the fact that

7093
04:48:50,850 --> 04:48:55,350
not only did a driver die, a fellow Dane died.

7094
04:48:55,350 --> 04:48:57,303
A guy I knew died.

7095
04:48:59,938 --> 04:49:01,830
That was pretty tough.

7096
04:49:01,830 --> 04:49:06,000
- So that throw that into the pile of the things

7097
04:49:06,000 --> 04:49:07,950
that have to be considered is the weather conditions

7098
04:49:07,950 --> 04:49:09,905
that you mentioned of the track.

7099
04:49:09,905 --> 04:49:12,570
The weather is dry or wet.

7100
04:49:12,570 --> 04:49:14,220
- It's a huge part of it.

7101
04:49:14,220 --> 04:49:15,873
- Even just last year at Le Mans.

7102
04:49:16,920 --> 04:49:18,813
It was raining and I was out,

7103
04:49:19,650 --> 04:49:23,160
and I hadn't made a serious mistake

7104
04:49:23,160 --> 04:49:24,810
at the 24 hours of Le Mans

7105
04:49:24,810 --> 04:49:29,010
since I did the first race in 2012

7106
04:49:29,010 --> 04:49:31,584
where I put it in the sand trap

7107
04:49:31,584 --> 04:49:33,540
with like four hours to go

7108
04:49:33,540 --> 04:49:35,310
and we lost a couple of lap getting pulled out,

7109
04:49:35,310 --> 04:49:38,040
but it didn't actually change anything for our result

7110
04:49:38,040 --> 04:49:41,040
because that was just how the field was spread out.

7111
04:49:41,040 --> 04:49:42,660
I'd made minor mistakes over the years

7112
04:49:42,660 --> 04:49:43,980
but nothing that really set us out.

7113
04:49:43,980 --> 04:49:48,270
And at the race last year when it was raining,

7114
04:49:48,270 --> 04:49:51,450
I first clobbered a Ford Mustang

7115
04:49:51,450 --> 04:49:53,760
when I made an overambitious pass

7116
04:49:53,760 --> 04:49:57,324
on a damp part of the track and couldn't stop in time

7117
04:49:57,324 --> 04:50:00,660
and then felt absolutely awful

7118
04:50:00,660 --> 04:50:03,360
as I sat in the gravel pit for two laps

7119
04:50:03,360 --> 04:50:05,130
and knew that our race was over.

7120
04:50:05,130 --> 04:50:07,410
A race where we were highly competitive.

7121
04:50:07,410 --> 04:50:09,390
You're not blessed with a competitive car,

7122
04:50:09,390 --> 04:50:11,790
a competitive team and competitive setup every year.

7123
04:50:11,790 --> 04:50:13,500
I know how rare that is.

7124
04:50:13,500 --> 04:50:16,320
So to know that we had had a chance that year

7125
04:50:16,320 --> 04:50:19,380
and I sort of squandered it felt really bad,

7126
04:50:19,380 --> 04:50:21,503
but that got compounded.

7127
04:50:21,503 --> 04:50:25,560
I got back on track, barely made it another stint

7128
04:50:25,560 --> 04:50:26,940
and then put it in the gravel trap

7129
04:50:26,940 --> 04:50:29,160
again when it started raining on the entrance into Porsche.

7130
04:50:29,160 --> 04:50:32,790
So this is part of why racing is so addicting too

7131
04:50:32,790 --> 04:50:35,460
because the highs are very, very high.

7132
04:50:35,460 --> 04:50:38,550
When you win a race like the 24 hours of Le Mans.

7133
04:50:38,550 --> 04:50:40,110
It feels just incredible.

7134
04:50:40,110 --> 04:50:41,040
There's so much emotion.

7135
04:50:41,040 --> 04:50:44,790
But if you fuck it up, the lows are very, very low.

7136
04:50:44,790 --> 04:50:46,740
- What are the things you're paying attention to

7137
04:50:46,740 --> 04:50:47,740
when you're driving?

7138
04:50:49,981 --> 04:50:51,120
What are the parameters?

7139
04:50:51,120 --> 04:50:52,710
What are you loading in?

7140
04:50:52,710 --> 04:50:57,058
Are you feeling the grip?

7141
04:50:57,058 --> 04:50:59,310
Are you basically increasing the speed

7142
04:50:59,310 --> 04:51:01,374
and seeing what like a constant feedback system

7143
04:51:01,374 --> 04:51:04,320
effect that has on the grip

7144
04:51:04,320 --> 04:51:06,390
and you're trying to manage that

7145
04:51:06,390 --> 04:51:08,659
and try to find that optimal slip angle?

7146
04:51:08,659 --> 04:51:12,450
Are you looking around using your eyes?

7147
04:51:12,450 --> 04:51:13,800
Are you smelling things?

7148
04:51:13,800 --> 04:51:15,750
Are you listening just feeling the wind

7149
04:51:16,629 --> 04:51:20,310
or are you looking at the field too?

7150
04:51:20,310 --> 04:51:23,040
Like how'd you not hit that guy at all?

7151
04:51:23,040 --> 04:51:24,080
You get close with an inches, right?

7152
04:51:24,080 --> 04:51:26,370
So you have to pay attention to that too.

7153
04:51:26,370 --> 04:51:28,710
It's really interesting about that specific battle

7154
04:51:28,710 --> 04:51:31,847
where we're literally a few inches apart.

7155
04:51:31,847 --> 04:51:33,780
I can't fully explain it,

7156
04:51:33,780 --> 04:51:37,800
but humans can develop an incredible sense of space.

7157
04:51:37,800 --> 04:51:41,310
Where I can't see the edge of the back of my car,

7158
04:51:41,310 --> 04:51:43,170
but I can know exactly where it is.

7159
04:51:43,170 --> 04:51:45,584
I can have a mental model in my head

7160
04:51:45,584 --> 04:51:48,290
that gives me the exact dimensions of this car

7161
04:51:48,290 --> 04:51:51,030
just that I can run within a few inches

7162
04:51:51,030 --> 04:51:52,020
of a competitor car

7163
04:51:52,020 --> 04:51:54,030
or within a few inches of the wall

7164
04:51:54,030 --> 04:51:57,090
and not hit either when things go well.

7165
04:51:57,090 --> 04:51:58,898
The car is about two meters wide

7166
04:51:58,898 --> 04:52:02,220
and it's quite long, five meters.

7167
04:52:02,220 --> 04:52:03,270
And you can't see everything.

7168
04:52:03,270 --> 04:52:04,890
The mirrors are actually kind of shit.

7169
04:52:04,890 --> 04:52:06,750
There's no rear view mirror in these cars.

7170
04:52:06,750 --> 04:52:07,620
You can't see out the back.

7171
04:52:07,620 --> 04:52:10,560
You can only see through your two side mirrors.

7172
04:52:10,560 --> 04:52:13,500
But you formed this intuitive mental model

7173
04:52:13,500 --> 04:52:15,558
when you get good enough at this.

7174
04:52:15,558 --> 04:52:17,820
But what I actually pay attention to most

7175
04:52:17,820 --> 04:52:20,070
is I run a program.

7176
04:52:20,070 --> 04:52:21,930
What I try to do when I go to a racetrack

7177
04:52:21,930 --> 04:52:25,140
is I try to load up the best program I know how

7178
04:52:25,140 --> 04:52:26,970
for every single corner.

7179
04:52:26,970 --> 04:52:28,560
What's my break point?

7180
04:52:28,560 --> 04:52:30,003
What's my acceleration point?

7181
04:52:30,003 --> 04:52:33,960
What's my break trailing curve?

7182
04:52:33,960 --> 04:52:36,180
And I try to pick up that program in part

7183
04:52:36,180 --> 04:52:38,850
just by finding it myself and how fast I can go.

7184
04:52:38,850 --> 04:52:40,290
But even more so than that

7185
04:52:40,290 --> 04:52:42,780
by copying my professional competitors

7186
04:52:42,780 --> 04:52:45,180
or not competitors, co-drivers.

7187
04:52:45,180 --> 04:52:47,850
So I usually always race with a pro.

7188
04:52:47,850 --> 04:52:49,988
And modern race cars produce an absolute

7189
04:52:49,988 --> 04:52:51,900
enormous amount of data,

7190
04:52:51,900 --> 04:52:54,900
and you can analyze all that data after each outing.

7191
04:52:54,900 --> 04:52:57,000
You can see an exact trace

7192
04:52:57,000 --> 04:52:59,340
of how much you pushed the brake pedal,

7193
04:52:59,340 --> 04:53:01,646
how much you did in terms of steering inputs.

7194
04:53:01,646 --> 04:53:03,330
When you got on the gas,

7195
04:53:03,330 --> 04:53:06,960
you can see every millisecond you're losing

7196
04:53:06,960 --> 04:53:08,940
is evident in those charts.

7197
04:53:08,940 --> 04:53:11,370
So what I try to do is I try to look at the chart

7198
04:53:11,370 --> 04:53:13,470
and then I try to load that in

7199
04:53:13,470 --> 04:53:14,910
and like that's what I gotta do.

7200
04:53:14,910 --> 04:53:16,980
Oh, in this corner 17,

7201
04:53:16,980 --> 04:53:21,300
I have to be 10 bar lighter on the brake.

7202
04:53:21,300 --> 04:53:22,590
So I try to load that program in

7203
04:53:22,590 --> 04:53:23,837
and then I try to repeat it now.

7204
04:53:23,837 --> 04:53:25,766
Then there are all the things that changes.

7205
04:53:25,766 --> 04:53:28,620
Your tires change quite a lot.

7206
04:53:28,620 --> 04:53:31,320
These tires are made to only last

7207
04:53:31,320 --> 04:53:32,940
40 minutes in many cases.

7208
04:53:32,940 --> 04:53:35,220
Sometimes at Le Mans we can go longer,

7209
04:53:35,220 --> 04:53:37,710
but at some racetracks they'll last as little as 40 minutes

7210
04:53:37,710 --> 04:53:39,750
before they really fall off.

7211
04:53:39,750 --> 04:53:40,680
So you gotta manage that.

7212
04:53:40,680 --> 04:53:42,780
That the grip is constantly changing.

7213
04:53:42,780 --> 04:53:44,430
So your program have to suddenly fit

7214
04:53:44,430 --> 04:53:45,870
those changing circumstances.

7215
04:53:45,870 --> 04:53:47,430
And then in endurance racing,

7216
04:53:47,430 --> 04:53:49,260
you're constantly interacting with other cars

7217
04:53:49,260 --> 04:53:51,120
because you're passing slower classes

7218
04:53:51,120 --> 04:53:52,530
or you're getting passed by a faster class.

7219
04:53:52,530 --> 04:53:54,582
So that's part of the equation.

7220
04:53:54,582 --> 04:53:57,210
And then you're trying to dance the car

7221
04:53:57,210 --> 04:53:58,904
around the limit of adhesion.

7222
04:53:58,904 --> 04:54:01,380
So you got all those factors playing at the same time.

7223
04:54:01,380 --> 04:54:03,270
But above all else for me

7224
04:54:03,270 --> 04:54:06,268
is to try to become a robot.

7225
04:54:06,268 --> 04:54:09,540
Like how can I repeat this set of steps

7226
04:54:09,540 --> 04:54:13,200
exactly as I'm supposed to

7227
04:54:13,200 --> 04:54:14,250
for two and a half hours straight

7228
04:54:14,250 --> 04:54:17,530
without making 100 milliseconds worth of mistakes?

7229
04:54:17,530 --> 04:54:20,730
- Yeah, low latency algorithm.

7230
04:54:20,730 --> 04:54:22,470
- That's really a huge part of it actually.

7231
04:54:22,470 --> 04:54:26,310
Your latency is enormously important

7232
04:54:26,310 --> 04:54:28,380
in terms of being able to catch

7233
04:54:28,380 --> 04:54:29,940
when the car starts slipping.

7234
04:54:29,940 --> 04:54:32,760
You get this sensation in your body

7235
04:54:32,760 --> 04:54:35,070
that the G-force are a little off,

7236
04:54:35,070 --> 04:54:36,300
the slip angle is a little off,

7237
04:54:36,300 --> 04:54:38,370
and then you have to counter steer.

7238
04:54:38,370 --> 04:54:40,380
And obviously the best race car drivers

7239
04:54:40,380 --> 04:54:41,820
just feel like an intuition.

7240
04:54:41,820 --> 04:54:43,329
I have some intuition.

7241
04:54:43,329 --> 04:54:44,270
I don't have all of it,

7242
04:54:44,270 --> 04:54:47,040
so I do occasionally spin my car.

7243
04:54:47,040 --> 04:54:48,870
But that's the challenge.

7244
04:54:48,870 --> 04:54:51,270
- From everything you've studied and understand,

7245
04:54:51,270 --> 04:54:54,003
what does it take to achieve mastery in racing?

7246
04:54:54,003 --> 04:54:55,080
Like what does it take

7247
04:54:55,080 --> 04:54:58,441
to become the best race car driver in the world?

7248
04:54:58,441 --> 04:55:00,000
- Obsession is part of it.

7249
04:55:00,000 --> 04:55:05,000
When I read and hear about Senna and the other greats,

7250
04:55:05,010 --> 04:55:07,675
they were just singularly focused.

7251
04:55:07,675 --> 04:55:11,460
Max Verstappen is the current champion of the world

7252
04:55:11,460 --> 04:55:13,290
and he is the same kind.

7253
04:55:13,290 --> 04:55:16,350
Max has been fascinating to watch.

7254
04:55:16,350 --> 04:55:18,060
I mean he is a phenomenal race car driver,

7255
04:55:18,060 --> 04:55:20,670
but he also literally does nothing else.

7256
04:55:20,670 --> 04:55:21,990
When he is not at the racetrack,

7257
04:55:21,990 --> 04:55:24,030
he's driving sim racing.

7258
04:55:24,030 --> 04:55:27,600
Like he's literally in video games doing more racing

7259
04:55:27,600 --> 04:55:30,030
when he is not doing all the racing he's already doing.

7260
04:55:30,030 --> 04:55:31,609
- Is there a specific skill

7261
04:55:31,609 --> 04:55:33,870
that have that like stands out to you

7262
04:55:33,870 --> 04:55:36,527
as supernatural through all of that obsession?

7263
04:55:36,527 --> 04:55:39,479
Is it a bunch of factors or are they actually able to,

7264
04:55:39,479 --> 04:55:41,223
like you said, develop a sense?

7265
04:55:41,223 --> 04:55:45,326
Is it they're able to get to the very edge of the slip?

7266
04:55:45,326 --> 04:55:49,350
- They're able to develop very fine tuned sensibilities

7267
04:55:49,350 --> 04:55:50,940
for when the car's sliding.

7268
04:55:50,940 --> 04:55:53,190
They can feel just these tiny moments

7269
04:55:53,190 --> 04:55:55,140
or movements in the chassis

7270
04:55:55,140 --> 04:55:57,720
that transports up usually through their ass.

7271
04:55:57,720 --> 04:56:00,150
That's why you call us like a butt meter

7272
04:56:00,150 --> 04:56:03,930
that goes up and you feel like the car is loose

7273
04:56:03,930 --> 04:56:06,787
or you feel like you're just about to lock up.

7274
04:56:06,787 --> 04:56:10,080
You can really hone that tuning.

7275
04:56:10,080 --> 04:56:10,913
Then the other thing

7276
04:56:10,913 --> 04:56:13,170
is you have to have really good reaction time.

7277
04:56:13,170 --> 04:56:16,470
And when you look at great Formula 1 drivers,

7278
04:56:16,470 --> 04:56:19,041
they can generally have a reaction time

7279
04:56:19,041 --> 04:56:22,439
of just under 200 milliseconds, which is awesome.

7280
04:56:22,439 --> 04:56:25,766
And even 10 milliseconds difference makes a huge difference.

7281
04:56:25,766 --> 04:56:28,530
You'll see it when the Formula 1 grit, for example,

7282
04:56:28,530 --> 04:56:29,670
they do a standing start

7283
04:56:29,670 --> 04:56:31,991
and you see the five red lights come on.

7284
04:56:31,991 --> 04:56:33,856
And when the last light goes out,

7285
04:56:33,856 --> 04:56:35,910
they're supposed to release the clutch

7286
04:56:35,910 --> 04:56:36,986
and get going.

7287
04:56:36,986 --> 04:56:38,550
And they can time this.

7288
04:56:38,550 --> 04:56:40,920
So you can see exactly who has the reaction time.

7289
04:56:40,920 --> 04:56:44,670
And even being off by 20 milliseconds

7290
04:56:44,670 --> 04:56:45,630
can make the difference

7291
04:56:45,630 --> 04:56:48,060
of whether you're in front or behind at the first corner.

7292
04:56:48,060 --> 04:56:51,720
- How much of winning is also just the strategy

7293
04:56:51,720 --> 04:56:53,430
of jostling for a position?

7294
04:56:53,430 --> 04:56:54,423
- There's some of that

7295
04:56:54,423 --> 04:56:55,950
and some of it is also just nerve.

7296
04:56:55,950 --> 04:56:57,330
Who wants it more?

7297
04:56:57,330 --> 04:57:00,810
That's exactly when that sense of danger comes in.

7298
04:57:00,810 --> 04:57:04,260
There's a great quote from Fernando Alonso

7299
04:57:04,260 --> 04:57:07,380
when he was driving at Suzuka

7300
04:57:07,380 --> 04:57:09,630
against Schumacher, I think.

7301
04:57:09,630 --> 04:57:12,540
They're coming up to this incredibly fast corner.

7302
04:57:12,540 --> 04:57:14,640
It's very dangerous.

7303
04:57:14,640 --> 04:57:17,760
And Alonso basically accounts

7304
04:57:17,760 --> 04:57:19,050
I was gonna make the pass

7305
04:57:19,050 --> 04:57:22,003
'cause I knew he had a wife and kids at home.

7306
04:57:22,003 --> 04:57:23,370
- That's so gangster.

7307
04:57:23,370 --> 04:57:24,595
- Just absolutely ruthless, right?

7308
04:57:24,595 --> 04:57:26,803
- Yeah, wow. - That I knew he valued

7309
04:57:26,803 --> 04:57:28,380
life more than I did.

7310
04:57:28,380 --> 04:57:31,213
So there's a bit of poker sometimes in that.

7311
04:57:31,213 --> 04:57:33,054
Who's gonna yield?

7312
04:57:33,054 --> 04:57:35,703
There's a bit of chicken raised in that regard.

7313
04:57:36,720 --> 04:57:37,950
And sometimes it doesn't work.

7314
04:57:37,950 --> 04:57:39,750
No one yields and you both crash.

7315
04:57:39,750 --> 04:57:41,820
But very often one person will blink first.

7316
04:57:41,820 --> 04:57:44,280
- Can the pass be both on the inside and the outside?

7317
04:57:44,280 --> 04:57:46,110
- You can pass wherever you want

7318
04:57:46,110 --> 04:57:49,410
as long as you have just a slight part of the car

7319
04:57:49,410 --> 04:57:50,738
on the racetrack.

7320
04:57:50,738 --> 04:57:53,893
- And then you just improvise and take risks.

7321
04:57:53,893 --> 04:57:56,070
What a sport.

7322
04:57:56,070 --> 04:58:00,570
And then Senna, of course, is like a legendary risk taker.

7323
04:58:00,570 --> 04:58:03,621
- Yes, and even before him, by the time,

7324
04:58:03,621 --> 04:58:06,480
I mean he died in the '90s.

7325
04:58:06,480 --> 04:58:08,520
But by the time we got to the '90s,

7326
04:58:08,520 --> 04:58:10,500
racing was al already a lot safer

7327
04:58:10,500 --> 04:58:13,683
than it was when Niki Lauda raced in the '60s.

7328
04:58:14,661 --> 04:58:17,490
That level of danger is no longer there.

7329
04:58:17,490 --> 04:58:19,077
There's still just a remnant of it

7330
04:58:19,077 --> 04:58:21,510
and it is still dangerous, but nothing like that.

7331
04:58:21,510 --> 04:58:24,120
And it's a little hard to compare through the ages,

7332
04:58:24,120 --> 04:58:26,610
like who's the greatest driver of all time.

7333
04:58:26,610 --> 04:58:29,250
I think there's a fair argument that Senna is,

7334
04:58:29,250 --> 04:58:30,480
but we don't have the data.

7335
04:58:30,480 --> 04:58:31,740
We don't know who he was up against.

7336
04:58:31,740 --> 04:58:33,390
Like how would he fare if we pitted him

7337
04:58:33,390 --> 04:58:35,040
against Max Verstappen today.

7338
04:58:35,040 --> 04:58:38,760
I do think sometimes that you can have a bit of a nostalgia

7339
04:58:38,760 --> 04:58:42,060
for the all time greats, but the world moves forward

7340
04:58:42,060 --> 04:58:43,650
and new records are being set all the time

7341
04:58:43,650 --> 04:58:45,803
and the professionalism keeps improving.

7342
04:58:45,803 --> 04:58:48,570
Sometimes to the detriment of the sport, I think.

7343
04:58:48,570 --> 04:58:50,280
There's a lot of professional drivers

7344
04:58:50,280 --> 04:58:52,620
who are not only just very good at driving,

7345
04:58:52,620 --> 04:58:54,990
but are very good at being corporate spokespeople.

7346
04:58:54,990 --> 04:58:56,400
And it used to be quite different.

7347
04:58:56,400 --> 04:58:58,830
There used to be more characters in racing

7348
04:58:58,830 --> 04:59:00,510
that had a bit more personality

7349
04:59:00,510 --> 04:59:01,980
that they were allowed to shine

7350
04:59:01,980 --> 04:59:04,260
because there weren't a billion sponsorships

7351
04:59:04,260 --> 04:59:06,330
on the line that they were afraid to lose.

7352
04:59:06,330 --> 04:59:07,163
- Ridiculous question,

7353
04:59:07,163 --> 04:59:09,101
what's the greatest car I ever made,

7354
04:59:09,101 --> 04:59:11,850
or maybe what's the funnest one to drive?

7355
04:59:11,850 --> 04:59:15,267
- The greatest car for me of all time is the Pagani Zonda.

7356
04:59:15,267 --> 04:59:17,940
- [Lex] Okay, I'm looking this up, Pagani Zonda.

7357
04:59:17,940 --> 04:59:19,560
- [DHH] So the Pagani Zonda

7358
04:59:19,560 --> 04:59:23,250
was made by this wonderful Argentinian

7359
04:59:23,250 --> 04:59:25,200
called Horacio Pagani.

7360
04:59:25,200 --> 04:59:26,998
- [Lex] My god, that's a beautiful car, wow.

7361
04:59:26,998 --> 04:59:28,170
- It's a gorgeous car.

7362
04:59:28,170 --> 04:59:29,010
You can look up mine.

7363
04:59:29,010 --> 04:59:31,023
It's the Pagani Zonda HH.

7364
04:59:32,460 --> 04:59:37,460
So that's a car I had made in 2010

7365
04:59:40,110 --> 04:59:44,850
after we visited the factory in Modena.

7366
04:59:44,850 --> 04:59:49,710
And by sheer accident ended up with this car,

7367
04:59:49,710 --> 04:59:52,140
but it became my favorite car in the world basically.

7368
04:59:52,140 --> 04:59:54,628
When I watched an episode of "Top Gear,"

7369
04:59:54,628 --> 04:59:59,610
I think in 2005, where one of the presenters

7370
04:59:59,610 --> 05:00:02,220
was driving the Pagani Zonda F around.

7371
05:00:02,220 --> 05:00:03,053
And I just thought,

7372
05:00:03,053 --> 05:00:05,190
that's the most beautiful car in the world.

7373
05:00:05,190 --> 05:00:08,913
It is the most incredibly sounding car in the world.

7374
05:00:09,960 --> 05:00:14,485
If I one day have the option, this is what I want.

7375
05:00:14,485 --> 05:00:16,920
And then I had the option in 2010,

7376
05:00:16,920 --> 05:00:18,030
I've had the car ever since.

7377
05:00:18,030 --> 05:00:20,160
I'm never ever gonna sell it.

7378
05:00:20,160 --> 05:00:24,390
It's truly a masterpiece that stood the test of time.

7379
05:00:24,390 --> 05:00:26,670
There's some great cars from history

7380
05:00:26,670 --> 05:00:29,040
that are recognized as being great in their time.

7381
05:00:29,040 --> 05:00:30,510
This car is still great.

7382
05:00:30,510 --> 05:00:31,980
- Have you taken on the racetrack?

7383
05:00:31,980 --> 05:00:33,690
- I have, it's terrible at that.

7384
05:00:33,690 --> 05:00:35,141
Well, I don't wanna say it's terrible that

7385
05:00:35,141 --> 05:00:37,020
that's not what it's designed for.

7386
05:00:37,020 --> 05:00:41,310
It's designed for the road and that's why it's great.

7387
05:00:41,310 --> 05:00:42,690
There are a lot of fast cars

7388
05:00:42,690 --> 05:00:45,925
that are straddling their race car for the road.

7389
05:00:45,925 --> 05:00:48,480
You don't actually want a race car for the world.

7390
05:00:48,480 --> 05:00:50,250
A race car for the world is a pain in the ass.

7391
05:00:50,250 --> 05:00:51,270
It's way too stiff.

7392
05:00:51,270 --> 05:00:52,140
It's way too loud.

7393
05:00:52,140 --> 05:00:53,100
It's way too uncomfortable.

7394
05:00:53,100 --> 05:00:55,140
You can't actually take it on a road trip.

7395
05:00:55,140 --> 05:00:56,754
- So this actually feels good driving

7396
05:00:56,754 --> 05:00:58,200
normal roads? - Totally, totally.

7397
05:00:58,200 --> 05:01:00,023
- And you of course always go to speed limit?

7398
05:01:00,023 --> 05:01:01,113
- Always.

7399
05:01:01,113 --> 05:01:03,900
This is why I love having this car in Spain

7400
05:01:03,900 --> 05:01:05,970
'cause they're a little more relaxed.

7401
05:01:05,970 --> 05:01:08,190
Not entirely relaxed, but more relaxed

7402
05:01:08,190 --> 05:01:09,420
than they are in a lot of places.

7403
05:01:09,420 --> 05:01:13,440
In Denmark, I kid you not, if you are on the highway

7404
05:01:13,440 --> 05:01:15,750
and you go more than twice the speed limit,

7405
05:01:15,750 --> 05:01:18,450
they confiscate your car and keep it.

7406
05:01:18,450 --> 05:01:19,410
You're not getting it back.

7407
05:01:19,410 --> 05:01:21,723
They don't even care if it's your car or not.

7408
05:01:21,723 --> 05:01:22,947
Like if you were boring my car

7409
05:01:22,947 --> 05:01:25,950
and you went twice the speed limit, it's gone.

7410
05:01:25,950 --> 05:01:27,810
So they don't do that in Spain.

7411
05:01:27,810 --> 05:01:31,380
I mean, in most places except for the German Autobahn,

7412
05:01:31,380 --> 05:01:33,630
they get pissy if you go twice the speed limit.

7413
05:01:33,630 --> 05:01:36,330
For all sorts of fair reasons, I'm not advocating

7414
05:01:36,330 --> 05:01:38,580
that you should be going much more than that.

7415
05:01:38,580 --> 05:01:40,080
But there are certain special roads

7416
05:01:40,080 --> 05:01:43,287
where you can't open things up and no one's in harm's way.

7417
05:01:43,287 --> 05:01:45,300
And that's an incredible sensation.

7418
05:01:45,300 --> 05:01:47,010
And I do think that some of those speed limits

7419
05:01:47,010 --> 05:01:47,970
actually are kind of silly.

7420
05:01:47,970 --> 05:01:50,190
And I'm not just saying that in a vacuum.

7421
05:01:50,190 --> 05:01:53,430
In Germany, they have the glorious Autobahn.

7422
05:01:53,430 --> 05:01:55,506
And on the Autobahn, there is no speed limit

7423
05:01:55,506 --> 05:01:57,632
in a bunch of segments.

7424
05:01:57,632 --> 05:02:01,680
And they're so committed to their speed-limitless Autobahn,

7425
05:02:01,680 --> 05:02:03,840
which is by the way, very weird of Germans.

7426
05:02:03,840 --> 05:02:05,250
They usually love rules.

7427
05:02:05,250 --> 05:02:07,200
They usually very precise about it.

7428
05:02:07,200 --> 05:02:09,540
And then they have this glorious thing called the Autobahn.

7429
05:02:09,540 --> 05:02:12,120
There was a great case a couple of years ago

7430
05:02:12,120 --> 05:02:15,330
where a guy took out a Bugatti Chiron;

7431
05:02:15,330 --> 05:02:18,270
went 400 kilometers an hour on the Autobahn

7432
05:02:18,270 --> 05:02:20,220
and he filled it and put it on YouTube

7433
05:02:20,220 --> 05:02:22,140
and a case was brought against him.

7434
05:02:22,140 --> 05:02:24,300
Because even though they don't have a speed limit,

7435
05:02:24,300 --> 05:02:26,482
they do have rules that you can't drive recklessly.

7436
05:02:26,482 --> 05:02:27,930
And he won the case.

7437
05:02:27,930 --> 05:02:28,980
He wasn't driving recklessly.

7438
05:02:28,980 --> 05:02:31,707
He was just going very, very fast.

7439
05:02:31,707 --> 05:02:34,197
I've done the Autobahn a couple of times.

7440
05:02:34,197 --> 05:02:38,264
My wife and I went on a road trip in Europe in 2009,

7441
05:02:38,264 --> 05:02:41,160
and I got the Lamborghini Gallardo.

7442
05:02:41,160 --> 05:02:43,500
We were driving up to 200 miles an hour.

7443
05:02:43,500 --> 05:02:46,020
And I'd driven 200 miles an hour

7444
05:02:46,020 --> 05:02:47,670
or close to it on a racetrack before.

7445
05:02:47,670 --> 05:02:48,960
That feels like one thing.

7446
05:02:48,960 --> 05:02:50,820
Driving on a public road, 200 miles an hour

7447
05:02:50,820 --> 05:02:52,860
feels really, really fast.

7448
05:02:52,860 --> 05:02:54,000
- Scary?

7449
05:02:54,000 --> 05:02:55,800
- Actually A little scary, yes.

7450
05:02:55,800 --> 05:02:59,010
Because you constantly think like on a racetrack,

7451
05:02:59,010 --> 05:03:00,720
you know the road, you know the surface.

7452
05:03:00,720 --> 05:03:02,340
You can walk the track most of the time.

7453
05:03:02,340 --> 05:03:03,540
You can know if there's a dip.

7454
05:03:03,540 --> 05:03:04,440
On a public road,

7455
05:03:04,440 --> 05:03:06,419
you can't know if there's suddenly a pothole.

7456
05:03:06,419 --> 05:03:08,430
Presumably there's not gonna be a pothole

7457
05:03:08,430 --> 05:03:09,570
on the German Autobahn.

7458
05:03:09,570 --> 05:03:13,440
but it does feel a little scary, but also exhilarating.

7459
05:03:13,440 --> 05:03:17,220
Speed is just intrinsically really fun.

7460
05:03:17,220 --> 05:03:19,495
I don't know anyone I've taken out in a fast car.

7461
05:03:19,495 --> 05:03:21,510
Well, actually I do know a few people.

7462
05:03:21,510 --> 05:03:24,260
Most people I take out in a fast car, they grin.

7463
05:03:24,260 --> 05:03:28,520
It's a human reaction to grin when you go really fast.

7464
05:03:28,520 --> 05:03:30,539
- Do you know what the fastest you've ever gone?

7465
05:03:30,539 --> 05:03:32,010
- I was probably at Le Mans,

7466
05:03:32,010 --> 05:03:35,370
I think when the LMP2s were at their maximum power

7467
05:03:35,370 --> 05:03:37,920
and had 600 horsepower and really sticky tires,

7468
05:03:37,920 --> 05:03:40,590
we were going 340 kilometers an hour,

7469
05:03:40,590 --> 05:03:43,170
which is just over 200 miles an hour.

7470
05:03:43,170 --> 05:03:44,709
A bit over 200 miles an hour.

7471
05:03:44,709 --> 05:03:47,130
That does feel fast.

7472
05:03:47,130 --> 05:03:48,600
And it's really interesting with speed

7473
05:03:48,600 --> 05:03:51,711
is that the difference between going, let's say 150

7474
05:03:51,711 --> 05:03:55,620
and 160 doesn't feel that much

7475
05:03:55,620 --> 05:03:57,960
actually those 10 mile an hour.

7476
05:03:57,960 --> 05:04:00,570
But the difference between going 190 and 200

7477
05:04:00,570 --> 05:04:02,719
feels crazy faster,

7478
05:04:02,719 --> 05:04:05,340
which as a percentage change is actually less

7479
05:04:05,340 --> 05:04:07,758
than going from 150 to 160.

7480
05:04:07,758 --> 05:04:11,010
But there's some sense of exponentiality

7481
05:04:11,010 --> 05:04:13,015
once you get up to those limits

7482
05:04:13,015 --> 05:04:16,020
where it's just on a complete different level.

7483
05:04:16,020 --> 05:04:20,564
- Yeah, 'cause to me like 110, 120 feels fast.

7484
05:04:20,564 --> 05:04:25,564
200? that's crazy. - It really is crazy.

7485
05:04:26,053 --> 05:04:30,990
- I gotta ask you about the details

7486
05:04:30,990 --> 05:04:33,240
of your programming setup, the IDE,

7487
05:04:33,240 --> 05:04:34,710
all that kind of stuff.

7488
05:04:34,710 --> 05:04:39,030
Let's paint the picture of the perfect programming setup.

7489
05:04:39,030 --> 05:04:41,730
Do you have a programming setup that you enjoy?

7490
05:04:41,730 --> 05:04:43,080
Are you very flexible?

7491
05:04:43,080 --> 05:04:44,873
Like how many monitors?

7492
05:04:44,873 --> 05:04:46,620
What kind of keyboard?

7493
05:04:46,620 --> 05:04:48,128
What kind of chair?

7494
05:04:48,128 --> 05:04:50,495
What kind of desk?

7495
05:04:50,495 --> 05:04:53,580
- It's funny because if you'd asked me,

7496
05:04:53,580 --> 05:04:55,590
let's see, a year and a half ago,

7497
05:04:55,590 --> 05:04:57,300
I would've given you the same answer

7498
05:04:57,300 --> 05:05:00,393
as I would've given anyone for basically 20 years.

7499
05:05:01,380 --> 05:05:03,030
I want a Mac.

7500
05:05:03,030 --> 05:05:05,553
I like the Magic Keyboard.

7501
05:05:06,690 --> 05:05:09,720
I like the single monitor.

7502
05:05:09,720 --> 05:05:14,190
Apple makes an awesome 6K 32-inch XDR screen

7503
05:05:14,190 --> 05:05:15,570
that I still haven't found anyone

7504
05:05:15,570 --> 05:05:17,309
who've beaten that I still use,

7505
05:05:17,309 --> 05:05:19,410
even though I switched away from Apple computers.

7506
05:05:19,410 --> 05:05:22,260
I still use their monitor because it's just fantastic.

7507
05:05:22,260 --> 05:05:25,020
But I've always been a single screen kind of guy.

7508
05:05:25,020 --> 05:05:26,220
I do like a big screen,

7509
05:05:26,220 --> 05:05:27,780
but I don't want multiple screens.

7510
05:05:27,780 --> 05:05:29,760
I've never found that that really works

7511
05:05:29,760 --> 05:05:32,130
with my perception.

7512
05:05:32,130 --> 05:05:34,350
I wanna be able to just focus on a single thing.

7513
05:05:34,350 --> 05:05:36,060
I don't want all of it all over the place.

7514
05:05:36,060 --> 05:05:38,610
And I've always used multiple virtual desktops

7515
05:05:38,610 --> 05:05:40,110
and being able to switch back and forth

7516
05:05:40,110 --> 05:05:41,490
between those things.

7517
05:05:41,490 --> 05:05:45,540
But the setup I have today is Linux.

7518
05:05:45,540 --> 05:05:47,520
I switched to a little over a year ago

7519
05:05:47,520 --> 05:05:50,199
after I finally got fed up with Apple enough

7520
05:05:50,199 --> 05:05:52,478
that I couldn't do that anymore.

7521
05:05:52,478 --> 05:05:57,478
And then I use this low profile mechanical keyboard

7522
05:05:57,685 --> 05:06:02,447
called the Lofree Flow84,

7523
05:06:02,447 --> 05:06:05,220
which is just the most glorious

7524
05:06:05,220 --> 05:06:08,190
sounding keyboard I've ever heard.

7525
05:06:08,190 --> 05:06:10,080
I know there are a lot of connoisseurs

7526
05:06:10,080 --> 05:06:11,580
of mechanical keyboards

7527
05:06:11,580 --> 05:06:13,020
that'll probably contest me on this.

7528
05:06:13,020 --> 05:06:16,470
This is too thy or too clicky or too clocky or whatever.

7529
05:06:16,470 --> 05:06:21,091
But for me, the Lofree Flow84

7530
05:06:21,091 --> 05:06:24,786
is just a delight that I did not even know existed.

7531
05:06:24,786 --> 05:06:26,610
Which is so funny because I mean,

7532
05:06:26,610 --> 05:06:27,990
I've been programming for a long time.

7533
05:06:27,990 --> 05:06:30,931
Mechanical keyboards have been a thing for a long time.

7534
05:06:30,931 --> 05:06:32,273
And the keyboard, when you look at it like this,

7535
05:06:32,273 --> 05:06:34,830
it just kind of, it looks plain,

7536
05:06:34,830 --> 05:06:36,450
it doesn't look extravagant.

7537
05:06:36,450 --> 05:06:39,151
But the tactile sensation

7538
05:06:39,151 --> 05:06:42,900
you get out of pushing those keys, the talky sound

7539
05:06:42,900 --> 05:06:45,137
that you hear when the keys hit the board.

7540
05:06:45,137 --> 05:06:46,710
It's just sublime.

7541
05:06:46,710 --> 05:06:48,930
And I'm kicking myself

7542
05:06:48,930 --> 05:06:53,700
that I was in this Mac bubble for so long

7543
05:06:53,700 --> 05:06:56,761
that I wasn't even in the market to find this.

7544
05:06:56,761 --> 05:06:59,400
I knew mechanical keyboards existed,

7545
05:06:59,400 --> 05:07:02,550
but to be blunt, I thought it was a bit of a nerd thing

7546
05:07:02,550 --> 05:07:05,250
that only real nerds that were much more nerdy

7547
05:07:05,250 --> 05:07:07,263
than me would ever care about.

7548
05:07:07,263 --> 05:07:09,390
And then I got out of the Apple bubble

7549
05:07:09,390 --> 05:07:11,010
and suddenly I had to find everything again.

7550
05:07:11,010 --> 05:07:12,150
I had to find a new mouse,

7551
05:07:12,150 --> 05:07:13,290
I had to find a new keyboard,

7552
05:07:13,290 --> 05:07:14,430
I had to find everything.

7553
05:07:14,430 --> 05:07:15,420
And I thought like, all right,

7554
05:07:15,420 --> 05:07:17,160
let me give mechanical keyboards a try.

7555
05:07:17,160 --> 05:07:19,210
And I gave quite a few of them a try.

7556
05:07:19,210 --> 05:07:21,600
The Keychron is one of the big brands

7557
05:07:21,600 --> 05:07:23,310
in that I didn't like that at all.

7558
05:07:23,310 --> 05:07:25,110
I tried a bunch of other keyboards

7559
05:07:25,110 --> 05:07:26,530
and then I finally found this keyboard

7560
05:07:26,530 --> 05:07:30,030
and I just went like, angels are singing.

7561
05:07:30,030 --> 05:07:31,440
Where have you been my whole life?

7562
05:07:31,440 --> 05:07:33,840
We spent as programmers so much of our time

7563
05:07:33,840 --> 05:07:35,160
interacting with those keys.

7564
05:07:35,160 --> 05:07:36,450
It really kind of matters

7565
05:07:36,450 --> 05:07:37,950
in a way I didn't fully appreciate.

7566
05:07:37,950 --> 05:07:41,910
I used to defend the Apple Magic Keyboard,

7567
05:07:41,910 --> 05:07:43,052
like hey, it's great.

7568
05:07:43,052 --> 05:07:43,885
It's actually a great keyboard.

7569
05:07:43,885 --> 05:07:46,290
And I think for what it is, this ultra-low profile,

7570
05:07:46,290 --> 05:07:48,832
ultra low travel is actually a really nice keyboard.

7571
05:07:48,832 --> 05:07:51,840
But once you've tried a longer travel

7572
05:07:51,840 --> 05:07:53,947
mechanical keyboard, there's no going back.

7573
05:07:53,947 --> 05:07:56,639
- You do have to remember in many ways,

7574
05:07:56,639 --> 05:07:59,223
both on the software side and the hardware side,

7575
05:07:59,223 --> 05:08:02,700
that you do spend a lot of hour behind the computer.

7576
05:08:02,700 --> 05:08:04,500
It's worth... - It's worth investing in.

7577
05:08:04,500 --> 05:08:05,750
- And also worth exploring

7578
05:08:05,750 --> 05:08:07,380
until you find the thing

7579
05:08:07,380 --> 05:08:08,837
where the angels starts singing, whatever.

7580
05:08:08,837 --> 05:08:10,140
- That's exactly right.

7581
05:08:10,140 --> 05:08:12,615
And I actually do regret that a little bit,

7582
05:08:12,615 --> 05:08:14,063
especially with this damn keyboard.

7583
05:08:14,063 --> 05:08:16,532
I mean, I could have been listening

7584
05:08:16,532 --> 05:08:19,778
to these beautiful thocky keys for years and years,

7585
05:08:19,778 --> 05:08:23,494
but sometimes you have to get really off

7586
05:08:23,494 --> 05:08:25,050
before you open your eyes

7587
05:08:25,050 --> 05:08:26,550
and see that something else exists.

7588
05:08:26,550 --> 05:08:28,260
I feel the same way about Linux.

7589
05:08:28,260 --> 05:08:31,320
So I've been using Linux on the server

7590
05:08:31,320 --> 05:08:34,500
since late '90s, probably.

7591
05:08:34,500 --> 05:08:36,450
We ran servers on Linux back then.

7592
05:08:36,450 --> 05:08:39,810
I never seriously considered it as a desktop option.

7593
05:08:39,810 --> 05:08:42,585
I never ran Linux before, directly myself.

7594
05:08:42,585 --> 05:08:44,480
I always thought, you know what?

7595
05:08:44,480 --> 05:08:46,290
I wanna focus on programming.

7596
05:08:46,290 --> 05:08:48,390
I don't have time for all these configuration files

7597
05:08:48,390 --> 05:08:50,400
and all this setup bullshit and whatnot.

7598
05:08:50,400 --> 05:08:52,050
And Apple is close enough.

7599
05:08:52,050 --> 05:08:53,970
It's built on Unix underpinnings.

7600
05:08:53,970 --> 05:08:55,979
Why do I need to bother with Linux?

7601
05:08:55,979 --> 05:08:58,530
And again, it was one of those things.

7602
05:08:58,530 --> 05:09:01,742
I needed to try new things and try something else

7603
05:09:01,742 --> 05:09:06,742
to realize that there is other things other than Apple.

7604
05:09:08,610 --> 05:09:09,960
And again, it's not 'cause I hate Apple.

7605
05:09:09,960 --> 05:09:11,550
I think they still make good computers.

7606
05:09:11,550 --> 05:09:13,500
I think a lot of the software

7607
05:09:13,500 --> 05:09:15,142
is still also pretty okay.

7608
05:09:15,142 --> 05:09:18,180
But I have come to realize that as a web developer,

7609
05:09:18,180 --> 05:09:20,100
Linux is just better.

7610
05:09:20,100 --> 05:09:20,940
Linux is just better.

7611
05:09:20,940 --> 05:09:23,490
It's closer to what I deploy on.

7612
05:09:23,490 --> 05:09:25,358
The tooling is actually phenomenal.

7613
05:09:25,358 --> 05:09:28,113
And if you spend a bit of time setting it up,

7614
05:09:28,980 --> 05:09:32,760
you can record a reproducible environment

7615
05:09:32,760 --> 05:09:35,610
that I've now done with this Omakub concept

7616
05:09:35,610 --> 05:09:37,260
or project that I've done,

7617
05:09:37,260 --> 05:09:39,210
that I can set up a new Linux machine

7618
05:09:39,210 --> 05:09:40,860
in less than 30 minutes.

7619
05:09:40,860 --> 05:09:41,910
And it's perfect.

7620
05:09:41,910 --> 05:09:43,280
It's not pretty good.

7621
05:09:43,280 --> 05:09:44,580
It's not like I still need to spend two hours on.

7622
05:09:44,580 --> 05:09:46,873
It's perfect because you can code all aspects

7623
05:09:46,873 --> 05:09:50,074
of the development environment into this.

7624
05:09:50,074 --> 05:09:51,690
And I didn't know.

7625
05:09:51,690 --> 05:09:53,739
I didn't even know, to be fair,

7626
05:09:53,739 --> 05:09:56,550
that Linux could look as good as it can.

7627
05:09:56,550 --> 05:10:00,480
If you look at a stock Ubuntu or Fedora boot,

7628
05:10:00,480 --> 05:10:02,040
I mean, not that it's ugly,

7629
05:10:02,040 --> 05:10:04,438
but I'd pick the Mac any day of the week.

7630
05:10:04,438 --> 05:10:06,443
You look at Omakub,

7631
05:10:06,443 --> 05:10:08,070
I mean, I'm biased here, of course,

7632
05:10:08,070 --> 05:10:09,630
'cause I built it with my own sensibilities.

7633
05:10:09,630 --> 05:10:12,360
But I look at that and go like, this is better.

7634
05:10:12,360 --> 05:10:13,620
This is beautiful.

7635
05:10:13,620 --> 05:10:15,240
And then you look at some of those true

7636
05:10:15,240 --> 05:10:19,320
Linux rising setups where people go nuts with everything

7637
05:10:19,320 --> 05:10:22,650
and you go, oh yeah, I remember when computers

7638
05:10:22,650 --> 05:10:24,060
used to be fun in this way,

7639
05:10:24,060 --> 05:10:26,640
when there was this individuality and this setup.

7640
05:10:26,640 --> 05:10:30,724
And it wasn't just all planned the sameness.

7641
05:10:30,724 --> 05:10:32,100
And I think that's the flip side

7642
05:10:32,100 --> 05:10:33,600
sometimes of something like Apple,

7643
05:10:33,600 --> 05:10:35,160
where they have really strong opinions

7644
05:10:35,160 --> 05:10:36,570
and they have really good opinions,

7645
05:10:36,570 --> 05:10:37,680
they have very good taste.

7646
05:10:37,680 --> 05:10:38,760
And it looks very nice

7647
05:10:38,760 --> 05:10:40,470
and it also looks totally the same.

7648
05:10:40,470 --> 05:10:42,330
And Linux has far more variety

7649
05:10:42,330 --> 05:10:44,610
and far more texture and flavor.

7650
05:10:44,610 --> 05:10:47,137
Sometimes also annoyances and bugs and whatever.

7651
05:10:47,137 --> 05:10:49,470
But I run Linux now.

7652
05:10:49,470 --> 05:10:52,737
It's Ubuntu-based with the Omakub stuff on top.

7653
05:10:52,737 --> 05:10:54,660
The low free keyboard.

7654
05:10:54,660 --> 05:10:58,215
I use a Logitech, what's it called?

7655
05:10:58,215 --> 05:11:02,128
The MX 3 mouse, which I love how it feels in my hand.

7656
05:11:02,128 --> 05:11:03,750
I don't love how it looks.

7657
05:11:03,750 --> 05:11:08,310
I actually was a Magic Mouse stan for the longest time.

7658
05:11:08,310 --> 05:11:09,450
I thought it was genius

7659
05:11:09,450 --> 05:11:12,627
that Apple integrated the track pad into a mouse,

7660
05:11:12,627 --> 05:11:13,920
and I used that.

7661
05:11:13,920 --> 05:11:15,720
And I always thought it was ridiculous

7662
05:11:15,720 --> 05:11:17,130
that people would slag it

7663
05:11:17,130 --> 05:11:19,500
just because you had to charge it by flipping it over.

7664
05:11:19,500 --> 05:11:21,990
'Cause the battery would last for three months

7665
05:11:21,990 --> 05:11:23,760
and then you'd charge it for half an hour.

7666
05:11:23,760 --> 05:11:25,629
I thought like, that's a perfect

7667
05:11:25,629 --> 05:11:27,720
compatibility with my sensibilities.

7668
05:11:27,720 --> 05:11:30,150
I don't mind giving up a little inconvenience

7669
05:11:30,150 --> 05:11:31,110
if something is beautiful,

7670
05:11:31,110 --> 05:11:32,400
and that Magic Mouse is beautiful.

7671
05:11:32,400 --> 05:11:33,860
But it wasn't gonna work on Linux.

7672
05:11:33,860 --> 05:11:35,743
So I found something else.

7673
05:11:35,743 --> 05:11:36,810
The S3 is nice,

7674
05:11:36,810 --> 05:11:39,660
but I sometimes do wish like the Magic Mouse.

7675
05:11:39,660 --> 05:11:40,650
That's pretty good.

7676
05:11:40,650 --> 05:11:42,240
- Yeah, Linux is really great

7677
05:11:42,240 --> 05:11:44,490
for customizing everything, for tiling,

7678
05:11:44,490 --> 05:11:45,567
for macros, for all of that.

7679
05:11:45,567 --> 05:11:48,780
And I also do the same in Windows with AutoHotKey

7680
05:11:48,780 --> 05:11:50,742
or just customize the whole thing

7681
05:11:50,742 --> 05:11:52,255
to your preferences.

7682
05:11:52,255 --> 05:11:53,910
- If you're a developer,

7683
05:11:53,910 --> 05:11:55,950
you should learn how to control your environment

7684
05:11:55,950 --> 05:11:56,850
with the keyboard.

7685
05:11:58,298 --> 05:12:00,810
It's faster, it's more fluid.

7686
05:12:00,810 --> 05:12:02,880
I think one of those silly things

7687
05:12:02,880 --> 05:12:05,847
I've come to truly appreciate about my Omakub setup

7688
05:12:05,847 --> 05:12:08,730
is that I can, in whatever time

7689
05:12:08,730 --> 05:12:10,140
it takes to refresh the screen,

7690
05:12:10,140 --> 05:12:11,550
probably five milliseconds

7691
05:12:11,550 --> 05:12:14,478
switch from one virtual desktop to another.

7692
05:12:14,478 --> 05:12:18,063
Even on Windows, you can't get it that smooth.

7693
05:12:18,063 --> 05:12:18,896
You can get close,

7694
05:12:18,896 --> 05:12:20,550
you can't get it that smooth.

7695
05:12:20,550 --> 05:12:23,520
On macOS, for whatever reason,

7696
05:12:23,520 --> 05:12:27,660
Apple insists on having this infuriating animation

7697
05:12:27,660 --> 05:12:29,400
when you switch between virtual desktops,

7698
05:12:29,400 --> 05:12:31,470
which makes it just that you don't want to.

7699
05:12:31,470 --> 05:12:33,540
You don't wanna run full screen apps

7700
05:12:33,540 --> 05:12:35,220
because it's too cumbersome to switch

7701
05:12:35,220 --> 05:12:36,570
between the virtual desktops.

7702
05:12:36,570 --> 05:12:39,150
The kind of immediacy that you can get

7703
05:12:39,150 --> 05:12:42,240
from a wonderful Linux setup in that regard,

7704
05:12:42,240 --> 05:12:43,554
it's just next level.

7705
05:12:43,554 --> 05:12:45,390
- Yeah, and it seems like a subtle thing,

7706
05:12:45,390 --> 05:12:48,390
but you know, difference in milliseconds and latency

7707
05:12:48,390 --> 05:12:51,840
between switching the virtual desktops, for example.

7708
05:12:51,840 --> 05:12:53,033
I don't know, it changes...

7709
05:12:53,033 --> 05:12:54,960
- It changes how you use the computer.

7710
05:12:54,960 --> 05:12:55,793
It really does.

7711
05:12:55,793 --> 05:12:57,240
- Similar thing with VR, right?

7712
05:12:57,240 --> 05:12:58,680
If there's some kind of latency

7713
05:12:58,680 --> 05:13:01,312
or like it just completely takes you all out of it.

7714
05:13:01,312 --> 05:13:03,630
- And it's funny, I actually had to watch,

7715
05:13:03,630 --> 05:13:06,540
I think it was ThePrimeagen on YouTube

7716
05:13:06,540 --> 05:13:09,030
when he was showing off his setup

7717
05:13:09,030 --> 05:13:10,170
and I was seeing how quickly

7718
05:13:10,170 --> 05:13:12,090
he was switching between those virtual desktops.

7719
05:13:12,090 --> 05:13:14,220
And I'd always been using virtual desktops,

7720
05:13:14,220 --> 05:13:15,750
but I didn't like switching too much

7721
05:13:15,750 --> 05:13:16,583
because just of that latency

7722
05:13:16,583 --> 05:13:19,200
and it's like, oh, you can do that on Linux?

7723
05:13:19,200 --> 05:13:20,760
Oh, that's pretty cool.

7724
05:13:20,760 --> 05:13:22,620
So I run that, and then my editor

7725
05:13:22,620 --> 05:13:24,900
of choice now is Neovim.

7726
05:13:24,900 --> 05:13:25,920
- Oh good, all right.

7727
05:13:25,920 --> 05:13:27,270
Well we're out of time.

7728
05:13:27,270 --> 05:13:29,850
No, all right, you did for many, many years.

7729
05:13:29,850 --> 05:13:31,508
You used, what is it? TextMate.

7730
05:13:31,508 --> 05:13:32,927
- Yes, TextMate. - TextMate, yeah.

7731
05:13:32,927 --> 05:13:34,860
- That was actually, that was the main blocker

7732
05:13:34,860 --> 05:13:36,690
of moving away from Apple.

7733
05:13:36,690 --> 05:13:38,190
Everything else I thought, do you know what?

7734
05:13:38,190 --> 05:13:39,300
I can swing it.

7735
05:13:39,300 --> 05:13:43,938
But TextMate was and is a wonderful editor.

7736
05:13:43,938 --> 05:13:47,178
One, I helped birth into this world.

7737
05:13:47,178 --> 05:13:51,510
The programmer Allan Odgaard is a good friend of mine,

7738
05:13:51,510 --> 05:13:53,760
all the way back from the party days

7739
05:13:53,760 --> 05:13:55,710
when we were lugging our computers around.

7740
05:13:55,710 --> 05:13:57,390
And he was a big Mac guy.

7741
05:13:57,390 --> 05:14:01,523
And in 2005, he was writing this editor

7742
05:14:01,523 --> 05:14:04,680
and I helped him with the project management

7743
05:14:04,680 --> 05:14:06,420
of kind of keeping him on track,

7744
05:14:06,420 --> 05:14:08,040
keeping him focused on getting something released.

7745
05:14:08,040 --> 05:14:10,530
Because I really wanted it for myself.

7746
05:14:10,530 --> 05:14:13,110
And I thought, this was the last editor

7747
05:14:13,110 --> 05:14:14,760
I thought I was never gonna switch.

7748
05:14:14,760 --> 05:14:15,960
- Forgive me for not knowing,

7749
05:14:15,960 --> 05:14:19,980
but how featureful as this editor is this?

7750
05:14:19,980 --> 05:14:21,087
- It's quite featureful,

7751
05:14:21,087 --> 05:14:26,087
but it's a GUI-driven editor in some regards.

7752
05:14:26,730 --> 05:14:31,650
It was really early on with ways of recording macros

7753
05:14:31,650 --> 05:14:35,520
and having sort of sophisticated syntax highlighting.

7754
05:14:35,520 --> 05:14:36,600
And it did a bunch of firsts

7755
05:14:36,600 --> 05:14:40,260
and it was just a really pleasant editing experience.

7756
05:14:40,260 --> 05:14:42,240
I think these days a lot of people

7757
05:14:42,240 --> 05:14:43,890
would just use VS Code.

7758
05:14:43,890 --> 05:14:47,160
VS Codes exist in the same universe as TextMate

7759
05:14:47,160 --> 05:14:48,060
in some ways.

7760
05:14:48,060 --> 05:14:49,770
And actually I think is compatible

7761
05:14:49,770 --> 05:14:51,930
with the original TextMate bundles,

7762
05:14:51,930 --> 05:14:53,370
the original TextMate format.

7763
05:14:53,370 --> 05:14:55,430
So it really trailed a path there,

7764
05:14:55,430 --> 05:14:58,710
but it also just didn't evolve.

7765
05:14:58,710 --> 05:15:00,633
Now a lot of people saw a huge problem with that.

7766
05:15:00,633 --> 05:15:02,670
They were like, "Oh, it needs to have more features.

7767
05:15:02,670 --> 05:15:04,114
It needs to have all these things."

7768
05:15:04,114 --> 05:15:05,820
I was like, I'm happy with this text editor.

7769
05:15:05,820 --> 05:15:07,110
That hasn't changed at all.

7770
05:15:07,110 --> 05:15:09,150
Basically when Allan stopped working on it

7771
05:15:09,150 --> 05:15:10,680
for a decade or more.

7772
05:15:10,680 --> 05:15:12,249
I don't need anything else.

7773
05:15:12,249 --> 05:15:14,310
Because as our original discussion went,

7774
05:15:14,310 --> 05:15:15,703
I don't want an IDE.

7775
05:15:15,703 --> 05:15:19,680
I don't want the editor to write code for me.

7776
05:15:19,680 --> 05:15:21,210
I want to text editor.

7777
05:15:21,210 --> 05:15:24,759
I want interact with characters directly.

7778
05:15:24,759 --> 05:15:28,470
And Neovim allows me to do that in some ways

7779
05:15:28,470 --> 05:15:30,420
that are even better than TextMate.

7780
05:15:30,420 --> 05:15:33,894
And I love TextMate, but Vi as you know.

7781
05:15:33,894 --> 05:15:36,541
Once you learn the commands and it sounds,

7782
05:15:36,541 --> 05:15:39,180
I sometimes feel like Vi fans overplay

7783
05:15:39,180 --> 05:15:40,560
how difficult it is to learn

7784
05:15:40,560 --> 05:15:44,130
because it makes them perhaps seem kind of more awesome

7785
05:15:44,130 --> 05:15:45,780
that they were able to do it.

7786
05:15:45,780 --> 05:15:47,280
It's not that difficult.

7787
05:15:47,280 --> 05:15:49,560
And it doesn't take that long, in my opinion,

7788
05:15:49,560 --> 05:15:52,208
to learn just enough combo moves

7789
05:15:52,208 --> 05:15:54,571
to get that high of holy shit,

7790
05:15:54,571 --> 05:15:56,490
I could not do this in any other editor.

7791
05:15:56,490 --> 05:15:57,450
- How long did it take you?

7792
05:15:57,450 --> 05:16:00,000
And by the way, I don't know, I haven't yet.

7793
05:16:00,000 --> 05:16:01,470
Oh, I know, intellectually.

7794
05:16:01,470 --> 05:16:02,850
But just like with kids,

7795
05:16:04,740 --> 05:16:07,020
I haven't gone in all the way in.

7796
05:16:07,020 --> 05:16:08,418
I haven't used Vim.

7797
05:16:08,418 --> 05:16:09,723
- You have a treat in mind.

7798
05:16:09,723 --> 05:16:12,210
Well, I switched in about,

7799
05:16:12,210 --> 05:16:15,360
I had three days when I switched here about a year ago.

7800
05:16:15,360 --> 05:16:17,130
I had three days of cursing

7801
05:16:17,130 --> 05:16:19,260
where I thought it was absolutely terrible

7802
05:16:19,260 --> 05:16:20,670
and it was never gonna happen.

7803
05:16:20,670 --> 05:16:22,271
And I had three days of annoyance

7804
05:16:22,271 --> 05:16:24,900
and already the next week I was like, this is sweet.

7805
05:16:24,900 --> 05:16:26,307
I'm not going anywhere.

7806
05:16:26,307 --> 05:16:28,770
But I also had a bit of a head start about

7807
05:16:28,770 --> 05:16:31,170
20 years ago in early 2000s.

7808
05:16:31,170 --> 05:16:35,846
I tried Vim for like a summer and it didn't stick.

7809
05:16:35,846 --> 05:16:38,103
I didn't for whatever reason love it at the time.

7810
05:16:38,103 --> 05:16:39,403
But Neovim is really good.

7811
05:16:39,403 --> 05:16:42,480
The key to Neovim is to realize

7812
05:16:42,480 --> 05:16:44,552
that you don't have to build the whole editor yourself.

7813
05:16:44,552 --> 05:16:46,290
There's a lot of Neovim stans are like,

7814
05:16:46,290 --> 05:16:49,200
here's how to write the conflict from scratch.

7815
05:16:49,200 --> 05:16:52,062
Over 17 episodes, that's gonna take you three weeks.

7816
05:16:52,062 --> 05:16:54,510
Ah, I don't care that much.

7817
05:16:54,510 --> 05:16:55,560
I love a great editor.

7818
05:16:55,560 --> 05:16:57,975
I love to tailor it a little bit, but not that much.

7819
05:16:57,975 --> 05:17:02,739
So you have to pair Neovim with this thing called LazyVim.

7820
05:17:02,739 --> 05:17:07,650
Lazyvim.org is a distribution for Neovim

7821
05:17:07,650 --> 05:17:09,060
that takes all the drudgery

7822
05:17:09,060 --> 05:17:11,400
out of getting an amazing editor

7823
05:17:11,400 --> 05:17:13,083
experience right out of the box.

7824
05:17:14,280 --> 05:17:15,780
- Ridiculous question, we talked about

7825
05:17:15,780 --> 05:17:18,060
a bunch of programming languages.

7826
05:17:18,060 --> 05:17:19,770
You told us how much you love JavaScript.

7827
05:17:19,770 --> 05:17:22,823
It's your second favorite programming language.

7828
05:17:22,823 --> 05:17:25,999
Would TypeScript be the third then?

7829
05:17:25,999 --> 05:17:28,783
- TypeScript wouldn't even be in this universe.

7830
05:17:28,783 --> 05:17:32,310
I hate TypeScript as much as I like JavaScript.

7831
05:17:32,310 --> 05:17:35,430
- So what you hate, oh man,

7832
05:17:35,430 --> 05:17:37,353
I'm not smart enough to understand the math of that.

7833
05:17:37,353 --> 05:17:41,043
Okay, before I ask about other programming languages,

7834
05:17:42,180 --> 05:17:46,350
if you can encapsulate your hatred of TypeScript

7835
05:17:46,350 --> 05:17:48,423
into something that could be human interpretable,

7836
05:17:48,423 --> 05:17:50,400
what would be the reasoning?

7837
05:17:50,400 --> 05:17:53,490
- The JavaScript smells a lot like Ruby

7838
05:17:53,490 --> 05:17:57,270
when it comes to some aspects of its metaprogramming.

7839
05:17:57,270 --> 05:17:59,400
And TypeScript just complicates that

7840
05:17:59,400 --> 05:18:01,161
to an infuriating degree

7841
05:18:01,161 --> 05:18:03,750
when you're trying to write that kind of code.

7842
05:18:03,750 --> 05:18:05,130
And even when you're trying to write

7843
05:18:05,130 --> 05:18:06,600
the normal kind of code,

7844
05:18:06,600 --> 05:18:09,180
none of the benefits that accrue to people who like it.

7845
05:18:09,180 --> 05:18:12,090
Like auto completion is something I care about.

7846
05:18:12,090 --> 05:18:13,920
I don't care about auto completion

7847
05:18:13,920 --> 05:18:15,057
because I'm not using an IDE.

7848
05:18:15,057 --> 05:18:17,640
Now I understand that that is part

7849
05:18:17,640 --> 05:18:19,649
of what separates it and why.

7850
05:18:19,649 --> 05:18:21,330
I don't see the benefits.

7851
05:18:21,330 --> 05:18:22,620
I only see the costs.

7852
05:18:22,620 --> 05:18:23,880
I see the extra typing.

7853
05:18:23,880 --> 05:18:28,050
I see the type gymnastics that you sometimes have to do

7854
05:18:28,050 --> 05:18:30,060
and where a bunch of people give up

7855
05:18:30,060 --> 05:18:32,010
and just do any instead, right?

7856
05:18:32,010 --> 05:18:34,140
Like that they don't actually use the type system

7857
05:18:34,140 --> 05:18:35,910
because it's just too frustrating to use.

7858
05:18:35,910 --> 05:18:39,570
So I've ever only felt the frustration of TypeScript

7859
05:18:39,570 --> 05:18:43,386
and the obfuscation of TypeScript in the code

7860
05:18:43,386 --> 05:18:46,470
that gave me no payoff.

7861
05:18:46,470 --> 05:18:48,750
Again, I understand that there is a payoff.

7862
05:18:48,750 --> 05:18:50,100
I don't want the payoff.

7863
05:18:50,100 --> 05:18:51,840
So for my situation,

7864
05:18:51,840 --> 05:18:53,580
I'm not willing to make the trade

7865
05:18:53,580 --> 05:18:57,810
and I'm not willing to take a language that underneath

7866
05:18:57,810 --> 05:19:01,890
is as dynamic of a language as rubious

7867
05:19:01,890 --> 05:19:03,900
and then turn it into this pretend

7868
05:19:03,900 --> 05:19:05,070
statically type language.

7869
05:19:05,070 --> 05:19:07,977
I find that just intellectually insulting.

7870
05:19:07,977 --> 05:19:09,368
- Do you think it will

7871
05:19:09,368 --> 05:19:11,940
and do you think it should die TypeScript?

7872
05:19:11,940 --> 05:19:13,170
- I don't wanna take something away

7873
05:19:13,170 --> 05:19:14,987
from people who enjoy it.

7874
05:19:14,987 --> 05:19:17,130
So if you like TypeScript, all the most part of you.

7875
05:19:17,130 --> 05:19:19,170
If you using TypeScript because you think

7876
05:19:19,170 --> 05:19:21,857
that's what a professional program is supposed to do,

7877
05:19:21,857 --> 05:19:23,310
here's my permission,

7878
05:19:23,310 --> 05:19:24,630
you don't have to use TypeScript.

7879
05:19:24,630 --> 05:19:28,590
- There's something deeply enjoyable about

7880
05:19:28,590 --> 05:19:31,440
a brilliant programmer such as yourself,

7881
05:19:31,440 --> 05:19:32,850
DHH is talking shit.

7882
05:19:32,850 --> 05:19:35,853
It's like one of my favorite things in life.

7883
05:19:36,810 --> 05:19:39,090
What are the top three programming languages

7884
05:19:39,090 --> 05:19:40,110
everyone should learn

7885
05:19:40,110 --> 05:19:41,760
if you're talking to a beginner?

7886
05:19:41,760 --> 05:19:43,488
- I would 100% start with Ruby.

7887
05:19:43,488 --> 05:19:46,260
It is magic for beginners

7888
05:19:46,260 --> 05:19:48,540
in terms of just understanding the core concepts

7889
05:19:48,540 --> 05:19:51,090
of conditionals and loops and whatever,

7890
05:19:51,090 --> 05:19:52,770
because it makes it so easy.

7891
05:19:52,770 --> 05:19:55,170
Even if you're just making a shell program

7892
05:19:55,170 --> 05:19:57,930
that's outputting to the terminal,

7893
05:19:57,930 --> 05:20:00,480
getting hello-world running in Ruby

7894
05:20:00,480 --> 05:20:05,366
is basically puts, P-U-T-S, space, start quotes,

7895
05:20:05,366 --> 05:20:07,950
hello world, end quotes, you're done, right?

7896
05:20:07,950 --> 05:20:09,540
There's no fluff.

7897
05:20:09,540 --> 05:20:10,890
There's nothing to wrap it into.

7898
05:20:10,890 --> 05:20:12,450
There are other languages that does that,

7899
05:20:12,450 --> 05:20:14,490
especially in the Perl or Python

7900
05:20:14,490 --> 05:20:16,470
would be rather similar.

7901
05:20:16,470 --> 05:20:18,720
But Go would not, Java would not.

7902
05:20:18,720 --> 05:20:20,070
There's a lot of other languages

7903
05:20:20,070 --> 05:20:22,680
that have a lot more ceremony and boilerplate.

7904
05:20:22,680 --> 05:20:23,760
Ruby has none of it.

7905
05:20:23,760 --> 05:20:26,190
So it's a wonderful starting language.

7906
05:20:26,190 --> 05:20:29,220
There's a book called "Learn to Program"

7907
05:20:29,220 --> 05:20:31,950
by Pine that uses Ruby

7908
05:20:31,950 --> 05:20:35,340
essentially to just teach basic programming principles

7909
05:20:35,340 --> 05:20:37,050
that I've seen heavily recommended.

7910
05:20:37,050 --> 05:20:38,250
So that's a great language.

7911
05:20:38,250 --> 05:20:39,870
- [Lex] How quickly would you go to Rails?

7912
05:20:39,870 --> 05:20:40,830
- It depends on what you wanna do.

7913
05:20:40,830 --> 05:20:42,510
If you wanna build web applications,

7914
05:20:42,510 --> 05:20:43,470
go to Rails right away.

7915
05:20:43,470 --> 05:20:45,120
Learn Ruby along with Rails,

7916
05:20:45,120 --> 05:20:47,341
because I think what really helps

7917
05:20:47,341 --> 05:20:49,710
power through learning programming

7918
05:20:49,710 --> 05:20:52,410
is to build programs that you want, right?

7919
05:20:52,410 --> 05:20:54,150
If you're just learning it in the abstract,

7920
05:20:54,150 --> 05:20:56,670
it's difficult to motivate yourself to actually do it.

7921
05:20:56,670 --> 05:20:58,260
Well, some people learn languages

7922
05:20:58,260 --> 05:20:59,940
just for the fun of them.

7923
05:20:59,940 --> 05:21:00,990
Most people do not.

7924
05:21:00,990 --> 05:21:01,980
Most people learn it

7925
05:21:01,980 --> 05:21:03,810
because they have a mission.

7926
05:21:03,810 --> 05:21:05,190
They wanna build a program.

7927
05:21:05,190 --> 05:21:06,240
They wanna become a programmer.

7928
05:21:06,240 --> 05:21:07,480
So you gotta use it for something real.

7929
05:21:07,480 --> 05:21:09,360
And I actually find that it's easier to learn programming

7930
05:21:09,360 --> 05:21:12,440
that way too because it drives your learning process.

7931
05:21:12,440 --> 05:21:15,030
You can't just learn the whole thing up front.

7932
05:21:15,030 --> 05:21:15,863
You can't just sit down

7933
05:21:15,863 --> 05:21:17,640
and read the language specification,

7934
05:21:17,640 --> 05:21:20,550
then go like, ooh, like Neo.

7935
05:21:20,550 --> 05:21:21,690
Now I know kung fu.

7936
05:21:21,690 --> 05:21:22,770
Now I know Ruby.

7937
05:21:22,770 --> 05:21:24,240
It doesn't download that way.

7938
05:21:24,240 --> 05:21:26,760
You actually have to type it out in anger

7939
05:21:26,760 --> 05:21:28,191
on a real program.

7940
05:21:28,191 --> 05:21:30,180
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.

7941
05:21:30,180 --> 05:21:31,200
- So I would start there.

7942
05:21:31,200 --> 05:21:33,540
But then number two, I probably would be JavaScript.

7943
05:21:33,540 --> 05:21:35,758
Because JavaScript just is the language

7944
05:21:35,758 --> 05:21:38,806
you need to know if you wanna work with the web.

7945
05:21:38,806 --> 05:21:40,773
And the web is the greatest application

7946
05:21:40,773 --> 05:21:42,330
platform of all time

7947
05:21:42,330 --> 05:21:44,253
if you're making business software,

7948
05:21:44,253 --> 05:21:47,130
collaboration software, all this kind of stuff.

7949
05:21:47,130 --> 05:21:48,180
If you're making video games,

7950
05:21:48,180 --> 05:21:50,940
you should probably go off and learn C++ or C

7951
05:21:50,940 --> 05:21:51,990
or something else like that.

7952
05:21:51,990 --> 05:21:54,645
But if you're in the realm of web applications,

7953
05:21:54,645 --> 05:21:56,310
you gotta learn JavaScript.

7954
05:21:56,310 --> 05:21:57,600
Regardless of what else you learn,

7955
05:21:57,600 --> 05:21:58,620
you gotta learn JavaScript.

7956
05:21:58,620 --> 05:22:00,720
- So if you're learning Ruby,

7957
05:22:00,720 --> 05:22:04,810
what does Ruby not have in terms of programming concepts

7958
05:22:06,300 --> 05:22:08,816
that you would need other languages for?

7959
05:22:08,816 --> 05:22:10,980
- I dunno if there's any concepts missing,

7960
05:22:10,980 --> 05:22:15,750
but it doesn't have the speed or the low level access

7961
05:22:15,750 --> 05:22:18,840
of memory manipulation that you would need to build

7962
05:22:18,840 --> 05:22:20,640
a 3D gaming engine, for example.

7963
05:22:20,640 --> 05:22:22,350
No one's gonna build that in Ruby.

7964
05:22:22,350 --> 05:22:24,750
You could build quite low level stuff

7965
05:22:24,750 --> 05:22:28,440
when it comes to web technologies in Ruby.

7966
05:22:28,440 --> 05:22:30,811
But at some point, you're gonna hit the limit

7967
05:22:30,811 --> 05:22:32,580
and you should use something else.

7968
05:22:32,580 --> 05:22:35,040
I'm not someone who prescribed just Ruby for everything.

7969
05:22:35,040 --> 05:22:37,549
Just once you reach the level of abstraction

7970
05:22:37,549 --> 05:22:41,970
that's involved with web applications, Ruby is superb.

7971
05:22:41,970 --> 05:22:45,973
But if you're writing, for example, HTTP proxy,

7972
05:22:45,973 --> 05:22:47,940
go, it's great for that.

7973
05:22:47,940 --> 05:22:49,890
We've written quite a few HTTP proxies

7974
05:22:49,890 --> 05:22:52,500
lately at the company for various reasons,

7975
05:22:52,500 --> 05:22:54,660
including our cloud exit and so forth.

7976
05:22:54,660 --> 05:22:57,120
And Kevin, one of the programs I'm working with,

7977
05:22:57,120 --> 05:22:58,350
he writes all of that in Go.

7978
05:22:58,350 --> 05:22:59,880
Go just have the primitives

7979
05:22:59,880 --> 05:23:01,410
and it has the pace and the speed

7980
05:23:01,410 --> 05:23:03,271
to do that really well.

7981
05:23:03,271 --> 05:23:05,340
I highly recommend it.

7982
05:23:05,340 --> 05:23:08,610
If you're writing an HTTP general proxy, do it in Go.

7983
05:23:08,610 --> 05:23:09,690
Great language for that.

7984
05:23:09,690 --> 05:23:11,760
Don't ride your business logic in Go.

7985
05:23:11,760 --> 05:23:14,319
I know people do, but I don't see the point in that.

7986
05:23:14,319 --> 05:23:15,960
- So what would you say the three,

7987
05:23:15,960 --> 05:23:19,560
so Go, Ruby plus Rails, JavaScript?

7988
05:23:19,560 --> 05:23:22,200
- Yeah, if you're interested in working with the web,

7989
05:23:22,200 --> 05:23:23,400
I'd pick those three.

7990
05:23:23,400 --> 05:23:25,093
Go, Ruby and JavaScript.

7991
05:23:25,093 --> 05:23:27,060
- Go, Ruby and JavaScript, okay.

7992
05:23:27,060 --> 05:23:28,140
Functional languages?

7993
05:23:28,140 --> 05:23:29,819
- Someone's talking about Ocaml.

7994
05:23:29,819 --> 05:23:32,373
- They are always going to show up.

7995
05:23:33,540 --> 05:23:37,897
It must be some kind of OCaml industrial complex

7996
05:23:37,897 --> 05:23:39,000
or something like this.

7997
05:23:39,000 --> 05:23:41,280
But they always say mention OCaml.

7998
05:23:41,280 --> 05:23:42,927
- I love that there are people

7999
05:23:42,927 --> 05:23:45,946
who love functional languages to that degree.

8000
05:23:45,946 --> 05:23:47,490
Those people are not me.

8001
05:23:47,490 --> 05:23:48,323
I don't care at all.

8002
05:23:48,323 --> 05:23:51,480
Like I care about functional principles

8003
05:23:51,480 --> 05:23:54,420
when they help me in these isolated cases

8004
05:23:54,420 --> 05:23:55,710
where that's just better than everything else.

8005
05:23:55,710 --> 05:23:59,310
But at heart, I'm an object oriented guy.

8006
05:23:59,310 --> 05:24:00,840
That's just how I think about programs.

8007
05:24:00,840 --> 05:24:02,580
That's how I like to think about programs.

8008
05:24:02,580 --> 05:24:05,730
That's how I carve up a big problem space

8009
05:24:05,730 --> 05:24:07,980
into a domain language.

8010
05:24:07,980 --> 05:24:10,590
Objects are my jam.

8011
05:24:10,590 --> 05:24:11,423
- Yeah, me too.

8012
05:24:11,423 --> 05:24:13,170
So I program a Lisp a bunch

8013
05:24:13,170 --> 05:24:16,980
for like AI applications for basic.

8014
05:24:16,980 --> 05:24:19,620
So Othello, chess engines, that kind of stuff.

8015
05:24:19,620 --> 05:24:22,920
And I did try OCaml just to force myself

8016
05:24:22,920 --> 05:24:25,500
to program just a very basic game of life.

8017
05:24:25,500 --> 05:24:26,644
A little simulation.

8018
05:24:26,644 --> 05:24:29,490
It's much, you know,

8019
05:24:29,490 --> 05:24:32,190
Lisp is just parentheses everywhere.

8020
05:24:32,190 --> 05:24:34,320
It's actually not readable at all.

8021
05:24:34,320 --> 05:24:36,489
- That's the problem I've had with Lisp.

8022
05:24:36,489 --> 05:24:39,630
- OCaml is very intuitive, very readable.

8023
05:24:39,630 --> 05:24:40,650
It's nice.

8024
05:24:40,650 --> 05:24:42,330
- I really should pick up a language

8025
05:24:42,330 --> 05:24:43,802
like that at some point.

8026
05:24:43,802 --> 05:24:44,892
I've been programming long enough

8027
05:24:44,892 --> 05:24:45,725
that it's a little embarrassing

8028
05:24:46,852 --> 05:24:48,915
that I haven't actually done anything real in anger

8029
05:24:48,915 --> 05:24:50,280
in a fully functionally programming language.

8030
05:24:50,280 --> 05:24:52,800
- Yeah, but like I have to figure out,

8031
05:24:52,800 --> 05:24:54,210
I'm sure there's an answer to this.

8032
05:24:54,210 --> 05:24:56,778
What can I do that would be useful for me

8033
05:24:56,778 --> 05:24:58,710
like that I actually wanna build?

8034
05:24:58,710 --> 05:25:00,390
- Yes, yes, that's my problem

8035
05:25:00,390 --> 05:25:02,595
- That a functional language is better suited for.

8036
05:25:02,595 --> 05:25:04,320
- That's right. - Because I really

8037
05:25:04,320 --> 05:25:05,600
wanna experience the language properly.

8038
05:25:05,600 --> 05:25:06,600
- [DHH] That's right.

8039
05:25:06,600 --> 05:25:08,520
- Yeah, 'cause I'm still, yeah.

8040
05:25:08,520 --> 05:25:11,580
At this point, I'm very object-oriented brained.

8041
05:25:11,580 --> 05:25:13,348
- Yes, and that's my problem too.

8042
05:25:13,348 --> 05:25:17,640
I don't care as much about these low level problems

8043
05:25:17,640 --> 05:25:18,720
in computer science.

8044
05:25:18,720 --> 05:25:19,740
I care about the high level.

8045
05:25:19,740 --> 05:25:21,600
I care about writing software.

8046
05:25:21,600 --> 05:25:25,235
I care about the abstraction layer

8047
05:25:25,235 --> 05:25:27,540
that really floats well

8048
05:25:27,540 --> 05:25:29,580
with web applications and business logic.

8049
05:25:29,580 --> 05:25:31,590
And I've come to accept that about myself.

8050
05:25:31,590 --> 05:25:34,320
Even though, as we talked about when I was a kid,

8051
05:25:34,320 --> 05:25:36,173
I really wanted to become a games programmer.

8052
05:25:36,173 --> 05:25:37,890
And then I saw what it took

8053
05:25:37,890 --> 05:25:40,020
to write a collision detection engine.

8054
05:25:40,020 --> 05:25:41,610
And I go like, yeah, that's not me at all.

8055
05:25:41,610 --> 05:25:45,102
I'm never gonna be into vector matrix manipulation

8056
05:25:45,102 --> 05:25:47,220
or any of that stuff.

8057
05:25:47,220 --> 05:25:49,186
It's way too much math

8058
05:25:49,186 --> 05:25:52,530
and I'm more of a writing person

8059
05:25:52,530 --> 05:25:54,190
than I'm of a math person.

8060
05:25:54,190 --> 05:25:56,928
- I mean, just in the way you were speaking today,

8061
05:25:56,928 --> 05:26:01,928
you have like a poetic literary approach to programming.

8062
05:26:03,030 --> 05:26:04,380
- Yes. - Yeah.

8063
05:26:04,380 --> 05:26:05,490
- It's interesting, that's actually exactly right.

8064
05:26:05,490 --> 05:26:09,811
So I did actually a keynote at RailsConf 10 years ago

8065
05:26:09,811 --> 05:26:12,510
where I call myself a software writer.

8066
05:26:12,510 --> 05:26:14,580
I mean, I'm not the first person to say that software writer

8067
05:26:14,580 --> 05:26:16,680
has been in the vernacular for a long time.

8068
05:26:16,680 --> 05:26:21,556
But the modern identity that most programmers adopt

8069
05:26:21,556 --> 05:26:25,200
when they're trying to be serious is software engineer.

8070
05:26:25,200 --> 05:26:26,340
And I reject that label.

8071
05:26:26,340 --> 05:26:27,690
I'm not an engineer.

8072
05:26:27,690 --> 05:26:30,422
Occasionally I dabble in some engineering,

8073
05:26:30,422 --> 05:26:33,690
but the vast majority of the time, I'm a software writer.

8074
05:26:33,690 --> 05:26:37,110
I write software for human consumption

8075
05:26:37,110 --> 05:26:38,853
and for my own delight.

8076
05:26:39,791 --> 05:26:41,940
I can get away with that

8077
05:26:41,940 --> 05:26:44,880
because I'm working in a high level language like Ruby,

8078
05:26:44,880 --> 05:26:46,980
working on collaboration software

8079
05:26:46,980 --> 05:26:49,020
and to-do lists and all the other stuff.

8080
05:26:49,020 --> 05:26:51,690
Again, if I was trying to apply my talents

8081
05:26:51,690 --> 05:26:54,470
to writing 3D game engines,

8082
05:26:54,470 --> 05:26:57,360
no, that's not the right mindset.

8083
05:26:57,360 --> 05:26:58,680
That's not the right identity.

8084
05:26:58,680 --> 05:27:02,430
But I find that the software engineering identity

8085
05:27:02,430 --> 05:27:04,145
flattens thing a little bit,

8086
05:27:04,145 --> 05:27:06,480
I'd like to think that we have software writers

8087
05:27:06,480 --> 05:27:08,910
and software mathematicians, for example.

8088
05:27:08,910 --> 05:27:10,493
And then those are actually richer

8089
05:27:10,493 --> 05:27:13,260
ways of describing the abstraction level

8090
05:27:13,260 --> 05:27:16,440
that you're working at than engineer.

8091
05:27:16,440 --> 05:27:19,110
- Yeah, and I think if AI

8092
05:27:19,110 --> 05:27:21,387
becomes more and more successful,

8093
05:27:21,387 --> 05:27:26,387
I think we'll need software writer skill more and more.

8094
05:27:26,802 --> 05:27:29,520
Because it feels like that's the realm

8095
05:27:29,520 --> 05:27:32,358
of which, 'cause it's not writer.

8096
05:27:32,358 --> 05:27:35,070
You're gonna have to do the software.

8097
05:27:35,070 --> 05:27:37,481
You're gonna have to be a computer person.

8098
05:27:37,481 --> 05:27:40,850
But there's a more... I don't know,

8099
05:27:40,850 --> 05:27:42,960
I just don't wanna romanticize it,

8100
05:27:42,960 --> 05:27:44,730
but it's more poetic, it's more literary.

8101
05:27:44,730 --> 05:27:48,240
It's more feels like writing a good blog post than...

8102
05:27:48,240 --> 05:27:50,212
- I actually wish that AI

8103
05:27:50,212 --> 05:27:52,770
had a bit higher standards for writing.

8104
05:27:52,770 --> 05:27:56,070
I find the fact that it accepts my sloppy,

8105
05:27:56,070 --> 05:27:58,710
incomplete sentences a little offensive.

8106
05:27:58,710 --> 05:28:00,980
I wish there was like a strict mode for AI

8107
05:28:00,980 --> 05:28:02,760
where it would snap my fingers.

8108
05:28:02,760 --> 05:28:05,790
It was just feeding it key words

8109
05:28:05,790 --> 05:28:07,266
and like speak proper,

8110
05:28:07,266 --> 05:28:10,236
do pronunciation, do punctuation,

8111
05:28:10,236 --> 05:28:12,165
because I love that.

8112
05:28:12,165 --> 05:28:16,155
I love crafting a just right sentence

8113
05:28:16,155 --> 05:28:19,020
that hasn't been boiled down,

8114
05:28:19,020 --> 05:28:22,800
that it has no meat on, it has no character in it.

8115
05:28:22,800 --> 05:28:24,120
It's succinct.

8116
05:28:24,120 --> 05:28:25,680
It's not overly flowery.

8117
05:28:25,680 --> 05:28:29,070
It is just right that writing phase,

8118
05:28:29,070 --> 05:28:32,160
to me, is just addictive.

8119
05:28:32,160 --> 05:28:35,027
And I find that when programming is the best,

8120
05:28:35,027 --> 05:28:37,530
it's almost equivalent exactly to that.

8121
05:28:37,530 --> 05:28:39,540
You also have to solve a problem.

8122
05:28:39,540 --> 05:28:41,130
You're not just communicating a solution.

8123
05:28:41,130 --> 05:28:42,420
You have to actually figure out

8124
05:28:42,420 --> 05:28:45,480
what are you trying to say, but even writing has that.

8125
05:28:45,480 --> 05:28:48,119
Half the time when I start writing a blog post,

8126
05:28:48,119 --> 05:28:50,606
I don't know exactly what arguments I'm gonna use.

8127
05:28:50,606 --> 05:28:52,931
They develop as part of the writing process.

8128
05:28:52,931 --> 05:28:56,130
And that's how writing software happens too.

8129
05:28:56,130 --> 05:28:57,773
You know roughly the kind of problem

8130
05:28:57,773 --> 05:28:58,890
you're trying to solve.

8131
05:28:58,890 --> 05:29:01,377
You don't know exactly how you're gonna solve it.

8132
05:29:01,377 --> 05:29:04,355
And as you start typing, the solution emerges.

8133
05:29:04,355 --> 05:29:06,960
- And actually, as far as I understand,

8134
05:29:06,960 --> 05:29:09,450
you and Jason are working on a new book.

8135
05:29:09,450 --> 05:29:11,790
It's in the early days of that kind of topic.

8136
05:29:11,790 --> 05:29:13,623
I think he said,

8137
05:29:13,623 --> 05:29:16,678
he tweeted that it's gonna be titled something like,

8138
05:29:16,678 --> 05:29:19,586
we don't know what we're doing upfront, something like that.

8139
05:29:19,586 --> 05:29:20,473
That kind of topic.

8140
05:29:20,473 --> 05:29:22,560
And you figure out along the way.

8141
05:29:22,560 --> 05:29:24,360
- That's a big part of it.

8142
05:29:24,360 --> 05:29:26,670
Trying to give more people the permission

8143
05:29:26,670 --> 05:29:29,370
to trust your own instincts and their own gut

8144
05:29:29,370 --> 05:29:33,023
and realizing that developing

8145
05:29:33,023 --> 05:29:35,658
that supercomputer in your stomach

8146
05:29:35,658 --> 05:29:38,250
is actually the work of a career.

8147
05:29:38,250 --> 05:29:41,992
And that you should not discard those feelings

8148
05:29:41,992 --> 05:29:46,992
in preference to over comp...

8149
05:29:47,220 --> 05:29:48,570
or not even complicated,

8150
05:29:48,570 --> 05:29:50,610
to analytics, to intellectualism.

8151
05:29:50,610 --> 05:29:53,430
Very often when we look at the big decisions

8152
05:29:53,430 --> 05:29:55,123
we've had to make, they've come from the gut

8153
05:29:55,123 --> 05:29:56,953
where you cannot fully articulate like,

8154
05:29:56,953 --> 05:29:59,033
why do I think this is the right thing?

8155
05:29:59,033 --> 05:30:01,399
Well, because I've been in this business for 20 years

8156
05:30:01,399 --> 05:30:02,367
and I've seen a bunch of things

8157
05:30:02,367 --> 05:30:04,440
and I've talked to a bunch of people,

8158
05:30:04,440 --> 05:30:07,353
and that is percolating into this being the right answer.

8159
05:30:08,670 --> 05:30:11,040
A lot of people are very skeptical about that

8160
05:30:11,040 --> 05:30:12,630
in business or unable to trust it

8161
05:30:12,630 --> 05:30:14,490
because it feels like they can't rationalize.

8162
05:30:14,490 --> 05:30:15,480
Why are we doing something?

8163
05:30:15,480 --> 05:30:17,458
Well, because I feel like it, damn it.

8164
05:30:17,458 --> 05:30:19,590
That's a great privilege

8165
05:30:19,590 --> 05:30:22,033
of being a bootstrapped independent founder

8166
05:30:22,033 --> 05:30:24,660
who don't owe their business to someone else

8167
05:30:24,660 --> 05:30:25,950
and doesn't have to produce a return.

8168
05:30:25,950 --> 05:30:28,770
Because I feel like a lot of the really creeps in

8169
05:30:28,770 --> 05:30:31,020
when you're trying to rationalize to other people

8170
05:30:31,020 --> 05:30:32,637
why you do the things you do

8171
05:30:32,637 --> 05:30:34,800
and why you take the decisions that you do.

8172
05:30:34,800 --> 05:30:37,620
If you don't have anyone to answer to,

8173
05:30:37,620 --> 05:30:39,750
you are free to follow your gut.

8174
05:30:39,750 --> 05:30:44,750
And that's hell of enjoyable way to work.

8175
05:30:44,836 --> 05:30:48,660
And it's also in very often the correct way to work.

8176
05:30:48,660 --> 05:30:51,210
Your gut knows a lot, like you can't articulate it,

8177
05:30:51,210 --> 05:30:53,800
but it's spot on more times than not.

8178
05:30:53,800 --> 05:30:56,455
- Yeah, having to make a plan can be a paralyzing thing.

8179
05:30:56,455 --> 05:30:58,350
I've often, I mean,

8180
05:30:58,350 --> 05:30:59,730
I suppose there's different kinds of brains.

8181
05:30:59,730 --> 05:31:00,563
And first of all,

8182
05:31:00,563 --> 05:31:04,203
I can't wait to read that book if it materializes.

8183
05:31:06,442 --> 05:31:10,174
I often feel like in the more interesting things

8184
05:31:10,174 --> 05:31:11,430
I do in my life,

8185
05:31:11,430 --> 05:31:13,959
I really don't know what I'm doing up upfront.

8186
05:31:13,959 --> 05:31:16,623
And I think there's a lot of people around me

8187
05:31:16,623 --> 05:31:19,500
that care for me that really want me

8188
05:31:19,500 --> 05:31:20,940
to know what I'm doing.

8189
05:31:20,940 --> 05:31:22,440
They're like, what's the plan?

8190
05:31:22,440 --> 05:31:24,299
Why are you doing this crazy thing?

8191
05:31:24,299 --> 05:31:26,844
And if I had to wait until I have a plan,

8192
05:31:26,844 --> 05:31:28,113
I'm not gonna do it.

8193
05:31:29,370 --> 05:31:31,680
They have different brains on this kind of stuff.

8194
05:31:31,680 --> 05:31:33,810
Some people really are planners

8195
05:31:33,810 --> 05:31:35,370
and it maybe energizes them.

8196
05:31:35,370 --> 05:31:39,540
I think most creative pursuits, most really interesting,

8197
05:31:39,540 --> 05:31:41,070
most novel pursuits are like,

8198
05:31:41,070 --> 05:31:44,070
you kind of have to just take the leap

8199
05:31:44,070 --> 05:31:45,960
and then just figure out as you go.

8200
05:31:45,960 --> 05:31:49,500
- My favorite essay in "Rework" is the last one,

8201
05:31:49,500 --> 05:31:53,120
and it's entitled, Inspiration is Perishable.

8202
05:31:53,120 --> 05:31:55,050
And I think that captures a lot of it,

8203
05:31:55,050 --> 05:31:59,310
that if you take the time to do a detailed plan,

8204
05:31:59,310 --> 05:32:01,200
you may very well have lost the inspiration

8205
05:32:01,200 --> 05:32:02,400
by the time you're done.

8206
05:32:02,400 --> 05:32:04,878
If you follow the inspiration in that moment

8207
05:32:04,878 --> 05:32:08,670
and trust your gut, trust your own competence,

8208
05:32:08,670 --> 05:32:10,624
that you will figure it out,

8209
05:32:10,624 --> 05:32:12,240
you're gonna get so much more back.

8210
05:32:12,240 --> 05:32:14,040
You're gonna go on the adventure

8211
05:32:14,040 --> 05:32:15,090
you otherwise wouldn't have.

8212
05:32:15,090 --> 05:32:18,000
Whether that's just a business decisions or life decision,

8213
05:32:18,000 --> 05:32:21,150
you have to seize that inspiration.

8214
05:32:21,150 --> 05:32:23,589
There's a great set of children's books

8215
05:32:23,589 --> 05:32:28,589
written by this Japanese author about chasing an idea

8216
05:32:28,860 --> 05:32:29,997
and trying to get a hold of it,

8217
05:32:29,997 --> 05:32:33,060
and it's beautifully illustrated as an idea

8218
05:32:33,060 --> 05:32:34,800
something that's floating around

8219
05:32:34,800 --> 05:32:38,040
as something you have to catch and latch onto.

8220
05:32:38,040 --> 05:32:39,840
That I really feel captures this notion

8221
05:32:39,840 --> 05:32:42,150
that inspiration is perishable, it'll disappear.

8222
05:32:42,150 --> 05:32:44,376
If you just put it back on the shelf and say like,

8223
05:32:44,376 --> 05:32:46,726
well, I gotta be diligent about this.

8224
05:32:46,726 --> 05:32:48,690
I gotta line up a plan.

8225
05:32:48,690 --> 05:32:52,413
You may run out and then there's no steam to keep going.

8226
05:32:53,841 --> 05:32:56,550
- I have to ask about open source.

8227
05:32:56,550 --> 05:33:00,549
What does it take to run a successful open source project?

8228
05:33:00,549 --> 05:33:02,463
You've spoken about that.

8229
05:33:02,463 --> 05:33:05,626
It's a misconception that open source is democratic.

8230
05:33:05,626 --> 05:33:09,210
It's actually meritocratic.

8231
05:33:09,210 --> 05:33:11,310
That's a beautiful way to put it.

8232
05:33:11,310 --> 05:33:14,550
So there's often is a kind of also a benevolent

8233
05:33:14,550 --> 05:33:17,730
dictator at the top often.

8234
05:33:17,730 --> 05:33:19,110
So can you just speak to that?

8235
05:33:19,110 --> 05:33:22,414
Having run successful open source projects yourself

8236
05:33:22,414 --> 05:33:25,652
and being a benevolent dictator yourself.

8237
05:33:25,652 --> 05:33:28,301
- Which is gonna be a bit of a biased

8238
05:33:28,301 --> 05:33:30,410
piece of evidence here, but I...

8239
05:33:31,384 --> 05:33:33,090
- But why monarchy is best. - It's great.

8240
05:33:33,090 --> 05:33:34,202
We should definitely have dictators

8241
05:33:34,202 --> 05:33:35,790
and they should control everything,

8242
05:33:35,790 --> 05:33:37,650
especially when the dictator is me.

8243
05:33:37,650 --> 05:33:40,320
Now, well I think I learned very early on

8244
05:33:40,320 --> 05:33:44,160
that a quick way to burn out in open source

8245
05:33:44,160 --> 05:33:47,520
is to treat it as a business,

8246
05:33:47,520 --> 05:33:49,740
as though your users are customers,

8247
05:33:49,740 --> 05:33:53,190
as though they have claims of legitimacy on your time

8248
05:33:53,190 --> 05:33:55,900
and your attention and your direction.

8249
05:33:55,900 --> 05:33:59,160
Because I faced this almost immediately

8250
05:33:59,160 --> 05:34:00,210
with Ruby on Rails.

8251
05:34:00,210 --> 05:34:01,860
As soon as it was released,

8252
05:34:01,860 --> 05:34:03,060
there were a million peoples

8253
05:34:03,060 --> 05:34:04,950
who had all sorts of opinions about

8254
05:34:04,950 --> 05:34:06,570
where I ought to take it.

8255
05:34:06,570 --> 05:34:09,330
And not just opinions, but actually demands.

8256
05:34:09,330 --> 05:34:12,390
Unless you implement an Oracle database adaptive,

8257
05:34:12,390 --> 05:34:14,403
this is always gonna be a toy.

8258
05:34:15,300 --> 05:34:18,470
It was actually more or less that exact demand

8259
05:34:18,470 --> 05:34:21,030
that prompted me to have a slide at one

8260
05:34:21,030 --> 05:34:25,504
of the early Rails conferences that just said, fuck you.

8261
05:34:25,504 --> 05:34:27,200
- [Lex] Yeah, I saw that.

8262
05:34:27,200 --> 05:34:29,112
- I'm not gonna do what you tell me to.

8263
05:34:29,112 --> 05:34:31,591
I'm here as a bringer of gift.

8264
05:34:31,591 --> 05:34:36,591
I am sharing code that I wrote on my own time,

8265
05:34:36,622 --> 05:34:38,488
on my own volition.

8266
05:34:38,488 --> 05:34:41,010
And you don't have to say thank you.

8267
05:34:41,010 --> 05:34:42,750
I mean it'd be nice if you did.

8268
05:34:42,750 --> 05:34:45,030
You can take the code and do whatever you want with it.

8269
05:34:45,030 --> 05:34:46,900
You can contribute back if you want,

8270
05:34:46,900 --> 05:34:48,870
but you can't tell me what to do

8271
05:34:48,870 --> 05:34:50,866
or where to go or how to act.

8272
05:34:50,866 --> 05:34:53,130
I'm not a vendor.

8273
05:34:53,130 --> 05:34:55,380
This is a fundamental misconception

8274
05:34:55,380 --> 05:34:57,960
that users of open source occasionally step into,

8275
05:34:57,960 --> 05:35:01,650
because they're used to buying software from companies

8276
05:35:01,650 --> 05:35:04,311
who really care about their business.

8277
05:35:04,311 --> 05:35:06,750
I care about people using my software.

8278
05:35:06,750 --> 05:35:08,340
I think it's great,

8279
05:35:08,340 --> 05:35:11,202
but we don't have a transactional relationship.

8280
05:35:11,202 --> 05:35:13,134
I don't get something back

8281
05:35:13,134 --> 05:35:16,680
when you tell me what to do except grief.

8282
05:35:16,680 --> 05:35:18,615
And I don't want it, so you can keep it.

8283
05:35:18,615 --> 05:35:20,880
So my open source philosophy

8284
05:35:20,880 --> 05:35:25,306
from the start has been, I gotta do this primarily for me.

8285
05:35:25,306 --> 05:35:28,563
I love when other people find use in my open source.

8286
05:35:28,563 --> 05:35:30,570
It's not my primary motivation.

8287
05:35:30,570 --> 05:35:32,520
I'm not primarily doing it for other people.

8288
05:35:32,520 --> 05:35:35,730
I'm primarily doing it for me and my own objectives

8289
05:35:35,730 --> 05:35:38,970
because as Adam Smith said,

8290
05:35:38,970 --> 05:35:41,700
it's not for the benevolence of the butcher

8291
05:35:41,700 --> 05:35:43,950
that we expect our daily meat.

8292
05:35:43,950 --> 05:35:46,230
It's for his self-interest.

8293
05:35:46,230 --> 05:35:49,320
And I actually find that to be a beautiful thought

8294
05:35:49,320 --> 05:35:52,440
that our comments increase in value

8295
05:35:52,440 --> 05:35:54,720
when we all pursue our self-interest.

8296
05:35:54,720 --> 05:35:57,120
Certainly in the realm of open source.

8297
05:35:57,120 --> 05:35:58,980
This is also why I reject this notion

8298
05:35:58,980 --> 05:36:01,470
that open source is in some sort of crisis.

8299
05:36:01,470 --> 05:36:04,677
That there's a funding crisis that we have to spend more.

8300
05:36:04,677 --> 05:36:05,640
No, we don't.

8301
05:36:05,640 --> 05:36:07,230
Open source has never been doing better.

8302
05:36:07,230 --> 05:36:09,510
Open source has never controlled more domains

8303
05:36:09,510 --> 05:36:11,786
in software than it has right now.

8304
05:36:11,786 --> 05:36:14,280
There is no crisis.

8305
05:36:14,280 --> 05:36:17,790
There's a misconception from some people making open source

8306
05:36:17,790 --> 05:36:19,950
and from a lot of people using open source.

8307
05:36:19,950 --> 05:36:23,520
That open source is primarily like commercial software.

8308
05:36:23,520 --> 05:36:24,600
Something you buy

8309
05:36:24,600 --> 05:36:28,410
and something where you can then make demands as a customer.

8310
05:36:28,410 --> 05:36:30,120
And that the customer is always right.

8311
05:36:30,120 --> 05:36:31,590
Customer is not always right.

8312
05:36:31,590 --> 05:36:35,490
Not even in business, but certainly not in open source.

8313
05:36:35,490 --> 05:36:36,480
In open source,

8314
05:36:36,480 --> 05:36:40,020
the customer, as it is, is a receiver of gifts.

8315
05:36:40,020 --> 05:36:42,540
We are having a gift exchange.

8316
05:36:42,540 --> 05:36:44,370
I show up and give you my code.

8317
05:36:44,370 --> 05:36:46,290
If you like it, you can use it.

8318
05:36:46,290 --> 05:36:48,826
And if you have some code that fits in

8319
05:36:48,826 --> 05:36:50,700
with where I'm going with this,

8320
05:36:50,700 --> 05:36:52,557
I would love to get those gifts back.

8321
05:36:52,557 --> 05:36:54,810
And we can keep trading like that.

8322
05:36:54,810 --> 05:36:55,710
I give you more gifts.

8323
05:36:55,710 --> 05:36:57,300
You give me some of your gifts.

8324
05:36:57,300 --> 05:36:58,860
Together, we pool all the gifts

8325
05:36:58,860 --> 05:37:00,780
such that someone showing up brand new,

8326
05:37:00,780 --> 05:37:02,875
just get a mountain of gifts.

8327
05:37:02,875 --> 05:37:04,830
This is the magic thing of open source

8328
05:37:04,830 --> 05:37:07,830
is it increases the total sum value

8329
05:37:07,830 --> 05:37:08,820
of what's in the common

8330
05:37:08,820 --> 05:37:10,590
when we all pursue our own self-interest.

8331
05:37:10,590 --> 05:37:13,620
So I'm building things for Rails that I need.

8332
05:37:13,620 --> 05:37:14,453
And you know what?

8333
05:37:14,453 --> 05:37:15,720
You want me to do that.

8334
05:37:15,720 --> 05:37:17,250
You do not want me to build things

8335
05:37:17,250 --> 05:37:19,374
that I don't need on behalf of other people,

8336
05:37:19,374 --> 05:37:20,962
'cause I'll do a crap job.

8337
05:37:20,962 --> 05:37:22,864
I build much better software

8338
05:37:22,864 --> 05:37:26,888
when I can evaluate the quality of that software

8339
05:37:26,888 --> 05:37:28,421
by my own use.

8340
05:37:28,421 --> 05:37:31,230
I need this feature.

8341
05:37:31,230 --> 05:37:32,910
I'm gonna build a good version of that feature

8342
05:37:32,910 --> 05:37:34,770
and I'm gonna build just enough just for me.

8343
05:37:34,770 --> 05:37:36,390
So I'm not gonna bloat it.

8344
05:37:36,390 --> 05:37:38,427
I'm not trying to attract the customer here.

8345
05:37:38,427 --> 05:37:40,770
I'm not trying to see some angle.

8346
05:37:40,770 --> 05:37:42,641
I'm just building what I need.

8347
05:37:42,641 --> 05:37:46,800
And if you go into open source with that mentality

8348
05:37:46,800 --> 05:37:50,148
that you're building for you and everything else is a bonus,

8349
05:37:50,148 --> 05:37:53,175
I think you have all the ingredients to go to distance.

8350
05:37:53,175 --> 05:37:56,370
I think the people who burn out in open source

8351
05:37:56,370 --> 05:37:59,600
is when they go in thinking, "I'm making all these gifts.

8352
05:37:59,600 --> 05:38:01,350
I don't really need them myself,

8353
05:38:01,350 --> 05:38:02,760
but I'm like hoping someone else does

8354
05:38:02,760 --> 05:38:05,100
and maybe they'll also give me some money."

8355
05:38:05,100 --> 05:38:06,870
That's a losing proposition.

8356
05:38:06,870 --> 05:38:08,550
It never basically works.

8357
05:38:08,550 --> 05:38:10,380
If you want money for your software,

8358
05:38:10,380 --> 05:38:11,580
you should just sell it.

8359
05:38:11,580 --> 05:38:14,970
We have a perfectly fine model of commercial software

8360
05:38:14,970 --> 05:38:16,440
that people can make that kind

8361
05:38:16,440 --> 05:38:17,490
and then they can sell it.

8362
05:38:17,490 --> 05:38:21,540
But I find a lot of confusion,

8363
05:38:21,540 --> 05:38:23,130
let's just call it that politely,

8364
05:38:23,130 --> 05:38:24,330
in open source contributors

8365
05:38:24,330 --> 05:38:26,190
who want to have their cake and eat it too.

8366
05:38:26,190 --> 05:38:29,250
They like the mode of working with open source.

8367
05:38:29,250 --> 05:38:31,620
They maybe even like the status that comes from open source,

8368
05:38:31,620 --> 05:38:33,450
but they also would like to earn a living

8369
05:38:33,450 --> 05:38:35,430
for making that open source.

8370
05:38:35,430 --> 05:38:37,500
And therefore, they occasionally end up

8371
05:38:37,500 --> 05:38:40,170
with the kind of grievances

8372
05:38:40,170 --> 05:38:43,650
that someone who feels underappreciated at work will develop

8373
05:38:43,650 --> 05:38:45,592
when others aren't doing enough to recognize

8374
05:38:45,592 --> 05:38:47,002
their great gifts.

8375
05:38:47,002 --> 05:38:49,140
- And then they might walk away.

8376
05:38:49,140 --> 05:38:52,782
I wish I had more insight into their mind state

8377
05:38:52,782 --> 05:38:57,782
of the individual people that are running these projects,

8378
05:38:57,990 --> 05:39:00,690
like if they're feeling sad or they need more money

8379
05:39:00,690 --> 05:39:04,440
or they're like, it's just such a dark box.

8380
05:39:04,440 --> 05:39:05,370
- It can be.

8381
05:39:05,370 --> 05:39:07,110
- I mean of course there's some communication,

8382
05:39:07,110 --> 05:39:10,110
but I just sadly see too often

8383
05:39:10,110 --> 05:39:11,670
they just kind of walk away.

8384
05:39:11,670 --> 05:39:14,160
- Right, and I think that's actually

8385
05:39:14,160 --> 05:39:16,050
also part of the beauty of open source.

8386
05:39:16,050 --> 05:39:17,730
- Is walking away. - You are not obligated

8387
05:39:17,730 --> 05:39:19,950
to do this code forever.

8388
05:39:19,950 --> 05:39:22,758
You're obligated to do this for as long as you wanna do it.

8389
05:39:22,758 --> 05:39:24,480
That's basically your own obligation.

8390
05:39:24,480 --> 05:39:26,750
- But there is a, I know, okay...

8391
05:39:26,750 --> 05:39:28,590
So you might criticize some pushback.

8392
05:39:28,590 --> 05:39:30,750
You did write a blog post on forever,

8393
05:39:30,750 --> 05:39:33,303
until the end of the internet with ta-da list.

8394
05:39:33,303 --> 05:39:36,041
There is a beautiful aspect

8395
05:39:36,041 --> 05:39:38,463
and you found a good balance there.

8396
05:39:39,505 --> 05:39:41,895
But I don't know, you're bringing so much joy to people

8397
05:39:41,895 --> 05:39:44,084
with this thing you created.

8398
05:39:44,084 --> 05:39:47,010
It's not an obligation, but there's a real beauty

8399
05:39:47,010 --> 05:39:48,537
to taking care of this thing you've created.

8400
05:39:48,537 --> 05:39:50,640
There is and not forgetting.

8401
05:39:50,640 --> 05:39:52,890
I think, what I think

8402
05:39:52,890 --> 05:39:55,167
what the open source creator is not seeing enough

8403
05:39:55,167 --> 05:39:56,463
and I mean there's like,

8404
05:39:59,040 --> 05:40:01,631
how many lives you're making better.

8405
05:40:01,631 --> 05:40:03,330
There's certain pieces of software

8406
05:40:03,330 --> 05:40:05,193
that I just quietly use a lot.

8407
05:40:06,360 --> 05:40:08,383
And like they bring my life joy

8408
05:40:08,383 --> 05:40:11,670
and I wish I could communicate that well.

8409
05:40:11,670 --> 05:40:13,950
There's ways to donate, but it's inefficient.

8410
05:40:13,950 --> 05:40:15,765
It's usually hard to donate.

8411
05:40:15,765 --> 05:40:17,070
- It is.

8412
05:40:17,070 --> 05:40:20,201
There's some ways for some people that made it easier.

8413
05:40:20,201 --> 05:40:22,039
GitHub donations is one way of doing it.

8414
05:40:22,039 --> 05:40:23,490
I donate to a few people

8415
05:40:23,490 --> 05:40:26,340
even though I don't love the paradigm.

8416
05:40:26,340 --> 05:40:28,440
I also accept that we can have multiple paradigms.

8417
05:40:28,440 --> 05:40:30,120
I accept that I can do open source

8418
05:40:30,120 --> 05:40:31,320
for one set of motivations

8419
05:40:31,320 --> 05:40:32,940
and other people can do

8420
05:40:32,940 --> 05:40:34,290
open source for other motivations.

8421
05:40:34,290 --> 05:40:36,660
We don't all have to do it the same way.

8422
05:40:36,660 --> 05:40:39,090
But I do want to counter the misconception

8423
05:40:39,090 --> 05:40:41,130
that open source is somehow high in a crisis

8424
05:40:41,130 --> 05:40:43,980
unless we all start paying for open source.

8425
05:40:43,980 --> 05:40:45,450
That model already exists.

8426
05:40:45,450 --> 05:40:46,590
It's commercial software.

8427
05:40:46,590 --> 05:40:49,290
It works very well and plenty of great companies

8428
05:40:49,290 --> 05:40:50,970
have been built off the back of it.

8429
05:40:50,970 --> 05:40:52,830
And the expectations are very clear.

8430
05:40:52,830 --> 05:40:55,920
I pay you this amount and I get this software.

8431
05:40:55,920 --> 05:40:58,170
Open source, once you start mixing money into it,

8432
05:40:58,170 --> 05:41:00,030
gets real muddy real fast.

8433
05:41:00,030 --> 05:41:03,870
And a lot of it's just from those misaligned expectations.

8434
05:41:03,870 --> 05:41:06,990
That if you feel like you're starving artists

8435
05:41:06,990 --> 05:41:08,430
as an open source developer

8436
05:41:08,430 --> 05:41:11,730
and you are owed X amount of money

8437
05:41:11,730 --> 05:41:15,630
because your software is popular, you're delusional

8438
05:41:15,630 --> 05:41:17,580
and you need to knock that off.

8439
05:41:17,580 --> 05:41:18,900
Just get back on track

8440
05:41:18,900 --> 05:41:21,382
where you realize that you're putting gifts into the world.

8441
05:41:21,382 --> 05:41:23,070
And if you get something back

8442
05:41:23,070 --> 05:41:24,780
in terms of monetary compensation,

8443
05:41:24,780 --> 05:41:25,975
okay, that's a bonus.

8444
05:41:25,975 --> 05:41:27,990
But if you need that money back

8445
05:41:27,990 --> 05:41:29,910
in terms of monetary compensation,

8446
05:41:29,910 --> 05:41:30,743
you just charge for software

8447
05:41:30,743 --> 05:41:32,670
or go work for a software company

8448
05:41:32,670 --> 05:41:34,590
that will employ you to do open source.

8449
05:41:34,590 --> 05:41:36,128
There's tons of that.

8450
05:41:36,128 --> 05:41:37,861
That is probably actually the primary mode

8451
05:41:37,861 --> 05:41:39,020
that open source software

8452
05:41:39,020 --> 05:41:41,130
is being developed in the world today.

8453
05:41:41,130 --> 05:41:44,040
Commercial companies making open source

8454
05:41:44,040 --> 05:41:46,410
that they need themselves and then contributing it back.

8455
05:41:46,410 --> 05:41:48,300
- So I'm glad you sort of like

8456
05:41:48,300 --> 05:41:49,906
drew some hard lines here.

8457
05:41:49,906 --> 05:41:51,900
It is a good moment to bring up

8458
05:41:51,900 --> 05:41:56,900
what I think is the, maybe one of the greatest

8459
05:41:57,300 --> 05:42:00,859
open source projects ever, WordPress.

8460
05:42:00,859 --> 05:42:04,790
And you spoke up in October 24

8461
05:42:07,380 --> 05:42:10,020
about some of the stuff that's been going on

8462
05:42:10,020 --> 05:42:12,330
with WordPress's founder Matt Mullenweg

8463
05:42:12,330 --> 05:42:16,740
in a blog post open source royalty and mad kings.

8464
05:42:16,740 --> 05:42:17,850
It's a really good blog post

8465
05:42:17,850 --> 05:42:21,720
on sort of just the idea of Benevolent Dictators For Life,

8466
05:42:21,720 --> 05:42:23,775
this model for open source projects.

8467
05:42:23,775 --> 05:42:25,950
And then the basic implication

8468
05:42:25,950 --> 05:42:29,910
was that Matt as the BDFL of WordPress

8469
05:42:29,910 --> 05:42:34,503
has lost his way a bit with his battle with WP Engine.

8470
05:42:35,820 --> 05:42:38,790
So I should also say that I really love WordPress.

8471
05:42:38,790 --> 05:42:39,690
It brings me joy.

8472
05:42:39,690 --> 05:42:41,910
I think it's a really...

8473
05:42:41,910 --> 05:42:45,480
it's a beacon of what open source could be.

8474
05:42:45,480 --> 05:42:49,140
I think it's made the internet better.

8475
05:42:49,140 --> 05:42:52,590
It allowed a lot of people to create wonderful websites.

8476
05:42:52,590 --> 05:42:55,020
And I also think, now you might disagree with this,

8477
05:42:55,020 --> 05:42:56,853
but from everything I've seen,

8478
05:42:58,410 --> 05:43:02,373
WP Engine just gives me bad vibes.

8479
05:43:03,303 --> 05:43:06,930
I think they're not the good guy in this.

8480
05:43:06,930 --> 05:43:08,160
I don't like it.

8481
05:43:08,160 --> 05:43:10,188
I understand the frustration.

8482
05:43:10,188 --> 05:43:11,360
I understand all of it,

8483
05:43:11,360 --> 05:43:14,790
but I don't think that excuses the behavior.

8484
05:43:14,790 --> 05:43:17,190
There is a bit of, see this kind of counter

8485
05:43:17,190 --> 05:43:19,230
to a little bit what you said,

8486
05:43:19,230 --> 05:43:23,370
which is when you have a open source project of that size,

8487
05:43:23,370 --> 05:43:25,870
there is a bit of a, like when you're the king

8488
05:43:28,260 --> 05:43:32,100
for a project of a kingdom that large,

8489
05:43:32,100 --> 05:43:33,750
there's a bit of responsibility.

8490
05:43:33,750 --> 05:43:38,455
Anyway, could you speak to your, maybe to your empathy

8491
05:43:38,455 --> 05:43:41,980
of Matt and to your criticism

8492
05:43:44,652 --> 05:43:47,460
and maybe paint a path

8493
05:43:47,460 --> 05:43:52,460
of how he and WordPress can be winning again?

8494
05:43:52,710 --> 05:43:55,800
- First echo what you said about

8495
05:43:55,800 --> 05:43:58,353
what a wonderful thing it is that WordPress exists.

8496
05:43:58,353 --> 05:44:00,600
That there are not many projects

8497
05:44:00,600 --> 05:44:03,000
in the open source world or in the world at large

8498
05:44:03,000 --> 05:44:05,940
that has had as big of an impact on the internet

8499
05:44:05,940 --> 05:44:07,440
as WordPress has.

8500
05:44:07,440 --> 05:44:11,760
He deserves a ton of accolades for that work.

8501
05:44:11,760 --> 05:44:15,480
So that was my engagement, essentially my premise.

8502
05:44:15,480 --> 05:44:16,313
Do you know what?

8503
05:44:16,313 --> 05:44:18,060
I had tremendous respect

8504
05:44:18,060 --> 05:44:20,280
for what Matt has built with WordPress.

8505
05:44:20,280 --> 05:44:23,315
What that entire ecosystem has built around itself.

8506
05:44:23,315 --> 05:44:25,337
It's a true marvel.

8507
05:44:25,337 --> 05:44:27,660
But there's some principles

8508
05:44:27,660 --> 05:44:30,450
that are larger than my personal sympathies

8509
05:44:30,450 --> 05:44:32,220
to the characters involved.

8510
05:44:32,220 --> 05:44:33,300
I agree.

8511
05:44:33,300 --> 05:44:36,240
The Silver Lake private equity company

8512
05:44:36,240 --> 05:44:40,698
that's involved with WP Engine is not my natural ally.

8513
05:44:40,698 --> 05:44:45,210
I'm not the natural ally of private equity

8514
05:44:45,210 --> 05:44:48,420
doing some game with VP Engine.

8515
05:44:48,420 --> 05:44:51,540
That's not my interest in the case.

8516
05:44:51,540 --> 05:44:55,680
My interest is essentially a set of principles.

8517
05:44:55,680 --> 05:44:57,930
And the principles are if you release

8518
05:44:57,930 --> 05:44:59,562
something as open source,

8519
05:44:59,562 --> 05:45:03,030
people are free to use it as they see fit.

8520
05:45:03,030 --> 05:45:07,410
And they're free to donate code or resources

8521
05:45:07,410 --> 05:45:10,680
or money back to the community as they see fit.

8522
05:45:10,680 --> 05:45:15,000
You may disagree about whether they've done enough,

8523
05:45:15,000 --> 05:45:18,576
whether they should do more, but you can't show up

8524
05:45:18,576 --> 05:45:20,647
after you've given the gift

8525
05:45:20,647 --> 05:45:23,550
of free software to the world

8526
05:45:23,550 --> 05:45:25,530
and then say, now that you've used that gift,

8527
05:45:25,530 --> 05:45:28,110
you actually owe me a huge slide of your business

8528
05:45:28,110 --> 05:45:29,850
because you got too successful

8529
05:45:29,850 --> 05:45:33,090
using the thing I gave you for free.

8530
05:45:33,090 --> 05:45:35,190
You don't get to take a gift back.

8531
05:45:35,190 --> 05:45:37,830
That's why we have open source licenses.

8532
05:45:37,830 --> 05:45:41,280
They stipulate exactly what the obligations are

8533
05:45:41,280 --> 05:45:43,230
on both sides of the equation.

8534
05:45:43,230 --> 05:45:45,367
The uses of open source don't get to demand

8535
05:45:45,367 --> 05:45:48,450
what the makers of open source do and how they act.

8536
05:45:48,450 --> 05:45:50,460
And the makers of open source

8537
05:45:50,460 --> 05:45:53,873
don't get to suddenly show up with a ransom note

8538
05:45:53,873 --> 05:45:55,140
to the users and say,

8539
05:45:55,140 --> 05:45:57,420
actually you owe me for all sorts of use.

8540
05:45:57,420 --> 05:46:02,420
I'm 100% allergic to that kind of interaction.

8541
05:46:02,580 --> 05:46:06,524
And I think Matt, unfortunately, for whatever reason,

8542
05:46:06,524 --> 05:46:09,850
got so wrapped up in what he was owed

8543
05:46:11,734 --> 05:46:15,391
that he failed to realize what he was destroying.

8544
05:46:15,391 --> 05:46:19,140
WordPress and Automatic already makes a ton of money.

8545
05:46:19,140 --> 05:46:20,940
This is part of the wonder of WordPress.

8546
05:46:20,940 --> 05:46:22,680
This is a project

8547
05:46:22,680 --> 05:46:25,536
that generates hundreds of millions of dollars,

8548
05:46:25,536 --> 05:46:29,253
and Matt didn't feel like he was getting enough of that.

8549
05:46:30,870 --> 05:46:32,640
That's not a good argument, bro.

8550
05:46:32,640 --> 05:46:34,730
You can't just violate the spirit

8551
05:46:34,730 --> 05:46:37,356
and the letter of these open source licensees

8552
05:46:37,356 --> 05:46:40,020
and just start showing up with demand letters

8553
05:46:40,020 --> 05:46:44,040
even to characters that are not particularly sympathetic.

8554
05:46:44,040 --> 05:46:46,560
This goes to the root of my interpretation

8555
05:46:46,560 --> 05:46:48,707
of open source in general.

8556
05:46:48,707 --> 05:46:53,190
The GPL is a particular license

8557
05:46:53,190 --> 05:46:55,050
that actually demands code

8558
05:46:55,050 --> 05:46:58,160
from people who use it under certain circumstances.

8559
05:46:58,160 --> 05:46:59,953
I've never liked the GPL.

8560
05:46:59,953 --> 05:47:01,680
I don't want your shitty code

8561
05:47:01,680 --> 05:47:03,900
if you don't wanna give it to me.

8562
05:47:03,900 --> 05:47:05,610
What am I gonna do with that?

8563
05:47:05,610 --> 05:47:08,220
Some code dump that youve...

8564
05:47:08,220 --> 05:47:11,490
I'm not on board with that part of Stallman's vision at all.

8565
05:47:11,490 --> 05:47:13,020
I love the MIT license.

8566
05:47:13,020 --> 05:47:14,293
To me that is the perfect license

8567
05:47:14,293 --> 05:47:17,340
because it is mercifully short.

8568
05:47:17,340 --> 05:47:19,980
I think it's two paragraphs, three paragraphs.

8569
05:47:19,980 --> 05:47:24,430
Really short, and it basically says, here's some software.

8570
05:47:24,430 --> 05:47:26,470
It comes with no warranty.

8571
05:47:26,470 --> 05:47:28,050
You can't sue me.

8572
05:47:28,050 --> 05:47:29,460
You can't demand anything,

8573
05:47:29,460 --> 05:47:31,890
but you can do whatever the hell you want with it.

8574
05:47:31,890 --> 05:47:33,150
Have a nice life.

8575
05:47:33,150 --> 05:47:37,332
That's a perfect open source interaction in my opinion.

8576
05:47:37,332 --> 05:47:40,320
And that license needs to be upheld.

8577
05:47:40,320 --> 05:47:42,510
These licenses, in general, even the GPL,

8578
05:47:42,510 --> 05:47:43,530
even if I don't like it,

8579
05:47:43,530 --> 05:47:45,480
we have to abide by them.

8580
05:47:45,480 --> 05:47:47,610
Because if we just set aside those licensees,

8581
05:47:47,610 --> 05:47:49,830
when we in a moment's notice

8582
05:47:49,830 --> 05:47:51,630
feel like something's slightly unfair,

8583
05:47:51,630 --> 05:47:52,620
we've lost everything.

8584
05:47:52,620 --> 05:47:54,750
We've lost the entire framework

8585
05:47:54,750 --> 05:47:56,820
that allowed open source to prosper

8586
05:47:56,820 --> 05:47:58,670
and allowed open source

8587
05:47:58,670 --> 05:48:01,410
to become such an integral part of commerce too.

8588
05:48:01,410 --> 05:48:04,020
I mean, back when open source was initially

8589
05:48:04,020 --> 05:48:05,430
finding its feet,

8590
05:48:05,430 --> 05:48:07,800
it was at war with commercial software.

8591
05:48:07,800 --> 05:48:10,140
Stallman is at war with commercial software

8592
05:48:10,140 --> 05:48:11,460
and always has been.

8593
05:48:11,460 --> 05:48:14,070
Bill Gates was in return at war

8594
05:48:14,070 --> 05:48:16,718
with open source for the longest time.

8595
05:48:16,718 --> 05:48:18,540
The open source licensees

8596
05:48:18,540 --> 05:48:20,220
and the clarity that they provide

8597
05:48:20,220 --> 05:48:21,930
allowed us to end that war.

8598
05:48:21,930 --> 05:48:25,020
Today, commercial software and open source software

8599
05:48:25,020 --> 05:48:26,490
can peacefully coexist.

8600
05:48:26,490 --> 05:48:27,750
I make commercial software.

8601
05:48:27,750 --> 05:48:29,730
I sell Basecamp, I sell HEY,

8602
05:48:29,730 --> 05:48:31,500
and then I also make a bunch of open source software

8603
05:48:31,500 --> 05:48:33,426
that I give away for free as gifts.

8604
05:48:33,426 --> 05:48:35,808
That can't happen

8605
05:48:35,808 --> 05:48:38,610
if we start violating these contracts.

8606
05:48:38,610 --> 05:48:40,597
No commercial company is gonna go,

8607
05:48:40,597 --> 05:48:42,300
"Let me base my next project

8608
05:48:42,300 --> 05:48:43,470
off this piece of open source.

8609
05:48:43,470 --> 05:48:45,300
If I'm also running the liability

8610
05:48:45,300 --> 05:48:50,160
that some mad maker is gonna show up seven years in

8611
05:48:50,160 --> 05:48:52,437
and demand, I give them $50 million."

8612
05:48:53,280 --> 05:48:55,740
That's not an environment conducive

8613
05:48:55,740 --> 05:48:58,170
to commerce collaboration or anything else.

8614
05:48:58,170 --> 05:49:00,060
And it's just basically wrong.

8615
05:49:00,060 --> 05:49:02,370
I think there's one analysis that's all about

8616
05:49:02,370 --> 05:49:04,350
kind of the practical outcomes of this,

8617
05:49:04,350 --> 05:49:05,400
which I think are bad.

8618
05:49:05,400 --> 05:49:09,720
There's also some an argument that's simply about ethics.

8619
05:49:09,720 --> 05:49:11,130
This is not right.

8620
05:49:11,130 --> 05:49:13,563
You can't just show up afterwards and demand something.

8621
05:49:13,563 --> 05:49:15,900
This is not too dissimilar in my opinion,

8622
05:49:15,900 --> 05:49:18,300
to the whole Apple thing we talked about earlier.

8623
05:49:18,300 --> 05:49:20,640
Apple just showing up and feeling like they're entitled

8624
05:49:20,640 --> 05:49:22,530
to 30% of everyone's business.

8625
05:49:22,530 --> 05:49:25,574
No, that's not right.

8626
05:49:25,574 --> 05:49:27,034
That's not fair.

8627
05:49:27,034 --> 05:49:30,250
So I think Matt unfortunately

8628
05:49:31,110 --> 05:49:34,260
kind of steered himself blind

8629
05:49:34,260 --> 05:49:36,120
on the indignity

8630
05:49:36,120 --> 05:49:37,830
he thought was being perpetrated

8631
05:49:37,830 --> 05:49:40,470
against him because there was all this money being made

8632
05:49:40,470 --> 05:49:43,020
by VP Engine making a good product

8633
05:49:43,020 --> 05:49:46,353
and not giving quite enough back in Matt's opinion,

8634
05:49:48,240 --> 05:49:49,073
tough cookie.

8635
05:49:49,073 --> 05:49:51,247
- I think there, maybe I'm reading too much into it,

8636
05:49:51,247 --> 05:49:53,520
but there might be some personal stuff too,

8637
05:49:53,520 --> 05:49:56,460
which they weren't only not giving enough,

8638
05:49:56,460 --> 05:50:00,280
but probably implicitly promising that they will give

8639
05:50:01,333 --> 05:50:05,160
and then taking advantage of him in that way in his mind,

8640
05:50:05,160 --> 05:50:07,309
just like interpersonal interaction.

8641
05:50:07,309 --> 05:50:11,104
And then you get like interpersonally frustrated,

8642
05:50:11,104 --> 05:50:13,530
that forget like the bigger picture ethics of it.

8643
05:50:13,530 --> 05:50:16,230
It's like when a guy keeps saying, you know,

8644
05:50:16,230 --> 05:50:17,899
promising you'll do something.

8645
05:50:17,899 --> 05:50:20,790
And then you realize you wake up one day

8646
05:50:20,790 --> 05:50:22,800
like a year or two later.

8647
05:50:22,800 --> 05:50:26,130
Wait a minute, I was being lied to this whole time

8648
05:50:26,130 --> 05:50:28,597
and that I don't even know if it's about money.

8649
05:50:28,597 --> 05:50:30,270
- I'd get mad too.

8650
05:50:30,270 --> 05:50:33,150
It's totally fine to get mad when people disappoint you.

8651
05:50:33,150 --> 05:50:37,290
That's not justification for upending decades

8652
05:50:37,290 --> 05:50:40,020
of open source licensees

8653
05:50:40,020 --> 05:50:42,429
and the essential de facto case law

8654
05:50:42,429 --> 05:50:43,860
we've established around it.

8655
05:50:43,860 --> 05:50:47,051
This is why I chose to even weigh in on this

8656
05:50:47,051 --> 05:50:48,870
because I like WordPress.

8657
05:50:48,870 --> 05:50:49,860
I don't use WordPress.

8658
05:50:49,860 --> 05:50:51,030
I'm not a part of that community.

8659
05:50:51,030 --> 05:50:54,540
I don't actually have a dog in this fight.

8660
05:50:54,540 --> 05:50:59,010
I'm biased if anything towards Matt just as a fellow BDFL.

8661
05:50:59,010 --> 05:51:01,590
I would like to see him do well with this.

8662
05:51:01,590 --> 05:51:03,480
But I also think there's some principles at stake here

8663
05:51:03,480 --> 05:51:05,880
that ring much louder.

8664
05:51:05,880 --> 05:51:09,930
I don't want Rails to suddenly be tainted

8665
05:51:09,930 --> 05:51:11,310
by the fact that it's open source

8666
05:51:11,310 --> 05:51:13,290
and whether companies can rely on it

8667
05:51:13,290 --> 05:51:14,340
and build businesses on it.

8668
05:51:14,340 --> 05:51:17,070
Because wait, maybe one day I'm gonna turn Matt

8669
05:51:17,070 --> 05:51:18,270
and I'm gonna turn Matt King

8670
05:51:18,270 --> 05:51:20,700
and I'm gonna show up with a demand ransom letter.

8671
05:51:20,700 --> 05:51:21,817
No, screw that.

8672
05:51:21,817 --> 05:51:24,990
We have way more to protect here.

8673
05:51:24,990 --> 05:51:28,140
There's way more at stake than your personal beef

8674
05:51:28,140 --> 05:51:30,266
with someone or your perceived grievance

8675
05:51:30,266 --> 05:51:31,650
over what you're owed.

8676
05:51:31,650 --> 05:51:32,580
- What would you recommend?

8677
05:51:32,580 --> 05:51:34,740
What do you think he should do, can do

8678
05:51:34,740 --> 05:51:37,323
to walk it back to heal?

8679
05:51:40,290 --> 05:51:43,530
- Decide, this is the curious thing.

8680
05:51:43,530 --> 05:51:45,540
He could decide to give this up.

8681
05:51:45,540 --> 05:51:47,130
That's very, very difficult

8682
05:51:47,130 --> 05:51:49,470
for driven, ambitious people to do.

8683
05:51:49,470 --> 05:51:50,670
To accept that they're wrong

8684
05:51:50,670 --> 05:51:52,950
and to give up and lay down their sword.

8685
05:51:52,950 --> 05:51:57,950
So I had a hope earlier on in this that that was possible.

8686
05:51:57,960 --> 05:51:59,190
I haven't seen any evidence

8687
05:51:59,190 --> 05:52:00,747
that Matt is interested in that

8688
05:52:00,747 --> 05:52:02,700
and I find that deeply regretful,

8689
05:52:02,700 --> 05:52:04,800
but that's his prerogative.

8690
05:52:04,800 --> 05:52:06,090
I continue to speak out

8691
05:52:06,090 --> 05:52:07,950
when he's violating the spirit

8692
05:52:07,950 --> 05:52:09,870
and ethics of open source,

8693
05:52:09,870 --> 05:52:13,030
but I wish he would just accept

8694
05:52:14,018 --> 05:52:15,780
that this was a really bad idea.

8695
05:52:15,780 --> 05:52:17,850
He made a bad bet and I thought,

8696
05:52:17,850 --> 05:52:20,220
I think he thought he'd just get away with it.

8697
05:52:20,220 --> 05:52:23,843
That they'd just pay up and that he could put pressure.

8698
05:52:23,843 --> 05:52:26,100
I mean, I know that temptation.

8699
05:52:26,100 --> 05:52:27,480
When you sit as the head

8700
05:52:27,480 --> 05:52:29,492
of a very important project,

8701
05:52:29,492 --> 05:52:33,840
you know that that comes with a great degree of power

8702
05:52:33,840 --> 05:52:37,950
and you really need a great degree of discipline

8703
05:52:37,950 --> 05:52:40,800
to reign that in and not exercise that power

8704
05:52:40,800 --> 05:52:42,540
at every step where you feel aggrieved.

8705
05:52:42,540 --> 05:52:45,236
I've felt aggrieved a million times over

8706
05:52:45,236 --> 05:52:48,930
in the 20 plus years of Ruby on Rails.

8707
05:52:48,930 --> 05:52:51,848
I've really tried very hard not to let those...

8708
05:52:51,848 --> 05:52:55,570
sometimes petty, sometimes substantial grievances over time

8709
05:52:57,150 --> 05:53:00,420
seep in to the foundation of the ecosystem

8710
05:53:00,420 --> 05:53:03,210
and risk ruining everything.

8711
05:53:03,210 --> 05:53:04,890
- As the king of the Rails kingdom,

8712
05:53:04,890 --> 05:53:07,380
has the power gotten to your head over the years?

8713
05:53:07,380 --> 05:53:08,353
- I'm sure it has.

8714
05:53:08,353 --> 05:53:10,020
I mean, who wouldn't?

8715
05:53:10,020 --> 05:53:13,290
- Do you pace around in your chamber angry?

8716
05:53:13,290 --> 05:53:15,183
- I do occasionally.

8717
05:53:16,287 --> 05:53:19,290
And I do marvel at both what's been built,

8718
05:53:19,290 --> 05:53:20,310
what's been possible.

8719
05:53:20,310 --> 05:53:21,780
Over a million applications

8720
05:53:21,780 --> 05:53:22,980
have been made with Ruby on Rails

8721
05:53:22,980 --> 05:53:24,720
by one estimate that I've seen,

8722
05:53:24,720 --> 05:53:27,062
businesses like Shopify and GitHub

8723
05:53:27,062 --> 05:53:29,790
and a million others have been built

8724
05:53:29,790 --> 05:53:31,410
on top of something that I started.

8725
05:53:31,410 --> 05:53:33,642
That's very gratifying.

8726
05:53:33,642 --> 05:53:36,689
But you really have to be careful not

8727
05:53:36,689 --> 05:53:39,330
to smell your own exhaust too much.

8728
05:53:39,330 --> 05:53:41,490
And you have to be just as careful

8729
05:53:41,490 --> 05:53:43,487
not to listen too much to the haters

8730
05:53:43,487 --> 05:53:47,460
and not to listen too much to the super fans either

8731
05:53:47,460 --> 05:53:51,019
that you assess the value

8732
05:53:51,019 --> 05:53:55,362
and the sort of principles of what you're working towards

8733
05:53:55,362 --> 05:53:58,740
on its own merits, on your own scoreboard.

8734
05:53:58,740 --> 05:54:02,889
I try to block that out and then just go,

8735
05:54:02,889 --> 05:54:06,518
well I'm working on Rails because I love to write Ruby.

8736
05:54:06,518 --> 05:54:11,010
I love to use Ruby to make web applications.

8737
05:54:11,010 --> 05:54:12,240
That's my north star.

8738
05:54:12,240 --> 05:54:15,069
And I'll continue to do that and I'll continue to share

8739
05:54:15,069 --> 05:54:16,860
all of the open source gifts

8740
05:54:16,860 --> 05:54:19,893
that I uncover along the ways,

8741
05:54:21,030 --> 05:54:21,863
and that's it.

8742
05:54:21,863 --> 05:54:23,100
That's enough too.

8743
05:54:23,100 --> 05:54:25,260
I don't have to get all of it out of it.

8744
05:54:25,260 --> 05:54:28,470
This is sometimes just as with the guy

8745
05:54:28,470 --> 05:54:30,940
who thought I'd given up on being Jira or something,

8746
05:54:30,940 --> 05:54:32,716
instead of doing Basecamp,

8747
05:54:32,716 --> 05:54:35,400
there are people over the years who've asked like,

8748
05:54:35,400 --> 05:54:36,960
why didn't you charge for Rails?

8749
05:54:36,960 --> 05:54:38,520
Like, don't you know how much money

8750
05:54:38,520 --> 05:54:40,170
have been made off Rails?

8751
05:54:40,170 --> 05:54:42,030
If we just look at something like Shopify,

8752
05:54:42,030 --> 05:54:44,070
it's worth billions of dollars.

8753
05:54:44,070 --> 05:54:45,000
I'm not a billionaire

8754
05:54:45,000 --> 05:54:46,800
and so freaking what?

8755
05:54:46,800 --> 05:54:49,020
I got more than enough.

8756
05:54:49,020 --> 05:54:50,970
I got plenty of my share.

8757
05:54:50,970 --> 05:54:55,571
I will say though, I'm also introspective enough

8758
05:54:55,571 --> 05:54:58,230
to realize that if it hadn't panned out as well

8759
05:54:58,230 --> 05:55:00,360
as it did for me on my own business,

8760
05:55:00,360 --> 05:55:02,340
maybe I would've been more tempted.

8761
05:55:02,340 --> 05:55:04,320
Maybe if you see other people build

8762
05:55:04,320 --> 05:55:07,437
huge successful companies off the back of your work

8763
05:55:07,437 --> 05:55:10,667
and you really don't have a pot to pissed in,

8764
05:55:10,667 --> 05:55:15,480
you might be tempted to get a little upset about that.

8765
05:55:15,480 --> 05:55:17,430
I've seen that in the Rails world as well,

8766
05:55:17,430 --> 05:55:19,350
where there are people who contributed

8767
05:55:19,350 --> 05:55:20,940
substantial bodies of work

8768
05:55:20,940 --> 05:55:23,310
and then got really miffed

8769
05:55:23,310 --> 05:55:25,680
when they didn't feel like they got enough back.

8770
05:55:25,680 --> 05:55:27,720
I was fortunate enough that the business

8771
05:55:27,720 --> 05:55:29,730
that Jason and I built with Ruby on Rails

8772
05:55:29,730 --> 05:55:31,110
was as successful as it was.

8773
05:55:31,110 --> 05:55:33,510
And I made the money I needed to make

8774
05:55:33,510 --> 05:55:36,160
that I didn't need to chase the rest of it.

8775
05:55:36,160 --> 05:55:39,420
- But we should also just make explicit

8776
05:55:39,420 --> 05:55:41,530
that many people in your position

8777
05:55:45,330 --> 05:55:46,710
chase the money.

8778
05:55:46,710 --> 05:55:48,630
It's not that difficult to chase.

8779
05:55:48,630 --> 05:55:49,920
Basically you turned away money.

8780
05:55:49,920 --> 05:55:53,670
You made a lot of decisions that just turned away money.

8781
05:55:53,670 --> 05:55:57,726
- Maybe, I also think of this example with Matt.

8782
05:55:57,726 --> 05:56:00,180
He probably thought there was easy money

8783
05:56:00,180 --> 05:56:01,207
for the taking.

8784
05:56:01,207 --> 05:56:02,430
And it wasn't so easy, was it?

8785
05:56:02,430 --> 05:56:04,957
It looked like low hanging dollar bills

8786
05:56:04,957 --> 05:56:07,530
and they turned out to be some really sour grapes.

8787
05:56:07,530 --> 05:56:08,363
It turned out

8788
05:56:09,212 --> 05:56:12,810
he probably destroyed vast sums of money

8789
05:56:12,810 --> 05:56:16,320
by undermining the whole WordPress trust

8790
05:56:16,320 --> 05:56:17,670
and the ecosystem

8791
05:56:17,670 --> 05:56:20,460
and putting question marks in the heads of folks

8792
05:56:20,460 --> 05:56:22,080
who would choose to use WordPress

8793
05:56:22,080 --> 05:56:24,210
or something else going forward.

8794
05:56:24,210 --> 05:56:26,116
So I often think when people think like,

8795
05:56:26,116 --> 05:56:28,170
you left money on the table.

8796
05:56:28,170 --> 05:56:29,250
First of all, so what?

8797
05:56:29,250 --> 05:56:30,480
I don't have to have all the money.

8798
05:56:30,480 --> 05:56:31,413
But second of all,

8799
05:56:32,279 --> 05:56:33,147
maybe the money wasn't on the table at all.

8800
05:56:33,147 --> 05:56:35,370
- And maybe the cost.

8801
05:56:35,370 --> 05:56:36,300
Even if you got the money,

8802
05:56:36,300 --> 05:56:37,753
maybe the cost in other ways,

8803
05:56:37,753 --> 05:56:39,451
like we've talked about,

8804
05:56:39,451 --> 05:56:41,133
would outweigh all the money

8805
05:56:41,133 --> 05:56:42,840
that you could have possibly gotten.

8806
05:56:42,840 --> 05:56:45,510
Meaning like I think you said that the thing

8807
05:56:45,510 --> 05:56:50,190
that makes you happy is flow and tranquility.

8808
05:56:50,190 --> 05:56:51,120
Those two things.

8809
05:56:51,120 --> 05:56:53,490
Beautifully, really beautifully put.

8810
05:56:53,490 --> 05:56:57,750
And it, you know, gaining money might assign

8811
05:56:57,750 --> 05:57:00,717
to you responsibility of running a larger thing

8812
05:57:00,717 --> 05:57:04,050
that takes away the flow

8813
05:57:04,050 --> 05:57:07,680
that you gain from being... fundamentally for you

8814
05:57:07,680 --> 05:57:09,687
what flow means is programming.

8815
05:57:09,687 --> 05:57:11,730
And then tranquility is like,

8816
05:57:11,730 --> 05:57:14,460
I think you also have a beautiful post

8817
05:57:14,460 --> 05:57:17,212
of like Nirvana is an empty schedule.

8818
05:57:17,212 --> 05:57:19,615
- When I look at a upcoming week

8819
05:57:19,615 --> 05:57:21,683
and I see that I have no scheduled meetings at all,

8820
05:57:21,683 --> 05:57:23,250
which is quite common,

8821
05:57:23,250 --> 05:57:26,730
or maybe I just have one thing for one hour on one day.

8822
05:57:26,730 --> 05:57:28,170
I think to myself, do you know what?

8823
05:57:28,170 --> 05:57:30,420
This could very easily have been very different.

8824
05:57:30,420 --> 05:57:32,670
We could have been running a company of hundreds of people

8825
05:57:32,670 --> 05:57:35,310
or thousands of people and my entire calendar

8826
05:57:35,310 --> 05:57:38,820
would've been packed solid with little Tetris blocks

8827
05:57:38,820 --> 05:57:42,270
of other people's demands on my attention and time,

8828
05:57:42,270 --> 05:57:45,000
and I would've been miserable as fuck.

8829
05:57:45,000 --> 05:57:47,269
And I look at that and go like that,

8830
05:57:47,269 --> 05:57:50,601
what more can I ask for?

8831
05:57:50,601 --> 05:57:54,750
Which is a really nice state of being I'd actually say.

8832
05:57:54,750 --> 05:57:56,340
I didn't have this always.

8833
05:57:56,340 --> 05:57:59,850
I did have early on in my career some sense of like,

8834
05:57:59,850 --> 05:58:01,529
I need a little more.

8835
05:58:01,529 --> 05:58:02,880
A little more security.

8836
05:58:02,880 --> 05:58:06,150
And I remember this really interesting study

8837
05:58:06,150 --> 05:58:09,060
where a bunch of researchers asked people

8838
05:58:09,060 --> 05:58:10,500
who would made certain amounts of money,

8839
05:58:10,500 --> 05:58:13,720
how much money would it take for you to feel secure?

8840
05:58:13,720 --> 05:58:16,440
They'd ask people who had a million dollars network?

8841
05:58:16,440 --> 05:58:18,060
How much money do you need?

8842
05:58:18,060 --> 05:58:19,507
Probably need 2 million.

8843
05:58:19,507 --> 05:58:20,853
2 million then I'd be good.

8844
05:58:20,853 --> 05:58:23,130
Then they'd ask people with a net worth of 5 million,

8845
05:58:23,130 --> 05:58:24,300
how much do you need?

8846
05:58:24,300 --> 05:58:26,123
Ah, 10, I need 10.

8847
05:58:26,123 --> 05:58:27,690
Ask people with 10 million,

8848
05:58:27,690 --> 05:58:28,980
what do you need? 20.

8849
05:58:28,980 --> 05:58:30,330
Every single time people

8850
05:58:30,330 --> 05:58:31,620
would need double of what they did.

8851
05:58:31,620 --> 05:58:33,900
I did that for a couple of doublings

8852
05:58:33,900 --> 05:58:35,130
until I realized, you know what?

8853
05:58:35,130 --> 05:58:36,030
This is silly.

8854
05:58:36,030 --> 05:58:37,800
I am already where I wished

8855
05:58:37,800 --> 05:58:40,650
I would be and a million times over.

8856
05:58:40,650 --> 05:58:43,740
So what less is there to pursue?

8857
05:58:43,740 --> 05:58:45,273
Now that doesn't mean

8858
05:58:45,273 --> 05:58:47,040
that if more money is coming my way,

8859
05:58:47,040 --> 05:58:47,970
I'm gonna say no to it.

8860
05:58:47,970 --> 05:58:48,960
Of course not.

8861
05:58:48,960 --> 05:58:53,010
But it does mean that I'm free to set other things higher.

8862
05:58:53,010 --> 05:58:54,926
And I also do think you realize,

8863
05:58:54,926 --> 05:58:57,180
as Jim Carrey would say,

8864
05:58:57,180 --> 05:58:59,790
I wish everyone would get all the money they wished for

8865
05:58:59,790 --> 05:59:01,410
and they'd realize it wasn't the answer.

8866
05:59:01,410 --> 05:59:06,410
That money solves a whole host of problems and anxieties,

8867
05:59:06,570 --> 05:59:08,760
and then it creates a bunch of new ones.

8868
05:59:08,760 --> 05:59:10,491
And then it also doesn't touch

8869
05:59:10,491 --> 05:59:14,061
a huge swath of the human experience at all.

8870
05:59:14,061 --> 05:59:16,442
The world is full of miserable,

8871
05:59:16,442 --> 05:59:20,193
anxious, hurt, rich people.

8872
05:59:20,193 --> 05:59:23,067
It's also full of miserable, anxious, poor people

8873
05:59:23,067 --> 05:59:25,470
and I'd rather be a miserable, anxious, rich person

8874
05:59:25,470 --> 05:59:26,730
than a poor person.

8875
05:59:26,730 --> 05:59:29,820
But it isn't this magic wand that make everything go away.

8876
05:59:29,820 --> 05:59:33,570
And that's again, one of those insights

8877
05:59:33,570 --> 05:59:34,403
just like having children

8878
05:59:34,403 --> 05:59:36,420
that you cannot communicate in words.

8879
05:59:36,420 --> 05:59:38,910
I've never been able to persuade a person

8880
05:59:38,910 --> 05:59:41,640
who's not wealthy that wealth wasn't gonna solve

8881
05:59:41,640 --> 05:59:42,930
all their problems.

8882
05:59:42,930 --> 05:59:44,580
- One quote you've returned to often

8883
05:59:44,580 --> 05:59:47,174
that I enjoy a lot is the Coco Chanel quote

8884
05:59:47,174 --> 05:59:51,060
of the best things in life are free.

8885
05:59:51,060 --> 05:59:54,586
And the second best things are very, very expensive.

8886
05:59:54,586 --> 05:59:58,950
And I guess the task is to focus

8887
05:59:58,950 --> 06:00:02,496
on surrounding yourself with the best things in life

8888
06:00:02,496 --> 06:00:04,710
like family and all of this

8889
06:00:04,710 --> 06:00:06,960
and not caring about the other stuff.

8890
06:00:06,960 --> 06:00:09,240
- I would easily say you can care about the other stuff.

8891
06:00:09,240 --> 06:00:11,871
Just know the order of priority.

8892
06:00:11,871 --> 06:00:16,871
If you are blessed with a partner that you love,

8893
06:00:17,490 --> 06:00:19,920
some children that you adore,

8894
06:00:19,920 --> 06:00:22,650
you've already won the greatest prize

8895
06:00:22,650 --> 06:00:26,910
that most humans are able to achieve.

8896
06:00:26,910 --> 06:00:28,650
Most humans in this world,

8897
06:00:28,650 --> 06:00:32,010
if they are of marital age and they have children,

8898
06:00:32,010 --> 06:00:33,693
if you ask them what's the most important thing,

8899
06:00:33,693 --> 06:00:35,250
they would all say that.

8900
06:00:35,250 --> 06:00:36,210
They would all say that.

8901
06:00:36,210 --> 06:00:38,284
No matter whether they're rich or poor.

8902
06:00:38,284 --> 06:00:40,380
It's easy to lose sight of that

8903
06:00:40,380 --> 06:00:42,407
when you're chasing the second best things.

8904
06:00:42,407 --> 06:00:43,440
Because do you know what?

8905
06:00:43,440 --> 06:00:44,590
They're also very nice.

8906
06:00:45,484 --> 06:00:47,850
I really like that Pagani Zonda.

8907
06:00:47,850 --> 06:00:49,380
It was a very expensive car

8908
06:00:49,380 --> 06:00:51,960
and I would have no chance of acquiring it

8909
06:00:51,960 --> 06:00:56,190
if I hadn't become rather successful in business.

8910
06:00:56,190 --> 06:00:57,900
So I don't wanna dismiss it either.

8911
06:00:57,900 --> 06:01:00,985
It's great fun to have money.

8912
06:01:00,985 --> 06:01:05,985
It's just not as fun for quite as long

8913
06:01:06,360 --> 06:01:08,850
or as deep as you think it is.

8914
06:01:08,850 --> 06:01:12,120
And these other things, having an occupation

8915
06:01:12,120 --> 06:01:13,800
and a pursuit that you enjoy,

8916
06:01:13,800 --> 06:01:18,800
being able to carry burdens with a stiff up of a lip

8917
06:01:18,990 --> 06:01:23,990
and with, again, a sense of meaning is incredible.

8918
06:01:24,090 --> 06:01:27,960
To have family, to have friends, to have hobbies,

8919
06:01:27,960 --> 06:01:30,560
to have all these things that are actually available

8920
06:01:31,500 --> 06:01:35,580
to most people around the world, that's winning.

8921
06:01:35,580 --> 06:01:38,880
And it doesn't mean you have to discount your ambitions,

8922
06:01:38,880 --> 06:01:41,120
it doesn't mean you can't reach for more,

8923
06:01:41,120 --> 06:01:44,250
but it does mean it's pretty dumb

8924
06:01:44,250 --> 06:01:45,970
if you don't realize that

8925
06:01:47,730 --> 06:01:49,620
it's not gonna complete you

8926
06:01:49,620 --> 06:01:54,210
in some hocus-pocus woo sense to make more.

8927
06:01:54,210 --> 06:01:55,503
It really isn't.

8928
06:01:56,520 --> 06:01:59,010
- What gives you hope about the future

8929
06:01:59,010 --> 06:02:01,590
of this whole thing we have going on here?

8930
06:02:01,590 --> 06:02:02,853
Human civilization.

8931
06:02:04,650 --> 06:02:09,650
- I find it easier to be optimistic than pessimistic,

8932
06:02:10,740 --> 06:02:12,870
because I don't know either way.

8933
06:02:12,870 --> 06:02:14,580
So if I get to choose,

8934
06:02:14,580 --> 06:02:17,130
why not just choose to believe it's gonna pan out?

8935
06:02:17,130 --> 06:02:20,970
Like we suffer more in our imagination

8936
06:02:20,970 --> 06:02:22,020
than we do in reality.

8937
06:02:22,020 --> 06:02:24,420
That's one of the quotes out of stoicism.

8938
06:02:24,420 --> 06:02:28,560
And I also think we have a tendency,

8939
06:02:28,560 --> 06:02:30,330
a lot of humans have a tendency

8940
06:02:30,330 --> 06:02:33,180
to be pessimistic in advance

8941
06:02:33,180 --> 06:02:35,804
for things they don't know how it's gonna pan out.

8942
06:02:35,804 --> 06:02:37,380
Climate change, for example,

8943
06:02:37,380 --> 06:02:39,690
is making a lot of people very anxious

8944
06:02:39,690 --> 06:02:41,550
and very pessimistic about the future.

8945
06:02:41,550 --> 06:02:42,968
You know nothing.

8946
06:02:42,968 --> 06:02:44,910
40 years ago we thought the problem

8947
06:02:44,910 --> 06:02:47,340
was that the planet was gonna be too cool.

8948
06:02:47,340 --> 06:02:49,590
I happen to believe that it's probably correct

8949
06:02:49,590 --> 06:02:51,570
that the planet is getting too hot

8950
06:02:51,570 --> 06:02:54,120
and that CO2 has something to do with it.

8951
06:02:54,120 --> 06:02:57,480
Whether we have the right measures to fix it in time,

8952
06:02:57,480 --> 06:02:59,472
if that's even possible or not,

8953
06:02:59,472 --> 06:03:02,040
is completely up in the air

8954
06:03:02,040 --> 06:03:03,300
and we don't know.

8955
06:03:03,300 --> 06:03:05,580
If you convince yourself with such certainty

8956
06:03:05,580 --> 06:03:08,280
that the world is gonna turn to shit, it is.

8957
06:03:08,280 --> 06:03:11,610
Right up here, in your head today.

8958
06:03:11,610 --> 06:03:14,460
Climate change might wipe out this entire species

8959
06:03:14,460 --> 06:03:18,333
in 200 years is not next year.

8960
06:03:18,333 --> 06:03:20,728
It's not 10 years from now.

8961
06:03:20,728 --> 06:03:22,204
Life might become more unpleasant

8962
06:03:22,204 --> 06:03:24,253
and there might be more negative effects, and so on.

8963
06:03:24,253 --> 06:03:27,510
Yes, okay, but then deal with that hardship

8964
06:03:27,510 --> 06:03:28,890
when it arrives.

8965
06:03:28,890 --> 06:03:30,660
Don't take that in advance.

8966
06:03:30,660 --> 06:03:32,550
How are you helping earth

8967
06:03:32,550 --> 06:03:36,376
by just walking around being depressed?

8968
06:03:36,376 --> 06:03:39,330
- I think our whole conversation today

8969
06:03:39,330 --> 06:03:40,800
is also an indication.

8970
06:03:40,800 --> 06:03:42,960
It's just two humans talking.

8971
06:03:42,960 --> 06:03:44,700
There's billions of us,

8972
06:03:44,700 --> 06:03:45,930
and there is something about us

8973
06:03:45,930 --> 06:03:49,647
that wants to solve problems and build cool stuff.

8974
06:03:49,647 --> 06:03:51,780
And so we're gonna build our way out

8975
06:03:51,780 --> 06:03:54,001
of whatever we get ourselves into.

8976
06:03:54,001 --> 06:03:55,710
This is what humans do.

8977
06:03:55,710 --> 06:03:57,529
We create problems for ourselves

8978
06:03:57,529 --> 06:03:59,400
and come up,

8979
06:03:59,400 --> 06:04:01,200
figure out how to build rocket ships

8980
06:04:03,162 --> 06:04:04,470
to get out of those problems.

8981
06:04:04,470 --> 06:04:05,670
And sometimes the rocket ships

8982
06:04:05,670 --> 06:04:07,710
create other problems like nuclear warheads

8983
06:04:07,710 --> 06:04:09,663
and then, I'm sure,

8984
06:04:11,010 --> 06:04:13,656
I hope, figure out ways how to avoid those problems.

8985
06:04:13,656 --> 06:04:15,390
And then there'll be nanobots

8986
06:04:15,390 --> 06:04:17,280
and then the aliens will come

8987
06:04:17,280 --> 06:04:18,540
and there'll be a massive war

8988
06:04:18,540 --> 06:04:20,610
between the nanobots and the aliens,

8989
06:04:20,610 --> 06:04:23,313
and that will bring all of us humans together.

8990
06:04:24,506 --> 06:04:25,876
- The funny thing,

8991
06:04:25,876 --> 06:04:28,137
just to pick up one of the points you mentioned,

8992
06:04:28,137 --> 06:04:30,090
the atom bomb, for example.

8993
06:04:30,090 --> 06:04:31,380
When that was first invented,

8994
06:04:31,380 --> 06:04:32,340
a lot of people thought

8995
06:04:32,340 --> 06:04:34,743
we have essentially ended life on earth, right?

8996
06:04:35,718 --> 06:04:38,490
Or maybe we prevented World War III

8997
06:04:38,490 --> 06:04:41,160
from happening in the past 80 years

8998
06:04:41,160 --> 06:04:45,000
because assured mutual annihilation

8999
06:04:45,000 --> 06:04:47,580
kept the superpowers from attacking each other

9000
06:04:47,580 --> 06:04:48,960
at least head on

9001
06:04:48,960 --> 06:04:52,170
and kept their fighting to proxy wars.

9002
06:04:52,170 --> 06:04:53,003
You know what?

9003
06:04:53,003 --> 06:04:54,120
Proxy wars are not great,

9004
06:04:54,120 --> 06:04:56,520
but they're probably better than World War III

9005
06:04:56,520 --> 06:04:57,960
with nuclear weapons.

9006
06:04:57,960 --> 06:05:00,780
So it's quite difficult in the moment

9007
06:05:00,780 --> 06:05:04,377
to tell what's actually benefit and what's not.

9008
06:05:04,377 --> 06:05:06,480
And I think we should be a bit more humble.

9009
06:05:06,480 --> 06:05:08,850
I've certainly become more humble over time

9010
06:05:08,850 --> 06:05:12,390
of thinking I know which way it's gonna turn.

9011
06:05:12,390 --> 06:05:14,970
I think the pandemic was a huge moment

9012
06:05:14,970 --> 06:05:15,803
for a lot of people

9013
06:05:15,803 --> 06:05:18,150
where there was so much certainty

9014
06:05:18,150 --> 06:05:20,610
about whether this intervention worked

9015
06:05:20,610 --> 06:05:22,396
or that intervention didn't work.

9016
06:05:22,396 --> 06:05:25,650
And most people were wrong.

9017
06:05:25,650 --> 06:05:27,840
Certainly a lot of very smart people,

9018
06:05:27,840 --> 06:05:31,830
very qualified people got that just utterly

9019
06:05:31,830 --> 06:05:34,950
and catastrophe finely wrong.

9020
06:05:34,950 --> 06:05:37,350
So just a little intellectual humility,

9021
06:05:37,350 --> 06:05:39,360
I think back upon that and go like, you know what?

9022
06:05:39,360 --> 06:05:42,130
I'm not a PhD in virology

9023
06:05:44,550 --> 06:05:46,530
and I don't claim that like I somehow saw

9024
06:05:46,530 --> 06:05:47,700
how it always gonna play out.

9025
06:05:47,700 --> 06:05:49,293
But the people who were really experts in it,

9026
06:05:49,293 --> 06:05:50,640
they got a bunch of it wrong.

9027
06:05:50,640 --> 06:05:52,320
Nobody knows anything.

9028
06:05:52,320 --> 06:05:54,900
I keep reminding myself of that every day.

9029
06:05:54,900 --> 06:05:56,040
No one knows anything.

9030
06:05:56,040 --> 06:05:59,790
We can't predict the economy a month out.

9031
06:05:59,790 --> 06:06:01,500
We can't predict world affairs a month.

9032
06:06:01,500 --> 06:06:03,030
The world is just too complicated.

9033
06:06:03,030 --> 06:06:05,130
- Yeah, when I watched the Netflix

9034
06:06:05,130 --> 06:06:06,963
documentary "Chimp Empire"

9035
06:06:07,800 --> 06:06:11,340
and you know, there's a hierarchy of chimps,

9036
06:06:11,340 --> 06:06:14,850
all of that looks eerily similar to us humans.

9037
06:06:14,850 --> 06:06:16,804
We're recent descendants.

9038
06:06:16,804 --> 06:06:19,380
So these experts,

9039
06:06:19,380 --> 06:06:23,580
some of the chimps are got a PhD, others don't.

9040
06:06:23,580 --> 06:06:25,680
Others are really muscular.

9041
06:06:25,680 --> 06:06:27,600
Others are like beta male kind.

9042
06:06:27,600 --> 06:06:29,550
They're sucking up to the alpha.

9043
06:06:29,550 --> 06:06:31,410
There's a lot of interesting dynamics going on

9044
06:06:31,410 --> 06:06:34,770
that really maps cleanly to the geopolitics of the day.

9045
06:06:34,770 --> 06:06:35,970
They don't have nuclear weapons,

9046
06:06:35,970 --> 06:06:38,880
but the nature of their behavior is similar to ours.

9047
06:06:38,880 --> 06:06:42,840
So I think we barely know what's going on,

9048
06:06:42,840 --> 06:06:45,160
but I do think there's like a basic

9049
06:06:48,510 --> 06:06:50,253
will to cooperate.

9050
06:06:51,150 --> 06:06:53,340
A basic compassion that underlies

9051
06:06:53,340 --> 06:06:57,513
just the human spirit that's there.

9052
06:06:57,513 --> 06:07:00,120
And maybe that is just me being optimistic.

9053
06:07:00,120 --> 06:07:03,150
But if that is indeed there, then we're gonna be okay.

9054
06:07:03,150 --> 06:07:05,040
- The capacity is certainly there.

9055
06:07:05,040 --> 06:07:07,050
Whether we choose that capacity or not,

9056
06:07:07,050 --> 06:07:08,850
who knows and in what situation?

9057
06:07:08,850 --> 06:07:11,520
I think accepting that we all have the capacity

9058
06:07:11,520 --> 06:07:14,580
for both ways, for both incredible generosity

9059
06:07:14,580 --> 06:07:18,480
and kindness and also cruelty.

9060
06:07:18,480 --> 06:07:21,420
I think, Young, with this whole theory

9061
06:07:21,420 --> 06:07:23,250
of the shadow is really spot on.

9062
06:07:23,250 --> 06:07:26,490
That we all have that capacity in us

9063
06:07:26,490 --> 06:07:29,640
and accepting that it's our job

9064
06:07:29,640 --> 06:07:32,010
to attempt to cultivate the better parts

9065
06:07:32,010 --> 06:07:33,130
of our human nature

9066
06:07:34,290 --> 06:07:38,070
is weighed against our propensity

9067
06:07:38,070 --> 06:07:40,173
to sometime be the worst of ourselves.

9068
06:07:41,070 --> 06:07:43,110
- I'm excited to find out what's gonna happen.

9069
06:07:43,110 --> 06:07:44,700
It's so awesome to be human.

9070
06:07:44,700 --> 06:07:45,660
I don't wanna die.

9071
06:07:45,660 --> 06:07:47,040
I kind of wanna be alive for a while

9072
06:07:47,040 --> 06:07:49,290
to see all the cool shit we do.

9073
06:07:49,290 --> 06:07:50,940
And one of the cool things

9074
06:07:50,940 --> 06:07:53,723
I wanna see is all the software you create

9075
06:07:53,723 --> 06:07:55,316
and all the things you tweet.

9076
06:07:55,316 --> 06:07:58,683
All the trouble you get yourself into on Twitter.

9077
06:07:59,790 --> 06:08:01,786
David, yeah, I'm a huge fan like I said.

9078
06:08:01,786 --> 06:08:04,380
Thank you for everything you've done for the world,

9079
06:08:04,380 --> 06:08:07,440
for the millions of developers you've inspired,

9080
06:08:07,440 --> 06:08:09,163
and one of whom is me.

9081
06:08:09,163 --> 06:08:11,730
And thank you for this awesome conversation brother.

9082
06:08:11,730 --> 06:08:13,980
- Thanks so much for having me.

9083
06:08:13,980 --> 06:08:16,590
- Thanks for listening to this conversation with DHH.

9084
