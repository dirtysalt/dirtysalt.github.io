1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,590
- The only person who cause you more harm

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,073
than a thief with the dagger is a journalist with a pen.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,240
- The following is a conversation with Bill Ackman,

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,250
a legendary activist investor

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,200
who has been part of some of the biggest

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,680
and at times controversial trades in history.

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,420
Also, he is fearlessly vocal on X, FKA Twitter

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,410
and uses the platform to fight for ideas he believes in.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,130
For example, he was a central figure in the resignation

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,850
of the President of Harvard University, Claudine Gay,

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,793
the saga of which we discuss in this episode.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,880
This is The Lex Fridman Podcast,

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,170
to support it please check out

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,323
And now dear friends, here's Bill Ackman.

16
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,890
In your lecture on the basics of finance and investing,

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,380
you mention a book, "Intelligent Investor"

18
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,190
by Benjamin Graham as being formative in your life.

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,680
What key lesson do you take away from that book

20
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,480
that informs your own investing?

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,360
- Sure. Actually it was the first investment book I read,

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,580
and as such, it was kind of the inspiration

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,670
for my career and a lot of my life, so important book.

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,710
You know bear in mind this is sort of

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,630
after the Great Depression,

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,600
people lost confidence investing in markets,

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,060
World War II and then he writes this book,

28
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,950
it's for like the average man.

29
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,350
And basically he says that

30
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,610
you have to understand the difference

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,640
between price and value, right?

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,410
Price is what you pay,

33
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,240
value is what you get.

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,740
And he said the stock market is here to serve you.

35
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,060
And it's a bit like the neighbor that comes by every day

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,010
and makes you an offer for your house.

37
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,770
Makes you a stupid offer you ignore it,

38
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,110
makes you a great offer, you can take it.

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,160
And that's the stock market.

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,280
And the key is to figure out what something's worth

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,080
and you have to kind of weigh it.

42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,323
He talked about the difference between,

43
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:52,710
he said the stock market

44
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,570
in the short term is a voting machine.

45
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,570
It represents speculative interests,

46
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,360
supply and demand of people in the short term.

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,920
But in the long term the stock market

48
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,710
is a weighing machine, you know, much more accurate.

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,420
It's gonna tell you what something's worth.

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,240
And so if you can define what something's worth,

51
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,039
then you can really take advantage of the market

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,050
'cause it's really here to help you.

53
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,570
And that's kinda the message of the book.

54
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,530
- In that same way, there's a kind of difference

55
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,930
between speculation and investing.

56
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,253
- Yeah, speculation is just,

57
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:25,253
it's a bit like buying trading crypto, right?

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,966
- [Lex] Strong words.

59
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:29,940
- (laughs) Well, short term trading crypto,

60
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,868
maybe in the long run there's intrinsic value,

61
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:37,868
but many investors in a bubble

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,380
going into the crash were really just pure speculators.

63
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,460
They didn't know what things were worth,

64
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,260
they just knew they were going up,

65
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,210
that's speculation.

66
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,933
And investing is doing your homework,

67
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,390
digging down, understanding a business,

68
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,970
understanding the competitive dynamics of an industry,

69
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,380
understanding what management's gonna do,

70
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,090
understanding what price you're gonna pay,

71
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,720
the value of anything I would say,

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,640
other than love let's say,

73
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,320
is the present value of the cash

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,150
you can take out of it over its life.

75
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,354
Now some people think about love that way,

76
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,849
but it's not, it's not the right way to think about love,

77
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:14,682
but it's...

78
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:19,290
Yeah. So investing is about basically building a model

79
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,320
of what this business is gonna produce over its lifetime.

80
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,000
- So how do you get to that,

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,280
this idea of called value investing?

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,470
How do you get to the value of a thing,

83
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,990
even like philosophically value of anything really.

84
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,850
But we can just talk about the things

85
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,400
that are on the stock market, companies.

86
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,620
- The value of a security,

87
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,710
the value is the present value of the cash

88
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,530
you can take out of it over its life.

89
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,820
So if you think about a bond,

90
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,360
a bond pays a 5% coupon interest rate,

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,700
you get that let's say every year or twice a year,

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,990
split in half.

93
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,370
And it's very predictable.

94
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,510
And if it's a US government bond

95
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,486
you know you're gonna get it,

96
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:58,230
so that's a pretty easy thing to value.

97
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,780
A stock is an interest in a business.

98
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,970
It's like owning a piece of a company,

99
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,700
and a business, a profitable one is like a bond

100
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,820
in that it generates these coupons or these earnings

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,400
or cash flow every year.

102
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,220
The difference with a stock and a bond

103
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,709
is that the bond, it's a contract.

104
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:17,850
You know what you're gonna get

105
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,610
as long as they don't go bankrupt and default.

106
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,019
With the stock you have to make predictions

107
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,853
about the business.

108
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:24,360
You know how many widgets are gonna sell this year,

109
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,627
how many gonna sell next year?

110
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:27,900
What are the costs gonna be?

111
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,490
How much of the money that they generate

112
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,050
do they need to reinvest in the business

113
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,400
to keep the business going?

114
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,463
And that's more complicated.

115
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,180
But what we do is we try to find businesses

116
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,040
where with a very high degree of confidence,

117
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,410
we know what those cash flows are gonna be

118
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,120
for a very long time.

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,440
And the very few businesses

120
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,027
that you can have a really high degree of certainty about.

121
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:51,000
And as a result many investments are speculations

122
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,153
'cause it's really very difficult to predict the future.

123
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,070
So what we do for a living,

124
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,320
what I do for a living is find those rare companies

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
that you can kind of predict what they're gonna look like

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,590
over a very long period of time.

127
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,330
- So what are the factors that indicate

128
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,730
that a company is going to be something

129
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,290
that's going to make a lot of money,

130
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,820
it's gonna have a lot of value

131
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,030
and it's going to be reliable over a long period of time.

132
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,507
And what is your process of figuring out

133
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,753
whether a company is or isn't that?

134
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,030
- So every consumer has a view on different brands

135
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,010
and different companies.

136
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,020
And you know, what we look for

137
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,420
are sort of these non-disruptible businesses.

138
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,390
A business where you can kind of close your eyes,

139
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,700
stock market shuts for a decade

140
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,260
and you know that 10 years from now

141
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,600
it's gonna be a more valuable, more profitable company.

142
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,810
So we own a business called Universal Music Group.

143
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,150
It's in the business of helping artists

144
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,980
become global artists,

145
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,110
so recorded music business.

146
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,000
And it's in the business of owning rights

147
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,280
to sort of the music publishing rights of songwriters.

148
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,250
And you know, I think music is forever, right?

149
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,780
Music is a many thousand year old

150
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,707
part of the human experience,

151
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:07,743
and I think it will be thousands of years from now.

152
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,820
And so that's a pretty good backdrop to invest in a company.

153
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,160
And the company basically owns

154
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,043
a third of the global recorded music,

155
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,243
the most dominant sort of market share in the business.

156
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:23,880
They're the best at taking an artist who's 18 years old,

157
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,642
who's got a great voice

158
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:30,300
and has started to get a presence on YouTube and Instagram

159
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,810
and helping that artist become a superstar,

160
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,760
and that's a unique talent.

161
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,680
And the result is the best artists in the world

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,240
wanna come work for them,

163
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,450
but they also have this incredible library of the Beatles,

164
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,273
the Rolling Stones, U2, et cetera.

165
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,290
And then if you think about what music has become

166
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,510
used to be about records and CDs

167
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,407
and eight track tapes for those of whom,

168
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,070
and it was about a new format

169
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,840
and that's how they drive sales.

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,580
And it's become a business which is like

171
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,010
the podcast business about streaming.

172
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,520
And streaming is a lot more predictable

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
than selling records, right?

174
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,793
You can sort of say,

175
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:10,530
okay, how many people have smartphones?

176
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,150
How many people are gonna have smartphones next year?

177
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,920
There's a kind of global penetration

178
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,810
over time of smartphones

179
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,760
and you pay, call it 10, 11 bucks a month

180
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,270
for a subscription or last for a family plan.

181
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,673
And you can kind of build a model

182
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:25,740
of what the world looks like and predict

183
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,660
the growth of the streaming business,

184
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,070
predict what kind of market share

185
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,867
Universal's gonna have over time.

186
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,050
And you can't get to a precise view of value.

187
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,550
You can get to an approximation.

188
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,100
And the key is to buy at a price

189
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,830
that represents a big discount to that approximation.

190
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,120
And that gets back to Ben Graham.

191
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,980
Ben Graham was about what he called,

192
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,130
invented this concept of margin of safety, right?

193
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,620
You wanna buy a company at a price that if you're wrong

194
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,170
about what you think it's worth

195
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,600
and it turns out to be worth 30% less

196
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,400
you paid a deep enough discount

197
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,920
to your estimate that you're still okay.

198
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,970
It's about investing.

199
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,670
A big part of investing is not losing money.

200
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,010
If you can avoid losing money

201
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,410
and then have a few great hits,

202
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,390
you can do very, very well over time.

203
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,500
- Well, music is interesting

204
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,590
'cause yes, music's been around for a very long time,

205
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,500
but the way to make money from music has been evolving.

206
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,880
Like you mentioned streaming,

207
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,580
there's a big transition initiated by,

208
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,310
I guess Napster then created Spotify

209
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,280
of how you make money on music

210
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,860
with Apple and with all of this.

211
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,360
And the question is,

212
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,590
how well are companies like UMG able to adjust

213
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,850
to such transformations?

214
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,549
One, I could ask you about the future,

215
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,890
which is artificial intelligence

216
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,590
being able to generate music, for example.

217
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,230
There have been a lot of amazing advancements with,

218
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,090
so do you have to also think about that?

219
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,950
Like when you close your eyes,

220
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,450
all the things you think about,

221
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,130
are you imagining the possible ways

222
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,030
that the future's completely different from the present

223
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,920
and how well this company will be able to

224
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,690
surf the wave of that?

225
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,400
- Sure. And they've had to surf a lot of waves.

226
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,980
And actually the music business peaked the last time

227
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,310
in like the late '90s or 2000 timeframe.

228
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,540
And that really innovation,

229
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,230
Napster digitization of music almost killed the industry.

230
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,070
And Universal really led an effort to save the industry

231
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,640
and actually made an early deal with Spotify that enabled

232
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,400
the industry to really recover.

233
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,807
And so by virtue of their market position

234
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:27,120
and their credibility and their willingness

235
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,250
to kind of adopt new technologies,

236
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,240
they've kept their position.

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Now they of course had this huge advantage.

238
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,540
'Cause I think the Beatles are forever.

239
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,130
I think U2 is forever.

240
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,290
I think Rolling Stones are forever.

241
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,790
So they had a nice base of assets that were important

242
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,290
and I think will forever be,

243
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,640
and forever is a long time.

244
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:48,720
But you know, again, there's enormous,

245
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,250
there are all kinds of risks in every business.

246
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,083
This is one that I think

247
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,950
has a very high degree of persistence.

248
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,300
And I can't envision a world where beyond streaming

249
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,370
in a sense, now you may have a Neuralink chip in your head

250
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,790
instead of a phone,

251
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,120
but the music can come in a digitized kind of format.

252
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,040
You're gonna wanna have an infinite library

253
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,770
that you can walk around in your pocket or in your brain.

254
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,440
It's not gonna matter that much if the form factor,

255
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,560
the device changes, it's not really that important

256
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,940
whether it's Spotify or Apple

257
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,480
or Amazon that are the so-called DSPs

258
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,043
or the providers.

259
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,420
I think the values really gonna reside

260
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,730
in the content owners,

261
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,880
and that's really the artists and the label.

262
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,540
- And I actually think AI is not going to be

263
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,130
the primary creator of music.

264
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,970
I think we're going to actually face the reality

265
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,030
that it's not that music has been around

266
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,490
for a thousands of years,

267
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,820
but musicians and music has been around.

268
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,560
Like we actually care to know

269
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,420
who's the musician that created it.

270
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,760
Just like we wanna know that who's the artist,

271
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,010
human artists that created a piece of art.

272
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,843
- I totally agree.

273
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,200
And I think if you think about it

274
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
there's other lots of other technologies

275
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,550
and computers that have been used

276
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,650
to generate music over time,

277
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,200
but no one falls in love

278
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,083
with a computer generated track, right?

279
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:15,900
And you know, Taylor Swift,

280
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,160
you know incredible music,

281
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,010
but it's also about the artist and her story

282
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,010
and her physical presence and the live experience.

283
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,060
I don't think you're gonna sit there

284
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,280
and someone's gonna put a computer up on stage

285
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,050
and it's gonna play

286
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,310
and people are gonna get excited around it.

287
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,490
So I think AI is really gonna be a tool

288
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,900
to make artists better artists

289
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,680
and I think like a synthesizer, right?

290
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,690
Really created the opportunity for

291
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,140
one man to have an orchestra.

292
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,903
Maybe a bit of a threat to a percussionist,

293
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,050
but maybe not, maybe it drove even more demand

294
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,300
for the live experience.

295
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,500
- Unless that computer has human-like sentience,

296
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,870
which I believe is a real possibility.

297
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,480
But then it's really from a business perspective

298
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,710
no different than a human.

299
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,340
If it has an identity that's basically fame and an influence

300
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,680
and there'll be a robot Taylor Swift

301
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,513
and it doesn't really matter--

302
00:12:14,513 --> 00:12:16,740
- That's a copyrightable asset I would think.

303
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,170
- [Lex] And then there'll be--

304
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,183
- I'm not sure that's the world I'm excited about.

305
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,430
- Well, that's a different discussion.

306
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,020
The world is not gonna ask your permission

307
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,420
to become what it's becoming

308
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,310
but you could still make money on it.

309
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,930
Presumably there'd be a capital system

310
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,570
and there'd be some laws under which,

311
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,640
which I believe AI systems will have

312
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,920
rights that are akin to human rights

313
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,770
and we're gonna have to contend with what that means.

314
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,620
- Well there's sort of name and likeness rights

315
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,880
that have to be protected now.

316
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,220
Can a name be attributed to a Tesla robot?

317
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,640
I don't know.

318
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,473
- I think so.

319
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:52,710
I think it's quite obvious to me.

320
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,750
- Okay, so those are more potential artists for us

321
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,590
to represent at Universal.

322
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,270
- Exactly. Exactly.

323
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,200
- That's sort of one example.

324
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,480
Another example could be just the restaurant industry.

325
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,007
If you can look at businesses like a McDonald's, right?

326
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:07,890
It's a whatever the company's like a 1950 vintage business

327
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,500
and here we are 75 years later

328
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,420
and you can kind of predict

329
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,890
what it's gonna look like over time

330
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,990
and the menu's gonna adjust over time

331
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,050
to consumer tastes but I think the hamburger

332
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,550
and fries is probably forever.

333
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,070
- The Beetles, the Rolling Stones,

334
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,870
the hamburger and fries are forever.

335
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,840
I was eating at Chipotle last night

336
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,970
as I was preparing these notes (laughs)

337
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,452
- Thank you.

338
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:34,590
- And yeah, it is one of my favorite places to eat.

339
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,430
You said it is a place that you eat,

340
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,733
well, you obviously also invest in it.

341
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,490
What do you get at Chipotle?

342
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,380
- I tend to get a double chicken.

343
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,090
- Bowl or burrito?

344
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,200
- I like the burrito,

345
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,710
but I generally try to order the bowl, cut the carb.

346
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,090
- [Lex] For health reasons. Alright.

347
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,960
- And double chicken, guac, lettuce, black beans.

348
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,270
- And I'm more of a steak guy.

349
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,283
Just putting that on the record.

350
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,330
What's the actual process you go through?

351
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:08,250
Like literally like the process of figuring out

352
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,200
what the value of a company is?

353
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,450
Like how do you do the research?

354
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,740
Is it reading documents?

355
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,300
Is it talking to people?

356
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,230
How do you do it?

357
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,160
- It's all the above.

358
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,110
So Chipotle, what attracted us initially

359
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,350
is the stock price dropped by about 50%.

360
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,423
Great company, great concept,

361
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,150
you know athletes love it.

362
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,710
Consumers love it.

363
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,170
Healthy, sustainable fresh food

364
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,460
made in front of your eyes.

365
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,780
And great Steve Ells, the founder did an amazing job,

366
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,110
but ultimately the company's lacking some of the systems

367
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,270
and had a food safety issue.

368
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,420
Consumers got sick, almost killed the rent.

369
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,960
But the reality of the fast food quick service industry

370
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,330
is almost every fast food company

371
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,820
has had a food safety issue over time,

372
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,220
and the vast majority have survived.

373
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,470
And we said, look, it's such a great concept,

374
00:14:59,643 --> 00:15:00,767
but their approach was not,

375
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,250
it was far from my deal,

376
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,070
but we start with usually reading the SEC filing.

377
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,710
So companies file a 10 k or an annual report,

378
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,200
they file these quarterly reports called 10 Qs.

379
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,100
They have a proxy statement

380
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,450
which describes kinda the governance,

381
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,160
the board structure,

382
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,710
conference call transcripts are publicly available.

383
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:19,350
It's kind of very helpful to go back five years

384
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,430
and kinda learn the story.

385
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,280
You know here's how management describes their business,

386
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,537
here's what they say they're gonna do,

387
00:15:24,537 --> 00:15:27,102
and you can follow along to see what they do.

388
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,187
It's like a historical record

389
00:15:29,187 --> 00:15:33,990
of how competent and truthful they are.

390
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,520
It's a very useful device.

391
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,490
And then of course looking at competitors

392
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,123
and thinking about what could dislodge this company?

393
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:45,253
And then we'll talk to,

394
00:15:45,253 --> 00:15:47,250
if it's an industry we don't know well

395
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,110
we know the restaurant industry really well,

396
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,360
music industry, we'll talk to people in the industry.

397
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,430
We'll try to understand

398
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,410
the difference between publishing and recorded music.

399
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,740
We'll look at the competitors, we'll talk to...

400
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,580
We'll read books.

401
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,530
I read a book about the music industry

402
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,380
or a couple books about the industry.

403
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,173
So it's a bit like a big research project.

404
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,890
And there are these so-called expert networks now

405
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,140
and you can get pretty much anyone on the phone

406
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,290
and they'll talk to you about an aspect of the industry

407
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,560
that you don't understand, wanna learn more about,

408
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,550
try to get a sense.

409
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,050
Public filings of companies

410
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,670
generally give you a lot of information

411
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,350
but not everything you wanna know.

412
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,270
And you can learn more by talking to experts

413
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,050
about some of the industry dynamics, the personalities.

414
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,000
You wanna get a sense of management.

415
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,880
I like watching podcasts.

416
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,290
If a CEO were to do a podcast

417
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,280
or a YouTube interview,

418
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,170
you get a sense of the people.

419
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,603
- So in the case of Chipotle, for example,

420
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:42,767
by the way, I could talk about Chipotle all day.

421
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,060
I just love it. I love it.

422
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,410
I wish there was a sponsor.

423
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:48,630
(both chuckling)

424
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,980
- I'll mention it to the CEO.

425
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,960
- Don't make promises you can't keep Bill.

426
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,983
- I'm not making, I can't.

427
00:16:52,983 --> 00:16:55,260
Brian Nichols a fantastic CEO,

428
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,550
he's not gonna spend $1

429
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,733
that he doesn't think its the company's best interest.

430
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,483
- All right. All I want is free Chipotle, come on now.

431
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:04,079
What was I saying?

432
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,359
Oh, and so you look at a company like Chipotle

433
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,720
and then you see there's a difficult moment in its history

434
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,660
like you said that there was a food safety issue.

435
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,492
And then you say,

436
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,650
okay, well I see a path where we can fix this

437
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,470
and therefore even though the price is low,

438
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,223
we can get it to where the price goes up to its value.

439
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,119
- So the kind of business we're looking for

440
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,470
is sort of the kind of business

441
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,940
everyone should be looking for, right?

442
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,230
A great business.

443
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,260
It's got a long-term trajectory of growth

444
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,470
out into you know even beyond the foreseeable distance.

445
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,790
Those are the kinda businesses you wanna own.

446
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,070
You want businesses that generate a lot of cash.

447
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,260
You want businesses you can easily understand.

448
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,550
You want businesses with these sort of

449
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,660
huge barriers to entry

450
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,610
where it's difficult for others to compete.

451
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,630
You want companies that don't have

452
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,073
to constantly raise capital.

453
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,860
And these are some of the great business of the world,

454
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,000
but people have figured out

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,260
that those are the great businesses.

456
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,850
So the problem is those companies

457
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,650
tend to have very high stock prices

458
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,470
and the value is generally built into

459
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,670
the price you have to pay for the business.

460
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,600
So we can't earn the kind of returns we wanna earn

461
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,030
for investors by paying a really high price.

462
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,200
Price matters a lot.

463
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,490
You can buy the best business in the world

464
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,320
and if you overpay,

465
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,230
you're not gonna earn particularly attractive returns.

466
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,420
So we get involved in cases where

467
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,710
a great business has kind of made a big mistake

468
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,470
or you've a company that's kinda lost its way,

469
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,820
but it's recoverable.

470
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,760
And we buy from shareholders who are disappointed,

471
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,610
who've lost confidence selling at a low price

472
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,310
relative to what it's worth if fixed

473
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,910
and then we try to be helpful in fixing the company.

474
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,030
- You said that barriers to entry,

475
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:45,390
you said a lot of really interesting qualities

476
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,780
of companies very quickly in a sequence of statements

477
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,300
that took like less than 10 seconds to say,

478
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,920
but some of them were fascinating,

479
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,910
all of them were fascinating.

480
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,980
So you said barriers to entry.

481
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,370
How do you know if there's a type of moat

482
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:04,370
protecting the competitors from stepping up to the play?

483
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,810
- The most difficult analysis to do as an investor

484
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:11,013
is kind of figuring out how wide is the moat,

485
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:16,110
how much at risk is the business to disruption?

486
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,730
And we're in, I would say

487
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,270
the greatest period of disruptive ability in history, right?

488
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,600
Technology, you know, a couple of 19 year olds

489
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,850
can leave whatever university

490
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,310
or maybe they didn't even go in the first place.

491
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,250
They can raise millions of dollars.

492
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,180
They can get access to infinite bandwidth storage.

493
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,820
They can contract with engineers

494
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,030
in low cost markets around the world.

495
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,860
They could build a virtual company

496
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,210
and they can disrupt businesses

497
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,400
that seem super established over time.

498
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,233
And then on top of that,

499
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,070
you have major companies

500
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,440
with multi-trillion dollar market caps

501
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,990
working to find profits wherever they can.

502
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,000
And so that's a dangerous world

503
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,500
in a way to be an investor.

504
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,080
And so you wanna, you have to find businesses

505
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,870
that it's hard to foresee a world

506
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,703
in which they get disrupted.

507
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,387
And the beauty of the restaurant business,

508
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:09,120
and we've actually, our best track record is in restaurants.

509
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,830
We've never lost money.

510
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,900
We've only made a fortune interestingly,

511
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,340
investing restaurants.

512
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,500
A big part of, it's a really simple business.

513
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,050
And if you get Chipotle right

514
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,060
and you're at a hundred stores

515
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,940
it's not so hard to envision getting to 200 stores

516
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,040
and then getting to 500 stores, right?

517
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,620
And the key is maintaining the brand image,

518
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,180
growing intelligently,

519
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,410
having the right systems

520
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,030
and when you go from 100 stores to 3,500 stores,

521
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,282
you have to know what you're doing.

522
00:20:37,282 --> 00:20:38,970
And there's a lot of complexity, right?

523
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,283
If you think about your local restaurant,

524
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,580
the family's working in the business,

525
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,710
they're watching the cash register

526
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:51,150
and you can probably open another restaurant across town.

527
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,950
But there are very few restaurant operators

528
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,690
that own more than a few restaurants

529
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,980
and operate them successfully.

530
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,190
And the quick service business is about systems

531
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,720
and building a model

532
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,810
that a stranger who doesn't know the restaurant industry

533
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,940
can come in and enter the business

534
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,600
and build a successful franchise.

535
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,130
Now, Chipotle's not a franchise company,

536
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,840
they actually own all their own stores,

537
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,610
but many of the most successful restaurant companies

538
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,580
are franchise models like a Burger King, a McDonald's,

539
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,730
Tim Horton's, you know, all these various brands, Popeye's.

540
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,080
And there it's about systems,

541
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,580
but the same systems apply

542
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,047
whether you own all the stores

543
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:26,880
and it's run by a big corporation

544
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,130
or whether the owners of the restaurants

545
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,220
are sort of franchisees, you know, local entrepreneurs.

546
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,130
- So if the restaurant has scaled to a certain number

547
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,600
that means they've figured out

548
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,977
some kind of system that works

549
00:21:37,977 --> 00:21:40,230
and it's very difficult to develop that kind of system,

550
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,520
so that's a moat.

551
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,010
- A moat is you get to a certain scale

552
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,600
and you do it successfully.

553
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,100
And the brand is now understood by the consumer.

554
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,070
And what's interesting about Chipotle is

555
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,810
what they've achieved is difficult, right?

556
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,690
They're not buying frozen hamburgers getting shipped in.

557
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,490
They're buying fresh

558
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,770
sustainably sourced ingredients,

559
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,210
preparing food in the store.

560
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,440
That was a first, right?

561
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,930
The quality of the product at Chipotle is incredible,

562
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,300
it's the highest quality food you can get for,

563
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,630
you can get a serious dinner for under 20 bucks

564
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,820
and eat really healthfully

565
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,030
and very high quality ingredients,

566
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,920
and that's just not available anywhere else.

567
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,180
And it's very hard to replicate

568
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,410
and to build those relationships

569
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,720
with farmers around the country.

570
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,860
It's a lot easier to make a deal with

571
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,340
one of the big massive food producers

572
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,260
and buy your pork from them

573
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,520
than to buy from a whole bunch of farmers

574
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,420
around the country.

575
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,570
And so that is a big moat for Chipotle.

576
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,100
Very difficult to replicate.

577
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,420
- And by the way, another company

578
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,910
I think you have a steak is McDonald's?

579
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,250
- No, we own a company called Restaurant Brands.

580
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,890
Restaurant Brands owns a number of quick service companies,

581
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,492
one of which is Burger King.

582
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:49,325
- Burger King?

583
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:50,158
- Yeah.

584
00:22:50,158 --> 00:22:51,930
- Okay, well it's been a meme for a while,

585
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:55,410
but burger King is great too, Wendy's whatever,

586
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,300
but usually I go McDonald's,

587
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,890
I'll just eat burger patties.

588
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,420
I don't know if you knew you could do this

589
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,480
but a burger patty at Burger King can do this,

590
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,580
McDonald's, it's actually way cheaper.

591
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,413
- They'll just sell you the patty.

592
00:23:06,413 --> 00:23:07,770
- The patty and it's cheap.

593
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,890
It's like a $1.50 or $2 for per patty

594
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,250
and it's about 250 calories and it's just meat.

595
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,480
And despite like the criticism of memes out there, that's--

596
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,313
- [Bill] Pretty healthy stuff.

597
00:23:19,313 --> 00:23:20,146
- It's healthy stuff.

598
00:23:20,146 --> 00:23:21,990
And so when I go...

599
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,750
The healthiest I feel is when I do carnivore,

600
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,830
it doesn't sound healthy,

601
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,110
but if I eat only meat, I feel really good.

602
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,870
I lose weight, I have all this energy. It's crazy.

603
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,280
And when I'm traveling

604
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,311
the easiest way to get meat is that.

605
00:23:34,311 --> 00:23:35,910
- Is you go to McDonald's, you order six patties.

606
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,340
- Exactly. So there's this sad meme

607
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,770
of me just sitting alone in a car when I'm traveling,

608
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,690
just eating beef patties at McDonald's.

609
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,523
But I love it.

610
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:44,940
And you gotta do what you love,

611
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,773
what makes you happy,

612
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:46,729
and that's what makes me happy.

613
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:47,562
- I think we should maybe

614
00:23:47,562 --> 00:23:48,690
we'll have Burger King feature in it.

615
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,680
What about Flame World?

616
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,000
What's with these fried burgers?

617
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,970
We gotta get you to Burger King grilled burgers.

618
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,160
- Wait, is this like fast food trash?

619
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,090
I didn't know.

620
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,700
I don't know the details of how they're made.

621
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,533
I don't have allegiance.

622
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:01,527
- I think we got a chance

623
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:02,360
to switch you to Burger King.

624
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,603
- Great. We'll see.

625
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,830
I'm making so many deals today, it's wonderful.

626
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,510
Okay, you were talking about moats

627
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,140
and this kind of remind me of Alphabet, the parent company.

628
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,780
- Sure. It's a big position for us.

629
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,680
- So it's interesting that you think that

630
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,183
maybe Alphabet fits some of these characteristics.

631
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,300
It's tricky to know with everything

632
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,640
that's happening in AI,

633
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,950
and I'm interviewing Sundar Pichai soon.

634
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,960
It's interesting that you think that there's a moat.

635
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,233
And it's also interesting to analyze that,

636
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:38,460
'cause the consumer is just a fan of technology.

637
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,270
Why is Google still around like they've been,

638
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,470
it's not just a search engine,

639
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,933
it's doing it all the basics

640
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,150
of the business of search really well

641
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,290
but they're doing all these other stuff.

642
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:51,840
So what's your analysis of Alphabet?

643
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,340
Why are you still positive about it?

644
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,790
- Sure. So it's a business we've admired as a firm

645
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,433
for whatever, 15 years,

646
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,750
but rarely got to a price that we felt we could own it.

647
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,370
Because again, the expectations were so high

648
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,440
and price really matters.

649
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,900
And really the sort of AI scare I would call it.

650
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,510
You know Microsoft comes out with Chat GPT,

651
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,010
they do an amazing demonstration.

652
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,140
People like this most incredible product.

653
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,020
And Google, which had been working on AI even earlier,

654
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,290
obviously the Microsoft was behind an AI.

655
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,917
It was really their chat GPT deal that gave them

656
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,773
a kind of a market presence.

657
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,010
And then Google does this

658
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,450
fairly disastrous demonstration of Bard and the world says,

659
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,630
oh my god, Google's fallen behind an AI.

660
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,600
AI is the future.

661
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,190
Stock gets crushed.

662
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,893
Google gets to a price around 15 times earnings,

663
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,130
which for a business of this quality

664
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,110
is an extremely low price.

665
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,990
And our view on Google,

666
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,170
one way to think about it when a business becomes a verb,

667
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,000
that's usually pretty good sign about

668
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,200
the mode around the business.

669
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,180
So you'd open your computer

670
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,800
and you open your search

671
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,990
and very high percentage of the world

672
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,790
starts with a Google page

673
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:07,080
and a one line where you type in your search.

674
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,570
You know the Google advertising search,

675
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,670
YouTube franchise is one of the most

676
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,490
dominant franchises in the world.

677
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,993
Very difficult to disrupt,

678
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,270
extremely profitable.

679
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,490
The world is moving from offline advertising

680
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,540
to online advertising

681
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,610
and that trend I think continues. Why?

682
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,537
Because you can actually see whether your ads work.

683
00:26:25,537 --> 00:26:27,400
They used to say about advertising

684
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,040
spend a fortune and you just don't know

685
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,300
which 50% of it's works,

686
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,380
but you just sort of spend the money

687
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,120
'cause you know, ultimately

688
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,500
that's gonna bring in the customer.

689
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,090
And now with online advertising,

690
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,870
you can see with granularity which dollars I'm spending.

691
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,790
You know when people click on the search term

692
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,777
and end up buying something

693
00:26:45,777 --> 00:26:48,630
and I pay, it's a very high return

694
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,880
on investment for the advertiser

695
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,010
and they really dominate that business.

696
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:55,110
Now AI of course is a risk

697
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,820
if all of a sudden people start searching

698
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,240
or asking questions of Chat GPT

699
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,160
and don't start with the Google search bar,

700
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,420
that's a risk to the company.

701
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,820
And so our view based on work we had done

702
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,410
and talked to industry experts

703
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:10,350
is that Google if anything had a,

704
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,510
by virtue of the investment they've made,

705
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,910
the time, the energy that people put into it,

706
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,160
we felt their AI capabilities were

707
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,120
if anything potentially greater than Microsoft Chat GPT

708
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,460
and that the market had overreacted.

709
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,430
And because Google is a big company

710
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,960
global business regulators

711
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,670
scrutinized it incredibly carefully.

712
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,620
They couldn't take some of the same liberties

713
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,050
a startup like OpenAI did in releasing a product.

714
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,780
And I think Google took a more cautious approach

715
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,490
in releasing an early version of Bard

716
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,680
in terms of its capabilities.

717
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,560
And that led the world to believe that they were behind.

718
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,580
And we ultimately concluded,

719
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,650
if any they're tied or ahead

720
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,756
and you're paying nothing for that potential business.

721
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,923
And they also have huge advantages by virtue.

722
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,160
If you think of all the data Google has,

723
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,930
like the search data, all the various applications,

724
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,550
you know, email and otherwise

725
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,470
the kinda the Google suite of products,

726
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,730
it's an incredible data set.

727
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,950
So they have more training data

728
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,390
than pretty much any company in the world.

729
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,500
They have incredible engineers,

730
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,720
they have enormous financial resources

731
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,460
so that was kind of the bet.

732
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,850
And we still think it's probably the cheapest

733
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,950
of the big seven companies

734
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,660
in terms of price you're paying for the business

735
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,640
relative to its current earnings.

736
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,870
It also is a business

737
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,500
that has a lot of potential for efficiency.

738
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,340
Sometimes when you have this

739
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,313
enormously profitable dominant company,

740
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,880
all of the technology companies in the post March 20 world

741
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,840
grew enormously in terms of their teams

742
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,217
and they probably overhired.

743
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:42,480
And so you've seen some,

744
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,330
the Facebooks of the world and now even Google

745
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,500
starting to get a little more efficient

746
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,150
in terms of their operation.

747
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,050
So we bet a low multiple for the business.

748
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,010
One way to think about the value

749
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,920
of the business is the price you pay for the earnings

750
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,990
or alternatively what's the yield.

751
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,120
If you flip over the price over the earnings,

752
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,070
it gives you kind of the yield of the business.

753
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,950
So a 15 multiple is about

754
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,570
almost a seven and a half percent yield

755
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,390
and that earnings yield is growing over time

756
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,160
as the business grows

757
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,310
compare to what you can earn

758
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,810
lending your money to the government,

759
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,030
4%, that's a very attractive going in yield.

760
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,563
And then there's all kinds of

761
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:21,420
what we call optionality

762
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,500
in all the various businesses

763
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,023
and investments they've made that are losing money.

764
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:27,150
They've got a cloud business that's growing very rapidly,

765
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,610
but they're investing basically 100% of the profits

766
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,080
from that business and growth.

767
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,580
So you're in that earnings number,

768
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,500
you're not seeing any earnings from the cloud business

769
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,900
and you know, they're one of the top cloud players.

770
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,690
So very interesting,

771
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,490
generally well-managed company

772
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,433
with incredible assets and resources and dominance,

773
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,530
and it has no debt.

774
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,750
It's got a ton of cash.

775
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,253
And so pretty good story.

776
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,310
- Is there something fundamentally different

777
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,180
about AI that makes all of this more complicated,

778
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,080
which is the sort of the exponential possibilities

779
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,580
of the kinds of products

780
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,240
and impact that AI could create

781
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,550
when you're looking at Meta,

782
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:12,330
Microsoft, Alphabet, Google, all these companies,

783
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,633
xAI or maybe startups,

784
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,900
is there some more risk introduced

785
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,820
by the possibilities of AI?

786
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,720
- Absolutely. That's a great question.

787
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,040
You know business investing is about finding companies

788
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,690
that can't be disrupted.

789
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,100
AI is the ultimate disruptable asset or technology.

790
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,460
And that's what makes investing treacherous

791
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,410
is that you own a business that's enormously profitable.

792
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,690
Management gets, if you will, fat and happy

793
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,190
and then a new technology emerges

794
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,860
that just takes away all their profitability.

795
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,690
And AI is this incredibly powerful tool,

796
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,030
which is why every business is saying,

797
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,950
how can I use AI in my business

798
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,500
to make us more profitable, more successful,

799
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,800
grow faster and also disrupt

800
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,634
or protect ourself from the incomings,

801
00:30:59,634 --> 00:31:00,840
It's a bit like, you know,

802
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,740
Buffett talks about a great business like a castle

803
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,660
surrounded by this really wide moat,

804
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,920
but you have all these barbarians

805
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,570
trying to get in and steal the princess

806
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,340
and it happens.

807
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,660
You know, Kodak for example,

808
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,690
was an amazing, incredibly dominant company

809
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,460
until it disappeared.

810
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,840
Polaroid, this incredible technology

811
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,890
and that's why we have tended to stay away

812
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,690
from companies that are technology companies.

813
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,400
'Cause technology companies generally

814
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,810
the world is such a dynamic place.

815
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,450
It's one's always working on a better version.

816
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,790
And you know, Kodak was caught up

817
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,550
in the analog film world

818
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,110
and then the world changed.

819
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,510
- Well, Google was pretty fat and happy

820
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,280
until Chat GPT came out.

821
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,520
How would you rate their ability to wake up,

822
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,970
lose weight, and be less happy

823
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,710
and aggressively rediscover their search for happiness?

824
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,560
- I think you've seen a lot of that in the last year

825
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,520
and I would say some combination of embarrassment

826
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,700
and pride are huge motivators

827
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,130
for everyone from Sergey Brin,

828
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,495
to the management of the company.

829
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,840
- And Demis Hassabis has thrown 'em into the picture

830
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,960
and all of DeepMind teams and the unification teams

831
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,100
and like all the shakeups.

832
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,590
It was interesting to watch the chaos, I love it.

833
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,050
I love it when everybody freaks out,

834
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,570
like you said, partly embarrassment

835
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,720
and partly that competitive drive that drives engineers

836
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,520
it was great, I can't wait to see

837
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,490
what there've been just a lot of improvement in the product

838
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,110
let's see where it goes.

839
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,240
You mentioned management,

840
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,240
how do you analyze the governance structure

841
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,220
and the individual humans

842
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,750
that are the managers of a company?

843
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,670
- So as I like to say, incentives drive all human behavior

844
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:50,400
and that certainly applies in the business world.

845
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,220
So understanding the people and what drives them

846
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,230
and what the actual financial

847
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,460
and other incentives of a business

848
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:59,730
are very important part of the analysis

849
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,080
for investing in a company.

850
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,903
And you can learn a lot.

851
00:33:02,903 --> 00:33:04,020
You know I mentioned before

852
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,050
one great way to learn about a business is go back a decade

853
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,210
and read everything that management has written

854
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,610
about the business and see what they've done over time.

855
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,510
See what they've said.

856
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:17,310
Conference calls are actually relatively recent.

857
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,210
When I started in the business,

858
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,860
there weren't conference call transcripts.

859
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,650
Now you have a written record

860
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,000
of everything management has said

861
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,920
in response to questions from analysts

862
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,170
at conferences and otherwise.

863
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,210
You learn a lot about people by listening

864
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,276
to what they say, how they answer questions

865
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,720
and ultimately their track record

866
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,370
for doing what they say they're gonna do.

867
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:37,470
Do they under promise and over deliver?

868
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,900
Do they over promise and under deliver?

869
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,280
Do they say what they're gonna do?

870
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,693
Do they admit mistakes?

871
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,530
Do they build great teams?

872
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,480
Do people wanna come work for them

873
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
or are they able to retain their talent?

874
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,390
And then part of the is do they,

875
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,010
how much are they running the business

876
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:56,970
for the benefit of the business?

877
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,810
How much are they running the business

878
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,310
for the benefit of themselves?

879
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,297
And that's kind of the analysis you do.

880
00:34:03,297 --> 00:34:05,880
- Are we talking about CEO, COO?

881
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,650
What does management mean?

882
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,330
Oh, how deep does it go?

883
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:13,050
- Sure. So this very senior management matters enormously.

884
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,909
We used the Chipotle example,

885
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,679
Steve Ell's great entrepreneur,

886
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,610
business got to a scale

887
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,530
he really couldn't run it.

888
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,670
We recruited a guy named Brian,

889
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:23,170
helped a company recruit a guy named Brian Nichol.

890
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,190
And he was considered the best person

891
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,810
in the quick service industry.

892
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,150
He came in and completely rebuild the company.

893
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,920
Actually we moved the company,

894
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,260
Chipotle was moved to California.

895
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,690
And sometimes one way to redo the culture

896
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,090
of a company is just to move it geographically

897
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,530
and then you can kind of reboot the business.

898
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,440
But a great leader has great followership,

899
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,730
well over the course of their career

900
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:45,810
they'll have a team they've built

901
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,460
that will come follow them into the next opportunity.

902
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,580
But the key is,

903
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,170
really the top person matters enormously

904
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:55,581
and then it's who they recruit.

905
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,410
You know you recruit an A+ leader

906
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,679
and they're gonna recruit other A type people.

907
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,512
You recruit a B leader,

908
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:04,563
you're not gonna recruit any great talent beneath them.

909
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,500
- You mentioned Warren Buffett,

910
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,590
you said you admire him as an investor.

911
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,210
What do you find most interesting

912
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,953
and powerful about his approach?

913
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,950
What aspects of his approach

914
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,800
to investing do you also practice?

915
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,210
- Sure. So most of what I've learned

916
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,890
in the investment business, I learned from Warren Buffett.

917
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:26,250
He's been my great professor of this business.

918
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,480
My first book I read in the business

919
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,390
was the Ben Graham "Intelligent Investor".

920
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,150
But fairly quickly you get to learn about Warren Buffett

921
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:33,983
and I started by reading

922
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:36,510
the Berkshire Hathaway and reports.

923
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,420
And then I eventually got the buffet partnership letters

924
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,940
that you can see, which are an amazing read

925
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,520
to go back to the mid 1950s

926
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,740
and read what he wrote to his limited partners

927
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,640
when he first started out

928
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,980
and just follow that trajectory over a long period of time.

929
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,700
So what's remarkable about him is one, duration, right?

930
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,173
He still added it at '93,

931
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,403
two, you know, it takes a very long-term view.

932
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,030
But a big thing that you learn from him,

933
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:05,460
investing requires this incredible

934
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,490
dispassionate on emotional quality.

935
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,700
You have to be extremely economically rational,

936
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,270
which is not a basic,

937
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,010
it's not something you learn in the jungle.

938
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,590
I don't think it's something that, you know,

939
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,490
if you think about

940
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,420
surviving the jungle the lion shows up

941
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,310
and everyone starts running, you run with them.

942
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,590
That does not work well in markets.

943
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,540
In fact, you generally have to do the opposite, right?

944
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,580
When the lemmings are running over the cliff,

945
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,260
that's the time where you're facing the other direction

946
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,400
and you're running the other direction,

947
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,360
i.e you're stepping in,

948
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,913
you're buying stocks at really low prices.

949
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,760
Buffet's been great at that

950
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,950
and great at teaching about what he calls temperament,

951
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,770
which is this sort of emotional kind of

952
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:53,040
or unemotional quality that you need

953
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,810
to be able to dispassionately look at the world

954
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:57,720
and say, okay, is this a real risk,

955
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,013
are people overreacting?

956
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,220
People tend to get excited about investments

957
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,630
when stocks are going up

958
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,490
and they get depressed when they're going down.

959
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,650
And I think that's just inherently human.

960
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:08,483
You have to reverse that.

961
00:37:08,483 --> 00:37:11,430
You have to get excited when things get cheaper

962
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:14,433
and you gotta get concerned when things get more expensive.

963
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,820
- You've been a part of some big battles,

964
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,490
some big losses, some big wins.

965
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,620
So it's been a rollercoaster.

966
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,440
So in terms of temperament psychologically,

967
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,530
how do you not let that break you?

968
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:32,880
How do you maintain a calm demeanor

969
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,680
and avoid running with the lemmings?

970
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,160
- I think it's something you kind of learn over time.

971
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,100
A key success factor is

972
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,600
you wanna have enough money in the bank

973
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,850
that you're gonna survive

974
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:48,720
regardless of what's going on with volatility in markets.

975
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,440
One, you shouldn't borrow money.

976
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,640
So if you borrow money,

977
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,650
you own stocks on margin,

978
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:57,150
markets are going down

979
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,940
and you have your livelihood at risk,

980
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,620
it's very difficult to be rational.

981
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,780
So key is getting yourself to a place

982
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,270
where you're financially secure,

983
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,250
you're not gonna lose your house, right?

984
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:11,010
That's a kind of a key thing.

985
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,970
And then also doing your homework, stock prices.

986
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,640
Stocks can trade at any price in the short term.

987
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,440
And if you know what a business is worth

988
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,500
and you understand the management,

989
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,850
you know it extremely well,

990
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,650
it doesn't bother you when a stock price goes down

991
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,240
or it has much less impact on you

992
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,722
because you know, again, as Mr. Graham said,

993
00:38:33,722 --> 00:38:35,490
you know, the short term, the market's a voting machine,

994
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,330
you have a bunch of lemmings

995
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:38,250
voting one direction that's concerning.

996
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,400
But if it's a great business doesn't have a lot of debt

997
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,600
and people are gonna just listen

998
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,160
to more music next year than this year,

999
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,930
you know you're gonna do well.

1000
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:50,490
So it's a bit some combination of being personally secure

1001
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:53,310
and also just knowing what you own

1002
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,310
and over time you build calluses, I would say.

1003
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:01,830
- So psychologically, just as a human being

1004
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,680
speaking of lions and gazelle and all this kind of stuff.

1005
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,270
Is it as simple as just being financially secure?

1006
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,750
Is there some just human qualities

1007
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,980
that you have to be born with/develop?

1008
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,020
- I think so. I think

1009
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,680
I'm a pretty emotional person I would say.

1010
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,860
Or I feel pretty strong emotions, but not in investing.

1011
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,790
I'm remarkably immune to kind of volatility

1012
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,770
and that's a big advantage

1013
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,990
and it took some time for me to develop that.

1014
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,370
- So you weren't born with that, you think?

1015
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:36,203
- [Bill] No.

1016
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:40,320
- So being emotional, do you want to respond to volatility?

1017
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,540
- Yeah. And you just, it's a bit...

1018
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,720
Again, you can learn a lot from other people's experience.

1019
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,910
It's one of the few businesses

1020
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,830
where you can learn an enormous amount

1021
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:53,163
by reading about other periods in history.

1022
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:58,830
Following Buffet's career, the mistakes he made.

1023
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:00,600
If you're investing a lot of capital,

1024
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,970
every one of your mistakes can be big.

1025
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,280
So we've made big mistakes.

1026
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,140
The good news is that the vast majority

1027
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,757
of things we've done have worked out really well.

1028
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:12,510
And so that also gives you confidence over time.

1029
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,390
But because we make very few investments,

1030
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,710
we own eight things today

1031
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,653
or seven companies of that matter,

1032
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,430
if we get one wrong, it's gonna be big news.

1033
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,380
And so the other nature of our business

1034
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,590
you have to be comfortable with a lot of public scrutiny,

1035
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,600
a lot of public criticism

1036
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,080
and that requires some experience.

1037
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,340
I call it that.

1038
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,860
- I think we'll talk about some of that.

1039
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,420
Financially secure is something

1040
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,740
I believe also recommend

1041
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,410
for even just to everyday investors.

1042
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,370
Is there some general advice

1043
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,330
from the things you've been talking about

1044
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,190
that applies to everyday investors?

1045
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:55,080
- Sure. So never invest money you can't afford to lose

1046
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,047
where it would if you'd lost this money

1047
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:00,423
and you lose your house, et cetera.

1048
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,610
Being in a place where you're investing money

1049
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,002
that you don't care about the price in the short term,

1050
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:10,350
you know it's money for your retirement

1051
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,323
and you take a really long term view, I think that's key.

1052
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,210
Never investing, you borrow money against your securities?

1053
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:20,940
You know the markets offer you the opportunity

1054
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,370
to leverage your investment

1055
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:26,670
and in most worlds you'll be okay,

1056
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,360
except if there's a financial crisis

1057
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,000
or a nuclear device gets detonated,

1058
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,010
God forbid somewhere in the world,

1059
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,170
or there's a unexpected war

1060
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,050
or someone kills a leader unexpectedly.

1061
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,900
Things happen that can change the course of history

1062
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,290
and markets react very negatively to those kinds of events.

1063
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,880
And you can own the greatest business in the world,

1064
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,050
trading for $100 a share

1065
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,000
and next moment it could be 50.

1066
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,180
So as long as you don't borrow against securities,

1067
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,160
you own really high quality businesses

1068
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,773
and it's not money that you need in the short term,

1069
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,670
then you can actually be thoughtful about it

1070
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,830
and that is a huge advantage.

1071
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,590
The vast majority of investors it seems

1072
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,820
tend to be the ones that panic

1073
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,330
and the downturns get over elated

1074
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,040
when markets are doing well.

1075
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,830
- So be able to think long-term

1076
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,960
and be sufficiently financially secure

1077
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,140
such that you can afford to think long-term.

1078
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,440
- Yeah, Buffett is the ultimate long-term thinker

1079
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,543
and just the decisions he makes,

1080
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,280
the consistency of the decisions he's made over time

1081
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,950
and fitting into that sort of long-term framework

1082
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:38,910
is a very, very educational,

1083
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,510
let's put it that way for learning about this business.

1084
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:45,570
- So you mentioned eight companies,

1085
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,760
but what do you think about mutual funds

1086
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,980
for everyday investors that diversify

1087
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,820
across a larger number of companies?

1088
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,133
- I think there are very few mutual funds.

1089
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,890
There are thousands and thousands of mutual funds.

1090
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,530
There are very few that earn their keep

1091
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,270
in terms of the fees they charge.

1092
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,470
They tend to be too diversified

1093
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,580
and too short term.

1094
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,080
And you're often much better off

1095
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,700
just buying an index fund.

1096
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,263
And many of them perform,

1097
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,170
if you look carefully their portfolios

1098
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:23,100
are not so different from the underlying index itself

1099
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,110
and you tend to pay a much higher fee.

1100
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:26,229
Now, all of that being said,

1101
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,580
there's some very talented mutual fund managers,

1102
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,350
a guy named Will Danoff at Fidelity's

1103
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,082
had a great record over a long period of time.

1104
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:36,420
You know, the famous Peter Lynch, Ron Baron,

1105
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,480
another great long-term growth stock investor.

1106
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,150
So there's some great mutual funds,

1107
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:46,380
but I put them in the handful versus the thousands.

1108
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,490
And if you're in the thousands

1109
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:54,360
I'd rather someone bought just an index fund basically,

1110
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,177
- Yeah, index funds.

1111
00:43:56,177 --> 00:43:59,760
But what would be the leap for an everyday investor

1112
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,700
to go to investing in a small number of companies

1113
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,850
like two, three, four, five companies?

1114
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:08,220
- I even recommend for individual investors

1115
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:11,070
to invest in a dozen companies.

1116
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,690
You don't get that much more benefit

1117
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,690
of diversification going from a dozen to 25 or even 50.

1118
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,800
Most of the benefits diversification

1119
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,293
come in the first, you know, call it 10 or 12.

1120
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,720
And if you're investing in businesses

1121
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,280
that don't have a lot of debt,

1122
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,500
they're businesses that you can understand yourself.

1123
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,420
You understand, you know,

1124
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,250
actually individual investors did a much better job

1125
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:35,940
analyzing Tesla than the so-called professional investors

1126
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,350
or analysts, the vast majority of them.

1127
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:38,300
So if it's a business, you understand

1128
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,500
if you bought a Tesla, you understand the product

1129
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,350
and its appeal to consumers.

1130
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,100
It's a good place to start when you're analyzing a company.

1131
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,470
So I would invest in things you can understand

1132
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,523
that's kind of a key.

1133
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:53,610
You know you like Chipotle,

1134
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,870
you understand why they're successful.

1135
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,310
You can go there every week and you can monitor

1136
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,030
is anything changing?

1137
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,920
You know, how these new kind of,

1138
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,370
how's chicken el pastor is that a good upgrade

1139
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,623
from the basic chicken,

1140
00:45:08,554 --> 00:45:12,390
The drink offerings improving, the store is clean.

1141
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:13,290
I think you should invest

1142
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,580
in companies you really understand.

1143
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,890
Simple businesses where you can predict

1144
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,910
with a high degree of confidence

1145
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:19,050
what it's gonna look like over time.

1146
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,073
And if you do that

1147
00:45:20,073 --> 00:45:22,020
in a not particularly concentrated fashion

1148
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,060
and you don't borrow money against your securities,

1149
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,320
you're probably do much better

1150
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,850
than your typical mutual fund.

1151
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:27,683
- Yeah, it's interesting.

1152
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,490
Consumers that love a thing

1153
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,310
are actually good analysts of that thing,

1154
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,030
or I guess a good starting point.

1155
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:33,863
- And by the way,

1156
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,010
there's much more information available today.

1157
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:37,320
When I was first investing,

1158
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,510
literally we had people faxing us documents

1159
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,060
from the SEC filings in Washington DC.

1160
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,920
Now everything's available online,

1161
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,770
conference call transcripts are free.

1162
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,567
You have AI, you have unlimited data

1163
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:58,080
and all kinds of message boards and Reddit forums

1164
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,750
and things where people are sharing advice.

1165
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,940
And everyone has their own,

1166
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,030
you know, by virtue of their career or experience

1167
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,060
they'll know about an industry or a business

1168
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,893
and that gives them...

1169
00:46:09,893 --> 00:46:12,360
I would take advantage of your own competitive advantages.

1170
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,213
- I'm just afraid if I invest in Chipotle,

1171
00:46:14,213 --> 00:46:17,490
I'll be like analyzing every little change of menu

1172
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,810
from a financial perspective

1173
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,730
and just be very critical.

1174
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,620
- If it's gonna affect your experience

1175
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:24,510
I wouldn't buy the stock.

1176
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,400
- Yeah, I mean I should also say that

1177
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,820
I am somebody that emotionally does respond to volatility,

1178
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,850
which is why I've never bought index funds

1179
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,460
and I just notice myself psychologically

1180
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,740
being affected by the ups and downs of the market.

1181
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,737
I want to tune out because if I'm at all tuned in

1182
00:46:40,737 --> 00:46:43,320
and has a negative impact on my life.

1183
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,570
- Yeah, that's really important.

1184
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,780
- Can you explain what activist investing is?

1185
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,360
You've been talking about investing

1186
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,880
and then looking at companies when they're struggling,

1187
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,780
stepping in and reconfiguring things within that company

1188
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,330
and helping it become great.

1189
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,770
So that's part of it,

1190
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,510
but let's just sum out,

1191
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,760
what's this idea of activist investing?

1192
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,800
- I think recently in the last couple of days

1193
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,000
I read an article saying that

1194
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,730
more than 50% of the capital in the world today

1195
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,680
that's invest in the stock markets,

1196
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,990
passive indexed money.

1197
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,240
And that's the most passive form, right?

1198
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,280
So if you think about an index fund,

1199
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,210
a machine buys a fixed set of securities

1200
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,353
in certain proportion.

1201
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,830
There's no human judgment at all.

1202
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,463
And there's no real person behind it in a way.

1203
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:35,970
They never take steps to improve a business.

1204
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,583
They just quietly own securities.

1205
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,737
What we do is we invest our capital in a handful of things.

1206
00:47:42,737 --> 00:47:44,280
We get to know them really, really well.

1207
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,230
'Cause you're gonna put 20%

1208
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,570
of your assets in something you need to know it really well.

1209
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,570
But once you become a big holder

1210
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,730
and if you've got some thoughts

1211
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,743
on how to make a business more valuable,

1212
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:58,410
you can do more than just be a passive investor.

1213
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,160
So our strategy is built upon

1214
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,120
finding great companies in some cases

1215
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,320
that have lost their way and then helping them succeed.

1216
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,140
And we can do that with ideas from outside the boardroom.

1217
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,380
Sometimes we take a seat on a board

1218
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,373
or more than one,

1219
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,300
and we work with the best management teams in the world

1220
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,550
to help these businesses succeed.

1221
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,410
So when I first went into this business

1222
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,560
no one knew who we were

1223
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:26,940
and we didn't have that much money.

1224
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,003
And so to influence what was to us a big company,

1225
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,600
we had to make a fair bit more noise, right?

1226
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,160
So we would buy a stake,

1227
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,810
we'd announced it publicly,

1228
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,370
we'd attempt to engage with management.

1229
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,720
The first activist investment we made

1230
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,820
at Persian Square was Wendy's.

1231
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,023
I couldn't get the CEO to ever return my call.

1232
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:46,500
He didn't even return my call.

1233
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,710
So we actually, in that case,

1234
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,870
our idea was Wendy's owned a company called Tim Horton's,

1235
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:54,060
which was this coffee donut chain.

1236
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:57,640
And you could buy Wendy's for basically $5 billion

1237
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,810
and they owned a hundred percent of Tim Horton's,

1238
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,150
which itself was worth more than 5 billion.

1239
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,770
So you could literally buy Wendy's,

1240
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,770
separate Tim Horton's and get Wendy's for negative value.

1241
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,450
That seemed like a pretty good opportunity

1242
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:12,000
even though the business wasn't doing that well.

1243
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,970
So we bought the stake called the CEO,

1244
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,410
couldn't get a meeting, nothing.

1245
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:18,150
So we hired actually Blackstone,

1246
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:21,450
which was at that time an investment bank.

1247
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:24,210
And we hired them to do what's called a fairness opinion

1248
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,380
of what Wendy's would be worth

1249
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,580
if they followed our advice

1250
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,580
and they agreed to do it, paid 'em a fee for it.

1251
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,930
And then we mailed in a letter

1252
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:32,130
with a copy of the fairness opinion

1253
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:33,503
saying Wendy's would basically be worth 80% more

1254
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:35,310
if they did what we said.

1255
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,260
And six weeks later they did what we said.

1256
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,100
So that's activism, at least an early form of activism.

1257
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,810
With that kind of under our belt,

1258
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,190
we had a little more credibility

1259
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,450
and now we started to take things

1260
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,863
and stakes in companies.

1261
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,990
The media would pay attention.

1262
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,840
So the media became a kind of an important partner

1263
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,810
and some combination of shame, embarrassment

1264
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:56,910
and opportunity motivated

1265
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,470
management teams to do the right thing.

1266
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:00,190
And then beyond that

1267
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,910
there's certain steps you can take

1268
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,350
if management's recalcitrant

1269
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:05,730
and the shareholders are on your side.

1270
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:08,040
But it's a bit like running for office.

1271
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,420
You've gotta get all the constituents

1272
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,820
to support you and your ideas.

1273
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,530
And if they support you and your ideas,

1274
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:16,980
you can overthrow, if you will, the board of a company.

1275
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,660
You bring in new talent

1276
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,510
and then take over the management of a business.

1277
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,730
And that's the most extreme form of activism.

1278
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,440
So that's kind of the early days.

1279
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,330
And what we did, and a lot of the early things

1280
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,570
that we did were

1281
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,630
we call it sort of like investment banking activism

1282
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,160
where we'd go in and recommend something,

1283
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,350
a good investment bank would've recommended.

1284
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,670
And if they do it, we make a bunch of money

1285
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,890
and then we moved on to the next one.

1286
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:42,990
And then we realized an investment,

1287
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,090
a company called General Growth

1288
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,340
was the first time we took a board seat on a company.

1289
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:50,790
And there it was some financial restructuring

1290
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,530
and also an opportunity to improve the operations

1291
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,900
of the business, sit on the board of a company.

1292
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,360
And that was one of the best investments we ever made.

1293
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,010
And we said, okay, we can do more

1294
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,500
than just be an outside the boardroom investor

1295
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,210
and we can get involved in

1296
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,010
helping select the right management teams

1297
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,900
and helping guide the right management teams.

1298
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,900
And then we've done that over years.

1299
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,210
And then I would say the last seven years

1300
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:14,310
we haven't had to be an activist.

1301
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:15,510
An activist is generally someone

1302
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,450
who's outside banging on the door, trying to get in.

1303
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,130
We've sort of built enough credibility

1304
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,690
that they open the door

1305
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:24,337
and they say, "Hey Bill, what ideas do you have?

1306
00:51:24,337 --> 00:51:27,090
"So welcome. Would you like to join the board?"

1307
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,200
We're treated differently today

1308
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,880
than we were in the beginning.

1309
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,953
And that is,

1310
00:51:32,953 --> 00:51:34,860
I would say some people might just call it

1311
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,110
being an engaged owner.

1312
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:37,943
And that by the way,

1313
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:41,160
that's the way investing was done in the Andrew Carnegie,

1314
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,000
JP Morgan days, 150 years ago, right?

1315
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,550
You had these iconic business leaders

1316
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,380
that would own 20% of US steel,

1317
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,090
and when things would go wrong,

1318
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:53,760
they'd replaced the board and the management and fix them.

1319
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,390
And over time we went to a world where mutual funds

1320
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,080
were created like in the 1920s, '30s,

1321
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,350
index funds with Vanguard and others.

1322
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,930
And that all these controlling shareholders

1323
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,600
would kind of gave their stock to society

1324
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,940
or their children and multiple generations

1325
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,530
and there were no longer kind of controlling

1326
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,690
owners of businesses were very few.

1327
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,490
And that led to underperformance

1328
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:19,440
and the opportunity for activists over time.

1329
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,637
And what activism has done,

1330
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,950
and I think we've helped lead this movement,

1331
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:25,140
is it restored kind of the balance of power

1332
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,000
between the owners of the business

1333
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,440
and the managements of the company.

1334
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,140
And that's been a very good thing for the performance

1335
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,600
of the US stock market actually.

1336
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,370
- So the owners meaning the shareholders?

1337
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,203
- [Bill] Yes.

1338
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:39,690
- And so there's a more direct channel of communication

1339
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,660
with activists investing between the shareholders

1340
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,190
and the people running the company.

1341
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,400
- Yes. So activists generally never own more than

1342
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,140
five or 10% of a business.

1343
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,210
So they don't have control.

1344
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,100
So the way they get influence

1345
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,410
is they have to convince the other

1346
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,500
but they have to get to sort of a majority

1347
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,210
of the other shareholders to support them.

1348
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,070
And if they can get that kind of support,

1349
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,860
they can behave almost like a controlling shareholder,

1350
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:06,210
and that's how it works.

1351
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,580
- So the running of a company's

1352
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,670
according to Bill Ackman is more democratic now?

1353
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,200
- It is, it is.

1354
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,400
But you need some thought leaders.

1355
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,350
So activists are kind of thought leaders

1356
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,350
'cause they can spend the time and the money.

1357
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,720
You know, a retail investor that owns a thousand shares

1358
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,710
doesn't have the resources or the time, they got a day job.

1359
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,880
Whereas an activist day job

1360
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,680
is finding the handful of things

1361
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,570
where there are opportunities.

1362
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:34,920
- So on average, is it good to have such an engaged,

1363
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,000
powerful, influential investor

1364
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,153
helping control the direction of a company?

1365
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,880
- It depends who that investor is,

1366
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,830
but generally I think it's a good thing.

1367
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,220
And that's why one of the problems

1368
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,360
with being CEO of a company today

1369
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,940
and having a very diversified shareholder base

1370
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,690
is the kind of short term, long term balance.

1371
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,090
And you have investors who have all different interests

1372
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,320
in terms of what they want achieve

1373
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,210
and when they wanted it achieved.

1374
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,570
And CEO of a new company hasn't had...

1375
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,030
A new CEO of an old company, let's say,

1376
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,910
hasn't had the chance to develop the credibility

1377
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,760
to make the kinda longer term decisions

1378
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,040
and can be stuck in a cycle

1379
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,680
of being judged on a quarterly basis.

1380
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,880
And a business, the best businesses are forever assets

1381
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,100
and decisions you make now have impact three,

1382
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,500
four or five years from now.

1383
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,390
And sometimes there are decisions we make

1384
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,000
that have the effect of reducing

1385
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,010
the earnings of a company in the short term

1386
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,360
because in the long term

1387
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,910
it's gonna make the business much more valuable.

1388
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,140
But it's sometimes it's hard

1389
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,130
to have that kind of credibility

1390
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,540
when you're a new CEO of a company.

1391
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,930
So when you have a major owner that's respected

1392
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,240
by other shareholders sitting on the board saying,

1393
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,130
hey, the CEO's doing the right thing

1394
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,280
and making this expensive investment in a new factory,

1395
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,590
we're spending more money on R&D

1396
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,790
because we're developing something

1397
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,710
that's gonna pay off over time.

1398
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:01,350
That large owner on the board

1399
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:03,630
can help buy the time necessary

1400
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,700
for management to behave in a longer term way.

1401
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,560
And that's, I think, good for all the shareholders.

1402
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,670
- So that's the good story.

1403
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,350
But can it get bad?

1404
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,980
Can you have a CEO who is a visionary

1405
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,650
and sees the long-term future of a company

1406
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:18,120
and an investor come in

1407
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,550
and have very selfish interest

1408
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,950
in just making more money in the short term

1409
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,750
and therefore destroy

1410
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,860
and manipulate the opinions of the shareholders

1411
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:33,063
and other people on the board in order to sink the company,

1412
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:37,620
maybe increase the price,

1413
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,800
but destroy the possibility of long-term value?

1414
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,510
- It could theoretically happen,

1415
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,260
but again, the activist in your example,

1416
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,300
generally doesn't own a lot of stock.

1417
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,860
The shareholder bases today,

1418
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,690
the biggest shareholders are these index funds

1419
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,130
that are forever, right?

1420
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,620
The BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street,

1421
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,390
their ownership stakes are just at this point

1422
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,370
only growing 'cause of the inflows of capital

1423
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,110
they have from shareholders.

1424
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,080
So they have to think or they should think very long term

1425
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,550
and they're gonna be very skeptical

1426
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,819
of someone coming in with a short term idea

1427
00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:10,140
that drives the stock price up

1428
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,790
in the next six months.

1429
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,860
But impairs the company's long-term ability to compete.

1430
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,090
And basically that ownership group

1431
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:19,830
prevents this kind of activity from really happening.

1432
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:22,950
- So people are generally skeptical,

1433
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,710
short-term activist investors?

1434
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,200
- Yes, and they're very few.

1435
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,110
I don't really know any short-term activist investors.

1436
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:32,853
Not ones with credibility.

1437
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,610
- You mentioned General Growth.

1438
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,770
I read somewhere called arguably

1439
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,833
one of the best hedge fund trades of all time.

1440
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:47,270
So I guess it went from $60 million to over 3 billion.

1441
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,797
- It was a good one.

1442
00:56:48,797 --> 00:56:50,580
But it wasn't a trade,

1443
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,600
I wouldn't describe it as a trade.

1444
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,880
A trade is something you buy and you flip.

1445
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,920
This is something where we made the investment initially

1446
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,920
in November of 2008,

1447
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,530
and then we still own a company

1448
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:02,880
we spun off of General Growth

1449
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,280
and it's now 15 years later.

1450
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,520
- Can you describe what went into making that decision

1451
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,800
to actually increasing the value of the company?

1452
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,780
- Sure. So this was at the time of the financial crisis

1453
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,040
circa November, 2008.

1454
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,710
What real estate's always been a kind of sector

1455
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,610
that I've been interested in.

1456
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,290
I began my career in the real estate business

1457
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:24,390
working for my dad actually

1458
00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,207
ranging mortgages for real estate developers.

1459
00:57:27,207 --> 00:57:29,550
So I have kind of deep ties

1460
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,840
and interest in the business

1461
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,400
and General Growth was the second largest

1462
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,320
shopping mall company in the country.

1463
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,420
Simon Properties, many people have heard of,

1464
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,070
General Growth was number two.

1465
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:39,900
They owned some of the best malls in the country.

1466
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,570
And at that time people thought of shopping malls

1467
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:45,090
as these non-disruptively things.

1468
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,320
Again, we talk about disruption.

1469
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,270
Malls have been disrupted in many ways.

1470
00:57:52,085 --> 00:57:53,367
And General Growth, the company,

1471
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:56,100
the CFO in particular was very aggressive

1472
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,050
in the way that he borrowed money,

1473
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:01,110
and he borrowed money from a kind of Wall Street,

1474
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,780
not long-term mortgages

1475
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,640
but generally relatively short-term mortgages.

1476
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,770
It was pretty aggressive as the value went up,

1477
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,750
he would borrow more and more against the assets

1478
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,780
and that helped the short-term results of the business.

1479
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,940
The problem was during the financial crisis,

1480
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:18,390
the market for what's called CMBS,

1481
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,970
commercial mortgage backed securities basically shut

1482
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:23,040
and the company 'cause its debt was relatively short term,

1483
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,230
had a lot of big maturities coming up

1484
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,330
that they had no ability to refinance.

1485
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,950
And the market said, oh my god,

1486
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,810
the lenders are gonna foreclose

1487
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:32,340
and the shareholders are gonna get wiped.

1488
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,210
The company's gonna go bankrupt,

1489
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,110
they're gonna get wiped out.

1490
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:38,230
The stock went from $63 a share to 34 cents.

1491
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,860
There was a family, the bucks bound family owned

1492
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,780
I think about 25% of the company

1493
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,020
and they had 5 billion of stock

1494
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,570
that was worth 25 million or something by the time

1495
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:50,520
we bought a stake in the business.

1496
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,080
And what interested me was

1497
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:56,010
I thought the assets were worth

1498
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,630
substantially more than the liabilities.

1499
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:59,970
The company had 27 billion of debt

1500
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,910
and had a hundred million dollars value

1501
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,910
of the equity down from like 20 billion.

1502
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:06,960
And one that, you know,

1503
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,440
sort of an interesting place to start with a stock down 99%.

1504
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,790
But the fundamental drivers,

1505
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,010
the mall business are occupancy.

1506
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:15,210
How occupied are the malls.

1507
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:18,360
Occupancy was up year on year between '07 and '08.

1508
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,610
Interestingly, net operating income,

1509
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,530
which is kind of of a measure of cash flow from the malls,

1510
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,480
that was up year on year.

1511
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,560
So kind of the underlying fundamentals were doing fine.

1512
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,120
The only problem they had is they had

1513
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,860
billions of dollars of debt that they had to repay,

1514
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,510
they couldn't repay.

1515
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:36,250
And if you kind of examine the bankruptcy code

1516
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:41,040
that it's precisely designed for a situation like this

1517
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,070
where it's kind of this resting place you can go

1518
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,570
to kind of restructure your business.

1519
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,240
Now the problem was that every other company

1520
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,480
that had gone bankrupt, the shareholders got wiped out.

1521
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,580
And so the market's seeing every previous example,

1522
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,630
the shareholders get wiped out

1523
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,730
the assumptions is this stocks gonna go to zero.

1524
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,440
But that's not what the bankruptcy code says.

1525
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,510
What the bankruptcy code says is that

1526
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,740
the value gets apportioned based on value.

1527
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,360
And if you could prove to a judge

1528
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,360
that there was the assets worth more than the liabilities,

1529
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,100
then the shareholders actually get to keep

1530
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,080
their investment in the company.

1531
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,730
And that was the bet we made.

1532
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,047
And so we stepped into the market

1533
01:00:19,047 --> 01:00:19,880
and we bought 25% of the company in the open market.

1534
01:00:22,765 --> 01:00:23,598
We had to pay up.

1535
01:00:23,598 --> 01:00:25,290
It started out at 34 cents,

1536
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,350
I think there were 300 million shares.

1537
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,567
So it was at a hundred million dollars value.

1538
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,840
By the time we were done

1539
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,520
we paid an average of,

1540
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,650
we paid 60 million for 25% of the business.

1541
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:38,760
So about $240 million for the equity of the company.

1542
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,750
And then we had to get on the board

1543
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,460
to convince the directors the right thing to do.

1544
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,770
And the board was in complete panic,

1545
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,030
didn't know what to do,

1546
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:46,830
spending a ton of money on advisors.

1547
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,140
And you know, I was a shareholder activist,

1548
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,020
four years into Pershing Square

1549
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,850
and no one had any idea what we were doing.

1550
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,740
They thought we were crazy every day stock.

1551
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,910
Every day we'd go into the market

1552
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,890
and we'd buy this penny stock

1553
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,510
and we'd file what's called a 13 D,

1554
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:06,270
every 1% increase in our stake.

1555
01:01:06,270 --> 01:01:07,530
And people just thought we were crazy.

1556
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,600
We're buying stock in a company that's gonna go bankrupt.

1557
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,783
Bill, you're gonna lose all your money, you know, run.

1558
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,230
And I said, well wait, you know, bankruptcy code says

1559
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:18,900
that it was more asset value than liabilities.

1560
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,430
We should be fine.

1561
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,970
And the key moment if you're looking for fun moments

1562
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:26,460
is there's a woman named Maddie Buxbaum

1563
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,930
who was from the Bucksbaum family

1564
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,040
and her cousin John was chairman of the board,

1565
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,720
CEO of the company.

1566
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,970
And I said, as she calls me

1567
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:37,650
after we disclose our stake in the company,

1568
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,837
she's like, "Billy Ackman, I'm really glad to see you here".

1569
01:01:39,837 --> 01:01:42,660
And I met her like, I don't think it was a date,

1570
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,760
but I kind of met her in a social context

1571
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,830
when I was like 25 or something.

1572
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,479
And she said, "Look, I'm really glad to see you here

1573
01:01:48,479 --> 01:01:52,200
"and if there's anything I can do to help you call me".

1574
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,253
I said sure.

1575
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,100
We kept trying to get on the board of the company,

1576
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:57,720
they wouldn't invite us on,

1577
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,605
couldn't really run a proxy contest

1578
01:01:59,605 --> 01:02:01,920
not with a company going bankrupt.

1579
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,750
And their advisors actually were Goldman Sachs

1580
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,600
and they're like, you don't want the fox in the hen house.

1581
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:08,550
And they were listening to their advisors.

1582
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,050
So I called Maddie up

1583
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,497
and I said, "Maddie, I need to get on the board

1584
01:02:11,497 --> 01:02:12,660
"of the company to help".

1585
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,617
And she says, "You know what, I will call my cousin

1586
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:16,137
"and I'll get it done".

1587
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:20,520
Like, you know, she calls back a few hours later,

1588
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,690
you'll be going onto the board.

1589
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,340
I don't know what she said to the cousin.

1590
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:25,560
- Well, she was convincing.

1591
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,056
- Next thing you know, I'm invited to on the board

1592
01:02:27,056 --> 01:02:29,350
of the company and the board is talking about

1593
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,430
the old equity of General Growth.

1594
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:33,900
Old equity is what you talk about

1595
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,010
the shareholders are getting wiped out.

1596
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:37,770
I said, no, no, no, this board represents

1597
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:40,230
the current equity of the company

1598
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,370
and I'm a major shareholder.

1599
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:42,570
John's a major shareholder.

1600
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:43,800
There's plenty of asset value here.

1601
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,870
This company should be able to be restructured

1602
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,820
for the benefit of shareholders.

1603
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,400
And we led a restructuring for the benefit of shareholders

1604
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,840
and it took, let's say eight months

1605
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,790
and the company emerged from chapter 11.

1606
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,940
We made an incremental investment into the company

1607
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,320
and the shareholders kept

1608
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,180
the vast majority of their investment.

1609
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,570
All the creditors got their face amount of their investment

1610
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:09,180
par plus accruede interest.

1611
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:10,770
And it was a great outcome.

1612
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,150
All the employees kept their jobs.

1613
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,910
The mall stayed open, there's no liquidation.

1614
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,260
The bankruptcy system worked the way it should.

1615
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,070
You know, I was in court all the time.

1616
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,830
And the first meeting with the judge,

1617
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:23,663
the judge was like,

1618
01:03:23,663 --> 01:03:24,496
"Look, this would never have happened

1619
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:26,760
"were it not for a financial crisis".

1620
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,430
And once the judge said that I knew we were gonna be fine

1621
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,020
because the company really not done

1622
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,190
anything fundamentally wrong,

1623
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,800
maybe a little too aggressive in how they borrowed money.

1624
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,073
And stock went from 34 cents to $31 a share.

1625
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,460
And actually fun little anecdote,

1626
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:42,293
we made a lot of people

1627
01:03:42,293 --> 01:03:44,820
a lot of money who followed us into it.

1628
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,470
I got a lot of nice thank you notes,

1629
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:47,910
which you get on occasion in this business,

1630
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:49,110
believe it or not.

1631
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,400
And then one day I get a voicemail,

1632
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,950
this is when there was something called voicemail

1633
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:55,350
probably a few years later.

1634
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:58,150
And it's a guy with a very thick Jamaican accent

1635
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,320
leaving a message for Bill Ackman.

1636
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:02,940
So you know, I return all my calls.

1637
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:04,807
Call the guy back, I said,

1638
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:07,140
"Hi, it's Bill Ackman, I'm just returning your call".

1639
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:11,277
He says, "Oh Mr. Ackman, thank you so much for calling me".

1640
01:04:11,277 --> 01:04:13,710
And I said, "Oh, how can I help?"

1641
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,953
He says, "I wanted to thank you".

1642
01:04:14,953 --> 01:04:16,606
I said, "What do you mean?"

1643
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:19,417
He said, "I saw you on CNBC a couple years ago

1644
01:04:19,417 --> 01:04:20,250
"and you were talking about

1645
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,320
"this General Growth and the stock".

1646
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,430
I said, "Where was the stock at the time?"

1647
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,353
He said, "It's 60 cents or something like this.

1648
01:04:25,353 --> 01:04:27,237
"And I bought a lot of stock".

1649
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:31,147
And I'm like, "Well how much did you invest?"

1650
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:35,160
"Oh, I invest all of my money in the company".

1651
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,130
And he was a New York City taxi driver

1652
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,260
and he invested like $50,000

1653
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:44,100
or something like this at 60 cents a share.

1654
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:44,933
And he was still holding it.

1655
01:04:44,933 --> 01:04:46,500
And he went into retirement

1656
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:49,200
and he made, you know, 50 times as money.

1657
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,570
And you know, those are the moments

1658
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,850
that you feel pretty good about investing.

1659
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,260
- What gave you confidence through that.

1660
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:57,210
Went to penny stock and I'm sure

1661
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:58,590
you were getting a lot of naysayers

1662
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:01,380
and people saying that this is crazy.

1663
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:03,270
- It's the same thing. You just do the work.

1664
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,550
Like we got a lot of pushback from our investors actually.

1665
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:08,490
'Cause we had never invested in a bankrupt company before.

1666
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:10,890
It's a field called distressed investing

1667
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:14,220
and they're dedicated distressed investors

1668
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,200
and we weren't considered one of them.

1669
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,430
So Bill, what are are you doing?

1670
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:18,930
You don't know anything about distressed investing.

1671
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,053
You don't know anything about bankruptcy investing.

1672
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:23,790
But I can read.

1673
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:24,647
- And you learned.

1674
01:05:24,647 --> 01:05:27,930
- And I learned and it sometimes it's very helpful

1675
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:31,230
not to be a practitioner, an expert in something,

1676
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:33,210
'cause you get used to the conventional wisdom.

1677
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,330
And so we just, you know, abstractly read

1678
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:38,610
the step back and looked at the facts

1679
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,560
and it was just a really interesting setup

1680
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,440
for one of the best investments we ever made.

1681
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,260
- How hard is it to learn some of the legal aspects of this?

1682
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,660
Like you mentioned bankruptcy code.

1683
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:52,530
Like I imagine is very sort of dense language

1684
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,350
and dense ideas and the loopholes

1685
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:56,520
and all that kind of stuff.

1686
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,200
Like if you're just stepping in

1687
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,090
and you've never done distressed investing,

1688
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:01,560
how hard is it to figure out?

1689
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,610
- It's not that hard.

1690
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:05,379
No, it's not that hard.

1691
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:08,130
I mean, I literally read a book on distressed investing.

1692
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,690
Ben Branch or something,

1693
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:10,950
something on distressed investing.

1694
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:13,530
- So you were able to pick up the intuition from that.

1695
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:17,010
Just all the basic skills involved,

1696
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,380
the basic facts to know all that kind of stuff.

1697
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:21,090
- Most of the world's knowledge

1698
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:22,740
is already been written somewhere.

1699
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,570
You just gotta read the right books.

1700
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,603
And also had great lawyers,

1701
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:30,720
built up some great relationships.

1702
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,940
We worked with Sullivan and Cromwell

1703
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,070
and the lawyer there named Joe Schenker,

1704
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,420
who I met earlier in my career.

1705
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,890
Pershing Score is actually my second act

1706
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:38,723
in the hedge fund business.

1707
01:06:38,723 --> 01:06:41,850
I started a fund called Gotham Partners when I was 26.

1708
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:42,750
One of my early investments

1709
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,030
was a company called Rockefeller Center Properties

1710
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,920
that was heading for bankruptcy.

1711
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,470
And the lawyer on the other side representing Goldman Sachs

1712
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,150
was a guy named Joe Schenker.

1713
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:52,770
So he was like an obvious phone call

1714
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:54,660
'cause we had yet another real estate bankruptcy.

1715
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,970
And that one we did very well.

1716
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,530
But I missed the big opportunity

1717
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:02,970
and I suffered severe psychological torture

1718
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:04,320
every time I walked by Rockefeller Center

1719
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,153
because we could've made,

1720
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:06,690
we knew more about that property than anyone else,

1721
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,460
but I knew less about deal making

1722
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,630
and didn't have the resources.

1723
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:12,153
And I was 28 years old or 27,

1724
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:15,780
and they hired a better lawyer than we did

1725
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,440
and they outsmarted us on that one in a way.

1726
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,000
So I said, okay, I'm gonna go hire this guy

1727
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,050
the next time around.

1728
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:26,190
- Okay, we'll probably talk about Rockefeller Center

1729
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,140
and some failures,

1730
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,470
but first you said Fox in the henhouse.

1731
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:32,760
Something that the board

1732
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,500
and the chairman were worried about.

1733
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,930
Why would they call you a fox?

1734
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:40,920
So you keep saying activist investing is,

1735
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,030
there's nothing to worry about.

1736
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,940
It's always good, mostly good.

1737
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:49,200
But you know, that expression applied in this context,

1738
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,375
they were still worried about that.

1739
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:54,207
And so, I mean, there's a million questions here,

1740
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:55,890
but first of all, what is the process

1741
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:58,410
of getting on the board look like?

1742
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:01,350
- So a board can always admit a member at any time

1743
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:03,640
in their discretion for a US company

1744
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:07,200
that maybe there's some jurisdiction

1745
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:08,130
where you need a shareholder vote.

1746
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,480
But in most cases a board can vote on

1747
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:11,580
any director that they want.

1748
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:14,370
If the board doesn't invite you to the party,

1749
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:17,010
you have to apply to be a member in effect.

1750
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,590
And that process is called,

1751
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:21,240
basically it's the process

1752
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:25,710
of ultimately running a slate for a meeting

1753
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,180
where you propose a number.

1754
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,890
Any shareholder can propose

1755
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:29,880
to be on a board of a company

1756
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,090
if they own a one share of stock in the business.

1757
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:36,573
And getting your name in the company's,

1758
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,660
you know, in the materials they sent to shareholders

1759
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,359
those rules were written in a way that were very unfavorable

1760
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:43,439
and very difficult to get in the door.

1761
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,020
And those rules have been changed very recently

1762
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,390
where the company now has to include a candidate,

1763
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,160
really all the candidates

1764
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,350
and the materials they sent to shareholders,

1765
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:53,100
so the shareholders pick the best ones.

1766
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,540
When we applied or when we applied,

1767
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,069
when we ran proxy contests in the past

1768
01:08:56,069 --> 01:08:57,420
that was not the case.

1769
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:58,979
And so you have to spend a lot of money,

1770
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:01,890
mostly mailing fees and all kinds of other legal

1771
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:04,500
and other expenses to let everyone know you're running,

1772
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,970
like running a political campaign.

1773
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:06,803
And then you gotta run around

1774
01:09:06,803 --> 01:09:08,640
and meet with the big shareholders,

1775
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,620
you know, fly around the country,

1776
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:11,729
explain your case to them,

1777
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:14,700
and then there's a shareholder meeting.

1778
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,200
And if you get a majority of the votes you get on.

1779
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:22,510
- What's this proxy contest/battle idea?

1780
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:23,343
What's--

1781
01:09:23,343 --> 01:09:25,260
- The battle comes when they don't want you to get on.

1782
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:28,890
And a lot of that has to do with, I would say pride,

1783
01:09:28,890 --> 01:09:29,723
normal human kind of stuff.

1784
01:09:29,723 --> 01:09:32,550
You know, a lot of times a board

1785
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:35,040
of an underperforming company doesn't wanna admit

1786
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,960
that they've underperformed

1787
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,880
and boards of directors,

1788
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,950
20 years ago when we started Pershing Square,

1789
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:42,870
were pretty cushy jobs.

1790
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,819
Sit on a board of a company,

1791
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:48,149
you play golf with a CEO at nice golf courses,

1792
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:49,500
you make a few hundred thousand dollars a year

1793
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,649
to go to four meetings.

1794
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,350
It was kind of a rubber stamp world where boards, you know,

1795
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:59,973
at the end of the day the CEO really ran the show.

1796
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,800
Once shareholders could actually dislodge board members

1797
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,780
and they could lose their seats,

1798
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:09,210
and that's really the rise of shareholder activism.

1799
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,340
Boards started taking their responsibilities

1800
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,330
much more seriously,

1801
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,920
because directors are typically,

1802
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:17,580
you know, there are many cases they're retired CEOs,

1803
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,380
this is kind of how they're making a living

1804
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,430
in the later part of their career.

1805
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:21,450
They'll sit on four boards,

1806
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:24,510
they collect a million half dollars a year

1807
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:25,830
in director's fees

1808
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:28,500
if they get thrown off the board by the shareholders,

1809
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,570
that's embarrassing, obviously

1810
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:32,730
and it affects their ability to get on other boards.

1811
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:36,060
So again, incentives, as I said earlier,

1812
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,170
drive all human behavior.

1813
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,700
The incentives directors,

1814
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,600
they wanna preserve their board seats.

1815
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,100
Now the directors on board serve in various roles.

1816
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:46,170
The most vulnerable ones are ones who, for example,

1817
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,850
chair a compensation committee.

1818
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:49,110
And if they put in a bad plan

1819
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:50,580
or they overpaid management,

1820
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,550
they're subject to attack by shareholders.

1821
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:55,440
But you know, these contests are not dissimilar

1822
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:56,790
to political contests.

1823
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:57,900
Whereas Mudslinging

1824
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,687
and other side puts out false information about you

1825
01:11:00,687 --> 01:11:02,250
and you have to respond and they're

1826
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,690
spending the shareholders' money.

1827
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:05,400
So they have sort of unlimited resources.

1828
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:06,600
And you're spending your

1829
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,460
and your investors' money, you know,

1830
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,620
when you're a small firm, finite resources.

1831
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:13,683
So they can outspend you, they can sue you, they can try to,

1832
01:11:14,844 --> 01:11:18,870
you know, jigger the mechanics in such a way

1833
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:19,950
that you're gonna lose,

1834
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,740
there's some unfortunate stuff that's happened in the past,

1835
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:24,320
you know manipulative stuff.

1836
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,070
- So also some stuff that's public,

1837
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,840
like in the press and all this kind of stuff.

1838
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,150
- Oh, of course. You know, there'll be articles about

1839
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,980
the dirty days where they would go

1840
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:38,250
through your trash and make sure that

1841
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,397
you're not sleeping around and things like this.

1842
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:42,333
But that's okay.

1843
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,010
I'm subject, I can survive extreme scrutiny

1844
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,930
'cause I've been through this for a long time.

1845
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:49,920
- So you're saying the fat

1846
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,920
and happy hens can get very wolf like

1847
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,350
when the fox is trying to break in,

1848
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,020
is this how do we extend this metaphor?

1849
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:01,673
- Well, the fox is a threat to the hens.

1850
01:12:03,495 --> 01:12:06,630
- Yeah. But the charismatic fox

1851
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,310
just explain to me why the fox

1852
01:12:08,310 --> 01:12:10,710
is good for everybody in the henhouse.

1853
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:11,543
- At the end of the day,

1854
01:12:11,543 --> 01:12:13,890
it's actually very good on a board to have someone,

1855
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:16,980
you know, there are many examples over time

1856
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,630
and some handful of high profile ones

1857
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:20,070
where the board fought tooth and nail

1858
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,990
to keep the activists off the board.

1859
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:23,280
And then once the activists got on the board

1860
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:25,140
and they said the guy's not so bad after all

1861
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,730
the shareholders voted them on,

1862
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:28,140
it's got some decent ideas

1863
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,325
and let's all work together to have this work out.

1864
01:12:30,325 --> 01:12:31,560
And so there are very few cases

1865
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,273
where after the contest,

1866
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,513
and by the way, sometimes

1867
01:12:35,513 --> 01:12:36,510
you have to replace the entire board.

1868
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:37,343
We've done that.

1869
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,730
But in most cases you got a couple of seats on the board

1870
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:45,240
and it's just you wanna build a board

1871
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:48,060
comprised of diverse points of view.

1872
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,010
And that's how you get to the truth.

1873
01:12:50,010 --> 01:12:54,000
- What was the most dramatic battle for the board

1874
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,800
that you have been a part of?

1875
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,410
- The Canadian Pacific Proxy contest.

1876
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:00,390
So Canadian Pacific was like considered

1877
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:02,610
the most iconic company in Canada.

1878
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:05,100
It literally built the country

1879
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,670
because the rail that got built over Canada

1880
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,583
is what united the various provinces into a country.

1881
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:14,147
And then over time,

1882
01:13:14,147 --> 01:13:16,830
'cause the railroad business is pretty good business,

1883
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,150
they built a ton of hotels,

1884
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:19,440
they owned a lot of real estate

1885
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,540
and it became this massive conglomerate,

1886
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:25,320
but it was horribly mismanaged for decades.

1887
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,760
By the time we got involved,

1888
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,850
it was by far the worst run railroad in North America.

1889
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,590
They had the lowest profit margins,

1890
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,363
they had the lowest growth rate.

1891
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:36,990
The every quarter management would make excuses generally

1892
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:39,270
about the weather as to why they underperform versus,

1893
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:40,920
and there there's a direct competitor,

1894
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,420
a company called Canadian National

1895
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,250
has a rail goes right across the country

1896
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:45,600
and Canadian Pacific would constantly

1897
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,343
be complaining about the weather.

1898
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:51,720
And basically same country, same regions,

1899
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,220
tracks weren't that far apart.

1900
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:57,750
But it was a really important company

1901
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,060
and being on this board was like an honorary thing.

1902
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,490
And everyone on the board was an icon of Canada,

1903
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,410
the chairman of the Royal Bank of Canada,

1904
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,810
the head of the most important grain,

1905
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,220
privately held grain company.

1906
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:10,960
The sort of an important collection of

1907
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:14,880
big time Canadian executives.

1908
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,620
Here we were, you know, this is probably about 13 years ago

1909
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:24,620
and still maybe 44-year-old from New York, not a Canadian

1910
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,280
basically saying this is the worst run

1911
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,110
railroad in North America.

1912
01:14:31,110 --> 01:14:34,650
And we bought 12% of the railroad at a really low price.

1913
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:38,700
And we brought with us to our first meeting

1914
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,680
the greatest railroader ever,

1915
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:41,670
a guy named Hunter Harrison

1916
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:43,670
who had turned around Canadian national.

1917
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:46,230
So we'd like, okay, we've got a great asset,

1918
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:47,970
we've got the greatest railroad CEO of all time.

1919
01:14:47,970 --> 01:14:51,660
He's come outta retirement to step in and run the railroad.

1920
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,310
And we brought him to the first meeting

1921
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:55,290
and they wouldn't even meet with him.

1922
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,240
And they wouldn't certainly

1923
01:14:57,240 --> 01:14:59,280
weren't gonna consider hiring him

1924
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,230
and that led us to a proxy contest.

1925
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:06,230
- And this is where the engine starts churning

1926
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:09,120
to figure out how this contest can be won.

1927
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,550
So what's involved in a--

1928
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:13,650
- Well the key is we had to one, come up with a group

1929
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:17,640
of directors who would be willing to step into a battle.

1930
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,430
And we didn't want a bunch of New York directors

1931
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:22,800
or even American directors, we wanted Canadians.

1932
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,560
The problem was this was the most iconic company in Canada,

1933
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,300
and we wanted high profile people.

1934
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,400
So we talked to all the high profile people in Canada.

1935
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,233
Every one of them would say,

1936
01:15:30,233 --> 01:15:31,500
Bill, you're entirely right.

1937
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,650
This thing is the worst run railroad, it needs to be fixed.

1938
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,660
But you know, I see John at the club,

1939
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,927
I see him at the Toronto Club,

1940
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:41,193
I can't do this, but you're totally right.

1941
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:44,980
And we had to, and that was the concern

1942
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:47,640
you have to file your materials by a certain day,

1943
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,900
you gotta put together a slate.

1944
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,190
We needed a big slate 'cause we knew

1945
01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:53,370
that we had to replace basically all the directors.

1946
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:56,190
And then one, I spoke to a guy

1947
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:58,620
who was one of the wealthiest guys in Canada

1948
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,500
who was on the board at one point in time.

1949
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:05,010
And he said, "Bill, I have an idea for you.

1950
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:07,597
"There's this woman, Rebecca McDonald's,

1951
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,360
"why don't you give her a call?"

1952
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:13,500
And I called Rebecca and she was the first woman

1953
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,350
to take a company public in Canada as CEO.

1954
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:18,990
And she was a kind of anti-establishment,

1955
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,660
not afraid to take on anything kind of person.

1956
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,090
And I called her, we had a great conversation

1957
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:27,390
and she was in the Dominican Republic at her house.

1958
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:31,050
And I flew down to see her and she said, "Yeah, I'm all in".

1959
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,450
And actually, once we got her,

1960
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:35,040
that enabled us to get others.

1961
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,050
And then we put together our slate

1962
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:39,120
and we had some pretty

1963
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,890
interesting dialogue with the company.

1964
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,810
They tried to embarrass us all the time.

1965
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,440
- In the press publicly, what are we talking about?

1966
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,990
- Press publicly.

1967
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:48,090
You know, at one point I wrote an email saying,

1968
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,583
look, let's come to peace on this thing,

1969
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,690
but if we don't you're really forcing my hand

1970
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,570
and we're gonna have to rent the largest hall in Toronto

1971
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:59,100
and invite all the shareholders

1972
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,807
and it's gonna be embarrassing for management.

1973
01:17:00,807 --> 01:17:02,820
And I made reference to some nuclear winter,

1974
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:05,430
let's not have it be a nuclear winter.

1975
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:07,470
And they thought they'd embarrass me by releasing the email,

1976
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:08,913
but it only inspired us.

1977
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,430
And we rented the largest hall in Canada

1978
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:14,520
and we put up a presentation walking through,

1979
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,350
here's Canadian National, here's Canadian Pacific,

1980
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:18,300
here's what they said, here's what they did.

1981
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,260
And then we had Hunter get up,

1982
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,580
who's this incredibly charismatic guy from Tennessee,

1983
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:27,480
an amazing, he's like a lion, okay.

1984
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,160
Incredibly deep voice,

1985
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,510
unbelievable track record,

1986
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:32,220
incredibly respected guy.

1987
01:17:32,220 --> 01:17:35,738
It's like getting Michael Jordan to come out of retirement

1988
01:17:35,738 --> 01:17:38,640
and come and run the company.

1989
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,170
And Hunter was incredible.

1990
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,970
And other Paul Ell,

1991
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:44,613
other members of my team were super engaged.

1992
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:49,170
And the board, Canadians are known to be nice.

1993
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,790
So one of the problems we had is shareholders

1994
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:52,950
would never tell management or the board

1995
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,780
that they were losing.

1996
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,190
It was not until the night before the meeting

1997
01:17:56,190 --> 01:17:57,023
when the vote came in,

1998
01:17:57,023 --> 01:17:59,103
that management realized that they lost,

1999
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:01,890
we got 99% of the vote.

2000
01:18:01,890 --> 01:18:05,040
And they offered us a deal

2001
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:06,270
when they begged us to take a deal.

2002
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:08,550
They said, look, we'll resign tonight

2003
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,290
so that we don't have to come to the meeting tomorrow.

2004
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:11,517
That's how embarrassed they were.

2005
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:13,890
But that was kind of a interesting one.

2006
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,710
- So for in both this proxy battle

2007
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,720
and the company itself,

2008
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,680
this was a one of your more successful investments?

2009
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,590
- It was.

2010
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:24,300
I mean the stock's up about 10 times

2011
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,743
and it's an industrial company.

2012
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:28,080
It's a railroad, it's not like a growth.

2013
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,090
Like, it's not Google.

2014
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:30,923
So it's a great story.

2015
01:18:30,923 --> 01:18:33,360
And the company's now run by a guy named Keith Creel.

2016
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,210
And Keith, it was Hunter's protege.

2017
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:39,060
And in some many ways he's actually better than Hunter.

2018
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,510
He's doing an incredible job.

2019
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,800
The sad part here is we made it, we did very well.

2020
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,330
We tripled our money over several years.

2021
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:46,920
And then I went through a very challenging period

2022
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:49,350
because of a couple of bad investments

2023
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,180
and we had to sell our Canadian Pacific

2024
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:56,180
to raise capital to pay for investors who were leaving.

2025
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,340
But we had another opportunity to buy it back

2026
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,320
in the last couple of years.

2027
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:03,810
And so we're now again a major owner of the company,

2028
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,613
but had we held onto original stock,

2029
01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:09,393
it would've been epic, if you will.

2030
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:13,290
- So on this one, you were right.

2031
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,123
- [Bill] Yes.

2032
01:19:14,123 --> 01:19:16,650
- And I read an article about you

2033
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:18,120
and there's many articles about you.

2034
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,110
I read an article that said Bill is often right,

2035
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:26,610
but you approach it with a scorched earth approach

2036
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:30,510
that can often do more sort of damage.

2037
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:31,950
- I haven't read the often right article,

2038
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:33,600
but the good news is we are often right

2039
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,090
and I say we because we're a team,

2040
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:38,077
small team, but a fortunately very successful one.

2041
01:19:38,077 --> 01:19:40,770
You know, so our batting average

2042
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:42,480
as investors is extremely high.

2043
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,610
And the good news is our record's totally public.

2044
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:46,620
You can see everything we've ever done.

2045
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:48,600
But the press doesn't generally write

2046
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,600
about the success stories, they write about the failures.

2047
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,220
And so we've had some epic failures, big losses.

2048
01:19:56,220 --> 01:20:00,330
Good news is they've been a tiny minority of the cases.

2049
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:03,150
Now, no one likes to lose money.

2050
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:05,940
It's even worse to lose other people's money.

2051
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:08,190
And I've done that occasionally.

2052
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,800
The good news is, if you've stuck with us,

2053
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,740
you've done very well over a long time.

2054
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:16,540
- On a small tangent since we were talking about boards,

2055
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,080
did you get a chance to see

2056
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,270
what happened with the Open AI board?

2057
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,270
Because I'm talking to Sam Waltman soon.

2058
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:25,950
Is there any insight you have,

2059
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:30,300
just maybe lessons you draw from these kinds of events,

2060
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,190
especially with an AI technology company,

2061
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:34,800
such dramatic things happening.

2062
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,330
- Yeah, that was an incredible story.

2063
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,220
Look, governance really matters.

2064
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,860
And the governance structure of open AI

2065
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,530
I think leaves something to be desired.

2066
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:47,190
You know, I think Sam's point was this and maybe Musk,

2067
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:49,640
Elon Musk point originally set up as a nonprofit.

2068
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,740
And it reminds me actually,

2069
01:20:52,740 --> 01:20:57,450
I invested in a nonprofit run by a former Facebook founder

2070
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:59,760
where he was gonna create a Facebook-like entity

2071
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,410
for nonprofits to promote goodness in the world.

2072
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:06,630
And the problem was he couldn't hire the talent he wanted

2073
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,010
'cause he couldn't grant stock options,

2074
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:10,170
he couldn't pay market salaries.

2075
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,300
And ultimately he ended up selling the business

2076
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,950
to a for-profit.

2077
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:16,290
So it taught me for-profit solutions to problems

2078
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,700
are much better than nonprofits.

2079
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,380
And here you had kind of a blend, right?

2080
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,300
It was set up as a nonprofit,

2081
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,860
but I think they found the same thing.

2082
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,060
They couldn't hire the talent they wanted

2083
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:26,730
without having a for-profit subsidiary.

2084
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:30,960
But the nonprofit entity, as I understand it,

2085
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,310
owns or a big chunk of Open AI

2086
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,860
and the investors own sort of a capped interest

2087
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:40,290
where their upside is capped

2088
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:43,290
and they don't have representation on the board.

2089
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:47,670
And I think that was a setup for a problem

2090
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:49,920
and that's clearly what happened here.

2091
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,510
- And there's I guess some kind of

2092
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,940
complexity in the governance.

2093
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:58,230
I mean, because of this nonprofit and cap profit thing,

2094
01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:00,450
it seems like there's a bunch of complexity

2095
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:04,170
and non-standard aspects to it

2096
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:07,893
that perhaps also contributed to the problem.

2097
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:11,670
- Yeah, governance really matters.

2098
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:13,413
Boards of directors really matter.

2099
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:18,930
Giving the shareholders the right to have input

2100
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:21,240
at least once a year on the structure of the governance

2101
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,490
of companies is really important.

2102
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:26,190
And private venture backed boards

2103
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:27,480
are also not ideal.

2104
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:30,270
You know, I'm an active investor in ventures

2105
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:34,200
and there are some complicated issues that emerge

2106
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:38,250
in private as sort of venture stage companies

2107
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:42,870
where board members have somewhat divergent incentives from

2108
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:44,550
the long-term owners of a business.

2109
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:48,000
And what you see a lot in venture boards is

2110
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,670
they're presided over generally by

2111
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,630
venture capital investors

2112
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:53,820
who are big investors in the company.

2113
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:57,153
And oftentimes it's more important to them to give the,

2114
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,760
to have the public perception

2115
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,500
that they're good directors

2116
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,630
so they get the next best deal, right?

2117
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,570
If they have a reputation for kind of taking

2118
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:08,610
on management too aggressively

2119
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:10,890
word will get out in the small community of founders

2120
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:12,814
and they'll miss the next Google.

2121
01:23:12,814 --> 01:23:14,790
And so their interests are not just

2122
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:16,500
in that particular company,

2123
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,620
that's also, you know, one of the problems.

2124
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:21,690
Again, it all comes back to incentives.

2125
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,130
- Can you explain to me the difference

2126
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:26,580
a venture backed like VCs and shareholders?

2127
01:23:26,580 --> 01:23:28,980
So this means before the company goes public.

2128
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:31,770
- Yeah. So private venture backed companies,

2129
01:23:31,770 --> 01:23:33,423
the boards tend to be very small,

2130
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:37,740
could be a handful of the venture investors and management.

2131
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:42,030
They're often very rarely independent directors.

2132
01:23:42,030 --> 01:23:43,770
It's just not an ideal structure.

2133
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:45,360
- Oh, I see. You want independent.

2134
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,860
- It's beneficial to have people

2135
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,870
who have an economic interest in the business

2136
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:51,470
and they care only about the success of that company

2137
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:54,780
as opposed to someone who

2138
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,130
if you think about the venture business,

2139
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:57,990
getting into the best deals

2140
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:00,150
is more important than any one deal.

2141
01:24:00,150 --> 01:24:03,810
And you see cases where the boards go along with,

2142
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:06,960
in some sense cases bad behavior on the part of management

2143
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,420
because they want a reputation for being kind of

2144
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,880
a founder friendly director.

2145
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,100
You know that's kind of problematic.

2146
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:16,560
You don't have the same issue in public company boards.

2147
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,840
- So we talked about some of the big wins

2148
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,760
and you're a track record,

2149
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,798
but you said there were some big losses.

2150
01:24:23,798 --> 01:24:27,120
So what's the biggest loss of your career?

2151
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,050
- Biggest loss in my career

2152
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,940
is a company called Vion Pharmaceuticals.

2153
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:30,990
We made an investment in business

2154
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,840
that didn't meet our core principles,

2155
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:35,040
problem in the pharmaceutical industry

2156
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,200
and there are many problems, as I've learned,

2157
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:39,540
is it's a very volatile business, right?

2158
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,103
It's based on drug discovery,

2159
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:45,930
it's based on predicting kinda the future revenues

2160
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:47,730
of a drug before it goes off patent.

2161
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,790
You know lots of complexities.

2162
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,900
And we thought we had found

2163
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:54,630
a pharmaceutical company we could own

2164
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,100
'cause of a very unusual founder

2165
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,983
in the way he approached this business.

2166
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:02,040
It was a company where another activist

2167
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,660
was on the board of directors of the company

2168
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,770
and kind of governing

2169
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,300
and overseeing the day-to-day decisions.

2170
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,790
And we ended up making a passive investment in the company.

2171
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,623
And up until this point in time,

2172
01:25:09,623 --> 01:25:12,360
we really didn't make passive investments.

2173
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,220
And the company made a series of decisions

2174
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:16,830
that were disastrous

2175
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:18,560
and then we stepped in to try to solve the problem.

2176
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,310
It was the first time I ever joined a board

2177
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:21,450
and the mess was much larger

2178
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,190
than I realized from the outside.

2179
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:25,110
And then I was kind of stuck.

2180
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:29,310
And it was very much a confidence sensitive strategy,

2181
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:30,810
'cause they built their business

2182
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:33,300
by acquiring pharmaceutical assets

2183
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,560
and they often issued stock

2184
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,960
when they acquired targets.

2185
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,170
And so once the market lost confidence in management,

2186
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,400
the stock price got crushed

2187
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,170
and it impaired their ability

2188
01:25:43,170 --> 01:25:46,950
to continue to acquire low costs drugs.

2189
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:49,897
And we lost $4 billion.

2190
01:25:49,897 --> 01:25:51,000
- $4 billion?

2191
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,710
- Yeah. How's that for a big loss?

2192
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:53,543
- [Lex] That's--

2193
01:25:53,543 --> 01:25:54,376
- It's up there.

2194
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:56,910
- I'm sweating this whole conversation,

2195
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:59,850
both the wins and the losses and the stakes involved.

2196
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:03,120
- And by the way, that loss catalyzed other,

2197
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,250
what I call market to market losses.

2198
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:09,993
So very high profile, huge number, disastrous press.

2199
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,070
Then people said, okay, Bill's gonna go outta business,

2200
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:16,110
so we're gonna bet against everything he's doing

2201
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:16,950
and we know his entire

2202
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:19,140
portfolio 'cause we only own 10 things.

2203
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:21,390
And we were short a company called Herbalife.

2204
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,530
Very famously, we've only really shorted two companies.

2205
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:27,120
The first one, there's a book,

2206
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:28,830
the second one there's a movie.

2207
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,813
Okay, we no longer short companies,

2208
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:34,203
so people pushed up the price of Herbalife,

2209
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,460
which is when you're a short seller, that's catastrophic.

2210
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:39,420
I can explain that.

2211
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:42,990
And then they also shorted the other stocks that we owned.

2212
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:44,730
And so that valiant loss

2213
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:47,640
led to an overall more than 30% loss

2214
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,470
in the value of our portfolio.

2215
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:53,100
The valiant loss was real and was crystallized.

2216
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:56,010
We ended up selling the position taking that loss.

2217
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,230
Most of the other losses were what I would call

2218
01:26:58,230 --> 01:27:00,780
market to market losses that were temporary.

2219
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:02,250
But many people go outta business

2220
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:05,430
because as I mentioned before, large move in a price.

2221
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:08,160
If investors are redeeming or you have leverage,

2222
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,660
you know, can put you outta business.

2223
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:11,640
And people assumed if we got put outta business,

2224
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:13,080
we'd have to sell everything

2225
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,090
or cover our short position

2226
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,320
and that would make the losses even worse,

2227
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:17,790
so Wall Street is kind of ruthless.

2228
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:19,920
- So they can make money off of that whole thing?

2229
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:20,753
- [Bill] Absolutely.

2230
01:27:20,753 --> 01:27:22,020
- So they use the opportunity of Valiant

2231
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:25,350
to try to destroy you, reputation,

2232
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:27,440
financially, and then capitalize on,

2233
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,040
make money off of that?

2234
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:29,873
- [Bill] Yes.

2235
01:27:29,873 --> 01:27:32,220
- Well, that's a terrifying spot to be in.

2236
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,260
What was it like going through that?

2237
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:35,260
- I was pretty grim.

2238
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,040
It's actually much worse than that

2239
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:41,070
because I had a lot of stuff going on personally as well

2240
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:42,780
and these things tend to be correlated.

2241
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:45,330
The valiant mistake came at a time

2242
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,640
where I was contemplating my marriage

2243
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,060
and I was also...

2244
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:53,280
The problem with the hedge fund business

2245
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,170
is when you get to a certain scale,

2246
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,160
the CEO becomes like

2247
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,600
the chief marketing officer of the business.

2248
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,330
And I'm really an investor as opposed to a marketing guy.

2249
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:01,920
But when you have investors who give you

2250
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:02,910
a few hundred million dollars,

2251
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,500
they wanna see you, you know,

2252
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,930
once a year bill, I'd love to see you for an hour.

2253
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:08,850
But if you've got a couple hundred of those,

2254
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:12,750
you find yourself on a plane to the Middle East to Asia,

2255
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:14,340
flying around the country.

2256
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,280
This is pre Zoom

2257
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:20,942
and that takes you away from the investment process.

2258
01:28:20,942 --> 01:28:22,380
You have to delegate more.

2259
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:25,380
That was a contributor to the valiant mistake.

2260
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:28,080
So now we lose a ton of money on valiant.

2261
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,560
My ex-wife and I were talking about separating,

2262
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,030
getting divorced, I put that on hold.

2263
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:34,410
So I didn't wanna make a decision

2264
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:36,513
in the middle of this crisis.

2265
01:28:37,530 --> 01:28:39,390
And things just kept getting worse.

2266
01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:41,970
We were also sued when you lose a lot of money.

2267
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:43,020
We didn't get sued by our investors,

2268
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:44,730
but we got sued by a shareholder

2269
01:28:44,730 --> 01:28:47,790
because when the stock price goes down, shareholders sue,

2270
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:50,760
we'd done nothing wrong other than make a big mistake.

2271
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,620
So you have litigation,

2272
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,720
your investors are taking their money out.

2273
01:28:55,853 --> 01:28:57,630
I'm in the middle of a divorce,

2274
01:28:57,630 --> 01:28:59,613
the divorce starts to proceed.

2275
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,910
My ex-wife's lawyer's expectations

2276
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,740
of what my net worth was about

2277
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,900
three times what it actually was

2278
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:10,080
and it was going lower right in the middle of this.

2279
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,427
And I remember the lawyer saying,

2280
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:16,417
"Look Bill, estimate your net worth at X,

2281
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:18,930
"but don't worry, we only want a third".

2282
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:23,930
But X was 3X so a third was a hundred percent (laughs)

2283
01:29:24,190 --> 01:29:29,160
And then I had litigation and actually never

2284
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,480
before publicly disclosed,

2285
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,670
and I'll share it with you now.

2286
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,210
We had a public company that owned

2287
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:38,940
about a third of our portfolio

2288
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:41,673
that was called our version of Berkshire Hathaway.

2289
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,970
I tried to learn from Mr. Buffett over time,

2290
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:47,160
and it was, so to speak, permanent capital.

2291
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,230
The problem with hedge funds

2292
01:29:48,230 --> 01:29:50,513
is people can take their money out every quarter.

2293
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,340
What Buffet has is a company

2294
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:54,510
where people wanna take their money out,

2295
01:29:54,510 --> 01:29:56,610
they sell the stock, but the money stays.

2296
01:29:56,610 --> 01:29:59,817
So we set up a similar structure in October of 2014,

2297
01:29:59,817 --> 01:30:02,430
and then a year later Valiant happens,

2298
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:03,570
and then a year later we're in the middle

2299
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:05,910
of the mess and we're still in the mess.

2300
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:09,720
You know, like by kind of mid 2017,

2301
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,170
we've got litigation underway

2302
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,583
and another activist investor,

2303
01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:17,220
a firm called Elliot Associates,

2304
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:20,160
which is run by a guy named Paul Singer,

2305
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,310
took a big position in our public company

2306
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:25,260
that was the bulk of our capital

2307
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:27,900
and they shorted all the stocks that we owned.

2308
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:28,733
And they went long.

2309
01:30:28,733 --> 01:30:30,390
The short probably went long, the short

2310
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:32,190
that we were short

2311
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:34,890
and they were making a bet that we'd be forced to liquidate

2312
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:36,900
and then they would make money on, you know,

2313
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:39,150
our public company was trading at a discount

2314
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:40,110
to what all the securities worth.

2315
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:42,540
So they bought the public company,

2316
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,310
they shorted the securities,

2317
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:46,590
and then they came to see us

2318
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,420
and to try to be activists

2319
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:52,700
and force us to liquidate and that sort of...

2320
01:30:54,358 --> 01:30:56,340
So I thought this was gonna be...

2321
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:58,890
I envisioned an end where

2322
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:01,260
the divorce takes all of my resources.

2323
01:31:01,260 --> 01:31:04,140
The permanent capital vehicle ends up getting liquidated.

2324
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:07,623
And another activist in my industry puts me outta business.

2325
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:11,940
And I had met Neri Oxman right around this time,

2326
01:31:11,940 --> 01:31:14,130
and I'd fallen completely in love with her.

2327
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:17,430
And I was envisioning a world where I was bankrupt.

2328
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:20,730
A judge found me guilty of whatever,

2329
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:23,010
he sends me off to jail or not that judge

2330
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:23,843
'cause he was a civil judge,

2331
01:31:23,843 --> 01:31:26,970
but another judge sues the SEC Department of Justice.

2332
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:29,250
And I find myself in this incredible mess.

2333
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,103
And I decided I didn't want things to end that way.

2334
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,460
So I did something I'd never done before.

2335
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:37,320
I talked to all before about you don't borrow money,

2336
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,857
I borrowed money and I borrowed

2337
01:31:38,857 --> 01:31:43,857
$300 million from JP Morgan in the middle of this mess.

2338
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:49,683
And I gave JP Morgan enormous credit in seeing through it.

2339
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:54,030
And also I had been a good client

2340
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:54,870
over a long period of time

2341
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:56,620
and it's like it's a handshake bank

2342
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,040
and they bet that I would succeed.

2343
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,990
And I took that money to buy enough stock

2344
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:03,660
in my public company that I could prevent

2345
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,280
an activist from taking over

2346
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,050
and effectively buy control

2347
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,500
of our little public company.

2348
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:10,920
And I got that done.

2349
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:13,950
And that I knew was the moment, the turning point.

2350
01:32:13,950 --> 01:32:16,050
And I resolved my divorce

2351
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:17,460
and divorces get easier to resolve

2352
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:18,750
when things are going badly.

2353
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:19,710
I was able to resolve that.

2354
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:21,510
We settled the litigation.

2355
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:23,460
I was buying blocks of our stock in the market.

2356
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:26,448
I remember a day I bought a big block of stock in the market

2357
01:32:26,448 --> 01:32:28,260
and I get a call from Gordon Singer,

2358
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,580
who's Paul Singer's son

2359
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:33,270
who runs their London part of their business.

2360
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,310
And he's like, "Bill, was that you buying that block?"

2361
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:38,407
I said, yes. And he's like, "Fuck".

2362
01:32:38,407 --> 01:32:39,450
(both laughing)

2363
01:32:39,450 --> 01:32:40,620
- So he knew--

2364
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,150
- He knew that once I got that

2365
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:44,850
they were not gonna be able to succeed and they went away.

2366
01:32:44,850 --> 01:32:47,253
And that was the bottom.

2367
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:51,540
And that we've had an incredible run since then.

2368
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,370
- And there you were able to protect your reputation

2369
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:56,670
from the valiant failure still?

2370
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,530
- I mean this is a business

2371
01:32:58,530 --> 01:32:59,790
where you're gonna make some mistakes.

2372
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:01,140
It was a big one.

2373
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:03,480
It was very reputationally damaging

2374
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,703
the press was a total disaster.

2375
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:08,490
But I'm not a quitter.

2376
01:33:08,490 --> 01:33:11,073
And actually the key moments for us,

2377
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:14,130
we'd never taken our core investment principles

2378
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,740
and actually really written them down

2379
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,640
something we talked about at meetings,

2380
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:21,870
kind of our investment team meetings.

2381
01:33:21,870 --> 01:33:22,717
I had a member of the team, I said,

2382
01:33:22,717 --> 01:33:26,317
"Look, go find a big piece of granite and a chisel

2383
01:33:26,317 --> 01:33:27,907
"and let's take those core principles.

2384
01:33:27,907 --> 01:33:30,330
"I want them like Moses' 10 commandments".

2385
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:31,277
We're gonna chisel em

2386
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:32,520
and then we're gonna put it up on the wall.

2387
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:33,630
And once we produce those,

2388
01:33:33,630 --> 01:33:34,860
we put one on everyone's desk.

2389
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,930
I said, look, if we ever again veer

2390
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:38,180
from the core principles,

2391
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:41,190
hit me with a baseball bat.

2392
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:42,060
And that was the bottom.

2393
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:43,829
And ever since then,

2394
01:33:43,829 --> 01:33:45,240
we've had the best six years in the history of the firm.

2395
01:33:45,240 --> 01:33:47,967
- So refocus on the fundamentals--

2396
01:33:49,230 --> 01:33:50,550
- And love helps. - Hell of a story.

2397
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:53,190
- Love helps. I literally met Neri at the absolute bottom.

2398
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:55,860
Our first date was September 7th, 2017.

2399
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:57,240
That was very close to the bottom.

2400
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,100
Actually, there's one other element to the story.

2401
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,950
So this went on for a few months after I met her.

2402
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:05,010
The other element is that one day I get a call from Neri

2403
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:06,908
and she's like, 'Bill, guess what?"

2404
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:07,920
I'm like, "What?"

2405
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,260
Brad Pitt is coming to the media lab.

2406
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,493
He wants to see my work.

2407
01:34:12,441 --> 01:34:13,650
I'm like, that's beautiful sweetheart.

2408
01:34:13,650 --> 01:34:14,483
I didn't know Brad Pitt

2409
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:15,740
was interested in your work.

2410
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:19,800
- As a man that's a difficult phone call to take.

2411
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,600
- And apparently he's really interested in architecture.

2412
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,980
I'm like, okay, now Neri and I were like,

2413
01:34:25,980 --> 01:34:28,260
we would WhatsApp all day every day,

2414
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:29,793
we talk throughout the day.

2415
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:32,910
Brad Pitt shows up at the media lab at 10 o'clock.

2416
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:35,240
I talk to her in the morning.

2417
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,500
I kind of text her to see how things are going.

2418
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,640
Don't hear back.

2419
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,410
And on WhatsApp you can see like

2420
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:42,176
whether the other person's read it or not.

2421
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,170
- Yeah, yeah. Okay.

2422
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:44,460
- No response.

2423
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:47,160
A couple hours later, send her another text, no response.

2424
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,750
Six o'clock, no response.

2425
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:50,010
Eight o'clock, no response.

2426
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:52,080
10 o'clock, no response.

2427
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:56,100
And you know she finally calls me at 10:30

2428
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,900
and tells me how great Brad Pitt is.

2429
01:34:59,012 --> 01:35:00,360
So I had this scenario, okay,

2430
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:02,160
a judge is gonna find me,

2431
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,660
we're gonna lose to the judge.

2432
01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:07,500
All my assets will disappear.

2433
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:09,750
And then Brad Pitt's gonna take my girlfriend.

2434
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,520
- Brad Pitt's your competition. This is great.

2435
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,290
- So it was like a moment.

2436
01:35:13,290 --> 01:35:15,420
That was sort of the bottom.

2437
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:17,160
And then sort of the motivational thing.

2438
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:18,540
I didn't wanna lose to an activist,

2439
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:21,093
didn't wanna lose my girl to some other guy.

2440
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:25,050
- Brad Pitt and you emerged from all that,

2441
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:27,060
the winner on all fronts.

2442
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:30,063
- I'm a very fortunate guy, very fortunate and lucky.

2443
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:33,060
- You talked about some of the technical aspects of that.

2444
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:35,643
But psychologically is there a,

2445
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:39,300
like what are you doing at night by yourself?

2446
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,140
- That was a hard time.

2447
01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:43,040
Hard time 'cause I was separated from my wife and my kids.

2448
01:35:44,010 --> 01:35:47,193
I was living in not the greatest apartment,

2449
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:50,453
I had a beautiful home

2450
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:53,190
and so I had to go find like a bachelor place

2451
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:56,880
and I didn't wanna be away from my kids.

2452
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,230
I moved like 10 blocks away

2453
01:35:58,230 --> 01:35:59,730
and I wasn't seeing them and they didn't like it.

2454
01:35:59,730 --> 01:36:02,700
So I ended up buying an apartment I didn't like

2455
01:36:02,700 --> 01:36:03,990
in the same building as my kids,

2456
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,340
like, with a different entrance.

2457
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,537
So I could be near them.

2458
01:36:06,537 --> 01:36:07,860
But I was home alone.

2459
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:12,000
I got a dog that was a bar

2460
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,760
We call 'em a bar that, not the elephant.

2461
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,010
He's a black Labradoodle.

2462
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:18,450
He was supposed to be a mini,

2463
01:36:18,450 --> 01:36:19,743
but he's not so as mini.

2464
01:36:21,660 --> 01:36:23,130
But I got him at six weeks old

2465
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:24,507
and he would keep me company.

2466
01:36:24,507 --> 01:36:26,493
And I started meditating actually.

2467
01:36:27,330 --> 01:36:30,933
And a friend recommended TM.

2468
01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:33,570
And I would meditate 20 minutes in the morning,

2469
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:34,800
20 minutes in the evening.

2470
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,260
And I also a big believer in exercise

2471
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:39,700
and weightlifting and I played tennis

2472
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:42,993
and I had been, this is not my first,

2473
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,590
proximity to disaster.

2474
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:51,113
I had another moment in my career like, you know, 2002.

2475
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:54,000
And I learned this method

2476
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,620
for dealing with these kind of moments,

2477
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:59,100
which is you just make a little progress every day.

2478
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:01,110
So today I'm gonna wake up,

2479
01:37:01,110 --> 01:37:02,670
I'm gonna make progress,

2480
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:03,930
I'll make progress on the litigation,

2481
01:37:03,930 --> 01:37:05,640
I'll make progress on the portfolio,

2482
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,980
I'll make progress with my life.

2483
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:12,270
And progress compounds a bit like money compounds.

2484
01:37:12,270 --> 01:37:14,790
You don't see a lot of progress in the first few weeks,

2485
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:16,590
but like 30 days in you're like, oh, okay.

2486
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:18,720
Like you can't look up at the mountaintop

2487
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:19,920
where you used to be

2488
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:21,870
'cause then you'll give up, right?

2489
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:24,610
But you just, okay, just make step by step by step

2490
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:26,730
and then 90 days in you're like,

2491
01:37:26,730 --> 01:37:29,103
okay, I was way down there.

2492
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:30,753
I'm okay. I don't look up.

2493
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:34,500
Just keep making progress, progress, progress

2494
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:36,270
and progress really does compound.

2495
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:37,103
And one day you wake up

2496
01:37:37,103 --> 01:37:39,420
and like, wow, it's amazing how far I've come.

2497
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:43,980
And if you look at a chart of Pershing Square, our company,

2498
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,723
you can see the absolute bottom,

2499
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:47,640
you can see where we were,

2500
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:51,030
you can see the drop and you can see where we are now.

2501
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:54,210
And that huge drop that felt like

2502
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:56,700
a complete unbelievable disaster

2503
01:37:56,700 --> 01:38:00,060
looks like a little bump on the curve

2504
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:03,180
and it really gives you perspective on these things.

2505
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:04,920
You just have to power through.

2506
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,153
And I think the key is,

2507
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:08,460
I've always been fortunate,

2508
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,490
like from a mental health point of view

2509
01:38:11,490 --> 01:38:15,030
and nutrition, sleep, exercise,

2510
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:17,078
and a little progress every day, that's it.

2511
01:38:17,078 --> 01:38:19,740
And you know, good friends and family,

2512
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,650
I had, you know, go take a walk

2513
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:24,780
with a friend every night,

2514
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,940
and a sister who loves me

2515
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:29,193
and parents who were supportive,

2516
01:38:29,193 --> 01:38:32,103
but they were all worried about their son, their brother.

2517
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,530
It was a moment.

2518
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:36,450
And also, by the way, the other thing to think about

2519
01:38:36,450 --> 01:38:40,470
is when you recover from something like this,

2520
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:43,980
you really appreciate it (laughs)

2521
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:48,360
And also as much of the media loves,

2522
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:51,390
okay, when some successful person falls,

2523
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:53,460
they love writing the story of success.

2524
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:55,500
They love even more the story of failure

2525
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:56,700
but when you recover from that,

2526
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,450
it's kinda like the American story.

2527
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:02,640
America, you know, you think of the great entrepreneurs

2528
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:05,100
and how many failures they had before they succeeded.

2529
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,350
How many rocket launches

2530
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,693
did SpaceX have explode on the pad?

2531
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:11,820
And then you look at success.

2532
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:14,220
I mean, that's why Musk is so admired.

2533
01:39:14,220 --> 01:39:15,270
- You mentioned Herbalife.

2534
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:17,973
Can you take me through the saga of that?

2535
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:21,573
It's historic.

2536
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,480
- So we at Pershing Square, short of very few stocks.

2537
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,670
And the reason for that is short selling

2538
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:31,860
is just inherently treacherous.

2539
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,750
So if you buy a stock,

2540
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:35,220
it's called going long, right?

2541
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,690
You're buying something,

2542
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:38,430
your worst case scenario is you lose your whole investment.

2543
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:39,720
You buy a stock for a hundred, it goes to zero,

2544
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,070
you loose a hundred dollars, right?

2545
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:43,170
Per share. You buy one share of a hundred.

2546
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:45,261
You shortest stock at a hundred

2547
01:39:45,261 --> 01:39:48,510
what it means is you borrow the security from someone else.

2548
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:50,790
The analogy I gave that made it easy for people

2549
01:39:50,790 --> 01:39:53,880
to understand, it's a bit like you think,

2550
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,250
silver coins are gonna go down in value

2551
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:59,640
and you have a friend who's got a whole pile of these

2552
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,517
1880 silver US dollars,

2553
01:40:02,517 --> 01:40:03,387
and you think they're gonna go down in value

2554
01:40:03,387 --> 01:40:05,460
and you say, hey, can I borrow

2555
01:40:05,460 --> 01:40:06,990
10 of those dollars from you?

2556
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:08,880
He's like, sure, but what are you gonna pay me to borrow?

2557
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,100
I'll pay you interest

2558
01:40:13,538 --> 01:40:14,610
on the value of the dollars today.

2559
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:16,230
So you borrow the dollars

2560
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:18,510
that are worth a hundred dollars each today.

2561
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:20,520
You pay 'em interest while you're borrowing them.

2562
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,353
And then you go sell 'em

2563
01:40:21,353 --> 01:40:22,260
in the market for a hundred dollars.

2564
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:23,760
That's what they're worth.

2565
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:26,430
And then they go down in price to 50.

2566
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:29,580
You go back in, you buy the silver dollars back at $50

2567
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:30,570
and you give 'em back to your friend.

2568
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:31,950
Your friend is complete fine.

2569
01:40:31,950 --> 01:40:33,900
You borrowed 10, you gave him the 10 back

2570
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:35,040
and he got interest in the meantime,

2571
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,980
he's happy he made money on his coin collection.

2572
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:41,070
You however made $50 times the 10 coins, you made 500 bucks.

2573
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:42,720
That's pretty good.

2574
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,100
The problem with that is,

2575
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:45,930
what if you sell them

2576
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:48,060
and they go from a hundred to a thousand,

2577
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:50,040
now you're gonna have to go buy them back

2578
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:55,020
and you gotta pay whatever, $10,000 to buy back coins.

2579
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,000
You know that you sold for 500,

2580
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,100
you're gonna lose $9,500.

2581
01:40:59,100 --> 01:41:00,930
And there's no limit, right?

2582
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,460
To how high a stock price can go.

2583
01:41:02,460 --> 01:41:04,800
Companies go to $3 trillion in value, right?

2584
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,990
Tesla, a lot of people shorted Tesla saying,

2585
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:08,250
oh, it's overvalued,

2586
01:41:08,250 --> 01:41:11,550
he's never gonna be able to make a successful electric car.

2587
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:15,090
Well, I'm sure they're people went bankrupt shorting Tesla.

2588
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:16,710
That's why we didn't short stocks.

2589
01:41:16,710 --> 01:41:20,700
But I was presented with this actual reporter

2590
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,340
that covered the other short investment

2591
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:24,570
we made early in the career.

2592
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:26,347
A company called MBIA came to me and said,

2593
01:41:26,347 --> 01:41:27,487
"Bill, I found this incredible company.

2594
01:41:27,487 --> 01:41:28,327
"You gotta take a look at it.

2595
01:41:28,327 --> 01:41:29,257
"It's a total fraud

2596
01:41:29,257 --> 01:41:30,750
"and they're scamming poor people".

2597
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:33,510
- And we should say that NBIA was a very successful short.

2598
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:35,910
- It was, big part of it was

2599
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:38,040
that we used a different kind of instrument to short it

2600
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:40,400
where we reversed that sort of,

2601
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,110
we made the investment asymmetric in our favor,

2602
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:44,730
meaning put up a small amount of money

2603
01:41:44,730 --> 01:41:46,710
if it works and make a fortune.

2604
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:48,960
Whereas short selling is you kind of sell something

2605
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,180
and you have to buy it back at a higher price.

2606
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:53,400
Herbalife didn't have the,

2607
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:56,220
what's called credit default swaps that you could purchase.

2608
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,053
Not a big enough company.

2609
01:41:57,053 --> 01:41:58,470
You didn't have enough debt outstanding

2610
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:59,670
to be able to implement it.

2611
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:01,380
You had to short the stock

2612
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:03,120
in order to make it as successful

2613
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,800
to bet against the company.

2614
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,174
And the more work I did in the company,

2615
01:42:06,174 --> 01:42:07,007
the more I was like, oh my God,

2616
01:42:07,007 --> 01:42:08,760
this thing's an incredible scam.

2617
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,240
You know, that they purport to sell weight loss shakes,

2618
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,890
but in reality they're selling

2619
01:42:13,890 --> 01:42:15,330
kind of a fake business plan.

2620
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:18,000
And the people that adopt it lose money.

2621
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,490
And they go after poor people.

2622
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:22,440
They go after actually in many cases,

2623
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,780
undocumented immigrants

2624
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:28,890
who are pitched on the American Dream opportunity.

2625
01:42:28,890 --> 01:42:30,840
And because they have few other options

2626
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,720
because they can't get legal employment,

2627
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,370
they become Herbalife distributors.

2628
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:37,470
And it's a business where you,

2629
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:39,210
so-called multi-level marketing

2630
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:41,140
or multi-level marketing, sort of

2631
01:42:42,044 --> 01:42:45,300
the name for a legitimate company like this

2632
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,440
or it's a pyramid scheme

2633
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:47,400
where basically your sales

2634
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,170
are really only coming from people who

2635
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:50,430
you convinced to buy the product

2636
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:51,990
by getting them into the business.

2637
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:54,090
That's precisely what this company is.

2638
01:42:54,090 --> 01:42:58,290
And like, okay, shorting a pyramid scheme seems like one,

2639
01:42:58,290 --> 01:42:59,190
we'll make a bunch of money,

2640
01:42:59,190 --> 01:43:02,250
but two, the world will be behind us

2641
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:03,840
because they're harming poor people.

2642
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,220
You know, regulators will get interested

2643
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:06,210
in a company like this.

2644
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:09,420
And we thought the FTC is gonna shut this thing down.

2645
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,890
And we did a ton of work

2646
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:14,430
and I gave this sort of epic presentation

2647
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,170
laying out all the facts.

2648
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:18,390
Stock got completely crushed

2649
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:19,890
and we were on our way.

2650
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:22,020
And the government actually got interested early on,

2651
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:23,490
launched an investigation pretty early,

2652
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,713
SEC and otherwise,

2653
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:31,240
but then a guy named Carl Icahn showed up

2654
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,890
and we have a little bit of a backstory,

2655
01:43:34,890 --> 01:43:37,110
but his motivations here were not really principally driven

2656
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:38,610
by thinking HerbalLife was a good company,

2657
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:42,570
he thought it was a good way to hurt me.

2658
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:44,820
So he basically bought a bunch of stock

2659
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:46,260
and said it was a really great company.

2660
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:48,090
And you know, Carl at least at the time,

2661
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:49,530
threw his weight around a bit.

2662
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:51,030
I was a credible investor,

2663
01:43:51,030 --> 01:43:52,180
had a lot of resources

2664
01:43:53,759 --> 01:43:56,283
and that began the saga.

2665
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,503
- So he was, we should say,

2666
01:44:00,810 --> 01:44:03,150
a legendary investor himself.

2667
01:44:03,150 --> 01:44:04,560
- I'd say legendary in a sense.

2668
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,880
Yes, for sure.

2669
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:08,640
An iconic Carl icon.

2670
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,520
- Oh, that's very well done.

2671
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:11,880
- Yeah. So definitely a iconic investor.

2672
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:15,150
- So what was the backstory between the two of you?

2673
01:44:15,150 --> 01:44:17,910
- So I mentioned that I had another period of time

2674
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:19,860
where significant business challenges,

2675
01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:21,840
this was my first fund called Gotham Partners.

2676
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,760
And we had a court stop a transaction

2677
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,210
between a private company we owned in a public company.

2678
01:44:27,210 --> 01:44:28,443
It's another long story.

2679
01:44:29,476 --> 01:44:32,040
- I would love to hear it as well.

2680
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:34,830
- But it was really my deciding to wind up my former fund.

2681
01:44:34,830 --> 01:44:37,200
And we owned a big stake in a company called

2682
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,580
Harwood Realty Partners,

2683
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:40,830
which was a company that owned real estate assets

2684
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,810
and it was worth a lot more than we was trading,

2685
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:45,870
but it needed an activist to really unlock the value.

2686
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:48,810
And we were in fact going outta business

2687
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:51,420
and didn't have the time or the resources to pursue it.

2688
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,163
So I sold it to Carl Icahn,

2689
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:56,370
and I sold it to him at a premium

2690
01:44:56,370 --> 01:44:57,300
to where the stock was trading.

2691
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:58,560
I think the stock was like 66,

2692
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,910
I sold it to him for 80,

2693
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:01,323
but it was worth about 150.

2694
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,550
And I said, look, and part of the deal was Carl's like,

2695
01:45:05,550 --> 01:45:07,500
look, I'll give you Schmuck Insurance.

2696
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,320
You know I'll make you sure you don't look bad.

2697
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,140
And I had another deal at a higher price

2698
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,790
without Schmuck Insurance.

2699
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:16,050
When I deal with Carl at a lower price

2700
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:16,883
with Schmuck Insurance

2701
01:45:16,883 --> 01:45:17,970
and the way the Schmuck Insurance went,

2702
01:45:17,970 --> 01:45:20,247
he said, look, "Bill, if I sell the stock

2703
01:45:20,247 --> 01:45:24,367
"in the next three years for a higher price

2704
01:45:24,367 --> 01:45:26,217
"I'll give you 50% of my profit".

2705
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:28,780
That's a pretty good deal.

2706
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:31,170
So we made that deal

2707
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:33,060
and 'cause I was dealing with Carl Icahn

2708
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:36,870
who had a reputation for being difficult.

2709
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:38,880
I was very focused on the agreement

2710
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,000
and we didn't want him to be able to be cute.

2711
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,990
So the agreement said if he sells

2712
01:45:45,990 --> 01:45:48,570
or otherwise transfers his shares.

2713
01:45:48,570 --> 01:45:49,890
And we came up with a definition

2714
01:45:49,890 --> 01:45:51,330
to include every version of sale.

2715
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:52,980
Okay. 'cause you know, it's Carl.

2716
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:57,450
Well, he then buys the stake

2717
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:59,670
and then makes a bid for the company.

2718
01:45:59,670 --> 01:46:01,857
And plan is for him to get the company.

2719
01:46:01,857 --> 01:46:04,080
And he bids like 120 a share.

2720
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,470
And the company hires Morgan Stanley to sell itself

2721
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:10,530
and he raises bid to 125, and then 130,

2722
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:13,140
eventually gets sold, I don't remember the exact price,

2723
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:15,183
let's say $145 a share.

2724
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,850
And Carl's not the winning bidder

2725
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,030
and he sells his stock,

2726
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:25,590
or he loses or transfers his shares for $145 a share.

2727
01:46:25,590 --> 01:46:27,660
So he owes actually our investors

2728
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:31,110
the difference between 145 and 80 times 50%.

2729
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:32,760
And I had like lawyers never like you

2730
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,920
to put like a arithmetic example.

2731
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,660
I put like a formula

2732
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:39,110
like out of a math book in the document

2733
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:40,170
so there can be no confusion.

2734
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:42,960
It was only an eight page, really simple agreement.

2735
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,580
So the deal closes

2736
01:46:44,580 --> 01:46:45,420
and he's supposed to pay us

2737
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,000
in two business days or three business days.

2738
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,100
I wait a few business days, no money comes in.

2739
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,007
I called Carl, I'm like,

2740
01:46:51,007 --> 01:46:55,770
"Carl, congratulations on her on the Hal Realty".

2741
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:57,169
Thanks Bill.

2742
01:46:57,169 --> 01:46:58,177
I said, "Carl, I just wanna remind you,

2743
01:46:58,177 --> 01:47:00,055
"I know it's been a few years,

2744
01:47:00,055 --> 01:47:02,437
"but you know we have this agreement,

2745
01:47:02,437 --> 01:47:04,110
"remember the Schmuck Insurance?"

2746
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:05,400
He's like, yeah.

2747
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,499
I said, "Well, you owe us our Schmuck Insurance".

2748
01:47:08,499 --> 01:47:10,890
He said, "What do you mean I didn't sell my shares?"

2749
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:14,250
I said, "Do you still have the shares?"

2750
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:15,360
He says, "No".

2751
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:16,920
I said, "What happened to them?"

2752
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:21,420
Well, the company did a merger for cash

2753
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:24,393
and they took away my shares, but I didn't sell them.

2754
01:47:26,054 --> 01:47:27,030
Do you understand what happened?

2755
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,567
So I said, "Carl, I'm gonna have to sue you".

2756
01:47:28,567 --> 01:47:32,081
He said, "Sue me, I'm gonna sue you".

2757
01:47:32,081 --> 01:47:35,490
He says, so I sued him

2758
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:38,427
and the legal system in America can take some time.

2759
01:47:38,427 --> 01:47:40,380
And what he would do is we sued

2760
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:43,473
and then we won in the whatever New York Supreme Court,

2761
01:47:45,330 --> 01:47:47,070
and then he appealed

2762
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:49,950
and you can appeal like six months after the case.

2763
01:47:49,950 --> 01:47:54,716
We waited to the 179th day and then he would appeal.

2764
01:47:54,716 --> 01:47:56,536
And then we fought it at the next level.

2765
01:47:56,536 --> 01:47:57,369
And then he would appeal.

2766
01:47:57,369 --> 01:47:58,380
And he appealed all the way to the Supreme Court.

2767
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:00,300
Of course the Supreme Court wouldn't take the case.

2768
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:01,320
It took years.

2769
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,550
Now as part of our agreement,

2770
01:48:02,550 --> 01:48:05,610
we got 9% interest on the money that he owed us.

2771
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:08,220
So I viewed it as my Carl Icahn money market account

2772
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:10,350
with a much higher interest rate.

2773
01:48:10,350 --> 01:48:12,450
And eventually I won.

2774
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:13,530
- What was the amount?

2775
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:14,580
- Just tiny.

2776
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:16,470
Now, it was material to my investors.

2777
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:19,680
So my first fund, I wound it down

2778
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,390
but I wanted to maximize

2779
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:22,680
everything from my investors, right?

2780
01:48:22,680 --> 01:48:24,870
These are the people backed me at 26 years old.

2781
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:25,703
I was right outta business school,

2782
01:48:25,703 --> 01:48:28,170
had no experience and they supported me.

2783
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:30,563
So I'm gonna go to the end of the earth for them.

2784
01:48:31,472 --> 01:48:33,840
And four and a half million relative to our fund at the end

2785
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,450
was maybe 400 million so it wasn't a huge number,

2786
01:48:36,450 --> 01:48:38,850
but it was a big percentage of what was left

2787
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,590
after I sold all our liquid security.

2788
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:42,210
So I was fighting for it.

2789
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:43,620
So we got four and a half million plus interest

2790
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:44,970
for eight years or something.

2791
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:47,040
That's how long the litigation took.

2792
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:48,213
So we got about double.

2793
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:52,350
So he owed me $9 million, which to Carl Icahn,

2794
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:55,380
who had probably a $20 billion net worth at the time

2795
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:56,730
this was nothing.

2796
01:48:56,730 --> 01:48:57,563
But to me it was like,

2797
01:48:57,563 --> 01:48:59,903
okay, this is my investor's money, I'm gonna get it back.

2798
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:03,573
And so eventually we won.

2799
01:49:04,590 --> 01:49:05,490
Eventually he paid

2800
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:07,670
and then he called me,

2801
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:10,060
he said, "Bill, congratulations

2802
01:49:11,077 --> 01:49:14,497
"now we can be friends and we can invest,

2803
01:49:14,497 --> 01:49:15,870
"do some investing together".

2804
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:18,057
I'm like, "Carl, fuck you".

2805
01:49:18,057 --> 01:49:19,823
- You actually said fuck you?

2806
01:49:19,823 --> 01:49:20,656
- (laughs) Yes.

2807
01:49:20,656 --> 01:49:21,840
And I'm not that kind of person generally,

2808
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:26,730
but you know, he made eight years to pay me,

2809
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:29,250
not me, even me, my investors money they owed.

2810
01:49:29,250 --> 01:49:33,600
And so he probably didn't like that.

2811
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,000
So he kind of hung around in the weeds

2812
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,380
waiting for an opportunity.

2813
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:39,180
And then from there I started Pershing.

2814
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:41,145
We had to kind of straight line up,

2815
01:49:41,145 --> 01:49:42,390
we were up the first 12 years

2816
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:44,040
we could do nothing wrong,

2817
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:49,020
then Valiant, Herbalife, right?

2818
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:51,993
He sees an opportunity and he buys the stock.

2819
01:49:52,950 --> 01:49:55,200
He figures he is gonna run me off the road.

2820
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:57,030
And so that was the beginning of that.

2821
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:58,740
And kind of the moment,

2822
01:49:58,740 --> 01:49:59,970
and I think it's the,

2823
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:03,870
I'm told by CNBC, it's the most watched segment

2824
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:05,420
in business television history.

2825
01:50:06,780 --> 01:50:07,613
They're interviewing me

2826
01:50:07,613 --> 01:50:09,810
about the Herbalife investment on CNBC.

2827
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:11,770
And then Carl Icahn calls into the show

2828
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:15,690
and we have kind of a interesting conversation

2829
01:50:15,690 --> 01:50:17,280
where he calls me all kinds of names and stuff.

2830
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,310
So it was a moment, it was a moment in my life.

2831
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:21,630
- It wasn't public information

2832
01:50:21,630 --> 01:50:24,090
that he was long on Herbalife.

2833
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:27,150
- He didn't yet disclose he had a stake.

2834
01:50:27,150 --> 01:50:27,990
But he was just telling me

2835
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:30,270
how stupid I was to be short this company.

2836
01:50:30,270 --> 01:50:32,430
- So for him, it wasn't about

2837
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:33,690
the fundamentals of the company,

2838
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:36,180
it was about, it was just personal.

2839
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:37,710
- [Bill] 100%.

2840
01:50:37,710 --> 01:50:40,800
- Is there a part of you that regrets saying

2841
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,580
fuck you on that phone call to Carl Icahn?

2842
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:45,490
- No.

2843
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:47,730
(both laughing)

2844
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:50,700
I generally have no regrets

2845
01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:53,310
because I'm very happy with where I am now.

2846
01:50:53,310 --> 01:50:56,397
And I feel like it's a bit like

2847
01:50:56,397 --> 01:50:58,500
you step on the butterfly in the forest

2848
01:50:58,500 --> 01:51:00,270
and the world changes because you know,

2849
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:02,790
every action has a reaction.

2850
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:04,290
You know if you're happy with who you are,

2851
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:06,660
where you are in life, every decision you've made,

2852
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:07,980
good or bad over the course of your life

2853
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:09,120
got you to precisely where you are.

2854
01:51:09,120 --> 01:51:10,770
I wouldn't change anything.

2855
01:51:10,770 --> 01:51:12,720
- He said, you lost money on Herbalife.

2856
01:51:13,800 --> 01:51:16,140
So he did the long-term battle.

2857
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:19,710
- What he did is he got on the board of the company

2858
01:51:19,710 --> 01:51:21,540
and used the company's financial resources

2859
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:26,540
plus his stake in the business to squeeze us.

2860
01:51:26,731 --> 01:51:28,260
And a squeeze in short selling

2861
01:51:28,260 --> 01:51:31,410
is where you restrict the supply of the securities

2862
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:33,780
so that there's a scarcity.

2863
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:35,730
And then you encourage people to buy the stock

2864
01:51:35,730 --> 01:51:37,410
and you drive the stock up.

2865
01:51:37,410 --> 01:51:38,280
And as I explained before,

2866
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:41,070
you short those coins at 10, they go to 100,

2867
01:51:41,070 --> 01:51:43,320
you can lose theoretically an unlimited amount of money.

2868
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,150
And that's scary.

2869
01:51:45,150 --> 01:51:47,730
That's why we don't short stocks.

2870
01:51:47,730 --> 01:51:50,130
That's why I didn't short stocks before this.

2871
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:51,570
But this was, unfortunately

2872
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:53,160
I had to have the personal lesson.

2873
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:55,350
- So how much was for him personal

2874
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:59,460
versus part of sort of the game of investing?

2875
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:01,680
- Well, he thought he could make money doing this.

2876
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:03,540
He wouldn't have done it if he did otherwise.

2877
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,550
He thought his bully pulpit,

2878
01:52:05,550 --> 01:52:07,170
his ability to create a short squeeze,

2879
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:08,570
his control over the company

2880
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,436
would enable him to achieve this.

2881
01:52:11,436 --> 01:52:14,130
And he made a billion, we lost a billion.

2882
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:16,500
- So you think it was a financial decision outta personal?

2883
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:18,690
- It was a personal decision to pursue it.

2884
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:19,950
But he was waiting for an opportunity

2885
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:21,180
where he could make money at our expense.

2886
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:23,430
And it was kind of a brilliant opportunity for him.

2887
01:52:23,430 --> 01:52:25,620
Now the irony is, well first of all,

2888
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:28,170
the FTC found a few interesting facts.

2889
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:30,690
So one, the government launched an investigation,

2890
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:31,673
they ended up settling with the company

2891
01:52:31,673 --> 01:52:35,343
and the company paid $220 million in fines.

2892
01:52:36,270 --> 01:52:39,930
I met a professor from Berkeley a couple years ago

2893
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:43,110
who told me that he had been hired by the government

2894
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:45,057
as their expert on Herbalife.

2895
01:52:45,057 --> 01:52:46,830
And he got access to all their data,

2896
01:52:46,830 --> 01:52:49,200
was able to prove that they're a pyramid scheme

2897
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,140
but the government ultimately settled with Carl

2898
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:53,340
'cause they were afraid

2899
01:52:53,340 --> 01:52:55,530
they could possibly lose in court

2900
01:52:55,530 --> 01:52:56,780
so they settled with him.

2901
01:52:57,630 --> 01:52:59,130
But if you look at the stock,

2902
01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:01,230
if we'd been able to stay short the entire time,

2903
01:53:01,230 --> 01:53:03,312
we would've made a bunch of money.

2904
01:53:03,312 --> 01:53:04,800
'cause the stock had a $6 billion market cap

2905
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,753
and we shorted it today as probably a billion,

2906
01:53:07,753 --> 01:53:08,850
a billion and a half.

2907
01:53:08,850 --> 01:53:12,000
- So you left the short or whatever that's called--

2908
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,010
- Covered. We closed it out.

2909
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:16,950
well we sold Valiant, we covered Herbalife.

2910
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:19,050
That was the resetting moment for the firm.

2911
01:53:19,050 --> 01:53:21,540
'Cause it would just psychologically,

2912
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:23,460
and you know, the beauty of investing

2913
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:25,770
is you don't need to make it back the way you lost it

2914
01:53:25,770 --> 01:53:27,690
you can just take your loss,

2915
01:53:27,690 --> 01:53:28,860
by the way, losses are valuable

2916
01:53:28,860 --> 01:53:31,590
and that the government allows you to take a tax loss

2917
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:32,880
and that can shelter other gains.

2918
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:35,280
And we just refocused,

2919
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:38,490
- Can you say one thing you really like about Carl Icahn

2920
01:53:38,490 --> 01:53:40,890
and one thing you really don't like about him?

2921
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:44,370
- Sure. So he's a very charming guy.

2922
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:48,450
So in the midst of all this at the Hall Wood one,

2923
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:50,010
he took me out for dinner

2924
01:53:50,010 --> 01:53:51,450
to his favorite Italian restaurant.

2925
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:52,283
- [Lex] Really?

2926
01:53:52,283 --> 01:53:54,090
- Yeah. We were in the middle of the litigation

2927
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:55,560
to see if he could resolve it.

2928
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,010
And he offered 10 million in my favorite charity.

2929
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:00,677
The problem was that it wasn't my money,

2930
01:54:00,677 --> 01:54:02,070
it was my investors' money

2931
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:04,743
so I couldn't settle with him on that basis.

2932
01:54:05,940 --> 01:54:10,110
But I had the chance to spend real time with him at dinner.

2933
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:12,690
He's funny, he's charismatic,

2934
01:54:12,690 --> 01:54:14,090
he's got incredible stories.

2935
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:17,400
And you know, actually I made peace with him over time.

2936
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,040
We had a little hug out on CNBC

2937
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,650
even had him to my house, believe it or not.

2938
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:25,710
I hosted something called the Finance Cup,

2939
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:28,980
which is a tennis tournament between people in finance

2940
01:54:28,980 --> 01:54:32,760
and Europe and the US and we had the event at my house

2941
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:35,250
and one guy thought to invite Carl Icahn.

2942
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:37,890
And so we had Carl Icahn on there to present awards.

2943
01:54:37,890 --> 01:54:40,803
And again, I have to say I kinda liked the guy,

2944
01:54:43,110 --> 01:54:45,903
but I didn't like him much during this.

2945
01:54:47,670 --> 01:54:49,560
- Because at least from the outsider perspective,

2946
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:52,120
there's a bit of a personal vengeance here

2947
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:55,530
or anger can build up.

2948
01:54:55,530 --> 01:54:57,540
Do you ever worry the personal attacks

2949
01:54:57,540 --> 01:55:01,250
between powerful investors can cloud your judgment

2950
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:04,020
of what is the right financial decision?

2951
01:55:04,020 --> 01:55:05,130
- I think it's possible, but again,

2952
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:07,260
I try to be extremely economically rational.

2953
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:11,040
And actually the last seven years have been quite peaceful.

2954
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,590
I really have not been an activist

2955
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:17,970
in the old form for many years.

2956
01:55:17,970 --> 01:55:19,740
And the vast majority

2957
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:21,840
of even our activist investments historically

2958
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,290
were very polite, respectful cases.

2959
01:55:25,290 --> 01:55:28,020
The press of course focuses on the more interesting ones.

2960
01:55:28,020 --> 01:55:31,470
Like Chipotle was one of the best investments we ever made.

2961
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:34,980
We got four of eight board seats

2962
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:36,328
and we worked with management

2963
01:55:36,328 --> 01:55:37,885
and it was a great outcome.

2964
01:55:37,885 --> 01:55:39,150
I don't think there's ever ever been a story about it.

2965
01:55:39,150 --> 01:55:40,800
And the stock's up

2966
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,940
almost 10 times from the time we hired Brian Nichols, CEO.

2967
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:47,880
But it's not interesting because there was no battle.

2968
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,640
Whereas Herbalife, of course, was like an epic battle,

2969
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:52,350
even Canadian Pacific.

2970
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:54,420
So for a period there, you most people,

2971
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,488
when they meet me in person,

2972
01:55:55,488 --> 01:55:57,666
they're like, wow, Bill, you seem like a really nice guy.

2973
01:55:57,666 --> 01:56:00,450
But I thought, you know, so,

2974
01:56:00,450 --> 01:56:01,620
but things have been pretty calm

2975
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:03,570
for the last seven years.

2976
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:06,990
- Of course there's more than just investing

2977
01:56:06,990 --> 01:56:09,693
that your life is about, especially recently.

2978
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:13,290
Lemme just ask you about what's going on in the world.

2979
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:17,490
First, what was your reaction

2980
01:56:17,490 --> 01:56:19,470
and what is your reaction

2981
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,110
and thoughts with respect

2982
01:56:22,110 --> 01:56:26,523
to the October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel?

2983
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:29,700
- You know, it's a sad world that we live in.

2984
01:56:29,700 --> 01:56:32,040
That one we have terrorists

2985
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:36,270
and two that we can have such barbaric terrorism

2986
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:38,160
and yeah, just a reminder of that.

2987
01:56:38,160 --> 01:56:40,140
- So there's several things I can ask here.

2988
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:43,830
First on the, your views on the prospects

2989
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:48,060
of the Middle East, but also on the reaction to

2990
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:51,600
this war and in the United States,

2991
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:54,090
especially on university campuses.

2992
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:55,380
So first lemme just ask,

2993
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,870
you've said that you're pro-Palestinian.

2994
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:59,940
Can you explain what you mean by that?

2995
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:03,270
- You know, with all of my posts about Israel,

2996
01:57:03,270 --> 01:57:06,690
I'm obviously very supportive of the country of Israel.

2997
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:07,710
Israel's right to exist,

2998
01:57:07,710 --> 01:57:09,310
Israel's right to defend itself.

2999
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:13,920
My Arab friends, my Palestinian friends

3000
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,047
were kind of saying, "Hey Bill, where are you?"

3001
01:57:16,047 --> 01:57:18,693
You know, what about Palestinian lives?

3002
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:23,280
And I was pretty early in my life,

3003
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:24,930
a guy named Marty Parrott, who's been important to me

3004
01:57:24,930 --> 01:57:26,280
over the course of my life, a professor,

3005
01:57:26,280 --> 01:57:29,133
or first investor in my fund introduced me to Neri,

3006
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:32,768
asked me when I right outta school

3007
01:57:32,768 --> 01:57:35,400
to join this nonprofit called the Jerusalem Foundation,

3008
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,830
which was a charitable foundation

3009
01:57:37,830 --> 01:57:41,070
that supported Teddy Collick when he was mayor of Jerusalem.

3010
01:57:41,070 --> 01:57:42,480
I ended up becoming the youngest chairman

3011
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:43,437
of the Jerusalem Foundation in my 30s

3012
01:57:43,437 --> 01:57:45,690
and I spent some time in Israel.

3013
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:49,320
And the early philanthropic stuff I did

3014
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:50,633
with the Jerusalem Foundation,

3015
01:57:50,633 --> 01:57:53,940
I thing I was most interested in was kind of

3016
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:56,430
the Palestinian, the plight of the Palestinians

3017
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:58,830
and kind of peaceful coexistence.

3018
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:01,973
And so I had kind of an early kind of perspective,

3019
01:58:01,973 --> 01:58:03,510
as chairman of the Jerusalem Foundation

3020
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:06,210
I would go into Arab communities

3021
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:08,608
and I would meet the families in their homes.

3022
01:58:08,608 --> 01:58:11,250
You know, you get a sense of the humanity

3023
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:14,400
of a people and I care about humanity.

3024
01:58:14,400 --> 01:58:16,920
I generally take the side of people

3025
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,220
who've been disadvantaged.

3026
01:58:19,620 --> 01:58:21,420
Almost all of our philanthropic work

3027
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:23,820
has been in that capacity,

3028
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:27,033
so that's sort of my natural perspective.

3029
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:30,700
But I don't take the side of terrorists ever, obviously.

3030
01:58:31,657 --> 01:58:34,530
And the whole thing is just a tragedy.

3031
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:37,980
- So to you, this is about Hamas, not about Palestine?

3032
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:42,980
- Yes. I mean the problem of course is when Hamas controls

3033
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:47,260
for the last almost 20 years, has controlled Gaza

3034
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:50,640
including the education system,

3035
01:58:50,640 --> 01:58:53,160
they're educating, you know, you see these

3036
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:57,300
training videos of kindergartners indoctrinating them

3037
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:59,853
into hating Jews and Israel.

3038
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,430
And of course you don't like to see

3039
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:07,650
Palestinians celebrating some of those early videos

3040
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:11,070
of October 7th with dead buddies in the back of trucks

3041
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:14,040
and people cheering.

3042
01:59:14,040 --> 01:59:16,350
So it's a really unfortunate situation.

3043
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:20,550
But I think about a Palestinian life is important

3044
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:24,450
and as valuable as a Jewish life, as a American life.

3045
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:27,093
And you know, what do people really want?

3046
01:59:28,049 --> 01:59:29,849
They want a place, they want a home.

3047
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,340
They wanna be able to feed their family.

3048
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:35,430
They want a job that generates

3049
01:59:35,430 --> 01:59:36,780
the resources to feed their family.

3050
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:40,110
They want their kids to have a better life than they've had.

3051
01:59:40,110 --> 01:59:41,310
They want peace.

3052
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:43,350
I think these are basic human things.

3053
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:44,790
I'm sure the vast majority

3054
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:47,310
of Palestinians share these views,

3055
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:51,060
but it's such an embedded situation with hatred

3056
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:53,760
and as I say, indoctrination.

3057
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,770
And then, you know, going back to incentives

3058
01:59:55,770 --> 01:59:59,640
terrorists generate their resources by committing terrorism,

3059
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:01,950
and that's how they get funding.

3060
02:00:01,950 --> 02:00:04,013
And there's a lot of graft.

3061
02:00:05,366 --> 02:00:07,620
You know, it's a plutocracy, right?

3062
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:10,020
The top of the terrorist pyramid

3063
02:00:10,020 --> 02:00:12,420
if you accept the numbers that are in the press,

3064
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:15,090
the top leaders have billions of dollars.

3065
02:00:15,090 --> 02:00:17,470
You know, 40 billion or so has gone into Gaza

3066
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:21,630
and the West Bank over the last 30 years,

3067
02:00:21,630 --> 02:00:23,280
a number like that.

3068
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,380
And a lot of it's disappeared

3069
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:30,380
into some combination of corruption or tunnels or weapons.

3070
02:00:31,110 --> 02:00:32,280
And the tragedy is

3071
02:00:32,280 --> 02:00:34,950
you look at what Singapore has achieved

3072
02:00:34,950 --> 02:00:37,410
in the last 30 years, right?

3073
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:38,820
- Do you think that's still possible

3074
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:42,720
if we look into the future of 10, 20, 50 years from now?

3075
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:43,680
- Absolutely.

3076
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,410
- [Lex] So not just peace but--

3077
02:00:46,410 --> 02:00:47,943
- Peace comes with prosperity.

3078
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:53,670
You know, people are under the leadership of terrorists,

3079
02:00:53,670 --> 02:00:55,260
you're not gonna have prosperity

3080
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:56,850
and you're not gonna have peace.

3081
02:00:56,850 --> 02:01:01,500
And I think the Israelis withdrew in 2005

3082
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,020
and fairly quickly Hamas took control of the situation

3083
02:01:04,020 --> 02:01:06,173
that should never have been allowed to happen.

3084
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:11,170
If you think about I have the opportunity to spend

3085
02:01:12,150 --> 02:01:14,460
call it an hour with Henry Kissinger,

3086
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:17,040
a few months before he passed away,

3087
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:19,830
we were talking about Gaza

3088
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:21,000
or in the early stage of the war.

3089
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,850
He said, look, you know, this is not,

3090
02:01:24,267 --> 02:01:28,050
you could think about Gaza as a test

3091
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:29,100
of a two state solution.

3092
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:30,450
It's not looking good.

3093
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:32,130
These were his words.

3094
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:33,340
So the next time round

3095
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:38,310
the Palestinian people should have their own state,

3096
02:01:38,310 --> 02:01:42,390
but it can't be a state where 40 billion resources goes in

3097
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:44,730
and is spent on weaponry and missiles

3098
02:01:44,730 --> 02:01:47,460
and rockets going into Israel.

3099
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:52,460
And I do think a consortium of the Gulf States,

3100
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:55,290
the Saudis and others have to ultimately

3101
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:58,020
oversee the governance of this region.

3102
02:01:58,020 --> 02:01:59,610
I think if that can happen,

3103
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:00,720
I think you can have peace,

3104
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:01,923
you can have prosperity.

3105
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:06,240
And I'm fundamentally an optimist.

3106
02:02:06,240 --> 02:02:09,510
- So a coalition of governance.

3107
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:10,680
- [Bill] Governance matters, you know,

3108
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:13,260
going back to what we talked about before.

3109
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:16,950
- And you know that kind of approach

3110
02:02:16,950 --> 02:02:18,990
can give the people a chance to--

3111
02:02:18,990 --> 02:02:20,640
- a hundred percent - Flourish.

3112
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:21,473
- A hundred percent.

3113
02:02:21,473 --> 02:02:23,910
I mean, look at what Dubai has accomplished

3114
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:27,540
with nomads in the desert, right?

3115
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,550
And that's become a major,

3116
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:31,470
it's a tourist destination.

3117
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:33,620
Gaza could have been a tourist destination.

3118
02:02:34,890 --> 02:02:37,510
- Take me through the saga of university presidents

3119
02:02:38,460 --> 02:02:43,460
testifying on the topic of protests on college campuses,

3120
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:47,430
protests that call for the genocide of Jewish people

3121
02:02:47,430 --> 02:02:50,133
and the university presidents,

3122
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:54,630
maybe you could describe it more precisely,

3123
02:02:54,630 --> 02:02:59,630
but they fail to denounce the calls for genocide.

3124
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:05,073
- So it begins on October 8th, probably.

3125
02:03:06,180 --> 02:03:10,740
And you can do a compare and contrast with

3126
02:03:10,740 --> 02:03:13,827
how Dartmouth managed the events of October 7th

3127
02:03:13,827 --> 02:03:16,053
and the aftermath and how Harvard did.

3128
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:20,673
And on October 8th or shortly thereafter,

3129
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:22,890
the Dartmouth president,

3130
02:03:22,890 --> 02:03:24,540
who had been in her job for precisely

3131
02:03:24,540 --> 02:03:26,280
the same number of months

3132
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:28,560
that the Harvard president had been in her job,

3133
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,660
the first thing she did is she got

3134
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:33,960
the most important professors of Middle East studies

3135
02:03:33,960 --> 02:03:36,363
who were Arab and who were Jews.

3136
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:38,980
And they convened them

3137
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:44,640
and held an open session Q&A for students

3138
02:03:44,640 --> 02:03:46,860
to talk about what's going on in the Middle East,

3139
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:50,370
and began an opportunity for common understanding

3140
02:03:50,370 --> 02:03:52,020
among the student body.

3141
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:55,920
And Dartmouth has been a relatively benign environment

3142
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:00,920
on this issue, and students are able to do work.

3143
02:04:01,260 --> 02:04:03,060
And there aren't disruptive protests

3144
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:05,760
with people with bullhorns walking into classrooms

3145
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,270
interfering with, you know, people pay today $82,000 a year,

3146
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:11,700
which itself is crazy to go to Harvard.

3147
02:04:11,700 --> 02:04:14,370
But imagine your family borrows the money

3148
02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:16,560
or you borrow the money as a student,

3149
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:19,620
and your learning is disrupted by constant protest

3150
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:21,060
and the university does nothing.

3151
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:22,720
You know, when George Floyd died

3152
02:04:23,580 --> 02:04:27,630
the Harvard president wrote a very strong letter

3153
02:04:27,630 --> 02:04:29,700
denouncing what had taken place

3154
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:33,720
and calling this an important moment in American history

3155
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:36,063
and took it incredibly seriously.

3156
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,540
Her first letter about October 7th was not that,

3157
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:41,070
let's put it that way.

3158
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:43,710
And then her second letter was not that.

3159
02:04:43,710 --> 02:04:46,560
And then ultimately she was sort of forced

3160
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:48,390
by the board or the pressure

3161
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:51,063
to make a more public statement,

3162
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,940
but it was clear that it was hard for her

3163
02:04:53,940 --> 02:04:58,380
to come to an understanding of this terrorist act.

3164
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:00,660
And then the protests erupted on campus

3165
02:05:00,660 --> 02:05:02,910
and they started out recently benign.

3166
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:04,650
And then the protesters

3167
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:06,540
got more and more aggressive in terms of

3168
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:10,800
violating university rules on things like bullying

3169
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,630
and the university did nothing.

3170
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:15,030
And that obviously for the Jewish students,

3171
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:18,960
the Israeli students, the Israeli faculty, Jewish faculty,

3172
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:21,510
created an incredibly uncomfortable environment.

3173
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:24,690
And the President seemed indifferent.

3174
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:26,607
And I went up to campus

3175
02:05:26,607 --> 02:05:29,070
and I met with hundreds of students

3176
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:30,750
in small groups, in larger groups.

3177
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:31,583
And they're like,

3178
02:05:31,583 --> 02:05:33,277
"Bill, why is the president doing nothing?

3179
02:05:33,277 --> 02:05:35,790
"Why is the administration doing nothing?"

3180
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:37,200
And that was really the beginning.

3181
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:39,570
And I reached out to the president,

3182
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:42,210
reached out to the board of Harvard,

3183
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:45,150
I said, look, this thing is headed in the wrong direction

3184
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:46,950
and you need to fix it.

3185
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:49,743
And I have some ideas, love to share.

3186
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:54,570
And I got the Heisman, as they say,

3187
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:56,820
they just kept pushing off the opportunity for me

3188
02:05:56,820 --> 02:06:01,623
to meet with the president and meet with the board.

3189
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,770
And a certain point in time I pushed,

3190
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:08,400
you know, I'm kind of an activist when you push me,

3191
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:11,400
it reminded me of early days of activism

3192
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:13,860
where I couldn't get the CEO of Wendy's

3193
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:14,743
to return my call.

3194
02:06:14,743 --> 02:06:19,350
I couldn't get the CEO of Harvard to take a meeting.

3195
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:21,360
And then finally I spoke to the chairman of the board,

3196
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,160
a woman by the name of Penny Pritzker,

3197
02:06:23,160 --> 02:06:27,333
who I knew from on a business school, a board with her.

3198
02:06:28,230 --> 02:06:29,490
And it was, as I described,

3199
02:06:29,490 --> 02:06:31,167
one of the more disappointing conversations in my life.

3200
02:06:31,167 --> 02:06:33,930
And it did not seem, she seemed a bit like,

3201
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:35,790
if you will, deer in the headlights.

3202
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:38,790
They couldn't do this, they couldn't do that.

3203
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:41,850
The law was preventing them from doing various things.

3204
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:44,490
And that led to my first letter to the university.

3205
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:46,233
And I sort of ended the letter,

3206
02:06:47,212 --> 02:06:49,230
sort of giving this president of Harvard

3207
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:50,063
a dared to be great speech.

3208
02:06:50,063 --> 02:06:51,370
This is your opportunity

3209
02:06:52,230 --> 02:06:56,643
you can fix this, this could be your legacy.

3210
02:06:59,370 --> 02:07:00,690
I emailed it to the president

3211
02:07:00,690 --> 02:07:03,900
and the board members whose email addresses I had,

3212
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:06,480
I posted it on Twitter.

3213
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:09,480
I got no response, no acknowledgement, nothing.

3214
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:12,420
And in fact the open dialogue I had

3215
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:13,470
with a couple of people on the board

3216
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:16,020
basically got shut down after that.

3217
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:17,720
And that led to letter number two,

3218
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,530
and then when the Congress led by Elise Stefanik

3219
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:28,800
announced an investigation of antisemitism on campus

3220
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:32,283
and concern about violations of law.

3221
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:35,760
The president was called to testify along with two other,

3222
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,067
the president of MIT,

3223
02:07:37,067 --> 02:07:40,290
the president of University of Pennsylvania

3224
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:43,350
were having similar issues on campus.

3225
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:45,000
I reached out to the president of Harvard

3226
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,250
and said, well, one, the Israeli government

3227
02:07:47,250 --> 02:07:48,330
had gotten in touch

3228
02:07:48,330 --> 02:07:51,990
and offered the opportunity for me to see the Hamas,

3229
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:53,880
if you will, GoPro film.

3230
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:55,830
And I said, you know what, I'd love to show it at Harvard.

3231
02:07:55,830 --> 02:07:57,720
And they thought that would be a great idea.

3232
02:07:57,720 --> 02:08:00,503
And so I partnered with the head of Harvard Habad,

3233
02:08:01,954 --> 02:08:03,870
a guy named Rabbi Hershey,

3234
02:08:03,870 --> 02:08:06,327
and we were putting the film up on campus

3235
02:08:06,327 --> 02:08:08,420
and I thought if the president were to see this

3236
02:08:08,420 --> 02:08:10,440
it would give her a lot of perspective on what happened,

3237
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:13,170
and she should see it before her testimony.

3238
02:08:13,170 --> 02:08:14,370
And so I reached out to her,

3239
02:08:14,370 --> 02:08:17,820
or actually Rabbi Hershey did.

3240
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:20,620
And he was told she'd be out of town

3241
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:23,070
and couldn't see it.

3242
02:08:23,070 --> 02:08:24,840
And then I reached out to her again,

3243
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:29,767
said, look, I'll facilitate your attendance in the Congress,

3244
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:32,850
come see the film, I'll fly you down.

3245
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:34,380
That was rejected.

3246
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,583
And then she testified.

3247
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:38,940
And I watched a good percentage,

3248
02:08:38,940 --> 02:08:41,700
80% of the testimony of all three presidents

3249
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:44,550
and it was an embarrassment to the country,

3250
02:08:44,550 --> 02:08:46,500
embarrassment to the universities,

3251
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:47,550
they were evasive,

3252
02:08:47,550 --> 02:08:48,780
they didn't answer questions,

3253
02:08:48,780 --> 02:08:50,820
they were rude, they smirked,

3254
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:55,713
you know, they looked very disrespectful to our Congress.

3255
02:08:57,120 --> 02:08:59,850
And then of course there was that several minutes

3256
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:01,170
where finally at least Stefanik

3257
02:09:01,170 --> 02:09:02,970
was not getting answers to her questions.

3258
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:06,753
And she said, you know, let me be kind of clear,

3259
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:10,800
what if protestors are calling for genocide for the Jews

3260
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,910
does that violate your rules on bullying and harassment?

3261
02:09:14,910 --> 02:09:16,890
And the three of them basically gave the same answer.

3262
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:18,810
You know, it depends on the context

3263
02:09:18,810 --> 02:09:23,660
and not until they actually executed on the genocide

3264
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:26,160
to the university have the right to intervene.

3265
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:28,020
And the thing that perhaps bothered me the most

3266
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:29,470
was the incredible hypocrisy,

3267
02:09:30,450 --> 02:09:33,030
Harvard was, you know, each of these universities

3268
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:35,640
are ranked by this entity called FIRE,

3269
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,760
which is a nonprofit that focuses on free speech on campus.

3270
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:42,150
And Harvard, it's been in the bottom quartile

3271
02:09:42,150 --> 02:09:44,820
for the last five years and dropped to last

3272
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:47,323
before October 7th, out of like 250.

3273
02:09:47,323 --> 02:09:48,420
- I should mention briefly

3274
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:50,130
that I've interviewed on this podcast,

3275
02:09:50,130 --> 02:09:52,710
the founder of FIRE and the current Head of FIRE.

3276
02:09:52,710 --> 02:09:54,990
We discussed this at length,

3277
02:09:54,990 --> 02:09:57,720
including running for the board of Harvard

3278
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:59,370
and the whole procedure of all that,

3279
02:09:59,370 --> 02:10:03,997
it's quite a fascinating investigation of free speech

3280
02:10:03,997 --> 02:10:06,630
for people who care about free speech absolutism,

3281
02:10:06,630 --> 02:10:08,640
that's a good episode to listen to

3282
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:11,490
because those folks kind of fight for this idea.

3283
02:10:11,490 --> 02:10:15,150
It's a difficult idea actually to internalize

3284
02:10:15,150 --> 02:10:17,820
what does free speech in college campuses look like.

3285
02:10:17,820 --> 02:10:19,530
- Harvard has become a place where

3286
02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:21,270
free speech is not tolerated on campus,

3287
02:10:21,270 --> 02:10:23,340
or at least free speech

3288
02:10:23,340 --> 02:10:26,010
that's not part of the accepted dialogue.

3289
02:10:26,010 --> 02:10:29,670
Or, you know, this whole notion of speech codes

3290
02:10:29,670 --> 02:10:32,850
and microaggressions really emerged on the elite,

3291
02:10:32,850 --> 02:10:36,839
the Harvard, Yale campuses of the world

3292
02:10:36,839 --> 02:10:39,573
and the president of Harvard's,

3293
02:10:40,410 --> 02:10:42,760
then president of Harvard's explanation for why

3294
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:45,030
you could call for the genocide

3295
02:10:45,030 --> 02:10:46,230
of the Jewish people on campus

3296
02:10:46,230 --> 02:10:49,140
was Harvard's commitment to free expression.

3297
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:51,960
And you know, one of the more hypocritical statements

3298
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:55,080
of all time, and you really can't have it both ways either.

3299
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:56,910
Harvard has to be a place where it's a free speech.

3300
02:10:56,910 --> 02:10:59,490
She basically said, we're a free speech absolutist place,

3301
02:10:59,490 --> 02:11:01,620
which is why we have to allow this.

3302
02:11:01,620 --> 02:11:04,170
And Harvard could not be further from that.

3303
02:11:04,170 --> 02:11:07,200
And so that was a big part of it.

3304
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:10,590
And I was in the barber chair, if you will,

3305
02:11:10,590 --> 02:11:12,000
getting haircut.

3306
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,100
And I had a guy on my team

3307
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:16,170
send me the three minute section.

3308
02:11:16,170 --> 02:11:19,650
I said, cut that line of questioning.

3309
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:22,290
And I put out a little tweet on that

3310
02:11:22,290 --> 02:11:26,160
and I call it my greatest hits of posts.

3311
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:28,710
It's got something 110 million views.

3312
02:11:28,710 --> 02:11:31,560
And everyone looked at this and said,

3313
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:34,420
what is wrong with university campuses

3314
02:11:36,090 --> 02:11:39,000
and their leadership and their governance by the way.

3315
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,410
You know, in a way this whole conversation's

3316
02:11:40,410 --> 02:11:41,940
been about governance.

3317
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:44,490
Harvard has disastrous governance structure,

3318
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:46,290
which is why we have the problem we have.

3319
02:11:46,290 --> 02:11:50,250
- And just to linger on the testimony

3320
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:52,947
and you mentioned smirks and this kind of stuff

3321
02:11:52,947 --> 02:11:55,770
and you mentioned dare to be great,

3322
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:59,340
I myself am kind of a sucker for great leadership.

3323
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:02,850
And those moments, you mentioned Churchill or so on,

3324
02:12:02,850 --> 02:12:04,890
even great speeches,

3325
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:08,910
people talk down on speeches like it's maybe just words,

3326
02:12:08,910 --> 02:12:13,410
but I think speeches can define a culture

3327
02:12:13,410 --> 02:12:18,150
and define a place, define a people that can inspire.

3328
02:12:18,150 --> 02:12:21,420
And I think actually the testimony before Congress

3329
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:26,420
could have been an opportunity to redefine what Harvard is,

3330
02:12:26,580 --> 02:12:28,380
dare to be great for,

3331
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:30,000
dare to be a great leader.

3332
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,830
- President of Harvard had a huge opportunity

3333
02:12:31,830 --> 02:12:33,480
'cause she went third, right?

3334
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:36,180
The first two gave the world's most disastrous answers

3335
02:12:36,180 --> 02:12:39,720
to the question and she literally just copied their answer,

3336
02:12:39,720 --> 02:12:43,950
which is itself kind of ironic

3337
02:12:43,950 --> 02:12:45,840
in light of ultimately what happened.

3338
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:50,840
- It's tough because you can get busy as a president,

3339
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:52,200
as a leader and so on.

3340
02:12:52,200 --> 02:12:53,033
There's these meetings.

3341
02:12:53,033 --> 02:12:54,270
And so you think congress,

3342
02:12:54,270 --> 02:12:57,180
maybe you're smirking at the ridiculousness of the meeting.

3343
02:12:57,180 --> 02:13:02,180
You need to remember that many of these are opportunities

3344
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:05,438
to like give a speech of a lifetime.

3345
02:13:05,438 --> 02:13:08,973
If there is principles which you want to see

3346
02:13:08,973 --> 02:13:12,450
an institution become and embody

3347
02:13:12,450 --> 02:13:14,460
in the next several decades,

3348
02:13:14,460 --> 02:13:16,410
there's opportunities to do that.

3349
02:13:16,410 --> 02:13:19,410
And you as a great leader also need to have a sense

3350
02:13:19,410 --> 02:13:21,870
of when is the opportunity to do that.

3351
02:13:21,870 --> 02:13:24,490
And October 7th really woke up the world

3352
02:13:25,958 --> 02:13:28,020
on all sides, honestly.

3353
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:31,890
Like there is serious issue going on here.

3354
02:13:31,890 --> 02:13:35,250
And then the protests woke up the university,

3355
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:37,680
there's a serious issue going on here.

3356
02:13:37,680 --> 02:13:40,980
It's an opportunity to speak on free speech

3357
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:43,113
and on genocide, both.

3358
02:13:45,660 --> 02:13:50,350
Do you see the criticism that you are a billionaire donor

3359
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:53,250
and you sort of used your power

3360
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:56,370
and financial influence unfairly to affect

3361
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:59,070
the governing structure of Harvard in this case?

3362
02:13:59,070 --> 02:14:00,480
- First of all I never threatened

3363
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,280
to use financial other resources.

3364
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:03,930
The only thing I did here was wrote.

3365
02:14:03,930 --> 02:14:05,670
I wrote public letters,

3366
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:08,340
I spoke privately to a couple members of the board.

3367
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:10,740
I spoke for 45 minutes to the chairman.

3368
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:12,630
None of those conversations were effective

3369
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,820
or went anywhere as far as I could tell.

3370
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:17,940
I think my public letters

3371
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:19,990
and then some of the posts, I did tweets.

3372
02:14:21,097 --> 02:14:26,097
That little three minute video excerpt had an impact,

3373
02:14:27,842 --> 02:14:30,510
but it wasn't about, I mean you can criticize me

3374
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:32,220
for being a billionaire, but that had,

3375
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:34,560
you know, it was really the words.

3376
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,950
It's a bit like, again, going back to the corporate analogy,

3377
02:14:37,950 --> 02:14:39,990
it's not the fact that you own 5% of the company

3378
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:42,210
that causes people to vote in your favor,

3379
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:44,520
it's the fact that your ideas are right.

3380
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:47,430
And I think I was disappointed

3381
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:48,660
after the congressional testimony.

3382
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:49,680
The board of Harvard said that

3383
02:14:49,680 --> 02:14:51,870
they were 100% behind unanimously,

3384
02:14:51,870 --> 02:14:54,630
100% behind President Gay.

3385
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:56,970
And so clearly I was ineffective.

3386
02:14:56,970 --> 02:15:01,260
And ultimately what took her down was other,

3387
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:03,600
I would say activists who identified issues

3388
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:06,060
with academic integrity.

3389
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:08,100
And then she lost the confidence of the faculty.

3390
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:11,250
And once that happens, it's hard to stay.

3391
02:15:11,250 --> 02:15:14,130
And I wanted her to be fired basically,

3392
02:15:14,130 --> 02:15:17,670
or be forced to resign because of failures of leadership.

3393
02:15:17,670 --> 02:15:19,500
'Cause that would've sent a message about the importance

3394
02:15:19,500 --> 02:15:22,530
of leadership, you know, failure to stop a emergence

3395
02:15:22,530 --> 02:15:24,210
of antisemitism on campus.

3396
02:15:24,210 --> 02:15:26,220
And you know, there's some news today

3397
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:28,140
the protests are getting worse.

3398
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:29,160
- Is there some tension

3399
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:31,470
between free speech on college campuses

3400
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:34,740
and disciplining students for calls of genocide?

3401
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:36,900
- Yes, there's certainly a tension.

3402
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:39,690
And I think first of all,

3403
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:42,150
I think free speech is incredibly important.

3404
02:15:42,150 --> 02:15:43,620
I'm a lot closer to absolutism

3405
02:15:43,620 --> 02:15:45,630
on free speech than otherwise.

3406
02:15:45,630 --> 02:15:48,090
The issue I had was the hypocrisy, right?

3407
02:15:48,090 --> 02:15:52,380
They were restricting other kinds of speech on campus,

3408
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:54,980
principally conservative speech, conservative views.

3409
02:15:55,830 --> 02:15:59,010
So it wasn't a free speech absolutist campus

3410
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,990
and the protests were actually

3411
02:16:00,990 --> 02:16:02,610
quite threatening to students.

3412
02:16:02,610 --> 02:16:05,790
And there are limits to even absolutist free speech.

3413
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:09,690
And they begin where people feel intimidation,

3414
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:14,690
harassment and threat to bodily harm, et cetera.

3415
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:17,310
You know, that kind of speech is generally,

3416
02:16:17,310 --> 02:16:19,230
and again, it's pretty technical,

3417
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:21,360
but as people feel like they're in imminent harm

3418
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,550
by virtue of the protest, that speech is at risk

3419
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:26,460
of not meeting the standards for free speech.

3420
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:28,980
But Harvard is a private corporation

3421
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:30,720
and as a private corporation,

3422
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:32,370
they can put on what restrictions they want.

3423
02:16:32,370 --> 02:16:34,740
And Harvard had introduced only a few months before

3424
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,750
bullying and harassment policies.

3425
02:16:36,750 --> 02:16:39,809
And that's why Representative Stefanik focused on

3426
02:16:39,809 --> 02:16:40,643
it's not like she said

3427
02:16:40,643 --> 02:16:42,240
this calling for genocide against the Jews

3428
02:16:42,240 --> 02:16:43,559
violate your free speech policies,

3429
02:16:43,559 --> 02:16:46,110
she says it's calling for genocide against the Jews,

3430
02:16:46,110 --> 02:16:48,959
violate your policies on bullying harassment.

3431
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:50,520
And I think everyone looked at this

3432
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:52,110
when they said it depends on the context.

3433
02:16:52,110 --> 02:16:53,459
And they said, look, if you replaced Jews

3434
02:16:53,459 --> 02:16:54,959
with some other ethnic group,

3435
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:58,049
students have been, who've used the N word, for example,

3436
02:16:58,049 --> 02:17:01,290
have been thrown off campus, were suspended.

3437
02:17:01,290 --> 02:17:06,290
Students who've hate speech directed at LGBTQ people

3438
02:17:06,959 --> 02:17:09,420
has led to disciplinary action.

3439
02:17:09,420 --> 02:17:13,410
But attacking, spitting on Jewish students

3440
02:17:13,410 --> 02:17:15,610
or you know, kind of roughing them up a bit,

3441
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:20,879
seemed like we're calling for their elimination

3442
02:17:20,879 --> 02:17:22,580
didn't seem to violate the policy.

3443
02:17:24,299 --> 02:17:26,340
I think a university should be a place

3444
02:17:26,340 --> 02:17:29,070
where you have broad views and open viewpoints

3445
02:17:29,070 --> 02:17:30,272
and broad discussion,

3446
02:17:31,709 --> 02:17:32,580
but it should also be a place

3447
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:34,980
where students don't feel threatened going to class,

3448
02:17:34,980 --> 02:17:37,200
where their learning is not interrupted,

3449
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:39,540
when final exams are not interrupted

3450
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:42,990
by people coming in and with loud protests.

3451
02:17:42,990 --> 02:17:44,670
Students asked me when I went up there,

3452
02:17:44,670 --> 02:17:45,690
what would you do if you're a Harvard president?

3453
02:17:45,690 --> 02:17:46,889
I said, and this was before I knew

3454
02:17:46,889 --> 02:17:48,209
what was happening on the Dartmouth campus.

3455
02:17:48,209 --> 02:17:50,370
I said, I would convene everyone together.

3456
02:17:50,370 --> 02:17:51,240
This is Harvard.

3457
02:17:51,240 --> 02:17:53,190
We have access to the best minds in the world.

3458
02:17:53,190 --> 02:17:55,260
Let's have a better understanding of the history.

3459
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:58,290
Let's understand the backdrop, let's focus on solutions.

3460
02:17:58,290 --> 02:17:59,790
Let's bring Arab and Jewish

3461
02:17:59,790 --> 02:18:00,959
and Israeli students together.

3462
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:03,750
Let's form groups to create communication.

3463
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:05,969
That's how you solve this kind of problem.

3464
02:18:05,969 --> 02:18:07,980
And none of this stuff has been done.

3465
02:18:07,980 --> 02:18:09,270
It's not that hard.

3466
02:18:09,270 --> 02:18:12,790
- Do you think this reveals a deeper problem

3467
02:18:14,129 --> 02:18:16,320
in terms of ideology

3468
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:18,070
and the governance of Harvard

3469
02:18:20,490 --> 02:18:22,770
maybe the culture of Harvard?

3470
02:18:22,770 --> 02:18:24,750
- Yes. So on governance,

3471
02:18:24,750 --> 02:18:26,520
the governance structure is a disaster.

3472
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,510
So the way it works today

3473
02:18:27,510 --> 02:18:29,459
is Harvard has two principal boards.

3474
02:18:29,459 --> 02:18:31,110
There's the board of the corporation,

3475
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:33,150
the so-called fellows of Harvard.

3476
02:18:33,150 --> 02:18:36,059
It's a board of I think 12 independent directors.

3477
02:18:36,059 --> 02:18:39,959
And the president, there's no shareholder vote,

3478
02:18:39,959 --> 02:18:41,670
there's no proxy system.

3479
02:18:41,670 --> 02:18:44,820
It's really a self perpetuating board that

3480
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:47,070
its effectively elects its own members.

3481
02:18:47,070 --> 02:18:51,782
So once the balance tips politically one way or another,

3482
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:55,590
it can be kept that way forever.

3483
02:18:55,590 --> 02:18:57,330
There's no kind of rebalancing system.

3484
02:18:57,330 --> 02:18:59,309
You know, if a US corporation goes off the rails

3485
02:18:59,309 --> 02:19:01,590
so to speak, the shareholders can get together

3486
02:19:01,590 --> 02:19:02,730
and vote off the directors.

3487
02:19:02,730 --> 02:19:04,889
There's no ability to vote off the directors.

3488
02:19:04,889 --> 02:19:06,059
Then there's the board of Overseers,

3489
02:19:06,059 --> 02:19:09,059
which is I think 32 directors.

3490
02:19:09,059 --> 02:19:11,190
And there a few years ago

3491
02:19:11,190 --> 02:19:13,170
if you could put together 600 signatures,

3492
02:19:13,170 --> 02:19:14,280
you could run for that board

3493
02:19:14,280 --> 02:19:15,840
and put up a bunch of candidates

3494
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:18,360
and about five or six get elected each year.

3495
02:19:18,360 --> 02:19:20,790
And a group did exactly that.

3496
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:24,990
And it was an oil and gas kind of disinvestment group.

3497
02:19:24,990 --> 02:19:25,823
They got the signatures,

3498
02:19:25,823 --> 02:19:27,180
a couple of 'em got elected

3499
02:19:27,180 --> 02:19:29,730
and Harvard then changed the rules

3500
02:19:29,730 --> 02:19:33,360
and they said, now we need 3,200 signatures.

3501
02:19:33,360 --> 02:19:36,990
And by the way if there are these

3502
02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:38,430
dissident directors on the board,

3503
02:19:38,430 --> 02:19:39,540
we're only gonna allow,

3504
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:41,309
we're gonna cap them at five.

3505
02:19:41,309 --> 02:19:43,889
So if three were elected in the oil and gas thing,

3506
02:19:43,889 --> 02:19:46,080
now they're only two seats available.

3507
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:50,160
And then a group of former students, kind of younger alums,

3508
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:51,390
one of whom I knew, approached me

3509
02:19:51,390 --> 02:19:53,280
and said, look Bill, we should run for the board.

3510
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,500
And they decided this pretty late,

3511
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:58,200
only a few weeks before the signatures were due.

3512
02:19:58,200 --> 02:19:59,503
And love your support.

3513
02:19:59,503 --> 02:20:00,750
I took a look at their platform,

3514
02:20:00,750 --> 02:20:01,620
I thought it looked great.

3515
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:03,330
I said, look, happy to support.

3516
02:20:03,330 --> 02:20:04,830
And I posted about them,

3517
02:20:04,830 --> 02:20:06,810
you know, did a Zoom with them

3518
02:20:06,810 --> 02:20:08,700
and they got thousands of signatures,

3519
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:10,040
collectively the four got whatever,

3520
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:12,360
12,000 signatures or something like this.

3521
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:16,440
And they missed by about 10% the threshold.

3522
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:18,600
And what did Harvard do in the middle of the election?

3523
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:23,310
They made it very, very difficult to sign up for a vote.

3524
02:20:23,310 --> 02:20:25,080
And it just makes them look terrible.

3525
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:29,220
And they've got now thousands of alums upset

3526
02:20:29,220 --> 02:20:30,750
and again, this wasn't an election,

3527
02:20:30,750 --> 02:20:32,970
this was just to put the names on the slate.

3528
02:20:32,970 --> 02:20:34,470
So the only candidates on the slate

3529
02:20:34,470 --> 02:20:38,550
are the ones selected by the existing members.

3530
02:20:38,550 --> 02:20:43,200
And so it's businesses fail

3531
02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:44,823
because of governance failures.

3532
02:20:46,170 --> 02:20:48,150
Universities fail because of governance failures.

3533
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:50,070
It's not really the president's fault

3534
02:20:50,070 --> 02:20:51,900
because the job of the board

3535
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:54,270
is to hire and fire the president

3536
02:20:54,270 --> 02:20:57,120
and help guide the institution academically, otherwise.

3537
02:20:57,120 --> 02:20:58,050
So that's governance.

3538
02:20:58,050 --> 02:21:01,530
And ideology, I was like, how can this be.

3539
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:04,020
October 7th, the event that woke me up

3540
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:06,210
was 30 student organizations came out

3541
02:21:06,210 --> 02:21:08,340
with a public letter on October 8th,

3542
02:21:08,340 --> 02:21:10,320
literally the morning after this letter was created

3543
02:21:10,320 --> 02:21:14,790
and said, Israel is solely responsible

3544
02:21:14,790 --> 02:21:16,593
for Hamas' violent acts.

3545
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:20,370
Again, Israel had not even mounted a defense at this point

3546
02:21:20,370 --> 02:21:22,230
and there were still terrorists running around

3547
02:21:22,230 --> 02:21:23,780
in the southern part of Israel.

3548
02:21:25,356 --> 02:21:28,950
And I'm like, Harvard students,

3549
02:21:28,950 --> 02:21:32,733
34 Harvard student organizations signed this letter.

3550
02:21:33,690 --> 02:21:35,190
And I'm like, what is going on?

3551
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:36,783
You know, WTF, right?

3552
02:21:37,650 --> 02:21:40,707
And that's when I went up on campus

3553
02:21:40,707 --> 02:21:43,080
and I started talking to the faculty.

3554
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:45,330
And that's when I started hearing about actually Bill,

3555
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:47,580
it's this DEI ideology.

3556
02:21:47,580 --> 02:21:52,580
I'm like, what like diversity, equity, inclusion.

3557
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:56,130
Obviously I'm familiar with these words

3558
02:21:56,130 --> 02:21:59,097
and you know, I see this in the corporate context

3559
02:21:59,097 --> 02:21:59,930
and they say, yeah.

3560
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:00,840
And they started talking to me about

3561
02:22:00,840 --> 02:22:04,680
this oppressor oppressed framework,

3562
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:08,220
which is effectively taught on campus

3563
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:09,870
and represents the backdrop

3564
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:11,340
for many of the courses that are offered

3565
02:22:11,340 --> 02:22:14,880
and the various, some of the studies

3566
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:16,500
and other degree offerings.

3567
02:22:16,500 --> 02:22:19,830
I'm like, I had not even heard of this.

3568
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:22,560
And you know, I'm a pretty aware person,

3569
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:23,850
but I was completely unaware.

3570
02:22:23,850 --> 02:22:24,870
And basically they're like,

3571
02:22:24,870 --> 02:22:26,860
look, Israel is deemed an oppressor

3572
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:30,150
and the Palestinians are deemed the oppressed.

3573
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:32,880
And you take the side of the oppressed

3574
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:35,190
and any acts of the oppressed

3575
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:37,230
to dislodge the oppressor

3576
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:40,353
regardless of how vile or barbaric parquet.

3577
02:22:41,580 --> 02:22:44,520
I'm like, okay, this is a super dangerous ideology.

3578
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:48,330
And so I wrote like, questioning post about this,

3579
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:50,220
like, here's what I'm hearing,

3580
02:22:50,220 --> 02:22:51,540
is this right?

3581
02:22:51,540 --> 02:22:54,570
Then I had someone, a friend of mine sent me

3582
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:57,840
a Christopher Rufos book, "America's Cultural Revolution"

3583
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:01,080
which is sort of a sociological study

3584
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:02,970
of the origins of the DEI movement

3585
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:04,980
and critical race theory.

3586
02:23:04,980 --> 02:23:07,200
And I found it actually

3587
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,510
one of the more important books I've read

3588
02:23:09,510 --> 02:23:13,230
and also found it quite concerning

3589
02:23:13,230 --> 02:23:16,500
and really it's sort of ultimately DEI

3590
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:19,150
comes out of a kind of a Marxist

3591
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:24,060
socialist backdrop way to look at the world.

3592
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:26,070
And so I think there are a lot of issues with it,

3593
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:27,960
but it unfortunately it's advancing.

3594
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:32,000
I ultimately concluded racism

3595
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,050
as opposed to fighting it,

3596
02:23:34,050 --> 02:23:37,020
which is what I thought it was ultimately about.

3597
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:39,240
- So maybe you can speak to that book a little bit.

3598
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:43,480
So there's a history that traces back across decades

3599
02:23:45,210 --> 02:23:47,820
and then that infiltrated college campuses.

3600
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:49,950
- So basically what Rufo argues

3601
02:23:49,950 --> 02:23:54,270
is that the black power movement of the '60s really failed.

3602
02:23:54,270 --> 02:23:55,950
It was a very violent movement

3603
02:23:55,950 --> 02:23:59,280
and many of the protagonists ended up in jail

3604
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,753
and out of that movement,

3605
02:24:01,753 --> 02:24:04,683
a number of kind of thought leaders,

3606
02:24:05,700 --> 02:24:07,830
this guy named Mark Esques

3607
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:12,330
and others built this framework kind of an approach,

3608
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:14,160
look, if we're gonna be successful

3609
02:24:14,160 --> 02:24:16,560
can't be a violent movement, number one.

3610
02:24:16,560 --> 02:24:18,690
Number two, we need to infiltrate, if you will,

3611
02:24:18,690 --> 02:24:23,070
the universities and we need to become part of the faculty

3612
02:24:23,070 --> 02:24:26,100
and we need to teach the students.

3613
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:29,130
And then once we take over the universities

3614
02:24:29,130 --> 02:24:32,490
with this ideology, then we can go into government

3615
02:24:32,490 --> 02:24:34,230
and then we can go into corporations

3616
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:35,640
and we can change the world.

3617
02:24:35,640 --> 02:24:37,140
So, and I thought important book,

3618
02:24:37,140 --> 02:24:39,480
and the more I dug in

3619
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:42,420
the more I felt there was credibility to this,

3620
02:24:42,420 --> 02:24:45,720
not just the kind of sociological backdrop,

3621
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:49,380
but to what it meant on campus and faculty,

3622
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:51,840
Harvard faculty were telling me that

3623
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:54,870
there's really is no such thing as free speech on campus.

3624
02:24:54,870 --> 02:24:57,420
And that there was a survey done,

3625
02:24:57,420 --> 02:24:59,400
I dunno, a year or so ago of the Harvard faculty

3626
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:02,190
and only 2% of the faculty admitted,

3627
02:25:02,190 --> 02:25:04,680
even in an anonymous survey admitted to being,

3628
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:06,990
having a conservative point of view.

3629
02:25:06,990 --> 02:25:09,693
So we have a campus that's 98% non-conservative,

3630
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:11,650
liberal progressive

3631
02:25:13,350 --> 02:25:17,490
that's adopted this DEI construct and this,

3632
02:25:17,490 --> 02:25:20,250
and then I learned from a member of the search committee

3633
02:25:20,250 --> 02:25:21,500
for the Harvard president

3634
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:25,440
that they were restricted in looking at candidates

3635
02:25:25,440 --> 02:25:28,440
only those who met the DEI offices criteria.

3636
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:30,930
And I shared this in one of my postings

3637
02:25:30,930 --> 02:25:32,730
and I was accused of being a racist,

3638
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:39,960
and that's someone who believes in a diversity

3639
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:42,030
is a very good thing for organizations

3640
02:25:42,030 --> 02:25:44,520
and that equity fairness isn't really important.

3641
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:47,940
And having an inclusive culture is critical

3642
02:25:47,940 --> 02:25:50,100
for a functioning of organization.

3643
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:52,170
So here I was someone who was like,

3644
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:54,227
okay, DEI, sounds good to me,

3645
02:25:54,227 --> 02:25:59,227
at least in the small D, small EI version of events.

3646
02:26:00,210 --> 02:26:02,610
But this DEIO ideology is really problematic.

3647
02:26:02,610 --> 02:26:06,783
- So what's a way to fix this in the next few years?

3648
02:26:08,790 --> 02:26:13,260
The infiltration of DEI with the uppercase version

3649
02:26:13,260 --> 02:26:16,353
of universities and the things that have troubled you,

3650
02:26:17,490 --> 02:26:20,100
the things you saw at Harvard and elsewhere,

3651
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:22,410
- The same way this was an eye-opening event for me

3652
02:26:22,410 --> 02:26:24,900
it has been for a very broad range of other people.

3653
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:26,610
I've never gotten...

3654
02:26:26,610 --> 02:26:27,570
I mentioned general growth,

3655
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:28,770
I got a lot of nice letters from people

3656
02:26:28,770 --> 02:26:31,283
for making money on a stock that went up a hundred times.

3657
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:37,400
But I literally get hundreds of emails, letters,

3658
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:39,180
texts, handwritten letters,

3659
02:26:39,180 --> 02:26:43,770
type letters from people the ages of 25 to 85 saying,

3660
02:26:43,770 --> 02:26:45,240
Bill, this is so important.

3661
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:46,980
Thanks for speaking out on this.

3662
02:26:46,980 --> 02:26:49,710
You were saying what so many of us believe

3663
02:26:49,710 --> 02:26:51,810
but have been afraid to say.

3664
02:26:51,810 --> 02:26:54,960
I described it as almost a McCarthy esque kind of movement

3665
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:58,380
and that if you challenge the DEI construct

3666
02:26:58,380 --> 02:26:59,610
people accuse you of being racist.

3667
02:26:59,610 --> 02:27:01,010
It's happened to me already.

3668
02:27:04,945 --> 02:27:06,720
I'm much less vulnerable than a university professor

3669
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:10,590
who can get shouted off campus, canceled.

3670
02:27:10,590 --> 02:27:12,543
I'm sort of difficult to cancel.

3671
02:27:13,740 --> 02:27:15,653
But that doesn't mean people aren't gonna try.

3672
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:19,530
I've been the victim of a couple of

3673
02:27:19,530 --> 02:27:22,650
interesting articles in the last few days,

3674
02:27:22,650 --> 02:27:25,620
or at least one in particular in the Washington Post

3675
02:27:25,620 --> 02:27:27,660
written by what I thought was a well-meaning reporter.

3676
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:29,370
But it's just clear that

3677
02:27:29,370 --> 02:27:31,530
I've taken on some big parts

3678
02:27:31,530 --> 02:27:34,303
of at least the progressive establishment,

3679
02:27:34,303 --> 02:27:37,230
DEI I'm also a believer that Biden

3680
02:27:37,230 --> 02:27:38,670
should have stepped aside a long time ago.

3681
02:27:38,670 --> 02:27:41,478
And it's only getting worse.

3682
02:27:41,478 --> 02:27:44,733
You know, so I'm attacking the president, DEI,

3683
02:27:46,230 --> 02:27:51,230
elite universities and you make some enemies doing that.

3684
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:53,190
- But I should say,

3685
02:27:53,190 --> 02:27:55,560
I'm still at MIT and I love MIT

3686
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:59,290
and I believe in the power of great universities

3687
02:28:00,150 --> 02:28:04,503
to explore ideas, to inspire young people to think,

3688
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:08,040
to inspire young people to lead.

3689
02:28:08,040 --> 02:28:11,520
- Let me ask, okay, how can you explore

3690
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:14,760
how to think when you're only shared

3691
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:17,250
a certain point of view, right?

3692
02:28:17,250 --> 02:28:19,290
How can you learn about leadership

3693
02:28:19,290 --> 02:28:22,830
when the governance and leadership of the institution

3694
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:26,400
is broken and exposure to ideas if you're limited

3695
02:28:26,400 --> 02:28:28,080
in the ideas that you're exposed to.

3696
02:28:28,080 --> 02:28:29,220
So I think university is at risk.

3697
02:28:29,220 --> 02:28:31,410
I mean, the concerning thing

3698
02:28:31,410 --> 02:28:34,080
is if 34 student organizations that each have,

3699
02:28:34,080 --> 02:28:36,657
I don't know, 30 members or maybe more, right?

3700
02:28:36,657 --> 02:28:38,100
That's a thousand, okay?

3701
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:41,700
That's a meaningful percentage of the campus perhaps

3702
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:42,900
that ultimately respond.

3703
02:28:42,900 --> 02:28:46,020
Now, a 10 or so of the 30 withdrew the statement

3704
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:50,210
once many of the members realized what they had written.

3705
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:52,410
So I don't think it seems like the statement

3706
02:28:52,410 --> 02:28:54,060
was signed by the leadership

3707
02:28:54,060 --> 02:28:55,110
and not necessarily supported

3708
02:28:55,110 --> 02:28:59,370
by all the various students that were members.

3709
02:28:59,370 --> 02:29:03,630
But if the university teaches people these precepts,

3710
02:29:03,630 --> 02:29:04,860
this is the next generation of leader.

3711
02:29:04,860 --> 02:29:07,003
You know, normally if you think about,

3712
02:29:07,003 --> 02:29:09,900
I wrote my college thesis on university admissions.

3713
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:11,740
The reason why controlling

3714
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:16,110
the gates of the Harvard Institution,

3715
02:29:16,110 --> 02:29:17,640
the admissions office is important isn't

3716
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:19,650
that many of these people who graduate end up with,

3717
02:29:19,650 --> 02:29:22,420
you know, the top jobs in government

3718
02:29:23,430 --> 02:29:26,310
and ultimately become judges,

3719
02:29:26,310 --> 02:29:29,730
they permeate through society.

3720
02:29:29,730 --> 02:29:31,380
And so it really matters what they learn.

3721
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:34,787
And if they're limited to one side

3722
02:29:34,787 --> 02:29:36,930
of the political aisle

3723
02:29:36,930 --> 02:29:40,830
and they're not open to a broad array of views

3724
02:29:40,830 --> 02:29:42,180
and this represents some of the most

3725
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:44,190
elite institutions in our country,

3726
02:29:44,190 --> 02:29:47,220
I think it's very problematic for the country long term.

3727
02:29:47,220 --> 02:29:48,930
- Yeah, I 100% agree.

3728
02:29:48,930 --> 02:29:53,917
And I also felt like the leadership wasn't even

3729
02:29:55,230 --> 02:29:57,450
part of the problem as much as they were almost out

3730
02:29:57,450 --> 02:30:00,280
of touch, like unaware

3731
02:30:01,710 --> 02:30:04,290
that this is an important moment,

3732
02:30:04,290 --> 02:30:05,790
it is an important crisis.

3733
02:30:05,790 --> 02:30:09,180
It's an important opportunity to step up as a leader

3734
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:11,280
and define the future of an institution.

3735
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:13,680
So I don't even know where the source of the problem is.

3736
02:30:13,680 --> 02:30:17,550
It could be literally governance structure

3737
02:30:17,550 --> 02:30:18,450
as we've been talking about.

3738
02:30:18,450 --> 02:30:19,283
- Well, it's two things.

3739
02:30:19,283 --> 02:30:20,520
I think it's governance structure.

3740
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:24,663
I also think universities they're not selecting leaders.

3741
02:30:26,160 --> 02:30:29,500
You know, it's not clear to me that

3742
02:30:31,290 --> 02:30:34,683
universities should necessarily be run by academics.

3743
02:30:36,300 --> 02:30:38,913
The dean of a university,

3744
02:30:40,500 --> 02:30:41,853
the person who helps,

3745
02:30:44,340 --> 02:30:46,860
there's sort of the business of the university

3746
02:30:46,860 --> 02:30:49,350
and then there's the academics of the university

3747
02:30:49,350 --> 02:30:53,250
and having I would argue having a business leader

3748
02:30:53,250 --> 02:30:55,350
run these institutions

3749
02:30:55,350 --> 02:30:56,830
and then having a board

3750
02:30:58,800 --> 02:31:01,200
that has itself diverse viewpoints

3751
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,150
and by the way, permanently structured

3752
02:31:03,150 --> 02:31:04,540
to have diverse viewpoints

3753
02:31:05,940 --> 02:31:07,530
is a much better way to run a university

3754
02:31:07,530 --> 02:31:10,560
than picking an academic that the faculty supports.

3755
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:12,480
'Cause you know, one of the things I learned about

3756
02:31:12,480 --> 02:31:14,040
how faculty get hired at universities,

3757
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:17,400
ultimately it's signed off by the board,

3758
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:20,400
but the new faculty are chosen

3759
02:31:20,400 --> 02:31:22,320
by each of the various departments.

3760
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:25,350
And once the departments tip,

3761
02:31:25,350 --> 02:31:26,880
there's sort of a tipping point politically

3762
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:29,550
where if once they tip in one direction,

3763
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:33,300
the faculty recruit more people like themselves.

3764
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:36,720
And so the departments come more and more progressive,

3765
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:38,130
if you will, with the passage of time

3766
02:31:38,130 --> 02:31:39,730
and they only advance candidates

3767
02:31:42,089 --> 02:31:43,020
that meet their political objectives.

3768
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:44,040
It's not a great way

3769
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:48,570
to build an institution which allows for--

3770
02:31:48,570 --> 02:31:50,310
- Small D diversity

3771
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:53,040
- Allows for, yeah, diversity.

3772
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,850
And diversity by the way, is not just race and gender.

3773
02:31:56,850 --> 02:31:59,500
And that's also something I feel very strongly about.

3774
02:32:00,390 --> 02:32:02,700
- Well, luckily engineering robotics

3775
02:32:02,700 --> 02:32:04,140
is touched last by this.

3776
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:05,733
It is touched, but you know,

3777
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:10,620
when I am at the computing building

3778
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:12,870
starter and the new one

3779
02:32:12,870 --> 02:32:14,370
politics doesn't infiltrate

3780
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:15,990
or I haven't seen it infiltrate quite

3781
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:17,490
as deep place elsewhere.

3782
02:32:17,490 --> 02:32:19,890
- It's in the biology department at Harvard.

3783
02:32:19,890 --> 02:32:22,248
'Cause the biology is controversial now.

3784
02:32:22,248 --> 02:32:23,160
- [Lex] Yes, yes,

3785
02:32:23,160 --> 02:32:26,760
- 'Cause biology and gender there are faculty,

3786
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:28,020
there's a woman at Harvard

3787
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:31,350
who was literally canceled from the faculty as a member.

3788
02:32:31,350 --> 02:32:33,000
I think she was at the med school

3789
02:32:34,050 --> 02:32:38,280
and she made the argument that there are basically

3790
02:32:38,280 --> 02:32:40,800
two genders determined by biology.

3791
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:42,150
She wasn't allowed to stay.

3792
02:32:44,280 --> 02:32:45,832
That's another topic for another time.

3793
02:32:45,832 --> 02:32:47,490
- That's another topic.

3794
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:49,020
- You should do a show on that one.

3795
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:50,910
That'd be an interesting one.

3796
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:53,790
- So as you said, technically Claudine Gay,

3797
02:32:53,790 --> 02:32:58,110
the president of Harvard resigned over plagiarism,

3798
02:32:58,110 --> 02:33:01,650
not over the thing that you were initially troubled by.

3799
02:33:01,650 --> 02:33:03,540
- It's hard to really know, right?

3800
02:33:03,540 --> 02:33:05,220
It's not like provable fact,

3801
02:33:05,220 --> 02:33:06,450
I would say at a certain point in time

3802
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:08,730
she lost the confidence of the faculty

3803
02:33:08,730 --> 02:33:10,410
and that was ultimately the catalyst.

3804
02:33:10,410 --> 02:33:11,940
And whether that was,

3805
02:33:11,940 --> 02:33:14,097
how much of that was the plagiarism issue

3806
02:33:14,097 --> 02:33:15,279
and how much of that was

3807
02:33:15,279 --> 02:33:16,500
some of the things that preceded it,

3808
02:33:16,500 --> 02:33:19,110
or was it all of these issues in their entirety?

3809
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:21,240
There's no way to do a calculus.

3810
02:33:21,240 --> 02:33:22,440
- Can you explain the nature of this

3811
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:25,140
plagiarism from what you remember?

3812
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:28,140
- So Aaron Sibarium and Christopher Rufo,

3813
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:30,600
one from the free beacon and Chris,

3814
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:32,280
surfaced some allegations

3815
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:35,370
or identified some plagiarism in the issues

3816
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:37,863
that I would say the initial examples were,

3817
02:33:39,780 --> 02:33:42,570
use of the same words with proper attribution,

3818
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:45,270
some missing footnotes.

3819
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:49,410
And then over time with I guess more digging,

3820
02:33:49,410 --> 02:33:52,440
they released I think ultimately something like

3821
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:57,440
76 examples of what they call plagiarism

3822
02:33:57,780 --> 02:34:01,530
in I think eight of 11 of her articles.

3823
02:34:01,530 --> 02:34:03,930
And one of the other things that came forth here

3824
02:34:03,930 --> 02:34:06,210
is as president of university,

3825
02:34:06,210 --> 02:34:08,610
she had sort of the thinnest transcript academically

3826
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:10,500
of any previous president.

3827
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:12,957
You know, very small, relatively small body of work.

3828
02:34:12,957 --> 02:34:14,070
And then when you couple that

3829
02:34:14,070 --> 02:34:16,680
with the amount of plagiarism that was pervasive.

3830
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:19,020
And then I guess some of the other examples

3831
02:34:19,020 --> 02:34:20,700
that surfaced were not missing quotation marks

3832
02:34:20,700 --> 02:34:23,820
where the authors of the work felt

3833
02:34:23,820 --> 02:34:26,400
that their ideas had been stolen.

3834
02:34:26,400 --> 02:34:28,773
And really plagiarism is academic fraud.

3835
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:33,180
One indicia plagiarism is a missing footnote

3836
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:35,100
that could also be a clerical error.

3837
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:39,570
And so when a professor's accused of plagiarism

3838
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:41,100
university does sort of a deep dive.

3839
02:34:41,100 --> 02:34:43,860
They have these administrative boards

3840
02:34:43,860 --> 02:34:45,630
and it can take six months,

3841
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:47,650
nine months, a year to evaluate

3842
02:34:49,290 --> 02:34:52,230
intent matters with this intentional theft

3843
02:34:52,230 --> 02:34:55,110
of another person's idea that's academic fraud.

3844
02:34:55,110 --> 02:34:56,580
Or was this sloppy,

3845
02:34:56,580 --> 02:34:59,760
you missed, or just humanity, right?

3846
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:01,290
You miss a footnote here or there.

3847
02:35:01,290 --> 02:35:05,910
And I think once it got to a place where people felt

3848
02:35:05,910 --> 02:35:09,780
it was theft of someone else's intellectual property,

3849
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:12,000
that's when it became intolerable

3850
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,920
for her to stay as president of Harvard.

3851
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:17,010
- So is there a spectrum for you between

3852
02:35:17,010 --> 02:35:19,290
different kinds of plagiarism,

3853
02:35:19,290 --> 02:35:24,290
maybe plagiarizing words and plagiarizing ideas

3854
02:35:24,480 --> 02:35:28,590
and plagiarizing novel ideas?

3855
02:35:28,590 --> 02:35:31,341
- Of course, the common understanding of plagiarism,

3856
02:35:31,341 --> 02:35:34,233
if you look in the dictionary, it's about theft.

3857
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:37,773
Theft requires a intent.

3858
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:40,050
Did the person intentionally

3859
02:35:40,050 --> 02:35:43,020
take someone else's ideas or words?

3860
02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:45,813
Now if you're writing a novel,

3861
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:48,390
words matter more, right?

3862
02:35:48,390 --> 02:35:49,860
If you're taking Shakespeare

3863
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:52,170
and presenting it as your own words,

3864
02:35:52,170 --> 02:35:56,190
if you're writing about ideas,

3865
02:35:56,190 --> 02:35:57,450
ideas matter, but you're not supposed

3866
02:35:57,450 --> 02:35:58,620
to take someone else's words

3867
02:35:58,620 --> 02:36:01,080
without properly acknowledging them,

3868
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:03,840
whether it's quotation marks or otherwise.

3869
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:06,990
But in the context of academic's life's work

3870
02:36:06,990 --> 02:36:11,280
before AI, everyone's gonna have

3871
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:14,130
missing quotation marks and footnotes.

3872
02:36:14,130 --> 02:36:15,780
I remember writing my own thesis,

3873
02:36:18,010 --> 02:36:20,250
there were books you couldn't take out a Widener library.

3874
02:36:20,250 --> 02:36:23,730
So I'd have index cards and I'd write stuff on index cards

3875
02:36:23,730 --> 02:36:25,830
and I'd put a little citation to make sure

3876
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:27,960
I remember to cite it properly.

3877
02:36:27,960 --> 02:36:30,600
And you know, scrambling to do your thesis,

3878
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:34,080
get it in on time, what's the chances you forget

3879
02:36:34,080 --> 02:36:36,780
at what point what are your words versus the author's words

3880
02:36:36,780 --> 02:36:38,940
and you forget to put quotation marks.

3881
02:36:38,940 --> 02:36:42,870
Just the humanity, you know, the human fallibility of it.

3882
02:36:42,870 --> 02:36:45,840
So it's not academic fraud

3883
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:48,180
to have human fail ability,

3884
02:36:48,180 --> 02:36:49,080
but it's academic fraud

3885
02:36:49,080 --> 02:36:50,790
if you take someone else's ideas

3886
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:53,550
that are an integral part of your work.

3887
02:36:53,550 --> 02:36:56,550
- Is there a part of you that regrets that,

3888
02:36:56,550 --> 02:36:58,830
at least from the perception of it

3889
02:36:58,830 --> 02:37:01,740
the president Harvard stepped on over plagiarism

3890
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:05,760
versus over refusing to say that

3891
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:09,090
the calls for genocide are wrong?

3892
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:12,010
- Again, I think it would've sent a better message

3893
02:37:13,470 --> 02:37:15,880
if a leader fails as a leader

3894
02:37:16,890 --> 02:37:20,460
and that's the reason for their resignation or dismissal,

3895
02:37:20,460 --> 02:37:22,260
then she gets, if you will,

3896
02:37:22,260 --> 02:37:24,300
caught on a technical violation

3897
02:37:24,300 --> 02:37:26,400
that had nothing to do with failed leadership.

3898
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:28,260
Because I don't know

3899
02:37:28,260 --> 02:37:31,650
what's lesson that teaches the board

3900
02:37:31,650 --> 02:37:32,880
about selecting the next candidate.

3901
02:37:32,880 --> 02:37:34,560
I mean the future of Harvard

3902
02:37:34,560 --> 02:37:36,180
a lot of it's gonna depend on who they pick

3903
02:37:36,180 --> 02:37:37,983
as the next leader.

3904
02:37:38,910 --> 02:37:40,690
Here's an interesting anecdote

3905
02:37:41,910 --> 02:37:44,640
that I think is not surfaced publicly.

3906
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:46,620
So a guy named Larry Backhoe

3907
02:37:46,620 --> 02:37:48,630
was the previous president of Harvard.

3908
02:37:48,630 --> 02:37:50,580
Larry Backhoe was on the search committee

3909
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:53,790
and they were looking for a new president.

3910
02:37:53,790 --> 02:37:57,430
And what was strange was they picked an old white guy

3911
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:01,140
to be president of Harvard when there was

3912
02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:03,153
a call for a more diverse president.

3913
02:38:04,110 --> 02:38:07,953
And what I learned was Harvard actually ran a process,

3914
02:38:09,060 --> 02:38:11,403
had a diverse new president of Harvard.

3915
02:38:12,510 --> 02:38:14,400
And in the due diligence on that candidate,

3916
02:38:14,400 --> 02:38:17,370
shortly before the announcement of the new president,

3917
02:38:17,370 --> 02:38:19,890
they found out that that presidential candidate

3918
02:38:19,890 --> 02:38:21,140
had a plagiarism problem.

3919
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:23,910
And the search had gone on long enough,

3920
02:38:23,910 --> 02:38:26,820
they couldn't restart a search to find another candidate.

3921
02:38:26,820 --> 02:38:29,370
So they pick Larry Backhoe off the board,

3922
02:38:29,370 --> 02:38:32,130
off the search committee to the next president of Harvard

3923
02:38:32,130 --> 02:38:33,693
as kind of an interim solution.

3924
02:38:34,770 --> 02:38:37,260
And then there was that much more pressure

3925
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,750
to have a more diverse candidate this time around.

3926
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:42,270
'Cause there was a big disappointment to the DEI office,

3927
02:38:42,270 --> 02:38:44,670
if you will, and I would say to the community at large

3928
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:48,190
that the Harvard of all places couldn't have

3929
02:38:48,190 --> 02:38:50,400
a racially diverse president,

3930
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:51,850
it sent an important message.

3931
02:38:53,550 --> 02:38:58,550
So the strange thing is that they didn't do due diligence

3932
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:03,390
on President Gay and that it was a relatively quick process.

3933
02:39:03,390 --> 02:39:08,370
So the whole thing I think is worthy of further exploration.

3934
02:39:08,370 --> 02:39:10,860
- So this goes deeper than just the president.

3935
02:39:10,860 --> 02:39:11,733
- Yeah, for sure.

3936
02:39:12,690 --> 02:39:13,920
When a company fails,

3937
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:15,243
most people blame the CEO,

3938
02:39:16,110 --> 02:39:18,300
I generally blame the board, right?

3939
02:39:18,300 --> 02:39:19,890
'Cause the board's job is to make sure

3940
02:39:19,890 --> 02:39:21,120
the right person's running the company

3941
02:39:21,120 --> 02:39:23,130
and if they're failing, help the person.

3942
02:39:23,130 --> 02:39:25,830
If they can't help the person make a change.

3943
02:39:25,830 --> 02:39:27,240
That's not what's happened here.

3944
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:30,300
The board's hand was sort of forced from the outside,

3945
02:39:30,300 --> 02:39:31,133
whereas they should have made

3946
02:39:31,133 --> 02:39:32,984
their own decision from the inside.

3947
02:39:32,984 --> 02:39:34,560
- Do you still love Harvard?

3948
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:39,420
- Sure, it's a 400 odd year institution.

3949
02:39:39,420 --> 02:39:43,923
It enormously helpful to me in my life I'm sure.

3950
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:46,750
My sister also went to Harvard

3951
02:39:47,820 --> 02:39:52,530
and the experiences, learnings,

3952
02:39:52,530 --> 02:39:55,541
friendships, relationships.

3953
02:39:55,541 --> 02:39:58,800
Again, I'm very happy with my life.

3954
02:39:58,800 --> 02:40:00,240
Harvard was an important part of my life.

3955
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:02,250
I went there for both undergrad and business school.

3956
02:40:02,250 --> 02:40:05,104
I learned a ton, met a lot of faculty,

3957
02:40:05,104 --> 02:40:06,600
a lot from number of my closest friends

3958
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:10,560
who I still really keep in touch with, I met them.

3959
02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:12,123
So yeah, it's a great place,

3960
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:15,690
but it needs a reboot.

3961
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:17,700
- Yeah, I still have hope.

3962
02:40:17,700 --> 02:40:21,167
I think universities are really important institutions.

3963
02:40:21,167 --> 02:40:22,000
- You know, when I went to Harvard

3964
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:23,460
there were 1600 people in my class.

3965
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:26,460
I think today's class is about the same size

3966
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:30,543
and their online education really has not sort of taken off.

3967
02:40:31,710 --> 02:40:34,200
So I heard Peter Thiel speak at one point in time

3968
02:40:34,200 --> 02:40:38,430
and he is like, what great institution do you know

3969
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:43,353
that's truly great that hasn't grown in a hundred years.

3970
02:40:44,670 --> 02:40:46,980
And you know, the incentives in some sense

3971
02:40:46,980 --> 02:40:49,080
of the alums are for it.

3972
02:40:49,080 --> 02:40:50,940
It's a bit like a club.

3973
02:40:50,940 --> 02:40:53,130
If you're proud of the elitism of the club,

3974
02:40:53,130 --> 02:40:54,870
you don't want many new members.

3975
02:40:54,870 --> 02:40:57,000
But the fact that the population has grown

3976
02:40:57,000 --> 02:41:00,600
of the country significantly

3977
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:03,930
since certainly I was a student in 1984.

3978
02:41:03,930 --> 02:41:05,970
And the fact that Harvard recruits people

3979
02:41:05,970 --> 02:41:07,500
from all over the world,

3980
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:09,750
it's really serving a smaller and smaller percentage

3981
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:11,520
of the population today.

3982
02:41:11,520 --> 02:41:13,170
And some were most talented

3983
02:41:13,170 --> 02:41:16,890
and successful entrepreneurs anyway.

3984
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:19,950
You know it's a token of success

3985
02:41:19,950 --> 02:41:22,650
that they didn't make it through their undergraduate years.

3986
02:41:22,650 --> 02:41:24,030
You know, they left as a freshman

3987
02:41:24,030 --> 02:41:25,500
or they didn't attend at all.

3988
02:41:25,500 --> 02:41:26,820
- For entrepreneurs, yes.

3989
02:41:26,820 --> 02:41:28,230
But it's still a place--

3990
02:41:28,230 --> 02:41:30,540
- Very important for research,

3991
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:32,500
very important for advancing ideas

3992
02:41:33,750 --> 02:41:36,420
and shaping dialogue

3993
02:41:36,420 --> 02:41:40,353
and the next generation of Supreme Court justices.

3994
02:41:41,490 --> 02:41:45,180
The members of government politicians.

3995
02:41:45,180 --> 02:41:46,740
So yes, it's critically important,

3996
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:51,740
but it's not doing the job it should be doing.

3997
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:55,890
- Neri Oxman, somebody you mentioned several times

3998
02:41:55,890 --> 02:41:56,760
throughout this podcast,

3999
02:41:56,760 --> 02:42:00,240
somebody I had a wonderful conversation with,

4000
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:03,330
a friendship with I've known, looked up to her,

4001
02:42:03,330 --> 02:42:06,780
admired her, I've been a fan of hers for a long time

4002
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:09,633
for work and of her as a human being.

4003
02:42:10,680 --> 02:42:12,600
Looks like you're a fan of hers as well.

4004
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:13,433
- Yes.

4005
02:42:14,280 --> 02:42:16,440
- What do you love about Neri?

4006
02:42:16,440 --> 02:42:17,400
What do you admire about her

4007
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:19,560
as a scientist, artist, human being?

4008
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:23,970
- I think she's the most beautiful person I've ever met.

4009
02:42:23,970 --> 02:42:26,673
And I mean that from like the center of her soul.

4010
02:42:28,170 --> 02:42:31,983
She's the most caring, warm, considerate,

4011
02:42:32,910 --> 02:42:36,363
thoughtful person I've ever met.

4012
02:42:37,314 --> 02:42:42,060
And she couples those remarkable qualities

4013
02:42:42,060 --> 02:42:45,480
with brilliance, incredible creativity,

4014
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:48,783
beauty, elegance, grace.

4015
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:51,880
Yeah, I'm talking about my wife,

4016
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:55,293
but I'm talking incredibly dispassionately.

4017
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:58,650
But I mean, what I say,

4018
02:42:58,650 --> 02:43:01,350
she's the most remarkable person I've ever met.

4019
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:03,630
And I've met a lot of remarkable people

4020
02:43:03,630 --> 02:43:06,270
and I'm incredibly fortunate to spend

4021
02:43:06,270 --> 02:43:09,090
a very high percentage of my life time

4022
02:43:09,090 --> 02:43:14,010
with her ever since I met her six years ago.

4023
02:43:14,010 --> 02:43:15,630
- So she's been a help to you

4024
02:43:15,630 --> 02:43:17,760
through some of the rough moments you described.

4025
02:43:17,760 --> 02:43:19,960
- For sure. I mean, I met her at the bottom,

4026
02:43:20,820 --> 02:43:23,670
which is not a bad place to meet someone if it works out.

4027
02:43:25,020 --> 02:43:27,810
- Is there some degree of ying and yang

4028
02:43:27,810 --> 02:43:29,400
with the two personalities you have,

4029
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:33,150
you have described yourself as emotional and so on,

4030
02:43:33,150 --> 02:43:35,940
but it does seem the two of you

4031
02:43:35,940 --> 02:43:37,470
have slightly different styles

4032
02:43:37,470 --> 02:43:39,090
about how you approach the world.

4033
02:43:39,090 --> 02:43:41,340
- Well, interestingly, we have a lot of like,

4034
02:43:43,230 --> 02:43:45,790
we come from very similar places in the world.

4035
02:43:45,790 --> 02:43:47,100
You know, there are times where we feel like

4036
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:49,020
we've known each other for centuries.

4037
02:43:49,020 --> 02:43:51,320
You know, I met her parents for the first time

4038
02:43:52,775 --> 02:43:55,860
a long time ago, almost six years ago as well.

4039
02:43:55,860 --> 02:43:59,820
And I knew her parents were from Eastern Europe originally.

4040
02:43:59,820 --> 02:44:01,860
So I asked her father like, what, you know,

4041
02:44:01,860 --> 02:44:05,280
what city did her family come from originally?

4042
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:07,590
And I called my father

4043
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:11,430
and asked him, dad, what's grandpa Abraham?

4044
02:44:11,430 --> 02:44:13,500
What's the name of the city?

4045
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:16,980
And then I put the two cities into Google Maps

4046
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:18,430
and they were 52 miles apart,

4047
02:44:19,322 --> 02:44:20,813
which I thought was pretty cool.

4048
02:44:21,660 --> 02:44:23,970
Then of course, at some point we did genetic testing

4049
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:26,400
to make sure we weren't related.

4050
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:27,720
Which we were not.

4051
02:44:27,720 --> 02:44:31,413
But we share incredible commonality on values.

4052
02:44:32,280 --> 02:44:34,533
We are attracted to the same kind of people,

4053
02:44:35,370 --> 02:44:37,830
she loves my friends, I love hers.

4054
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:40,410
We love doing the same kind of things,

4055
02:44:40,410 --> 02:44:44,696
we're attracted to like spending time the same ways.

4056
02:44:44,696 --> 02:44:49,696
And she has, yes, more emotion, more elegance.

4057
02:44:52,590 --> 02:44:54,390
She doesn't like battles,

4058
02:44:54,390 --> 02:44:55,490
but she's very strong.

4059
02:44:57,180 --> 02:44:58,800
But she's more sensitive than I am.

4060
02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:02,430
- Yeah, you are constantly in multiple battles

4061
02:45:02,430 --> 02:45:03,510
at the same time.

4062
02:45:03,510 --> 02:45:08,510
And there's often the media, social media

4063
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,250
is just fire everywhere.

4064
02:45:11,250 --> 02:45:14,520
- You know, that hasn't really been the case for a while.

4065
02:45:14,520 --> 02:45:16,540
I've had relative peace for a long time

4066
02:45:18,120 --> 02:45:20,370
as I haven't had to be the kind of activist I was

4067
02:45:20,370 --> 02:45:21,423
earlier in my career,

4068
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:24,000
I think since October 7th, yes,

4069
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:25,770
I do feel like I've been in a war.

4070
02:45:25,770 --> 02:45:30,770
- Can you tell me the saga of the accusations against Neri?

4071
02:45:32,220 --> 02:45:36,330
- So I did not actually surface the plagiarism allegations

4072
02:45:36,330 --> 02:45:39,510
against President Gay that surfaced by Aaron

4073
02:45:39,510 --> 02:45:42,120
and maybe Christopher Rufo as well,

4074
02:45:42,120 --> 02:45:44,220
or maybe Chris helped promote

4075
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:48,770
what Aaron and some anonymous person identified.

4076
02:45:50,310 --> 02:45:51,247
But I certainly, it was a point in time

4077
02:45:51,247 --> 02:45:54,510
where the board had said we're a hundred percent behind her

4078
02:45:54,510 --> 02:45:58,050
and unanimously, and I really felt she had to go.

4079
02:45:58,050 --> 02:45:59,670
So it didn't bother me at all

4080
02:45:59,670 --> 02:46:02,370
that they had identified problems with her work.

4081
02:46:02,370 --> 02:46:06,030
So I shared, I reposted those posts

4082
02:46:06,030 --> 02:46:06,990
and then when the board...

4083
02:46:06,990 --> 02:46:10,380
She ultimately resigned and she got a $900,000 a year

4084
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:12,390
professorship continuing at Harvard.

4085
02:46:12,390 --> 02:46:15,870
I said, look, in light of her limited academic record

4086
02:46:15,870 --> 02:46:19,533
and these plagiarism allegations she had to go.

4087
02:46:21,690 --> 02:46:24,570
I knew when I did so I assumed,

4088
02:46:24,570 --> 02:46:26,100
I was actually a bit paranoid

4089
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:28,320
about that thesis I had written.

4090
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:29,793
I only had one academic work,

4091
02:46:31,230 --> 02:46:32,760
but I hadn't checked it for plagiarism.

4092
02:46:32,760 --> 02:46:35,703
And I thought, that's gonna happen.

4093
02:46:38,100 --> 02:46:39,720
I did not have a copy on hand.

4094
02:46:39,720 --> 02:46:41,370
So I got a copy of my thesis

4095
02:46:41,370 --> 02:46:44,070
and I remember writing it.

4096
02:46:44,070 --> 02:46:46,140
Harvard at the time was pretty,

4097
02:46:46,140 --> 02:46:47,700
they kind of gave you a lecture about

4098
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:50,640
making sure you have all your footnotes and quotation marks.

4099
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:52,830
I learned later that apparently

4100
02:46:52,830 --> 02:46:55,920
they had a copy of my thesis at the New York Public Library.

4101
02:46:55,920 --> 02:47:00,920
And a member of the media told me he was there online

4102
02:47:00,930 --> 02:47:03,870
with a dozen other members of the media

4103
02:47:03,870 --> 02:47:06,450
all trying to get a copy of my thesis

4104
02:47:06,450 --> 02:47:08,370
to run it through some AI.

4105
02:47:08,370 --> 02:47:10,260
They had to first do optical character recognition

4106
02:47:10,260 --> 02:47:13,683
to convert the paper document into digital.

4107
02:47:14,700 --> 02:47:17,790
But fortunately, through a miracle

4108
02:47:17,790 --> 02:47:19,740
I didn't have an issue.

4109
02:47:19,740 --> 02:47:21,540
I didn't think about Neri of course,

4110
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:25,710
who has whatever, 130 academic works.

4111
02:47:25,710 --> 02:47:28,740
And so we were just at the end of a vacation

4112
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:30,720
for Christmas break

4113
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:34,920
and I was early in the morning for a vacation time

4114
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:37,560
and all of a sudden I hear my phone ringing

4115
02:47:37,560 --> 02:47:38,490
in the other room

4116
02:47:38,490 --> 02:47:40,290
or vibrating in the other room multiple times.

4117
02:47:40,290 --> 02:47:41,490
I'm like, hmm.

4118
02:47:41,490 --> 02:47:42,690
I pick up the phone.

4119
02:47:42,690 --> 02:47:45,510
It's our communication guy, Fran McGill.

4120
02:47:45,510 --> 02:47:48,000
And he's like, Bill Business Insider

4121
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,890
has apparently identified a number of instances

4122
02:47:49,890 --> 02:47:52,350
of plagiarism in Neri's dissertation.

4123
02:47:52,350 --> 02:47:53,280
Let me send you this email.

4124
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:55,020
He sent me the email

4125
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:58,920
and they had identified four paragraphs

4126
02:47:58,920 --> 02:48:01,320
in her 330 page dissertation

4127
02:48:01,320 --> 02:48:03,270
where she had cited the author,

4128
02:48:03,270 --> 02:48:05,940
but she had used the vast majority of the words,

4129
02:48:05,940 --> 02:48:08,340
and that those paragraphs were from the author

4130
02:48:08,340 --> 02:48:10,560
and she should have used quotation mark.

4131
02:48:10,560 --> 02:48:11,490
And then there was one case

4132
02:48:11,490 --> 02:48:15,780
where she paraphrased correctly an author,

4133
02:48:15,780 --> 02:48:20,073
but did not footnote that it was from his work.

4134
02:48:21,538 --> 02:48:23,340
And so we were presented with this

4135
02:48:23,340 --> 02:48:25,080
and told they're gonna publish in a few hours.

4136
02:48:25,080 --> 02:48:26,550
And we're like, well, can we get to the next day?

4137
02:48:26,550 --> 02:48:28,230
We're just about to head home.

4138
02:48:28,230 --> 02:48:30,660
And they're like, no, we're publishing by noon.

4139
02:48:30,660 --> 02:48:32,310
We need an answer by noon.

4140
02:48:32,310 --> 02:48:35,910
And so we downloaded the copy of her thesis

4141
02:48:35,910 --> 02:48:37,210
on like the slow internet.

4142
02:48:38,070 --> 02:48:39,990
And you know, Neri checked it out

4143
02:48:39,990 --> 02:48:40,920
and she said, you know what?

4144
02:48:40,920 --> 02:48:42,660
Looks like they're right.

4145
02:48:42,660 --> 02:48:45,210
And I said, look, you should just admit your mistake.

4146
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:48,660
And she wrote a very simple, gracious,

4147
02:48:48,660 --> 02:48:51,930
yes, I should have used quotation marks.

4148
02:48:51,930 --> 02:48:54,900
And on the author I failed to cite,

4149
02:48:54,900 --> 02:48:56,820
she pointed out that she cited them many other times

4150
02:48:56,820 --> 02:48:59,190
and wrote her several paragraph section

4151
02:48:59,190 --> 02:49:01,803
of her thesis acknowledging his work.

4152
02:49:02,850 --> 02:49:05,160
And none of these were like important parts of her thesis.

4153
02:49:05,160 --> 02:49:06,210
But she acknowledged her mistake

4154
02:49:06,210 --> 02:49:08,400
and she said, you know, apologize for my mistake.

4155
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:11,850
And I apologize to the author who I failed to cite

4156
02:49:11,850 --> 02:49:13,400
and I stand on the shoulders of

4157
02:49:14,310 --> 02:49:15,657
all the people came before me

4158
02:49:15,657 --> 02:49:17,700
and looking to advance work.

4159
02:49:17,700 --> 02:49:19,620
We sort of thought it was over,

4160
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:20,453
we head home.

4161
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:24,600
In flight on the way home, although we didn't realize this

4162
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:27,030
till we got back the following day,

4163
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:29,310
Business Insider published another article

4164
02:49:29,310 --> 02:49:32,013
and said, Neri Oxman admits to plagiarism.

4165
02:49:32,940 --> 02:49:35,460
Plagiarism of course is academic fraud.

4166
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:37,320
And this thing goes crazy viral.

4167
02:49:37,320 --> 02:49:40,293
Oh, the title is Bill Ackman's wife,

4168
02:49:41,130 --> 02:49:44,070
celebrity Academic Neri Oxman.

4169
02:49:44,070 --> 02:49:45,450
And they use the term celebrity

4170
02:49:45,450 --> 02:49:48,720
because there are limits

4171
02:49:48,720 --> 02:49:51,780
to what legitimate media can go after.

4172
02:49:51,780 --> 02:49:54,390
But you know, celebrities,

4173
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:55,920
there's a lot more leeway in the media

4174
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:56,760
and what they can say.

4175
02:49:56,760 --> 02:49:58,470
So that's why they call her a celebrity.

4176
02:49:58,470 --> 02:50:00,720
First time ever she'd been called a celebrity

4177
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:06,590
and they basically, she's admitting to academic fraud.

4178
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:12,480
And then the next day at 5:19 PM

4179
02:50:12,480 --> 02:50:14,280
I remember the timeline pretty well.

4180
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:17,553
An email was sent to Fran McGill saying,

4181
02:50:19,800 --> 02:50:23,190
we've identified two dozen other instances

4182
02:50:23,190 --> 02:50:25,620
of plagiarism in her work.

4183
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:27,450
15 of which are Wikipedia entries

4184
02:50:27,450 --> 02:50:29,430
where she copied definitions

4185
02:50:29,430 --> 02:50:33,990
and the others were mostly software hardware manuals

4186
02:50:33,990 --> 02:50:37,110
for various devices or software she used in her work,

4187
02:50:37,110 --> 02:50:38,250
most of which were in footnotes

4188
02:50:38,250 --> 02:50:40,890
where she described a nozzle for a 3D printer

4189
02:50:40,890 --> 02:50:42,040
or something like this.

4190
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:45,693
And they said, we're publishing tonight.

4191
02:50:47,190 --> 02:50:50,460
The email they sent to us was 6,900 words.

4192
02:50:50,460 --> 02:50:53,220
It was 12 pages, it was practically indecipherable.

4193
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:55,860
You couldn't even read it in an hour.

4194
02:50:55,860 --> 02:50:57,210
And we didn't have some of the documents

4195
02:50:57,210 --> 02:50:59,040
that were referring to.

4196
02:50:59,040 --> 02:50:59,940
And I'm like, now you know what?

4197
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:01,140
I'm gonna do it.

4198
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:03,603
I think it'll be useful to provide context here.

4199
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:06,113
I'm gonna do a review

4200
02:51:06,113 --> 02:51:08,850
of every MIT professor's dissertations,

4201
02:51:08,850 --> 02:51:11,313
every published paper AI has enabled this.

4202
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:15,360
I put out a tweet basically saying that,

4203
02:51:15,360 --> 02:51:17,280
and we're doing a test run now

4204
02:51:17,280 --> 02:51:18,113
because we have to get it right

4205
02:51:18,113 --> 02:51:20,100
and I think it'll be a useful exercise,

4206
02:51:20,100 --> 02:51:21,843
provide some context if you will.

4207
02:51:22,890 --> 02:51:25,233
And then this thing goes crazy viral.

4208
02:51:26,430 --> 02:51:30,630
And you know, Neri is a pretty sensitive person,

4209
02:51:30,630 --> 02:51:32,490
pretty emotional person,

4210
02:51:32,490 --> 02:51:35,070
and someone who's a perfectionist

4211
02:51:35,070 --> 02:51:36,810
and having everyone in the world thinking

4212
02:51:36,810 --> 02:51:40,230
you committed academic fraud is a pretty damning thing.

4213
02:51:40,230 --> 02:51:41,790
Now, they did say, they did a thorough review

4214
02:51:41,790 --> 02:51:43,950
of all of her work and this is what they found.

4215
02:51:43,950 --> 02:51:46,320
I'm like, sweetheart, that's remarkable.

4216
02:51:46,320 --> 02:51:49,470
I did 130 works, 73 of which were peer reviewed,

4217
02:51:49,470 --> 02:51:50,303
blah blah blah.

4218
02:51:50,303 --> 02:51:51,390
And she's published in Nature Science

4219
02:51:51,390 --> 02:51:53,070
and all these different publications.

4220
02:51:53,070 --> 02:51:56,160
That's actually, that's a pretty good batting average.

4221
02:51:56,160 --> 02:52:00,120
But you know, they can't, this is wrong, right?

4222
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:01,980
This is not academic fraud.

4223
02:52:01,980 --> 02:52:03,270
These are inadvertent mistakes.

4224
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:04,500
And the Wikipedia entries,

4225
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:06,450
Neri actually used Wikipedia as a dictionary.

4226
02:52:06,450 --> 02:52:08,400
This is the early days of Wikipedia.

4227
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:11,310
And they also referred to the MIT handbook,

4228
02:52:11,310 --> 02:52:14,850
which has a whole section on plagiarism academic handbook.

4229
02:52:14,850 --> 02:52:17,910
And if you read it, which I ultimately did,

4230
02:52:17,910 --> 02:52:20,250
they make clear a few things.

4231
02:52:20,250 --> 02:52:23,580
Number one, there's plagiarism, academic fraud,

4232
02:52:23,580 --> 02:52:26,190
and there's what they call inadvertent plagiarism,

4233
02:52:26,190 --> 02:52:28,770
which is clerical errors where you make a mistake

4234
02:52:28,770 --> 02:52:30,510
and it depends on intent.

4235
02:52:30,510 --> 02:52:33,510
And there's a link that you can go to,

4236
02:52:33,510 --> 02:52:36,330
which is a section on, if you get investigated, MIT,

4237
02:52:36,330 --> 02:52:37,800
what happens, what's the procedure,

4238
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:38,790
what's the initial stage,

4239
02:52:38,790 --> 02:52:40,110
what's the investigative stage,

4240
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:42,110
what's the procedure if they identify it

4241
02:52:42,960 --> 02:52:46,437
and they make very clear that academic fraud is,

4242
02:52:46,437 --> 02:52:49,980
and they list plagiarism, research theft,

4243
02:52:49,980 --> 02:52:54,180
a few other things, but it does not include honest errors.

4244
02:52:54,180 --> 02:52:57,753
Honest errors are not plagiarism under MIT's own policies.

4245
02:52:58,825 --> 02:53:00,690
And in the handbook they also have a big section

4246
02:53:00,690 --> 02:53:03,120
on what they call common knowledge.

4247
02:53:03,120 --> 02:53:04,680
And common knowledge depends on

4248
02:53:04,680 --> 02:53:06,430
who you're writing your thesis for.

4249
02:53:07,650 --> 02:53:12,150
And so if it's a fact that is known by your audience,

4250
02:53:12,150 --> 02:53:14,490
you're not required to quote or cite.

4251
02:53:14,490 --> 02:53:16,170
And so all those Wikipedia entries

4252
02:53:16,170 --> 02:53:17,910
were for things like sustainable design,

4253
02:53:17,910 --> 02:53:18,990
computer aided design.

4254
02:53:18,990 --> 02:53:21,303
She just took a definition from Wikipedia,

4255
02:53:22,470 --> 02:53:24,540
common knowledge to her readers,

4256
02:53:24,540 --> 02:53:26,370
no obligation under the handbook,

4257
02:53:26,370 --> 02:53:29,070
totally exempt on the,

4258
02:53:29,070 --> 02:53:31,590
using the same words she referred to

4259
02:53:31,590 --> 02:53:33,870
like an whatever, some kind of 3D printer.

4260
02:53:33,870 --> 02:53:36,120
She was the Stratasys 3D printer

4261
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:38,400
and she quoted from the manual right away.

4262
02:53:38,400 --> 02:53:40,590
Stratasys is a company you consulted for.

4263
02:53:40,590 --> 02:53:41,910
You don't need to...

4264
02:53:41,910 --> 02:53:43,620
That's not something, you're not stealing your ideas,

4265
02:53:43,620 --> 02:53:46,230
you're describing a nozzle for a device

4266
02:53:46,230 --> 02:53:48,060
you use in your work in a footnote.

4267
02:53:48,060 --> 02:53:50,763
That's not a theft of idea, right?

4268
02:53:52,200 --> 02:53:54,210
And so I'm like, this is crazy.

4269
02:53:54,210 --> 02:53:56,790
And so this has gotta stop.

4270
02:53:56,790 --> 02:54:00,927
And so I reach out to a guy I knew

4271
02:54:00,927 --> 02:54:03,450
who was on the board of Business Insider, the chairman,

4272
02:54:03,450 --> 02:54:05,910
and his name is gonna come public shortly.

4273
02:54:05,910 --> 02:54:09,540
I committed to that time to keep his name confidential.

4274
02:54:09,540 --> 02:54:11,670
It's now surfaced publicly in the press.

4275
02:54:11,670 --> 02:54:13,500
- Can I just pause real quick here?

4276
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:14,333
- Sure.

4277
02:54:15,420 --> 02:54:17,970
- I don't know, there's a lot of things I wanna say,

4278
02:54:17,970 --> 02:54:20,490
but you made it pretty clear.

4279
02:54:20,490 --> 02:54:23,103
But just as a member of the community,

4280
02:54:24,900 --> 02:54:27,090
there's also like a common sense test.

4281
02:54:27,090 --> 02:54:29,670
I think you're more precisely

4282
02:54:29,670 --> 02:54:31,740
like legal and looking at,

4283
02:54:31,740 --> 02:54:34,080
but there's just like a bullshit test.

4284
02:54:34,080 --> 02:54:38,550
And like nothing that Neri did is plagiarism

4285
02:54:38,550 --> 02:54:41,280
in the bad meaning of the word.

4286
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:44,700
Plagiarism right now is becoming another ism, like racism

4287
02:54:44,700 --> 02:54:47,130
or so on using as an attack word.

4288
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:48,810
I don't care what the meaning of it is,

4289
02:54:48,810 --> 02:54:52,320
but there's the bad academic fraud like theft.

4290
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:54,000
Theft of an idea.

4291
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,760
And maybe you can say a lot of definitions

4292
02:54:56,760 --> 02:54:57,593
and this kind of stuff.

4293
02:54:57,593 --> 02:54:59,910
But then there's just a basic bullshit test

4294
02:54:59,910 --> 02:55:02,760
where everyone knows this is a thief

4295
02:55:02,760 --> 02:55:05,280
and this is definitely not a thief.

4296
02:55:05,280 --> 02:55:08,610
And there's nothing about anything that Neri did

4297
02:55:08,610 --> 02:55:12,480
anything in her thesis or in her life.

4298
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:16,380
Everyone that knows her, she's a rock star, right?

4299
02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:18,120
I just wanna make it clear,

4300
02:55:18,120 --> 02:55:20,430
it really hurt me that the internet,

4301
02:55:20,430 --> 02:55:24,303
whatever's happening, could go after a great scientist.

4302
02:55:28,110 --> 02:55:30,930
'Cause I love science and I love celebrating

4303
02:55:30,930 --> 02:55:35,610
great scientists and it's just really messed up

4304
02:55:35,610 --> 02:55:37,440
that whatever the machine,

4305
02:55:37,440 --> 02:55:40,680
we could talk about Business Inside or whatever,

4306
02:55:40,680 --> 02:55:45,480
social media, mass hysteria, whatever is happening.

4307
02:55:45,480 --> 02:55:48,630
Like we need the great scientists of the world.

4308
02:55:48,630 --> 02:55:50,427
'Cause that's like the future depends on them.

4309
02:55:50,427 --> 02:55:52,890
And so we need to celebrate them and protect them

4310
02:55:52,890 --> 02:55:56,340
and let them flourish and let their do their thing

4311
02:55:56,340 --> 02:56:00,300
and like keep them out of this whatever shit storm

4312
02:56:00,300 --> 02:56:03,720
that we're doing to get clicks and advertisements and drama

4313
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:05,690
and all this kind, we need to protect them.

4314
02:56:05,690 --> 02:56:07,431
So I just wanna say

4315
02:56:07,431 --> 02:56:08,670
there's nobody I know

4316
02:56:08,670 --> 02:56:13,440
and I'm a million friends that are scientists,

4317
02:56:13,440 --> 02:56:15,510
world class scientists, Nobel Prize winners,

4318
02:56:15,510 --> 02:56:18,360
they all love Neri, they all respect Neri

4319
02:56:18,360 --> 02:56:20,163
she did zero wrong.

4320
02:56:21,754 --> 02:56:23,310
And then the rest of the conversation we can have about

4321
02:56:23,310 --> 02:56:25,200
how broken journalism is and so on.

4322
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:28,260
But like, I just wanna say that there's nothing

4323
02:56:28,260 --> 02:56:29,550
that Neri did wrong.

4324
02:56:29,550 --> 02:56:31,830
It's not a gray area or so on.

4325
02:56:31,830 --> 02:56:35,970
I also personally don't love that Claudine Gay

4326
02:56:35,970 --> 02:56:37,950
is a discussion about plagiarism

4327
02:56:37,950 --> 02:56:42,213
'cause it distracts from the fundamentals that is broken.

4328
02:56:43,380 --> 02:56:46,890
It's becomes like some weird technical discussion.

4329
02:56:46,890 --> 02:56:49,920
But in case of Neri did nothing wrong,

4330
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:52,860
great scientist, great engineer at MIT

4331
02:56:52,860 --> 02:56:55,950
and beyond, she's doing a cool thing now so anyway.

4332
02:56:55,950 --> 02:56:57,150
- Could not have said it better myself.

4333
02:56:57,150 --> 02:56:59,610
Now obviously I'm focused on the technical part, right?

4334
02:56:59,610 --> 02:57:02,550
- [Lex] Because you wanna be precise.

4335
02:57:02,550 --> 02:57:03,383
- Well, it's not even that.

4336
02:57:03,383 --> 02:57:05,610
I mean, yes, I have said

4337
02:57:05,610 --> 02:57:06,930
that we're gonna sue Business Insider

4338
02:57:06,930 --> 02:57:10,410
and in 35 years of my career

4339
02:57:10,410 --> 02:57:12,120
of someone who has not every article

4340
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:13,830
has been a favorable one.

4341
02:57:13,830 --> 02:57:16,110
Not every article has been an accurate one.

4342
02:57:16,110 --> 02:57:18,750
I've never threatened to sue the media

4343
02:57:18,750 --> 02:57:21,810
and I've never sued the media.

4344
02:57:21,810 --> 02:57:23,730
But this is so egregious.

4345
02:57:23,730 --> 02:57:26,130
It's not just that she did nothing wrong,

4346
02:57:26,130 --> 02:57:29,130
but they accused her of academic fraud.

4347
02:57:29,130 --> 02:57:32,460
They did it knowing they make reference

4348
02:57:32,460 --> 02:57:33,450
to MIT's own handbook.

4349
02:57:33,450 --> 02:57:35,370
So they had to read all the same stuff

4350
02:57:35,370 --> 02:57:37,200
that I read in the handbook.

4351
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:38,313
They did that work.

4352
02:57:39,180 --> 02:57:42,850
Then after escalated this thing to

4353
02:57:43,770 --> 02:57:46,410
Henry Blot, the Chairman of Business Insider,

4354
02:57:46,410 --> 02:57:49,170
to the CEO of Axle Springer,

4355
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:50,700
I even reached out to Henry Kravis

4356
02:57:50,700 --> 02:57:51,570
at a certain point in time.

4357
02:57:51,570 --> 02:57:52,770
One of the controlling shareholders

4358
02:57:52,770 --> 02:57:54,243
of the company through KKR.

4359
02:57:56,370 --> 02:57:59,940
Laying out the factual errors in the article,

4360
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:02,100
Business Center went public

4361
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:05,550
after they said Neri committed academic fraud and plagiarism

4362
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:07,710
and said, we didn't challenge any,

4363
02:58:07,710 --> 02:58:12,025
the facts remain undisputed in the article.

4364
02:58:12,025 --> 02:58:16,710
So it's basically Neri committed plagiarism that story won,

4365
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:18,210
Neri admits to plagiarism.

4366
02:58:18,210 --> 02:58:19,560
She admits to plagiarism.

4367
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:22,380
She admitted to making a few clerical errors.

4368
02:58:22,380 --> 02:58:24,180
That's the only thing she admitted to.

4369
02:58:24,180 --> 02:58:25,530
And she graciously apologized.

4370
02:58:25,530 --> 02:58:27,630
So they said, Neri admits to plagiarism,

4371
02:58:27,630 --> 02:58:28,950
apologizes for plagiarism.

4372
02:58:28,950 --> 02:58:30,300
That's incredibly damning.

4373
02:58:30,300 --> 02:58:32,550
And by the way, we're doing an investigation

4374
02:58:32,550 --> 02:58:34,170
'cause we're concerned that there might have been

4375
02:58:34,170 --> 02:58:36,780
inappropriate process,

4376
02:58:36,780 --> 02:58:38,700
but the facts of the story

4377
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:41,310
have not been disputed by Neri Oxman or Bill Ackman.

4378
02:58:41,310 --> 02:58:43,680
And that was totally false.

4379
02:58:43,680 --> 02:58:44,940
I had done it privately,

4380
02:58:44,940 --> 02:58:48,300
I'd done it publicly on Twitter on X,

4381
02:58:48,300 --> 02:58:51,090
I laid out, I have a whole tech stream,

4382
02:58:51,090 --> 02:58:53,250
a WhatsApp stream with the CEO of the company.

4383
02:58:53,250 --> 02:58:56,010
And they doubled down and they doubled down again.

4384
02:58:56,010 --> 02:58:58,143
And so I don't sue people lightly.

4385
02:58:59,490 --> 02:59:02,910
And you stay tuned.

4386
02:59:02,910 --> 02:59:07,523
- So you are, at least for now, moving forward with--

4387
02:59:08,562 --> 02:59:11,100
- It's a certainty we're moving forward.

4388
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:13,750
There's this step we can take prior to suing them

4389
02:59:14,700 --> 02:59:18,330
where we basically send them a letter

4390
02:59:18,330 --> 02:59:20,560
demanding they make a series of corrections

4391
02:59:21,480 --> 02:59:24,450
that if they don't make those corrections,

4392
02:59:24,450 --> 02:59:26,670
the next step is litigation.

4393
02:59:26,670 --> 02:59:28,740
I hope we can avoid the next step.

4394
02:59:28,740 --> 02:59:30,303
And I'm just making sure that

4395
02:59:30,303 --> 02:59:33,480
when we present the demand to Business Insider

4396
02:59:33,480 --> 02:59:35,850
and ultimately to Axel Springer,

4397
02:59:35,850 --> 02:59:38,100
that it's incredibly clear

4398
02:59:38,100 --> 02:59:40,680
how they defamed her,

4399
02:59:40,680 --> 02:59:42,460
the factual mistakes in her stories

4400
02:59:43,530 --> 02:59:45,210
and what they need to do to fix it.

4401
02:59:45,210 --> 02:59:46,410
And if we can fix it there,

4402
02:59:46,410 --> 02:59:48,210
we can move on from this episode

4403
02:59:48,210 --> 02:59:50,580
and hopefully avoid litigation,

4404
02:59:50,580 --> 02:59:51,480
so that's where we're.

4405
02:59:51,480 --> 02:59:52,890
- I don't know, you're smarter than me.

4406
02:59:52,890 --> 02:59:54,840
There's technical stuff, there's legal stuff,

4407
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:56,130
there's journalistic stuff.

4408
02:59:56,130 --> 03:00:00,153
But just fuck you Business Insider for doing this.

4409
03:00:02,146 --> 03:00:03,540
I don't know much in this world,

4410
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:06,420
but journalists aren't supposed to do that.

4411
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:10,360
- Now we're gonna surface all this stuff publicly ultimately

4412
03:00:11,340 --> 03:00:13,530
the email was not to Neri

4413
03:00:13,530 --> 03:00:15,270
saying there was plagiarism in her work.

4414
03:00:15,270 --> 03:00:17,607
The email came from a reporter named Katherine Long,

4415
03:00:17,607 --> 03:00:21,270
and the headline was, your wife committed plagiarism,

4416
03:00:21,270 --> 03:00:24,540
shouldn't she be fired from MIT

4417
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:28,043
just like you caused Claudine Gay to be fired from Harvard.

4418
03:00:28,043 --> 03:00:30,900
It was a political agenda.

4419
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:33,000
She doesn't like me, okay.

4420
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,010
And she was trying to hurt me

4421
03:00:35,010 --> 03:00:37,360
and they couldn't find plagiarism in my thesis.

4422
03:00:40,560 --> 03:00:42,120
And being a short seller,

4423
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:44,070
the Herbalife battle went on for years,

4424
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,610
they tried to do everything to destroy my reputation.

4425
03:00:47,610 --> 03:00:49,080
So they're already gone through my trash.

4426
03:00:49,080 --> 03:00:50,880
They already done all that work.

4427
03:00:50,880 --> 03:00:54,720
So anything they could possibly find,

4428
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:58,770
and I've always lived a very clean life, okay?

4429
03:00:58,770 --> 03:01:00,720
Thankfully. And if you're gonna be an activist,

4430
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:01,650
short sell, you better

4431
03:01:01,650 --> 03:01:05,100
'cause they're gonna find out dirt on if it exists.

4432
03:01:05,100 --> 03:01:07,740
And so they were like, how can we really hurt Bill?

4433
03:01:07,740 --> 03:01:10,380
And by the way Neri had left MIT years earlier.

4434
03:01:10,380 --> 03:01:11,490
When the reporter found out

4435
03:01:11,490 --> 03:01:13,680
she was no longer a member of the MIT faculty,

4436
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:14,700
they were enraged.

4437
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:16,020
They didn't believe us.

4438
03:01:16,020 --> 03:01:17,830
They made us like prove to us

4439
03:01:17,830 --> 03:01:19,110
she's no longer on the MIT faculty

4440
03:01:19,110 --> 03:01:20,790
'cause they wanted to get her fired.

4441
03:01:20,790 --> 03:01:23,920
And by the way, malice is one of the

4442
03:01:25,080 --> 03:01:26,754
important factors in determining

4443
03:01:26,754 --> 03:01:28,470
whether defamation is taking place.

4444
03:01:28,470 --> 03:01:31,560
And this was a malice driven,

4445
03:01:31,560 --> 03:01:33,450
this was not about news.

4446
03:01:33,450 --> 03:01:36,270
And the unfortunate thing about journalism,

4447
03:01:36,270 --> 03:01:38,550
this businesses made a fortune from this.

4448
03:01:38,550 --> 03:01:41,730
This story was published and republished

4449
03:01:41,730 --> 03:01:44,640
by thousands of media organizations around the world.

4450
03:01:44,640 --> 03:01:46,530
It was the number one trending thing on Twitter

4451
03:01:46,530 --> 03:01:47,943
for like two days.

4452
03:01:49,530 --> 03:01:51,750
Every newspaper, it was on the front page

4453
03:01:51,750 --> 03:01:53,313
of every Israeli newspaper.

4454
03:01:54,570 --> 03:01:56,610
It was on the front page of the Financial Times.

4455
03:01:56,610 --> 03:01:59,880
Okay, so this, and she's building a business

4456
03:01:59,880 --> 03:02:03,930
and you know if you're CEO of a science company

4457
03:02:03,930 --> 03:02:05,370
and you committed academic fraud,

4458
03:02:05,370 --> 03:02:07,380
that's incredibly damaging.

4459
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:10,950
But I ultimately convinced her that this was good.

4460
03:02:10,950 --> 03:02:13,800
I said, sweetheart, you're amazing.

4461
03:02:13,800 --> 03:02:14,640
You're incredible.

4462
03:02:14,640 --> 03:02:15,720
You're incredibly talented,

4463
03:02:15,720 --> 03:02:17,790
but you're mostly known in the design world.

4464
03:02:17,790 --> 03:02:22,140
Now everyone in the universe, has heard of Neri Oxman.

4465
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:24,690
Okay, we're gonna get this thing cleared up.

4466
03:02:24,690 --> 03:02:27,660
You're gonna be doing an event in six months

4467
03:02:27,660 --> 03:02:29,190
where you're gonna tell the world

4468
03:02:29,190 --> 03:02:30,180
you're gonna go outta stealth mode,

4469
03:02:30,180 --> 03:02:31,800
you're gonna tell the world about all the incredible things

4470
03:02:31,800 --> 03:02:33,570
that you're building and you're designing

4471
03:02:33,570 --> 03:02:35,520
and you're creating

4472
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:37,980
and it's gonna be like the iPhone launch.

4473
03:02:37,980 --> 03:02:39,780
'Cause everyone's gonna be paying attention

4474
03:02:39,780 --> 03:02:42,450
and they're gonna wanna see your work.

4475
03:02:42,450 --> 03:02:44,760
And you know, that's how I try to cheer up.

4476
03:02:44,760 --> 03:02:45,780
But I think it's true.

4477
03:02:45,780 --> 03:02:47,290
- It is true, and you're doing

4478
03:02:48,600 --> 03:02:49,800
your job as a good partner

4479
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:51,800
in seeing the silver lining of all this.

4480
03:02:53,310 --> 03:02:56,650
Just from observing her, how did she

4481
03:02:59,070 --> 03:03:01,410
stay strong through all of this psychologically?

4482
03:03:01,410 --> 03:03:04,650
'Cause at least I know she's pushing ahead with the work.

4483
03:03:04,650 --> 03:03:06,150
- Oh, she's full speed ahead in her work.

4484
03:03:06,150 --> 03:03:07,140
She's built an amazing team.

4485
03:03:07,140 --> 03:03:11,550
She's hired 30 scientists, roboticists,

4486
03:03:11,550 --> 03:03:14,940
people who, biologists, plant specialists,

4487
03:03:14,940 --> 03:03:18,120
material scientists, engineers,

4488
03:03:18,120 --> 03:03:19,920
really incredible crew.

4489
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:22,230
She's built this 36,000 square foot lab in New York City.

4490
03:03:22,230 --> 03:03:23,370
That's a one of a kind.

4491
03:03:23,370 --> 03:03:25,170
It's still, they're working out of it.

4492
03:03:25,170 --> 03:03:26,100
It's still under construction

4493
03:03:26,100 --> 03:03:27,503
while they're working out of it.

4494
03:03:28,800 --> 03:03:30,810
And so she's gonna do amazing things.

4495
03:03:30,810 --> 03:03:34,860
But as I said, she's an extremely sensitive person.

4496
03:03:34,860 --> 03:03:36,750
She's a perfectionist. Okay?

4497
03:03:36,750 --> 03:03:39,510
Imagine thinking that the entire world

4498
03:03:39,510 --> 03:03:41,670
thinks you committed academic fraud.

4499
03:03:41,670 --> 03:03:44,070
And so that was very hard for her.

4500
03:03:44,070 --> 03:03:45,480
She's a very positive person.

4501
03:03:45,480 --> 03:03:50,480
But I saw her, and I would say her darkest emotional period

4502
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:54,060
for sure, she's doing much better now.

4503
03:03:54,060 --> 03:03:55,473
But you can kill someone,

4504
03:03:56,310 --> 03:03:59,253
you can kill someone with by destroying their reputation.

4505
03:04:00,300 --> 03:04:01,560
People commit suicide.

4506
03:04:01,560 --> 03:04:05,640
People go into these deep dark depression.

4507
03:04:05,640 --> 03:04:08,490
- Well, my worry primarily when I saw

4508
03:04:08,490 --> 03:04:09,900
what Business Insider was doing,

4509
03:04:09,900 --> 03:04:14,900
is that they might dim the light

4510
03:04:15,420 --> 03:04:20,220
of a truly special scientist and creator.

4511
03:04:20,220 --> 03:04:21,990
- It's not gonna happen.

4512
03:04:21,990 --> 03:04:26,490
- But I also worry about others like Neri,

4513
03:04:26,490 --> 03:04:30,160
young Neris that this sends a signal to

4514
03:04:31,020 --> 03:04:32,730
that might scare them.

4515
03:04:32,730 --> 03:04:35,670
And you know, journalism

4516
03:04:35,670 --> 03:04:38,220
shouldn't scare aspiring young scientists.

4517
03:04:38,220 --> 03:04:41,970
- The problem is the defamation law in the US

4518
03:04:41,970 --> 03:04:45,990
is so favorable to the publisher, to the media,

4519
03:04:45,990 --> 03:04:50,220
and so unfavorable to the victim.

4520
03:04:50,220 --> 03:04:52,458
And the incentives are all wrong.

4521
03:04:52,458 --> 03:04:53,700
You know when you went from

4522
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:56,340
a paper version of journalism to digital

4523
03:04:56,340 --> 03:04:58,440
and you could track how many people click,

4524
03:04:59,610 --> 03:05:04,380
and it's a medium that advertising drives the economics.

4525
03:05:04,380 --> 03:05:06,900
And if you can show an advertiser more clicks,

4526
03:05:06,900 --> 03:05:08,760
you can make more money.

4527
03:05:08,760 --> 03:05:12,280
So a journalist is incentivized to write a story

4528
03:05:12,280 --> 03:05:13,412
that will generate more clicks.

4529
03:05:13,412 --> 03:05:14,245
How do you write a story that'll generate more clicks?

4530
03:05:15,510 --> 03:05:17,200
You get a billionaire guy

4531
03:05:18,510 --> 03:05:20,490
and then you go after his wife

4532
03:05:20,490 --> 03:05:22,740
and you make a sensationalist story,

4533
03:05:22,740 --> 03:05:25,534
and you give them no time to respond.

4534
03:05:25,534 --> 03:05:26,973
Look at the timing here.

4535
03:05:28,020 --> 03:05:30,790
On the first story they gave us three hours

4536
03:05:31,680 --> 03:05:34,110
on the second one the following day,

4537
03:05:34,110 --> 03:05:36,870
5:19 PM the email comes in, not to Neri,

4538
03:05:36,870 --> 03:05:39,780
not to her firm, but to my communications person

4539
03:05:39,780 --> 03:05:43,458
who tracks us down by 5:30, you know, 10 minutes later.

4540
03:05:43,458 --> 03:05:46,917
And they published their story 92 minutes after.

4541
03:05:46,917 --> 03:05:49,620
And they sent us, we're gonna surface all these documents

4542
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:54,060
in our demand, read the email they sent,

4543
03:05:54,060 --> 03:05:55,810
whether you could even decipher it.

4544
03:05:59,190 --> 03:06:02,910
And by the way there's a reason why academic institutions,

4545
03:06:02,910 --> 03:06:05,130
when a professors accused of plagiarism,

4546
03:06:05,130 --> 03:06:07,350
why they have these very careful processes

4547
03:06:07,350 --> 03:06:09,420
with multiple stages and they take,

4548
03:06:09,420 --> 03:06:12,963
they can take a year or more because it depends on intent.

4549
03:06:13,830 --> 03:06:15,390
Was this intentional?

4550
03:06:15,390 --> 03:06:18,930
In order to be a crime, an academic crime,

4551
03:06:18,930 --> 03:06:21,090
you gotta prove that they intentionally stole.

4552
03:06:21,090 --> 03:06:22,350
Look, in some cases it's obvious.

4553
03:06:22,350 --> 03:06:24,180
In some cases it's very subtle

4554
03:06:24,180 --> 03:06:26,130
and they take this stuff super seriously.

4555
03:06:26,130 --> 03:06:29,520
But they basically accused Neri of academic crime.

4556
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:30,840
And then 92 minutes later

4557
03:06:30,840 --> 03:06:33,270
they said she committed an academic crime

4558
03:06:33,270 --> 03:06:34,620
and that should be a crime

4559
03:06:34,620 --> 03:06:37,710
and that should be punishable with litigation.

4560
03:06:37,710 --> 03:06:39,930
And there should be a real cost

4561
03:06:39,930 --> 03:06:42,293
and we're gonna make sure there's a real cost

4562
03:06:42,293 --> 03:06:44,460
and reputationally and otherwise to Business Insider

4563
03:06:44,460 --> 03:06:45,840
and to Axel Springer

4564
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:48,540
'cause ultimately you gotta look to the controlling owner,

4565
03:06:48,540 --> 03:06:50,580
you know, they're responsible.

4566
03:06:50,580 --> 03:06:52,560
- I'll just say that you in this regard

4567
03:06:52,560 --> 03:06:56,693
are inspiring to me for facing

4568
03:06:58,740 --> 03:07:03,660
basically an institution

4569
03:07:03,660 --> 03:07:08,280
that whole purpose is to write articles.

4570
03:07:08,280 --> 03:07:10,380
So you're like going into the fire.

4571
03:07:10,380 --> 03:07:13,230
- My kid's school, the epithet of the school,

4572
03:07:13,230 --> 03:07:16,573
or the saying is go forth unafraid.

4573
03:07:16,573 --> 03:07:18,510
I think it's a good way to live.

4574
03:07:18,510 --> 03:07:21,480
And again, the words can't harm me.

4575
03:07:21,480 --> 03:07:24,930
You know the power of X

4576
03:07:24,930 --> 03:07:29,883
and we do owe Elon enormous thanks for this is now...

4577
03:07:31,320 --> 03:07:32,550
So for example, the Washington Post

4578
03:07:32,550 --> 03:07:34,860
wrote a story about me a couple days ago,

4579
03:07:34,860 --> 03:07:38,850
and I didn't think the story was a fair story.

4580
03:07:38,850 --> 03:07:41,520
So within a few hours of the story being written,

4581
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:44,254
I'm able to put out a response to the story

4582
03:07:44,254 --> 03:07:46,380
and send it to 1,000,200 thousand people.

4583
03:07:46,380 --> 03:07:48,900
And it gets read and reread.

4584
03:07:48,900 --> 03:07:50,790
I haven't checked, but probably

4585
03:07:50,790 --> 03:07:53,310
5 million people saw my response.

4586
03:07:53,310 --> 03:07:54,750
Now those are the people on X.

4587
03:07:54,750 --> 03:07:56,970
It's not everyone in the world.

4588
03:07:56,970 --> 03:07:59,247
There's a disconnection between the X world

4589
03:07:59,247 --> 03:08:00,693
and the offline world.

4590
03:08:01,800 --> 03:08:06,800
But reputation in my business is basically all you have.

4591
03:08:06,810 --> 03:08:09,060
And as they say, you can take a lifetime

4592
03:08:09,060 --> 03:08:09,960
to build a reputation

4593
03:08:09,960 --> 03:08:11,430
and take five minutes to have it disappear.

4594
03:08:11,430 --> 03:08:13,740
And the media plays a very important role

4595
03:08:13,740 --> 03:08:15,213
and they can destroy people.

4596
03:08:16,170 --> 03:08:18,870
At least we now have some ability to fight back.

4597
03:08:18,870 --> 03:08:21,270
We have a platform, we can surface our views.

4598
03:08:21,270 --> 03:08:22,800
The typical old days

4599
03:08:22,800 --> 03:08:24,210
they write an incredibly deming article

4600
03:08:24,210 --> 03:08:25,710
and you point out factual errors

4601
03:08:25,710 --> 03:08:26,730
and then like two months later

4602
03:08:26,730 --> 03:08:28,710
they bury a little correction on page whatever

4603
03:08:28,710 --> 03:08:29,910
by then the person was fired

4604
03:08:29,910 --> 03:08:31,950
or their life was destroyed

4605
03:08:31,950 --> 03:08:33,810
or the reputation's damaged.

4606
03:08:33,810 --> 03:08:36,030
You know, it was with Warren Buffet talking about media.

4607
03:08:36,030 --> 03:08:39,000
And it's something he, a business he really loves.

4608
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:40,860
He says, you know what Bill?

4609
03:08:40,860 --> 03:08:42,900
He said, a thief with a dagger.

4610
03:08:42,900 --> 03:08:44,400
The only person who cause you more harm

4611
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:47,400
than a thief with a dagger is a journalist with a pen.

4612
03:08:47,400 --> 03:08:50,670
And those were very powerful words.

4613
03:08:50,670 --> 03:08:54,600
- So you think X formerly known as Twitter, is a kind

4614
03:08:54,600 --> 03:08:56,700
of neutralizing force to that,

4615
03:08:56,700 --> 03:09:00,090
to the power of centralized journalistic institutions?

4616
03:09:00,090 --> 03:09:01,020
- A hundred percent.

4617
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:02,610
And I think it's a really important one,

4618
03:09:02,610 --> 03:09:05,190
and it's really been eye-opening for me

4619
03:09:05,190 --> 03:09:08,730
to see how stories get covered in mainstream media.

4620
03:09:08,730 --> 03:09:10,020
And then you actually...

4621
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:12,270
What I do on X is I follow people

4622
03:09:12,270 --> 03:09:13,770
on multiple sides of an issue.

4623
03:09:15,750 --> 03:09:19,110
Or I post on a topic and I get to hear the other side.

4624
03:09:19,110 --> 03:09:20,103
I read the replies.

4625
03:09:21,180 --> 03:09:23,760
And the truth is something that people

4626
03:09:23,760 --> 03:09:25,740
have had a lot of question about,

4627
03:09:25,740 --> 03:09:26,990
particularly in the last,

4628
03:09:28,140 --> 03:09:29,580
I would say five years.

4629
03:09:29,580 --> 03:09:30,780
You know, beginning with

4630
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:34,200
Trump's talking about fake news

4631
03:09:34,200 --> 03:09:36,960
and a lot of what Trump said about fake news is true.

4632
03:09:36,960 --> 03:09:39,900
You know the world, a big part of the world hated Trump

4633
03:09:39,900 --> 03:09:43,803
and did everything they could to discredit him, destroy him.

4634
03:09:44,880 --> 03:09:48,540
And he did a lot of things perhaps deserving

4635
03:09:48,540 --> 03:09:49,920
of being discredited,

4636
03:09:49,920 --> 03:09:54,467
used by a very imperfect, in some cases harmful leader.

4637
03:09:55,950 --> 03:09:58,770
But you know, everything from pre-election,

4638
03:09:58,770 --> 03:10:03,660
the Hunter Biden laptop story in the New York Post

4639
03:10:03,660 --> 03:10:07,560
that then Twitter made difficult

4640
03:10:10,110 --> 03:10:12,993
for people to share and to read.

4641
03:10:16,535 --> 03:10:18,247
COVID, you know, the Jay Bhattacharya of the world

4642
03:10:20,520 --> 03:10:23,370
questioning the government's response,

4643
03:10:23,370 --> 03:10:27,750
questioning long-term lockdowns,

4644
03:10:27,750 --> 03:10:29,850
questioning keeping kids outta school,

4645
03:10:29,850 --> 03:10:32,343
questions about masks, about vaccines,

4646
03:10:33,240 --> 03:10:35,340
which are still not definitively answered.

4647
03:10:36,570 --> 03:10:38,760
No counterbalance to the power

4648
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:41,640
of the government when the government can shut down

4649
03:10:41,640 --> 03:10:42,903
avenues for free speech.

4650
03:10:44,760 --> 03:10:46,440
And where the mainstream media has kind of

4651
03:10:46,440 --> 03:10:49,590
towed the line in many extents to the government's action.

4652
03:10:49,590 --> 03:10:51,960
So having a independently owned

4653
03:10:51,960 --> 03:10:56,910
powerful platform is very important for truth,

4654
03:10:56,910 --> 03:10:59,610
for free speech, for hearing the other side of the story,

4655
03:10:59,610 --> 03:11:02,160
for counterbalancing the power of the government.

4656
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:06,963
Elon is getting a lot of pushback.

4657
03:11:07,800 --> 03:11:09,840
You know, the SpaceXs and Teslas of the world

4658
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:12,450
are experiencing a lot of

4659
03:11:12,450 --> 03:11:16,860
government questions and investigations.

4660
03:11:16,860 --> 03:11:18,780
And even the president of the United States came out

4661
03:11:18,780 --> 03:11:21,153
and said, look, he needs to be investigated.

4662
03:11:22,290 --> 03:11:25,050
I'm getting my own version of that in terms of

4663
03:11:25,050 --> 03:11:26,130
some negative media articles.

4664
03:11:26,130 --> 03:11:27,960
I don't know what's next.

4665
03:11:27,960 --> 03:11:30,510
But yeah, if you stick your neck out in today's world

4666
03:11:30,510 --> 03:11:33,330
and you go against the establishment,

4667
03:11:33,330 --> 03:11:37,950
or at least the existing administration,

4668
03:11:37,950 --> 03:11:40,587
you can find yourself in a very challenged place.

4669
03:11:40,587 --> 03:11:42,990
And that discourages people from sharing stuff.

4670
03:11:42,990 --> 03:11:45,360
And that's why anonymous speech is important.

4671
03:11:45,360 --> 03:11:46,950
Some of what you find on Twitter.

4672
03:11:46,950 --> 03:11:49,953
- You mentioned Trump, I have to talk to you about politics.

4673
03:11:50,880 --> 03:11:52,590
Amongst all the other battles,

4674
03:11:52,590 --> 03:11:54,900
you've also been a part of that one.

4675
03:11:54,900 --> 03:11:56,021
Maybe you can correct me on this,

4676
03:11:56,021 --> 03:11:56,910
but you've been a big supporter

4677
03:11:56,910 --> 03:11:59,310
of various democratic candidates over the years,

4678
03:12:02,430 --> 03:12:05,730
but you did say a lot of nice things

4679
03:12:05,730 --> 03:12:10,110
about Donald Trump in 2016, I believe.

4680
03:12:10,110 --> 03:12:11,490
- So I was interviewed by Andrew Sorkin

4681
03:12:11,490 --> 03:12:14,180
a week after Trump won the election.

4682
03:12:14,180 --> 03:12:15,290
And I made my case for why I thought

4683
03:12:15,290 --> 03:12:16,740
he could be a good president.

4684
03:12:17,580 --> 03:12:19,980
- So what was the case back then?

4685
03:12:19,980 --> 03:12:22,200
To which degree did that turn out to be true

4686
03:12:22,200 --> 03:12:24,720
and to which degree did it not?

4687
03:12:24,720 --> 03:12:26,030
To which degree was he a good president,

4688
03:12:26,030 --> 03:12:28,371
to which degree was he not a good president?

4689
03:12:28,371 --> 03:12:30,930
- I think what I said at the time was

4690
03:12:30,930 --> 03:12:34,347
the United States is actually a huge business.

4691
03:12:34,347 --> 03:12:35,610
And it reminds me a bit of

4692
03:12:35,610 --> 03:12:38,250
the type of activist investments we've taken on over time,

4693
03:12:38,250 --> 03:12:39,600
where this really, really great business

4694
03:12:39,600 --> 03:12:41,190
has kinda lost its way.

4695
03:12:41,190 --> 03:12:43,590
And with the right leadership, we can fix it.

4696
03:12:43,590 --> 03:12:44,690
And if you think about the business

4697
03:12:44,690 --> 03:12:47,130
of the United States today

4698
03:12:47,130 --> 03:12:48,720
you've got $32 trillion worth of debt.

4699
03:12:48,720 --> 03:12:52,770
So it's over leveraged or it's highly leveraged.

4700
03:12:52,770 --> 03:12:54,900
And the leverage is only increasing.

4701
03:12:54,900 --> 03:12:59,730
We're losing money i.e revenues aren't covering expenses.

4702
03:12:59,730 --> 03:13:01,020
The cost of our debt is going up

4703
03:13:01,020 --> 03:13:02,070
as interest rates have gone up

4704
03:13:02,070 --> 03:13:04,050
and the debt has to be rolled over.

4705
03:13:04,050 --> 03:13:08,230
We have enormous administrative bloat in the country.

4706
03:13:09,870 --> 03:13:12,600
The regulatory regime is incredibly complicated

4707
03:13:12,600 --> 03:13:14,793
and burdensome and impeding growth.

4708
03:13:16,140 --> 03:13:20,010
Our relations with our competitor nations

4709
03:13:20,010 --> 03:13:23,610
and our friendly nations are far from ideal.

4710
03:13:23,610 --> 03:13:25,860
And those conditions were present in 2020 as well.

4711
03:13:25,860 --> 03:13:28,050
They're just, I would say worse now.

4712
03:13:28,050 --> 03:13:31,470
And I said, look, it's a great thing that we have

4713
03:13:31,470 --> 03:13:33,270
a businessman as president.

4714
03:13:33,270 --> 03:13:36,120
And in my lifetime was really the first businessman

4715
03:13:36,120 --> 03:13:37,680
as opposed to, I mean, maybe Bush

4716
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:40,380
to some degree was a business person,

4717
03:13:40,380 --> 03:13:43,950
but I thought, okay, I always wanted the CEO to be

4718
03:13:43,950 --> 03:13:46,363
CEO of America and now we have Trump.

4719
03:13:46,363 --> 03:13:48,450
I said, look, he's got some personal qualities

4720
03:13:48,450 --> 03:13:51,030
that seem less ideal,

4721
03:13:51,030 --> 03:13:52,530
but he's gonna be president of the United States.

4722
03:13:52,530 --> 03:13:53,820
He's gonna rise to the occasion.

4723
03:13:53,820 --> 03:13:58,440
This is gonna be his legacy and he knows how to make deals

4724
03:13:58,440 --> 03:14:01,110
and he's gonna recruit some great people

4725
03:14:01,110 --> 03:14:02,760
into his administration. I hoped.

4726
03:14:03,960 --> 03:14:06,780
And growth can solve a lot of our problems.

4727
03:14:06,780 --> 03:14:09,390
So if we can get rid of a bunch of regulations

4728
03:14:09,390 --> 03:14:11,010
that are holding back the country,

4729
03:14:11,010 --> 03:14:14,730
we can have a President Obama was a,

4730
03:14:14,730 --> 03:14:16,980
I would say not a pro business president.

4731
03:14:16,980 --> 03:14:18,930
He did not love the business community.

4732
03:14:18,930 --> 03:14:20,673
He did not love successful people.

4733
03:14:21,690 --> 03:14:24,910
And having a president who just changed the tone

4734
03:14:26,010 --> 03:14:28,020
on being a pro-business president,

4735
03:14:28,020 --> 03:14:29,250
I thought would be good for the country.

4736
03:14:29,250 --> 03:14:30,990
And that's basically what I said.

4737
03:14:30,990 --> 03:14:33,820
And I would say Trump did a lot of good things

4738
03:14:34,950 --> 03:14:36,510
and a lot of people you can get criticized

4739
03:14:36,510 --> 03:14:38,400
for acknowledging that.

4740
03:14:38,400 --> 03:14:41,550
But you know, I think the country's economy

4741
03:14:41,550 --> 03:14:43,170
accelerated dramatically.

4742
03:14:43,170 --> 03:14:44,580
And that, by the way, you know,

4743
03:14:44,580 --> 03:14:48,030
the capitalist system helps the people at the bottom

4744
03:14:48,030 --> 03:14:49,230
best when the system does well

4745
03:14:49,230 --> 03:14:51,189
and when the economy does well.

4746
03:14:51,189 --> 03:14:54,270
You know, the black unemployment rate was lowest in history

4747
03:14:54,270 --> 03:14:55,290
when Trump was president,

4748
03:14:55,290 --> 03:14:58,290
and that's true for other minority groups.

4749
03:14:58,290 --> 03:14:59,790
So he was good for the economy

4750
03:15:00,960 --> 03:15:05,220
and he recognized some of the challenges

4751
03:15:05,220 --> 03:15:07,203
and issues and threats of China early.

4752
03:15:08,400 --> 03:15:10,500
He kind of woke up NATO.

4753
03:15:10,500 --> 03:15:12,360
Now again, the way he did all this stuff

4754
03:15:12,360 --> 03:15:15,030
you can object to, but you know,

4755
03:15:15,030 --> 03:15:18,300
NATO actually started spending more money on defense

4756
03:15:18,300 --> 03:15:20,160
in the early part of Trump's presidency

4757
03:15:20,160 --> 03:15:21,930
because of his threats,

4758
03:15:21,930 --> 03:15:23,160
which turned out to be a good thing

4759
03:15:23,160 --> 03:15:28,160
in light of the ultimately the Russia, Ukraine war.

4760
03:15:28,200 --> 03:15:30,420
And I think if you analyze Trump objectively

4761
03:15:30,420 --> 03:15:33,220
based on policies, he did a lot of good for the country.

4762
03:15:34,140 --> 03:15:38,283
I think what's bad is he did some harm as well.

4763
03:15:40,890 --> 03:15:44,790
I do think civility disappeared in America

4764
03:15:44,790 --> 03:15:45,660
with Trump as president.

4765
03:15:45,660 --> 03:15:48,270
A lot of that's his personal style.

4766
03:15:48,270 --> 03:15:49,813
And how important is civility?

4767
03:15:49,813 --> 03:15:50,646
I do think it's important.

4768
03:15:50,646 --> 03:15:54,390
I do think, you know, he was attacked very aggressively

4769
03:15:54,390 --> 03:15:58,500
by the left, by the media that made him paranoid.

4770
03:15:58,500 --> 03:16:01,530
It probably interfered with his ability to be successful.

4771
03:16:01,530 --> 03:16:05,928
He had the Russian collusion investigation overhang.

4772
03:16:05,928 --> 03:16:07,890
And when someone's attacked,

4773
03:16:07,890 --> 03:16:09,090
they're not gonna be at their best,

4774
03:16:09,090 --> 03:16:10,350
particularly if they're paranoid.

4775
03:16:10,350 --> 03:16:12,333
I think there's some degree of that.

4776
03:16:12,333 --> 03:16:14,918
But I'm giving kind of the best

4777
03:16:14,918 --> 03:16:16,620
of defense of Trump.

4778
03:16:16,620 --> 03:16:21,620
You know, just you look at how he managed his team, right?

4779
03:16:22,800 --> 03:16:25,230
Very few people made it through the Trump administration

4780
03:16:25,230 --> 03:16:27,450
without getting fired or quitting.

4781
03:16:27,450 --> 03:16:29,460
And he would say they're the greatest person in the world

4782
03:16:29,460 --> 03:16:30,293
when he hired them

4783
03:16:30,293 --> 03:16:33,600
and they're total disaster when he fired them.

4784
03:16:33,600 --> 03:16:36,120
It's not an inspiring way to be a leader

4785
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:38,373
and to attract really talented people.

4786
03:16:39,288 --> 03:16:42,333
I think the events surrounding the election,

4787
03:16:43,950 --> 03:16:45,780
I think January 6th, he could have done a lot more

4788
03:16:45,780 --> 03:16:47,910
to stop a riot.

4789
03:16:47,910 --> 03:16:50,580
I don't consider it an insurrection,

4790
03:16:50,580 --> 03:16:53,040
but a riot that takes place in our capitol.

4791
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:57,990
And where police officers are killed or die, commit suicide

4792
03:16:57,990 --> 03:17:01,260
'cause for failure to, as they sought to do their job.

4793
03:17:01,260 --> 03:17:03,030
He stepped in way too late to stop that.

4794
03:17:03,030 --> 03:17:04,170
He could have stopped it early.

4795
03:17:04,170 --> 03:17:07,170
You know, many of his words I think inspired people,

4796
03:17:07,170 --> 03:17:09,180
Some of whom with mal intent

4797
03:17:09,180 --> 03:17:10,680
to go in there and cause harm

4798
03:17:10,680 --> 03:17:12,360
and literally to shut down the government.

4799
03:17:12,360 --> 03:17:15,393
There were some evil people unfortunately there.

4800
03:17:16,260 --> 03:17:18,360
So he's been a very imperfect president

4801
03:17:18,360 --> 03:17:21,670
and also I think contributed to the

4802
03:17:22,800 --> 03:17:24,720
extreme amount of divisiveness in our country.

4803
03:17:24,720 --> 03:17:26,680
So I was ultimately disappointed

4804
03:17:27,900 --> 03:17:30,240
by the note of optimism.

4805
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:34,020
And again, I always support the president.

4806
03:17:34,020 --> 03:17:36,960
I trust the people ultimately to select our next leader.

4807
03:17:36,960 --> 03:17:38,220
You know, it's a bit like

4808
03:17:38,220 --> 03:17:39,300
who wants to be a millionaire.

4809
03:17:39,300 --> 03:17:40,230
When you go to the crowd

4810
03:17:40,230 --> 03:17:42,480
and the crowd says a certain thing,

4811
03:17:42,480 --> 03:17:43,780
you gotta trust the crowd.

4812
03:17:44,910 --> 03:17:47,490
But usually in who wants to be a millionaire,

4813
03:17:47,490 --> 03:17:48,870
it's a landslide in one direction.

4814
03:17:48,870 --> 03:17:51,870
So, you know which letter to pick.

4815
03:17:51,870 --> 03:17:53,490
Here we had an incredibly close election

4816
03:17:53,490 --> 03:17:54,390
which itself is a problem.

4817
03:17:54,390 --> 03:17:57,420
So my dream and what I've tried a little bit,

4818
03:17:57,420 --> 03:17:59,700
played politics in the last little period

4819
03:17:59,700 --> 03:18:01,410
to support some alternatives to Trump

4820
03:18:01,410 --> 03:18:02,970
so that we have a president.

4821
03:18:02,970 --> 03:18:06,540
I use the example, imagine you woke up in the morning,

4822
03:18:06,540 --> 03:18:08,820
it's election day, whatever it is, this November 4th,

4823
03:18:08,820 --> 03:18:11,940
whatever, 2024.

4824
03:18:11,940 --> 03:18:13,500
And you still haven't figured out who to vote for.

4825
03:18:13,500 --> 03:18:16,210
'Cause the candidates are so appealing that

4826
03:18:17,100 --> 03:18:18,480
you don't know which lever to pull

4827
03:18:18,480 --> 03:18:20,460
because it's a tough call.

4828
03:18:20,460 --> 03:18:23,190
That's the choice we should be making as Americans.

4829
03:18:23,190 --> 03:18:24,120
It shouldn't be,

4830
03:18:24,120 --> 03:18:24,957
I'm a member of this party

4831
03:18:24,957 --> 03:18:26,424
and I'm only gonna vote this way.

4832
03:18:26,424 --> 03:18:27,257
I'm a member of that party,

4833
03:18:27,257 --> 03:18:28,090
I'm gonna vote the other way

4834
03:18:28,090 --> 03:18:29,400
and I hate the other side.

4835
03:18:29,400 --> 03:18:31,440
And that's where we've been unfortunately for too long.

4836
03:18:31,440 --> 03:18:34,443
- Or you might be torn because both candidates are not good.

4837
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:36,960
So you wanna...

4838
03:18:36,960 --> 03:18:39,210
I love a future where I'm torn

4839
03:18:39,210 --> 03:18:42,240
because the choices are so amazing.

4840
03:18:42,240 --> 03:18:44,700
- The problem is the party system is so screwed up

4841
03:18:44,700 --> 03:18:46,680
and the parties are self interested

4842
03:18:46,680 --> 03:18:49,773
and there's another governance problem,

4843
03:18:50,700 --> 03:18:51,963
an incentive problem.

4844
03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:54,960
Michael Porter, who was one of my professors

4845
03:18:54,960 --> 03:18:57,780
at Harvard Business School wrote a brilliant piece

4846
03:18:57,780 --> 03:18:59,790
on the American political system

4847
03:18:59,790 --> 03:19:01,770
and all the incentives and market dynamics

4848
03:19:01,770 --> 03:19:04,650
and what he called it competitive analysis.

4849
03:19:04,650 --> 03:19:06,660
And it's a must read, I should dig it up

4850
03:19:06,660 --> 03:19:09,450
and send it around on X.

4851
03:19:09,450 --> 03:19:12,240
But it explains how the parties

4852
03:19:12,240 --> 03:19:16,980
and the incentives of these sort of self-sustaining entities

4853
03:19:16,980 --> 03:19:19,620
where the people involved are not incentivized

4854
03:19:19,620 --> 03:19:22,260
to do what's best for the country, it's a problem.

4855
03:19:22,260 --> 03:19:24,760
- You've been a supporter of Dean Phillips

4856
03:19:25,650 --> 03:19:28,530
for the 2024 US presidential race?

4857
03:19:28,530 --> 03:19:29,363
- Yes.

4858
03:19:29,363 --> 03:19:31,080
- What do you like about Dean?

4859
03:19:31,080 --> 03:19:35,070
- I think he's a honest, smart, motivated,

4860
03:19:35,070 --> 03:19:38,670
capable, proven guy as a business leader.

4861
03:19:38,670 --> 03:19:42,090
And I think in six, almost

4862
03:19:42,090 --> 03:19:44,130
in his three terms in Congress,

4863
03:19:44,130 --> 03:19:46,560
he ran, when Trump was elected,

4864
03:19:46,560 --> 03:19:47,940
he said his kids cried,

4865
03:19:47,940 --> 03:19:49,470
his daughters cried,

4866
03:19:49,470 --> 03:19:51,870
inspired him to run for office.

4867
03:19:51,870 --> 03:19:54,180
Ran in a republican district in Minnesota

4868
03:19:54,180 --> 03:19:57,300
for the last 60 years, was elected in the landslide,

4869
03:19:57,300 --> 03:19:59,070
has been reelected twice,

4870
03:19:59,070 --> 03:20:00,820
moved up the ranks in the Congress,

4871
03:20:03,180 --> 03:20:05,850
respected by his fellow members of Congress,

4872
03:20:05,850 --> 03:20:09,780
advance some important legislation during COVID

4873
03:20:09,780 --> 03:20:13,920
on senior roles on various foreign policy committees.

4874
03:20:13,920 --> 03:20:16,020
Centrist, you know,

4875
03:20:16,020 --> 03:20:17,820
considered I think the second most

4876
03:20:17,820 --> 03:20:19,710
bipartisan member of the Congress.

4877
03:20:19,710 --> 03:20:21,660
I'd love to have a bipartisan president.

4878
03:20:21,660 --> 03:20:23,820
That's the only way to get kind of go forward

4879
03:20:23,820 --> 03:20:26,700
but we'd enormously benefit if we had a president

4880
03:20:26,700 --> 03:20:30,120
that chose policies on the basis

4881
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:31,110
of what's best for the country

4882
03:20:31,110 --> 03:20:32,880
as opposed to what his party wanted.

4883
03:20:32,880 --> 03:20:35,850
What I like about him is he's financially independent.

4884
03:20:35,850 --> 03:20:37,140
He's not a billionaire,

4885
03:20:37,140 --> 03:20:39,330
but he doesn't need the job.

4886
03:20:39,330 --> 03:20:40,830
The party hates him now

4887
03:20:40,830 --> 03:20:43,200
'cause he challenged the king, right?

4888
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:46,260
And so, but he was willing to give up his political career

4889
03:20:46,260 --> 03:20:47,610
'cause what he thought was best for the country.

4890
03:20:47,610 --> 03:20:48,750
He tried to get other people to run

4891
03:20:48,750 --> 03:20:49,800
who were higher profile,

4892
03:20:49,800 --> 03:20:50,850
had more name recognition.

4893
03:20:50,850 --> 03:20:53,463
None would, no one wants to challenge Biden.

4894
03:20:54,660 --> 03:20:57,210
If they wanna have a chance to stay in office

4895
03:20:57,210 --> 03:20:58,383
or run in the future,

4896
03:20:59,280 --> 03:21:01,080
but he's very principled.

4897
03:21:01,080 --> 03:21:02,980
I think he would be a great president,

4898
03:21:03,930 --> 03:21:08,002
but he needs his shot is Michigan,

4899
03:21:08,002 --> 03:21:10,770
but he needs to raise money in order to,

4900
03:21:10,770 --> 03:21:12,210
he's only got a couple weeks

4901
03:21:12,210 --> 03:21:13,380
and he's gotta be on TV there.

4902
03:21:13,380 --> 03:21:15,000
That's expensive.

4903
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:16,680
So we'll see.

4904
03:21:16,680 --> 03:21:18,120
- So he has to increase name recognition

4905
03:21:18,120 --> 03:21:18,953
all that kind of stuff.

4906
03:21:18,953 --> 03:21:20,910
Also, as should mention, he's young.

4907
03:21:20,910 --> 03:21:23,010
- Yeah, he's 55, but he's a young 55.

4908
03:21:23,010 --> 03:21:23,993
You see him play hockey.

4909
03:21:23,993 --> 03:21:26,100
- I mean, I guess 55, no matter what

4910
03:21:26,100 --> 03:21:27,480
is a pretty young age.

4911
03:21:27,480 --> 03:21:29,790
- I'm 57. I feel young,

4912
03:21:29,790 --> 03:21:32,580
I can do more pull-ups today than I could as a kid.

4913
03:21:32,580 --> 03:21:34,560
So that's a standard.

4914
03:21:34,560 --> 03:21:36,480
- You're at the top of your tennis game.

4915
03:21:36,480 --> 03:21:38,310
- I'm at the top of my tennis game for sure.

4916
03:21:38,310 --> 03:21:40,140
- Maybe there's someone that would disagree with that.

4917
03:21:40,140 --> 03:21:42,387
- And by the way, the other thing to point out here is,

4918
03:21:42,387 --> 03:21:45,240
and I have been pointing this out as have others,

4919
03:21:45,240 --> 03:21:47,190
Biden is I think is done,

4920
03:21:47,190 --> 03:21:48,420
I mean, it's embarrassing.

4921
03:21:48,420 --> 03:21:49,800
It's embarrassing for the country

4922
03:21:49,800 --> 03:21:52,680
having him as a presidential candidate,

4923
03:21:52,680 --> 03:21:54,570
let alone the president of the country.

4924
03:21:54,570 --> 03:21:59,550
It's crazy. And it's just gonna get worse and worse.

4925
03:21:59,550 --> 03:22:03,300
And he should hit the worst of his legacy

4926
03:22:03,300 --> 03:22:06,900
is his ego that prevents him from stepping aside

4927
03:22:06,900 --> 03:22:09,060
and that's it, it's his ego.

4928
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:12,663
And it is so wrong and so bad and so embarrassing.

4929
03:22:14,400 --> 03:22:16,080
You talk to people, I was in Europe,

4930
03:22:16,080 --> 03:22:19,200
I was in London a few days ago,

4931
03:22:19,200 --> 03:22:20,033
and people are like,

4932
03:22:20,033 --> 03:22:22,950
"Bill, how can this guy be a president?"

4933
03:22:22,950 --> 03:22:24,480
And it's a bit like,

4934
03:22:24,480 --> 03:22:25,920
again, I go back to my business analogy.

4935
03:22:25,920 --> 03:22:28,560
Being a CEO is like a full contact sport.

4936
03:22:28,560 --> 03:22:29,790
Being president of the United States

4937
03:22:29,790 --> 03:22:32,820
is like some combination of wrestling,

4938
03:22:32,820 --> 03:22:35,366
marathon, running, you know,

4939
03:22:35,366 --> 03:22:36,510
being a triathlete.

4940
03:22:36,510 --> 03:22:39,930
I mean, you gotta be at the serious physical shape

4941
03:22:39,930 --> 03:22:42,510
and at the top of your game to represent this country.

4942
03:22:42,510 --> 03:22:44,520
And he is a far cry from that.

4943
03:22:44,520 --> 03:22:47,370
And it's just getting worse and it's embarrassing.

4944
03:22:47,370 --> 03:22:49,710
And he cannot be.

4945
03:22:49,710 --> 03:22:51,750
And by the way, every day he waits,

4946
03:22:51,750 --> 03:22:54,480
he's handing the election to Trump

4947
03:22:54,480 --> 03:22:56,130
because it's harder and harder

4948
03:22:56,130 --> 03:22:58,080
for an alternative candidate to surface.

4949
03:22:58,080 --> 03:23:00,660
Now Dean is the only candidate left

4950
03:23:00,660 --> 03:23:03,240
on the Democratic side that can still win delegates.

4951
03:23:03,240 --> 03:23:05,103
He's on the ballot in 42 states.

4952
03:23:06,120 --> 03:23:08,850
And the best way for Biden to step aside

4953
03:23:08,850 --> 03:23:11,130
is for Dean to show well in Michigan.

4954
03:23:11,130 --> 03:23:12,750
- And so you think there is a path

4955
03:23:12,750 --> 03:23:14,400
with the delegates and all that kind of stuff?

4956
03:23:14,400 --> 03:23:15,233
- A hundred percent.

4957
03:23:15,233 --> 03:23:18,090
So what has to happen is,

4958
03:23:18,090 --> 03:23:22,890
New Hampshire, he went from zero to 20% of the vote

4959
03:23:22,890 --> 03:23:25,890
and 10 weeks with no name recognition.

4960
03:23:25,890 --> 03:23:26,723
I helped a little bit.

4961
03:23:26,723 --> 03:23:29,070
Elon helped, we did a spaces for him.

4962
03:23:29,070 --> 03:23:31,290
We had 350,000 people on the spaces.

4963
03:23:31,290 --> 03:23:34,080
Some originally 40,000 live or something

4964
03:23:34,080 --> 03:23:35,643
and then the rest after.

4965
03:23:36,750 --> 03:23:38,670
And then he was on the ground in New Hampshire.

4966
03:23:38,670 --> 03:23:40,350
And New Hampshire is one of the states where

4967
03:23:40,350 --> 03:23:41,640
you don't need to be registered

4968
03:23:41,640 --> 03:23:43,620
to a party to vote for the candidate.

4969
03:23:43,620 --> 03:23:46,170
So it's like jump ball and he got 20%.

4970
03:23:46,170 --> 03:23:48,600
And that's with a lot of independence.

4971
03:23:48,600 --> 03:23:50,253
And Democrats voting for Haley.

4972
03:23:52,170 --> 03:23:55,083
Haley who I like and who I've supported,

4973
03:23:56,190 --> 03:23:58,650
does not look like she's gonna make it.

4974
03:23:58,650 --> 03:24:01,110
Trump is really kind of running the table.

4975
03:24:01,110 --> 03:24:04,950
And so vote for Haley as an independent Michigan,

4976
03:24:04,950 --> 03:24:06,570
maybe throw away your vote.

4977
03:24:06,570 --> 03:24:08,250
I think it increases the likelihood

4978
03:24:08,250 --> 03:24:11,040
that Dean can get those independent votes

4979
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:14,790
if he could theoretically, again, he needs money.

4980
03:24:14,790 --> 03:24:16,110
He could beat Biden in Michigan.

4981
03:24:16,110 --> 03:24:17,670
Biden's doing very poorly in Michigan.

4982
03:24:17,670 --> 03:24:18,960
His polls are terrible.

4983
03:24:18,960 --> 03:24:21,660
The Muslim community is not happy with him

4984
03:24:21,660 --> 03:24:25,680
and he really has spent no time there.

4985
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:28,080
And so if he's embarrassed in Michigan,

4986
03:24:28,080 --> 03:24:29,610
it could be a catalyst for him withdrawing.

4987
03:24:29,610 --> 03:24:30,870
Then Dean will get funding.

4988
03:24:30,870 --> 03:24:34,290
If he wins Michigan or shows well in Michigan

4989
03:24:34,290 --> 03:24:35,640
and people say he's viable

4990
03:24:35,640 --> 03:24:37,920
or he's the only choice we have.

4991
03:24:37,920 --> 03:24:39,870
He'll attract from the center,

4992
03:24:39,870 --> 03:24:42,540
he'll attract from Republicans who won't vote for Trump,

4993
03:24:42,540 --> 03:24:44,010
in which they're a big percentage.

4994
03:24:44,010 --> 03:24:45,360
Could be 60% or more.

4995
03:24:45,360 --> 03:24:47,940
It could be 70% won't vote for Trump

4996
03:24:47,940 --> 03:24:49,950
and also from the Democrats.

4997
03:24:49,950 --> 03:24:52,320
So I think he's a really interesting candidate,

4998
03:24:52,320 --> 03:24:53,250
but we gotta get the word out.

4999
03:24:53,250 --> 03:24:55,020
- I gotten a chance to chat with Dean.

5000
03:24:55,020 --> 03:24:55,853
I really like him.

5001
03:24:55,853 --> 03:24:56,686
I really like him.

5002
03:24:56,686 --> 03:25:00,360
And I think the next president of the United States

5003
03:25:00,360 --> 03:25:03,390
is gonna have to meet

5004
03:25:03,390 --> 03:25:06,630
and speak regularly with Zelensky, Putin

5005
03:25:06,630 --> 03:25:08,670
and Netanyahu, with world leaders

5006
03:25:08,670 --> 03:25:12,630
and have some of the most historic conversations,

5007
03:25:12,630 --> 03:25:14,820
agreements, negotiations.

5008
03:25:14,820 --> 03:25:17,253
And I just don't see Biden doing that.

5009
03:25:18,180 --> 03:25:23,180
And not for any reason, but sadly age.

5010
03:25:23,315 --> 03:25:25,680
- Yeah, I mean, think about it this way.

5011
03:25:25,680 --> 03:25:28,920
When Biden's in present now you saw his recent

5012
03:25:28,920 --> 03:25:30,750
impromptu press conference,

5013
03:25:30,750 --> 03:25:34,530
which he did after the special prosecutor report

5014
03:25:34,530 --> 03:25:37,620
basically saying the guy was way past his prime

5015
03:25:37,620 --> 03:25:40,110
and then he confused the president of Mexico

5016
03:25:40,110 --> 03:25:42,120
and the president of Egypt.

5017
03:25:42,120 --> 03:25:44,790
So they're very careful when they roll him out

5018
03:25:44,790 --> 03:25:47,760
and he's scripted and he's always reading from a lectern.

5019
03:25:47,760 --> 03:25:50,910
Imagine the care they have in exposing him

5020
03:25:50,910 --> 03:25:53,160
and when they expose him, it's terrible.

5021
03:25:53,160 --> 03:25:54,710
Imagine how bad it is for real.

5022
03:25:55,590 --> 03:25:56,583
- It's not good.

5023
03:25:57,570 --> 03:25:58,860
- Really bad for America.

5024
03:25:58,860 --> 03:26:01,530
And I'm upset with him and upset with his family.

5025
03:26:01,530 --> 03:26:03,210
I'm upset with his wife.

5026
03:26:03,210 --> 03:26:05,940
You know, this is the time where the people closest to you

5027
03:26:05,940 --> 03:26:07,140
have to put their arms around you

5028
03:26:07,140 --> 03:26:12,140
and say, dad, honey, you've done your thing.

5029
03:26:13,890 --> 03:26:15,090
This is gonna be your legacy

5030
03:26:15,090 --> 03:26:16,620
and it's not gonna be a good one.

5031
03:26:16,620 --> 03:26:19,080
- Great leaders should also know when to step down.

5032
03:26:19,080 --> 03:26:21,300
- Yeah. One of the best tests of a leader

5033
03:26:21,300 --> 03:26:23,460
is succession planning.

5034
03:26:23,460 --> 03:26:26,310
This is a massive failure of succession planning.

5035
03:26:26,310 --> 03:26:27,730
- Outside of politics

5036
03:26:28,920 --> 03:26:32,160
let me look to the future first,

5037
03:26:32,160 --> 03:26:35,073
in terms of the financial world,

5038
03:26:36,030 --> 03:26:40,050
what are you looking forward to in the next couple of years?

5039
03:26:40,050 --> 03:26:41,550
You have a new fund,

5040
03:26:41,550 --> 03:26:45,183
like what are you thinking about in terms of investment,

5041
03:26:46,500 --> 03:26:49,650
your own and the entire economy

5042
03:26:49,650 --> 03:26:52,860
and maybe even the economy of the world?

5043
03:26:52,860 --> 03:26:55,800
- Sure. So the SEC doesn't like us

5044
03:26:55,800 --> 03:26:59,430
to talk about new funds that we're launching

5045
03:26:59,430 --> 03:27:00,780
that we filed with the SEC.

5046
03:27:02,010 --> 03:27:04,260
But I would say I do...

5047
03:27:04,260 --> 03:27:06,450
And by the way, if anyone's ever interested in a fund,

5048
03:27:06,450 --> 03:27:07,980
they should always read the prospectus carefully,

5049
03:27:07,980 --> 03:27:08,970
including the risk factors.

5050
03:27:08,970 --> 03:27:10,710
That's very, very important.

5051
03:27:10,710 --> 03:27:13,740
But I like the idea of democratizing

5052
03:27:13,740 --> 03:27:16,293
access to good investors.

5053
03:27:17,430 --> 03:27:19,800
And I think that's an interesting trend.

5054
03:27:19,800 --> 03:27:21,630
So we wanna be part of that trend.

5055
03:27:21,630 --> 03:27:24,270
In terms of financial markets,

5056
03:27:24,270 --> 03:27:27,450
generally, the economy a lot of it's gonna depend

5057
03:27:27,450 --> 03:27:28,650
upon the next leader of the country.

5058
03:27:28,650 --> 03:27:30,810
So we're kind of right back there.

5059
03:27:30,810 --> 03:27:32,250
You know the leadership of the United States

5060
03:27:32,250 --> 03:27:33,300
is important for the US economy,

5061
03:27:33,300 --> 03:27:34,530
it's important for the global economy,

5062
03:27:34,530 --> 03:27:36,130
it's important for global peace.

5063
03:27:37,440 --> 03:27:38,760
And we've gone through a really

5064
03:27:38,760 --> 03:27:41,370
difficult period and it's time.

5065
03:27:41,370 --> 03:27:42,870
We need a break.

5066
03:27:42,870 --> 03:27:44,490
But look, I think the United States

5067
03:27:44,490 --> 03:27:45,960
is an incredibly resilient country.

5068
03:27:45,960 --> 03:27:48,420
We have some incredible moats among them.

5069
03:27:48,420 --> 03:27:49,890
We have the Atlantic and the Pacific,

5070
03:27:49,890 --> 03:27:53,520
and we have peaceful neighbors to the north and the south.

5071
03:27:53,520 --> 03:27:55,740
We're an enormously rich country.

5072
03:27:55,740 --> 03:27:58,140
Capitalism still works effectively here.

5073
03:27:58,140 --> 03:28:00,060
I get optimistic about the world

5074
03:28:00,060 --> 03:28:01,020
when I talk to my friends

5075
03:28:01,020 --> 03:28:02,340
who are either venture capitalists

5076
03:28:02,340 --> 03:28:05,490
or my hobby of backing these young entrepreneurs.

5077
03:28:05,490 --> 03:28:07,680
I talk to a founder of a startup,

5078
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:08,970
if you wanna get optimistic about the world.

5079
03:28:08,970 --> 03:28:12,150
So I think technology is gonna save us.

5080
03:28:12,150 --> 03:28:14,680
I think AI, of course, has its frightening

5081
03:28:15,540 --> 03:28:17,490
terminator like scenarios.

5082
03:28:17,490 --> 03:28:20,370
But I'm gonna take the opposite view

5083
03:28:20,370 --> 03:28:25,020
that this is gonna be a huge enabler of productivity,

5084
03:28:25,020 --> 03:28:27,180
scientific discovery, drug discovery,

5085
03:28:27,180 --> 03:28:28,290
and it's gonna make us healthier,

5086
03:28:28,290 --> 03:28:30,063
happier and better.

5087
03:28:31,141 --> 03:28:34,980
So I do think the internet revolution

5088
03:28:34,980 --> 03:28:36,990
had a lot of good, obviously some bad.

5089
03:28:36,990 --> 03:28:38,850
I think the AI revolution's gonna be similar,

5090
03:28:38,850 --> 03:28:42,180
but we're at this other really interesting juncture

5091
03:28:42,180 --> 03:28:45,450
in the world with technology.

5092
03:28:45,450 --> 03:28:47,880
And we're gonna have to use it for our good.

5093
03:28:47,880 --> 03:28:49,827
On the media front, I'm happy about X

5094
03:28:49,827 --> 03:28:53,340
and I think Elon's gonna be successful here.

5095
03:28:53,340 --> 03:28:54,870
I think advertisers will realize

5096
03:28:54,870 --> 03:28:56,040
it's a really good platform.

5097
03:28:56,040 --> 03:28:58,107
The best way to reach me,

5098
03:28:58,107 --> 03:29:00,723
if you wanna sell something to me is post.

5099
03:29:00,723 --> 03:29:04,170
I've actually bought stuff on some ads in X.

5100
03:29:04,170 --> 03:29:05,520
I don't remember the last time I responded

5101
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:07,620
to a direct response advertising.

5102
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:10,380
You know, in terms of my business,

5103
03:29:10,380 --> 03:29:11,370
I have an incredible team.

5104
03:29:11,370 --> 03:29:13,950
It's tiny. We're one of the smallest firms

5105
03:29:13,950 --> 03:29:15,990
relative to the assets we manage.

5106
03:29:15,990 --> 03:29:20,490
It's a bit like the Navy Seals,

5107
03:29:20,490 --> 03:29:21,813
you know, not the US Army.

5108
03:29:22,680 --> 03:29:24,900
We have only 40 people at Persian Square.

5109
03:29:24,900 --> 03:29:26,550
So it's a tight team.

5110
03:29:26,550 --> 03:29:28,110
I think we'll do great things.

5111
03:29:28,110 --> 03:29:29,760
I think we're early on.

5112
03:29:29,760 --> 03:29:31,743
My ambitions investment wise,

5113
03:29:33,720 --> 03:29:35,160
I've always said I'd like to have a record

5114
03:29:35,160 --> 03:29:36,630
as good as Warren Buffet's.

5115
03:29:36,630 --> 03:29:38,640
The problem is, each year he adds on another year.

5116
03:29:38,640 --> 03:29:40,200
He's now in his 93rd year.

5117
03:29:40,200 --> 03:29:43,827
So I've got 36 more years to just get where he is.

5118
03:29:43,827 --> 03:29:46,680
And I think he's gonna add a lot more years.

5119
03:29:46,680 --> 03:29:49,740
I'm excited about seeing what Neri's gonna produce.

5120
03:29:49,740 --> 03:29:51,750
You know, she's building an incredible company.

5121
03:29:51,750 --> 03:29:53,640
They're trying to solve a lot of problems

5122
03:29:53,640 --> 03:29:57,330
with respect to products and buildings

5123
03:29:57,330 --> 03:29:58,920
and their impact on the environment.

5124
03:29:58,920 --> 03:30:01,560
Her vision is how do we design products

5125
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:04,050
that by virtue of the product's existence,

5126
03:30:04,050 --> 03:30:05,130
the world is a better place.

5127
03:30:05,130 --> 03:30:08,190
You know, today you make,

5128
03:30:08,190 --> 03:30:12,420
her world is a world where the existence of the new car

5129
03:30:12,420 --> 03:30:13,980
actually is better for the environment

5130
03:30:13,980 --> 03:30:15,540
than if the new car hadn't existed.

5131
03:30:15,540 --> 03:30:17,910
And think about that in every product scale,

5132
03:30:17,910 --> 03:30:18,870
that's what she's working on.

5133
03:30:18,870 --> 03:30:20,430
I don't wanna give away too much.

5134
03:30:20,430 --> 03:30:22,860
But you're gonna see some early examples

5135
03:30:22,860 --> 03:30:24,270
of what she's working on.

5136
03:30:24,270 --> 03:30:26,440
So again, I get excited about the future

5137
03:30:29,040 --> 03:30:31,440
and crises are sort of a terrible thing to waste.

5138
03:30:31,440 --> 03:30:32,820
And we've had a number of these here.

5139
03:30:32,820 --> 03:30:35,070
I think this disaster in the Middle East.

5140
03:30:35,070 --> 03:30:37,953
My prediction is the next few months,

5141
03:30:38,970 --> 03:30:40,770
this war will largely be over

5142
03:30:40,770 --> 03:30:42,912
in terms of getting rid of Hamas.

5143
03:30:42,912 --> 03:30:47,912
I think I can envision a world in which Saudi Arabia,

5144
03:30:47,940 --> 03:30:49,920
some of the other Gulf states come together,

5145
03:30:49,920 --> 03:30:50,970
take over the governance

5146
03:30:50,970 --> 03:30:54,600
and reconstruction of Gaza

5147
03:30:54,600 --> 03:30:56,760
security guarantees are put in place.

5148
03:30:56,760 --> 03:30:59,550
The Abraham Accords continue to grow.

5149
03:30:59,550 --> 03:31:02,673
A deal is made, terrorists are ostracized.

5150
03:31:03,720 --> 03:31:08,370
That this October 7th experience on the Harvard,

5151
03:31:08,370 --> 03:31:10,530
Penn, MIT, Columbia,

5152
03:31:10,530 --> 03:31:12,480
unfortunately other campuses

5153
03:31:12,480 --> 03:31:15,693
is a wake up call for universities generally.

5154
03:31:16,710 --> 03:31:19,890
You know people see the problems with DEI,

5155
03:31:19,890 --> 03:31:21,570
but understand the importance of diversity

5156
03:31:21,570 --> 03:31:24,330
and inclusion, but not as a political movement,

5157
03:31:24,330 --> 03:31:28,770
but as a way that we return to a meritocratic world

5158
03:31:28,770 --> 03:31:30,240
where someone's background is relevant

5159
03:31:30,240 --> 03:31:33,660
in understanding their contribution.

5160
03:31:33,660 --> 03:31:36,150
But it's not, we don't have race quotas

5161
03:31:36,150 --> 03:31:38,910
and things that were made illegal years ago

5162
03:31:38,910 --> 03:31:42,360
actually being implemented in organizations on campus.

5163
03:31:42,360 --> 03:31:45,060
So I think there's, if we can go through a corrective phase,

5164
03:31:45,060 --> 03:31:47,640
and I'm an optimist and I hope we get there.

5165
03:31:47,640 --> 03:31:49,920
- So you have hope for the entirety of it.

5166
03:31:49,920 --> 03:31:51,300
Even for Harvard.

5167
03:31:51,300 --> 03:31:53,970
- I have hope, even for Harvard,

5168
03:31:53,970 --> 03:31:54,803
it's generally hard

5169
03:31:54,803 --> 03:31:56,580
to break 400 year old things.

5170
03:31:56,580 --> 03:31:58,140
- Well, I share your hope

5171
03:31:58,140 --> 03:32:02,580
and you are a fascinating mind, a brilliant mind,

5172
03:32:02,580 --> 03:32:04,830
persistent as you like to say.

5173
03:32:04,830 --> 03:32:08,790
And fearless, the fearless part is truly inspiring.

5174
03:32:08,790 --> 03:32:11,520
And this was an incredible conversation. Thank you.

5175
03:32:11,520 --> 03:32:12,960
Thank you for talking today Bill.

5176
03:32:12,960 --> 03:32:14,550
- Thank you Lex.

5177
03:32:14,550 --> 03:32:15,383

5178
03:32:15,383 --> 03:32:17,130

And now let me leave you some words from Jonathan Swift.

5182
03:32:25,770 --> 03:32:29,130
A wise person should have money in their head

5183
03:32:29,130 --> 03:32:30,903
but not in their heart.

5184
03:32:32,220 --> 03:32:35,253
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
