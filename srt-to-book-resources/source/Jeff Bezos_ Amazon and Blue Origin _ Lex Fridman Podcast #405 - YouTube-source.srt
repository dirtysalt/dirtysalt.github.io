1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:03,286
- The following is a conversation with Jeff Bezos,

2
00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:06,322
founder of Amazon and Blue Origin.

3
00:00:06,322 --> 00:00:09,256
This is his first time doing a conversation

4
00:00:09,256 --> 00:00:11,380
of this kind and of this length.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,214
And as he told me, it felt like we could have easily talked

6
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,801
for many more hours, and I'm sure we will.

7
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,856
This is the Lex Fridman podcast.

8
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:23,273
And now, dear friends, here's Jeff Bezos.

9
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,734
You spent a lot of your childhood with your grandfather

10
00:00:27,734 --> 00:00:30,294
on a ranch here in Texas,

11
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:33,057
and I heard you had a lot of work to do around the ranch.

12
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:35,437
So what's the coolest job you remember doing there?

13
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:36,659
- Wow, coolest.

14
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:38,087
- Most interesting.

15
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:39,091
Most memorable.

16
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:40,089
- Most memorable.

17
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:41,308
Most impactful.

18
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:42,999
- And it was a real working ranch.

19
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:46,753
My grand, I spent all my summers on that ranch

20
00:00:46,753 --> 00:00:48,420
from age four to 16.

21
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:52,933
And my grandfather was really taking me to those

22
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,378
in the summers, in the early summers,

23
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:57,658
he was letting me pretend to help on the ranch.

24
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,376
'Cause of course, a 4-year-old is a burden,

25
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:01,233
not a help in real life.

26
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,944
He was really just watching me and taking care of me

27
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:07,996
and be was doing that because my mom was so young.

28
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,953
She had me when she was 17,

29
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,037
and so he was sort of giving her a break.

30
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,433
And my grandmother and my grandfather

31
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,056
would take me for these summers.

32
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:16,251
But as I got a little older,

33
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,718
I actually was helpful on the ranch and I loved it.

34
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:20,193
I was out there,

35
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:23,604
like my grandfather had a huge influence on me,

36
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,516
huge factor in my life.

37
00:01:25,516 --> 00:01:28,895
I did all the jobs you would do on a ranch.

38
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,895
I've fixed windmills and laid fences

39
00:01:33,132 --> 00:01:36,557
and pipelines and you know, done all the things

40
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:38,096
that any rancher would do,

41
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:41,596
vaccinated, the animals, everything.

42
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:44,136
But we had a you know, my grandfather,

43
00:01:44,136 --> 00:01:47,215
after my grandmother died, I was about 12

44
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:48,617
and I kept coming to the ranch.

45
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:51,254
So it was then, it was just him and me, just the two of us.

46
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:55,916
And he was completely addicted to the soap opera,

47
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,673
the Days of Our Lives.

48
00:01:57,673 --> 00:02:00,706
And we would go back to the ranch house every day

49
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:03,980
around 1:00 PM or so to watch days of our lives

50
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,433
like sands through an hourglass.

51
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,974
So are the days of our lives.

52
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:11,296
- Just the image of the two sitting there

53
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:12,953
watching a soap opera as ranchers.

54
00:02:12,953 --> 00:02:14,434
- He had these big, crazy dogs.

55
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,617
It was really a very formative experience for me.

56
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:18,677
But the key thing about it for me,

57
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:21,010
the great gift I got from it

58
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:25,732
was that my grandfather was so resourceful, you know,

59
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:26,895
he did everything himself.

60
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,591
He made his own veterinary tools.

61
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:32,157
He would make needles to suture the cattle up with,

62
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:34,287
like he would find a little piece of wire and heat it up

63
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,239
and pound it thin and drill a hole in it and sharpen it.

64
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,295
So, you know, you learn different things

65
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:41,881
on a ranch than you would learn

66
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,412
you know, growing up in a city.

67
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:44,567
- So self-reliance.

68
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:48,271
- Yeah, like figuring out that you can solve problems

69
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:52,127
with enough persistence and ingenuity.

70
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:55,573
And my grandfather bought a D6 bulldozer,

71
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:58,511
which is a big bulldozer, and he got it for like $5,000.

72
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,392
'cause it was completely broken down.

73
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:04,589
It was like a 1955 Caterpillar, D6 bulldozer

74
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:06,394
knew it would've cost, I don't know,

75
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,012
more than a $100,000.

76
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,887
And we spent an entire summer fixing,

77
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:13,170
like repairing that bulldozer.

78
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,549
And we'd, you know, use mail order

79
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,633
to buy big gears for the transmission.

80
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:18,749
And they'd show up.

81
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:19,873
They'd be too heavy to move,

82
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:21,911
so we'd have to build a crane, you know,

83
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:26,131
just that kind of, kinda that problem solving mentality.

84
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:28,964
He had it so powerfully, you know,

85
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:31,939
he did all of his own.

86
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:35,448
He'd just, he didn't pick up the phone and call somebody.

87
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,370
He would figure it out on his own.

88
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,389
Doing his own veterinary work, you know.

89
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,009
- But just the image of the two of you

90
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,684
fixing a D6 bulldozer and then going in

91
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:46,578
for a little break at 1:00 PM to watch a soap opera.

92
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:48,710
- Laying on the floor.

93
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,093
That's how he watched TV.

94
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:50,926
- Yeah.

95
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,468
- He was a really, really remarkable guy.

96
00:03:52,468 --> 00:03:55,759
- That's how I imagine Clint Eastwood also

97
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,657
in all those westerns.

98
00:03:57,657 --> 00:03:59,788
When he's not doing what he is doing,

99
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,447
he's just watching soap operas.

100
00:04:01,447 --> 00:04:04,325
All right, I read that you fell in love

101
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:05,886
with the idea of space and space exploration

102
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:07,616
when you were five watching Neil Armstrong

103
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:09,283
walking on the moon.

104
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:14,766
So let me ask you to look back at the historical context

105
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,317
and impact of that.

106
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:19,235
So the space race from 1957 to 1969

107
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:25,717
between the Soviet Union and the US was in many ways epic.

108
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:29,216
It was a rapid sequence of dramatic events

109
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:32,075
for satellite to space, for a human to space,

110
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:35,538
for a spacewalk, first uncrewed landing on the moon,

111
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:38,373
then some failures, explosions,

112
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,416
deaths on both sides actually,

113
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,801
and then the first human walking on the moon.

114
00:04:43,801 --> 00:04:46,134
What are some of the more inspiring moments

115
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:47,737
or insights you take away from that time,

116
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:51,120
those few years, that just 12 years?

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,678
- Well, I mean, there's so much inspiring there.

118
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,419
You know, one of the great things to take away from that,

119
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,405
one of the great von Braun quotes is

120
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:04,405
"I have come to use the word impossible with great caution."

121
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:06,044
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

122
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,480
- And so that's kind of the big story of Apollo

123
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,775
is that things, you know, going to the moon

124
00:05:13,775 --> 00:05:17,243
was literally an analogy that people used

125
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:19,002
for something that's impossible.

126
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:21,382
You know, oh yeah, you'll do that when you know,

127
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:22,464
men walk on the moon.

128
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:23,297
- Yeah.

129
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:26,134
- And of course it finally happened.

130
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:29,069
So, you know, I think it was pulled forward in time

131
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:31,513
because of the space race,

132
00:05:31,513 --> 00:05:34,972
I think you know, with the geopolitical implications

133
00:05:34,972 --> 00:05:37,730
and you know, how much resource was put into it,

134
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,902
you know, at the peak, that program was spending,

135
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:43,970
you know, two or 3% of GDP on the Apollo program.

136
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,604
So much resource.

137
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:47,511
I think it was pulled forward in time.

138
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:50,529
You know, we kind of did it ahead

139
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:52,639
of when we quote unquote should have done it.

140
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,472
- Yeah.

141
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:57,022
- And so in that way, it's also a technical marvel.

142
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,971
I mean, it's truly incredible.

143
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:03,109
It's, you know, it's the 20th century version

144
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:04,935
of building the pyramids or something.

145
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:07,530
It's you know, it's an achievement

146
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:09,335
that because it was pulled forward in time

147
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,676
and because it did something

148
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:12,615
that had previously thought impossible,

149
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:14,832
it rightly deserves its place, as you know,

150
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,758
in the pantheon of great human achievements.

151
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:21,293
- And of course, you named the projects The Rockets

152
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:22,971
that Blue Origin is working on

153
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:23,999
after some of the folks involved.

154
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,832
- Yeah.

155
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:26,477
- I don't understand why I didn't say New Gagarin.

156
00:06:26,477 --> 00:06:27,310
is that-

157
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,654
- There's an American bias in the naming.

158
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,653
I apologize.

159
00:06:29,653 --> 00:06:30,808
- It's very strange.

160
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:31,641
- Lex.

161
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,348
- Just asking for a friend.

162
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:34,181
Clarify.

163
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:36,031
- I'm a big fan of Gagarin though.

164
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,864
And in fact, I think his first words in space,

165
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,752
I think are incredible.

166
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:47,692
He, you know, he purportedly said "my God, it's blue."

167
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,643
And that really drives home.

168
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,446
No one had seen the earth from space.

169
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:55,442
No one knew that we were on this blue planet.

170
00:06:55,442 --> 00:06:56,275
- Yeah.

171
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:58,129
- No one knew what it looked like from out there.

172
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,027
And Gagarin was the first person to see it.

173
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:04,114
- One of the things I think about is how dangerous

174
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:06,989
those early days were for Gagarin,

175
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:08,729
for Glen, for everybody involved.

176
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:11,229
Like how big of a risk they were all taking.

177
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:12,429
- They were taking huge risks.

178
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:14,826
I'm not sure what the Soviets thought

179
00:07:14,826 --> 00:07:16,653
about Gagarin's flight,

180
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:19,009
but I think that the Americans thought

181
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,833
that the Alan Shephard flight,

182
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,653
the flight that you know, New Shephard is named after,

183
00:07:22,653 --> 00:07:24,133
the first American in space.

184
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,330
He went on his suborbital flight.

185
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,080
They thought he had about a 75% chance of success.

186
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,080
So, you know, that's a pretty big risk, a 25% risk.

187
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,351
- It's kind of interesting that Alan Shephard

188
00:07:38,351 --> 00:07:40,030
is not quite as famous as John Glenn.

189
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,033
So for people who don't know, Alan Shephard

190
00:07:42,033 --> 00:07:44,707
is the first astronaut-

191
00:07:44,707 --> 00:07:46,491
- The first American in space.

192
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,610
- American in suborbital flight.

193
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,443
- Correct.

194
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,030
- And then the first orbital flight is-

195
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,833
- John Glenn is the first American to orbit the earth.

196
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,048
By the way, I have the most charming, sweet,

197
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:00,987
incredible letter from John Glenn,

198
00:08:00,987 --> 00:08:03,987
which I have framed and hang on my office wall.

199
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:04,991
- What did he say?

200
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:07,807
- Where he tells me how grateful he is

201
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:10,610
that we have named New Glenn after him.

202
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,642
And he sent me that letter about a week before he died.

203
00:08:13,642 --> 00:08:15,806
And it's really an incredible,

204
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,071
it's also a very funny letter.

205
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,392
He's writing and he says you know,

206
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:24,113
this is a letter about New Glenn from the original Glenn.

207
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,983
And he's just, he's got a great sense of humor,

208
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:29,226
and he's very happy about it and grateful.

209
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:30,271
It's very sweet.

210
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:31,810
- Does he say ps don't mess this up?

211
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,727
Or is that-

212
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,140
- No, he doesn't.

213
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,015
- Make me look good.

214
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,158
- He doesn't do that.

215
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:37,991
- Okay.

216
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:38,823
- But wait, but John, wherever you are,

217
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:39,657
we got you covered.

218
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:41,530
- All right, good.

219
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,295
So back to maybe the big picture of space.

220
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:47,912
When you look up at the stars and think big,

221
00:08:47,912 --> 00:08:49,891
what do you hope is the future of humanity?

222
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:54,135
Hundreds, thousands of years from now out in space?

223
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,528
- I would love to see, you know,

224
00:08:56,528 --> 00:09:00,278
a trillion humans living in the solar system.

225
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,251
If we had a trillion humans,

226
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,314
we would have at any given time a thousand Mozarts

227
00:09:06,314 --> 00:09:08,473
and a thousand Einsteins.

228
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,736
That would, you know, our solar system would be full of life

229
00:09:11,736 --> 00:09:14,116
and intelligence and energy.

230
00:09:14,116 --> 00:09:17,773
And we can easily support a civilization that large

231
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:21,314
with all of the resources in the solar system.

232
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,289
- So what do you think that looks like?

233
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:24,633
Giant space stations?

234
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,695
- Yeah, the only way to get to that vision

235
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:28,796
is with giant space stations.

236
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,397
You know, the planetary surfaces are just way too small.

237
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:34,130
So you can, I mean, unless you turn them

238
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,608
into giant space stations or something.

239
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:40,853
But, but yeah, we will take materials from the moon

240
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:44,679
and from near earth objects and from the asteroid belt

241
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:49,091
and so on, and we'll build giant O'Neill style colonies

242
00:09:49,091 --> 00:09:50,919
and people will live in those.

243
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:54,013
And they have a lot of advantages over planetary surfaces.

244
00:09:54,013 --> 00:09:57,734
You can spin them to get normal earth gravity.

245
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,398
You can put them where you want them.

246
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:03,112
I think most people are gonna wanna live near Earth,

247
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:07,808
not necessarily in earth orbit, but in you know, earth,

248
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,700
but near earth vicinity orbits.

249
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,251
And so they can move you know, relatively quickly

250
00:10:15,251 --> 00:10:19,137
back and forth between their station and Earth.

251
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:20,455
So I think a lot of people,

252
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:21,813
especially in the early stages,

253
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:24,894
are not gonna want to give up Earth altogether.

254
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:26,695
- They go to earth for vacation.

255
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:27,528
- Yeah.

256
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,157
Same way that you know, you might go

257
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:31,389
to Yellowstone National Park for vacation.

258
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:33,210
People will, and no one,

259
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,693
and people will get to choose where they live on earth

260
00:10:35,693 --> 00:10:37,853
or whether they live in space,

261
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,575
but they'll be able to use much more energy

262
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,920
and much more material resource in space

263
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,514
than they would be able to use on earth.

264
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,048
- One of the interesting ideas you had

265
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:49,810
is to move the heavy industry away from Earth.

266
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,034
So people sometimes have this idea

267
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:55,912
that somehow space exploration is in conflict

268
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:58,593
with the celebration of the planet earth,

269
00:10:58,593 --> 00:11:00,559
that we should focus on preserving earth.

270
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,321
And basically your ideas that space travel

271
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:06,773
and space exploration is a way to preserve earth.

272
00:11:06,773 --> 00:11:07,872
- Exactly.

273
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:12,872
This planet, we've sent robotic probes to all the planets.

274
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:16,380
We know that this is the good one.

275
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,595
- Yeah.

276
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,088
Not to play favorites or anything.

277
00:11:19,088 --> 00:11:20,850
- But earth really is the good planet.

278
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,258
It's amazing, the ecosystem we have here,

279
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:27,925
all of the life and the lush, the plant life

280
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,764
and you know, the water resources, everything.

281
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:33,273
This planet is really extraordinary.

282
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:35,159
And of course, we evolved on this planet,

283
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,394
so of course it's perfect for us,

284
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:39,670
but it's also perfect for all the advanced life forms

285
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,236
on this planet, all the animals and so on.

286
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,234
And so this is a gem.

287
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:46,038
We do need to take care of it.

288
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,232
And as we enter the Anthropocene,

289
00:11:48,232 --> 00:11:51,013
as we get, as we humans have gotten

290
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:54,430
so sophisticated and large and impactful,

291
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:58,774
as we stride across this planet, you know,

292
00:11:58,774 --> 00:12:01,832
that is going to, as we continue,

293
00:12:01,832 --> 00:12:03,436
we want to use a lot of energy.

294
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:04,956
We want to use a lot of energy per capita.

295
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:07,133
We've gotten amazing things.

296
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,693
We don't want to go backwards.

297
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:13,610
You know, if you think about the good old days,

298
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:17,373
they're mostly an illusion.

299
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:19,237
Like in almost every way,

300
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:21,170
life is better for almost everyone today

301
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,094
than it was say, 50 years ago or a hundred years.

302
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:29,697
We live better lives by and large than our grandparents did,

303
00:12:29,697 --> 00:12:31,636
and their grandparents did, and so on.

304
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,039
And you can see that in global illiteracy rates,

305
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:39,039
global poverty rates, global infant mortality rates,

306
00:12:39,113 --> 00:12:41,174
like almost any metric you choose,

307
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:43,377
we're better off than we used to be.

308
00:12:43,377 --> 00:12:45,255
And we get, you know, antibiotics

309
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:46,776
and all kinds of lifesaving medical care

310
00:12:46,776 --> 00:12:49,070
and so on and so on.

311
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,935
And there's one thing that is moving backwards,

312
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:54,653
and it's the natural world.

313
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:59,653
So it is a fact that 500 years ago, pre-industrial age,

314
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:02,121
the natural world was pristine.

315
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:03,697
It was incredible.

316
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:07,614
And we have traded some of that pristine beauty

317
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,331
for all of these other gifts that we have

318
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:13,513
as an advanced society.

319
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:15,263
And we can have both.

320
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,837
But to do that, we have to go to space.

321
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,375
And all of this, really,

322
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:25,375
the most fundamental measure is energy usage per capita.

323
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,399
And when you look at, you know,

324
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,551
you do want to continue to use more and more energy,

325
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,494
it is going to make your life better in so many ways.

326
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:36,333
But that's not compatible ultimately

327
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,074
with living on a finite planet.

328
00:13:38,074 --> 00:13:40,895
And so we have to go out into the solar system

329
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:44,773
and really you could argue about when you have to do that,

330
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,235
but you can't credibly argue

331
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:49,615
about whether you have to do that.

332
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,157
- Eventually, we have to do that.

333
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:52,314
- Exactly.

334
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,439
- Well, you don't often talk about it,

335
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,990
but let me ask you on that topic about the Blue Ring

336
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,375
and the orbital reef space infrastructure projects.

337
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:03,511
What's your vision for these?

338
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:07,117
- So Blue Ring is a very interesting spacecraft

339
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:11,784
that is designed to take up to 3000 kilograms of payload

340
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:17,075
up to geosynchronous orbit or in lunar vicinity.

341
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:20,253
It has two different kinds of propulsion.

342
00:14:20,253 --> 00:14:24,391
It has chemical propulsion, and it has electric propulsion.

343
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:25,814
And so it can,

344
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:28,996
you can use blue ring in a couple different ways.

345
00:14:28,996 --> 00:14:32,717
You can slowly move, let's say up to geosynchronous orbit

346
00:14:32,717 --> 00:14:34,679
using electric propulsion

347
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:36,838
that might take you know, a hundred days

348
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:40,275
or 150 days depending on how much mass you're carrying.

349
00:14:40,275 --> 00:14:43,171
And then, and reserve your chemical propulsion

350
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,994
so that you can change orbits quickly

351
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,834
in geosynchronous orbit.

352
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,412
Or you can use the chemical propulsion first

353
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,136
to quickly get up to geosynchronous

354
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:53,089
and then use your electrical propulsion

355
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:55,797
to slowly change your geosynchronous orbit.

356
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:59,276
Blue Ring has a couple of interesting features.

357
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,693
It provides a lot of services

358
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,382
to these payloads.

359
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:07,433
So the payload, it could be one large payload,

360
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,312
or it can be a number of small payloads,

361
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:12,336
and it provides thermal management,

362
00:15:12,336 --> 00:15:16,695
it provides electric power, it provides compute,

363
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:19,035
provides communications.

364
00:15:19,035 --> 00:15:23,115
And so when you design a payload for Blue Ring,

365
00:15:23,115 --> 00:15:24,253
you don't have,

366
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:27,237
you don't have to figure out all of those things

367
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:28,236
on your own.

368
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:30,917
So kind of radiation tolerant compute

369
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:32,974
is a complicated thing to do.

370
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:36,438
And so we have an unusually large amount

371
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:39,033
of radiation tolerant compute on board Blue Ring,

372
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:41,639
and you can, your payload can just use that

373
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,690
when it needs to.

374
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,607
So it's sort of all these services,

375
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:49,650
it's you know, it's like a set of APIs.

376
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,676
It's a little bit like Amazon web services,

377
00:15:51,676 --> 00:15:55,055
but for space payloads that need to move about

378
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,795
an earth vicinity or lunar vicinity.

379
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:58,878
- AWSS space.

380
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,005
Okay, so computing space.

381
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:04,836
So you get a giant chemical rocket

382
00:16:04,836 --> 00:16:08,035
to get a payload out to orbit,

383
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,129
and then you have these admins that show up,

384
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:13,810
this Blue Ring thing that manages various things

385
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,643
like compute.

386
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:15,476
- Exactly.

387
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,893
And it can also provide transportation

388
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,012
and move you around to different orbits.

389
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,195
- Including humans, you think?

390
00:16:20,195 --> 00:16:23,726
- No, but Blue Ring is not designed to move humans around.

391
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:26,854
It's designed to move payloads around.

392
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:27,687
- Okay.

393
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,749
- So we're also building a lunar lander,

394
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:33,640
which is of course designed to land humans

395
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,917
on the surface of the moon.

396
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,578
- I'm gonna ask you about that,

397
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,595
but let me ask you to just step back to the old days.

398
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:42,476
You were at Princeton

399
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:45,386
with aspirations to be a theoretical physicist.

400
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:46,219
- Yeah.

401
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,368
- What attracted you to physics

402
00:16:49,368 --> 00:16:51,798
and why did you change your mind

403
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:54,808
and not become, why you're not Jeff Bezos,

404
00:16:54,808 --> 00:16:57,116
the famous theoretical physicist?

405
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,969
- So I loved physics and I studied physics

406
00:16:59,969 --> 00:17:01,638
and computer science,

407
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:05,114
and I was proceeding along the physics path.

408
00:17:05,114 --> 00:17:06,531
I was planning to major in physics

409
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:08,907
and I wanted to be a theoretical physicist.

410
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:10,374
And the computer science

411
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:12,655
was sort of something I was doing for fun.

412
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:14,577
I really loved it.

413
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:17,867
And I was very good at the programming

414
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,674
and doing those things.

415
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:23,035
And I enjoyed all my computer science classes immensely,

416
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:26,355
but I really was determined to be a theoretical physicist.

417
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:29,014
It's why I went to Princeton in the first place.

418
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,596
It was definitely, and then I realized

419
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:35,510
I was gonna be a mediocre theoretical physicist.

420
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,115
And there were a few people in my classes,

421
00:17:39,115 --> 00:17:42,049
like in quantum mechanics and so on,

422
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:44,493
who they could effortlessly do things

423
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,470
that were so difficult for me.

424
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,575
And I realized like you know, there are a thousand ways

425
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:52,455
to be smart and to be a really, you know,

426
00:17:52,455 --> 00:17:56,013
theoretical physics is not one of those fields

427
00:17:56,013 --> 00:17:58,513
where only the top few percent

428
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:02,372
actually move the state of the art forward.

429
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,011
It's one of those things where you have to be

430
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:09,214
really just, your brain has to be wired in a certain way.

431
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,932
And there was a guy named,

432
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:14,519
one of these people who convinced me.

433
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:16,142
He didn't mean to convince me,

434
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,915
but just by observing him, he convinced me

435
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:20,835
that I should not try to be a theoretical physicist.

436
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:22,519
His name was Yosanta.

437
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,102
And Yosanta was from Sri Lanka.

438
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:30,608
And he was one of the most brilliant people I'd ever met.

439
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:34,936
My friend Joe and I were working on a very difficult

440
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:37,899
partial differential equations problem set one night.

441
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:41,890
And there was one problem that we worked on for three hours,

442
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,723
and we made no headway whatsoever.

443
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:48,333
And we looked up at each other at the same time

444
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,628
and we said, Yosanta.

445
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,875
So we went to Yosanta's dorm room.

446
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,848
And he was there, he was almost always there.

447
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:57,558
And we said Yosanta, we're having trouble solving

448
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:00,655
this partial differential equation,

449
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:02,599
would you mind taking a look?

450
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,528
And he said of course.

451
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:07,716
By the way, he was the most humble, most kind person.

452
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:08,854
And so he took our,

453
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:11,913
he looked at our problem and he stared at it

454
00:19:11,913 --> 00:19:13,730
for just a few seconds, maybe 10 seconds.

455
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,797
And he said cosine.

456
00:19:15,797 --> 00:19:17,892
And I said, what do you mean Yosanta?

457
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:18,888
What do you mean cosine?

458
00:19:18,888 --> 00:19:19,767
He said that's the answer.

459
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,596
And I said no, no, no, come on.

460
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:22,838
And he said let me show you.

461
00:19:22,838 --> 00:19:24,133
And he took out some paper

462
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:27,651
and he wrote down three pages of equations,

463
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:29,428
everything canceled out.

464
00:19:29,428 --> 00:19:30,919
And the answer was cosine.

465
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,714
And I said Yosanta, did you do that in your head?

466
00:19:35,714 --> 00:19:38,152
And he said oh no, that would be impossible.

467
00:19:38,152 --> 00:19:40,954
A few years ago I solved a similar problem

468
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:43,777
and I could map this problem onto that problem.

469
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:45,397
And then it was immediately obvious

470
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:47,434
that the answer was cosine.

471
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:50,389
I had a few, you know, you have an experience like that,

472
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,277
you realize maybe being a theoretical physicist

473
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,555
isn't what your,

474
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:59,351
isn't what the universe wants you to be.

475
00:19:59,351 --> 00:20:04,253
And so I switched to computer science and you know,

476
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:05,755
that worked out really well for me.

477
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:06,588
I enjoy it.

478
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:07,523
I still enjoy it today.

479
00:20:07,523 --> 00:20:09,638
- Yeah, there's a particular kind of intuition you need

480
00:20:09,638 --> 00:20:12,657
to be a great physicist, applied to physics.

481
00:20:12,657 --> 00:20:17,529
- I think the mathematical skill required today is so high.

482
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,929
You have to be a world-class mathematician

483
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,313
to be a successful theoretical physicist today.

484
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:26,871
And it's not you know,

485
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:29,971
you probably need other skills too,

486
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,722
intuition, lateral thinking, and so on.

487
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:35,972
But without just top-notch math skills,

488
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:39,319
you're unlikely to be successful.

489
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:40,847
- And visualization skill,

490
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,589
you have to be able to really kind of do

491
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:45,333
these kinds of thought experiments.

492
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,918
And if you want truly great creativity,

493
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:49,571
actually Walter Isaacson writes about you.

494
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:52,530
It puts you on the same level as Einstein.

495
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,613
- Well, that's very kind.

496
00:20:56,407 --> 00:20:57,587
I'm an inventor.

497
00:20:57,587 --> 00:21:00,833
If you wanna boil down what I am,

498
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,493
I'm really an inventor.

499
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:03,900
And I look at things

500
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,756
and I can come up with atypical solutions and you know,

501
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:11,815
and then I can create a hundred such atypical solutions

502
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:13,458
for something.

503
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:17,375
99 of them may not survive, you know, scrutiny.

504
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:21,957
But one of those 100 is like hmm, maybe there is,

505
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:23,570
maybe that might work.

506
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,417
And then you can keep going from there.

507
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,695
So that kind of lateral thinking,

508
00:21:27,695 --> 00:21:29,811
that kind of inventiveness

509
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:33,811
in a high dimensionality space where the search space

510
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:37,489
is very large, that's where my inventive skills come.

511
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,640
That's the thing is I self-identify

512
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,354
as an inventor more than anything else.

513
00:21:43,354 --> 00:21:45,991
- Yeah, and he describes in all kinds of different ways,

514
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:48,991
Walter Isaacson does that creativity

515
00:21:50,448 --> 00:21:54,436
combined with childlike wander that you've maintained

516
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:57,274
still to this day, all of that combined together.

517
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,297
Is there, like if you were to study

518
00:21:59,297 --> 00:22:02,171
your own brain introspect, how do you think,

519
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,654
what's your thinking process like?

520
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:05,716
We'll talk about the writing process

521
00:22:05,716 --> 00:22:07,514
of putting it down on paper,

522
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:11,264
which is quite rigorous and famous at Amazon.

523
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,829
But how do you, when you sit down, maybe alone,

524
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:17,059
maybe with others,

525
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,573
and thinking through this high dimensional space

526
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:24,053
and looking for creative solutions, creative paths forward,

527
00:22:24,053 --> 00:22:26,314
is there something you could say about that process?

528
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:27,994
- It's such a good question,

529
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:31,091
and I honestly don't know how it works.

530
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:32,931
If I did, I would try to explain it.

531
00:22:32,931 --> 00:22:35,426
I know it involves lots of wandering.

532
00:22:35,426 --> 00:22:36,259
- Yeah.

533
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:40,307
- So I, you know, when I sit down to work on a problem,

534
00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:43,592
I know I don't know where I'm going.

535
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:47,273
So to go in a straight line, to be efficient,

536
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:50,693
efficiency and invention are sort of at odds

537
00:22:50,693 --> 00:22:53,298
because invention, real invention,

538
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:54,633
not incremental improvement.

539
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,584
Incremental improvement is so important

540
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,687
in every endeavor, in everything you do.

541
00:22:58,687 --> 00:23:00,346
You have to work hard on also just making things

542
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,337
a little bit better.

543
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:04,775
But I'm talking about real invention,

544
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:08,693
real lateral thinking, that requires wandering.

545
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:11,294
And you have to give yourself permission to wander.

546
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:13,294
I think a lot of people,

547
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:18,731
they feel like wandering is inefficient.

548
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:24,233
And you know, like when I sit down at a meeting,

549
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:28,598
I don't know how long the meeting is gonna take

550
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,356
if we're trying to solve a problem.

551
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:33,991
Because if I did, then I'd already,

552
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:35,689
I'd know there's some kind of straight line

553
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:38,014
that we're drawing to the solution.

554
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:42,270
The reality is we may have to wander for a long time.

555
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,836
And I do like group invention.

556
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:46,919
I think there's certainly nothing more fun

557
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:49,635
than sitting at a whiteboard with you know,

558
00:23:49,635 --> 00:23:53,673
a group of smart people and spit balling

559
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:57,571
and coming up with new ideas and objections to those ideas,

560
00:23:57,571 --> 00:24:00,015
and then solutions to the objections

561
00:24:00,015 --> 00:24:02,076
and going back and forth.

562
00:24:02,076 --> 00:24:06,217
So like you know, sometimes you wake up with an idea

563
00:24:06,217 --> 00:24:08,531
in the middle of the night

564
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,871
and sometimes you sit down with a group of people

565
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,316
and go back and forth

566
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,754
and both things are really pleasurable.

567
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:16,031
- And when you wander,

568
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:19,864
I think one key thing is to notice a good idea

569
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:25,832
and to maybe, to notice the kernel of a good idea.

570
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,076
Maybe pull at that string.

571
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:31,414
Because I don't think a good idea has come fully formed.

572
00:24:31,414 --> 00:24:33,411
- A hundred percent right.

573
00:24:33,411 --> 00:24:37,515
In fact, when I come up with what I think is a good idea

574
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:40,975
and it survives kind of the first level of scrutiny,

575
00:24:40,975 --> 00:24:42,635
you know, that I do in my own head

576
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:45,855
and I'm ready to tell somebody else about the idea,

577
00:24:45,855 --> 00:24:47,297
I will often say look,

578
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:50,292
it is going to be really easy for you to find objections

579
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:53,154
to this idea, but work with me.

580
00:24:53,154 --> 00:24:54,531
- There's something there.

581
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:55,638
- There's something there.

582
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:57,653
And that is intuition.

583
00:24:57,653 --> 00:24:58,486
- Yeah.

584
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:01,716
- Because it's really easy to kill new ideas

585
00:25:01,716 --> 00:25:02,738
in the beginning.

586
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:04,677
'Cause they do have so many,

587
00:25:04,677 --> 00:25:07,138
so many easy objections to them.

588
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,130
So you need to,

589
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,932
you need to kind of forewarn people

590
00:25:09,932 --> 00:25:12,496
and say look, I know it's gonna take a lot of work

591
00:25:12,496 --> 00:25:14,853
to get this to a fully formed idea.

592
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:16,014
Let's get started on that.

593
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,373
It'll be fun.

594
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:19,808
- So you got that ability to say cosine

595
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:22,053
in you somewhere after all.

596
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,333
Maybe not on math, but-

597
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,179
- In a different domain.

598
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,264
- Yeah.

599
00:25:25,264 --> 00:25:27,600
- There are a thousand ways to be smart, by the way.

600
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,433
- Yeah.

601
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:31,803
- And that is a really, like when I go around, you know,

602
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:33,620
and I meet people, I'm always looking

603
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,704
for the way that they're smart.

604
00:25:35,704 --> 00:25:37,083
And you find it is,

605
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:42,083
that's one of the things that makes the world so interesting

606
00:25:42,182 --> 00:25:43,936
and fun is that it is not,

607
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:47,186
it's not like IQ is a single dimension.

608
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,975
There are people who are smart in such unique ways.

609
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:54,640
- Yeah, you just gave me a good response

610
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,308
to when somebody calls me an idiot on the internet.

611
00:25:57,308 --> 00:26:01,123
You know, that's a thousand ways to be smart, sir.

612
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,947
- Well, they might tell you,

613
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:04,473
yeah, but there are a million to be ways to be dumb.

614
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:06,347
- Yeah, right.

615
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,889
I feel like that's a Mark Twain quote.

616
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:09,722
Okay.

617
00:26:10,563 --> 00:26:12,322
All right, you gave me an amazing tour

618
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,638
of Blue Origin Rocket Factory and Launch Complex

619
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:17,024
in the historic Cape Canaveral.

620
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:18,766
That's where New Glenn,

621
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:22,882
the big rocket we talked about is being built

622
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:24,524
and will launch.

623
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:26,707
Can you explain what the New Glenn Rocket is

624
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:28,635
and tell me some interesting technical aspects

625
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:29,702
of how it works?

626
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,081
- Sure.

627
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:33,248
New Glenn is a very large,

628
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:37,643
a heavy lift launch vehicle.

629
00:26:37,643 --> 00:26:41,440
It'll take about 45 metric tons to LEO,

630
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,357
very, very large class.

631
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:46,664
It's about half the thrust,

632
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:48,145
a little more than half the thrust

633
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:50,576
of the Saturn V Rocket.

634
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:55,360
So it's about 3.9 million pounds of thrust on liftoff.

635
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,277
The booster has seven BE-4 engines.

636
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:02,141
Each engine generates a little more

637
00:27:02,141 --> 00:27:04,641
than 550,000 pounds of thrust.

638
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:09,359
The engines are fueled by liquid natural gas,

639
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,475
liquified natural gas, LNG as the fuel

640
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:15,257
and LOX as the oxidizer.

641
00:27:15,257 --> 00:27:19,283
The cycle is an ox-riched stage combustion cycle.

642
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:21,858
It's a cycle that was really pioneered by the Russians.

643
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:23,642
It's a very good cycle.

644
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:28,142
And that engine is also going to power the first stage

645
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:30,738
of the Vulcan rocket,

646
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:33,302
which is the United Launch Alliance rocket.

647
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:36,452
Then the second stage of New Glenn

648
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:39,307
is powered by two BE-3U engines,

649
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,620
which is a upper stage variant

650
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,424
of our New Shephard liquid hydrogen engine.

651
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:47,826
So the BE-3U has 160,000 pounds of thrust.

652
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:51,920
So two of those 320,000 pounds of thrust

653
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,985
and hydrogen is a very good propellant

654
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:59,122
for upper stages because it has very high ISP.

655
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:03,920
It's not a great propellant in my view for booster stages

656
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,901
because the stages then get physically so large.

657
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:09,151
Hydrogen has very high ISP,

658
00:28:10,163 --> 00:28:12,767
but liquid hydrogen is very,

659
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:14,825
is not dense at all.

660
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,377
So to store liquid hydrogen, you know,

661
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:19,074
if you need to store many thousands

662
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:20,081
of pounds of liquid hydrogen,

663
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:23,099
your tanks, your liquid hydrogen tank, it's very large.

664
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,252
So you really, you get more benefit from the higher ISP,

665
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:29,064
the specific impulse.

666
00:28:29,064 --> 00:28:31,719
You get more benefit from the higher specific impulse

667
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:33,906
on the second stage.

668
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:37,563
And that stage carries less propellant.

669
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:41,040
So you don't get such geometrically gigantic tanks.

670
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,064
The Delta IV is an example of a vehicle

671
00:28:44,064 --> 00:28:45,266
that is all hydrogen.

672
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,582
The booster stage is also hydrogen.

673
00:28:47,582 --> 00:28:49,985
And I think that it's a very effective vehicle,

674
00:28:49,985 --> 00:28:52,801
but it never was very cost effective.

675
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,400
So it's operationally very capable

676
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,899
but not very cost effective.

677
00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:58,559
- So size is also costly.

678
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,761
- Size is costly.

679
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:01,503
So it's interesting.

680
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,578
Rockets love to be big.

681
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,199
Everything works better.

682
00:29:05,199 --> 00:29:06,361
- What do you mean by that?

683
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,478
You've told me that before.

684
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:10,054
It sounds epic, but what does it mean?

685
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:12,239
- I mean, when you look at the,

686
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:15,922
kind of the physics of rocket engines

687
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:19,742
and also when you look at parasitic mass,

688
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:20,862
it doesn't, if you have,

689
00:29:20,862 --> 00:29:22,499
let's say you have an avionic system,

690
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,059
so you have a guidance and control system,

691
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:29,506
that is gonna be about the same mass and size

692
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:33,555
for a giant rocket as it is gonna be for a tiny rocket.

693
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:37,119
And so that's just parasitic mass

694
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,083
that is very consequential if you're building

695
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,206
a very small rocket,

696
00:29:41,206 --> 00:29:44,098
but is trivial if you're building a very large rocket.

697
00:29:44,098 --> 00:29:46,323
So you have the parasitic mass thing.

698
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:48,099
And then if you look at, for example,

699
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:50,559
rocket engines have turbo pumps.

700
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,800
They have to pressurize the fuel and the oxidizer

701
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,779
up to a very high pressure level

702
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:58,101
in order to inject it into the thrust chamber

703
00:29:58,101 --> 00:29:59,927
where it burns.

704
00:29:59,927 --> 00:30:03,523
And those pumps, all rotating machines, in fact

705
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:06,765
get more efficient as they get larger.

706
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:09,668
So really tiny turbo pumps

707
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:13,110
are very challenging to manufacture.

708
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,648
And any kind of gaps, you know,

709
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:19,320
are like between the housing for example,

710
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,729
and the rotating impeller that pressurizes the fuel,

711
00:30:22,729 --> 00:30:24,502
there has to be some gap there.

712
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:27,406
You can't have those parts scraping against one another.

713
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:31,146
And those gaps drive inefficiencies.

714
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:34,972
And so, you know, if you have a very large turbo pump,

715
00:30:34,972 --> 00:30:39,772
those gaps in percentage terms end up being very small.

716
00:30:39,772 --> 00:30:42,247
And so there's a bunch of things

717
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:46,182
that you end up loving about having a large rocket

718
00:30:46,182 --> 00:30:48,525
and that you end up hating for a small rocket.

719
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:51,483
But there's a giant exception to this rule,

720
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:53,298
and it is manufacturing.

721
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:58,227
So manufacturing large structures is very, very challenging.

722
00:30:58,227 --> 00:30:59,509
It's a pain in the butt.

723
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:01,628
And so, you know, it's just if you have,

724
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:03,483
if you're making a small rocket engine,

725
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:04,979
you can move all the pieces by hand,

726
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:08,327
you could assemble it on a table, one person can do it,

727
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:12,659
you know, you don't need cranes and heavy lift operations

728
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,968
and tooling, and so on and so on.

729
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:19,005
When you start building big objects, infrastructure,

730
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:22,424
civil infrastructure, just like the launchpad

731
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:23,623
and the you know, all this,

732
00:31:23,623 --> 00:31:25,371
we went and visited,

733
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:26,468
I took you to the launchpad

734
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,424
and you can see it's so monumental.

735
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:29,428
- Yeah, it is.

736
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:33,100
- And so just these things become major undertakings,

737
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,187
both from an engineering point of view,

738
00:31:35,187 --> 00:31:37,747
but also from a construction and cost point of view.

739
00:31:37,747 --> 00:31:39,987
- And even the foundation of the launchpad,

740
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:42,205
I mean, this is Florida,

741
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:43,209
like isn't like swamp land?

742
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:44,550
Like how deep do you have to go?

743
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,502
- You have to at Cape Canaveral,

744
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,969
in fact, at most ocean, you know, most launch pads

745
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:52,468
are on beaches somewhere in the oceanside.

746
00:31:52,468 --> 00:31:57,245
'cause you wanna launch over water for safety reasons.

747
00:31:57,245 --> 00:32:00,162
The yes, you have to drive pilings,

748
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:04,806
you know, dozens and dozens and dozens of pilings,

749
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:07,944
you know, 50, a 100, 150 feet deep

750
00:32:07,944 --> 00:32:09,481
to get enough structural integrity

751
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:11,408
for these very large, you know, it's yes,

752
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:15,134
these turn into major civil engineering projects.

753
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:17,587
- I just have to say everything about that factory

754
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:18,748
is pretty badass.

755
00:32:18,748 --> 00:32:21,511
You said tooling, the bigger it gets,

756
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:22,521
the more epic it is.

757
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:23,703
- It does make it epic.

758
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:24,536
- Yeah.

759
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:25,369
- It's fun to look at.

760
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:26,353
It's extraordinary.

761
00:32:26,353 --> 00:32:27,577
- It's humbling also,

762
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:29,678
'cause you know, humans are so small compared to it.

763
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:33,428
- We are building these enormous machines

764
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:35,785
that are harnessing enormous amounts

765
00:32:35,785 --> 00:32:40,785
of chemical power, you know, in very, very compact packages.

766
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:44,429
It's truly extraordinary.

767
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,605
- But then there's all the different components

768
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:50,025
and that you know, the materials involved.

769
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:51,546
Is there something interesting

770
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:54,768
that you can describe about the materials

771
00:32:54,768 --> 00:32:57,148
that's comprised the rockets?

772
00:32:57,148 --> 00:33:00,009
So it has to be as light as possible, I guess,

773
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:03,144
whilst withstanding the heat and the harsh conditions?

774
00:33:03,144 --> 00:33:06,528
- Yeah, I play a little kind of game sometimes

775
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:09,530
with other rocket people that I run into where

776
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,824
say what are the things

777
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:13,472
that would amaze the 1960s engineers?

778
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,843
Like what's changed?

779
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:18,441
'Cause surprisingly, some of rocketry greatest hits

780
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,967
have not changed.

781
00:33:19,967 --> 00:33:20,971
They are still,

782
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:24,489
they would recognize immediately a lot of what we do today.

783
00:33:24,489 --> 00:33:27,966
And it's exactly what they pioneered back in the '60s.

784
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:30,533
But a few things have changed.

785
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:33,700
You know, the use of carbon composites

786
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:36,483
is very different today.

787
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:39,898
You know, we can build very sophisticated,

788
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:42,841
you saw our carbon tape laying machine

789
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:44,886
that builds the giant fairings.

790
00:33:44,886 --> 00:33:48,707
And we can build these incredibly light,

791
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:51,124
very stiff fairing structures

792
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:55,488
out of carbon composite material

793
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:57,666
that they could not have dreamed of.

794
00:33:57,666 --> 00:34:00,963
I mean the efficiency, the structural efficiency

795
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:05,304
of that material is so high compared to any you know,

796
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,943
metallic material you might use or anything else.

797
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:09,110
So that's one.

798
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:15,289
Aluminum lithium and the ability

799
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:18,150
to friction stir weld aluminum lithium.

800
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,228
Do you remember the friction stir welding that I showed you?

801
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:21,587
- Yes, incredible.

802
00:34:21,587 --> 00:34:23,344
- This is a remarkable technology.

803
00:34:23,344 --> 00:34:25,442
This was invented decades ago,

804
00:34:25,442 --> 00:34:26,605
but has become very practical

805
00:34:26,605 --> 00:34:29,199
over just the last couple of decades.

806
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,995
And instead of using heat to weld two pieces

807
00:34:32,995 --> 00:34:37,388
of metal together, it literally stirs the two pieces.

808
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:40,824
There's a pin that rotates at a certain rate

809
00:34:40,824 --> 00:34:44,331
and you put that pin between the two plates of metal

810
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,148
that you wanna weld together.

811
00:34:46,148 --> 00:34:50,362
And then you move it at a very precise speed.

812
00:34:50,362 --> 00:34:52,762
And instead of heating the material,

813
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:54,742
it heats it a little bit because of friction,

814
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,054
but not very much.

815
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,806
You can literally immediately after welding

816
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:58,965
with stir friction welding,

817
00:34:58,965 --> 00:35:01,943
you can touch the material and it's just barely warm.

818
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:05,066
It literally stirs the molecules together.

819
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,044
It's quite extraordinary.

820
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:07,850
- Relatively low temperature.

821
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,850
And I guess high temperature is what makes them,

822
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,186
that makes it a weak point?

823
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:12,019
- Exactly.

824
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:16,607
So with traditional welding techniques, you may have

825
00:35:16,607 --> 00:35:19,666
whatever the underlying strength characteristics

826
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,407
of the material are,

827
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:24,263
you end up with weak regions where you weld.

828
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:26,524
And with friction stir welding,

829
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,830
the welds are just as strong as the bulk material.

830
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,549
So it really allows you,

831
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:32,902
and so, 'cause when you're,

832
00:35:32,902 --> 00:35:34,765
you know, let's say you're building a tank

833
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,187
that you're gonna pressurize

834
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:38,436
you know, a large liquid natural gas tank

835
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,288
for our booster stage, for example.

836
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:44,186
You know, if you are welding that with traditional methods,

837
00:35:44,186 --> 00:35:46,288
you have to size those weld lands,

838
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,151
the thickness of those pieces

839
00:35:48,151 --> 00:35:50,578
with that knockdown for whatever damage you're doing

840
00:35:50,578 --> 00:35:51,411
with the weld.

841
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:53,895
And that's gonna add a lot of weight to that tank.

842
00:35:53,895 --> 00:35:56,473
- I mean, even just the looking at the fairings,

843
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:58,085
the result of that,

844
00:35:58,085 --> 00:36:01,671
the complex shape that it takes and-

845
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:02,504
- Yeah.

846
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,184
- And like what it's supposed to do is kind of incredible

847
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:06,947
'cause so people don't know it's on top of the rocket,

848
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,584
it's gonna fall apart.

849
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,749
That's its task.

850
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,986
But it has to stay strong sometimes.

851
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:13,379
- Yes.

852
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,999
- And then disappear when it needs to.

853
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:15,997
- That's right.

854
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:17,352
- Which is a very difficult task.

855
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:18,401
- Yes.

856
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:22,186
When you need something that needs to have 100% integrity

857
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:24,926
until it needs to have 0% integrity.

858
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:27,693
It needs to stay attached until it's ready to go away.

859
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:31,032
And then when it goes away, it has to go away completely.

860
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:33,784
You use explosive charges for that.

861
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:36,198
And so it's a very robust way

862
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:38,115
of separating structure

863
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,390
when you need to.

864
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,475
- Exploding

865
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:42,308
- Yeah.

866
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:45,099
Little tiny bits of explosive material

867
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:48,932
and it just, it'll sever the whole connection.

868
00:36:49,945 --> 00:36:54,688
- So if you wanna go from 100% structural integrity

869
00:36:54,688 --> 00:36:58,065
to zero as fast as possible use explosives,

870
00:36:58,065 --> 00:36:59,831
- Use explosives.

871
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:02,106
- The entirety of this thing is so badass.

872
00:37:02,106 --> 00:37:04,185
Okay, so we're back to the two stages.

873
00:37:04,185 --> 00:37:06,091
So the first stage is reusable.

874
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:06,924
- Yeah.

875
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,009
Second stage is expendable.

876
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:11,929
Second stage is liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen.

877
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,709
So we could take advantage of the higher specific impulse.

878
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:19,459
The the first stage lands downrange on a landing platform

879
00:37:20,302 --> 00:37:23,635
in the ocean, comes back for maintenance

880
00:37:24,572 --> 00:37:26,969
and get ready to do the next mission.

881
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:29,668
- I mean there's a million questions,

882
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:31,303
but also is there a path towards reusability

883
00:37:31,303 --> 00:37:32,754
for the second stage?

884
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:35,645
- There is, and we know how to do that.

885
00:37:35,645 --> 00:37:39,103
Right now we're gonna work on manufacturing

886
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:42,736
that second stage to make it as inexpensive as possible.

887
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:45,633
Sort of two paths for a second stage,

888
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,217
make it reusable,

889
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:50,799
or work really hard to make it inexpensive

890
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:53,778
so you can afford to expend it.

891
00:37:53,778 --> 00:37:58,695
And that trade is actually not obvious which one is better.

892
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,200
- Even in terms of cost.

893
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,239
Even like time cost?

894
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,578
- I'm talking about cost is, you know,

895
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:08,498
space flight, getting into orbit is a solved problem.

896
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:11,801
We solved it back in you know, the '50s and '60s.

897
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:13,299
- You're making it sound easy.

898
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:14,541
- So the only thing that,

899
00:38:14,541 --> 00:38:15,872
the only interesting problem

900
00:38:15,872 --> 00:38:19,917
is dramatically reducing the cost of access to orbit,

901
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:21,618
which is if you can do that,

902
00:38:21,618 --> 00:38:25,535
you open up a bunch of new, you know, endeavors

903
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:29,786
that lots of startup companies, everybody else can do.

904
00:38:29,786 --> 00:38:30,895
So that's, we really,

905
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:32,815
that's one of our missions

906
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:36,175
is to you know, be part of this industry

907
00:38:36,175 --> 00:38:40,078
and lower the cost to orbit so that there can be

908
00:38:40,078 --> 00:38:43,499
you know, a kind of a renaissance, a golden age

909
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:47,335
of people doing all kinds of interesting things in space.

910
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:50,556
- I like how you said getting to orbit is a solved problem.

911
00:38:50,556 --> 00:38:53,539
It is just the only interesting thing is reducing the cost.

912
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,722
You know, how you can describe every single problem

913
00:38:55,722 --> 00:38:57,179
facing human civilization that way.

914
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:00,714
The physicist would say everything is a solved problem.

915
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:01,881
We've solved everything.

916
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,842
The rest is just well, Rutherford said that

917
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,380
"it's just stamp collecting."

918
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,616
It's just the details.

919
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:10,461
It's some of the greatest innovations and inventions

920
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:14,817
and you know, brilliance is in that cost reduction stage.

921
00:39:14,817 --> 00:39:18,071
Right, and you, you've had a long career of cost reduction.

922
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:18,904
- For sure.

923
00:39:18,904 --> 00:39:20,074
And when you,

924
00:39:20,074 --> 00:39:22,734
what does cost reduction really mean?

925
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,997
It means inventing a better way.

926
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:25,995
- Yeah, exactly.

927
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:27,498
- Right, and when you invent a better way,

928
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:29,019
you make the whole world richer.

929
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,378
So, you know, whatever it was,

930
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:32,021
I don't know how many thousands of years ago,

931
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,333
somebody invented the plow.

932
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,962
And when they invented the plow,

933
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:37,437
they made the whole world richer

934
00:39:37,437 --> 00:39:40,258
because they made farming less expensive.

935
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:44,091
And so it is a big deal to invent better ways.

936
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:48,533
That's how the world gets richer.

937
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:52,516
- So what are some of the biggest challenges

938
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,521
on the manufacturing side and the engineering side

939
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:56,703
that you're facing in working

940
00:39:56,703 --> 00:40:00,036
to get to the first launch of New Glenn?

941
00:40:01,376 --> 00:40:03,199
- The first launch is one thing

942
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:07,141
and we'll do that in 2024 coming up in this coming year.

943
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:09,962
The real thing that's the bigger challenge

944
00:40:09,962 --> 00:40:12,873
is making sure that our factory

945
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:15,956
is efficiently manufacturing at rate.

946
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,958
So rate production.

947
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:23,459
So consider if you wanna launch New Glenn

948
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:25,992
you know, 24 times a year.

949
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:29,075
You need to manufacture a upper stage

950
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:34,877
since they're expendable every, you know, twice a month,

951
00:40:34,877 --> 00:40:36,357
you need to do one every two weeks.

952
00:40:36,357 --> 00:40:37,356
So you need to be,

953
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:41,036
you need to have all of your manufacturing facilities

954
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:43,616
and processes and inspection techniques

955
00:40:43,616 --> 00:40:47,822
and acceptance tests and everything operating at rate.

956
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:51,617
And rate manufacturing is at least as difficult

957
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:55,357
as designing the vehicle in the first place.

958
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:56,236
And the same thing.

959
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:59,819
So every upper stage has two BE-3U engines.

960
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:05,453
So those engines you know, you need

961
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:08,859
if you're gonna launch this the vehicle twice a month,

962
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:10,357
you need four engines a month.

963
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:11,675
So you need an engine every week.

964
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:12,998
So you need to be,

965
00:41:12,998 --> 00:41:16,638
that engine needs to be being produced at rate.

966
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:17,656
And that's a,

967
00:41:17,656 --> 00:41:20,719
and there's all of the things that you need to do that,

968
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,138
all the right machine tools, all the right fixtures,

969
00:41:24,138 --> 00:41:26,977
the right people, process, et cetera.

970
00:41:26,977 --> 00:41:30,796
So it's one thing to build a first article, right.

971
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:35,076
So that's you know, to launch New Glenn for the first time,

972
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,492
you need to produce a first article.

973
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:39,899
But that's not the hard part.

974
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:42,551
The hard part is everything that's going on

975
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:45,500
behind the scenes to build a factory

976
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,741
that can produce New Glenn's at rate.

977
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:49,518
- So the first one is produced in a way

978
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:52,199
that enables the production of the second and third

979
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,336
and the fourth and the fifth and sixth, and so on.

980
00:41:54,336 --> 00:41:56,437
- You could think of the first article

981
00:41:56,437 --> 00:41:57,557
as kind of pushing,

982
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:02,557
it pushes all of the rate manufacturing technology along.

983
00:42:02,598 --> 00:42:05,660
You know, in other words, it's kind of the,

984
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,160
it's the test article in a way

985
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:13,224
that's testing out your manufacturing technologies.

986
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:15,672
- The manufacturing is the big challenge.

987
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:16,505
- Yes.

988
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:18,682
I mean I don't want to make it sound like any of it is easy.

989
00:42:18,682 --> 00:42:21,909
I mean the people who are designing the engines

990
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:25,235
and all this, all of it is hard for sure.

991
00:42:25,235 --> 00:42:29,961
But the challenge right now is driving really hard

992
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:32,399
to get to rate manufacturing

993
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:34,059
and to do that in an efficient way.

994
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,812
Again, kind of back to our cost point.

995
00:42:36,812 --> 00:42:39,957
If you get to rate manufacturing in an inefficient way,

996
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,855
you haven't really solved the cost problem

997
00:42:41,855 --> 00:42:43,914
and maybe you haven't really moved

998
00:42:43,914 --> 00:42:45,274
this state of the art forward.

999
00:42:45,274 --> 00:42:46,298
All this has to be

1000
00:42:46,298 --> 00:42:48,177
about moving the state-of-the art forward.

1001
00:42:48,177 --> 00:42:50,040
There are easier businesses to do.

1002
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,239
I always tell people look, if you are trying to make money,

1003
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,596
you know, like start a salty snack food company

1004
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:57,417
or something, you know.

1005
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:00,167
- I'm gonna write that idea down.

1006
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,758
- Like make the Lex Fridman potato chips,

1007
00:43:03,758 --> 00:43:04,762
you know, this is-

1008
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:08,847
- Don't say it, people are gonna steal it.

1009
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:10,067
But yeah, it's hard.

1010
00:43:10,067 --> 00:43:11,457
- You see what I'm saying?

1011
00:43:11,457 --> 00:43:14,121
It's like there's nothing easy about this business

1012
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:16,121
but it's its own reward.

1013
00:43:17,196 --> 00:43:22,176
It's fascinating, it's worthwhile, it's meaningful.

1014
00:43:22,176 --> 00:43:23,274
And so you know, not,

1015
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:25,439
I don't wanna pick on salty snack food companies,

1016
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,757
but I think it's less meaningful.

1017
00:43:26,757 --> 00:43:29,088
You know, at the end of the day,

1018
00:43:29,088 --> 00:43:33,398
you're not gonna have accomplished something amazing.

1019
00:43:33,398 --> 00:43:34,271
- Yeah, there's-

1020
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,778
- Even if you do make a lot of money out of it.

1021
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:37,995
- Yeah, there's something fundamentally different

1022
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:41,454
about the quote unquote business of space exploration.

1023
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:42,459
- Yeah, for sure.

1024
00:43:42,459 --> 00:43:44,231
- It's a grand project of humanity.

1025
00:43:44,231 --> 00:43:45,064
- Yes.

1026
00:43:45,064 --> 00:43:47,637
It's one of humanity's grand challenges.

1027
00:43:47,637 --> 00:43:51,040
And especially as you look at going to the moon

1028
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,418
and going to Mars and building giant O'Neill colonies

1029
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:56,336
and unlocking all the things.

1030
00:43:56,336 --> 00:43:58,522
You know, I won't live long enough

1031
00:43:58,522 --> 00:44:01,274
to see the fruits of this,

1032
00:44:01,274 --> 00:44:06,274
but the fruits of this come from building a road to space,

1033
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,959
getting the infrastructure.

1034
00:44:08,959 --> 00:44:10,440
I'll give you an analogy.

1035
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,618
When I started Amazon,

1036
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:15,583
I didn't have to develop a payment system.

1037
00:44:15,583 --> 00:44:16,575
It already existed.

1038
00:44:16,575 --> 00:44:18,038
It was called the credit card.

1039
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:21,399
I didn't have to develop a transportation system

1040
00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:22,578
to deliver the packages.

1041
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:23,582
It already existed.

1042
00:44:23,582 --> 00:44:25,503
It was called the postal service

1043
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:28,121
and Royal Mail and Deutsche Post.

1044
00:44:28,121 --> 00:44:32,300
And so all this heavy lifting infrastructure

1045
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,960
was already in place.

1046
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,731
And I could stand on its shoulders.

1047
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:40,260
And that's why when you look at the internet,

1048
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,556
you know, by the way, another giant piece of infrastructure

1049
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,555
that was around in the early,

1050
00:44:44,555 --> 00:44:46,819
I'm taking you back to like 1994,

1051
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:49,019
people were using dial up modems.

1052
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,714
And it was piggybacking

1053
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:53,534
on top of the long distance phone network.

1054
00:44:53,534 --> 00:44:55,196
That's how the internet,

1055
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:57,199
that's you know, how people were accessing servers

1056
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,638
and so on.

1057
00:44:58,638 --> 00:45:02,179
And that again, if that hadn't existed,

1058
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,377
it would've been hundreds of billions of CapEx

1059
00:45:05,377 --> 00:45:06,521
to put that out there.

1060
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:09,176
No startup company could have done that.

1061
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:12,509
And so the problem you know, you see in,

1062
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:16,776
if you look at the dynamism in the internet space

1063
00:45:16,776 --> 00:45:18,578
over the last 20 years,

1064
00:45:18,578 --> 00:45:22,520
it's because you know, you see like two kids in a dorm room

1065
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,796
could start an internet company that could be successful

1066
00:45:24,796 --> 00:45:26,415
and do amazing things.

1067
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:28,760
Beause they didn't have to build heavy infrastructure.

1068
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,397
It was already there.

1069
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:33,317
And that's what I wanna do.

1070
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:36,858
I take you know, my Amazon winnings

1071
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:38,942
and use that to build heavy infrastructure

1072
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:41,834
so that the next generation you know,

1073
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:45,276
the generation that's my children and their children,

1074
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:47,882
these, you know, those generations

1075
00:45:47,882 --> 00:45:50,234
can then use that heavy infrastructure.

1076
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:51,899
Then there'll be space entrepreneurs

1077
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:53,356
who start in their dorm room.

1078
00:45:53,356 --> 00:45:54,235
- Yeah.

1079
00:45:54,235 --> 00:45:56,636
- Like that will be a marker of success.

1080
00:45:56,636 --> 00:46:00,177
When you can have a really valuable space company

1081
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:01,831
started in a dorm room,

1082
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:04,223
then we know that we've built enough infrastructure

1083
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:09,018
so that ingenuity and imagination can really be unleashed.

1084
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:10,734
I find that very exciting.

1085
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:13,418
- As they will of course, as kids do,

1086
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:15,978
take all of this hard infrastructurability for granted.

1087
00:46:15,978 --> 00:46:17,477
- Of course.

1088
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:18,310
Which is-

1089
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,479
- That's the entrepreneurial spirit.

1090
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:22,562
- That's an inventors greatest dream.

1091
00:46:23,501 --> 00:46:24,334
- Yeah.

1092
00:46:24,334 --> 00:46:26,717
- Is that their inventions are so successful

1093
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,109
that they are one day taken for granted.

1094
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:31,859
You know, nobody thinks of Amazon as an invention anymore.

1095
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,979
Nobody thinks of customer reviews as,

1096
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:35,419
we pioneered customer reviews,

1097
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:37,312
but now they're so commonplace.

1098
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:39,500
Same thing with one click shopping and so on.

1099
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,655
But that's a compliment.

1100
00:46:40,655 --> 00:46:41,857
That's how you know,

1101
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:45,560
you invent something that's so used,

1102
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,219
so beneficially used by so many people

1103
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:49,879
that they take it for granted.

1104
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:50,895
- I don't know about nobody.

1105
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,097
That's every time I use Amazon,

1106
00:46:52,097 --> 00:46:53,594
I'm still amazed how does this work?

1107
00:46:53,594 --> 00:46:54,724
Logistics.

1108
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:57,777
- Well, that proves you're very curious explorer.

1109
00:46:57,777 --> 00:46:59,997
- All right, all right, back to rockets.

1110
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:00,830
Timeline.

1111
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:03,078
You said 2024.

1112
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,394
As it stands now,

1113
00:47:06,394 --> 00:47:09,029
are both the first test launch and the launch

1114
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:11,659
of escapade explorers to Mars still possible?

1115
00:47:11,659 --> 00:47:13,154
- In 2024? - In 2024.

1116
00:47:13,154 --> 00:47:13,987
Yeah.

1117
00:47:13,987 --> 00:47:14,965
- Yeah, I think so.

1118
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:16,318
For sure the first launch,

1119
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,479
and then we'll see if escapade goes on that or not.

1120
00:47:19,479 --> 00:47:21,157
I think that the first launch for sure.

1121
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:23,265
And I hope escapade too.

1122
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:24,640
- Hope.

1123
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,378
- Well, I just don't know which mission

1124
00:47:26,378 --> 00:47:28,279
it's actually gonna be slated on.

1125
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,195
So we also have other things

1126
00:47:30,195 --> 00:47:31,617
that might go on that first mission.

1127
00:47:31,617 --> 00:47:32,510
- Oh, I got it.

1128
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,181
But you're optimistic that the launches will still-

1129
00:47:35,181 --> 00:47:36,351
- Oh, the first launch,

1130
00:47:36,351 --> 00:47:37,834
I'm very optimistic that the first launch

1131
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,599
of New Glenn will be in 2024.

1132
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,036
And I'm just not a hundred percent certain

1133
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:44,638
what payload will be on that first launch.

1134
00:47:44,638 --> 00:47:46,136
- Are you nervous about it?

1135
00:47:46,136 --> 00:47:47,140
- Are you kidding?

1136
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,723
I'm extremely nervous about it.

1137
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,178
- Oh man.

1138
00:47:52,178 --> 00:47:53,798
- A hundred percent.

1139
00:47:53,798 --> 00:47:56,993
I've, you know, every launch I go to,

1140
00:47:56,993 --> 00:47:59,878
you know, for New Shephard, for other vehicles too,

1141
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:02,041
I'm always nervous for these launches.

1142
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:03,040
But yes, for sure.

1143
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,076
A first launch to have no nervousness about that

1144
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:08,398
would be, you know, some sign of derangement,

1145
00:48:08,398 --> 00:48:09,774
I think so.

1146
00:48:09,774 --> 00:48:11,195
- Well, I got to visit the launchpad,

1147
00:48:11,195 --> 00:48:14,380
it's pretty, I mean, it's epic.

1148
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:17,720
- You know, we have done a tremendous amount

1149
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,495
of ground testing, a tremendous amount of simulation.

1150
00:48:21,495 --> 00:48:24,412
So, you know, a lot of the problems

1151
00:48:25,453 --> 00:48:28,018
that we might find in flight have been resolved,

1152
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:31,095
but there are some problems you can only find in flight.

1153
00:48:31,095 --> 00:48:33,455
So, you know, cross your fingers.

1154
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:36,096
I guarantee you, you'll have fun watching it

1155
00:48:36,096 --> 00:48:37,341
no matter what happens.

1156
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:40,589
- 100% when the thing is fully assembled and comes up.

1157
00:48:40,589 --> 00:48:43,256
- Yeah, the transporter erector.

1158
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:45,515
- The erector, yeah.

1159
00:48:45,515 --> 00:48:48,179
- Just the transporter erector for a rocket of this scale

1160
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:49,659
- Yeah. - is extraordinary.

1161
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:50,820
- That's an incredible machine.

1162
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,477
- The vehicle travels out horizontally

1163
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:55,580
and then kind of-

1164
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,413
- Yeah.

1165
00:48:56,413 --> 00:48:57,458
- You know, comes up.

1166
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:58,326
- Over a few hours?

1167
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,143
- Yeah, it's a beautiful thing to watch.

1168
00:49:00,143 --> 00:49:04,218
- Speaking of which, if that makes you nervous,

1169
00:49:04,218 --> 00:49:06,622
I don't know if you remember,

1170
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:09,455
but you were aboard a New Shephard

1171
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:13,346
on its first crude flight.

1172
00:49:14,499 --> 00:49:16,499
How was that experience?

1173
00:49:17,837 --> 00:49:20,060
Were you terrified then?

1174
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,096
- You know, strangely, I wasn't, you know.

1175
00:49:22,096 --> 00:49:23,619
- When you ride the rocket-

1176
00:49:23,619 --> 00:49:24,570
- It's true.

1177
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,586
- less nerve wracking.

1178
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:26,465
- Its true.

1179
00:49:26,465 --> 00:49:28,039
I've watched other people ride the rocket

1180
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:29,076
and I'm more nervous

1181
00:49:29,076 --> 00:49:31,835
than when I was inside the rocket myself.

1182
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:35,487
It was a difficult conversation to have with my mother

1183
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,676
when I told her I was gonna go on the first one.

1184
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,058
And not only was I gonna go,

1185
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:41,258
but I was gonna bring my brother too.

1186
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:44,274
This is a tough conversation to have with a mom.

1187
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:46,917
- There's a long pause when you told her.

1188
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:49,000
- She's like both of you?

1189
00:49:50,611 --> 00:49:53,528
And it was an incredible experience

1190
00:49:54,397 --> 00:49:57,647
and we were laughing inside the capsule

1191
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:01,438
and you know, we're not nervous.

1192
00:50:01,438 --> 00:50:05,671
The people on the ground were very nervous for us.

1193
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:10,504
It was actually one of the most emotionally powerful parts

1194
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,340
of the experience was not happened even before the flight

1195
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:21,697
at 4:30 in the morning, brother and I are getting ready

1196
00:50:21,697 --> 00:50:23,338
to go to the launch site

1197
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:25,594
and Lauren is gonna take us there in her helicopter

1198
00:50:25,594 --> 00:50:27,213
and we're getting ready to leave.

1199
00:50:27,213 --> 00:50:29,180
And we go outside the ranch house there

1200
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,576
in west Texas where the launch facility is.

1201
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:36,909
And all of our family, my kids and my brother's kids

1202
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,120
and our you know, our parents, and close friends

1203
00:50:44,587 --> 00:50:46,601
are assembled there.

1204
00:50:46,601 --> 00:50:48,383
And they're saying goodbye to us,

1205
00:50:48,383 --> 00:50:50,461
but they're kind of saying,

1206
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:54,114
maybe they think they're saying goodbye to us forever.

1207
00:50:54,114 --> 00:50:56,359
And you know, we might not have felt that way.

1208
00:50:56,359 --> 00:50:57,778
But it was obvious from their faces

1209
00:50:57,778 --> 00:51:00,417
how nervous they were that they felt that way.

1210
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:01,931
And it was sort of powerful

1211
00:51:01,931 --> 00:51:03,900
because it allowed us to see,

1212
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,239
it was almost like attending your own memorial service

1213
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:07,136
or something.

1214
00:51:07,136 --> 00:51:09,856
Like you could feel how loved you were in that moment.

1215
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:12,718
And it was really amazing.

1216
00:51:12,718 --> 00:51:17,385
- Yeah, and I mean there's just a epic nature to it too.

1217
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:21,170
- The accent, the floating and zero gravity.

1218
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,934
I'll tell you something very interesting.

1219
00:51:22,934 --> 00:51:25,184
Zero gravity feels very natural.

1220
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:27,753
I don't know if it's because we are,

1221
00:51:27,753 --> 00:51:30,026
you know, it's like return to the womb or what.

1222
00:51:30,026 --> 00:51:33,491
- You just confirmed you're an alien.

1223
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:35,368
But that's okay.

1224
00:51:35,368 --> 00:51:37,011
I think that's what you just said.

1225
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,602
- It feels so natural to be in zero G.

1226
00:51:38,602 --> 00:51:39,735
It was really interesting.

1227
00:51:39,735 --> 00:51:42,056
And then what people talk about the overview effect

1228
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:44,395
and seeing earth from space,

1229
00:51:44,395 --> 00:51:46,038
I had that feeling very powerfully.

1230
00:51:46,038 --> 00:51:47,788
I think everyone did.

1231
00:51:49,237 --> 00:51:51,698
You see how fragile the earth is.

1232
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:54,554
If you're not an environmentalist, it will make you one.

1233
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:57,776
The the great Jim Lovell quote, you know,

1234
00:51:57,776 --> 00:51:59,822
he looked back at the earth from space

1235
00:51:59,822 --> 00:52:02,542
and he said he realized "you don't go to heaven

1236
00:52:02,542 --> 00:52:03,415
when you die.

1237
00:52:03,415 --> 00:52:05,421
You go to heaven when you're born."

1238
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:08,379
And it's just you know, that's the feeling

1239
00:52:08,379 --> 00:52:09,856
that people get when they're in space.

1240
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:12,236
You see all this blackness, all this nothingness,

1241
00:52:12,236 --> 00:52:15,179
and there's one gem of life, and it's earth.

1242
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:16,642
- It is a gem.

1243
00:52:16,642 --> 00:52:19,536
What, you know, you've talked a lot

1244
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:23,196
about decision making throughout your time with Amazon.

1245
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:27,402
What was that decision like to be the first

1246
00:52:27,402 --> 00:52:29,001
to ride New Shephard?

1247
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:31,178
Like what, just be before you talked to your mom.

1248
00:52:31,178 --> 00:52:32,011
- Yeah.

1249
00:52:32,011 --> 00:52:34,352
- What, like the pros and cons,

1250
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:37,035
like actually as one human being,

1251
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:40,285
as a leader of a company on all fronts,

1252
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:43,254
like what was that decision making like?

1253
00:52:43,254 --> 00:52:45,677
- I decided that, first of all,

1254
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:48,256
I knew the vehicle extremely well.

1255
00:52:48,256 --> 00:52:49,678
I know the team who built it.

1256
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:51,261
I know the vehicle.

1257
00:52:53,161 --> 00:52:57,997
I am very comfortable with like the escape system.

1258
00:52:57,997 --> 00:53:02,997
We put as much effort into the escape system on that vehicle

1259
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:05,835
as we put into all the rest of the vehicle combined.

1260
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:08,193
It's one of the hardest pieces of engineering

1261
00:53:08,193 --> 00:53:10,361
in the entire New Shephard architecture.

1262
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:11,697
- Can you actually describe,

1263
00:53:11,697 --> 00:53:13,401
what do you mean by escape system?

1264
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:14,234
What's involved?

1265
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:16,341
- We have a solid rocket motor

1266
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:18,756
in the base of the crew capsule

1267
00:53:18,756 --> 00:53:22,173
so that if anything goes wrong on ascent,

1268
00:53:23,498 --> 00:53:26,776
you know, while the main rocket engine is firing,

1269
00:53:26,776 --> 00:53:30,314
we can ignite this solid rocket motor

1270
00:53:30,314 --> 00:53:35,314
in the base of the crew capsule and escape from the booster.

1271
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,915
It's a very challenging system to build, design, validate,

1272
00:53:39,915 --> 00:53:42,360
test, all of these things.

1273
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:46,297
It is the reason that I am comfortable letting anyone

1274
00:53:46,297 --> 00:53:47,493
go on New Shephard.

1275
00:53:47,493 --> 00:53:52,243
So the booster is as safe and reliable as we can make it.

1276
00:53:53,315 --> 00:53:55,148
But we are harnessing,

1277
00:53:56,578 --> 00:53:59,077
whenever you're talking about rocket engines,

1278
00:53:59,077 --> 00:54:02,337
I don't care what rocket engine you're talking about,

1279
00:54:02,337 --> 00:54:05,170
you are harnessing such vast power

1280
00:54:06,095 --> 00:54:10,222
in such a small, compact, geometric space.

1281
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:15,222
The power density is so enormous that it is impossible

1282
00:54:15,459 --> 00:54:18,956
to ever be sure that nothing will go wrong.

1283
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:22,039
And so the only way to improve safety

1284
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,780
is to have an escape system.

1285
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,256
And you know, and historically rockets,

1286
00:54:27,256 --> 00:54:29,501
human rated rockets have had escape systems.

1287
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:32,682
Only the space shuttle did not.

1288
00:54:32,682 --> 00:54:35,161
And, but Apollo had one,

1289
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:39,758
you know, all of the previous, you know, Gemini, et cetera,

1290
00:54:39,758 --> 00:54:42,154
they all had escape systems.

1291
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,999
And we have on New shephard of unusual escapes,

1292
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:48,457
most escape systems are towers.

1293
00:54:48,457 --> 00:54:50,097
We have a pusher escape system.

1294
00:54:50,097 --> 00:54:52,598
So the solid rocket motor is actually embedded

1295
00:54:52,598 --> 00:54:53,912
in the base of the crew capsule.

1296
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:55,902
And it pushes and it's reusable

1297
00:54:55,902 --> 00:54:58,862
in the sense that if we don't use it,

1298
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:02,096
so if we have a nominal mission, we land with it.

1299
00:55:02,096 --> 00:55:04,598
The tower systems have to be ejected

1300
00:55:04,598 --> 00:55:06,421
at a certain point in the mission,

1301
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:09,358
and so they get wasted even in a nominal mission.

1302
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:12,318
And so again, you know, cost really matters on these things.

1303
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:14,252
So we figured out how to have the escape system

1304
00:55:14,252 --> 00:55:15,502
be a reusable ,

1305
00:55:16,577 --> 00:55:19,176
in the event that it's not used, you can reuse it

1306
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:21,355
and have it be a pusher system.

1307
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:23,058
It's a very sophisticated thing.

1308
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:24,416
So I knew these things.

1309
00:55:24,416 --> 00:55:26,779
You asked me about my decision to go

1310
00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:28,700
and so I know the vehicle very well.

1311
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,434
I know the people who designed it.

1312
00:55:31,434 --> 00:55:33,100
I had great trust in them

1313
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,834
and in the engineering that we did.

1314
00:55:35,834 --> 00:55:40,834
And I thought to myself look, if I am not ready to go,

1315
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:43,596
then I wouldn't want anyone to go.

1316
00:55:43,596 --> 00:55:47,317
A tourism vehicle has to be designed in my view,

1317
00:55:47,317 --> 00:55:50,231
to have very, to be as safe as one can make it.

1318
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:52,794
You can't make it perfectly safe.

1319
00:55:52,794 --> 00:55:54,556
It's impossible.

1320
00:55:54,556 --> 00:55:56,959
But you know, you just have to,

1321
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:58,080
people will do things.

1322
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,849
People take risks, you know, they climb mountains,

1323
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:05,055
they skydive, they do deep underwater scuba diving,

1324
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:05,888
and so on.

1325
00:56:05,888 --> 00:56:08,177
People are okay taking risk.

1326
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:10,198
You can't eliminate the risk.

1327
00:56:10,198 --> 00:56:13,660
But it is something, because it's a tourism vehicle,

1328
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,954
you have to do your utmost to eliminate those risks.

1329
00:56:16,954 --> 00:56:19,102
And I felt very good about the system.

1330
00:56:19,102 --> 00:56:22,340
I think it's one of the reasons I was so calm

1331
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,796
inside and maybe others weren't just calm,

1332
00:56:24,796 --> 00:56:26,497
they didn't know as much about it as I did.

1333
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:28,241
- Who was in charge of engaging the escape system?

1334
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,307
Did you have-

1335
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:30,140
- It's automated.

1336
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:30,973
- Okay.

1337
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:31,903
- The escape system is-

1338
00:56:31,903 --> 00:56:33,205
- I was visualizing deployment of that.

1339
00:56:33,205 --> 00:56:34,209
- is completely automated.

1340
00:56:34,209 --> 00:56:38,569
Automated is better because it can react so much faster.

1341
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:40,647
- So yeah, for tourism rockets

1342
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,729
safety is a huge, huge, huge priority for space exploration

1343
00:56:43,729 --> 00:56:46,725
also, but a tiny, you know, a delta less.

1344
00:56:46,725 --> 00:56:47,558
- Yes.

1345
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:49,308
I mean I think for you know, if you're doing,

1346
00:56:49,308 --> 00:56:51,409
you know, there are human activities

1347
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,586
where we tolerate more risk.

1348
00:56:52,586 --> 00:56:54,370
If you're saving somebody's life, you know,

1349
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,703
if you are engaging in real exploration,

1350
00:56:59,505 --> 00:57:02,566
these are things where, you know,

1351
00:57:02,566 --> 00:57:06,233
I personally think we would accept more risk

1352
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:09,747
in part because you have to.

1353
00:57:09,747 --> 00:57:12,902
- Is there a part of you that's frustrated

1354
00:57:12,902 --> 00:57:16,083
by the rate of progress in Blue Origin?

1355
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,144
- Blue Origin needs to be much faster.

1356
00:57:18,144 --> 00:57:21,903
And it's one of the reasons that I left my role

1357
00:57:21,903 --> 00:57:25,664
as the CEO of Amazon a couple of years ago.

1358
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:27,568
I needed, I wanted to come in

1359
00:57:27,568 --> 00:57:30,072
and Blue Origin needs me right now.

1360
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:33,124
And so I had always, when I was the CEO of Amazon,

1361
00:57:33,124 --> 00:57:35,864
my point of view on this is if I'm the CEO

1362
00:57:35,864 --> 00:57:38,064
of a publicly traded company

1363
00:57:38,064 --> 00:57:39,846
it's going to get my full attention.

1364
00:57:39,846 --> 00:57:44,484
And I really, it's just how I think about things.

1365
00:57:44,484 --> 00:57:46,106
It was very important to me.

1366
00:57:46,106 --> 00:57:49,685
I felt I had an obligation to all the stakeholders

1367
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:51,435
at Amazon to do that.

1368
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,363
And so having, you know, turned the CEO,

1369
00:57:55,363 --> 00:57:57,145
I'm still the executive chair there,

1370
00:57:57,145 --> 00:57:59,400
but I've turned the CEO role over.

1371
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,814
And the reason, the primary reason I did that

1372
00:58:02,814 --> 00:58:06,012
is so that I could spend time on Blue Origin

1373
00:58:06,012 --> 00:58:09,693
adding some you know, energy, some sense of urgency.

1374
00:58:09,693 --> 00:58:13,151
We need to move much faster and we're going to.

1375
00:58:13,151 --> 00:58:15,148
- What are the ways to speed it up?

1376
00:58:15,148 --> 00:58:16,731
So, I mean there's,

1377
00:58:18,484 --> 00:58:23,484
you've talked a lot of different ways to sort of at Amazon,

1378
00:58:23,946 --> 00:58:28,696
you know, removing barriers for progress or distributing,

1379
00:58:30,322 --> 00:58:33,026
making everybody autonomous and self reliant

1380
00:58:33,026 --> 00:58:34,645
in terms of all those kinds of things.

1381
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:37,286
Is that apply at Blue Origin

1382
00:58:37,286 --> 00:58:38,119
or is the-

1383
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:38,952
- It does apply.

1384
00:58:38,952 --> 00:58:41,507
You know, I'm leading this directly.

1385
00:58:41,507 --> 00:58:45,187
We are gonna become the world's most decisive company

1386
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:47,183
across any industry.

1387
00:58:47,183 --> 00:58:51,516
And so you know, at Amazon ever since the beginning,

1388
00:58:53,726 --> 00:58:54,776
I said we are gonna become

1389
00:58:54,776 --> 00:58:59,102
the world's most customer obsessed company.

1390
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:01,603
And no matter the industry, like people,

1391
00:59:01,603 --> 00:59:03,900
one day people are going to come to Amazon

1392
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,346
from the healthcare industry and wanna know

1393
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:07,345
how did you guys,

1394
00:59:07,345 --> 00:59:08,446
how are you so customer obsessed?

1395
00:59:08,446 --> 00:59:10,823
How do you actually not just pay lip service,

1396
00:59:10,823 --> 00:59:13,061
but actually do that?

1397
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:14,360
And from you know,

1398
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,226
all different industries should come on and study us

1399
00:59:16,226 --> 00:59:19,007
to see how we accomplish that.

1400
00:59:19,007 --> 00:59:21,869
And the analogous thing at Blue Origin

1401
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:24,289
and it will help us move faster

1402
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:28,864
is we are gonna become the world's most decisive company.

1403
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:30,303
We're gonna get really good

1404
00:59:30,303 --> 00:59:32,863
at taking appropriate technology risk

1405
00:59:32,863 --> 00:59:34,944
and making those decisions quickly.

1406
00:59:34,944 --> 00:59:37,310
You know, being bold on those things.

1407
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:39,609
That's what, and having the right culture

1408
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:40,863
that supports that.

1409
00:59:40,863 --> 00:59:44,686
You need people to be ambitious, technically ambitious.

1410
00:59:44,686 --> 00:59:47,585
You know, if there are five ways to do something,

1411
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:48,728
we'll study them.

1412
00:59:48,728 --> 00:59:51,045
But let's study them very quickly and make a decision.

1413
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,088
We can always change our mind.

1414
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:55,845
It doesn't you know, changing your mind is,

1415
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:59,898
I took about one-way doors and two-way doors.

1416
00:59:59,898 --> 01:00:02,648
Most decisions are two-way doors.

1417
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:04,785
- Can ou explain that?

1418
01:00:04,785 --> 01:00:06,805
'Cause I love that metaphor.

1419
01:00:06,805 --> 01:00:10,026
- If you make the wrong decision,

1420
01:00:10,026 --> 01:00:12,825
if it's a two-way door decision, you walk out the door,

1421
01:00:12,825 --> 01:00:14,909
you pick a door, you walk out,

1422
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:16,546
and you spend a little time there.

1423
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:17,823
It turns out to be the wrong decision,

1424
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,308
you can come back in and pick another door.

1425
01:00:20,308 --> 01:00:23,849
Some decisions are so consequential

1426
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:27,006
and so important and so hard to reverse

1427
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:29,090
that they really are one-way door decisions.

1428
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:32,585
You go in that door, you're not coming back.

1429
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:35,168
And those decisions have to be made

1430
01:00:35,168 --> 01:00:38,109
very deliberately, very carefully.

1431
01:00:38,109 --> 01:00:41,687
If you can think of yet another way to analyze the decision,

1432
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:43,363
you should slow down and do that.

1433
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:46,946
So, you know, when I was the CEO of Amazon,

1434
01:00:48,009 --> 01:00:49,588
I often found myself in the position

1435
01:00:49,588 --> 01:00:52,212
of being the chief slowdown officer

1436
01:00:52,212 --> 01:00:54,781
because somebody would be bringing me

1437
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:56,364
a one-way door decision.

1438
01:00:56,364 --> 01:00:58,704
And I would say okay, I can think of three more ways

1439
01:00:58,704 --> 01:00:59,593
to analyze that.

1440
01:00:59,593 --> 01:01:00,960
So let's go do that.

1441
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,820
Because we ha we are not gonna be able

1442
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,859
to reverse this one easily.

1443
01:01:03,859 --> 01:01:06,463
Maybe you can reverse it, but it's gonna be very costly

1444
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:07,787
and very time consuming.

1445
01:01:07,787 --> 01:01:10,632
We really have to get this one right from the beginning.

1446
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:14,382
And what happens, unfortunately in companies,

1447
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:21,686
what can happen is that you have a one size fits all

1448
01:01:21,686 --> 01:01:24,043
decision making process

1449
01:01:24,043 --> 01:01:27,907
where you end up using the heavyweight process

1450
01:01:27,907 --> 01:01:29,068
on all decisions.

1451
01:01:29,068 --> 01:01:29,941
- For everything, yeah.

1452
01:01:29,941 --> 01:01:31,407
- Including the lightweight ones.

1453
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:33,344
The two-way door decisions.

1454
01:01:33,344 --> 01:01:35,285
Two-way door decisions should mostly be made

1455
01:01:35,285 --> 01:01:38,683
by single individuals or by very small teams

1456
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:41,225
deep in the organization.

1457
01:01:41,225 --> 01:01:43,969
And one-way door decisions are the ones

1458
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:45,426
the irreversible ones,

1459
01:01:45,426 --> 01:01:47,802
those are the ones that should be elevated up

1460
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:50,923
to you know, the senior most executives

1461
01:01:50,923 --> 01:01:53,089
who should slow them down and make sure

1462
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:55,149
that the right thing is being done.

1463
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:57,146
- Yeah, I mean, part of the skill here

1464
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,041
is to know the difference in one-way and two-way,

1465
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:00,728
I think you mentioned.

1466
01:02:00,728 --> 01:02:01,561
- Yes.

1467
01:02:01,561 --> 01:02:03,729
- I mean I think you mentioned Amazon Prime,

1468
01:02:03,729 --> 01:02:06,522
the decision to sort of create Amazon Prime

1469
01:02:06,522 --> 01:02:08,146
as a one-way door.

1470
01:02:08,146 --> 01:02:10,527
I mean, it's not, it's unclear if it is or not,

1471
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:14,648
but it probably is, and it's a really big risk to go there.

1472
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,901
- There are a bunch of decisions like that that are

1473
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:19,484
you know, changing the decision

1474
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:22,508
is gonna be very, very complicated.

1475
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:24,447
Some of them are technical decisions too,

1476
01:02:24,447 --> 01:02:26,131
because some technical decisions

1477
01:02:26,131 --> 01:02:28,029
are like quick drying cement.

1478
01:02:28,029 --> 01:02:29,830
You know, if you're gonna, once you make 'em,

1479
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:30,850
it gets really hard.

1480
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:32,570
I mean, you know, choosing which propellants

1481
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:34,059
to use in a vehicle.

1482
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:36,869
You know, selecting LNG for the booster stage

1483
01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:40,063
and selecting hydrogen for the upper stage,

1484
01:02:40,063 --> 01:02:43,469
that has turned out to be a very good decision.

1485
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:47,719
But if you changed your mind, that would be a very,

1486
01:02:48,572 --> 01:02:50,592
that would be a very big setback.

1487
01:02:50,592 --> 01:02:52,130
Do you see what I'm saying?

1488
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,129
- Yeah.

1489
01:02:53,129 --> 01:02:54,533
- So that's the kind of decision

1490
01:02:54,533 --> 01:02:57,587
you scrutinize very, very carefully.

1491
01:02:57,587 --> 01:02:58,828
Other things just aren't like that.

1492
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:01,586
Most decisions are not that way.

1493
01:03:01,586 --> 01:03:04,250
Most decisions should be made by single individuals,

1494
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:05,438
but they need,

1495
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:08,349
and done quickly in the full understanding

1496
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:10,694
that you can always change your mind.

1497
01:03:10,694 --> 01:03:12,970
- Yeah, one of the things I really liked,

1498
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:14,572
perhaps it's not a two-way door decision

1499
01:03:14,572 --> 01:03:17,239
is I disagree and commit phrase.

1500
01:03:19,008 --> 01:03:19,841
So don't,

1501
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:23,783
so somebody brings up an idea to you.

1502
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:25,729
If it's a two-way door,

1503
01:03:25,729 --> 01:03:29,474
you state that you don't understand enough to agree,

1504
01:03:29,474 --> 01:03:32,286
but you still back them.

1505
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:33,325
I'd love for you to explain it.

1506
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:36,704
- Yeah, disagree and commit is a really important principle

1507
01:03:36,704 --> 01:03:38,593
that saves a lot of arguing.

1508
01:03:38,593 --> 01:03:39,426
- Yeah.

1509
01:03:39,426 --> 01:03:40,259
- So-

1510
01:03:40,259 --> 01:03:41,725
- I'm gonna use that in my personal life.

1511
01:03:41,725 --> 01:03:44,143
I disagree, but commit.

1512
01:03:44,143 --> 01:03:47,362
- It's very common in any endeavor in life,

1513
01:03:47,362 --> 01:03:49,234
in business, and any you know,

1514
01:03:49,234 --> 01:03:51,329
anybody where you have teammates.

1515
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:54,853
You have a teammate and the two of you disagree.

1516
01:03:54,853 --> 01:03:57,430
At some point you have to make a decision.

1517
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:59,091
And you know, in companies

1518
01:03:59,091 --> 01:04:00,926
we tend to organize hierarchically.

1519
01:04:00,926 --> 01:04:04,054
So there's this you know, whoever's the more senior person

1520
01:04:04,054 --> 01:04:06,295
ultimately gets to make the decision.

1521
01:04:06,295 --> 01:04:09,425
So ultimately the CEO gets to make that decision.

1522
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:11,891
And the CEO may not always make the decision

1523
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:12,889
that they agree with.

1524
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:15,567
So like you know, I would often

1525
01:04:15,567 --> 01:04:17,974
I would be the one who would disagree and commit.

1526
01:04:17,974 --> 01:04:22,148
One of my direct reports would very much wanna do it,

1527
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:24,453
do something in a particular way.

1528
01:04:24,453 --> 01:04:26,374
I would think it was a bad idea.

1529
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:28,945
I would explain my point of view.

1530
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:33,220
They would say Jeff, I think you're wrong, and here's why.

1531
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:34,983
And we would go back and forth

1532
01:04:34,983 --> 01:04:38,112
and I would often say you know what?

1533
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:40,167
I don't think you're right,

1534
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,584
but I'm gonna gamble with you

1535
01:04:43,452 --> 01:04:48,050
and you're closer to the ground truth than I am.

1536
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:52,111
I had known you for 20 years, you have great judgment.

1537
01:04:52,111 --> 01:04:53,826
I don't know that I'm right either.

1538
01:04:53,826 --> 01:04:55,148
Not really, not for sure.

1539
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:57,709
All these decisions are complicated.

1540
01:04:57,709 --> 01:04:59,004
Let's do it your way.

1541
01:04:59,004 --> 01:05:01,416
But at least then you've made a decision.

1542
01:05:01,416 --> 01:05:05,347
And I'm agreeing to commit to that decision.

1543
01:05:05,347 --> 01:05:06,771
So I'm not gonna be second guessing it.

1544
01:05:06,771 --> 01:05:08,054
I'm not gonna be sniping at it.

1545
01:05:08,054 --> 01:05:10,649
I'm not gonna be saying I told you so.

1546
01:05:10,649 --> 01:05:14,788
I'm gonna try actively to help make sure it works.

1547
01:05:14,788 --> 01:05:18,209
That's a really important teammate behavior.

1548
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:21,829
There's so many ways that dispute resolution

1549
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:25,248
is a really interesting thing on teams.

1550
01:05:25,248 --> 01:05:28,511
And there are so many ways when two people disagree

1551
01:05:28,511 --> 01:05:30,212
about something, even, I'm assuming in the case

1552
01:05:30,212 --> 01:05:32,268
where everybody's well intentioned,

1553
01:05:32,268 --> 01:05:33,828
they just have a very different opinion

1554
01:05:33,828 --> 01:05:36,307
about what the right decision is.

1555
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:40,158
And we have, in our society and inside companies,

1556
01:05:40,158 --> 01:05:42,666
we have a bunch of mechanisms

1557
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,768
that we use to resolve these kinds of disputes.

1558
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:50,420
A lot of 'em are, I think really bad.

1559
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,652
So, you know, an example of a really bad way

1560
01:05:53,652 --> 01:05:57,234
of coming to agreement is compromise.

1561
01:05:57,234 --> 01:05:58,885
So compromise, you know, look,

1562
01:05:58,885 --> 01:06:01,350
we're in a room here and I could say

1563
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:04,525
Lex, how tall do you think this ceiling is?

1564
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:07,369
And you'd be like I don't know, Jeff, maybe 12 feet tall.

1565
01:06:07,369 --> 01:06:11,392
And I would say I think it's 11 feet tall.

1566
01:06:11,392 --> 01:06:12,225
- Yeah.

1567
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:13,609
- And then we'd say you know what?

1568
01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:16,071
Let's just call it 11 and a half feet.

1569
01:06:16,071 --> 01:06:17,877
That's compromise.

1570
01:06:17,877 --> 01:06:18,710
- Yeah.

1571
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:21,484
- Instead of the right thing to do is you know,

1572
01:06:21,484 --> 01:06:23,815
to get a tape measure or figure out some way

1573
01:06:23,815 --> 01:06:26,065
of actually measuring,

1574
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:27,364
but think getting that tape measure

1575
01:06:27,364 --> 01:06:29,608
and figure out how to get it to the top of the ceiling

1576
01:06:29,608 --> 01:06:31,448
and all these things that requires energy.

1577
01:06:31,448 --> 01:06:34,647
Compromise, the advantage of compromise

1578
01:06:34,647 --> 01:06:38,972
as a resolution mechanism is that it's low energy,

1579
01:06:38,972 --> 01:06:41,392
but it doesn't lead to truth.

1580
01:06:41,392 --> 01:06:44,626
And so in things like the height of the ceiling,

1581
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:46,745
where truth is a noble thing,

1582
01:06:46,745 --> 01:06:48,829
you shouldn't allow compromise to be used

1583
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:51,052
when you can know the truth.

1584
01:06:51,052 --> 01:06:54,157
Another really bad resolution mechanism

1585
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:58,024
that happens all the time is just who's more stubborn.

1586
01:06:58,024 --> 01:06:58,894
- Yeah.

1587
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:03,550
- This is also, let's say two executives who disagree

1588
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,791
and they just have a war of attrition.

1589
01:07:05,791 --> 01:07:09,494
And whichever one gets exhausted first

1590
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:11,131
capitulates to the other one.

1591
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:13,233
Again, you haven't arrived at truth.

1592
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:15,973
And this is very demoralizing.

1593
01:07:15,973 --> 01:07:18,707
So, you know, this is where escalation,

1594
01:07:18,707 --> 01:07:22,374
I try to ask people who you know, on my team

1595
01:07:23,287 --> 01:07:25,771
and say never get to a point

1596
01:07:25,771 --> 01:07:28,430
where you are resolving something by you know,

1597
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:31,228
who gets exhausted first.

1598
01:07:31,228 --> 01:07:32,708
Escalate that.

1599
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,328
I'll help you make the decision.

1600
01:07:34,328 --> 01:07:36,828
Because that's so de-energized

1601
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:40,828
and such a terrible, lousy way to make a decision.

1602
01:07:40,828 --> 01:07:42,211
- So you want to get to the resolution

1603
01:07:42,211 --> 01:07:43,233
as quickly as possible

1604
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:45,505
because that ultimately leads to high velocity of decision.

1605
01:07:45,505 --> 01:07:46,338
- Yes.

1606
01:07:46,338 --> 01:07:48,865
And you wanna try to get as close to truth as possible.

1607
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:52,786
So you want like you know, exhausting the other person

1608
01:07:52,786 --> 01:07:54,486
is not truth seeking.

1609
01:07:54,486 --> 01:07:55,319
- Yes.

1610
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:57,890
- And compromise is not truth seeking.

1611
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,551
So, you know, it doesn't mean,

1612
01:07:59,551 --> 01:08:01,187
now, and there are a lot of cases

1613
01:08:01,187 --> 01:08:02,546
where no one knows the real truth

1614
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,667
and that's where disagreeing commit can come in.

1615
01:08:04,667 --> 01:08:09,667
But it's escalation is better than more of attrition.

1616
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:13,291
Escalate to you know, to your boss

1617
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,786
and say hey, we can't agree on this.

1618
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:16,670
We like each other, we're respectful of each other,

1619
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,934
but we strongly disagree with each other.

1620
01:08:18,934 --> 01:08:20,984
We need you to you know, make a decision here

1621
01:08:20,984 --> 01:08:22,810
so we can move forward.

1622
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:27,810
But decisiveness, moving forward quickly on decisions

1623
01:08:27,919 --> 01:08:30,849
as quickly as you responsibly can

1624
01:08:30,849 --> 01:08:32,535
is how you increase velocity.

1625
01:08:32,535 --> 01:08:35,527
Most of what slows things down is taking too long

1626
01:08:35,527 --> 01:08:38,890
to make decisions at all scale levels.

1627
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:41,608
You know, so it has to be part of the culture

1628
01:08:41,608 --> 01:08:43,094
to get high velocity.

1629
01:08:43,094 --> 01:08:45,712
You know, Amazon has a million and a half people

1630
01:08:45,712 --> 01:08:48,028
and the company is still fast.

1631
01:08:48,028 --> 01:08:50,611
We're still decisive, we're still quick.

1632
01:08:50,611 --> 01:08:53,286
And that's because the culture supports that.

1633
01:08:53,286 --> 01:08:55,582
- At every scale in a distributed way.

1634
01:08:55,582 --> 01:08:56,415
- Yes.

1635
01:08:56,415 --> 01:08:58,111
- Try to maximize the velocity of decisions.

1636
01:08:58,111 --> 01:08:58,944
- Exactly.

1637
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:01,792
- You've mentioned the lunar program.

1638
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:03,109
Let me ask you about that.

1639
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,379
- Yeah.

1640
01:09:04,379 --> 01:09:06,264
- There's a lot going on there

1641
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:08,307
and you haven't really talked about it much.

1642
01:09:08,307 --> 01:09:11,393
So in addition to the Artemis program with NASA,

1643
01:09:11,393 --> 01:09:13,584
Blue is doing its own lander program.

1644
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:15,229
Can you describe it?

1645
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:19,149
There's a sexy picture on Instagram with one of them.

1646
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:20,680
Is it the MK1, I guess?

1647
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,514
- Yeah,

1648
01:09:21,514 --> 01:09:22,346
The MK1.

1649
01:09:22,346 --> 01:09:26,474
The picture is me with Bill Nelson, the NASA administrator.

1650
01:09:26,474 --> 01:09:29,069
- Just to clarify, the Lander is the sexy thing

1651
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:30,573
about the Instagram.

1652
01:09:30,573 --> 01:09:31,478
Really wanna clarify that.

1653
01:09:31,478 --> 01:09:32,310
- I know it's not me.

1654
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:34,290
I know it was either the lander or Bill.

1655
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,122
- Okay.

1656
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:37,456
I love Bill, but-

1657
01:09:37,456 --> 01:09:38,680
- Thank you for clarifying.

1658
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,779
- Okay.

1659
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:44,446
- Yes, the MK1 Lander is designed to take 3000 kilograms

1660
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:50,872
to the surface of the moon in a cargo, expendable cargo.

1661
01:09:50,872 --> 01:09:52,211
It's an expendable lander.

1662
01:09:52,211 --> 01:09:54,095
Lands on the moon, stays there,

1663
01:09:54,095 --> 01:09:56,137
take 3000 kilograms to the surface.

1664
01:09:56,137 --> 01:09:59,893
It can be launched on a single New Glenn flight,

1665
01:09:59,893 --> 01:10:01,356
which is very important.

1666
01:10:01,356 --> 01:10:04,130
So it's a relatively simple architecture,

1667
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:06,932
just like the human landing system lander

1668
01:10:06,932 --> 01:10:08,935
that they called the MK2.

1669
01:10:08,935 --> 01:10:12,268
MK1 is also fueled with liquid hydrogen,

1670
01:10:14,275 --> 01:10:17,525
and which is for high energy emissions,

1671
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,777
like landing on the surface of the moon,

1672
01:10:20,777 --> 01:10:22,971
the high specific impulse of hydrogen

1673
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:24,710
is a very big advantage.

1674
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:28,033
The disadvantage of hydrogen has always been

1675
01:10:28,033 --> 01:10:31,394
that it's, since it's such a deep cryogen,

1676
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:33,153
it's not storable.

1677
01:10:33,153 --> 01:10:35,089
So it's constantly boiling off

1678
01:10:35,089 --> 01:10:39,168
and you're losing propellant because it's boiling off.

1679
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:43,590
And so we're doing, as part of our lunar program,

1680
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:46,714
it's developing solar powered cryo coolers

1681
01:10:46,714 --> 01:10:50,516
that can actually make hydrogen a storable propellant

1682
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:52,274
for deep space.

1683
01:10:52,274 --> 01:10:53,749
And that's a real game changer.

1684
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,306
It's a game changer for any high energy mission.

1685
01:10:56,306 --> 01:10:58,892
So to the moon, but to the outer planets,

1686
01:10:58,892 --> 01:11:00,457
to Mars, everywhere.

1687
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:03,386
- So the idea with MK1, both MK1 and MK2

1688
01:11:03,386 --> 01:11:07,969
is the New Glenn can carry it from the surface of earth

1689
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:12,671
to the surface of the moon.

1690
01:11:12,671 --> 01:11:13,875
- Exactly.

1691
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:16,499
So the Mk1 is expendable.

1692
01:11:16,499 --> 01:11:20,402
The lunar lander we're developing for NASA,

1693
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:24,916
the Mk2 lander, that's part of the Artemis program.

1694
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:27,670
They call it the sustaining lander program.

1695
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:31,713
So that lander is designed to be reusable.

1696
01:11:31,713 --> 01:11:34,193
It can land on the surface of the moon

1697
01:11:34,193 --> 01:11:36,671
in a single stage configuration and then take off.

1698
01:11:36,671 --> 01:11:38,436
So the whole you know,

1699
01:11:38,436 --> 01:11:41,690
if you look at the Apollo program,

1700
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:44,824
the lunar lander and Apollo was really two stages.

1701
01:11:44,824 --> 01:11:47,095
It would land on the surface

1702
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:49,564
and then it would leave the descent stage

1703
01:11:49,564 --> 01:11:50,850
on the surface of the moon,

1704
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:53,012
and only the absent stage would go back up

1705
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:55,352
into lunar orbit where it would rendezvous

1706
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:56,979
with the command module.

1707
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,733
Here what we're doing is we have a single stage lunar lander

1708
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,571
that carries down enough propellant

1709
01:12:02,571 --> 01:12:04,466
so that it can bring the whole thing back up

1710
01:12:04,466 --> 01:12:07,415
so that it can be reused over and over.

1711
01:12:07,415 --> 01:12:08,935
And the point of doing that, of course,

1712
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:12,964
is to reduce cost so that you can make lunar missions

1713
01:12:12,964 --> 01:12:14,791
more affordable over time,

1714
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:17,711
which is, that's one of NASA's big objectives

1715
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:21,552
because this time the whole point of Artemis

1716
01:12:21,552 --> 01:12:25,530
is go back to the moon, but this time to stay.

1717
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:28,730
So, you know, back in the Apollo program,

1718
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:31,871
we went to the moon six times and then ended the program

1719
01:12:31,871 --> 01:12:36,196
and it really was too expensive to continue.

1720
01:12:36,196 --> 01:12:38,953
- And so there's a few questions there,

1721
01:12:38,953 --> 01:12:40,689
but one is how do you stay on the moon?

1722
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,533
What ideas do you have about-

1723
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:44,366
- Yeah.

1724
01:12:44,366 --> 01:12:49,366
- Like sustaining life where a few folks can stay there

1725
01:12:49,575 --> 01:12:51,823
for prolonged periods of time?

1726
01:12:51,823 --> 01:12:55,271
- Well, one of the things we're working on

1727
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:58,938
is using lunar resources like lunar regolith

1728
01:13:00,389 --> 01:13:05,072
to manufacture commodities and even solar cells

1729
01:13:05,072 --> 01:13:06,907
on the surface of the moon.

1730
01:13:06,907 --> 01:13:09,290
We've already built a solar cell

1731
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:13,255
that is completely made from lunar regolith stimulant,

1732
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:18,088
and this solar cell is only about 7% power efficient.

1733
01:13:18,996 --> 01:13:21,614
So it's very inefficient compared to you know,

1734
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:25,555
the more advanced solar cells that we make here on earth.

1735
01:13:25,555 --> 01:13:27,332
But if you can figure out how

1736
01:13:27,332 --> 01:13:31,180
to make a practical solar cell factory

1737
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,909
that you can land on the surface of the moon,

1738
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:37,551
and then the raw material for those solar cells

1739
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:39,574
is simply lunar regolith,

1740
01:13:39,574 --> 01:13:41,791
then you can just you know, continue

1741
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:45,577
to churn out solar cells on the surface of the moon,

1742
01:13:45,577 --> 01:13:48,114
have lots of power on the surface of the moon.

1743
01:13:48,114 --> 01:13:51,254
That will make it easier for people to live on the moon.

1744
01:13:51,254 --> 01:13:55,074
Similarly, we're working on extracting

1745
01:13:55,074 --> 01:13:57,324
oxygen from lunar regolith.

1746
01:13:58,214 --> 01:14:02,516
So lunar regolith by weight has a lot of oxygen in it.

1747
01:14:02,516 --> 01:14:04,960
It's bound very tightly, you know,

1748
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,991
as oxides with other elements.

1749
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:10,793
And so you have to separate the oxygen,

1750
01:14:10,793 --> 01:14:12,791
which is very energy intensive.

1751
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:17,417
So that also could work together with the solar cells.

1752
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:18,468
But if you can,

1753
01:14:18,468 --> 01:14:22,032
and then ultimately we may be able

1754
01:14:22,032 --> 01:14:24,949
to find practical quantities of ice

1755
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:29,559
in the permanently shadowed craters

1756
01:14:29,559 --> 01:14:31,895
on the poles of the moon.

1757
01:14:31,895 --> 01:14:35,153
And we know there is ice water

1758
01:14:35,153 --> 01:14:39,299
in those, or water ice in those craters.

1759
01:14:39,299 --> 01:14:44,036
And we know that we can break that down with electrolysis

1760
01:14:44,036 --> 01:14:46,274
into hydrogen and oxygen.

1761
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:48,253
And then you'd not only have oxygen,

1762
01:14:48,253 --> 01:14:53,086
but you'd also have a very good high efficiency propellant

1763
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:55,949
fuel in hydrogen.

1764
01:14:57,176 --> 01:14:58,534
So there's a lot we can do

1765
01:14:58,534 --> 01:15:02,435
to make the moon more sustainable over time.

1766
01:15:02,435 --> 01:15:04,490
But the very first step, the thing,

1767
01:15:04,490 --> 01:15:07,654
the kind of gate that all of that has to go through

1768
01:15:07,654 --> 01:15:11,487
is we need to be able to land cargo and humans

1769
01:15:13,093 --> 01:15:16,593
on the surface of the moon at an acceptable cost.

1770
01:15:16,593 --> 01:15:18,226
- To fast forward a little bit,

1771
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:21,829
is there any chance Jeff Bezos steps foot

1772
01:15:21,829 --> 01:15:23,829
on the moon and on Mars?

1773
01:15:25,185 --> 01:15:27,848
One or the other, or both?

1774
01:15:27,848 --> 01:15:29,905
- It's very unlikely.

1775
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:33,146
I think it's probably something that gets done

1776
01:15:33,146 --> 01:15:34,789
by future generations by the time it gets to me.

1777
01:15:34,789 --> 01:15:38,228
I think in my lifetime that's probably gonna be done

1778
01:15:38,228 --> 01:15:40,679
by professional astronauts.

1779
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:43,827
Sadly, I would love to sign up for that mission.

1780
01:15:43,827 --> 01:15:46,284
So don't count me out yet, Lex, you know,

1781
01:15:46,284 --> 01:15:49,201
give me a fighting shot here maybe.

1782
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:53,908
But I think if we are placing reasonable bets

1783
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:56,250
on such a thing,

1784
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:58,308
in my lifetime, that will continue to be done

1785
01:15:58,308 --> 01:15:59,448
by professional astronauts.

1786
01:15:59,448 --> 01:16:02,449
- Yeah, so these are risky, difficult missions.

1787
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:05,332
- And probably missions that require a lot of training.

1788
01:16:05,332 --> 01:16:08,351
You know, you are going there for a very specific purpose

1789
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:09,579
to do something.

1790
01:16:09,579 --> 01:16:11,770
We're gonna be able to do a lot on the moon too

1791
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:13,027
with automation.

1792
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:15,783
So, you know, in terms of setting up these factories

1793
01:16:15,783 --> 01:16:19,226
and doing all that, we are sophisticated enough now

1794
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:21,272
with automation and we probably don't need humans

1795
01:16:21,272 --> 01:16:24,012
to tend those factories and machines.

1796
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:28,732
So there's a lot that's gonna be done in both modes.

1797
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:31,200
- So I have to ask the bigger picture question

1798
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:35,200
about the two companies pushing humanity forward

1799
01:16:36,740 --> 01:16:39,730
out towards the stars, Blue Origin and SpaceX.

1800
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:42,089
Are you competitors, collaborators?

1801
01:16:42,089 --> 01:16:44,145
Which, and to what degree?

1802
01:16:44,145 --> 01:16:47,256
- Well, I would say you know, just like the internet is big

1803
01:16:47,256 --> 01:16:49,444
and there are lots of winners at all scale levels.

1804
01:16:49,444 --> 01:16:51,795
I mean, there are half a dozen giant companies

1805
01:16:51,795 --> 01:16:54,409
that you know, the internet has made,

1806
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,268
but they're a bunch of medium sized companies

1807
01:16:56,268 --> 01:16:58,891
and a bunch of small companies, all successful,

1808
01:16:58,891 --> 01:17:00,416
all with profits, dreams,

1809
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:03,370
all driving great customer experiences.

1810
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:06,103
That's what we wanna see in space.

1811
01:17:06,103 --> 01:17:09,094
That kind of dynamism and space is big.

1812
01:17:09,094 --> 01:17:11,494
There's room for a bunch of winners

1813
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:12,875
and it's gonna happen at all skill levels.

1814
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:17,656
And so you know, SpaceX is gonna be successful for sure.

1815
01:17:17,656 --> 01:17:20,216
I want Blue Origin to be successful

1816
01:17:20,216 --> 01:17:22,457
and I hope there are another you know,

1817
01:17:22,457 --> 01:17:25,412
five companies right behind us.

1818
01:17:25,412 --> 01:17:28,948
- But, you know, I spoke to Elon a few times recently

1819
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:32,355
about you, about Blue Origin, and he was very positive

1820
01:17:32,355 --> 01:17:34,871
about you as a person and very supportive

1821
01:17:34,871 --> 01:17:37,173
of all the efforts you've been leading at Blue.

1822
01:17:37,173 --> 01:17:38,371
What's your thoughts?

1823
01:17:38,371 --> 01:17:42,351
You worked with a lot of leaders at Amazon, at Blue.

1824
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:44,435
What's your thoughts about Elon as a human being

1825
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:46,249
and a leader?

1826
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:49,235
- Well, I don't really know Elon very well.

1827
01:17:49,235 --> 01:17:52,235
You know, I know his public persona,

1828
01:17:53,113 --> 01:17:55,871
but I also know you can't know anyone

1829
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,554
by their public persona.

1830
01:17:57,554 --> 01:17:58,749
It's impossible.

1831
01:17:58,749 --> 01:18:00,628
I mean you may think you do,

1832
01:18:00,628 --> 01:18:02,273
but I guarantee you don't.

1833
01:18:02,273 --> 01:18:03,352
So I don't really know,

1834
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:06,736
you know Elon way better than I do Lex,

1835
01:18:06,736 --> 01:18:10,191
but in terms of his, judging by the results,

1836
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:13,290
he must be a very capable leader.

1837
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:16,568
There's no way you could have you know, Tesla

1838
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:19,968
and SpaceX without being a capable leader.

1839
01:18:19,968 --> 01:18:21,301
It's impossible.

1840
01:18:22,757 --> 01:18:25,894
- Yeah, I just, I hope you guys hang out sometimes,

1841
01:18:25,894 --> 01:18:30,146
shake hands, and sort of have a kind of friendship

1842
01:18:30,146 --> 01:18:32,471
that would inspire just the entirety of humanity.

1843
01:18:32,471 --> 01:18:34,468
'cause you, what you're doing

1844
01:18:34,468 --> 01:18:39,385
is like one of the big grand challenges ahead for humanity.

1845
01:18:40,408 --> 01:18:41,631
- Well, I agree with you

1846
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:44,093
and I think in a lot of these endeavors,

1847
01:18:44,093 --> 01:18:45,648
we're very like-minded.

1848
01:18:45,648 --> 01:18:46,481
- Yeah.

1849
01:18:46,481 --> 01:18:48,307
- And so I think, you know,

1850
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,495
I'm not saying we're identical,

1851
01:18:50,495 --> 01:18:51,866
but I think we're very like-minded.

1852
01:18:51,866 --> 01:18:54,949
And so I, you know, I love that idea.

1853
01:18:56,053 --> 01:18:58,967
- All right, going back to sexy pictures on your Instagram,

1854
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:03,778
there's a video of you from the early days of Amazon

1855
01:19:03,778 --> 01:19:06,593
giving a tour of your quote sort of offices.

1856
01:19:06,593 --> 01:19:07,961
I think your dad is holding the camera.

1857
01:19:07,961 --> 01:19:08,794
- He is, yeah.

1858
01:19:08,794 --> 01:19:10,093
I know, right.

1859
01:19:10,093 --> 01:19:10,926
Yes.

1860
01:19:10,926 --> 01:19:12,946
This is what the giant orange extension cord and yeah.

1861
01:19:12,946 --> 01:19:15,010
- And you're like explaining the genius

1862
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:16,809
of the extension cord and how this is a desk

1863
01:19:16,809 --> 01:19:19,392
and the CRT monitor and sort of

1864
01:19:21,147 --> 01:19:23,226
that's where all the magic happens.

1865
01:19:23,226 --> 01:19:24,778
I forget what your dad said,

1866
01:19:24,778 --> 01:19:27,309
but this is like the center of it all.

1867
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,468
So what was it like,

1868
01:19:29,468 --> 01:19:32,208
what was going through your mind at that time?

1869
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:36,469
You left a good job in New York and took this leap.

1870
01:19:36,469 --> 01:19:37,468
Were you excited?

1871
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:38,346
Were you scared?

1872
01:19:38,346 --> 01:19:40,282
- So excited and scared.

1873
01:19:40,282 --> 01:19:43,918
Anxious, you know, thought the odds of success were low,

1874
01:19:43,918 --> 01:19:45,891
told all of our early investors

1875
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:48,311
that I thought there was a 30% chance of success

1876
01:19:48,311 --> 01:19:50,790
by which I mean just be getting your money back.

1877
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:54,012
Not like, not what actually happened.

1878
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:55,132
Because that's the truth.

1879
01:19:55,132 --> 01:19:58,322
Every startup company is unlikely to work.

1880
01:19:58,322 --> 01:20:01,739
It's helpful to be in reality about that,

1881
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:05,144
but that doesn't mean you can't be optimistic.

1882
01:20:05,144 --> 01:20:07,281
So you kind of have to have this duality in your head.

1883
01:20:07,281 --> 01:20:08,306
Like on the one hand,

1884
01:20:08,306 --> 01:20:11,905
you know what the baseline statistics say

1885
01:20:11,905 --> 01:20:14,088
about startup companies.

1886
01:20:14,088 --> 01:20:16,758
And the other hand you have to ignore all of that

1887
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:19,581
and just be a hundred percent sure it's gonna work.

1888
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,069
And you're doing both things at the same time.

1889
01:20:22,069 --> 01:20:24,529
You're holding that contradiction in your head.

1890
01:20:24,529 --> 01:20:26,865
But it was so, it was so exciting.

1891
01:20:26,865 --> 01:20:29,615
I love you know, every, from 1994

1892
01:20:30,754 --> 01:20:33,854
when the company was founded to 1995,

1893
01:20:33,854 --> 01:20:35,810
when we opened our doors

1894
01:20:35,810 --> 01:20:40,785
all the way until today, I find Amazon so exciting.

1895
01:20:40,785 --> 01:20:43,667
And that doesn't mean it's like full of pain,

1896
01:20:43,667 --> 01:20:45,740
full of problems, you know,

1897
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:49,493
it's like there's so many things that need to be resolved

1898
01:20:49,493 --> 01:20:52,929
and worked and made better, and et cetera.

1899
01:20:52,929 --> 01:20:55,553
But on balance, it's so fun.

1900
01:20:55,553 --> 01:20:57,010
It's such a privilege.

1901
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:58,334
It's been such a joy.

1902
01:20:58,334 --> 01:21:03,334
I feel so grateful that I've been part of that journey.

1903
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:04,838
It's just been incredible.

1904
01:21:04,838 --> 01:21:07,758
- So in some sense, you don't want a single day of comfort.

1905
01:21:07,758 --> 01:21:10,251
You've written about this many times.

1906
01:21:10,251 --> 01:21:12,196
We'll talk about your writing,

1907
01:21:12,196 --> 01:21:14,710
which I would highly recommend people read

1908
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:17,072
and just the letters to shareholders.

1909
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:21,693
So you wrote up explaining the idea of day one thinking,

1910
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:25,995
I think you first wrote about in 97 letters to shareholders.

1911
01:21:25,995 --> 01:21:30,078
Then you also, in a way wrote it about sad to say,

1912
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:33,661
is your last letter to shareholders as CEO.

1913
01:21:35,007 --> 01:21:37,889
And you said that day two is stasis

1914
01:21:37,889 --> 01:21:40,493
followed by irrelevance,

1915
01:21:40,493 --> 01:21:45,493
followed by excruciating painful decline, followed by death.

1916
01:21:45,993 --> 01:21:49,728
And that is why it's always day one.

1917
01:21:49,728 --> 01:21:52,053
Can you explain this day one thing?

1918
01:21:52,053 --> 01:21:53,329
This is a really powerful way

1919
01:21:53,329 --> 01:21:56,152
to describe the beginning and the journey of Amazon.

1920
01:21:56,152 --> 01:21:58,485
- It's really a very simple,

1921
01:22:00,313 --> 01:22:05,132
and I think age old idea about renewal and rebirth.

1922
01:22:05,132 --> 01:22:07,632
And like every day is day one.

1923
01:22:08,493 --> 01:22:12,308
Every day you are deciding what you're gonna do.

1924
01:22:12,308 --> 01:22:14,225
And you are not trapped

1925
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:18,527
by what you were or who you were,

1926
01:22:18,527 --> 01:22:20,911
or any self-consistency.

1927
01:22:20,911 --> 01:22:23,969
Self-consistency even can be a trap.

1928
01:22:23,969 --> 01:22:26,886
And so day one thinking is kind of,

1929
01:22:27,727 --> 01:22:30,312
we start fresh every day

1930
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:35,312
and we get to make new decisions every day about invention,

1931
01:22:35,892 --> 01:22:40,767
about customers, about how we're going to operate,

1932
01:22:40,767 --> 01:22:44,513
what our, even as deeply as what our principles are.

1933
01:22:44,513 --> 01:22:45,854
We can go back to that.

1934
01:22:45,854 --> 01:22:48,013
It turns out we don't change those very often,

1935
01:22:48,013 --> 01:22:50,515
but we change them occasionally.

1936
01:22:50,515 --> 01:22:53,765
And when we work on programs at Amazon,

1937
01:22:56,175 --> 01:22:59,234
we often make a list of tenants.

1938
01:22:59,234 --> 01:23:02,114
And this, the tenants are kind of,

1939
01:23:02,114 --> 01:23:03,373
they're not principles.

1940
01:23:03,373 --> 01:23:05,701
They're a little more tactical than principles,

1941
01:23:05,701 --> 01:23:08,755
but it's kind of the main ideas

1942
01:23:08,755 --> 01:23:10,642
that we want this program to embody,

1943
01:23:10,642 --> 01:23:12,587
whatever those are.

1944
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:15,453
And one of the things that we do

1945
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:17,550
is we put, these are the tenets for this program.

1946
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:19,633
And in parentheses we always put,

1947
01:23:19,633 --> 01:23:22,837
unless you know a better way.

1948
01:23:22,837 --> 01:23:26,504
And that idea, unless you know a better way,

1949
01:23:28,195 --> 01:23:30,872
is so important because you never want

1950
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,192
to get trapped by dogma.

1951
01:23:33,192 --> 01:23:35,475
You never wanna get trapped by history.

1952
01:23:35,475 --> 01:23:38,871
It doesn't mean you discard history or ignore it.

1953
01:23:38,871 --> 01:23:42,412
There's so much value in what has worked in the past.

1954
01:23:42,412 --> 01:23:46,609
But you can't be blindly following what you've done.

1955
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:48,673
And that's the heart of day one

1956
01:23:48,673 --> 01:23:51,270
is you're always starting fresh.

1957
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:54,603
- And to the question of how to fend off day two,

1958
01:23:54,603 --> 01:23:55,724
you said such a question,

1959
01:23:55,724 --> 01:23:58,172
can't have a simple answer as you're saying,

1960
01:23:58,172 --> 01:24:01,249
there will be many elements, multiple paths, and many traps.

1961
01:24:01,249 --> 01:24:03,170
I don't know the whole answer,

1962
01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:05,091
but I may know bits of it.

1963
01:24:05,091 --> 01:24:07,189
Here's a starter pack of essentials.

1964
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:10,630
Maybe others come to mind for day one, defense,

1965
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:14,392
customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies,

1966
01:24:14,392 --> 01:24:17,120
the eager adoption of external trends

1967
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,453
and high velocity decision making.

1968
01:24:19,453 --> 01:24:22,275
So we talked about high velocity decision making,

1969
01:24:22,275 --> 01:24:24,672
that's more difficult than it sounds.

1970
01:24:24,672 --> 01:24:28,088
So maybe you can pick one that stands out to you

1971
01:24:28,088 --> 01:24:29,792
as you can comment on.

1972
01:24:29,792 --> 01:24:32,195
Eager adoption of external trends,

1973
01:24:32,195 --> 01:24:33,490
high velocity decision making,

1974
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:35,066
skeptical view of proxies.

1975
01:24:35,066 --> 01:24:36,680
How do you fight off day two?

1976
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:38,471
- Well, you know, I'll talk about,

1977
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:41,855
because I think it's the one that is maybe in some ways

1978
01:24:41,855 --> 01:24:46,772
the hardest to understand is the skeptical view of proxies.

1979
01:24:49,413 --> 01:24:52,832
One of the things that happens in business,

1980
01:24:52,832 --> 01:24:54,655
probably anything that you're,

1981
01:24:54,655 --> 01:24:58,129
where you're you know, you have an ongoing program

1982
01:24:58,129 --> 01:25:01,728
and something is underway for a number of years,

1983
01:25:01,728 --> 01:25:04,761
is you develop certain things that you're managing to

1984
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:08,117
like, let's say the typical case would be a metric.

1985
01:25:08,117 --> 01:25:12,929
And that metric isn't the real underlying thing.

1986
01:25:12,929 --> 01:25:15,679
And so you know, maybe the metric

1987
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:20,412
is efficiency metric around customer contacts

1988
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:22,438
per unit sold or something.

1989
01:25:22,438 --> 01:25:24,609
If you sell a million units,

1990
01:25:24,609 --> 01:25:26,652
how many customer contacts do you get?

1991
01:25:26,652 --> 01:25:28,705
Or how many returns do you get?

1992
01:25:28,705 --> 01:25:29,630
And so on and so on.

1993
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:31,935
And so what happens is a little bit

1994
01:25:31,935 --> 01:25:34,435
of a kind of a inertia sets in

1995
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:40,334
where somebody a long time ago invented that metric

1996
01:25:40,334 --> 01:25:42,070
and they invented that metric.

1997
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:44,915
They decided we need to watch for you know,

1998
01:25:44,915 --> 01:25:49,915
customer returns per unit sold as an important metric.

1999
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:53,552
But they had a reason why they chose that metric.

2000
01:25:53,552 --> 01:25:55,532
The person who invented that metric

2001
01:25:55,532 --> 01:25:57,715
and decided it was worth watching.

2002
01:25:57,715 --> 01:25:59,456
And then fast forward five years,

2003
01:25:59,456 --> 01:26:01,313
that metric is the proxy.

2004
01:26:01,313 --> 01:26:03,090
- The proxy for truth, I guess.

2005
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:06,245
- The proxy for truth, the proxy for customer,

2006
01:26:06,245 --> 01:26:09,696
let's say in this case, it's a proxy for customer happiness.

2007
01:26:09,696 --> 01:26:12,813
And, but that metric is not actually customer happiness,

2008
01:26:12,813 --> 01:26:15,553
it's a proxy for customer happiness.

2009
01:26:15,553 --> 01:26:17,767
The person who invented the metric

2010
01:26:17,767 --> 01:26:20,354
understood that connection.

2011
01:26:20,354 --> 01:26:24,187
Five years later, a kind of inertia can set in

2012
01:26:25,637 --> 01:26:27,637
and you forget the truth

2013
01:26:29,054 --> 01:26:32,048
behind why you were watching that metric in the first place.

2014
01:26:32,048 --> 01:26:34,733
And the world shifts a little.

2015
01:26:34,733 --> 01:26:38,117
And now that proxy isn't as valuable as it used to be

2016
01:26:38,117 --> 01:26:40,689
or it's missing something.

2017
01:26:40,689 --> 01:26:42,529
And you have to be on alert for that.

2018
01:26:42,529 --> 01:26:44,487
You have to know, okay, this is,

2019
01:26:44,487 --> 01:26:46,772
I don't really care about this metric.

2020
01:26:46,772 --> 01:26:49,674
I care about customer happiness.

2021
01:26:49,674 --> 01:26:53,341
And this metric is worth putting energy into

2022
01:26:54,853 --> 01:26:58,371
and following and improving and scrutinizing

2023
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:03,371
only in so much as it actually affects customer happiness.

2024
01:27:03,405 --> 01:27:05,368
And so you've gotta constantly be on guard.

2025
01:27:05,368 --> 01:27:07,194
And it's very, very common.

2026
01:27:07,194 --> 01:27:09,371
This is a nuanced problem.

2027
01:27:09,371 --> 01:27:12,593
It's very common, especially in large companies,

2028
01:27:12,593 --> 01:27:14,915
that they're managing to metrics

2029
01:27:14,915 --> 01:27:17,034
that they don't really understand.

2030
01:27:17,034 --> 01:27:19,510
They don't really know why they exist.

2031
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:22,357
And the world may have shifted out from under them a little.

2032
01:27:22,357 --> 01:27:25,487
And the metrics are no longer as relevant as they were

2033
01:27:25,487 --> 01:27:29,469
when somebody 10 years earlier invented the metric.

2034
01:27:29,469 --> 01:27:33,717
- That is a nuance, but that's a big problem, right?

2035
01:27:33,717 --> 01:27:34,815
- It's a huge problem.

2036
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:36,171
- That something so compelling

2037
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:38,768
to have a nice metric to try to optimize.

2038
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:39,601
- Yes.

2039
01:27:39,601 --> 01:27:41,429
And by the way, you do need metrics.

2040
01:27:41,429 --> 01:27:42,262
- Yes you do.

2041
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:45,765
- You know, you can't ignore them, and want them,

2042
01:27:45,765 --> 01:27:48,450
but you just have to be constantly on guard.

2043
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:52,046
This is, you know, a way to slip into day two thinking

2044
01:27:52,046 --> 01:27:54,865
would be to manage your business to metrics

2045
01:27:54,865 --> 01:27:56,928
that you don't really understand.

2046
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:59,236
And you're not really sure why they were invented

2047
01:27:59,236 --> 01:28:00,069
in the first place,

2048
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:02,336
and you're not sure they're still as relevant

2049
01:28:02,336 --> 01:28:03,348
as they used to be.

2050
01:28:03,348 --> 01:28:05,854
- What does it take to be the guy or gal

2051
01:28:05,854 --> 01:28:09,993
who brings up the point that this proxy might be outdated?

2052
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:13,011
I guess what does it take to have a culture

2053
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:14,712
that enables that in the meeting?

2054
01:28:14,712 --> 01:28:16,799
'Cause that's a very uncomfortable thing

2055
01:28:16,799 --> 01:28:18,018
to bring up at a meeting.

2056
01:28:18,018 --> 01:28:20,070
We all showed up here, it's a Friday.

2057
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:21,408
- This is such,

2058
01:28:21,408 --> 01:28:25,248
you have just asked a million dollar question.

2059
01:28:25,248 --> 01:28:27,872
So this is what you're,

2060
01:28:27,872 --> 01:28:31,454
if I generalize what you're asking,

2061
01:28:31,454 --> 01:28:34,995
you are talking in general about truth telling.

2062
01:28:34,995 --> 01:28:36,006
- Yeah.

2063
01:28:36,006 --> 01:28:40,423
- And we humans are not really truth seeking animals.

2064
01:28:41,328 --> 01:28:43,296
We are social animals.

2065
01:28:43,296 --> 01:28:44,308
- Yeah, we are.

2066
01:28:44,308 --> 01:28:47,392
- And you know, take you back in time 10,000 years

2067
01:28:47,392 --> 01:28:49,852
and you're in a small village,

2068
01:28:49,852 --> 01:28:53,652
if you go along to get along, you can survive.

2069
01:28:53,652 --> 01:28:55,353
You can procreate.

2070
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:58,093
If you're the village truth teller,

2071
01:28:58,093 --> 01:29:01,130
you might get clubbed to death in the middle of the night.

2072
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:05,250
Truths are often, they don't want to be heard.

2073
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:09,000
'Cause important truths can be uncomfortable,

2074
01:29:10,232 --> 01:29:12,838
they can be awkward, they can be exhausting.

2075
01:29:12,838 --> 01:29:15,833
- Impolite and all that kind of stuff.

2076
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:16,837
- Yes, challenging.

2077
01:29:16,837 --> 01:29:18,031
They can make people defensive

2078
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:19,751
even if that's not the intent.

2079
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:22,549
But any high performing organization,

2080
01:29:22,549 --> 01:29:24,837
whether it's a sports team, a business, you know,

2081
01:29:24,837 --> 01:29:27,489
a political organization, an activist group,

2082
01:29:27,489 --> 01:29:29,310
I don't care what it is.

2083
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:32,453
Any high performing organization

2084
01:29:32,453 --> 01:29:35,453
has to have mechanisms and a culture

2085
01:29:36,593 --> 01:29:38,409
that supports truth telling.

2086
01:29:38,409 --> 01:29:40,034
One of the things you have to do

2087
01:29:40,034 --> 01:29:41,352
is you have to talk about that.

2088
01:29:41,352 --> 01:29:42,887
And you have to talk about the fact

2089
01:29:42,887 --> 01:29:45,519
that it takes energy to do that.

2090
01:29:45,519 --> 01:29:46,714
And you have to talk to people,

2091
01:29:46,714 --> 01:29:50,413
you have to remind people it's okay that it's uncomfortable.

2092
01:29:50,413 --> 01:29:53,914
You have to literally tell people

2093
01:29:53,914 --> 01:29:56,514
it's not what we're designed to do as humans.

2094
01:29:56,514 --> 01:29:59,556
It's not really, it's kind of a side effect.

2095
01:29:59,556 --> 01:30:01,088
You know, we can do that,

2096
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,670
but it's not how we survive.

2097
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:05,593
We mostly survive by being social animals

2098
01:30:05,593 --> 01:30:08,171
and being cordial and cooperative.

2099
01:30:08,171 --> 01:30:10,771
And that's really important.

2100
01:30:10,771 --> 01:30:12,635
And so there's a, you know,

2101
01:30:12,635 --> 01:30:14,771
science is all about truth telling.

2102
01:30:14,771 --> 01:30:17,854
It's actually a very formal mechanism

2103
01:30:18,916 --> 01:30:22,088
for trying to tell the truth.

2104
01:30:22,088 --> 01:30:24,193
And even in science,

2105
01:30:24,193 --> 01:30:27,270
you find that it's hard to tell the truth.

2106
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:28,103
Right.

2107
01:30:29,148 --> 01:30:31,630
Even, you know, you're supposed to have hypothesis

2108
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:34,289
and test it and find data and reject the hypothesis,

2109
01:30:34,289 --> 01:30:35,122
and so on.

2110
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:37,775
It's not easy.

2111
01:30:37,775 --> 01:30:40,327
- But even in science, there's like the senior scientists

2112
01:30:40,327 --> 01:30:41,546
and the junior scientists.

2113
01:30:41,546 --> 01:30:42,379
- Correct.

2114
01:30:42,379 --> 01:30:43,877
- And then there's a hierarchy of humans

2115
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:46,130
where somehow seniority matters.

2116
01:30:46,130 --> 01:30:46,963
- Yes.

2117
01:30:47,921 --> 01:30:49,810
- In the scientific process, which is odd.

2118
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:52,596
- And that's true inside companies too.

2119
01:30:52,596 --> 01:30:55,553
And so you wanna set up your culture

2120
01:30:55,553 --> 01:30:58,769
so that the most junior person

2121
01:30:58,769 --> 01:31:03,269
can overrule the most senior person if they have data.

2122
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:07,897
And that really is about trying to you know,

2123
01:31:09,135 --> 01:31:10,731
there are little things you can do.

2124
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:13,602
So for example, in every meeting that I attend,

2125
01:31:13,602 --> 01:31:15,269
I always speak last.

2126
01:31:16,375 --> 01:31:19,042
And I know from experience that,

2127
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,726
you know, if I speak first,

2128
01:31:24,756 --> 01:31:28,423
even very strong-willed, highly intelligent,

2129
01:31:31,275 --> 01:31:35,086
high judgment participants in that meeting

2130
01:31:35,086 --> 01:31:38,975
will wonder, well if Jeff thinks that

2131
01:31:38,975 --> 01:31:41,172
I came in this meeting thinking one thing,

2132
01:31:41,172 --> 01:31:43,172
but maybe I'm not right.

2133
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:47,233
And so you can do little things

2134
01:31:47,233 --> 01:31:52,129
like if you're the most senior person in the room, go last.

2135
01:31:52,129 --> 01:31:53,456
Let everybody else go first.

2136
01:31:53,456 --> 01:31:57,693
In fact, ideally let's try to have the most junior person

2137
01:31:57,693 --> 01:32:00,393
go first and the second and try to go in order

2138
01:32:00,393 --> 01:32:04,726
of seniority so that you can hear everyone's opinion

2139
01:32:05,693 --> 01:32:07,762
in a kind of unfiltered way.

2140
01:32:07,762 --> 01:32:09,251
Because we really do,

2141
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:11,602
we actually literally change our opinions.

2142
01:32:11,602 --> 01:32:15,434
If somebody who you really respect says something,

2143
01:32:15,434 --> 01:32:17,512
it makes you change your mind a little.

2144
01:32:17,512 --> 01:32:21,372
- So you're saying implicitly or explicitly

2145
01:32:21,372 --> 01:32:25,816
give permission for people to have a strong opinion

2146
01:32:25,816 --> 01:32:27,694
as long as it's backed by data.

2147
01:32:27,694 --> 01:32:28,527
- Yes.

2148
01:32:28,527 --> 01:32:30,747
And sometimes it can even, by the way,

2149
01:32:30,747 --> 01:32:34,416
a lot of our most powerful truths turn out to be hunches.

2150
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:36,867
They turn out to be based on anecdotes.

2151
01:32:36,867 --> 01:32:38,613
They're intuition based.

2152
01:32:38,613 --> 01:32:41,709
And sometimes you don't even have strong data,

2153
01:32:41,709 --> 01:32:44,871
but you may know the person well enough

2154
01:32:44,871 --> 01:32:45,924
to trust their judgment.

2155
01:32:45,924 --> 01:32:47,678
You may feel yourself leaning in.

2156
01:32:47,678 --> 01:32:51,012
It may resonate with a set of anecdotes you have.

2157
01:32:51,012 --> 01:32:53,052
And then you may be able to say you know,

2158
01:32:53,052 --> 01:32:55,802
something about that feels right.

2159
01:32:56,753 --> 01:32:58,692
Let's go collect some data on that.

2160
01:32:58,692 --> 01:33:02,868
Let's try to see if we can actually know whether it's right.

2161
01:33:02,868 --> 01:33:05,208
But for now, let's not disregard it

2162
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,732
'cause it feels right.

2163
01:33:06,732 --> 01:33:08,411
You can also fight inherent bias.

2164
01:33:08,411 --> 01:33:10,772
There's an optimism bias.

2165
01:33:10,772 --> 01:33:14,134
Like if there are two interpretations of a new set of data

2166
01:33:14,134 --> 01:33:18,232
and one of them is happy and one of 'em is unhappy,

2167
01:33:18,232 --> 01:33:20,626
it's a little dangerous to jump to the conclusion

2168
01:33:20,626 --> 01:33:23,056
that the happy interpretation is right.

2169
01:33:23,056 --> 01:33:27,833
You may want to sort of compensate for that human bias

2170
01:33:27,833 --> 01:33:31,590
of looking for you know, trying to find the silver lining

2171
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:32,950
and say look, that might be good,

2172
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:36,610
but I'm gonna go with it's bad for now until we're sure.

2173
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:40,124
- So speaking of happiness bias, data collection,

2174
01:33:40,124 --> 01:33:42,253
and anecdotes, you have to,

2175
01:33:42,253 --> 01:33:45,263
how's that for a transition?

2176
01:33:45,263 --> 01:33:49,513
You have to tell me the story of the call you made,

2177
01:33:51,478 --> 01:33:53,146
the customer service call you made

2178
01:33:53,146 --> 01:33:56,479
to demonstrate a point about wait times.

2179
01:33:57,365 --> 01:34:00,985
- Yeah, this is very early in the history of Amazon.

2180
01:34:00,985 --> 01:34:05,120
And we were going over a weekly business review

2181
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,228
and a set of documents, and I have a saying,

2182
01:34:09,228 --> 01:34:12,259
which is when the data and the anecdotes disagree,

2183
01:34:12,259 --> 01:34:14,505
the anecdotes are usually right.

2184
01:34:14,505 --> 01:34:17,749
And it doesn't mean you just slavishly

2185
01:34:17,749 --> 01:34:19,213
go follow the anecdotes then.

2186
01:34:19,213 --> 01:34:20,908
It means you go examine the data.

2187
01:34:20,908 --> 01:34:21,787
'Cause the data,

2188
01:34:21,787 --> 01:34:26,169
and it's usually not that the data is being miscollected,

2189
01:34:26,169 --> 01:34:30,179
it's usually that you're not measuring the right thing.

2190
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:32,619
And so, you know, if you have a bunch of customers

2191
01:34:32,619 --> 01:34:34,607
complaining about something,

2192
01:34:34,607 --> 01:34:37,073
and at the same time, you know,

2193
01:34:37,073 --> 01:34:38,981
your metrics look like why are,

2194
01:34:38,981 --> 01:34:41,763
they shouldn't be complaining.

2195
01:34:41,763 --> 01:34:43,832
You should doubt the metrics.

2196
01:34:43,832 --> 01:34:47,749
And an early example of this was we had metrics

2197
01:34:48,865 --> 01:34:51,932
that showed that our customers were waiting,

2198
01:34:51,932 --> 01:34:54,490
I think less than I don't know, 60 seconds

2199
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:57,122
when they called a 1-800 number to get,

2200
01:34:57,122 --> 01:34:59,192
you know, phone customer service.

2201
01:34:59,192 --> 01:35:02,733
The wait time was supposed to be less than 60 seconds.

2202
01:35:02,733 --> 01:35:04,689
And, but we had a lot of complaints

2203
01:35:04,689 --> 01:35:06,529
that it was longer than that.

2204
01:35:06,529 --> 01:35:09,723
And anecdotally it seemed longer than that.

2205
01:35:09,723 --> 01:35:12,311
Like, you know, I would call customer service myself.

2206
01:35:12,311 --> 01:35:14,361
And so one day we're in a meeting, we're going

2207
01:35:14,361 --> 01:35:17,840
through the WBR and the weekly business review,

2208
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:20,507
and we get to this metric in the deck,

2209
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:23,247
and the guy who leads customer service

2210
01:35:23,247 --> 01:35:24,490
is to fit in the metric.

2211
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:25,636
And I said, okay,

2212
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:28,219
let's call picked up the phone.

2213
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:34,920
And I dialed the 1-800 number and called customer service.

2214
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,420
And we just waited in silence.

2215
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:40,120
- What did it turn out to be, like a couple minutes?

2216
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,165
- Oh, it was really long.

2217
01:35:41,165 --> 01:35:42,844
More than 10 minutes, I think.

2218
01:35:42,844 --> 01:35:43,677
- Oh wow.

2219
01:35:43,677 --> 01:35:45,411
- I mean it was many minutes.

2220
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:47,989
And so, you know, it dramatically made the point

2221
01:35:47,989 --> 01:35:50,441
that something was wrong with the data collection.

2222
01:35:50,441 --> 01:35:52,767
We weren't measuring the right thing.

2223
01:35:52,767 --> 01:35:54,379
And that, you know, set off a whole chain of events

2224
01:35:54,379 --> 01:35:56,083
where we started measuring it right.

2225
01:35:56,083 --> 01:36:00,859
And that's an example by the way of truth telling,

2226
01:36:00,859 --> 01:36:03,483
is like that's an uncomfortable thing to do.

2227
01:36:03,483 --> 01:36:08,066
But you have to seek truth even when it's uncomfortable

2228
01:36:09,142 --> 01:36:11,028
and you have to get people's attention

2229
01:36:11,028 --> 01:36:13,327
and they have to buy into it,

2230
01:36:13,327 --> 01:36:16,180
and they have to get energized around really fixing things.

2231
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:19,045
- So that speaks to the obsession

2232
01:36:19,045 --> 01:36:19,942
with the customer experience.

2233
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:22,953
So one of the defining aspects of your approach

2234
01:36:22,953 --> 01:36:25,772
to Amazon is just being obsessed

2235
01:36:25,772 --> 01:36:27,085
with making customers happy.

2236
01:36:27,085 --> 01:36:30,504
I think companies sometimes say that,

2237
01:36:30,504 --> 01:36:34,283
but Amazon is really obsessed with that.

2238
01:36:34,283 --> 01:36:37,294
I think there's something really profound to that,

2239
01:36:37,294 --> 01:36:39,769
which is seeing the world through the eyes of the customer,

2240
01:36:39,769 --> 01:36:43,130
like the customer experience, truly like being,

2241
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:46,624
that's using the product, that's enjoying the product.

2242
01:36:46,624 --> 01:36:49,457
They like the subtle little things

2243
01:36:50,354 --> 01:36:52,566
that make up their experience.

2244
01:36:52,566 --> 01:36:55,245
Like how do you optimize those?

2245
01:36:55,245 --> 01:36:57,662
- This is another really good

2246
01:37:00,284 --> 01:37:02,466
and kind of deep question

2247
01:37:02,466 --> 01:37:04,730
because there are big things

2248
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:07,145
that are really important to manage.

2249
01:37:07,145 --> 01:37:11,447
And then there are small things internally in Amazon,

2250
01:37:11,447 --> 01:37:13,449
we call them paper cuts.

2251
01:37:13,449 --> 01:37:16,526
So we have, we're always working on the big things,

2252
01:37:16,526 --> 01:37:17,606
like if you ask me,

2253
01:37:17,606 --> 01:37:20,284
and most of the energy goes into the big things

2254
01:37:20,284 --> 01:37:21,421
as it should.

2255
01:37:21,421 --> 01:37:23,765
So, and you can identify the big things.

2256
01:37:23,765 --> 01:37:25,765
And and I would encourage anybody

2257
01:37:25,765 --> 01:37:29,482
if anybody listening to this as a entrepreneur,

2258
01:37:29,482 --> 01:37:32,065
has a small business, whatever,

2259
01:37:33,082 --> 01:37:34,663
you know, think about the things

2260
01:37:34,663 --> 01:37:37,087
that are not going to change over 10 years.

2261
01:37:37,087 --> 01:37:38,707
And those are probably the big things.

2262
01:37:38,707 --> 01:37:43,252
So like I know in our retail business at Amazon,

2263
01:37:43,252 --> 01:37:44,407
10 years from now,

2264
01:37:44,407 --> 01:37:45,905
customers are still gonna want low prices.

2265
01:37:45,905 --> 01:37:47,942
I know they're still gonna want fast delivery.

2266
01:37:47,942 --> 01:37:50,386
And I just know they're still gonna want big selection.

2267
01:37:50,386 --> 01:37:53,208
So it's impossible to imagine a scenario

2268
01:37:53,208 --> 01:37:55,483
where 10 years from now I say,

2269
01:37:55,483 --> 01:37:57,126
where a customer says, I love Amazon,

2270
01:37:57,126 --> 01:37:59,129
I just wish the prices were a little higher.

2271
01:37:59,129 --> 01:38:00,226
Or I love Amazon,

2272
01:38:00,226 --> 01:38:02,568
I just wish you delivered a little more slowly.

2273
01:38:02,568 --> 01:38:05,862
So when you identify the big things,

2274
01:38:05,862 --> 01:38:08,580
you can tell they're worth putting energy into

2275
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:10,901
because they're stable in time.

2276
01:38:10,901 --> 01:38:14,425
Okay, but you're asking about something a little different,

2277
01:38:14,425 --> 01:38:16,886
which is in every customer experience,

2278
01:38:16,886 --> 01:38:18,584
there are those big things.

2279
01:38:18,584 --> 01:38:20,864
And by the way, it's astonishingly hard to focus

2280
01:38:20,864 --> 01:38:22,569
even on just the big things.

2281
01:38:22,569 --> 01:38:24,746
So even though they're obvious,

2282
01:38:24,746 --> 01:38:27,184
they're really hard to focus on.

2283
01:38:27,184 --> 01:38:28,949
But in addition to that,

2284
01:38:28,949 --> 01:38:30,859
there are all these little tiny

2285
01:38:30,859 --> 01:38:33,906
customer experience deficiencies.

2286
01:38:33,906 --> 01:38:35,781
And we call those paper cuts

2287
01:38:35,781 --> 01:38:38,225
and we make long lists of them.

2288
01:38:38,225 --> 01:38:42,808
And then we have dedicated teams that go fix paper cuts

2289
01:38:44,849 --> 01:38:47,386
because the teams working on the big issues

2290
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:49,864
never get to the paper cuts

2291
01:38:49,864 --> 01:38:52,831
and they never work their way down the list to get to,

2292
01:38:52,831 --> 01:38:56,623
they're working on big things as they should

2293
01:38:56,623 --> 01:38:58,566
and as you want them to.

2294
01:38:58,566 --> 01:39:01,034
And so you need special teams

2295
01:39:01,034 --> 01:39:04,900
who are charged with fixing paper cuts.

2296
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:08,318
- Well, where would you put, on the paper cuts spectrum,

2297
01:39:08,318 --> 01:39:10,202
the buy now with one click button,

2298
01:39:10,202 --> 01:39:12,364
which is I think pretty genius.

2299
01:39:12,364 --> 01:39:14,686
So to me like, okay,

2300
01:39:14,686 --> 01:39:18,381
my interaction with things I love on the internet,

2301
01:39:18,381 --> 01:39:19,879
there's things I do a lot.

2302
01:39:19,879 --> 01:39:22,523
I may be representing regular human,

2303
01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:25,642
I would love for those things to be frictionless.

2304
01:39:25,642 --> 01:39:28,849
For example, booking airline tickets.

2305
01:39:28,849 --> 01:39:32,682
Just saying, but you know, it's buying a thing

2306
01:39:35,126 --> 01:39:38,824
with one click, making that experience frictionless,

2307
01:39:38,824 --> 01:39:41,038
intuitive, all aspects of that.

2308
01:39:41,038 --> 01:39:45,205
Like that just fundamentally makes my life better.

2309
01:39:46,225 --> 01:39:47,702
Not just in terms of efficiency,

2310
01:39:47,702 --> 01:39:49,029
in terms of some kind of-

2311
01:39:49,029 --> 01:39:50,068
- Cognitive load.

2312
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:53,725
- Yeah, cognitive load and inner peace and happiness.

2313
01:39:53,725 --> 01:39:58,360
First of all, buying stuff isn't a pleasant experience.

2314
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,184
Having enough money to buy a thing

2315
01:40:01,184 --> 01:40:04,424
and then buying it is a pleasant experience.

2316
01:40:04,424 --> 01:40:06,524
And like having pain around that is somehow

2317
01:40:06,524 --> 01:40:10,066
just you're ruining a beautiful experience.

2318
01:40:10,066 --> 01:40:12,365
And I guess all I'm saying

2319
01:40:12,365 --> 01:40:16,126
as a person who loves good ideas, is that a paper cut,

2320
01:40:16,126 --> 01:40:17,462
a solution to a paper cut?

2321
01:40:17,462 --> 01:40:18,466
- Yes.

2322
01:40:18,466 --> 01:40:20,887
So it's probably, that particular thing

2323
01:40:20,887 --> 01:40:23,404
is probably a solution to a number of paper cuts.

2324
01:40:23,404 --> 01:40:25,850
So if you go back and look at our order pipeline

2325
01:40:25,850 --> 01:40:27,725
and how people shopped on Amazon,

2326
01:40:27,725 --> 01:40:30,447
before we invented 1-click shopping,

2327
01:40:30,447 --> 01:40:32,843
there were a whole, there was more friction.

2328
01:40:32,843 --> 01:40:36,087
There was a whole series of paper cuts

2329
01:40:36,087 --> 01:40:40,525
and that invention eliminated a bunch of paper cuts.

2330
01:40:40,525 --> 01:40:44,263
And I think you're absolutely right by the way,

2331
01:40:44,263 --> 01:40:47,059
that there, when you come up with something

2332
01:40:47,059 --> 01:40:48,617
like 1-click shopping,

2333
01:40:48,617 --> 01:40:51,827
again, this is like so ingrained in people now,

2334
01:40:51,827 --> 01:40:54,353
I'm impressed that you even notice it.

2335
01:40:54,353 --> 01:40:55,203
I mean, most people-

2336
01:40:55,203 --> 01:40:56,506
- Every time I click the button.

2337
01:40:56,506 --> 01:40:58,923
- I just, surge of happiness.

2338
01:41:00,801 --> 01:41:03,987
- This, there is in the perfect invention

2339
01:41:03,987 --> 01:41:06,682
for the perfect moment, in the perfect context,

2340
01:41:06,682 --> 01:41:08,981
there is real beauty.

2341
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:10,008
- Yeah.

2342
01:41:10,008 --> 01:41:11,898
- It is actual beauty.

2343
01:41:11,898 --> 01:41:13,509
And it feels good.

2344
01:41:13,509 --> 01:41:16,680
It's emotional, it's emotional for the inventor,

2345
01:41:16,680 --> 01:41:18,704
it's emotional for the team that builds it.

2346
01:41:18,704 --> 01:41:20,405
It's emotional for the customer.

2347
01:41:20,405 --> 01:41:21,450
It's a big deal.

2348
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,563
And you can feel those things.

2349
01:41:23,563 --> 01:41:26,242
- But to keep coming up with that idea,

2350
01:41:26,242 --> 01:41:27,525
with those kinds of ideas,

2351
01:41:27,525 --> 01:41:28,985
I guess is the the day one thinking effort.

2352
01:41:28,985 --> 01:41:32,421
- Yeah, and you need a big group of people

2353
01:41:32,421 --> 01:41:35,700
who feel that kind of satisfaction

2354
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,189
with creating that kind of beauty.

2355
01:41:38,189 --> 01:41:41,738
- There's a lot of books written about you.

2356
01:41:41,738 --> 01:41:43,863
There's a book Invent and Wander

2357
01:41:43,863 --> 01:41:46,086
where Walter Isaacson does an intro.

2358
01:41:46,086 --> 01:41:48,403
It's mostly collective writings of yours.

2359
01:41:48,403 --> 01:41:49,622
I've read that.

2360
01:41:49,622 --> 01:41:53,105
I also recommend people check out the Founders Podcast.

2361
01:41:53,105 --> 01:41:56,938
That covers you a lot and it does different analysis

2362
01:41:56,938 --> 01:41:59,999
of different business advice you've given over the years.

2363
01:41:59,999 --> 01:42:03,749
I bring all that up because I saw that there,

2364
01:42:05,154 --> 01:42:07,736
I mentioned that you said that books are an antidote

2365
01:42:07,736 --> 01:42:10,363
for short attention spans.

2366
01:42:10,363 --> 01:42:13,180
And I forget how it was phrased,

2367
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:15,320
but that when you were thinking about the Kindle,

2368
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:19,820
that you are thinking about how technology changes us.

2369
01:42:21,485 --> 01:42:22,318
Yeah.

2370
01:42:22,318 --> 01:42:24,818
- We co-evolve with our tools.

2371
01:42:26,466 --> 01:42:29,049
So, you know, we invent new tools

2372
01:42:29,049 --> 01:42:30,901
and then our tools change us.

2373
01:42:30,901 --> 01:42:32,796
- Which is fascinating to think about.

2374
01:42:32,796 --> 01:42:33,797
- It goes in a circle.

2375
01:42:33,797 --> 01:42:35,623
- And there's some aspect, you know,

2376
01:42:35,623 --> 01:42:37,731
even just inside business

2377
01:42:37,731 --> 01:42:40,305
where you don't just make the customer happy,

2378
01:42:40,305 --> 01:42:41,701
but you also have to think about like

2379
01:42:41,701 --> 01:42:44,125
where is this going to take humanity

2380
01:42:44,125 --> 01:42:45,367
if you zoom out a bit.

2381
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:47,205
- A hundred percent.

2382
01:42:47,205 --> 01:42:50,622
And you know, you can feel in your brain,

2383
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,166
brains are plastic,

2384
01:42:55,166 --> 01:42:57,482
and you can feel your brain getting reprogrammed.

2385
01:42:57,482 --> 01:43:00,367
I remember the first time this happened to me

2386
01:43:00,367 --> 01:43:04,785
was when Tetris, it first came on the scene.

2387
01:43:04,785 --> 01:43:06,009
I'm sure you've had,

2388
01:43:06,009 --> 01:43:09,061
anybody who's been a game player has this experience

2389
01:43:09,061 --> 01:43:12,163
where you close your eyes to lay down to go to sleep

2390
01:43:12,163 --> 01:43:15,580
and you see all the little blocks moving.

2391
01:43:16,805 --> 01:43:19,222
And you can, you're kind of rotating them in your mind

2392
01:43:19,222 --> 01:43:21,927
and you can just tell as you walk around the world

2393
01:43:21,927 --> 01:43:25,944
that you have rewired your brain to play Tetris.

2394
01:43:25,944 --> 01:43:29,111
And, but that happens with everything.

2395
01:43:30,042 --> 01:43:33,875
And so, you know, one of the, I think we still

2396
01:43:34,763 --> 01:43:38,088
have yet to see the full repercussions of this, I fear.

2397
01:43:38,088 --> 01:43:42,077
But I think one of the things that we've done online,

2398
01:43:42,077 --> 01:43:44,377
you know, and largely because of social media

2399
01:43:44,377 --> 01:43:47,863
is we have trained our brains to be really good

2400
01:43:47,863 --> 01:43:51,443
at processing super short form content.

2401
01:43:51,443 --> 01:43:55,369
And, you know, your podcast flies in the face of this.

2402
01:43:55,369 --> 01:43:58,385
You know, you do these long format things

2403
01:43:58,385 --> 01:44:00,760
and reading books do too.

2404
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:03,003
Reading books is a long format thing.

2405
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:05,644
And we all do more of if you,

2406
01:44:05,644 --> 01:44:09,586
if something is convenient, we do more of it.

2407
01:44:09,586 --> 01:44:11,542
And so when you make tools,

2408
01:44:11,542 --> 01:44:15,191
you know that we carry around a little,

2409
01:44:15,191 --> 01:44:17,845
we carry around in our pocket a phone.

2410
01:44:17,845 --> 01:44:19,811
And one of the things that phone does

2411
01:44:19,811 --> 01:44:23,105
for the most part is it is an attention shortening device

2412
01:44:23,105 --> 01:44:25,509
because most of the things we do on our phone

2413
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:27,645
shorten our attention spans.

2414
01:44:27,645 --> 01:44:30,701
And I'm not even gonna say we know for sure that that's bad,

2415
01:44:30,701 --> 01:44:31,959
but I do think it's happening.

2416
01:44:31,959 --> 01:44:34,890
That's one of the ways we're co-evolving with that tool.

2417
01:44:34,890 --> 01:44:37,299
But I think it's important to spend some of your time

2418
01:44:37,299 --> 01:44:41,702
and some of your life doing long attention span things.

2419
01:44:41,702 --> 01:44:45,066
- Yeah, I think you've spoken about the value

2420
01:44:45,066 --> 01:44:47,720
in your own life of focus,

2421
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:50,802
of singular focus on a thing for prolonged periods of time.

2422
01:44:50,802 --> 01:44:52,844
And that's certainly what books do

2423
01:44:52,844 --> 01:44:55,143
and that's certainly what that piece of technology does.

2424
01:44:55,143 --> 01:44:59,485
But I bring all that up to ask you about another piece

2425
01:44:59,485 --> 01:45:02,818
of technology, AI that has the potential

2426
01:45:03,804 --> 01:45:06,304
to have a various trajectories

2427
01:45:07,368 --> 01:45:10,445
to have an impact on human civilization.

2428
01:45:10,445 --> 01:45:13,362
How do you think AI will change us?

2429
01:45:14,282 --> 01:45:17,382
- You're talking about you know, generative AI,

2430
01:45:17,382 --> 01:45:20,047
large language models, things like ChatGPT

2431
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:22,047
and its soon successors,

2432
01:45:25,009 --> 01:45:28,926
and these are incredibly powerful technologies.

2433
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:34,048
To believe otherwise is to bury her head in the sand,

2434
01:45:34,048 --> 01:45:36,548
soon to be even more powerful.

2435
01:45:41,056 --> 01:45:46,024
It's interesting to me that that large language models

2436
01:45:46,024 --> 01:45:49,606
in their current form are not inventions,

2437
01:45:49,606 --> 01:45:51,273
they're discoveries.

2438
01:45:52,377 --> 01:45:55,524
You know, the telescope was an invention,

2439
01:45:55,524 --> 01:45:58,357
but looking through it at Jupiter,

2440
01:45:59,927 --> 01:46:03,629
knowing that it had moons was a discovery.

2441
01:46:03,629 --> 01:46:05,379
My God, it has moons.

2442
01:46:06,626 --> 01:46:09,145
And that's what Galileo did.

2443
01:46:09,145 --> 01:46:13,209
And so this is closer on that spectrum of invention.

2444
01:46:13,209 --> 01:46:17,063
You know, we know exactly what happens with a 787.

2445
01:46:17,063 --> 01:46:19,161
It's an engineered object.

2446
01:46:19,161 --> 01:46:22,026
We designed it, we know how it behaves.

2447
01:46:22,026 --> 01:46:24,970
We don't want any surprises.

2448
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:28,743
Large language models are much more like discoveries.

2449
01:46:28,743 --> 01:46:31,605
We're constantly getting surprised by their capabilities.

2450
01:46:31,605 --> 01:46:35,316
They're not really engineered objects.

2451
01:46:35,316 --> 01:46:38,233
Then you know, you have this debate

2452
01:46:39,587 --> 01:46:41,436
about whether they're gonna be good for humanity

2453
01:46:41,436 --> 01:46:43,103
or bad for humanity.

2454
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:49,078
You know, even specialized AI

2455
01:46:49,078 --> 01:46:51,144
could be very bad for humanity.

2456
01:46:51,144 --> 01:46:55,886
I mean, you know, just regular machine learning models

2457
01:46:55,886 --> 01:46:59,719
that can make you know, certain weapons of war

2458
01:47:00,810 --> 01:47:04,562
that could be incredibly destructive are very powerful.

2459
01:47:04,562 --> 01:47:07,045
And they're not general AIs, they're just,

2460
01:47:07,045 --> 01:47:10,212
they could just be very smart weapons.

2461
01:47:12,207 --> 01:47:16,374
And so we have to think about all of those things.

2462
01:47:17,494 --> 01:47:20,305
I'm very optimistic about this.

2463
01:47:20,305 --> 01:47:24,352
So even in the face of all this uncertainty,

2464
01:47:24,352 --> 01:47:27,685
my own view is that these powerful tools

2465
01:47:30,864 --> 01:47:35,105
are much more likely to help us and save us even

2466
01:47:35,105 --> 01:47:39,268
than they are to unbalance, hurt us, and destroy us.

2467
01:47:39,268 --> 01:47:42,582
I think you know, we humans have a lot of ways of,

2468
01:47:42,582 --> 01:47:44,707
we can make ourselves go extinct.

2469
01:47:44,707 --> 01:47:47,781
You know, these things may help us not do that.

2470
01:47:47,781 --> 01:47:50,965
You know, so they may actually save us.

2471
01:47:50,965 --> 01:47:54,523
So the people who are you know, overly concerned,

2472
01:47:54,523 --> 01:47:55,744
in my view, overly concerned.

2473
01:47:55,744 --> 01:47:57,411
It's a valid debate.

2474
01:47:58,588 --> 01:48:01,704
I think that they may be missing part of the equation,

2475
01:48:01,704 --> 01:48:03,765
which is how helpful they could be

2476
01:48:03,765 --> 01:48:07,525
in making sure we don't destroy ourselves.

2477
01:48:07,525 --> 01:48:11,247
I don't know if you saw the movie Oppenheimer,

2478
01:48:11,247 --> 01:48:15,302
but to me, first of all, I loved the movie

2479
01:48:15,302 --> 01:48:17,824
and I thought the best part of the movie

2480
01:48:17,824 --> 01:48:22,207
is this bureaucrat played by Robert Downey Jr.

2481
01:48:22,207 --> 01:48:24,384
who you know, some of the people I've talked to

2482
01:48:24,384 --> 01:48:26,022
think that's the most boring part of the movie.

2483
01:48:26,022 --> 01:48:28,165
I thought it was the most fascinating

2484
01:48:28,165 --> 01:48:31,066
because what's going on here

2485
01:48:31,066 --> 01:48:36,066
is you realize we have invented these awesome, destructive,

2486
01:48:36,432 --> 01:48:40,578
powerful technologies called nuclear weapons

2487
01:48:40,578 --> 01:48:44,578
and they're managed and you know, we humans are,

2488
01:48:47,528 --> 01:48:52,364
we're not really capable of wielding those weapons.

2489
01:48:52,364 --> 01:48:54,979
We're, you know, that's what he represented

2490
01:48:54,979 --> 01:48:58,260
in that movie is here's this guy

2491
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:03,010
who is just, he wrongly thinks, he's like being so petty.

2492
01:49:03,959 --> 01:49:05,643
He thinks that he said something,

2493
01:49:05,643 --> 01:49:08,122
that Oppenheimer said something bad to Einstein about him.

2494
01:49:08,122 --> 01:49:09,965
They didn't talk about him at all,

2495
01:49:09,965 --> 01:49:12,358
as you find out in the final scene of the movie.

2496
01:49:12,358 --> 01:49:16,441
And yet he spent his career trying to be vengeful

2497
01:49:17,529 --> 01:49:18,362
and petty.

2498
01:49:19,723 --> 01:49:21,209
And that's the problem.

2499
01:49:21,209 --> 01:49:25,459
We as a species are not really sophisticated enough

2500
01:49:29,504 --> 01:49:32,447
and mature enough to handle these technologies.

2501
01:49:32,447 --> 01:49:36,623
And so, and by the way, before you get to general AI

2502
01:49:36,623 --> 01:49:39,065
and the possibility of AI having agency

2503
01:49:39,065 --> 01:49:41,239
and there's a lot of things would have to happen,

2504
01:49:41,239 --> 01:49:44,365
but there's so much benefit that's gonna come

2505
01:49:44,365 --> 01:49:46,229
from these technologies in the meantime,

2506
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:49,459
even before they're, you know, general AI

2507
01:49:49,459 --> 01:49:51,872
in terms of better medicines

2508
01:49:51,872 --> 01:49:55,471
and better tools to develop more technologies, and so on.

2509
01:49:55,471 --> 01:49:59,871
I think it's an incredible moment to be alive

2510
01:49:59,871 --> 01:50:02,925
and to witness the transformations that are gonna happen.

2511
01:50:02,925 --> 01:50:04,910
How quickly will happen no one knows.

2512
01:50:04,910 --> 01:50:06,384
But over the next 10 years and 20 years,

2513
01:50:06,384 --> 01:50:10,285
I think we're gonna see really remarkable advances.

2514
01:50:10,285 --> 01:50:12,764
And I personally am very excited about it.

2515
01:50:12,764 --> 01:50:14,366
- First of all, really interesting to say

2516
01:50:14,366 --> 01:50:18,006
that it's discoveries that it's true

2517
01:50:18,006 --> 01:50:22,331
that we don't know the limits of what's possible

2518
01:50:22,331 --> 01:50:24,122
with the current language models.

2519
01:50:24,122 --> 01:50:24,955
- We don't.

2520
01:50:24,955 --> 01:50:27,724
- And like it could be a few tricks and hacks

2521
01:50:27,724 --> 01:50:31,131
here and there that that open doors

2522
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:33,349
to whole entire new possibilities.

2523
01:50:33,349 --> 01:50:37,500
- We do know that humans are doing something different

2524
01:50:37,500 --> 01:50:40,250
from these models in part because

2525
01:50:42,364 --> 01:50:44,605
you know, we're so power efficient.

2526
01:50:44,605 --> 01:50:48,169
You know, the human brain does remarkable things

2527
01:50:48,169 --> 01:50:51,965
and it does it on about 20 watts of power.

2528
01:50:51,965 --> 01:50:56,072
And you know, the AI techniques we use today

2529
01:50:56,072 --> 01:50:59,210
use many kilowatts of power to do equivalent tasks.

2530
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:00,650
So there's something interesting

2531
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:02,722
about the way the human brain does this

2532
01:51:02,722 --> 01:51:04,510
and also we don't need as much data.

2533
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:08,109
So, you know, like self-driving cars are,

2534
01:51:08,109 --> 01:51:11,429
they have to drive billions and billions of miles

2535
01:51:11,429 --> 01:51:13,484
to try to learn how to drive.

2536
01:51:13,484 --> 01:51:15,112
And you know, your average 16-year-old

2537
01:51:15,112 --> 01:51:18,195
figures it out with many fewer miles.

2538
01:51:19,983 --> 01:51:21,849
So there are still some tricks I think

2539
01:51:21,849 --> 01:51:23,928
that we have yet to learn.

2540
01:51:23,928 --> 01:51:26,429
I don't think we've learned the last trick.

2541
01:51:26,429 --> 01:51:30,268
I don't think it's just a question of scaling things up,

2542
01:51:30,268 --> 01:51:33,484
but what's interesting is that just scaling things up,

2543
01:51:33,484 --> 01:51:35,149
and I put just in quotes because it's actually hard

2544
01:51:35,149 --> 01:51:36,170
to scale things up,

2545
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:38,913
but just scaling things up also appears

2546
01:51:38,913 --> 01:51:40,445
to pay huge dividends.

2547
01:51:40,445 --> 01:51:43,467
- Yeah, and there's some more nuanced aspect

2548
01:51:43,467 --> 01:51:44,913
about human beings that's interesting.

2549
01:51:44,913 --> 01:51:48,947
If it's able to accomplish like being truly original

2550
01:51:48,947 --> 01:51:51,530
and novel to you know, large language models,

2551
01:51:51,530 --> 01:51:55,641
being able to come up with some truly new ideas.

2552
01:51:55,641 --> 01:51:56,474
That's one.

2553
01:51:56,474 --> 01:51:58,724
And the other one is truth.

2554
01:51:59,821 --> 01:52:02,811
It seems that large language models are very good

2555
01:52:02,811 --> 01:52:06,977
at sounding like they're saying a true thing,

2556
01:52:06,977 --> 01:52:10,977
but they don't require or often have a grounding

2557
01:52:11,832 --> 01:52:14,056
in sort of a mathematical truth.

2558
01:52:14,056 --> 01:52:17,173
It can just, it basically is a very good bullshitter.

2559
01:52:17,173 --> 01:52:19,414
So if there's not enough data,

2560
01:52:19,414 --> 01:52:22,212
if there's not enough sort of data

2561
01:52:22,212 --> 01:52:25,488
in the training data about a particular topic,

2562
01:52:25,488 --> 01:52:30,428
it's just going to concoct accurate sounding narratives,

2563
01:52:30,428 --> 01:52:35,133
which is a very fascinating problem to try to solve.

2564
01:52:35,133 --> 01:52:37,972
How do you get language models

2565
01:52:37,972 --> 01:52:41,891
to infer what is true and not to sort of introspect?

2566
01:52:41,891 --> 01:52:43,844
- Yeah, they need to be taught to say

2567
01:52:43,844 --> 01:52:46,035
I don't know more often.

2568
01:52:46,035 --> 01:52:47,156
- Yeah.

2569
01:52:47,156 --> 01:52:48,810
- And I know of several humans

2570
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:50,633
who could be taught that as well.

2571
01:52:50,633 --> 01:52:51,631
- Sure.

2572
01:52:51,631 --> 01:52:52,932
- And then the other stuff,

2573
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:55,476
because you're still a bit involved in the Amazon side

2574
01:52:55,476 --> 01:52:56,829
with the AI things,

2575
01:52:56,829 --> 01:52:59,428
the other open question is what kind of products

2576
01:52:59,428 --> 01:53:01,175
are created from this?

2577
01:53:01,175 --> 01:53:02,852
- Oh, so many.

2578
01:53:02,852 --> 01:53:03,685
- Yeah.

2579
01:53:03,685 --> 01:53:05,085
- I mean, you know, just to,

2580
01:53:05,085 --> 01:53:08,918
we have Alexa and Echo and Alexa has you know,

2581
01:53:10,463 --> 01:53:15,211
hundreds of millions of installed base, you know, inputs.

2582
01:53:15,211 --> 01:53:18,456
And so there's, you know, there's Alexa everywhere

2583
01:53:18,456 --> 01:53:20,755
and guess what Alexa is about to get a lot smarter.

2584
01:53:20,755 --> 01:53:21,628
- Yeah.

2585
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:24,156
- And so that's really you know,

2586
01:53:24,156 --> 01:53:27,132
from a product point of view, that's super exciting.

2587
01:53:27,132 --> 01:53:28,925
- There's so many opportunities there.

2588
01:53:28,925 --> 01:53:30,252
- So many opportunities.

2589
01:53:30,252 --> 01:53:32,092
Shopping assistant, you know,

2590
01:53:32,092 --> 01:53:33,613
like all that stuff is amazing.

2591
01:53:33,613 --> 01:53:36,515
And AWS you know, we're building Titan,

2592
01:53:36,515 --> 01:53:38,411
which is our foundational model.

2593
01:53:38,411 --> 01:53:40,972
We're also building Bedrock,

2594
01:53:40,972 --> 01:53:45,889
which our corporate clients at AWS, our enterprise clients,

2595
01:53:47,565 --> 01:53:49,594
they want to be able to use these powerful models

2596
01:53:49,594 --> 01:53:51,753
with their own corporate data

2597
01:53:51,753 --> 01:53:55,875
Without accidentally contributing their corporate data

2598
01:53:55,875 --> 01:53:57,123
to that model.

2599
01:53:57,123 --> 01:53:59,251
And so those are the tools we're building

2600
01:53:59,251 --> 01:54:00,252
for them with Bedrock.

2601
01:54:00,252 --> 01:54:02,834
So there's tremendous opportunity here.

2602
01:54:02,834 --> 01:54:04,289
- Yeah, the security, the privacy,

2603
01:54:04,289 --> 01:54:06,637
all those things are fascinating of how to,

2604
01:54:06,637 --> 01:54:08,234
'cause so much value can be gained

2605
01:54:08,234 --> 01:54:09,866
by training on private data

2606
01:54:09,866 --> 01:54:11,909
that you want to keep the secure.

2607
01:54:11,909 --> 01:54:13,753
It's a fascinating technical problem.

2608
01:54:13,753 --> 01:54:14,586
- Yes.

2609
01:54:14,586 --> 01:54:17,133
This is a very challenging technical problem

2610
01:54:17,133 --> 01:54:18,787
and it's one that we're you know, making progress on

2611
01:54:18,787 --> 01:54:20,890
and dedicated to solving for our customers.

2612
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:23,721
- Do you think there will be a day

2613
01:54:23,721 --> 01:54:25,425
when humans and robots maybe Alexa

2614
01:54:25,425 --> 01:54:27,390
have a romantic relationship?

2615
01:54:27,390 --> 01:54:29,170
Like in the movie Her.

2616
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:30,884
- Well, I mean, I think-

2617
01:54:30,884 --> 01:54:32,380
- I'm just brainstorming products here.

2618
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:35,866
- If you look at the spectrum of human variety

2619
01:54:35,866 --> 01:54:37,884
and what people like you know, sexual variety.

2620
01:54:37,884 --> 01:54:39,025
- Yes.

2621
01:54:39,025 --> 01:54:41,161
- You know, there are people who like everything.

2622
01:54:41,161 --> 01:54:43,056
So the answer to your question has to be yes.

2623
01:54:43,056 --> 01:54:43,889
- Okay.

2624
01:54:43,889 --> 01:54:45,050
- I don't know how-

2625
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:46,077
- I guess I'm asking when?

2626
01:54:46,077 --> 01:54:47,120
- I don't know how widespread that will be.

2627
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,123
- All right.

2628
01:54:48,123 --> 01:54:49,039
- But it will happen.

2629
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:53,991
- I was just asking when for a friend, but it's all right.

2630
01:54:53,991 --> 01:54:55,106
Moving on.

2631
01:54:55,106 --> 01:54:56,732
Next question.

2632
01:54:56,732 --> 01:55:01,526
What's a perfectly productive day in the life of Jeff Bezos?

2633
01:55:01,526 --> 01:55:04,507
You're one of the most productive humans in the world.

2634
01:55:04,507 --> 01:55:05,506
- Well, I first of all,

2635
01:55:05,506 --> 01:55:07,630
I get up in the morning and I putter.

2636
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:08,948
I like have a coffee.

2637
01:55:08,948 --> 01:55:11,108
- Can you define putter?

2638
01:55:11,108 --> 01:55:14,382
- Just like I slowly move around.

2639
01:55:14,382 --> 01:55:17,725
I'm not as productive as you might think I am.

2640
01:55:17,725 --> 01:55:19,507
I mean, 'cause I do believe in wandering

2641
01:55:19,507 --> 01:55:23,850
and I sort of I, you know, I read my phone for a while.

2642
01:55:23,850 --> 01:55:26,648
I read newspapers for a while.

2643
01:55:26,648 --> 01:55:30,868
I chat with Lauren, I drink my first coffee.

2644
01:55:30,868 --> 01:55:33,365
So I kind of, I move pretty slowly

2645
01:55:33,365 --> 01:55:35,227
in the first couple of hours.

2646
01:55:35,227 --> 01:55:37,883
I get up early just naturally.

2647
01:55:37,883 --> 01:55:41,216
And then, you know, I exercise most days

2648
01:55:42,669 --> 01:55:44,747
and most days it's not that hard for me.

2649
01:55:44,747 --> 01:55:47,389
Some days it's really hard and I do it anyway.

2650
01:55:47,389 --> 01:55:49,264
I don't want to you know, and it's painful.

2651
01:55:49,264 --> 01:55:51,935
And I'm like why am I here and I don't want to.

2652
01:55:51,935 --> 01:55:53,260
- Why am I here at the gym?

2653
01:55:53,260 --> 01:55:54,430
- Why am I here at the gym?

2654
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:56,683
Why don't I do something else?

2655
01:55:56,683 --> 01:55:59,161
You know, it's not always easy.

2656
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:02,404
- What's your social motivation in those moments?

2657
01:56:02,404 --> 01:56:05,727
- I know that I'll feel better later if I do it.

2658
01:56:05,727 --> 01:56:08,845
And so like the real source of motivation,

2659
01:56:08,845 --> 01:56:11,324
I can tell the days when I skip it,

2660
01:56:11,324 --> 01:56:12,798
I'm not quite as alert.

2661
01:56:12,798 --> 01:56:14,797
I don't feel as good.

2662
01:56:14,797 --> 01:56:17,417
And then there's harder motivations.

2663
01:56:17,417 --> 01:56:19,880
It's longer term, you want to be healthy as you age,

2664
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:23,855
you know, you want health span, you want, ideally,

2665
01:56:23,855 --> 01:56:26,157
you know, you want to be healthy and moving around

2666
01:56:26,157 --> 01:56:27,867
when you're 80 years old, you know,

2667
01:56:27,867 --> 01:56:29,870
and so there's a lot of,

2668
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:33,285
but that kind of motivation is so far in the future.

2669
01:56:33,285 --> 01:56:35,866
It can be very hard to work in the second.

2670
01:56:35,866 --> 01:56:38,348
So thinking about the fact I'll feel better

2671
01:56:38,348 --> 01:56:39,791
in about four hours if I do it now.

2672
01:56:39,791 --> 01:56:41,503
I'll have more energy for the rest of my day

2673
01:56:41,503 --> 01:56:42,702
and so on and so on.

2674
01:56:42,702 --> 01:56:44,345
- What's your exercise routine?

2675
01:56:44,345 --> 01:56:45,343
Just to linger on that.

2676
01:56:45,343 --> 01:56:46,542
How much do you curl?

2677
01:56:46,542 --> 01:56:49,790
I mean, what are we talking about here?

2678
01:56:49,790 --> 01:56:50,965
That's all I do at the gym.

2679
01:56:50,965 --> 01:56:51,798
So I just-

2680
01:56:51,798 --> 01:56:55,762
- My routine, you know, on a good day,

2681
01:56:55,762 --> 01:56:58,575
I do about half an hour of cardio

2682
01:56:58,575 --> 01:57:01,610
and I do about 45 minutes of weightlifting,

2683
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:04,598
resistance training of some kind, mostly weights.

2684
01:57:04,598 --> 01:57:08,250
I have a trainer who you know, I love

2685
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:11,474
who pushes me, which is really helpful.

2686
01:57:11,474 --> 01:57:13,395
You know, I'll be like,

2687
01:57:13,395 --> 01:57:17,093
he'll say Jeff, you think you could,

2688
01:57:17,093 --> 01:57:18,597
can we go up on that weight a little bit?

2689
01:57:18,597 --> 01:57:21,258
And I'll think about it?

2690
01:57:21,258 --> 01:57:23,557
And I'll be like no, I don't think so.

2691
01:57:23,557 --> 01:57:27,807
And he'll look at me and say yeah, I think you can.

2692
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:31,699
And of course he's right.

2693
01:57:31,699 --> 01:57:32,993
- Yeah, of course, of course.

2694
01:57:32,993 --> 01:57:34,941
- So it's cool to have somebody push you a little bit.

2695
01:57:34,941 --> 01:57:37,257
- But almost every day you do that?

2696
01:57:37,257 --> 01:57:40,659
- I do, almost every day. I do a little bit of cardio

2697
01:57:40,659 --> 01:57:42,563
and a little bit of weightlifting

2698
01:57:42,563 --> 01:57:44,336
and I rotate.

2699
01:57:44,336 --> 01:57:46,884
I do a pulling day and a pushing day and a leg day.

2700
01:57:46,884 --> 01:57:48,336
It's all pretty standard stuff.

2701
01:57:48,336 --> 01:57:49,842
- So puttering, coffee, gym.

2702
01:57:49,842 --> 01:57:52,864
- Puttering, coffee, gym, and then work.

2703
01:57:52,864 --> 01:57:53,697
- Work.

2704
01:57:53,697 --> 01:57:54,728
What's work look like?

2705
01:57:54,728 --> 01:57:58,352
What are the productive hours look like for you?

2706
01:57:58,352 --> 01:58:00,935
- I, you know, so a couple years ago

2707
01:58:00,935 --> 01:58:03,274
I left as the CEO of Amazon.

2708
01:58:03,274 --> 01:58:06,774
And I have never worked harder in my life.

2709
01:58:08,596 --> 01:58:11,825
I am working so hard and I'm mostly enjoying it.

2710
01:58:11,825 --> 01:58:14,443
But there are also some very painful days.

2711
01:58:14,443 --> 01:58:17,693
Most of my time is spent on Blue Origin

2712
01:58:18,855 --> 01:58:21,551
and I've been, I'm so deeply involved here now

2713
01:58:21,551 --> 01:58:23,192
for the last couple of years.

2714
01:58:23,192 --> 01:58:24,428
And in the big, I love it

2715
01:58:24,428 --> 01:58:26,419
and the small, there's all the frustrations

2716
01:58:26,419 --> 01:58:27,973
that come along with everything.

2717
01:58:27,973 --> 01:58:30,055
You know, we're trying to get to rate manufacturing

2718
01:58:30,055 --> 01:58:31,059
as we talked about.

2719
01:58:31,059 --> 01:58:32,813
That's super important.

2720
01:58:32,813 --> 01:58:33,709
We'll get there.

2721
01:58:33,709 --> 01:58:35,458
We just hired a new CEO,

2722
01:58:35,458 --> 01:58:37,390
a guy I've known for close to 15 years now,

2723
01:58:37,390 --> 01:58:39,138
a guy named Dave Limp, who I love.

2724
01:58:39,138 --> 01:58:40,159
He's amazing.

2725
01:58:40,159 --> 01:58:43,816
You know, so we're super lucky to have Dave

2726
01:58:43,816 --> 01:58:45,735
and you know, we're going to,

2727
01:58:45,735 --> 01:58:47,401
you're gonna see us move faster there.

2728
01:58:47,401 --> 01:58:51,334
But, so my day of work, you know, reading documents,

2729
01:58:51,334 --> 01:58:55,434
having meetings, sometimes in person, sometimes over Zoom,

2730
01:58:55,434 --> 01:58:56,837
depends on where I am.

2731
01:58:56,837 --> 01:58:59,919
It's all about you know, the technology.

2732
01:58:59,919 --> 01:59:01,138
It's about the organization.

2733
01:59:01,138 --> 01:59:03,638
It's about you know, I'm very,

2734
01:59:04,707 --> 01:59:08,778
I have architecture and technology meetings

2735
01:59:08,778 --> 01:59:13,456
almost every day on various subsystems inside the vehicle,

2736
01:59:13,456 --> 01:59:14,937
inside the engines.

2737
01:59:14,937 --> 01:59:16,475
It's super fun for me.

2738
01:59:16,475 --> 01:59:19,169
My favorite part of it is the technology.

2739
01:59:19,169 --> 01:59:21,752
My least favorite part of it is

2740
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:25,516
you know, building organizations and so on.

2741
01:59:25,516 --> 01:59:28,339
That's important, but it's also my least favorite part.

2742
01:59:28,339 --> 01:59:30,230
So, you know, that's why they call it work.

2743
01:59:30,230 --> 01:59:31,696
You don't always get to do what you wanna do.

2744
01:59:31,696 --> 01:59:34,581
- How do you achieve time where you can focus

2745
01:59:34,581 --> 01:59:36,277
and truly think through problems?

2746
01:59:36,277 --> 01:59:38,900
- I do little thinking retreats.

2747
01:59:38,900 --> 01:59:41,199
So for, this is not the only,

2748
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:42,696
I can do that all day long.

2749
01:59:42,696 --> 01:59:44,320
I'm very good at focusing.

2750
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,487
I'm very good at you know,

2751
01:59:47,706 --> 01:59:50,214
I don't keep to a strict schedule.

2752
01:59:50,214 --> 01:59:53,012
Like my meetings often go longer than I plan

2753
01:59:53,012 --> 01:59:55,715
for them to because I believe in wandering,

2754
01:59:55,715 --> 01:59:59,478
My perfect meeting starts with a crisp document.

2755
01:59:59,478 --> 02:00:02,480
So the document should be written with such clarity

2756
02:00:02,480 --> 02:00:04,958
that it's like angels singing from on high.

2757
02:00:04,958 --> 02:00:08,215
I like a crisp document and a messy meeting.

2758
02:00:08,215 --> 02:00:13,097
And so the meeting is about like asking questions

2759
02:00:13,097 --> 02:00:14,409
that nobody knows the answer to

2760
02:00:14,409 --> 02:00:18,492
and trying to like wander your way to a solution.

2761
02:00:20,417 --> 02:00:24,250
And because like when that happens just right,

2762
02:00:27,467 --> 02:00:29,499
it makes all the other meetings worthwhile.

2763
02:00:29,499 --> 02:00:30,545
It feels good.

2764
02:00:30,545 --> 02:00:32,028
It has a kind of beauty to it.

2765
02:00:32,028 --> 02:00:34,501
It has an aesthetic beauty to it.

2766
02:00:34,501 --> 02:00:37,233
And you get real breakthroughs in meetings like that.

2767
02:00:37,233 --> 02:00:39,708
- Can you actually describe the crisp document?

2768
02:00:39,708 --> 02:00:42,771
Like this is one of the legendary aspects of Amazon,

2769
02:00:42,771 --> 02:00:44,953
of the way you approach meetings?

2770
02:00:44,953 --> 02:00:47,734
Is this the six page memo?

2771
02:00:47,734 --> 02:00:50,151
Maybe first describe the process

2772
02:00:50,151 --> 02:00:51,495
of running a meeting with memos.

2773
02:00:51,495 --> 02:00:55,611
- Meetings at Amazon and at Blue Origin are unusual.

2774
02:00:55,611 --> 02:00:56,944
When we get new,

2775
02:00:57,794 --> 02:01:00,696
when new people come in, like a new executive joins,

2776
02:01:00,696 --> 02:01:02,868
they're a little taken aback sometimes

2777
02:01:02,868 --> 02:01:05,128
because a typical meeting,

2778
02:01:05,128 --> 02:01:09,050
we'll start with a six page narratively structured memo

2779
02:01:09,050 --> 02:01:10,800
and we do study hall.

2780
02:01:11,656 --> 02:01:14,936
For 30 minutes, we sit there silently together

2781
02:01:14,936 --> 02:01:16,875
in the meeting and read.

2782
02:01:16,875 --> 02:01:17,873
- I love this.

2783
02:01:17,873 --> 02:01:19,475
- Take notes in the margins.

2784
02:01:19,475 --> 02:01:21,142
And then we discuss.

2785
02:01:22,395 --> 02:01:25,788
And the reason, by the way we do study,

2786
02:01:25,788 --> 02:01:27,475
you could say I would like everybody to read these memos

2787
02:01:27,475 --> 02:01:31,503
in advance, but the problem is people don't have time

2788
02:01:31,503 --> 02:01:32,501
to do that.

2789
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:34,272
And they end up coming to the meeting

2790
02:01:34,272 --> 02:01:37,291
having only skimmed the memo or maybe not read it at all.

2791
02:01:37,291 --> 02:01:38,810
And they're trying to catch up.

2792
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:41,145
And they're also bluffing like they were in college

2793
02:01:41,145 --> 02:01:42,268
having pretended to do the reading.

2794
02:01:42,268 --> 02:01:43,101
- Yeah,

2795
02:01:43,101 --> 02:01:44,224
Exactly.

2796
02:01:44,224 --> 02:01:46,268
- It's better just to carve out the time for people

2797
02:01:46,268 --> 02:01:47,149
- And do it together.

2798
02:01:47,149 --> 02:01:48,551
- So now we're all on the same page.

2799
02:01:48,551 --> 02:01:50,234
We've all read the memo

2800
02:01:50,234 --> 02:01:53,327
and now we can have a really elevated discussion.

2801
02:01:53,327 --> 02:01:54,915
And this is so much better

2802
02:01:54,915 --> 02:01:57,736
from having a slideshow presentation, you know,

2803
02:01:57,736 --> 02:02:00,130
a PowerPoint presentation of some kind

2804
02:02:00,130 --> 02:02:02,713
where that has so many difficulties.

2805
02:02:02,713 --> 02:02:04,557
But one of the problems is PowerPoint

2806
02:02:04,557 --> 02:02:05,851
is really designed to persuade.

2807
02:02:05,851 --> 02:02:07,814
It's kind of a sales tool.

2808
02:02:07,814 --> 02:02:12,115
And internally the last thing you want to do is sell.

2809
02:02:12,115 --> 02:02:13,942
You want to, you're again, you're truth seeking.

2810
02:02:13,942 --> 02:02:15,987
You're trying to find truth.

2811
02:02:15,987 --> 02:02:17,722
And the other problem with PowerPoint

2812
02:02:17,722 --> 02:02:22,072
is it's easy for the author and hard for the audience.

2813
02:02:22,072 --> 02:02:24,114
And a memo is the opposite.

2814
02:02:24,114 --> 02:02:25,960
It's hard to write a six page memo.

2815
02:02:25,960 --> 02:02:28,804
A good six page memo might take two weeks to write.

2816
02:02:28,804 --> 02:02:30,798
You have to write it, you have to rewrite it,

2817
02:02:30,798 --> 02:02:33,068
you have to edit it, you have to talk to people about it.

2818
02:02:33,068 --> 02:02:35,048
They have to poke holes in it for you.

2819
02:02:35,048 --> 02:02:37,789
You write it again, it might take two weeks.

2820
02:02:37,789 --> 02:02:41,453
So the author, it's really a very difficult job,

2821
02:02:41,453 --> 02:02:45,337
but for the audience it's much better.

2822
02:02:45,337 --> 02:02:47,653
So you can read a half hour and you know,

2823
02:02:47,653 --> 02:02:50,672
there are little problems with PowerPoint presentations too.

2824
02:02:50,672 --> 02:02:52,590
You know, senior executives interrupt with questions

2825
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:54,393
halfway through the presentation.

2826
02:02:54,393 --> 02:02:56,430
That question's gonna be answered on the next slide,

2827
02:02:56,430 --> 02:02:58,031
but you never got there.

2828
02:02:58,031 --> 02:03:00,372
If you read the whole memo in advance,

2829
02:03:00,372 --> 02:03:01,904
you know, I often write lots of questions

2830
02:03:01,904 --> 02:03:05,370
that I have in the margins of these memos,

2831
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:06,812
and then I go cross them all out

2832
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:08,673
because by the time I get to the end of the memo,

2833
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:09,973
they've been answered.

2834
02:03:09,973 --> 02:03:11,993
That's why I save all that time.

2835
02:03:11,993 --> 02:03:13,529
You also get, you know,

2836
02:03:13,529 --> 02:03:15,516
if the person who's preparing the memo,

2837
02:03:15,516 --> 02:03:19,894
we talked earlier about you know, group think

2838
02:03:19,894 --> 02:03:22,971
and you know, the fact that I go last in meetings

2839
02:03:22,971 --> 02:03:26,216
and that you don't want you know, your ideas

2840
02:03:26,216 --> 02:03:29,792
to kind of pollute the meeting prematurely.

2841
02:03:29,792 --> 02:03:32,428
You know, the author of the memos

2842
02:03:32,428 --> 02:03:35,515
has kind of got to be very vulnerable.

2843
02:03:35,515 --> 02:03:37,711
They've gotta put all their thoughts out there.

2844
02:03:37,711 --> 02:03:39,527
And they've got to go first.

2845
02:03:39,527 --> 02:03:42,925
But that's great 'cause it makes 'em really good.

2846
02:03:42,925 --> 02:03:45,436
And so, and you get to see their real ideas

2847
02:03:45,436 --> 02:03:48,774
and you're not trampling on them accidentally in a big,

2848
02:03:48,774 --> 02:03:50,587
you know, PowerPoint presentation.

2849
02:03:50,587 --> 02:03:52,692
- What's that feel like when you've authored a thing

2850
02:03:52,692 --> 02:03:53,836
and then you're sitting there

2851
02:03:53,836 --> 02:03:55,174
and everybody's reading your thing,

2852
02:03:55,174 --> 02:03:56,094
you're like-

2853
02:03:56,094 --> 02:03:57,566
- I think it's mostly terrifying.

2854
02:03:57,566 --> 02:03:58,399
- Yeah.

2855
02:04:00,246 --> 02:04:02,210
Like maybe in a good way?

2856
02:04:02,210 --> 02:04:03,275
- I think it's-

2857
02:04:03,275 --> 02:04:04,511
- Like purifying.

2858
02:04:04,511 --> 02:04:08,209
- I think it's terrifying in a productive way.

2859
02:04:08,209 --> 02:04:09,042
- Yeah.

2860
02:04:09,042 --> 02:04:10,473
- But I think it's emotionally

2861
02:04:10,473 --> 02:04:13,114
a very nerve wracking experience.

2862
02:04:13,114 --> 02:04:16,795
- Is there a art science to the writing

2863
02:04:16,795 --> 02:04:20,005
of the six page memo or just writing in general to you?

2864
02:04:20,005 --> 02:04:23,897
- I mean, it's really got to be a real memo.

2865
02:04:23,897 --> 02:04:28,609
So it means you know, paragraphs have topic sentences,

2866
02:04:28,609 --> 02:04:30,167
like it's verbs and nouns.

2867
02:04:30,167 --> 02:04:31,986
You can't, that's the other problem with PowerPoints,

2868
02:04:31,986 --> 02:04:33,766
they're often just bullet points

2869
02:04:33,766 --> 02:04:36,874
and you can hide a lot of sloppy thinking

2870
02:04:36,874 --> 02:04:38,157
behind bullet points.

2871
02:04:38,157 --> 02:04:40,055
When you have to write in complete sentences

2872
02:04:40,055 --> 02:04:41,292
with narrative structure,

2873
02:04:41,292 --> 02:04:43,688
it's really hard to hide sloppy thinking.

2874
02:04:43,688 --> 02:04:48,392
So it does, it forces the author to be at their best.

2875
02:04:48,392 --> 02:04:50,391
And so you're getting somebody's,

2876
02:04:50,391 --> 02:04:53,291
they're getting somebody's really their best thinking.

2877
02:04:53,291 --> 02:04:55,645
And then you don't have to spend a lot of time

2878
02:04:55,645 --> 02:04:59,014
trying to tease that thinking out of the person.

2879
02:04:59,014 --> 02:05:00,825
And you've got it from the very beginning.

2880
02:05:00,825 --> 02:05:03,037
So it really saves you time in the long run.

2881
02:05:03,037 --> 02:05:06,349
- So that part is crisp and then the rest is messy,

2882
02:05:06,349 --> 02:05:07,182
crisp document.

2883
02:05:07,182 --> 02:05:09,614
- Yeah, so you don't wanna pretend

2884
02:05:09,614 --> 02:05:11,777
that the discussion should be crisp.

2885
02:05:11,777 --> 02:05:13,335
There's, you know, most meetings,

2886
02:05:13,335 --> 02:05:15,989
you're trying to solve a really hard problem.

2887
02:05:15,989 --> 02:05:17,471
There's a different kind of meeting,

2888
02:05:17,471 --> 02:05:19,024
which we call weekly business reviews

2889
02:05:19,024 --> 02:05:21,286
or business reviews that may be weekly or monthly

2890
02:05:21,286 --> 02:05:22,549
or daily, whatever they are.

2891
02:05:22,549 --> 02:05:24,492
But these business review meetings,

2892
02:05:24,492 --> 02:05:27,209
that's usually for incremental improvement.

2893
02:05:27,209 --> 02:05:28,811
And you're like looking at a series of metrics,

2894
02:05:28,811 --> 02:05:30,817
every time it's the same metrics.

2895
02:05:30,817 --> 02:05:32,718
Those meetings can be very efficient.

2896
02:05:32,718 --> 02:05:35,214
They can start on time and end on time.

2897
02:05:35,214 --> 02:05:37,292
- So we're about to run out of time,

2898
02:05:37,292 --> 02:05:41,959
which is a good time to ask about the 10,000 year clock.

2899
02:05:44,166 --> 02:05:48,150
That's what I'm known for, is the humor.

2900
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:48,983
Okay.

2901
02:05:49,909 --> 02:05:52,545
Can you explain what the 10,000 year clock is?

2902
02:05:52,545 --> 02:05:56,652
- 10,000 year clock is a physical clock of monumental scale.

2903
02:05:56,652 --> 02:05:58,090
It's about 500 feet tall.

2904
02:05:58,090 --> 02:06:00,710
It's inside a mountain in west Texas

2905
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:03,325
in a chamber that's about 12 feet in diameter

2906
02:06:03,325 --> 02:06:04,831
and 500 feet tall.

2907
02:06:04,831 --> 02:06:07,931
10,000 year clock is a idea conceived

2908
02:06:07,931 --> 02:06:10,271
by brilliant guy named Danny Hillis

2909
02:06:10,271 --> 02:06:12,021
way back in the '80s.

2910
02:06:13,464 --> 02:06:15,829
The idea is to build a clock as a symbol

2911
02:06:15,829 --> 02:06:17,681
for long-term thinking.

2912
02:06:17,681 --> 02:06:21,312
And you can kind of just very conceptually think

2913
02:06:21,312 --> 02:06:24,574
of the 10,000 year clock as it you know,

2914
02:06:24,574 --> 02:06:27,012
it ticks once a year.

2915
02:06:27,012 --> 02:06:31,035
It chimes once you know, every a hundred years.

2916
02:06:31,035 --> 02:06:33,850
And the cuckoo comes out once every a thousand years.

2917
02:06:33,850 --> 02:06:36,476
So it just sort of slows everything down.

2918
02:06:36,476 --> 02:06:40,453
And it's a completely mechanical clock.

2919
02:06:40,453 --> 02:06:43,574
It is designed to last 10,000 years

2920
02:06:43,574 --> 02:06:45,312
with no human intervention.

2921
02:06:45,312 --> 02:06:48,514
So the material choices and everything else.

2922
02:06:48,514 --> 02:06:51,692
It's in a remote location, both to protect it,

2923
02:06:51,692 --> 02:06:56,692
but also so that visitors have to kind of make a pilgrimage.

2924
02:06:57,152 --> 02:06:59,402
The idea is that over time,

2925
02:07:00,652 --> 02:07:02,753
this will take hundreds of years,

2926
02:07:02,753 --> 02:07:06,573
but over time it will take on the patina of age

2927
02:07:06,573 --> 02:07:11,055
and then it will become a symbol for long-term thinking

2928
02:07:11,055 --> 02:07:14,433
that will actually, hopefully get humans

2929
02:07:14,433 --> 02:07:17,266
to extend their thinking horizons.

2930
02:07:18,433 --> 02:07:22,933
And my view that's really important as we have become,

2931
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:26,711
as a species, as a civilization more powerful,

2932
02:07:26,711 --> 02:07:29,096
you know, we're really affecting the planet now.

2933
02:07:29,096 --> 02:07:30,567
We're really affecting each other.

2934
02:07:30,567 --> 02:07:32,972
We have weapons of mass destruction,

2935
02:07:32,972 --> 02:07:35,560
we have all kinds of things

2936
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:37,833
where we can really hurt ourselves.

2937
02:07:37,833 --> 02:07:40,933
And the problems we create can be so large.

2938
02:07:40,933 --> 02:07:43,909
You know, the unintended consequences

2939
02:07:43,909 --> 02:07:45,840
of some of our actions like climate change,

2940
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:47,703
putting carbon in the atmosphere is a perfect example.

2941
02:07:47,703 --> 02:07:49,127
That's an unintended consequence

2942
02:07:49,127 --> 02:07:52,323
of the industrial revolution that a lot of benefits from it.

2943
02:07:52,323 --> 02:07:55,107
But we've also got this side effect

2944
02:07:55,107 --> 02:07:56,676
that is very detrimental.

2945
02:07:56,676 --> 02:08:00,100
We need to be, we need to start training ourselves

2946
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:01,104
to think longer term.

2947
02:08:01,104 --> 02:08:02,300
Long-term thinking is a giant lever.

2948
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:05,162
You can literally solve problems

2949
02:08:05,162 --> 02:08:06,476
if you think long-term

2950
02:08:06,476 --> 02:08:09,063
that are impossible to solve if you think short term.

2951
02:08:09,063 --> 02:08:11,664
And we aren't really good at thinking long-term

2952
02:08:11,664 --> 02:08:13,215
as you know, it's not really,

2953
02:08:13,215 --> 02:08:18,215
we're kind of, you know, five years is a tough timeframe

2954
02:08:18,222 --> 02:08:21,222
for most institutions to think past.

2955
02:08:22,921 --> 02:08:25,120
And we probably need to stretch that to 10 years

2956
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:27,717
and 15 years and 20 years and 25 years.

2957
02:08:27,717 --> 02:08:29,816
And we do a better job for our children

2958
02:08:29,816 --> 02:08:32,364
or our grandchildren if we could stretch

2959
02:08:32,364 --> 02:08:34,536
those thinking horizons.

2960
02:08:34,536 --> 02:08:38,643
And so the clock is, in a way, it's an art project,

2961
02:08:38,643 --> 02:08:40,479
it's a symbol.

2962
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:44,270
And if it ever has any power to influence people

2963
02:08:44,270 --> 02:08:45,722
to think longer term,

2964
02:08:45,722 --> 02:08:47,521
that won't happen for hundreds of years.

2965
02:08:47,521 --> 02:08:50,122
But we have to, you know, we're gonna build it now

2966
02:08:50,122 --> 02:08:52,223
and let it accrue the patina of age.

2967
02:08:52,223 --> 02:08:53,680
- Do you think humans will be here

2968
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,139
when the clock runs out?

2969
02:08:55,139 --> 02:08:56,461
Here on earth?

2970
02:08:56,461 --> 02:08:57,544
- I think so.

2971
02:08:59,462 --> 02:09:01,955
But you know, the United States won't exist.

2972
02:09:01,955 --> 02:09:03,817
Like whole civilizations rise and fall.

2973
02:09:03,817 --> 02:09:05,817
10,000 years is so long.

2974
02:09:06,716 --> 02:09:10,143
Like no nation state has ever survived

2975
02:09:10,143 --> 02:09:12,760
for anywhere close to 10,000 years.

2976
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,561
- And the increasing rate of progress

2977
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:15,577
makes that even-

2978
02:09:15,577 --> 02:09:16,581
- Even less likely so.

2979
02:09:16,581 --> 02:09:18,071
Do I think humans will be here?

2980
02:09:18,071 --> 02:09:18,949
Yes.

2981
02:09:18,949 --> 02:09:21,439
What, you know, how will we have changed ourselves

2982
02:09:21,439 --> 02:09:23,239
and what will we be and so on and so on.

2983
02:09:23,239 --> 02:09:25,724
I don't know, but I think we'll be here.

2984
02:09:25,724 --> 02:09:28,620
- On that grand scale, a human life feels tiny.

2985
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:31,132
Do you ponder your own mortality?

2986
02:09:31,132 --> 02:09:32,499
Are you afraid of death?

2987
02:09:32,499 --> 02:09:36,380
- No, I'm you know, I used to be afraid of death.

2988
02:09:36,380 --> 02:09:37,213
I did.

2989
02:09:37,213 --> 02:09:40,625
I like I remember as a young person

2990
02:09:40,625 --> 02:09:44,292
being kind of like very scared of mortality,

2991
02:09:45,263 --> 02:09:47,881
like didn't want to think about it and so on.

2992
02:09:47,881 --> 02:09:51,673
And always had a big, and as I've gotten older, I'm 59 now.

2993
02:09:51,673 --> 02:09:55,216
As I've gotten older, somehow that fear

2994
02:09:55,216 --> 02:09:57,049
has sort of gone away.

2995
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:01,302
I don't, you know, I would like to stay alive

2996
02:10:01,302 --> 02:10:02,899
for as long as possible, but I'd like to be,

2997
02:10:02,899 --> 02:10:05,163
I'm really more focused on health span.

2998
02:10:05,163 --> 02:10:06,945
I want to be healthy.

2999
02:10:06,945 --> 02:10:08,321
I want that square wave.

3000
02:10:08,321 --> 02:10:09,783
I want to you know,

3001
02:10:09,783 --> 02:10:12,169
this I wanna be healthy, healthy, healthy, and then gone.

3002
02:10:12,169 --> 02:10:15,286
I don't want the long decay.

3003
02:10:15,286 --> 02:10:18,941
And I'm curious, I wanna see how things turn out.

3004
02:10:18,941 --> 02:10:21,080
You know, I'd like to be here.

3005
02:10:21,080 --> 02:10:23,425
I love my family and my close friends

3006
02:10:23,425 --> 02:10:24,418
and I want to,

3007
02:10:24,418 --> 02:10:25,521
I'm curious about them and I wanna see,

3008
02:10:25,521 --> 02:10:28,283
so I have a lot of reasons to stay around,

3009
02:10:28,283 --> 02:10:32,283
but it's mortality doesn't have have that effect

3010
02:10:34,478 --> 02:10:37,984
on me that it did you know, maybe when I was in my 20s.

3011
02:10:37,984 --> 02:10:41,061
- Well Jeff, thank you for creating Amazon,

3012
02:10:41,061 --> 02:10:43,441
one of the most incredible companies in history.

3013
02:10:43,441 --> 02:10:46,541
And thank you for trying your best to make humans

3014
02:10:46,541 --> 02:10:48,977
and multi-planetary species expanding out

3015
02:10:48,977 --> 02:10:51,908
into our solar system, maybe beyond,

3016
02:10:51,908 --> 02:10:53,919
to meet the aliens out there.

3017
02:10:53,919 --> 02:10:55,957
And thank you for talking today.

3018
02:10:55,957 --> 02:10:58,496
- Well, Lex, thank you for doing your part

3019
02:10:58,496 --> 02:11:00,763
to lengthen our attention spans.

3020
02:11:00,763 --> 02:11:02,930
Appreciate that very much.

3021
02:11:04,295 --> 02:11:07,119
- Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jeff Bezos.

3022

02:11:13,023 --> 02:11:15,084
from Jeff Bezos himself.

3026
02:11:15,084 --> 02:11:20,084
"Be stubborn on vision, but flexible on the details."

3027
