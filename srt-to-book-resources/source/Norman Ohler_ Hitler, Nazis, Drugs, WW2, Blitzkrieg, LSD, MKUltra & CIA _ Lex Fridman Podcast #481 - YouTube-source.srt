1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,019
- Hitler invited three young tank generals to his

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,039
office, and they had a plan, which was the plan to go through the Ardennes

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,820
Mountains. That was the victorious idea. So it's not the

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,800
drugs, actually, that idea to go through the Ardennes Mountains. If you, if you think

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,620
monocausal, you would say that's the reason. That idea was

6
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,580
genius, and Hitler immediately understood it, because before, the

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,520
plan was to attack in the north of Belgium, which is the same as World War

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,400
I. It becomes a stalemate, and they fight for months, and no one

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,290
really moves, and it's bloody, and nothing's happening. It's

10
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,440
bad. But that was the only plan that they had. That's why the high

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,220
command said, "No, we're not going to do it. It's stupid." But these three tank generals,

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,890
they said, "Look, if we go with the whole army through the Ardennes

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,480
Mountains," and like Hitler, "Eh, this is not possible. This is like a mountain range.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,660
How can the whole German army fit through this

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,760
eye of a needle," basically. And they said, "No, we can do it because

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,100
everyone misunderstands what tanks can do. Tanks are not

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,960
slow machines in the back that wait for the

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,020
action to happen, and then support this somehow. We're going to use tanks in

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,000
the front as race cars, basically. We're going to

20
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,740
overpower the enemy. We're going to be in France

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,760
before they know it. We are already behind them, but it would only

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,660
work if you would reach Sedan, the border city of France, within three

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,170
days and three nights, and that was only possible if you don't stop."

24
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,250
Suddenly, Ranke realized that his moment had come because

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,220
he had the recipe how people could stay awake for three days and three nights.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,940
Before that, he was kind of an outsider, like the freak with the drug idea. Suddenly, he became

27
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,280
...like- ..."Okay, tell us, how does it work?" And he gave lectures in front of

28
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,300
the officers, and he wrote a stimulant decree where a whole

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,200
army is prescribed a drug, in this case methamphetamine, how much should

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,180
be taken, and at what intervals. This became a very big thing.

31
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,340
And then Temmler had to deliver 35 million dosages

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,120
to the front lines. And then on May 10th, they took their

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,540
methamphetamine and they started the surprise attack through the Ardennes Mountains.

34
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,200
- The following is a conversation with Norman Ohler, author of

35
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,040
Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich. A book

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,600
that investigates what role psychoactive drugs, particularly

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,700
stimulants such as methamphetamine, played in the military

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,660
history of World War II. It is a book that two legendary

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,660
historians, Ian Kershaw and Antony Beevor, give very high

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,600
praise to. Ian Kershaw describes it as, "Very well

41
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,660
researched, serious piece of scholarship." And Antony Beevor

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,590
describes it as, "Remarkable work of research."

43
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,520
And it is indeed a remarkable work of research. Norman went

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,160
deep into the archives using primary sources to uncover

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,130
a perspective on Hitler and the Third Reich that has before this been

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,500
mostly ignored by historians. He also wrote

47
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,700
Tripped: Nazi Germany, the CIA, and the Dawn of the Psychedelic

48
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,750
Age. And he's now working on a new book with the

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,420
possible title of Stoned Sapiens, great

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,350
title, looking at the history of human civilization

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,080
through the lens of drugs. This is the Lex

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,820
Tell me the origin story of meth,

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,840
methamphetamine, and Pervitin, its brand name drug version, in

57
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,460
the context of Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. Let's start there.

58
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,960
- I think you're right to ask about the context because without the

59
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,940
context, it's not really understandable. So what was the

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,640
situation? In the 20s, the Nazi movement basically started, and it started in

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,660
Bavarian beer halls. So alcohol was the drug of

62
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,570
choice of the early Nazi movement. The only guy that didn't

63
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,220
drink was Hitler. He was a teetotaler, I guess you

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,000
say. So that was happening in Munich. So alcohol and

65
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,769
National Socialism are very closely connected. At the same

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,839
time, in the 20s, in Berlin, there was a completely different thing going

67
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,840
on. People were taking all kinds of drugs. This had

68
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,780
to do, actually, with the defeat of Germany in the First World War. I mean, the context

69
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,500
is a big context. The Versailles Treaty had the effect that the German economy

70
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,340
was not really able to recover after the end of World

71
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:45,260
War I. The Versailles Treaty was written basically by the Western

72
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,520
victorious powers. Germany had no say in the negotiations. And I'm

73
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,000
certainly not a German nationalist, not even a German

74
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,860
patriot, but even I would say that the Versailles Treaty

75
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,360
treated Germany somewhat unfairly. I mean, it laid all the blame on Germany. And,

76
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,820
I mean, a war is a very complex thing, and the First World War

77
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,920
to examine how it actually started is a very complex, you know,

78
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,760
story, and there's many factors to it. But the Versailles Treaty just said it was

79
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,940
Germany's fault, and then Germany had to do all these

80
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,260
payments to the allies. It couldn't create a new economy.

81
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,240
It couldn't have a new army. So it was — the economy really went down. Everything in Berlin

82
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,640
was cheap, and the people were also using

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,940
substances that were very cheap in huge quantities. So while in

84
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,620
Bavaria, they were drinking alcohol, and alcohol in the brain,

85
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,880
stimulates behavior, group behavior: us

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,780
against them. You can actually examine this. A neuroscientist

87
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:00,360
would know exactly how this works. While in Berlin, the drugs that were used

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,729
were morphine. There was cocaine, there was

89
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,539
mescaline, there was ether. So people were experimenting.

90
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:12,500
Everyone developed a different mindset. It was all... you know, you didn't

91
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,000
behave in a way

92
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,289
that some kind of authority would like you to behave in, because the authority had

93
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,239
just lost the First World War and there was no real authority

94
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,109
in Berlin. People were doing whatever they wanted to do, and they were intoxicating

95
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,039
themselves in the way they wanted to do it. So the population, in a way, if you

96
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:35,080
just look at Munich and Berlin, was growing apart. Like, there

97
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,960
were the alcohol people in Munich, the Nazis, and then there were these

98
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:46,349
weird, diverse, LGBTQ, whatever kind of scene in Berlin. Like,

99
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,130
actresses sniffing ether in the morning and then making crazy moves.

100
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:56,789
- Could you speak to the nature of the motivation of the drug use in Berlin at the

101
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,770
time? Was it rebellion? Was it a way to deal with the

102
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:08,940
difficult economic depression? Was it just the natural thing that young people do to

103
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,940
explore themselves, to understand the world, to develop their culture? Like, what do we

104
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,840
understand about drug use there?

105
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:20,260
- All of these factors come together. But it was the first time in modern history,

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,700
in Germany at least, that there was no emperor. Like, before

107
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,740
that, Kaiser Wilhelm, everything was very strict, you know? You

108
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,760
had to... you couldn't go crazy, you know, as a young person. You couldn't

109
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:36,679
be a young person. But now in the Weimar Republic in the '20s, you could.

110
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:39,880
No one stopped you, so people went crazy. That's what made

111
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,679
Berlin into the city that it still somehow is. And maybe

112
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,580
later we talk about contemporary Berlin. It kind of... it's

113
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:51,520
still has that vibe, you know? That's why people still come to Berlin. Drugs are

114
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:55,479
cheap, you can move however you want, there's no authority. So that created

115
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,400
a rift between the Nazis in Munich, and they always hated Berlin

116
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,419
and what was going on in Berlin. So, for example, Goebbels, the later

117
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,979
propaganda minister, he called the situation in Berlin the

118
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,960
hated asphalt reality of Berlin.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,960
He hated that. And when the Nazis then were able to take power in

120
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,480
1933, one of the first things they did

121
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,319
was to really prosecute people who were taking drugs,

122
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,200
because they wanted to, you know, bring everyone back into the fold.

123
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,360
And I think that's... You asked what was the reason for people taking

124
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,539
so many drugs. They were accessible, they were

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,360
cheap, but I think the most important thing is that

126
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,140
they let you find yourself maybe, or lose

127
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,558
yourself, you know? Also possible, you know?

128
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,520
- Can we also talk about that here, because

129
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,640
you have a connection to this place, Berlin, and this

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,439
part of the world. Can you just briefly speak to that so

131
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,000
we can contextualize even deeper the personal aspect

132
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,939
of this? Because you understand the music of the people,

133
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:05,920
the land, its history. There's something you can only really

134
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,200
understand if you've been there and you have taken it

135
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,220
in. And we'll return to this topic in multiple contexts, but in this

136
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,220
particular way, as one human being who writes about this place,

137
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,160
what's your own story?

138
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,220
- I grew up in West Germany, and this was during the World War. And

139
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,020
Berlin, the walled-in city, was always like a big

140
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:33,839
fascination. There was a wall, there was actually a wall in the city

141
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,640
preventing people to move into another part. And I was from the

142
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,439
West, fortunate enough to be from the free West, so I could

143
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,339
travel to Berlin and I could leave. I could look at it, and I always loved Berlin. I thought it

144
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,669
was a very vibey place. And then when the wall came down, I was still

145
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,569
in school but I immediately got into the car of my parents and drove there.

146
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,579
I wanted to see how it came down. And then Berlin really, in the

147
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:02,500
'90s, became a place that was very attractive to me and I

148
00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,439
moved there then in the '90s. I was first living in New York. I wrote my first

149
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,160
novel in New York, and I loved New York before Giuliani became

150
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,140
mayor. It was... He ruined the city. Before that,

151
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,020
it was not gentrified. Or let's say he introduced gentrification, and

152
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,579
gentrification is a big topic. I still lived in the

153
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,440
ungentrified New York City for like 300 bucks a month rent,

154
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,329
and everyone I knew was an artist.

155
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,770
- You loved the diversity of it?

156
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:32,790
- Yeah, I loved it. I wrote my first novel there. I took LSD for

157
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,310
the first time in Downtown Manhattan on a Saturday night.

158
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,190
- So you're kind of like a German Kerouac type character, but

159
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,770
moved a few decades forward.

160
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:45,490
- I wouldn't compare myself to another writer, but I think Kerouac is pretty cool.

161
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,300
But he's an amphetamine writer. "On the Road" was apparently

162
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,220
written in two weeks on amphetamines. And, but it's good. Amphetamines

163
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,180
are not bad per se. We can also talk about these so-called bad drugs,

164
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,480
you know, because basically they're neutral. But let's not lose the thread.

165
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,069
- Yes. Yes. New York, Berlin-

166
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:02,420
- Even though New York was-

167
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,810
- Yes.

168
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:06,620
- Oh, yeah. And then I was in New York. I was in a health food store, one of the first.

169
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,380
Like, there weren't health food stores back then a lot, but there was one on

170
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,339
First Avenue. And suddenly there was an announcement,

171
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,120
which was unusual in the health food store. I think it was called Prana, Prana

172
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
Foods. And the announcement was that Kurt Cobain had just shot himself.

173
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,280
It was like... and I had been actually, and still am, a

174
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,180
Nirvana fan. I've seen one of the last concerts of Nirvana in

175
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,060
New York City, and it was amazing. But he killed himself.

176
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,120
And the next day, I received a music cassette from a friend

177
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,020
of mine from Berlin with electronic music, and I realized that

178
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,760
there had been a paradigm shift, obviously. Rock music with the hero on

179
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
stage was dead. Now it was, you know, dance,

180
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:56,040
electronic music, which a lot of people today think it's kind of simplistic

181
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,780
music form, but it's actually a very highly intelligent music form. At least it was in

182
00:12:01,819 --> 00:12:05,099
the '90s. People were really experimenting with that music. That was the new

183
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,118
music. That was actually the reason I moved to Berlin. I really decided I'd leave

184
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,292
New York City. I'm going to move to Berlin. And then in

185
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,192
Berlin, to answer your question,

186
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,532
I fell in love with something that probably reminded me

187
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,852
of the '20s, even though I wasn't there in the '20s.

188
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:28,082
That really... The city was very open. The wall had just... was still, you know...

189
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:31,912
I mean, it's a few years later, but still, the wall, it felt like it just came down.

190
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:35,792
There was... Germany was... Berlin was not yet the capital of Germany. That was still in

191
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:38,252
Bonn. So Berlin was a very

192
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:46,122
cheap, and cultural, and crazy city, probably a bit like in the '20s, actually.

193
00:12:47,072 --> 00:12:50,732
And that's how I fell in love with it, and that's how I became interested in this electronic scene.

194
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:56,552
I mean, I visited many dance venues then, so-called clubs.

195
00:12:56,592 --> 00:12:59,552
- Yeah, it's one of the hubs in the world of electronic music.

196
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:03,532
- They claim that techno was kind of invented in Berlin, but it also comes

197
00:13:03,552 --> 00:13:09,732
from Detroit. So Detroit and Berlin are like the techno hubs, I would say.

198
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:13,632
- Yeah, electronic music is a soundtrack for some of the most interesting

199
00:13:13,672 --> 00:13:17,212
experiences this earth has ever created, right? Just it gets people

200
00:13:17,232 --> 00:13:21,172
together in some interesting ways. So it's not just the music itself,

201
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:23,772
it's the experiences that the music enables.

202
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:27,472
- Well, in Germany, we had a situation that the wall actually kept people

203
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:31,212
apart. People didn't know each other. But because the wall came down,

204
00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:37,912
people suddenly met in abandoned buildings in the center of Berlin, which had

205
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:41,832
been owned by the socialist state of East Germany. The most famous

206
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:44,772
club, Tresor... Tresor means, like,

207
00:13:44,872 --> 00:13:48,412
vault. It was the big vault with the big doors, so that's where

208
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,052
Tresor was, the club.

209
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:55,982
- It's so funny that the echo 100 years later, Berlin had all these

210
00:13:57,012 --> 00:14:00,992
left-wing partiers, young people using drugs, and then Munich with the

211
00:14:01,032 --> 00:14:04,952
beer, and then that's where Hitler came out. So is that what we're supposed to

212
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:08,712
imagine in the early days of the Nazi party when Hitler's giving the

213
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:12,452
speeches to just a handful of folks, they're all drunk?

214
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:16,412
- Well, it is a fact that the movement

215
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:19,892
came out of the Bürgerbräukeller. It's a certain

216
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:24,212
restaurant pub in Munich, and that was not only a

217
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:28,161
beer hall, that was also a political venue. And it was

218
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:31,832
a right-wing venue. It was for right-wing populists. People like

219
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:35,652
communists wouldn't use it, even though communists are in many ways quite similar to the right

220
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:41,172
wing, especially back then. But it was used by right-wingers, and

221
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:44,592
Hitler didn't mind because people who are drunk are more

222
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:48,732
susceptible to right-wing populism, I would claim now here,

223
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:52,772
and Hitler would agree. So he did not think it was bad that these people were a bit

224
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:56,692
drunk, or maybe even very drunk, because if you're drunk you also get aggressive

225
00:14:56,732 --> 00:14:59,912
against others. He could play with that, you know?

226
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:03,612
- So drunk, aggressive towards others, but drunk in a group.

227
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,442
- It constitutes the group also...

228
00:15:05,442 --> 00:15:08,832
...if everyone is on the same alcohol level. You can just go to Oktoberfest in

229
00:15:08,872 --> 00:15:12,842
Munich, which is not a political thing, but everyone, you know,

230
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:16,762
you can kind of sense how it originated. And actually, the first

231
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:17,832
time the Nazis tried to

232
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:22,342
grab power was the so-called Beer Hall Putsch. I mean, that's a historical

233
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:26,012
event. It took place in 1923, and it was

234
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:29,592
after a drunk night where they suddenly decided, "Now we're going to do

235
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,472
it." So they came out of the Bürgerbräukeller,

236
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,972
and they were all drunk except Hitler, and they just tried to

237
00:15:37,052 --> 00:15:40,912
overtake the Munich government, and they miserably failed because it was

238
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:44,932
just a stupid drunk idea. They were like, "Yeah, let's just do it."

239
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:48,772
And the Bavaria police, quite sober that day, they just, you know,

240
00:15:48,832 --> 00:15:52,672
shot them to the ground. Hitler was almost killed. He just jumped

241
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:56,762
behind his bodyguard. Göring, during the Beer Hall Putsch

242
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:59,592
was wounded in his stomach with a, I think, a

243
00:15:59,672 --> 00:16:03,442
gunshot. That's why he became a morphine addict. So this Beer Hall

244
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:07,992
Putsch in '23 had severe effects. Also, they were sentenced to prison,

245
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:11,492
and Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in prison.

246
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:15,452
- All these little events come together. It's so interesting that

247
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:17,712
for them it was just life,

248
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:22,161
but now we look back at these critical moments in history that

249
00:16:22,632 --> 00:16:26,332
turned the tides of human civilization, right? So Hitler could

250
00:16:26,372 --> 00:16:31,872
have died there, and these characters, Göring, that became larger than life—

251
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:35,072
that influenced the lives and the deaths and the suffering of

252
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:38,972
millions, all... First of all, it could have been stopped

253
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:42,852
then, and whatever that means

254
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:46,382
when you look back at history. But all those are just human beings

255
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:50,482
developing their ideas, growing, developing groups, developing

256
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:53,652
ideologies, and using drugs or drinking.

257
00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:57,152
- I mean, that's why I thought it's interesting, for example, to

258
00:16:57,192 --> 00:16:59,052
examine Hitler's drug use.

259
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:03,832
When I announced that to a historian while I was doing research,

260
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:05,252
he helped me a lot with methamphetamine and the army,

261
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:10,012
a proper medicine historian from the University of Ulm. And then I said,

262
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:13,512
"Now I'm interested in Hitler." He said, "No, don't. This is not interesting.

263
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:17,872
This is not serious... His, his... "This is not serious history."

264
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:22,172
But it's... You know, even Hitler was a person, you know? And if you

265
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:26,212
understand, for example, the substance abuse of a person, of course

266
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:30,052
you understand more about that person. And historians never had that idea

267
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,812
before. Kershaw, for example, who is really a great... He's

268
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:37,392
very knowledgeable about National Socialism. Like many British

269
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:41,331
historians, they always know more about German history than the German

270
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:44,962
historians, but Kershaw really does. I think he's, he's really

271
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:50,132
good. But in his biography of Hitler, he just writes one sentence like,

272
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:55,772
"And then he had a crazy doctor called Morell who gave him dubious

273
00:17:55,852 --> 00:17:59,812
medications and drugs," and he stops there, and then he goes on to

274
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,152
describe whatever.

275
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:02,572
- Yeah, we should say that Ian Kershaw is

276
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:07,232
widely considered to be probably one of the greatest biographers of Hitler.

277
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,992
- I think he wrote the best biography of Hitler.

278
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:14,782
- Which is so important. Your work is really important because it opens

279
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:22,992
a whole new perspective on the lives of the individuals and the machinery of the

280
00:18:23,091 --> 00:18:26,812
Nazi military that historians haven't looked at. It's so

281
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:30,681
interesting that you can unlock those perspectives. And that's the

282
00:18:30,681 --> 00:18:34,611
underlying really, the foundation of our conversation today

283
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:38,492
and of your work, is there are layers to this thing. You can look at

284
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,441
the tactics of war and the

285
00:18:42,611 --> 00:18:46,492
strategic level of war, the operational level of war. You could look at the human

286
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:50,312
suffering of war, the love stories. You could look at the hate, the

287
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:53,611
psychology of propaganda, or you could look at the individual

288
00:18:53,712 --> 00:18:57,651
things, substances consumed by the individuals that make up

289
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:01,431
the Nazi Party leadership and the soldiers. And all those are

290
00:19:01,532 --> 00:19:04,841
critically important to understand the war, right? And this

291
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:11,052
piece of drug use and supplement use have been ignored by historians.

292
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:14,931
- That was very surprising to me, you know. I didn't know this myself.

293
00:19:15,012 --> 00:19:20,752
I never planned to write this book. It kind of happened to me. And

294
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:27,472
I decided to team up with the leading German historian on National

295
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:31,472
Socialism, Hans Mommsen, who

296
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:35,472
has passed away by now. He was quite old, but quite ready

297
00:19:35,532 --> 00:19:39,891
to be my mentor for this book, "Blitzed." And he

298
00:19:42,312 --> 00:19:48,292
was maybe even shocked when I came back from the military

299
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,512
archive of Germany with a lot of copies, all relating to

300
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:59,411
the systematic drug use of the German army, including

301
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:04,351
an experiment done by the Navy, who had always pretended

302
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:08,312
to be the clean, in German we say Waffengattung, weapon.

303
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,171
Like you have the Army, you have the Air Force, you have the Navy,

304
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:16,732
you have... And in Germany they had the SS. And the Navy always pretended to

305
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:20,431
be like, "We weren't really Nazis. We were like,"

306
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:23,871
you know, the German Navy. We had our ethics code."

307
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:27,712
But I found in the archive that the Navy

308
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,891
did human experiments in the concentration camp of

309
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:34,900
Sachsenhausen, trying to find a new wonder drug, because

310
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:38,611
they had new, what they called "wonder weapons" or what Hitler called "wonder weapons."

311
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:42,512
He always talked about these wonder weapons. Wonder weapons were basically mini submarines.

312
00:20:42,552 --> 00:20:46,322
One or two people would go in, staying underwater for up to a week and

313
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:50,151
torpedoing, you know, Allied ships. So the

314
00:20:50,252 --> 00:20:54,111
Navy was trying to develop a drug that would keep you

315
00:20:54,192 --> 00:20:57,512
awake and combat-ready for seven days and seven

316
00:20:57,572 --> 00:21:01,472
nights without sleep and without, you know, burning out.

317
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:05,022
Very difficult to find. So they hired a

318
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:08,891
penalty unit in the concentration camp. They hired...

319
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:12,851
The SS had a so-called "shoe-walking unit." It was a penalty

320
00:21:12,931 --> 00:21:16,692
unit within the concentration camp, testing shoe soles for the

321
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:20,351
German shoe industry, walking for days. And then they would

322
00:21:20,431 --> 00:21:24,091
measure how the soles, you know, kept up in the

323
00:21:24,212 --> 00:21:27,831
stress. And they had different layers in the

324
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:31,772
concentration camp, like all the surfaces the German

325
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:35,562
soldiers would touch when they conquered Europe. So this is a

326
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:39,072
very elaborate thing. If you go to the concentration camp today, it's a

327
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:43,052
museum. You can still see that running track of the shoe runners

328
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:46,692
unit. So the Navy hired the shoe runners unit from the

329
00:21:46,831 --> 00:21:50,712
SS, paid them money, and then gave them different kinds of drug

330
00:21:50,752 --> 00:21:54,611
combinations, methamphetamine combined with cocaine

331
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:58,002
and, you know, chewing gum and all kinds of things. So this is

332
00:21:58,091 --> 00:22:01,552
a big thing. And there's

333
00:22:01,591 --> 00:22:05,532
documents to it. And Mommsen, who knew everything about National Socialism,

334
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:09,512
the old, you know, authority. And I'm

335
00:22:09,532 --> 00:22:12,871
like the young... I didn't study history. I just, you know, I just

336
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,812
try to make sense, you know. But I present him all these documents.

337
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:21,772
He's reading like from this Pill Patrol and he said, "Wow."

338
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:25,012
He said, "We historians, we never do drugs. We don't understand

339
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:28,972
drugs. This, we missed this." So he was very clear

340
00:22:29,052 --> 00:22:32,222
that we missed this. And he said this is actually the missing

341
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:39,901
link that historians did not have, especially to explain Hitler's degeneration as a

342
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:46,672
leader. He made very good decisions, good in meaning militarily effective

343
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:50,610
decisions in the beginning of the war, and very bad decisions

344
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:54,631
for the German war effort towards the end. And you can link that

345
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:58,611
to drugs. You can explain a lot of Hitler through the drugs,

346
00:22:58,672 --> 00:23:03,292
but you can also look at this point that historians so far had not been able

347
00:23:04,492 --> 00:23:08,442
to figure out basically. What happened to Hitler? Why did he get crazy?

348
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:12,012
He was crazy, but why did he get so bad as a

349
00:23:12,072 --> 00:23:15,931
leader? Because he was very effective for a long time, and then

350
00:23:15,971 --> 00:23:17,591
there's this moment where it turns.

351
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:20,371
- Yeah, the degeneration of decision-making.

352
00:23:21,312 --> 00:23:25,212
Psychology, behavior, all of that. You cannot understand

353
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:29,192
that fully without understanding his drug use. And we should also

354
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:35,931
say that some of the historians you mentioned, Ian Kershaw and Anthony Beevor,

355
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:39,942
these legends of history, they all gave you compliments. So,

356
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:43,812
Kershaw said that, "Your work is very good, extremely interesting, and a serious

357
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:47,492
piece of well-researched history." Anthony Beevor said that it's a

358
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:51,312
remarkable work of research. So, props to them. You have

359
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:55,002
received a bunch of criticism from historians, but you've

360
00:23:55,111 --> 00:24:00,302
also received, obviously, a lot of props. I mean, Kershaw's,

361
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:05,572
the legendary historian of Hitler, complimenting how deep your work is.

362
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:09,532
That must feel good.

363
00:24:09,631 --> 00:24:13,532
Maybe this is a good moment to also, since we're talking about historians, to

364
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:21,276
address some of the criticism. So, Richard Evans was also a great historian, has

365
00:24:21,316 --> 00:24:25,136
been one of the bigger critics. He said that your work is crass and dangerously

366
00:24:25,236 --> 00:24:28,816
inaccurate, and is morally and politically

367
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:33,416
dangerous. I think that's grounded in the idea that

368
00:24:34,396 --> 00:24:38,166
if you say that, "Well, all the Nazi forces and

369
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:42,276
Hitler were on drugs, so therefore their evil can be... They're not really

370
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:48,166
evil. It's just accountability can be removed because they were using drugs."

371
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:48,956
- Right.

372
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:52,876
- And also another criticism of his, which I also

373
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:55,096
understand and probably can steelman, is

374
00:24:56,316 --> 00:25:02,256
if you look too much through the singular lens of drugs, you can

375
00:25:03,596 --> 00:25:06,925
overemphasize it. You know, you can overemphasize how

376
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:12,215
important it was as an explainer of the effectiveness of Blitzkrieg, for example.

377
00:25:13,116 --> 00:25:17,056
Because there is some... I mean, I should say there

378
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:20,936
is something really compelling about a singular theory that explains

379
00:25:20,946 --> 00:25:24,696
everything, and you can fall in love with it too much as an

380
00:25:24,716 --> 00:25:28,696
explainer. So, can you steelman his criticism

381
00:25:28,756 --> 00:25:32,066
or a criticism you received, and also argue against it?

382
00:25:32,176 --> 00:25:36,136
- I think he's absolutely right that you shouldn't argue in a monacausal

383
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,536
way. And this is actually what Mommsen also said to me,

384
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,016
because, of course, I was enthusiastic about all my drug

385
00:25:43,116 --> 00:25:50,206
findings. And he said, "Don't argue in a monacausal way, especially the war."

386
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:53,336
- There's a lot of variables, a lot of factors, a lot of things going on.

387
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:53,776
- Yeah.

388
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:57,816
So that sentence of his, "Don't argue in a monacausal way," that always stayed with

389
00:25:57,876 --> 00:26:07,156
me. And I think that, I didn't deviate from that path

390
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:12,126
actually. But it was still interesting that Evans thought that

391
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:16,996
I put too much emphasis on the drugs. I think it's a

392
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:21,046
totally fine, you know, opinion. I would disagree. Otherwise, I wouldn't have written

393
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:24,676
the book. What I can state here is that I

394
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:28,456
invented nothing. In all of my three non-fiction books,

395
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:32,356
nothing is invented. If you are a good writer, and I

396
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:36,146
trained as a novelist, for me, it was also very unusual to write a non-fiction book.

397
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:40,116
I wanted to write a novel about Nazis and drugs. My publisher said, "No, this

398
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:43,996
is..." And he looked at the, you know, at the facts. He said, "Someone

399
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:47,856
has to write the facts." So I said, "But non-fiction books are

400
00:26:47,896 --> 00:26:51,556
boring." He said, "Not necessarily. Maybe you can find a way to write it

401
00:26:52,176 --> 00:27:01,156
with your novelistic style, but based 100% on the facts." And that is like... In

402
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:05,136
German we say "Spagat." How do you say that? A split, like when you do

403
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,996
with your legs, like... It's hard, you know?

404
00:27:09,016 --> 00:27:12,335
Because with a very fluent, sophisticated

405
00:27:12,476 --> 00:27:15,776
language, you can easily overpower the reader.

406
00:27:16,516 --> 00:27:20,296
If I describe how the German guys, 19-year-old guys

407
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:24,156
took the meth and went into the tank, and the meth

408
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:29,756
started kicking in, five guys on meth after like one hour of ride into France,

409
00:27:30,956 --> 00:27:34,136
you can write that in a powerful way that if you are the reader, you would

410
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:38,156
think, "Yeah. I mean, the Blitzkrieg without meth is unthinkable."

411
00:27:38,196 --> 00:27:42,096
- There is a bit of a... Man, I wish I found that kind of feeling

412
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:45,786
for historians, right? Like, "How did I miss this piece?"

413
00:27:45,836 --> 00:27:49,546
So some historians, like great historians like

414
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,946
Kershaw, obviously, see, they kind of give you a,

415
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:56,976
like a slow clap, applaud. And some historians are a little bit

416
00:27:57,096 --> 00:28:02,226
skeptical, like, "This is a little too good." So totally understandable. And...

417
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:04,016
- Also, they have different

418
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:13,096
techniques to write texts like this. I used a totally different technique. And

419
00:28:13,556 --> 00:28:17,496
I have an apparatus, so it really feels like it could be

420
00:28:17,556 --> 00:28:21,156
an academic work. But still, it's written in a way

421
00:28:21,256 --> 00:28:25,176
that it kind of overpowers. It, it kind of colonializes

422
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:29,416
the story in a weird way. I never thought about it like that.

423
00:28:29,436 --> 00:28:33,216
But while I was writing it, I was just trying to write it as well as I could. I didn't

424
00:28:33,236 --> 00:28:35,896
think about these questions we're talking about now.

425
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:43,176
I just... I got carried away, obviously, but I never left the area of facts.

426
00:28:43,226 --> 00:28:47,076
- Yes. So we should talk about your process. That's also super fascinating. You went to the

427
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:50,896
archives. You went to the sources. What's that take? What does it

428
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:53,836
feel? What does it smell like? What does it look like? What does it

429
00:28:53,896 --> 00:29:01,286
entail? How much text is there? What language is it in? What's the process there?

430
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:05,196
- I never thought of going to the archives. And my girlfriend at the time, she said, "You have to go to the

431
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:09,026
archives." And she's an academic. So she... And I was like, "Yeah, okay. I'll

432
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:19,196
go." "I'm fine. I'll check it out." And then when I met a historian, he claims that

433
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:23,876
without methamphetamine, there would be no Blitzkrieg, no victory of Germany. Like he's

434
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:29,916
mono-causal. But he was also extremely helpful to me, and he's an academic.

435
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:32,956
He, he, he gave me the signatures, it's called in

436
00:29:32,996 --> 00:29:37,996
German, where you find stuff in the archives. Signature is like... Then it says like

437
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:44,976
H2/538, something like this. And these were the files of Professor

438
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:50,556
Ranke. And Professor Ranke was... He was the head of the

439
00:29:50,676 --> 00:29:58,576
Institute for Army Physiology. His job was to improve the performance of the soldier.

440
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:02,606
of the soldier. And all of his stuff was

441
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:07,916
filed in a certain place in the military archives, which in Germany

442
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:11,316
is in Freiburg, in the south, in a small town, not in Berlin. Because Germany is a

443
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:15,936
bit of a decentralized country. We don't want to put everything into

444
00:30:15,976 --> 00:30:18,776
Berlin again like the Nazis did. We try to avoid our

445
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:22,156
mistakes. So the military archive is in Freiburg, and I went

446
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:26,168
there. And because I had this signature,

447
00:30:26,947 --> 00:30:30,528
immediately I got original documents that were all

448
00:30:30,568 --> 00:30:34,668
relating to my research. I had the original.

449
00:30:34,678 --> 00:30:36,247
- What does it look like? Is it sheets of paper?

450
00:30:36,507 --> 00:30:37,408
- Yeah, it's like-

451
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:39,348
- Like, it's not scanned, it's-

452
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:43,168
- Well, it's different things. The guy who did the meth into the

453
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:50,608
army, Professor Ranke. He was writing a war diary. That's what

454
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:54,648
the name was, War Diaries. So every day he would write it by hand.

455
00:30:54,668 --> 00:30:56,147
So this war diary was given to me.

456
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,487
- So you're reading that? So it's like dated? You have a date-

457
00:30:59,568 --> 00:30:59,727
- Yeah

458
00:30:59,747 --> 00:31:00,648
- ... the diary?

459
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:02,447
- It was a bit funny with him because

460
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:07,528
he took a lot of meth himself because he thought it was great.

461
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:10,608
He just thought it increases your performance.

462
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:15,467
By now, we know a little bit more that methamphetamine is not so healthy.

463
00:31:15,528 --> 00:31:19,207
Because you get used to it and you burn out, you get depressed, then you take more.

464
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:23,768
Big problem. And he became depressed and burnt out, and he didn't realize it's

465
00:31:23,788 --> 00:31:27,467
because of the meth that he's describing to the whole German

466
00:31:27,568 --> 00:31:31,268
army. He made a convincing case. I can explain that in

467
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:36,007
detail how that actually happened. But just to have his war diary was great, and then

468
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:41,578
he would also type letters writing to the

469
00:31:42,207 --> 00:31:46,098
Company of Temmler, how fast they could produce stuff

470
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:49,997
in which time. So you have all these original documents. You have like

471
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:54,028
500 documents and he writes reports, like, what happened in

472
00:31:54,108 --> 00:31:57,648
this battle on methamphetamine. There's a lot of stuff you can

473
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:06,148
find in the archives if you find them. But, the tricky thing is that you can

474
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:09,908
only look. You kind of look at a so-called find

475
00:32:09,947 --> 00:32:13,247
book. In the find book you cannot type in

476
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:17,268
"drugs." It wouldn't find anything because at the time when they were

477
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:21,788
taking all the notes from this doctor, his war diary,

478
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:25,548
everything, they didn't put the label "drugs" there. They put the label his

479
00:32:25,628 --> 00:32:29,048
name, his position, World War II, French

480
00:32:29,128 --> 00:32:33,007
campaign, stuff like that. Because at the time they didn't

481
00:32:33,048 --> 00:32:36,888
know that I would at one point come and look for drugs in that. But he

482
00:32:36,947 --> 00:32:40,447
was the drug guy, but also they didn't realize he was the drug guy.

483
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:44,398
No one realized that he was the drug guy. So it's not easy to find stuff in

484
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:47,967
the archives. The archives you go to, it's a very Kafkaesque experience.

485
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,808
You go into this building, and you have to understand the rules and you will

486
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:55,788
never fully understand what's going on. Also, the archivists, they don't really know

487
00:32:56,227 --> 00:33:00,108
what's going on because there are so many documents. No one's read them all, you know?

488
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:05,768
No one knows. History is just kind of lying there, somehow organized, somehow stored.

489
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:07,928
- I mean, it does sound like a very Kafkaesque-

490
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:08,318
- It's-

491
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:09,027
- ... thing.

492
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:12,987
- But it's great if you find something, but you can also sit there for a week

493
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:14,888
and not find anything.

494
00:33:14,908 --> 00:33:17,467
- So what was the process for you? You're just reading,

495
00:33:17,987 --> 00:33:26,928
open-minded, trying to see if there's some truth here to be discovered?

496
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:30,716
- Well, I have a friend. He's a DJ, and we talked about Berlin.

497
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:38,798
We'll probably talk about it more, and he takes a lot of drugs and he knows his

498
00:33:38,848 --> 00:33:42,088
Let's put it that way, he knows his drugs.

499
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:47,118
And one day he said to me when I was trying to figure out what I would

500
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:51,068
write about next, he said, "The Nazis took a lot of drugs. You should write about that." And I said, "The Nazis

501
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,748
didn't take drugs," because, you know, when you grow up in Germany, you get

502
00:33:56,328 --> 00:34:00,128
educated about the Nazis quite intensely, especially

503
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:04,118
in West Germany. They teach you everything, but they don't teach

504
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:07,987
you drugs. Now they do, maybe, you know. But it was not

505
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:11,987
known, so the Nazis always had this aura of being law and order.

506
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:15,918
No drugs, of course. No chaos. Everything...

507
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:19,908
My grandfather, he was a Nazi, always said, "Well, at least there was discipline

508
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:23,768
in the country. There was law and order." So this doesn't match with drugs, you

509
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:24,208
know?

510
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,908
- You know, I should also say I think that's the experience for a lot of people. Before reading your

511
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:35,708
book, I had the same kind of feeling, that the Nazi ideology was all about

512
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:39,667
law and order and purity, and surely they would not be doing

513
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:43,667
drugs. So this really blew my mind. I

514
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:47,587
think I wasn't quite ready, similar to Richard Evans. This is a

515
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:51,547
big, like, okay, a narrative transforming

516
00:34:51,587 --> 00:34:55,138
into a deeper, more complicated understanding what

517
00:34:55,208 --> 00:35:00,388
Nazi forces and the Hitler inner circle actually looked like.

518
00:35:00,448 --> 00:35:03,048
- That's why I didn't believe Alex.

519
00:35:03,127 --> 00:35:07,567
- Always take the DJ, the drug expert, with a grain of salt.

520
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:11,498
- I didn't believe him, but I said, "It's a great topic. Maybe I could invent it." He said, "No, we don't

521
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:15,138
invent this. This is real." And I said, "How do you know?" And he said,

522
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:19,048
"I have a friend." And I know this guy by now. I met him. He's an antique

523
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:23,038
dealer in Berlin, and he had bought an old medicine chest in

524
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:26,768
an old Berlin apartment. This was in 2010. And he

525
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,817
found Pervitin tablets inside, which were the

526
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:34,408
methamphetamine product that was marketed in Germany in the late

527
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:38,148
'30s. And this guy, the antique dealer, took

528
00:35:38,208 --> 00:35:40,448
some tablets and they were quite old, you know,

529
00:35:41,388 --> 00:35:45,698
70 years old, but they still had an effect on him. I later asked him,

530
00:35:46,528 --> 00:35:50,417
and he said, "Well, we took them for about a month. It was the greatest

531
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:54,798
month we ever had. We had so much fun. We were so productive."

532
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:56,968
'Cause that methamphetamine back then was also

533
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:03,538
a quality product. It was not crystal meth made in a trailer lab, you know?

534
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:05,308
- So this is many decades later.

535
00:36:05,328 --> 00:36:06,408
- They were still potent.

536
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,468
- They were still potent.

537
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:11,048
- Especially, Alex convinced me because Alex has a high tolerance and he said,

538
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:14,067
"Okay, they still had some." So I said to him, "Can I have some

539
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:17,988
also?" I took one and he's like, "And this was... We were

540
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,468
standing in my writing tower, which is at the river in Berlin, and he was like, 'I took

541
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:25,348
one, and I could feel something. Then I took another

542
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:29,364
one,' and then it's, you know, 'I could feel more.' And then I

543
00:36:29,404 --> 00:36:33,304
took a third one. Typical Alex, he would take three, you know.

544
00:36:33,314 --> 00:36:37,104
Instead of just taking one, he took three methamphetamine tablets from the 40s. And he

545
00:36:37,164 --> 00:36:40,803
said, "And then I felt like..." And he looked at the river.

546
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:44,794
There was a big cargo ship going by, and he

547
00:36:44,884 --> 00:36:48,364
said, "I felt like this ship." Suddenly there was this "Shoop" he said in German, like

548
00:36:48,444 --> 00:36:52,384
a motion that was like energy that was grabbing me,

549
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:56,394
and I felt so powerful. And he told me this,

550
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:59,184
and I was like, "Wow!" This is like... And I Googled,

551
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:03,124
"Methamphetamine, Nazi Germany." This was in 2010. And there was this one

552
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:06,344
professor at the University in Ulm who said,

553
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:11,364
"The Blitzkrieg was only possible because of methamphetamine." So I called up this guy and he

554
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:14,844
said, "Sure, I'll meet you." And then he gave me the signature for the archive.

555
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:18,884
Then I went to the archive, and then I really started to do my own research.

556
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,814
Then I went to different archives, and I tried to find everything on Nazis

557
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:26,124
and drugs. And that came... Everything is in the book.

558
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:29,624
So that crazy meeting with Alex in my writing

559
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:33,844
tower, that kind of got me on this research journey.

560
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:37,744
- It makes me wonder what other mysteries like that are in the

561
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:43,364
archives. Do you think there's stuff like that in there that we deeply don't

562
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:47,364
understand? I mean about, for example,

563
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:51,314
there's a bunch of mysteries that we think we understand

564
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:54,844
maybe about the concentration camps, maybe about the Eastern

565
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:58,954
Front, the interplay between Stalin and Hitler.

566
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:02,924
Maybe about Britain that could be discovered

567
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:05,824
in the letters, in the data that were completely missing.

568
00:38:07,004 --> 00:38:10,864
- I think so. And I think that also there are archives that are

569
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:16,544
not open. Let's say the Vatican archive.

570
00:38:16,604 --> 00:38:20,284
Some secret archives that some very powerful structures

571
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:23,844
have, structures that we might not even know, you know,

572
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:27,784
now off the top of our head, which still have a huge influence.

573
00:38:27,844 --> 00:38:31,774
So I think that human history is quite different from

574
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:37,594
what most historians write. I think that's

575
00:38:37,684 --> 00:38:41,664
just one version. I think there are several

576
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:46,374
versions, and I think that it goes much deeper and is much more interesting.

577
00:38:47,804 --> 00:38:51,684
So I guess this history is a very active thing, which I also didn't know.

578
00:38:51,724 --> 00:38:52,934
You know, I was writing historical

579
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:58,124
non-fiction book, and I suddenly realized that this is like a shark pool

580
00:38:58,164 --> 00:39:01,914
because history defines the future or is

581
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,944
very connected. Our history teacher always said, "If we don't know

582
00:39:06,084 --> 00:39:10,044
where we come from, we cannot know where we go." And that is...

583
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:13,664
That is, I think, true. That is what I now really am

584
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:17,044
interested in for my next book. I'm trying to really understand human

585
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,904
history. And obviously, I'm not the first. There are a few, you

586
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:24,544
know, alternative historians that go like... Because you have to go back in

587
00:39:24,604 --> 00:39:28,574
time quite a bit, and then it's not easy to write about

588
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:32,544
it, but it's very interesting to think about. And I would love to find the

589
00:39:32,724 --> 00:39:36,364
truth on Atlantis, which I don't believe in, actually, and we can also talk about that.

590
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:40,244
But maybe there's an archive where we can actually see that they had

591
00:39:40,304 --> 00:39:43,393
this king ruling. I don't think this could be found, but,

592
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:47,474
I think we can still also find a lot

593
00:39:47,484 --> 00:39:51,904
of documents, but I think especially in closed archives. So we won't find them.

594
00:39:51,984 --> 00:39:55,864
- You said a lot of really interesting things. It's so important to have people like

595
00:39:55,924 --> 00:39:59,604
you that do the daring work of going to the archives, the sources, the

596
00:39:59,624 --> 00:40:04,384
evidence and trying to find a thing that completely transforms

597
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:11,224
history as we thought we understood it. That's revisionist history at its best.

598
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,984
Revisionist history has a sort of negative connotation

599
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:20,884
sometimes because you go to conspiratorial land without much

600
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:25,424
evidence, and you're just being a rebel for rebels' sake.

601
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:27,254
But when you ground it in data,

602
00:40:28,144 --> 00:40:31,324
and dare to challenge the historical narrative, that's really powerful. So,

603
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:37,904
I should also mention that we've been just setting, laying out the context.

604
00:40:37,964 --> 00:40:39,484
- Yeah. We're still in the context phase.

605
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:43,373
- In context phase. And for the next 10 hours,

606
00:40:43,423 --> 00:40:46,584
and maybe for the rest of our lives, we will be continuing just setting the

607
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:50,034
context. But let us dare return to the original question of,

608
00:40:50,124 --> 00:40:55,044
Pervitin. How did that come about? Take me to 1930s Nazi Germany.

609
00:40:55,064 --> 00:40:58,864
The Munich and the Berlin tension that we all laid out

610
00:40:58,944 --> 00:41:03,404
beautifully. How did Pervitin come into the picture?

611
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:08,884
- Well, the Nazis managed to grab power on January 30th, 1933,

612
00:41:10,544 --> 00:41:14,474
and they immediately became an anti-drug regime.

613
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:18,334
That is important to them because the only intoxication they allow from

614
00:41:18,424 --> 00:41:21,744
now on in Germany is the Nazi intoxication; it's the

615
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:28,984
ideological intoxication. So they quickly install concentration camps, which

616
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:32,444
were, at the time, run by the SA, not the SS.

617
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:36,684
The SS takes over later and turns the concentration camps into an

618
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:40,584
industry. The first SA concentration camps were in

619
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:47,064
cellars in Berlin or in the countryside. And some of the first people that

620
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,664
landed in these cellars and were disciplined were drug users. Also,

621
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:58,444
anti-Semitic policies were very important from day one for the Nazis, like

622
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:06,084
they. Anti-Semitism is the defining pillar of National Socialism.

623
00:42:06,164 --> 00:42:09,664
of it, really. They quickly

624
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:13,524
They connected anti-drug policies with anti-Semitic policies.

625
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:17,304
They claimed the Jews in Germany, the German Jews were taking more

626
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:23,584
drugs than the non-Jewish Germans. And National Socialism's

627
00:42:24,624 --> 00:42:28,324
goal was to purify the German body. So they saw the

628
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:32,114
whole Volk, the Volk, the country, the people,

629
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:36,174
the country, the people, as one body, and that has to be purified.

630
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:38,723
and that has to be purified. So all Jews are

631
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:42,784
poison. But not only Jews, everyone who thinks

632
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:46,594
differently. Communists are also poison. Jews are the worst poison, but, you know,

633
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,844
a lot of... Yeah, and then you create this clean body.

634
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:54,723
And obviously drugs have no position in that. If you're addicted to drugs, that's

635
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:58,203
weak, you know, you're a morphinist. You use cocaine, that's all

636
00:42:58,223 --> 00:43:01,564
degenerate, that's Jewish. Jewish doctors are all

637
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:08,663
morphinists, you know? So Nazi Germany and Hitler was the shining

638
00:43:08,723 --> 00:43:12,284
example of the person who doesn't take drugs. He

639
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:16,243
was, he didn't have a private life, he didn't even have a

640
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:22,683
body. He just led the Volksbody, you know? So Hitler

641
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:26,564
was not putting any poisons into him. He stopped smoking

642
00:43:26,663 --> 00:43:32,264
cigarettes in the '20s already. He never touched alcohol.

643
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:32,953
- Vegetarian.

644
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:39,203
- ...vegetarian, no caffeine even. So he

645
00:43:39,264 --> 00:43:42,784
was... That's what he was in the beginning. The story, of

646
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:46,913
course, changes at a certain point in time, but he started as this.

647
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:49,944
- As far as you understand, that's true? The beginning?

648
00:43:50,064 --> 00:43:53,984
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure that this is true.

649
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:57,574
Also, vegetarianism was a right-wing thing in Germany. It was an elitist thing.

650
00:43:57,604 --> 00:44:05,064
If you were a vegetarian, you had a higher frequency, which kind of gave you superiority

651
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:09,004
over, let's say, these workers who need to eat the sausage

652
00:44:09,084 --> 00:44:12,804
so you can, you know, do the work. Like Wagner, the composer, he was

653
00:44:12,904 --> 00:44:16,304
vegetarian. Hitler was impressed by Wagner. So,

654
00:44:16,384 --> 00:44:21,114
vegetarianism, all... I think that's all true. I think Hitler was like that. And...

655
00:44:23,104 --> 00:44:26,264
And it's hard to be like that actually, and I think that gave him

656
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:31,064
an attraction inside the movement to all drunk, you know,

657
00:44:31,104 --> 00:44:35,024
drunkards and Goering using morphine all the time because of his pain, he got used to morphine,

658
00:44:35,084 --> 00:44:38,944
because of his pain, he got used to morphine, so they were... The movement

659
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:42,203
wasn't like this, but he was like this. So he was,

660
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:49,584
He symbolized, but he symbolized that whole approach of cleanliness, like

661
00:44:49,624 --> 00:44:53,484
purity. So then how does methamphetamine come into the

662
00:44:53,504 --> 00:44:57,444
picture? It's totally absurd. That's why I thought it was fun researching this,

663
00:44:57,604 --> 00:44:59,743
because it doesn't make sense, you know?

664
00:45:01,004 --> 00:45:04,484
And, you know, they use this simple trick by, you know,

665
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:08,424
defining what is an illegal drug and what is not.

666
00:45:08,444 --> 00:45:12,284
Because drugs don't have it written on them, "This is an illegal, dangerous drug."

667
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:16,314
You know, drugs are basically neutral. These are molecules, you know?

668
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:19,824
So the methamphetamine molecule was found in a

669
00:45:19,864 --> 00:45:23,624
Berlin-based company called the Temmler Company.

670
00:45:23,824 --> 00:45:27,264
And the head of Temmler, he was very upset with the

671
00:45:27,304 --> 00:45:33,884
Olympics in 1936 because an Afro-American athlete, Jesse Owens,

672
00:45:34,604 --> 00:45:38,444
was running faster than German superheroes with the best genes, you know?

673
00:45:38,504 --> 00:45:42,404
How can this be? So they thought that he

674
00:45:42,484 --> 00:45:45,884
was on something, because he won, I think, five gold

675
00:45:45,964 --> 00:45:49,933
medals. It was ridiculous. This was supposed to be Germany's games,

676
00:45:49,984 --> 00:45:55,264
you know, and then the Afro-American runs better than the Aryan ubermensch.

677
00:45:56,203 --> 00:46:02,064
So the only explanation is he took a drug. He probably took Benzedrine,

678
00:46:02,864 --> 00:46:05,703
which was illegal amphetamine,

679
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:10,524
and there were also no doping checks at the Olympics.

680
00:46:10,604 --> 00:46:14,504
And if you're taking amphetamine, of course, you can run a bit faster maybe

681
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:18,444
when it kicks in. That this has to do with the immense release

682
00:46:18,504 --> 00:46:22,264
of dopamine in the brain.

683
00:46:23,524 --> 00:46:26,723
But it was never proven that Owens used any type of drugs,

684
00:46:26,764 --> 00:46:30,663
but the head of the Temmler Company, he said, "We have to prevent this. We

685
00:46:30,723 --> 00:46:37,564
have to invent a better amphetamine. We have to make a German amphetamine that is

686
00:46:37,683 --> 00:46:41,163
stronger than the American Benzedrine." So his main

687
00:46:41,203 --> 00:46:48,344
chemist, Fritz Hauschild, he did research and found that in 1917,

688
00:46:48,504 --> 00:46:52,224
in Tokyo, a Japanese chemist had made methamphetamine,

689
00:46:52,764 --> 00:46:56,703
and he remade that methamphetamine and they tested it among themselves,

690
00:46:56,743 --> 00:47:00,464
the chemists in the Berlin pharmaceutical lab, and they loved it.

691
00:47:00,524 --> 00:47:03,183
They made pure methamphetamine, and, you know, they

692
00:47:03,984 --> 00:47:07,524
had a really good time, and they were more active, they were talkative.

693
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:11,304
That's what happens with methamphetamine. So the company really thought

694
00:47:11,384 --> 00:47:14,944
this is a great product, and they turned it into a product.

695
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:19,064
They went to the patent bureaucracy and got the patent for methamphetamine,

696
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:22,973
and then it quite quickly came onto the market. It was labeled as Pervitin,

697
00:47:23,004 --> 00:47:26,864
which is a great name, because it has like the perverse already in it.

698
00:47:26,904 --> 00:47:34,224
And this Pervitin was available in any pharmacy, so you didn't need a prescription.

699
00:47:34,304 --> 00:47:38,124
A child could go and buy 10 packs of pure

700
00:47:38,163 --> 00:47:42,124
methamphetamine. So methamphetamine was also very cheap,

701
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:44,703
so it became quite popular because people, you know, talked about it.

702
00:47:44,743 --> 00:47:48,703
- Did they understand the side effects and negative effects of methamphetamine?

703
00:47:48,743 --> 00:47:49,743
Did they care?

704
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:53,624
- They didn't really know what it was. I mean, I also went to the archive of that

705
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:57,674
company also, of course. So they were like, "What is it good for?"

706
00:47:57,703 --> 00:48:01,683
Like, "I just feel great when I take it and I have more energy,"

707
00:48:02,203 --> 00:48:05,104
and they didn't know if that could be a product. It was

708
00:48:05,144 --> 00:48:08,384
1937, '38 when they were discovering it.

709
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:14,183
- But also, how did they think about the fact that this is a drug?

710
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:17,624
- Well, they called it a performance enhancer.

711
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:18,283
- Got it.

712
00:48:18,304 --> 00:48:22,203
- Is drinking coffee in the morning a drug? I mean, it is a drug, but

713
00:48:22,243 --> 00:48:24,663
we don't think of it as a drug, you know. It's legal.

714
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:29,804
And this was kind of how meth was treated in Germany. It was normal to use

715
00:48:29,864 --> 00:48:33,703
it. Like, you had a very important business meeting, of course, you would take a

716
00:48:33,743 --> 00:48:37,473
Pervitin. There's a movie by Billy Wilder called 1, 2,

717
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:42,084
3, a very good movie, and he shows... the

718
00:48:42,124 --> 00:48:46,034
American executive... The movie was set right after

719
00:48:46,084 --> 00:48:49,924
the end of the Second World War. So we

720
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:53,634
see, I think it's a Coca-Cola executive, American, and he says to his

721
00:48:53,684 --> 00:48:57,634
secretary, "How should I have the morning coffee? I think half a

722
00:48:57,664 --> 00:49:02,884
Pervitin." So Pervitin was normal, it wasn't stigmatized. It was

723
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:07,724
it was not the American "just say no" propaganda, where your

724
00:49:07,764 --> 00:49:14,904
teeth fall out and... I mean, it was a German quality product, people liked it.

725
00:49:14,964 --> 00:49:21,284
Of course, they did tests at universities. But most of them were quite positive.

726
00:49:21,344 --> 00:49:25,164
It reduces your fear. Today, we might,

727
00:49:25,204 --> 00:49:29,034
you know, look for different things, but this was also a performance-driven,

728
00:49:29,084 --> 00:49:31,924
totalitarian society moving towards war.

729
00:49:32,784 --> 00:49:36,564
So if someone takes Pervitin and says in the clinical tests at university, "I

730
00:49:36,584 --> 00:49:39,404
have- I'm not afraid of anything anymore." So that's

731
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:43,464
positive. That's actually what got the guy who worked for the German army

732
00:49:43,524 --> 00:49:47,443
interested, because he read university reports. Like I also saw

733
00:49:47,504 --> 00:49:51,444
all of these reports. They were also in the military archive. So he's like, "Okay,

734
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:55,184
you're not afraid anymore if you take methamphetamine. You don't need to sleep

735
00:49:55,224 --> 00:49:59,184
anymore. You don't need to eat so much, 'cause your appetite is lowered." Like,

736
00:49:59,244 --> 00:50:01,844
this is perfect for a soldier.

737
00:50:03,544 --> 00:50:08,904
Negative effects only became public in 1940, when the

738
00:50:08,984 --> 00:50:14,184
first Pervitin opponent, he was actually a relative

739
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:22,094
of Albert Speer, Hitler's architect, and later armament minister. He was this Speer

740
00:50:22,164 --> 00:50:26,114
psychologist. He was the first one who said, "Wait a minute. First

741
00:50:26,144 --> 00:50:30,074
of all, methamphetamine is against the Nazi ideology, because now we're all taking

742
00:50:30,184 --> 00:50:33,724
a drug to be high performers. We have to be high performers without a

743
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:37,624
drug." And he also said, "You know this- the obvious, this is gonna make you

744
00:50:37,664 --> 00:50:42,404
addicted," et cetera. "This will, you know, create a tolerance." So only then

745
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:47,284
the first negative reports came out. Before that, what Temmler did and then

746
00:50:47,324 --> 00:50:51,424
what the universities did, they all thought methamphetamine is really good.

747
00:50:51,444 --> 00:50:55,084
- So what was the process of convincing the German

748
00:50:55,144 --> 00:50:59,804
military, the Wehrmacht army, to use it at scale?

749
00:50:59,824 --> 00:51:03,704
- Well, Professor Ranke was employed by the army, so it was his

750
00:51:03,764 --> 00:51:07,364
job to find things that would improve the performance of the German

751
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:11,404
soldier. I always imagined him like a James Bond

752
00:51:11,464 --> 00:51:15,184
character, like Q, who develops gadgets and stuff, because he also

753
00:51:15,204 --> 00:51:16,284
developed gadgets.

754
00:51:17,404 --> 00:51:21,004
So he was quite a... you know, he was an academic, but he was also a

755
00:51:21,324 --> 00:51:24,764
soldier, you know? He was employed, but he was basically running this institute,

756
00:51:24,804 --> 00:51:30,734
examining it. And he was so convinced that Pervitin is the answer to his

757
00:51:31,804 --> 00:51:37,664
question: how to beat the main opponent of the German soldier. And that was not

758
00:51:38,244 --> 00:51:41,004
the British soldier, not the French soldier, not the Russian soldier. That was

759
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:46,864
fatigue. He had been looking for a way to keep a soldier awake

760
00:51:46,964 --> 00:51:53,314
longer. So when he read these reports from

761
00:51:53,364 --> 00:51:57,244
universities, he did his own tests in the military academy

762
00:51:57,304 --> 00:52:01,114
with young medical officers. They came together at 8:00

763
00:52:01,164 --> 00:52:07,933
PM in the evening, and then they received either methamphetamine, caffeine pill, or a

764
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:11,414
placebo, or Benzedrine. They had different experiments, and he always

765
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:15,344
concluded at the end, like they started at 8:00 PM and

766
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:19,404
at 10:00 AM in the morning, one time he notes, the Pervitin people still want to

767
00:52:19,444 --> 00:52:23,324
go out and party, while the caffeine guys are sleeping on the

768
00:52:23,364 --> 00:52:27,344
bench. You know, it was clear that Pervitin is the strongest.

769
00:52:27,384 --> 00:52:31,214
It gives you the most energy, lets you work for the longest time. So he was

770
00:52:31,224 --> 00:52:37,264
convinced, but his superior, the Surgeon General of the German army, was an old

771
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:40,933
school dude, and he didn't even react to these.

772
00:52:40,944 --> 00:52:44,724
Ranke would write letters, "We have to use this synthetic

773
00:52:44,844 --> 00:52:48,644
drug in the next campaign," which was against Poland, which he

774
00:52:48,684 --> 00:52:52,504
knew about. And because Pervitin was quite known in the

775
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:56,344
civil society, people were using it already. So he even

776
00:52:56,384 --> 00:53:00,274
said, "A lot of soldiers will just take it with them, and we should control that."

777
00:53:00,283 --> 00:53:04,204
"We should make it an official drug." But the Surgeon General

778
00:53:04,244 --> 00:53:08,024
didn't understand. He didn't reply. So Germany attacked

779
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:11,544
Poland without clear regulatory

780
00:53:11,684 --> 00:53:15,664
system on methamphetamine, and indeed, a lot of soldiers used it.

781
00:53:15,704 --> 00:53:19,604
And what Ranke then did was he requested from all the

782
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:23,654
medical officers in the field in Poland. The war was over after

783
00:53:23,664 --> 00:53:27,644
a few weeks. But the German army was occupying Poland. He said, "Send me all

784
00:53:27,724 --> 00:53:31,314
reports, and tell me: Did your people take

785
00:53:31,314 --> 00:53:35,254
Pervitin and what were the effects?" And he collected all these reports, which are also studied in

786
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:39,054
the military archive, and he came to the conclusion, "This is a really good

787
00:53:39,064 --> 00:53:42,984
fighting drug." And it probably is, because people are

788
00:53:43,124 --> 00:53:47,114
still using it today. Methamphetamine is still being used. And Ranke discovered

789
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:50,764
this. He had everything in front of him. And Poland was

790
00:53:50,804 --> 00:53:54,764
beaten, and then Hitler wanted to attack the West. And the West was a

791
00:53:54,804 --> 00:53:57,574
different story than Poland, because the West was

792
00:53:58,704 --> 00:54:02,684
the world empire of Great Britain combined with "La Grande

793
00:54:02,744 --> 00:54:06,224
Armée," the strongest army in the world, the French army. These two

794
00:54:06,264 --> 00:54:10,024
combined, you know, how can you win that? Poland,

795
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:13,304
they could overpower. They had, you know, a better army than Poland.

796
00:54:13,324 --> 00:54:16,824
But is the German Wehrmacht really better than both of these armies

797
00:54:16,864 --> 00:54:20,764
combined? His officers didn't think so. High Command

798
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:24,494
said, "No, we're not going to attack the West. We're going to lose." And

799
00:54:24,524 --> 00:54:28,444
Hitler was fanatic about it, he really wanted to attack.

800
00:54:28,484 --> 00:54:34,864
They were planning a coup against him in November 1939 just to prevent him

801
00:54:34,964 --> 00:54:38,944
ordering the attack on the West, because it would have been a catastrophe for

802
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:43,004
Germany. Because they really cared, you know? If you're High Command, you don't

803
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:46,844
want to start a war that you're going to lose, you know? Very bad.

804
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:52,044
- Can you just briefly give a sense of,

805
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:55,444
do you think this is genius or insanity on Hitler's part

806
00:54:56,024 --> 00:54:59,914
to think that he can take on probably what's

807
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:03,824
perceived to be the most powerful military in the world, which is the French military,

808
00:55:03,864 --> 00:55:05,984
or at least in Europe?

809
00:55:06,064 --> 00:55:09,563
- I think his hatred for the French was very, very deep. He

810
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:13,384
really, he really wanted to go to war with them. It was an

811
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:17,404
ideological, irrational decision. That's why he

812
00:55:17,504 --> 00:55:21,404
was not... He didn't hate the empire. He kind of looked down,

813
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,384
he admired it and looked down on--

814
00:55:23,424 --> 00:55:25,324
- You mean the British Empire?

815
00:55:25,344 --> 00:55:30,344
- But the French he really hated, and France had been the "Erbfeind," the

816
00:55:31,584 --> 00:55:35,344
genetic enemy of the German people, at least right-wingers would say

817
00:55:35,384 --> 00:55:39,264
so. There had been two wars.

818
00:55:39,304 --> 00:55:42,524
The first one Germany had won, then the First World War, Germany had

819
00:55:42,604 --> 00:55:46,344
lost. So Hitler wanted to kind of revenge and also

820
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:50,424
stop the Treaty of Versailles. So he really needed to attack the West, at least in his

821
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:54,124
mindset. But it was an irrational decision, and that's why High

822
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:58,044
"No, we're not going to do it," basically. And Hitler's position at the time

823
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,744
was not that he could do anything he wanted. I mean, high

824
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:05,494
command is still a high command of the German Wehrmacht. That's a

825
00:56:05,644 --> 00:56:09,354
very old, you know, it's a tradition. It's...

826
00:56:10,004 --> 00:56:13,764
They, they do whatever they want, you know? But also, they have to

827
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:18,104
obey Hitler's orders. So it's a power struggle, basically.

828
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:23,004
But to invade France was a totally stupid idea, but it changed

829
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:28,924
in the morning. On the morning of February 17th, 1940,

830
00:56:29,044 --> 00:56:32,844
Hitler invited three young tank generals to his office,

831
00:56:32,924 --> 00:56:36,764
and they had a plan, which was the plan to go through the Ardennes Mountains.

832
00:56:36,824 --> 00:56:40,604
That was the victorious idea. So it's not the drugs.

833
00:56:40,614 --> 00:56:44,604
Actually, that idea to go through the Ardennes Mountain, if you think monocausal,

834
00:56:44,644 --> 00:56:48,524
you would say that's the reason. That idea was genius,

835
00:56:48,564 --> 00:56:52,364
and Hitler immediately understood it because before, the plan was to

836
00:56:52,384 --> 00:56:55,964
attack in the north of Belgium, which is the same as World War I.

837
00:56:56,484 --> 00:57:00,354
You... It becomes a stalemate and they fight for months, and no one really moves,

838
00:57:00,364 --> 00:57:04,333
and it's bloody, and nothing's happening. It's a bad... But that was

839
00:57:04,364 --> 00:57:07,814
the only plan that they had. That's why the high command said, "No, we're not going to do it.

840
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:11,624
It's stupid." But these three tank generals, they had kind of

841
00:57:11,664 --> 00:57:15,404
somehow they were able to sneak into Hitler's office, and they said,

842
00:57:15,424 --> 00:57:19,164
"Look, if we go with the whole army through the Ardennes

843
00:57:19,224 --> 00:57:22,814
Mountains," and like Hitler, "Eh, this is not possible. This is like a mountain range.

844
00:57:22,844 --> 00:57:24,974
How can the whole German army fit through this

845
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:29,584
eye of a needle, basically?" And they said, "No, we can do it because

846
00:57:29,644 --> 00:57:33,844
everyone misunderstands what tanks can do. Tanks are not

847
00:57:35,884 --> 00:57:41,764
slow machines in the back that kind of wait for the

848
00:57:41,924 --> 00:57:45,904
action to happen and then, you know, I don't know, support it somehow. We're going to

849
00:57:45,964 --> 00:57:49,604
use tanks in the front as race cars, basically. We're gonna

850
00:57:49,724 --> 00:57:53,484
overpower the enemy. We're gonna be in France

851
00:57:53,544 --> 00:57:57,254
before the French, who are stationed all with the British in northern Belgium

852
00:57:57,324 --> 00:58:00,584
and also on the Maginot Line, but not really in the Ardennes Mountains.

853
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:04,104
That was hardly fortified because no one could imagine that Germany would go through

854
00:58:04,144 --> 00:58:07,924
there. And before they know it, we are already

855
00:58:07,964 --> 00:58:11,064
behind them, basically. We are already in France, and they're

856
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:15,053
still hanging out in northern Belgium because it takes quite a while, you know,

857
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:18,784
to travel. This was a different time also.

858
00:58:18,904 --> 00:58:22,844
So he was convinced, and he then ordered the

859
00:58:22,884 --> 00:58:28,724
attack. The attack would happen, but it would only work

860
00:58:29,564 --> 00:58:33,384
if you would reach Sedan, the border city of France, within three days and three

861
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:37,304
nights. So the whole army, or at least, you know, the avant-garde

862
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:41,064
of the machinery, had to be like a big part of the

863
00:58:41,124 --> 00:58:44,344
army, had to be in Sedan after three days and three

864
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:48,544
nights. And that was only possible if you don't stop.

865
00:58:49,464 --> 00:58:53,294
And that was the problem. The sleep suddenly became a huge problem,

866
00:58:53,304 --> 00:58:56,854
and Hitler said, "When I was fighting

867
00:58:57,684 --> 00:59:01,044
in World War I, of course I could stay awake for a week. I'm a

868
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,804
German." You know, even though he's not even German, he's

869
00:59:04,544 --> 00:59:07,504
Austrian. But that was a problem.

870
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:14,144
Suddenly Ranke realized that his moment had come because he had the recipe

871
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:18,784
of how people could stay awake for three days and three nights. So Ranke suddenly

872
00:59:18,844 --> 00:59:22,624
So Ranke suddenly became... Before that, he was kind of an outsider, a freak with a drug idea.

873
00:59:22,664 --> 00:59:26,524
Suddenly, he became, "Okay, tell us, how does it work?"

874
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:30,304
And he gave lectures in front of the officers, and he wrote a stimulant

875
00:59:30,344 --> 00:59:34,184
decree where a whole army is prescribed a drug,

876
00:59:34,344 --> 00:59:37,524
in this case, methamphetamine. "How much should be taken?

877
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:41,524
At what intervals? What are the side effects?" This became a very big thing.

878
00:59:41,564 --> 00:59:46,674
And then Temmler had to deliver 35 million dosages

879
00:59:47,724 --> 00:59:51,444
to the front lines, which were... No, not the front yet. They were stationed

880
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:55,464
in the west of Germany.

881
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:59,484
Then on May 10th, they took their methamphetamine, and they started

882
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:01,724
the surprise attack through the Ardennes Mountains.

883
01:00:01,744 --> 01:00:05,544
- So the 35 million dosages for the French campaign.

884
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:07,924
I mean, we could probably talk for many hours

885
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:12,674
about this particular campaign, because it is, I think,

886
01:00:12,724 --> 01:00:18,984
it's fair to say, the most successful military campaign from the German side.

887
01:00:19,044 --> 01:00:21,724
- Ended with a big mistake, Dunkirk.

888
01:00:21,764 --> 01:00:22,424
- Dunkirk.

889
01:00:22,484 --> 01:00:26,324
- It was brilliant up until that point. That is the turning point.

890
01:00:26,364 --> 01:00:29,184
That was the first big mistake Hitler made, and it also had to do with drugs.

891
01:00:29,204 --> 01:00:32,004
- We'll talk about it, but let's just linger on this three days.

892
01:00:32,064 --> 01:00:32,214
- Right.

893
01:00:32,244 --> 01:00:35,464
- We should also mention that's where Blitzkrieg really

894
01:00:35,524 --> 01:00:38,904
shined. So it wasn't just the tanks, it was the infantry, it was the

895
01:00:38,964 --> 01:00:46,664
aircraft moving very fast behind the French lines. I mean, what can you

896
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:50,464
speak to just the execution of that campaign and the role of drugs in it?

897
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:57,204
And we should say it's a really bold strategic decision to use meth.

898
01:00:57,244 --> 01:01:01,236
I mean, it's a big risk. There are a lot of risks taken

899
01:01:01,296 --> 01:01:04,515
here, which could be seen as military genius or military

900
01:01:04,556 --> 01:01:08,495
insanity, or a mixture of both.

901
01:01:08,596 --> 01:01:12,535
- Well, they were very lucky that it all worked out. Also,

902
01:01:12,576 --> 01:01:16,435
the guys in the tanks could have all freaked out on the meth.

903
01:01:16,495 --> 01:01:20,455
It was never tested before, "Can you actually be in a combat situation, in a

904
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:24,406
tank, in enemy territory, on meth? Can people

905
01:01:24,495 --> 01:01:26,816
actually cope with that and be better fighters?"

906
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,216
- Going through the mountains...

907
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:29,955
- It's insane, yeah.

908
01:01:29,995 --> 01:01:33,136
- ...against the biggest military in Europe.

909
01:01:33,176 --> 01:01:40,915
- Well, what meth does is... I read reports of a depressed atmosphere

910
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:44,975
right before the attack started because they were afraid.

911
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:48,966
They thought they would lose. They didn't want that. You know, soldiers,

912
01:01:48,995 --> 01:01:52,785
maybe some really hardcore Nazi soldiers, but most people were normal guys.

913
01:01:52,816 --> 01:01:55,975
They didn't want to start that. But once they had the

914
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:59,935
methamphetamine, it kind of... you're in a party mood.

915
01:01:59,975 --> 01:02:03,756
So also, when you're in the tank, everyone likes it. It's

916
01:02:03,856 --> 01:02:07,796
rather an uplifting thing. They were really getting into

917
01:02:07,856 --> 01:02:11,676
it, and they really started fighting then. It's

918
01:02:11,816 --> 01:02:14,535
also intoxication, you know? It's a rush.

919
01:02:14,576 --> 01:02:19,375
- What does meth feel like?

920
01:02:19,395 --> 01:02:26,895
- Well, meth creates the so-called fight or flight modus.

921
01:02:26,935 --> 01:02:30,785
releases all the neurotransmitters in the brain which are released

922
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:34,676
in situations of high danger, for example. So in a highly

923
01:02:34,716 --> 01:02:38,066
dangerous situation, you become very alert, so you can cope with the

924
01:02:38,116 --> 01:02:41,415
situation, if you're, like, under life threat and you don't

925
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:44,995
even react to it, you're probably gonna be dead, you know?

926
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:48,915
But the body does that, and methamphetamine

927
01:02:48,935 --> 01:02:52,676
does that. So you take a pill of methamphetamine or you snort a line of

928
01:02:52,716 --> 01:02:56,656
methamphetamine and you're like this. And,

929
01:02:56,716 --> 01:03:00,636
then it's the fight or flight mode. Either you run away like it's too much, you know?

930
01:03:00,696 --> 01:03:04,676
But on meth, you usually don't run away. You kind of think

931
01:03:04,716 --> 01:03:08,345
it's really cool what's happening. You like to move, you like to be with your pals, you like

932
01:03:08,375 --> 01:03:10,326
to, you know, be in a tank is great on meth.

933
01:03:10,356 --> 01:03:12,236
- So there is a party aspect to it?

934
01:03:12,296 --> 01:03:15,216
- I think it was very joyful for the German soldiers because it was

935
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:22,796
springtime. They had immediate successes. And it wasn't heavy fighting, it was just

936
01:03:22,836 --> 01:03:26,136
being in the tank. I mean, there was, of course, fighting and there were also war crimes.

937
01:03:26,176 --> 01:03:29,656
And I read a report when Rommel, high on meth,

938
01:03:29,716 --> 01:03:33,375
at night, doesn't stop, of course, because they all, you

939
01:03:33,415 --> 01:03:37,316
know... They didn't stop at night, but every army usually stops at night. So the French

940
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:39,796
army were stopping. They were in a village

941
01:03:40,596 --> 01:03:44,256
camping out, and the German, Rommel, was going

942
01:03:44,555 --> 01:03:48,236
with the tank through that village with his division, just

943
01:03:48,316 --> 01:03:52,156
running over people. And he was standing like in the open

944
01:03:52,276 --> 01:03:56,096
lid of the tank, and he was like, going through that thing, you

945
01:03:56,156 --> 01:04:00,086
know, and you know, like a berserk type of warrior.

946
01:04:00,136 --> 01:04:03,475
And that was when... That to me is a war

947
01:04:03,596 --> 01:04:07,495
crime. That is when the Wehrmacht lost its innocence in

948
01:04:07,596 --> 01:04:11,515
that push of Rommel through the French countryside.

949
01:04:11,526 --> 01:04:15,455
Because you don't do that, you know? Your enemy is sleeping. Because the French

950
01:04:15,515 --> 01:04:19,435
also had a drug regulation. They received three quarters of a

951
01:04:19,475 --> 01:04:23,196
liter of red wine per man per day. So, of course, at

952
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:27,236
night, they're going to be sleepy on red wine, and the Germans were

953
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:31,015
on meth and they were just running over them. There's descriptions of the

954
01:04:31,096 --> 01:04:35,076
chains of the tank becoming bloody. I don't think he did it, and he was like, "Oh my

955
01:04:35,136 --> 01:04:39,076
God, what did I just do? I'm sorry." "What am I doing here?" He

956
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:41,536
was in the movie, you know?

957
01:04:41,636 --> 01:04:44,055
- This is the dark thing about human nature, that

958
01:04:44,915 --> 01:04:48,336
in war, if you dehumanize, if you allow your brain to

959
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:54,455
dehumanize the enemy, the opponent, the humans on the other side, you can

960
01:04:54,526 --> 01:04:58,296
actually... I think hate can take

961
01:04:58,375 --> 01:05:04,286
over, and in that hate you can find pleasure when you murder the other. And

962
01:05:05,555 --> 01:05:09,156
people have written about this, they've talked about this. It's probably a thing

963
01:05:09,216 --> 01:05:13,076
that a person like me can't possibly comprehend unless they experienced

964
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:18,875
it. And you have to be in the mania, in the hysteria, in the insanity intensity of

965
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,256
war.

966
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:25,426
- I mean, what Evans, for example, said is that, "I excuse the

967
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:29,415
Germans of the war crimes because they were just in an intoxication." I

968
01:05:29,455 --> 01:05:31,455
understand that argument, but... And

969
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,875
if you look at individual soldiers, it's quite tricky. Like, it's a

970
01:05:35,895 --> 01:05:42,756
19-year-old guy, he's been drafted. And in Nazi Germany, if you don't go,

971
01:05:42,816 --> 01:05:46,636
you land in the concentration camp. So you can choose, you know, concentration camp

972
01:05:46,756 --> 01:05:50,336
or you just join the ranks and then you get Pervitin and then you invade

973
01:05:50,375 --> 01:05:54,236
France. There was a trial in Germany because someone

974
01:05:54,356 --> 01:05:58,216
said all soldiers are murderers. And I think

975
01:05:58,256 --> 01:06:02,196
then the German Bundeswehr sued him. "No, soldiers are not murderers." And

976
01:06:02,216 --> 01:06:06,006
he actually won in court. So it's legal in Germany to call every

977
01:06:06,316 --> 01:06:12,515
soldier a murderer. But it's a tricky question.

978
01:06:12,576 --> 01:06:16,406
- Yeah, I remember seeing this documentary on the ordinary people. I think there's also social pressure.

979
01:06:17,076 --> 01:06:21,036
Again, insane it is to say, I think the documentary, Ordinary People,

980
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:25,736
was looking at the Germans that were a part of the shooting squads.

981
01:06:25,745 --> 01:06:28,636
And, you know, they didn't understand what they're signing up

982
01:06:28,696 --> 01:06:32,676
for, and they were told that they're free to leave

983
01:06:32,736 --> 01:06:36,506
once they understand what they're doing, and many of them didn't. And they didn't have

984
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:41,586
hate for Jews or for the people who they're murdering. You are,

985
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:44,576
again, a 19, 20-year-old young kid,

986
01:06:45,995 --> 01:06:51,015
like, it's so hard to comprehend the moral insanity that's happening all around you

987
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,616
and you just kind of want to fit in.

988
01:06:54,696 --> 01:06:58,395
- I mean, that's why I wrote the book, The Bohemians, because there were a few people in

989
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:02,316
Berlin that didn't react this way, but they reacted in

990
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:06,732
a different way. They said, "We cannot be part of this."

991
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:07,862
- But it's hard to be the person—

992
01:07:07,872 --> 01:07:10,232
- It's very hard, yeah. And most people are part of it

993
01:07:11,432 --> 01:07:15,352
because it's much more safe, or at least it seems more safe. I mean, it has its

994
01:07:15,392 --> 01:07:22,692
own perils, you know. Because you might become a genocidal murderer, you

995
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:25,732
know. That might happen. Like, are you responsible?

996
01:07:26,612 --> 01:07:29,062
I would say you are responsible, but that's just my

997
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:32,412
personal gut feeling. Like, I always thought my

998
01:07:32,432 --> 01:07:36,352
grandfather was responsible for the genocide because he was working

999
01:07:36,372 --> 01:07:40,312
for the German railway system, and he once saw a train car full of

1000
01:07:40,372 --> 01:07:44,342
Jews in a cattle wagon, and he only said

1001
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:48,292
to me, "Yeah, this was against German railway regulations." And I

1002
01:07:48,352 --> 01:07:52,072
said, "So what did you do?" And he said, "Well, there were SS at the station when I was

1003
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:55,212
working, and I was too scared. I didn't do

1004
01:07:55,222 --> 01:07:58,162
anything." So I thought that he was... he

1005
01:07:58,332 --> 01:08:02,321
made himself guilty, I thought. That's... and my

1006
01:08:02,352 --> 01:08:06,242
father, for example, reacted very strongly because of that. He never called him by his first

1007
01:08:06,242 --> 01:08:10,212
name, the father of his wife, because he

1008
01:08:10,291 --> 01:08:13,652
still had that, you know, he was a Nazi because he was working for the

1009
01:08:13,692 --> 01:08:19,812
railway. So I wouldn't excuse... I wouldn't excuse people actually,

1010
01:08:20,712 --> 01:08:26,852
and I certainly would not excuse high-ranking politicians that make policies because

1011
01:08:27,932 --> 01:08:31,332
the genocidal policies that the Nazis

1012
01:08:31,392 --> 01:08:35,212
developed and the war policies that they developed had

1013
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:39,171
nothing to do with drugs. And I never write that in any, you know, because there's

1014
01:08:39,192 --> 01:08:43,042
no documents. If I would find documents that say, "Yeah, when we..." you know,

1015
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:46,631
but this the Nazi ideology has nothing to do with drugs. Maybe with

1016
01:08:46,712 --> 01:08:50,562
alcohol, you know, but it's... and I spoke with

1017
01:08:50,591 --> 01:08:54,332
my father, who had been a high judge in Germany. What does actually the law say, and the

1018
01:08:54,392 --> 01:08:56,652
law says if you plan a crime

1019
01:08:59,252 --> 01:09:03,011
and then maybe when you commit it, you are under the influence, it does

1020
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:06,631
not diminish your responsibility. Your

1021
01:09:06,752 --> 01:09:10,631
responsibility is only diminished... Let's say you're a totally normal person,

1022
01:09:10,692 --> 01:09:14,492
never done any harm to anybody, and suddenly you take a

1023
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:18,312
drug that... or you're totally drunk, and you don't know what you're doing and you kill

1024
01:09:18,372 --> 01:09:21,952
someone. Then a judge could say maybe you have a lesser

1025
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:25,732
responsibility. But this is not the case

1026
01:09:25,812 --> 01:09:29,671
with the crimes of National Socialism, and I never even

1027
01:09:29,752 --> 01:09:32,952
hint at that in my book. So I think that criticism by Evans

1028
01:09:34,932 --> 01:09:39,452
was short-sighted. I wouldn't... I think he's not right about that.

1029
01:09:39,511 --> 01:09:43,152
- Yeah, I think I agree with you totally. I didn't get that sense.

1030
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:46,612
- He thought the book was very successful because a lot of right-wing people bought

1031
01:09:46,652 --> 01:09:50,091
it, but that's not... it's simply not true.

1032
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:55,101
- I think your book did a masterful job of never

1033
01:09:55,972 --> 01:09:59,652
making itself amenable to that kind of narrative.

1034
01:09:59,692 --> 01:10:03,792
- To the contrary, I got an angry letter by a German army

1035
01:10:05,052 --> 01:10:11,152
employee, quite a high officer and a military historian, and he said that

1036
01:10:12,472 --> 01:10:16,132
I... he also thought I overemphasized the drug

1037
01:10:16,452 --> 01:10:20,432
use of the methamphetamine in the western campaign because he said the German

1038
01:10:20,532 --> 01:10:24,152
army was just so good, and you kind of diminish

1039
01:10:24,192 --> 01:10:27,812
their capability by saying they were only so good because they took

1040
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:31,772
methamphetamine. I thought that was kind of funny because the Wehrmacht

1041
01:10:31,972 --> 01:10:35,952
doesn't exist anymore, and the current German army is called the Bundeswehr,

1042
01:10:35,972 --> 01:10:39,932
and they're not... historically, they're not supposed to be connected. Like, there was a

1043
01:10:40,472 --> 01:10:44,452
clear-cut, but he still felt that I was kind of hurting the

1044
01:10:44,492 --> 01:10:46,512
pride of the Wehrmacht, so.

1045
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:52,952
- I generally sort of agree with him. In general, it seems like great historians

1046
01:10:53,012 --> 01:10:59,392
often... I'm just a human, so I'm not a historian, but they undermine

1047
01:11:01,212 --> 01:11:04,552
the importance of the heroes that make up an

1048
01:11:04,562 --> 01:11:08,552
army. The Soviet Army, the British Army, the French Army,

1049
01:11:08,592 --> 01:11:15,112
the German Army. These are humans, and some of the great military campaigns

1050
01:11:15,152 --> 01:11:18,892
involve people really stepping up. Now, the

1051
01:11:18,932 --> 01:11:22,652
effectiveness of the military tactics with blitzkrieg, the effectiveness of

1052
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:26,312
meth, the strategic decisions around where to

1053
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:30,242
invade, the timing, the speed, all those are important, but there's humans

1054
01:11:30,332 --> 01:11:35,632
there. There's real heroes. And sometimes historians kind of

1055
01:11:36,752 --> 01:11:40,552
diminish that. I don't know what to make sense of it. I might be just an idiot,

1056
01:11:41,152 --> 01:11:44,902
but I've had a great conversation with James Holland. I've gotten to know him well.

1057
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:48,402
He kind of analyzed the mistakes made by Hitler and by Stalin in the

1058
01:11:48,492 --> 01:11:52,252
Operation Barbarossa. But I

1059
01:11:52,332 --> 01:11:56,132
just, through generations, because I grew up in the Soviet

1060
01:11:56,252 --> 01:12:00,072
Union, you hear these stories of these heroes, you know.

1061
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:04,122
My grandfather was a machine gunner and

1062
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:07,132
miraculously survived. And, like, and just knowing those

1063
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:11,072
stories, Stalingrad would not have happened without the

1064
01:12:11,172 --> 01:12:15,122
heroes on the Soviet side. It's easy to say there's a lot of blunders,

1065
01:12:15,172 --> 01:12:18,972
a lot of bad tactics, all this kind of stuff, but to me, from the

1066
01:12:19,032 --> 01:12:25,242
human side, I just know through my bloodline, the people that have

1067
01:12:26,332 --> 01:12:30,212
fearlessly given their life to defend their homeland,

1068
01:12:30,232 --> 01:12:34,192
and that sometimes can be a little bit easily dismissed. So, I don't know what

1069
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:37,872
to make sense of it. Maybe I'm romanticizing or maybe I'm speaking to the

1070
01:12:37,932 --> 01:12:41,722
suffering that the people have felt, and they just

1071
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:45,272
propagate themselves through my life story, and then maybe the gratitude I have

1072
01:12:46,332 --> 01:12:50,512
for the people who have stopped the Nazi forces.

1073
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:54,622
- I think it's amazing what the Russian soldiers actually did because

1074
01:12:54,692 --> 01:12:58,552
they beat the Wehrmacht. It was really the Red Army on

1075
01:12:58,592 --> 01:13:02,252
the ground that did the job, you know. And did they love

1076
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:06,712
communism and the system? I don't think so, and I think they were... I mean, of

1077
01:13:06,752 --> 01:13:13,192
course, some people, but basically, they were defending their country, and... I'm

1078
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:15,012
also very grateful to them.

1079
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:18,392
- Yeah, they're defending their families. Quick pause. Bathroom break?

1080
01:13:18,452 --> 01:13:20,012
- Okay.

1081
01:13:20,132 --> 01:13:27,302
- All right, we're back. So can you say a bit more about the French campaigns in,

1082
01:13:27,392 --> 01:13:33,752
um... It was over in six weeks. It took six weeks to defeat and occupy

1083
01:13:33,772 --> 01:13:40,252
most of France. And the initial operation, three

1084
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:44,172
days, was, from a military perspective, successful.

1085
01:13:44,832 --> 01:13:48,812
What else can we say about the role

1086
01:13:48,852 --> 01:13:53,552
of drugs, the effectiveness, what was learned from that experience by the Wehrmacht?

1087
01:13:53,612 --> 01:13:57,132
- I mean, for me to research the Western campaign was very interesting

1088
01:13:58,032 --> 01:14:01,352
because I didn't really know anything about it except that Germany won very

1089
01:14:01,412 --> 01:14:06,772
quickly. So to actually look at the details is very interesting,

1090
01:14:07,612 --> 01:14:10,132
and the drugs give you a way in.

1091
01:14:10,172 --> 01:14:13,532
- What are some things you found in the archives that were interesting, like, about maybe

1092
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:17,532
letters, reports, diaries, that gave you some insight

1093
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:20,992
about the human story of it all?

1094
01:14:21,032 --> 01:14:24,872
- Well, there are letters, for example, by Heinrich Böll, who won the Nobel

1095
01:14:24,932 --> 01:14:28,692
Prize later in literature. He writes to his parents describing in detail

1096
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:32,432
what Pervitin did to him, how it kept his mood

1097
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:36,492
up, and that without Pervitin, he wouldn't have been able to do the

1098
01:14:36,552 --> 01:14:40,462
job. But also military documents I found very interesting. For

1099
01:14:40,472 --> 01:14:43,952
example, I could see exactly how the methamphetamine was

1100
01:14:43,972 --> 01:14:47,842
distributed because it was not distributed equally.

1101
01:14:48,552 --> 01:14:52,432
It was done in a way that the tank troops who were leading the advance received

1102
01:14:52,472 --> 01:14:56,152
the most meth, and they also needed it.

1103
01:14:56,272 --> 01:15:00,142
I could see how many pills on which date were delivered

1104
01:15:00,172 --> 01:15:03,892
to Rommel's troops. And Rommel became, I call him the Crystal Fox

1105
01:15:04,812 --> 01:15:11,692
in my book for obvious reasons. His division was using a lot of meth.

1106
01:15:11,732 --> 01:15:13,132
- And he was using meth as well?

1107
01:15:14,242 --> 01:15:18,092
- I just have descriptions how he, like, totally crazy

1108
01:15:18,152 --> 01:15:21,992
stands in the open lid of the tank and all his people, well, they had the

1109
01:15:22,052 --> 01:15:23,611
meth, but there's no-

1110
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:24,412
- So you can infer from that.

1111
01:15:24,692 --> 01:15:29,422
- There's no, maybe they didn't use it. Maybe he didn't use it.

1112
01:15:29,432 --> 01:15:33,232
But it looks like he used it. There were also never any reports that

1113
01:15:33,372 --> 01:15:37,292
all the meth was given back. I mean, a lot of soldiers write

1114
01:15:37,352 --> 01:15:43,732
that they take it, but Rommel specifically, I wouldn't write in my book, Blitz,

1115
01:15:43,852 --> 01:15:47,812
that Rommel would take methamphetamine.

1116
01:15:47,852 --> 01:15:51,782
on such a day or something if there was no record for it. But Rommel,

1117
01:15:51,832 --> 01:15:55,792
there is a record for it that Rommel's division used the

1118
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:59,762
most meth of any tank division. So, I write about that. And that's,

1119
01:15:59,792 --> 01:16:02,712
that already makes him the Crystal Fox because, you know,

1120
01:16:03,832 --> 01:16:06,932
in his division, crystal meth is, you know, rampant.

1121
01:16:06,972 --> 01:16:10,112
- You know, it's like in Animal Farm when the pigs discover

1122
01:16:10,192 --> 01:16:14,042
alcohol. Animal Farm by George Orwell. There's no evidence that they

1123
01:16:14,072 --> 01:16:18,482
drank. It's just the next day that they're all hungover.

1124
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:21,102
- I mean, Rommel is a very interesting character in general because

1125
01:16:22,132 --> 01:16:26,052
later he turned, apparently, turned against Hitler. He was

1126
01:16:26,112 --> 01:16:32,232
part of the conspiracy of Operation Valkyrie. He received, you

1127
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:36,272
know, the offer to shoot himself in the forest,

1128
01:16:36,312 --> 01:16:40,372
which he did instead of being tried and executed.

1129
01:16:40,412 --> 01:16:44,392
- Is he just part of this general tension that the generals, the

1130
01:16:44,452 --> 01:16:48,432
military had with Hitler? Would that be fair to say?

1131
01:16:48,512 --> 01:16:52,392
- I would say so, yes. I'm not an expert on the Wehrmacht.

1132
01:16:52,452 --> 01:16:56,412
This is a very complex, large organization. But

1133
01:16:57,012 --> 01:17:00,412
I see most of the officers of the Wehrmacht as not

1134
01:17:00,452 --> 01:17:04,332
necessarily Nazis in the way that they would, you know, shout, "Heil Hitler," all the time.

1135
01:17:04,352 --> 01:17:10,992
They were highly intelligent, highly trained, super professionals that ran a very

1136
01:17:11,032 --> 01:17:14,912
effective war machine. And at one

1137
01:17:14,952 --> 01:17:18,942
point, more and more of these generals realized that the orders that

1138
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:22,932
Hitler was giving were not really helping, you know, and they have their

1139
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:30,652
men dying because of it. So that creates a lot of tension. And that led to

1140
01:17:30,732 --> 01:17:33,152
the mistake that Hitler did in Dunkirk,

1141
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:36,932
basically. What Churchill called the sickle cut, which was the idea

1142
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:40,832
to storm through the Ardennes Mountains and kind of cut off the British and

1143
01:17:40,912 --> 01:17:44,572
French troops who were still, you know, in the north of Belgium trying to figure out what was going

1144
01:17:44,632 --> 01:17:48,552
on. Suddenly, the Germans are behind them, so they kind of cut

1145
01:17:48,652 --> 01:17:52,452
like a sickle into enemy territory, the sickle cut. That was so

1146
01:17:52,532 --> 01:18:00,172
successful that, basically, the campaign was won already. So then the Germans

1147
01:18:00,212 --> 01:18:04,112
invaded, like occupied all the cities on the canal

1148
01:18:04,152 --> 01:18:07,912
back to England to kind of cut off the British completely, so they

1149
01:18:07,952 --> 01:18:11,712
couldn't, you know, even flee. But Dunkirk was open, the

1150
01:18:11,752 --> 01:18:15,272
last port that was open. And the German army was like,

1151
01:18:16,492 --> 01:18:20,372
you know, they were already on the outskirts of Dunkirk. They could have just taken

1152
01:18:20,412 --> 01:18:27,812
it and closed that, you know, that hole for the British military to get out. But

1153
01:18:27,852 --> 01:18:31,772
Hitler then did his famous... And this is all the

1154
01:18:31,782 --> 01:18:35,082
dynamic of the Western campaign, you know. A lot of things happen every day. And

1155
01:18:35,112 --> 01:18:38,682
then they're saying like, "We're going to have Dunkirk tomorrow and then it's

1156
01:18:38,772 --> 01:18:42,512
over." And then Hitler stops the tanks. It's his famous

1157
01:18:42,572 --> 01:18:46,352
Halte Befehl, the order to stop. And

1158
01:18:46,532 --> 01:18:50,412
you know, they were all on meth. They didn't want to stop. But Hitler was not

1159
01:18:50,452 --> 01:18:58,372
on meth. Hitler was, he was, he- he basically, it was a little bit similar than

1160
01:18:58,412 --> 01:19:01,812
Berlin, Munich thing. Hitler didn't really

1161
01:19:01,852 --> 01:19:05,792
understand that campaign. It was too fast for him. He... Because

1162
01:19:05,812 --> 01:19:09,732
they didn't say like, "Oh, they're all on meth. They're not going to sleep. They're going to behave erratically."

1163
01:19:09,772 --> 01:19:13,532
They didn't discuss this. They discussed this in the old-fashioned terms. And Hitler was

1164
01:19:13,632 --> 01:19:17,412
seeing like, "They do not protect their flanks. What if the

1165
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:21,019
British come from the north?" This is terrible.

1166
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,630
Militarily, it was, they were already fighting

1167
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,960
World War II, while Hitler was still fighting World War I. And

1168
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,780
especially the Allies, they were still fighting World War I. But the tank generals on

1169
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:36,800
meth, or the tank generals without meth, the tank generals per se, they were fighting

1170
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,210
a new type of war. And Hitler

1171
01:19:41,019 --> 01:19:44,620
then got a visit from Goering, the head of the air force, the

1172
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:48,519
Luftwaffe. And Goering was a morphinist. That is very well

1173
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:52,460
documented. He was on morphine. He was high as a kite most of the

1174
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:59,400
time. And that comes with losing touch with reality, I would say, or at least it

1175
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:03,190
changes your grip on reality, you know. Maybe you're still a good

1176
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,590
decision-maker, but it could lead to... You know, if you're

1177
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:10,550
intoxicated, let's say you're writing, and you're intoxicated, you think it's great, but the next

1178
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:12,840
day you read it, and it's shit, you know?

1179
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:18,160
Goering was using morphine in the morning, then met Hitler at the

1180
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,840
Felsennest, which was Hitler's headquarters to command

1181
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:27,160
the Western campaign, the Felsennest. And Goering said to him,

1182
01:20:28,559 --> 01:20:32,300
"If the army generals are now gonna take Dunkirk,

1183
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:36,120
then basically the army has won this campaign, and that will

1184
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:39,370
give army high command, which is already against you,"

1185
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:44,360
because they were, you know, for them, Hitler was always like, "der

1186
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,120
kleine Gefreite," like this small, kind of regular army

1187
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:52,030
guy because that's what Hitler had been in the First World War, and now

1188
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:56,080
suddenly, he was the big decision-maker. So they never, they thought they make much better

1189
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:00,019
decisions than him. So Goering says, "Their power will be so

1190
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,120
overwhelming that they will, from now on, call the shots how this war will continue

1191
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,120
and what will be done next. You should let me with the

1192
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,559
Luftwaffe do the job from the air. The National

1193
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,480
Socialist Luftwaffe is gonna end the Western campaign." So he

1194
01:21:16,559 --> 01:21:20,380
thought that he could destroy... It doesn't make

1195
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:24,190
sense, you know. Even to destroy the British military from

1196
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,050
with planes, maybe you can do it. But certainly, he couldn't do

1197
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:31,920
it. So the tank generals received the

1198
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:35,800
Haltebefehl, the stopping order. They didn't believe it when they

1199
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,780
received it, because the victory, this would've been complete

1200
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,559
victory over Great Britain. This would've been the end of Great Britain. The

1201
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:47,600
whole British military was encircled, but they did get out

1202
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:51,220
through Dunkirk. That's why the movie Dunkirk with Christopher Nolan is not good because he

1203
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,960
doesn't describe what happened on the German side. It's just this heroic

1204
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:58,760
British thing, "Yeah, we just got out and we reformed, and then we

1205
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,870
beat..." You know. This was just because Hitler was afraid of the

1206
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:09,700
power of his army high command, and convinced by Goering's morphine-high

1207
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:14,420
vision that he would stop it with the air force, which he couldn't,

1208
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:18,360
which he couldn't. I mean, he bombed, and then the British, you know, they were on ships, and a few ships were

1209
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:22,340
sunk, but basically, they got, they got out. You need to do this on the ground. At least

1210
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:25,740
back then, you would've needed to do it on the ground. So that was a big mistake by

1211
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:29,629
Hitler. That's why von Manstein, one of the three tank generals from

1212
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,200
February 17th, it was Rommel, von Manstein, and Guderian, and von

1213
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,340
Manstein, he later said, he spoke of a

1214
01:22:37,559 --> 01:22:41,400
"lost victory." He said the Western campaign was a lost victory

1215
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:45,340
because we really could have achieved the victory. We could've

1216
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:49,260
dominated, you know, Britain. They could've invaded Britain. There was no

1217
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,260
more military.

1218
01:22:50,269 --> 01:22:52,470
- Well, okay. On land, yes.

1219
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,100
- There was still the Royal Air Force.

1220
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:56,100
- And the Navy.

1221
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:56,960
- And the Navy, yeah.

1222
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:05,000
- So, invading Britain, I think any invasion of actual Britain is a gigantic

1223
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,909
mistake on the Nazi part, but-

1224
01:23:06,909 --> 01:23:10,180
- But if Britain doesn't have a standing army anymore, it's much easier-

1225
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:10,680
- Well, I-

1226
01:23:10,689 --> 01:23:11,250
- ...than still have one.

1227
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,980
- I think it's still extremely difficult to invade, but it's much easier to sort of

1228
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:21,000
neutralize, make sure that Britain is not a player in the war. I mean, the co-

1229
01:23:21,019 --> 01:23:21,510
mean, the co-

1230
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:24,740
- For sure. Maybe Hitler wouldn't have invaded at all, anyhow.

1231
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:29,540
- Also, because of his sort of, not respect, but non-hatred-

1232
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:29,840
- Right

1233
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,200
- ...of the British Empire.

1234
01:23:31,210 --> 01:23:33,260
- Because they're also white supremacists, so

1235
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,300
...Why would we fight them? You know, it doesn't make sense. While the French, they were already like half

1236
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:40,360
black, basically, in Hitler's eyes.

1237
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,240
- If we're to talk about counterfactual history

1238
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,920
of the possible trajectories of the war that would lead to Nazi victory,

1239
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:56,960
one of the big mistakes is the invasion of Britain. So you already

1240
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:03,500
mentioned the stake with Dunkirk, but beyond that, if they even captured mainland

1241
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:11,370
Europe, they could've just neutralized the British threat and

1242
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,540
not invaded Britain, and then

1243
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:18,040
go after the oil, which is much needed maybe in the Middle

1244
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,360
East. So focus on that campaign before invading the Soviet

1245
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:25,240
Union. And then maybe wait for the Soviet Union to invade them through

1246
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,000
Poland, which would be likely coming, or wait until

1247
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:36,380
1943, something like this, to invade east without the Western front having to be,

1248
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,960
been there. And the other really big mistake is

1249
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:45,340
declaring war against the United States. Having complete disrespect for the United

1250
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:51,960
States and declaring war on the United States. Which didn't have to be done at all.

1251
01:24:52,019 --> 01:24:56,000
So it's collecting enemies when those didn't have to be.

1252
01:24:56,019 --> 01:25:01,300
So there is, to me actually, there's a lot of paths there,

1253
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:07,700
as dark as it is to imagine for Nazi Germany

1254
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:13,140
to be successful in the invasion of the Soviet Union, even.

1255
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,059
- Well, I think that's why the Wehrmacht officers were pissed at Hitler, because they knew that they

1256
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:22,650
could actually win if it was done in a certain way. But Hitler's ideology and his

1257
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:28,956
stupidity... and later also, his degeneration of his cognitive abilities

1258
01:25:30,296 --> 01:25:34,216
did not allow the Wehrmacht to fight in a most effective way.

1259
01:25:34,296 --> 01:25:38,036
Hitler was a very bad leader after Dunkirk.

1260
01:25:38,156 --> 01:25:42,216
- So can you speak to the morphine? What kind of drug is morphine?

1261
01:25:42,956 --> 01:25:47,936
- Morphine was developed in the 19th century by a German, a young chemist called Sertürner.

1262
01:25:47,996 --> 01:25:52,656
A German, a young chemist called Sertürner.

1263
01:25:52,716 --> 01:26:00,276
He wanted to know what the potent alkaloid is in opium. Because opium is a natural drug,

1264
01:26:00,576 --> 01:26:04,276
but there's something in the opium that is actually decisive,

1265
01:26:04,396 --> 01:26:07,916
and that's morphine. So he was able to extract that from the opium.

1266
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:11,896
So he basically, this young guy, invented morphine, which then became

1267
01:26:11,936 --> 01:26:17,476
this young guy, he invented morphine, which then became, you know, very important in wars.

1268
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:22,276
Very important in wars, especially like the American Civil War

1269
01:26:23,176 --> 01:26:27,166
is unthinkable without morphine. Or at least it would have been very different,

1270
01:26:27,176 --> 01:26:31,136
because with morphine, you can treat people, you can amputate people, you can fix people up,

1271
01:26:31,196 --> 01:26:34,786
you can fix people up, and send them back into battle. And that also corresponded with the development

1272
01:26:34,816 --> 01:26:40,196
of the hypodermic needle, the injection needle. Needle, the injection needle.

1273
01:26:41,136 --> 01:26:44,796
That was around in the mid-19th century. So the injection needle and morphine

1274
01:26:44,856 --> 01:26:48,836
together became a very efficient way to treat soldiers.

1275
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:52,556
And that prolonged, for example, the Civil War in America.

1276
01:26:52,616 --> 01:26:54,496
- So Göring was taking morphine.

1277
01:26:54,556 --> 01:26:58,536
- Yeah. Morphine is like the classic. You don't eat opium, you know?

1278
01:26:58,556 --> 01:27:02,536
You don't eat opium, you know? You take what is active in opium,

1279
01:27:02,576 --> 01:27:06,336
and you inject it, and that's a much... That's a very potent... You know,

1280
01:27:06,536 --> 01:27:07,596
potent... You know, that

1281
01:27:08,816 --> 01:27:13,386
numbs all your pain. You don't have pain anymore if you're on morphine. Morphine.

1282
01:27:13,456 --> 01:27:14,946
- It also affects judgment.

1283
01:27:15,016 --> 01:27:21,706
- I've never taken morphine, so I cannot really say. There are a few junkies

1284
01:27:23,496 --> 01:27:27,456
that are highly creative on it. A lot of musicians in the '60s were

1285
01:27:27,536 --> 01:27:31,116
using heroin, which is a more potent form, or it's a half-synthetic. It's an opioid.

1286
01:27:31,196 --> 01:27:34,435
form, or it's a half-synthetic. It's an opioid.

1287
01:27:34,536 --> 01:27:41,796
Morphine is an opiate, and heroin's an opioid. I guess you could be quite sharp on it also.

1288
01:27:43,016 --> 01:27:46,236
That's why Hitler liked Eukodal, which is OxyContin, oxycodone.

1289
01:27:46,776 --> 01:27:52,706
OxyContin, oxycodone. And he injected that.

1290
01:27:52,716 --> 01:27:55,096
- Which is another opiate, heroin-like.

1291
01:27:55,116 --> 01:27:58,836
- It was a product by the Merck company from Darmstadt, Germany.

1292
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:02,496
They made Eukodal, which when Germany lost the war, the patent was

1293
01:28:02,536 --> 01:28:08,756
basically taken by America and then ended up in oxycodone.

1294
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:12,816
So if you inject Eukodal, that was a very popular drug in the '20s.

1295
01:28:13,576 --> 01:28:17,136
Because apparently, it gives you the most beautiful high on Earth.

1296
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:21,756
You're like super high. You feel extremely well,

1297
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:25,576
and you can think very clearly. And you feel like this is how life should feel.

1298
01:28:25,616 --> 01:28:29,416
High on Eukodal, this is like Klaus Mann, the son of Thomas Mann.

1299
01:28:29,436 --> 01:28:33,396
He used Eukodal. Quite a few doctors actually used it also,

1300
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:37,466
and probably quite a few Jewish doctors also used it, because this was like a doctor's drug.

1301
01:28:37,556 --> 01:28:41,476
Doctors knew how to, you know, set the injection.

1302
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:45,396
And it was a great experience. And Hitler, he really loved to be

1303
01:28:45,436 --> 01:28:51,366
on Eukodal. He would use Eukodal every second day. In the beginning, 10 milligrams

1304
01:28:51,476 --> 01:28:55,206
intravenously, then he raised to 20 milligrams. And I

1305
01:28:55,336 --> 01:28:58,136
spoke to someone who's actually done exactly that drug

1306
01:28:58,196 --> 01:29:02,056
application, because I wanted to know how Hitler felt, and I

1307
01:29:02,076 --> 01:29:05,416
didn't feel like doing it myself for some reason. I don't like

1308
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:09,076
needles, so I didn't want to put a needle in my vein to have the Hitler drug

1309
01:29:09,136 --> 01:29:12,746
experience. I should have done it. Like a historian, a proper historian

1310
01:29:12,876 --> 01:29:16,696
never does that, okay? But I thought I should take

1311
01:29:16,766 --> 01:29:20,346
quite a few drugs that I write about to understand it better. But this drug

1312
01:29:20,416 --> 01:29:24,346
I didn't take. I never shot oxycodone intravenously into my veins.

1313
01:29:24,356 --> 01:29:28,256
But I met someone who did, and he said it's like the,

1314
01:29:29,076 --> 01:29:33,016
it's like the king's high. You know, if you do that properly, obviously you get

1315
01:29:33,036 --> 01:29:34,476
addicted to it, you know?

1316
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,456
- I'd be scared to try.

1317
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:37,756
- Very intense experience.

1318
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:41,656
- I think it's a very badass thing to do for a historian, by the way.

1319
01:29:41,716 --> 01:29:45,556
But I think it's a big risk. I think, I mean, there

1320
01:29:45,636 --> 01:29:47,436
is a risk that comes along with it, right?

1321
01:29:47,476 --> 01:29:51,416
- Well, but not for Hitler, because he got the Eukodal from the pharmacy.

1322
01:29:51,436 --> 01:29:55,276
He knew exactly, like his doctor knew exactly what was inside. It was made by

1323
01:29:55,286 --> 01:29:57,536
a pharmaceutical company.

1324
01:29:57,576 --> 01:29:59,736
- No, I mean, the risk of addiction.

1325
01:29:59,776 --> 01:30:04,956
- Yeah, that is a big risk. But there's also the risk of getting impure stuff and-

1326
01:30:05,076 --> 01:30:05,246
- Yes, yes

1327
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:08,756
- like heroin on the street and die from an overdose or... But the

1328
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:12,616
addiction thing is very... I think it happens quite quickly with Eukodal, because it's such a

1329
01:30:12,696 --> 01:30:16,606
great feeling. So why wouldn't you do it over and over again? Because...

1330
01:30:16,636 --> 01:30:18,236
And then the opioid receptors in the brain

1331
01:30:19,736 --> 01:30:23,615
want you to take it. And if you don't take it, you get withdrawal symptoms and you feel

1332
01:30:23,676 --> 01:30:26,976
like shit. And you have to... So that's the problem with opioids, with

1333
01:30:27,036 --> 01:30:31,256
morphine. That's what happens. And that's what happened to Hitler.

1334
01:30:31,336 --> 01:30:39,636
- I generally say yes to most things, but those drugs, like cocaine doesn't scare

1335
01:30:39,696 --> 01:30:45,976
me. Heroin scares me. The opioids scare me. Oxycodone scares me.

1336
01:30:45,986 --> 01:30:49,906
- Because they really make you physically dependent.

1337
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:52,696
I don't even know if cocaine makes you physically dependent. It makes you

1338
01:30:52,716 --> 01:30:54,836
psychologically addicted.

1339
01:30:54,856 --> 01:30:58,226
But you actually have to get it, otherwise you feel bad. That's a

1340
01:30:58,256 --> 01:31:01,026
physical, terrible addiction.

1341
01:31:01,026 --> 01:31:06,356
- And also for life to feel like less when you're not on it. That scares me.

1342
01:31:06,416 --> 01:31:09,676
- That's the problem also with methamphetamine. People who use a lot of methamphetamine,

1343
01:31:10,656 --> 01:31:14,496
on days they don't use it, they don't feel great at all, especially not

1344
01:31:14,536 --> 01:31:18,156
compared to the methamphetamine days. So that became a problem in

1345
01:31:18,196 --> 01:31:22,376
Germany when people were really using more and more of the Pervitin.

1346
01:31:22,396 --> 01:31:26,216
- All right, you got to take me through the full drug cocktail that Hitler was

1347
01:31:26,296 --> 01:31:30,276
on. Patient A of Morell's. Let's start at the

1348
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:34,232
beginning. We're big on setting context here. So tell the

1349
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:39,092
story of Dr. Theodor Morell. How did he meet Hitler?

1350
01:31:39,152 --> 01:31:42,352
- Well, Morell was ... He had his practice on

1351
01:31:42,412 --> 01:31:46,052
Kurfürstendamm, which is like the main boulevard of Berlin, in the west of

1352
01:31:46,092 --> 01:31:53,932
Berlin. Kind of a fancy street. And he was a celebrity doctor,

1353
01:31:53,972 --> 01:31:57,712
which was a new type of doctor, in a way, a Dr. Feelgood. He kind

1354
01:31:57,752 --> 01:32:01,722
of was one of the first Dr. Feelgoods. So you didn't go to him when you had

1355
01:32:01,722 --> 01:32:04,992
a disease. You went to him when you were... Let's say you were an opera

1356
01:32:06,332 --> 01:32:10,072
star in the Berlin Opera, and you had a big premiere, so you would go to Morell

1357
01:32:10,812 --> 01:32:16,922
in the afternoon, and he would give you a nice shot, and then you would, you know, be

1358
01:32:18,172 --> 01:32:21,772
So he... But he was not a quack. I mean, he was... He just knew his

1359
01:32:21,812 --> 01:32:28,592
drugs, and he believed in, you know, why shouldn't you treat someone

1360
01:32:28,632 --> 01:32:30,592
even if that person doesn't have a disease? If you can make

1361
01:32:31,432 --> 01:32:35,232
that person feel better, it's good, especially if that person pays.

1362
01:32:35,252 --> 01:32:39,011
Like, he said, "Everyone who pays my..." And he wasn't cheap. "Who

1363
01:32:39,052 --> 01:32:46,252
comes to me and wants a testosterone hormone injection or a vitamin injection or an

1364
01:32:46,312 --> 01:32:50,072
opioid injection, you get it from him." He didn't have any scruples.

1365
01:32:50,352 --> 01:32:54,312
- I mean, but we should also say, he was pretty innovative and

1366
01:32:54,392 --> 01:32:58,202
extremely knowledgeable. So you mentioned hormones, but also, you

1367
01:32:58,232 --> 01:33:02,252
know, like probiotics. Like, you talk about— Just he knew his shit.

1368
01:33:02,692 --> 01:33:04,792
- He was a bit of a nerd.

1369
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:09,492
- Like, a legit doctor, just didn't have boundaries about what he used.

1370
01:33:09,592 --> 01:33:13,772
- He had a very unappealing physical appearance,

1371
01:33:14,972 --> 01:33:18,492
and I think that was a problem for him, and he was known to have very bad eating

1372
01:33:18,572 --> 01:33:22,082
habits. Like, sauce was running, and... So people were easily

1373
01:33:22,152 --> 01:33:25,472
disgusted by him. He was like an outsider. He was really like a

1374
01:33:25,532 --> 01:33:29,372
freak. But when people looked at him after he had

1375
01:33:29,412 --> 01:33:33,022
given them an injection and they said, "Thank you," and "I feel so great now,"

1376
01:33:33,072 --> 01:33:36,712
that's what kind of made his day, you know? So one

1377
01:33:36,812 --> 01:33:40,352
day, a man entered his doctor's office on

1378
01:33:40,392 --> 01:33:44,052
Kurfürstendamm named Hubertus Hoffmann. And Hube—

1379
01:33:44,092 --> 01:33:51,352
Hubertus Hoffmann was a photographer, and he had gonorrhea. And Morell,

1380
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:57,912
because he knew about alternative ways to treat, he actually cured him.

1381
01:33:58,012 --> 01:34:00,552
And Hubertus Hoffmann said to Morell,

1382
01:34:01,672 --> 01:34:05,412
"I have a good friend, and I think you should meet him, and I'm gonna have a

1383
01:34:05,452 --> 01:34:08,252
dinner in Munich, and I think it would be really worth your time to

1384
01:34:08,352 --> 01:34:12,272
come." And Morell came, and the good friend was Hitler,

1385
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:15,612
because Hubertus Hoffmann was the photographer of Hitler.

1386
01:34:15,632 --> 01:34:19,352
And they were... In German we have a "you," a formal

1387
01:34:19,492 --> 01:34:23,452
you, which is "Sie." Like, if I don't know you so well, I say "Sie."

1388
01:34:23,472 --> 01:34:26,382
And if you're my close friend, I say "du," you.

1389
01:34:26,432 --> 01:34:29,552
And Hitler only had about four people he would say "you" to.

1390
01:34:29,992 --> 01:34:33,632
He would always like the "Sie," like the distance. It was always

1391
01:34:33,692 --> 01:34:37,812
about distance and respect and borders and boundaries.

1392
01:34:37,872 --> 01:34:39,872
- What are the two again? "Sie" and what?

1393
01:34:39,912 --> 01:34:40,592
- "Du."

1394
01:34:40,612 --> 01:34:41,252
- "Sie" and "du"?

1395
01:34:41,292 --> 01:34:44,472
- Yeah. "Sie" is the formal one, and "du" is the informal one.

1396
01:34:44,492 --> 01:34:47,972
- Yeah. In Russian, there's the same thing: "vy" and "ty."

1397
01:34:48,041 --> 01:34:50,712
So there's a big... That's a big thing.

1398
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:54,592
- Also in French, you also have that. You have that in Spanish.

1399
01:34:54,632 --> 01:34:55,352
Only in English you don't have it.

1400
01:34:55,392 --> 01:34:59,312
- And it is part of the cultural sort of discourse,

1401
01:34:59,432 --> 01:35:02,572
of, like, when you upgrade from the "vy"...

1402
01:35:02,592 --> 01:35:02,832
- Right

1403
01:35:03,192 --> 01:35:04,552
- ...to the "ty," from the "Sie" to the "du"...

1404
01:35:04,692 --> 01:35:04,702
- Yeah

1405
01:35:04,702 --> 01:35:06,032
- ...or from the "du" to the "Sie."

1406
01:35:06,092 --> 01:35:07,332
- From the "Sie" to the "du."

1407
01:35:07,372 --> 01:35:07,562
- "Sie" to the "du."

1408
01:35:07,562 --> 01:35:10,152
- That would be the upgrade, because you become more intimate.

1409
01:35:10,212 --> 01:35:12,261
- Yeah, like, and you ask, "Can I go-"

1410
01:35:12,372 --> 01:35:12,502
- Yeah.

1411
01:35:12,502 --> 01:35:13,492
- ...from "Sie" to "du"?"

1412
01:35:13,532 --> 01:35:16,552
- Yeah. Like, the older person must suggest it, I think.

1413
01:35:16,632 --> 01:35:19,252
- Yeah. Okay. Beautiful. Language.

1414
01:35:19,272 --> 01:35:23,352
- So Hoffmann was a "du freund," a "du freund," we say,

1415
01:35:24,292 --> 01:35:28,232
of Hitler. So he was quite close to Hitler, and that's why he could also make

1416
01:35:28,252 --> 01:35:31,992
that close connection. So he had a dinner with just him, Hitler, Eva

1417
01:35:32,092 --> 01:35:36,012
Braun, Hitler's girlfriend, and Morell came. They sent a plane to

1418
01:35:36,052 --> 01:35:40,632
Berlin to pick him up, so it's like VIP treatment. It was- ...the whole thing.

1419
01:35:40,692 --> 01:35:42,892
- And this is 1936?

1420
01:35:42,902 --> 01:35:46,782
- '36. Yeah, they had spaghetti with tomato sauce on the side, I read in

1421
01:35:46,792 --> 01:35:50,772
the... There's like a description of this event. The tomato

1422
01:35:50,832 --> 01:35:58,412
sauce was on the side. And there was Muscat. What is Muscat? It's a spice. Nutmeg.

1423
01:35:58,492 --> 01:35:58,932
- Nutmeg.

1424
01:35:58,952 --> 01:36:02,352
- Yeah, it was with nutmeg, which is an unusual recipe, I guess, but that's what they

1425
01:36:02,392 --> 01:36:06,132
had. And spaghetti wasn't a fancy thing, you know? It came from

1426
01:36:06,192 --> 01:36:10,052
Italy, from Mussolini, who invented fascism in Italy, and who

1427
01:36:10,112 --> 01:36:13,792
was like Hitler's role model for a long time until Hitler surpassed him,

1428
01:36:13,832 --> 01:36:17,752
obviously. So the spaghetti that came from Italy, and it

1429
01:36:17,792 --> 01:36:20,412
was a big thing. And Morell had the big problem

1430
01:36:21,312 --> 01:36:24,412
that spaghetti's hard to eat, right? And he couldn't even like it. It was a

1431
01:36:24,452 --> 01:36:28,152
It was a catastrophe. But he got out of it because

1432
01:36:28,172 --> 01:36:31,792
Hitler complained about stomach problems cause Hitler was a

1433
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:35,692
terrible vegetarian. He was a so-called cake vegetarian. He would

1434
01:36:35,772 --> 01:36:39,082
only eat sweets, like cake. No meat of course, but he wouldn't

1435
01:36:39,112 --> 01:36:43,082
eat healthy stuff, you know? So he was bloated the whole

1436
01:36:43,112 --> 01:36:46,722
time, because he only ate cake and white bread, and it's not

1437
01:36:46,732 --> 01:36:50,632
good. So he voiced that, and there was also

1438
01:36:50,832 --> 01:36:54,732
a Brandt was there, like his official doctor from the SS that was

1439
01:36:54,792 --> 01:36:58,672
his doctor, and Hitler said, "My

1440
01:36:58,692 --> 01:37:06,112
doctors can't cure me." And Morell was like, "This is my chance. Thank you, God."

1441
01:37:06,212 --> 01:37:10,072
And he told Hitler about the probiotics, which Hitler had never

1442
01:37:10,112 --> 01:37:14,032
heard of. And also Brandt, the doctor, he hadn't heard of, because that was a new thing that

1443
01:37:14,072 --> 01:37:17,472
you give. And he- Hitler was asking, "What is that?" And Morell

1444
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:24,632
said, "These are live bacteria from German soldiers from the

1445
01:37:24,812 --> 01:37:28,752
war in the First World War that were fighting in Serbia." There was one

1446
01:37:28,772 --> 01:37:32,712
guy who didn't get the stomach flu when all the others, like, drank

1447
01:37:32,752 --> 01:37:36,662
the water in Serbia and all got sick. But this one guy, so his bacteria... And this is

1448
01:37:36,692 --> 01:37:40,592
a true story. His gut bacteria were cultivated

1449
01:37:40,652 --> 01:37:44,592
into a medicine called Mutaflor. And Morell told Hitler

1450
01:37:44,652 --> 01:37:48,422
about this and he said, "This is amazing. I have to try this," you know? And it

1451
01:37:48,422 --> 01:37:52,192
helped, you know? He got the Mutaflor, he did the Mutaflor kind of

1452
01:37:52,232 --> 01:37:55,812
therapy and it cured him. He suddenly had no bloating

1453
01:37:55,852 --> 01:37:59,831
anymore, and the farting of Hitler was really bad. So bad that he'd-

1454
01:37:59,871 --> 01:38:04,192
it would, like, diminish his

1455
01:38:05,432 --> 01:38:09,062
ability to work, you know? So suddenly he could work. He said he felt better.

1456
01:38:09,072 --> 01:38:13,052
He didn't have the pain. He felt great, so he really thought that

1457
01:38:13,092 --> 01:38:16,952
Morell is a wonder doctor. And he asked Morell pretty quickly

1458
01:38:17,032 --> 01:38:23,411
afterwards, "Do you want to be my personal physician?" And Morell's

1459
01:38:23,512 --> 01:38:27,212
wife was very much against it because she said, "If you become the personal physician of

1460
01:38:27,232 --> 01:38:31,172
Hitler, you won't have any time for me anymore." And he said like, "Come

1461
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:35,212
on, man. This is the chance you only get once in your life."

1462
01:38:35,251 --> 01:38:37,751
- Yeah, I mean, at this point, Hitler's a really big deal.

1463
01:38:37,972 --> 01:38:40,392
- He's the most powerful man in Europe.

1464
01:38:40,452 --> 01:38:44,352
And there have not been war crimes 'cause the war

1465
01:38:44,371 --> 01:38:48,352
hasn't started yet. Obviously there's concentration camps and a

1466
01:38:48,392 --> 01:38:52,132
lot of crimes have been committed, but it's also kind of hushed

1467
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:55,842
up, you know? It was... it's not such a huge thing

1468
01:38:56,032 --> 01:39:02,212
as now we know it became. So, Morell never really has any

1469
01:39:02,852 --> 01:39:06,732
conscientious problems. He just thought it's great, you know. "I'm going to be the doctor.

1470
01:39:06,772 --> 01:39:10,992
I'm going to be part of history." So he becomes the personal physician, and

1471
01:39:12,612 --> 01:39:16,371
being this vitamin guy, like vitamins were really his thing. He believed

1472
01:39:16,772 --> 01:39:20,192
in the power of vitamins. And today I think we know that he was

1473
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:23,472
right. Vitamins are good, but back then, no one

1474
01:39:23,552 --> 01:39:27,512
knew. And Hitler was like, "Okay." He told Hitler, and then

1475
01:39:27,532 --> 01:39:31,482
Hitler said, "Okay, I want to try these vitamins and..."

1476
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:35,512
what they did from the beginning was injections because Hitler didn't want to take a pill, 'cause the pill

1477
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:39,411
takes too long and it goes through the- the track that he

1478
01:39:39,452 --> 01:39:43,132
has the problems with, like the digestion. Like he didn't want to take a pill. He

1479
01:39:43,432 --> 01:39:47,191
believed in the injection, and Morell was the masterful

1480
01:39:47,691 --> 01:39:51,212
injector. So Morell, because the needles were thicker than they are

1481
01:39:51,251 --> 01:39:55,032
today, but Morell could give you an injection without you

1482
01:39:55,092 --> 01:39:58,972
feeling any pain. So Hitler was quite impressed, so he got like a vitamin C injection, but Hitler loved the daily

1483
01:39:59,012 --> 01:40:02,592
so he got like a vitamin C injection, but Hitler loved the daily injection, so he got hooked on the daily

1484
01:40:02,632 --> 01:40:05,432
injection, so he got hooked on the daily injection. Once he got the injection, the day was good.

1485
01:40:05,492 --> 01:40:09,541
injection. Once he got the injection, the day was good.

1486
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:13,452
And he never got sick, actually. And he could stand like for a long time with the arm raised. He did, he went to the gym, basically.

1487
01:40:13,612 --> 01:40:17,572
arm raised. He did, he went to the gym, basically. I mean, he had a gym where he was doing exercise so he could have his arm up

1488
01:40:17,612 --> 01:40:21,552
mean, he had a gym where he was doing exercise so he could have his arm up for like hours when a military parade would walk by. So he was quite fit and he

1489
01:40:21,612 --> 01:40:25,512
for like hours when a military parade would walk by. So he was quite fit and he was never sick and Morell was giving him the daily injection and

1490
01:40:25,552 --> 01:40:28,420
was never sick and Morell was giving him the daily injection and they lived happily ever after, basically, until the Soviet Union attacked.

1491
01:40:29,552 --> 01:40:34,432
they- they lived happily ever after basically until the Soviet Union attacked.

1492
01:40:34,472 --> 01:40:38,212
- Wait, wait, wait. He literally lifted so he could do the Heil Hitler salute?

1493
01:40:38,652 --> 01:40:39,331
salute?

1494
01:40:39,392 --> 01:40:42,871
- Yeah, I found a document for that. That's funny. Oh God, that's dark.

1495
01:40:42,932 --> 01:40:45,331
- That's funny. Oh God, that's dark.

1496
01:40:45,371 --> 01:40:49,512
- He had an expander, we say. I don't know, do you use that word in English? Expander? Oh, like a band.

1497
01:40:49,612 --> 01:40:51,472
- Oh, like a- a band.

1498
01:40:51,492 --> 01:40:52,862
- Yeah, it's like this. You do like... Yeah, yeah, I have one of those.

1499
01:40:52,892 --> 01:40:54,272
- Yeah, yeah, I have one of those.

1500
01:40:54,331 --> 01:40:55,302
- Yeah, that's what, that's what- Wow.

1501
01:40:55,312 --> 01:40:55,512
- Wow.

1502
01:40:55,532 --> 01:40:57,121
- That's what he did. In front of the- And I do those kinds of exercises.

1503
01:40:57,121 --> 01:40:58,092
- And I do those kinds of exercises.

1504
01:40:58,102 --> 01:41:00,251
- ...in front of the window. Well, at least he's not doing it in front of a mirror. Okay, wow, that's dark.

1505
01:41:00,291 --> 01:41:03,772
- Well, at least he's not doing it in front of a mirror. Okay, wow, that's dark.

1506
01:41:03,852 --> 01:41:07,251
Okay. That's... I mean, those little details, yet another reminder that he's just a human being.

1507
01:41:07,632 --> 01:41:11,492
yet another reminder that he's just a human being.

1508
01:41:11,532 --> 01:41:15,492
- I mean, it's hard to keep your arm up for like hours. You can't let it down. If you keep it up, that's what it's all about, you know?

1509
01:41:15,612 --> 01:41:18,291
keep it up, that's what it's all about, you know?

1510
01:41:18,331 --> 01:41:21,272
- I mean, he was very much about the façade, right? It's very important to present himself in a certain kind of way when he's giving the speeches.

1511
01:41:21,972 --> 01:41:26,012
important to present himself in a certain kind of way when he's giving the speeches.

1512
01:41:26,052 --> 01:41:29,871
- Yeah, it was, everything was orchestrated. The Nazis were masters in propaganda. They really knew how to create the perfect image.

1513
01:41:29,972 --> 01:41:34,972
propaganda. They really knew how to create the perfect image.

1514
01:41:35,092 --> 01:41:38,272
- Okay, so let's go into the cocktail. It started with the vitamins. This is in '36.

1515
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:41,112
vitamins. This is in '36.

1516
01:41:41,152 --> 01:41:45,062
- Right. I think it was pretty harmless in the beginning. Mm-hmm.

1517
01:41:45,112 --> 01:41:49,072
Just the addiction to the injection was the main thing that I think happened, that Hitler needed his doctor. But from '36 to '41, only

1518
01:41:49,112 --> 01:41:57,132
happened, that Hitler needed his doctor. But from '36 to '41, only like vitamins are being injected and glucose.

1519
01:41:57,192 --> 01:41:59,572
vitamins are being injected and glucose,

1520
01:42:00,772 --> 01:42:04,331
So I don't think it really harms you. I mean, it might benefit you. He never got sick. He was fit.

1521
01:42:04,432 --> 01:42:06,951
you. He never got sick. He was fit.

1522
01:42:06,972 --> 01:42:08,882
- This, I mean, this is the thing that... That was phase one of his drug use, the vitamins, until '41.

1523
01:42:08,882 --> 01:42:12,412
- That was phase one of his drug use were the vitamins, until '41.

1524
01:42:12,451 --> 01:42:16,102
- So, you think the tweaking at the Olympics, you've talked about before but still, so you're saying this person-

1525
01:42:16,451 --> 01:42:20,072
before but still, so you're saying this person-

1526
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:23,632
...we're watching a video of here, is not on drugs. I don't know. I don't think so.

1527
01:42:23,712 --> 01:42:25,871
- I don't know. I don't think so.

1528
01:42:26,512 --> 01:42:27,901
- So the- the video could be faked.

1529
01:42:27,912 --> 01:42:28,022
- There are no records.

1530
01:42:28,022 --> 01:42:29,032
- It could be sped up.

1531
01:42:29,112 --> 01:42:32,812
- I think it's fake, because I think someone read my book that Hitler was

1532
01:42:32,871 --> 01:42:36,912
on, thought that Hitler was always on meth and created this. But I might be wrong.

1533
01:42:36,922 --> 01:42:40,831
- Yeah, and the narrative takes hold, and I think the thing you mentioned, he could

1534
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,692
be on sugar, so it could be a lot of elements.

1535
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:46,922
- He was also a weird guy. Maybe he was really just rocking...

1536
01:42:46,922 --> 01:42:48,782
...because he was so happy with what he saw, you know?

1537
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:52,612
Maybe he really got into it. Maybe it was a sexual thing for him, what he saw. I don't know.

1538
01:42:52,652 --> 01:42:57,352
There's no document showing that he took a drug on that day, let's put it that way.

1539
01:42:57,392 --> 01:43:03,572
- I think I've been, especially, like, stay up all night, I'll get fidgety.

1540
01:43:03,592 --> 01:43:07,512
You can just be caught in a certain moment when you're being very like...

1541
01:43:07,592 --> 01:43:08,822
...like fidgety.

1542
01:43:08,951 --> 01:43:12,722
- I think he probably rocked a few times, and then the video was cut in a way...

1543
01:43:12,732 --> 01:43:16,192
...that he rocks more or something. Also, methamphetamine wasn't yet

1544
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:18,092
available in 1936. So...

1545
01:43:18,112 --> 01:43:19,451
- That's important to say.

1546
01:43:19,472 --> 01:43:23,412
- ...for sure he was not. So, what is said here,

1547
01:43:23,492 --> 01:43:28,172
on Hitler tweaking on meth at the 1936 Olympics, is definitely false.

1548
01:43:28,212 --> 01:43:31,772
- Okay. There you go. So when did it start getting more

1549
01:43:31,852 --> 01:43:37,251
serious? The injection and the kind of drugs he was taking?

1550
01:43:37,262 --> 01:43:41,772
- This was a day in August of 1941. Germany had

1551
01:43:43,112 --> 01:43:49,276
invaded the Soviet Union on June 22nd. So this is about six

1552
01:43:49,335 --> 01:43:56,606
weeks into the campaign, which was called Unternehmen Barbarossa. And Germany was

1553
01:43:56,635 --> 01:44:00,415
doing pretty well, and it came to a crucial

1554
01:44:00,476 --> 01:44:02,976
moment where High Command said, "Now we're going to take

1555
01:44:03,016 --> 01:44:06,835
Moscow." And Hitler said, "No, we're going to

1556
01:44:06,896 --> 01:44:10,576
split up the troops and take Leningrad," which is now Saint

1557
01:44:10,635 --> 01:44:13,936
Petersburg in the north, and in the south, we're going to go for

1558
01:44:13,996 --> 01:44:17,656
the, for the oil fields, basically. That was his plan. He

1559
01:44:17,755 --> 01:44:21,146
said, "Let's not do Moscow." And High Command was

1560
01:44:21,175 --> 01:44:24,786
like, "This is the biggest mistake. We must take Moscow. If

1561
01:44:24,835 --> 01:44:32,536
we, if we take Moscow, we're going to win." And Hitler became ill for the first time

1562
01:44:33,996 --> 01:44:37,856
on the day this decision was made. I mean, this is a dynamic thing that's going on, you

1563
01:44:37,896 --> 01:44:41,875
know? They're moving, and now they have to decide, "Will we split up or will we continue

1564
01:44:41,896 --> 01:44:45,856
towards Moscow?" And he had the Russian flu, in

1565
01:44:45,896 --> 01:44:49,755
German, the Ruhr, which is a like a flu-type disease with

1566
01:44:49,835 --> 01:44:53,776
very high fever. It comes... Like, they were in the field, like so, they were in the

1567
01:44:53,856 --> 01:44:57,715
east, you know, camping out. Maybe he drank water that wasn't

1568
01:44:57,755 --> 01:45:01,616
good or he had some, you know, they tested everything meticulously, but he

1569
01:45:01,656 --> 01:45:05,635
got, you know, he got sick. High fever, he felt like shit,

1570
01:45:06,396 --> 01:45:10,255
and he said to Morell... And, you know, you can see it in Morell's notes.

1571
01:45:10,316 --> 01:45:13,936
Like Morell describes this very vividly in his notes, which are at the Federal

1572
01:45:14,036 --> 01:45:17,915
Archives which no historian ever, ever looked

1573
01:45:17,936 --> 01:45:21,795
at, except me, the non-historian, which is kind of funny. So,

1574
01:45:22,135 --> 01:45:25,896
he describes how Hitler then asks of him,

1575
01:45:26,476 --> 01:45:30,036
basically says, "Vitamins are not enough anymore." Like he's very

1576
01:45:30,156 --> 01:45:37,715
weak. He must, he must go to the military. Briefing, but the flu is quite a severe

1577
01:45:37,736 --> 01:45:41,536
disease, I think. If you have a heavy flu, you really feel like you're

1578
01:45:41,576 --> 01:45:45,246
going to die, you can't go to a military briefing. But Morell

1579
01:45:45,276 --> 01:45:50,456
kind of fought with himself, and then he decided to inject an opioid

1580
01:45:51,276 --> 01:45:55,186
into Hitler's veins intravenously, like the strongest application possible. And

1581
01:45:55,215 --> 01:46:01,135
this was Dolantine, which is a German opioid that was legal. And

1582
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:09,036
I was once an exchange student in Flint, Michigan, 1988, and I was number one of the

1583
01:46:09,056 --> 01:46:11,696
tennis team because I was quite a good tennis player.

1584
01:46:11,736 --> 01:46:15,675
We were playing our main enemy. I think I was

1585
01:46:15,715 --> 01:46:19,656
at Flint Powers Catholic High School in Flint, Michigan, and I think

1586
01:46:19,696 --> 01:46:24,436
it was Powers Central, and they had a number one, Marc Resstiner.

1587
01:46:24,536 --> 01:46:25,976
- Still remember, wow.

1588
01:46:26,036 --> 01:46:30,156
- He was feared. And no one could beat him.

1589
01:46:30,236 --> 01:46:30,755
- Yes.

1590
01:46:31,255 --> 01:46:35,116
- And on the day of the match, I had the Russian flu, basically.

1591
01:46:35,175 --> 01:46:38,556
And I was the hope, I was the number one, the wonder kid from

1592
01:46:38,596 --> 01:46:41,835
Germany. And they took me to a doctor,

1593
01:46:42,956 --> 01:46:46,705
and the doctor gave me an injection. I don't know until this day because I was a

1594
01:46:47,496 --> 01:46:51,596
kid, I got the injection, I was 17, and I felt great.

1595
01:46:52,596 --> 01:46:56,576
The flu was gone like this. It was probably an opioid,

1596
01:46:56,616 --> 01:47:00,496
something that just shuts off all the pain and gives

1597
01:47:00,576 --> 01:47:03,936
you energy. And I beat this guy.

1598
01:47:04,295 --> 01:47:11,436
in a way I totally thought of a new technique by playing very

1599
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:19,476
high balls. In the direct, fierceful competition, I would have lost, so I played

1600
01:47:19,536 --> 01:47:23,516
something that in Germany we call "Lüddeln," which is something you don't really do.

1601
01:47:23,536 --> 01:47:24,726
You just play high balls.

1602
01:47:24,726 --> 01:47:25,215
- Lobbying, yeah, yeah.

1603
01:47:25,736 --> 01:47:29,576
- which is not pretty to look at, but it's very effective. And he

1604
01:47:29,616 --> 01:47:33,215
just lost his nerve, and I beat him like 6-0,

1605
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:38,915
6-0, something like that. Sensational. So Hitler receives this

1606
01:47:39,835 --> 01:47:43,675
Dolantine injection, and he gets up, he goes into the meeting

1607
01:47:43,755 --> 01:47:47,556
room, he dominates the meeting room, he feels great.

1608
01:47:47,635 --> 01:47:51,576
He decides, in front of everybody, no one is able to overpower him in that meeting.

1609
01:47:51,696 --> 01:47:55,295
He was very good in the room. And the troops are split up.

1610
01:47:55,335 --> 01:47:59,276
Leningrad is now a target. This weakens the general thrust towards Moscow.

1611
01:47:59,295 --> 01:48:03,675
This weakens the general thrust towards Moscow.

1612
01:48:03,736 --> 01:48:07,696
This is probably why they didn't take Moscow. They probably could have taken

1613
01:48:07,736 --> 01:48:11,415
it, or maybe not. But the decision was made in August to-

1614
01:48:11,696 --> 01:48:14,875
- I think it's one of the biggest blunders of the Eastern Front.

1615
01:48:14,885 --> 01:48:15,776
- To not take Moscow.

1616
01:48:15,816 --> 01:48:18,446
- To not take Moscow. I think they had a straight shot given the-

1617
01:48:18,446 --> 01:48:18,526
- Right

1618
01:48:18,556 --> 01:48:20,096
- ...disorganization.

1619
01:48:20,135 --> 01:48:23,385
- They had the one-time thing, the one-time moment where they could have done

1620
01:48:23,415 --> 01:48:27,056
it. And the German war machine could only win in so-called

1621
01:48:27,175 --> 01:48:31,066
speed wars like lightning war. Only if they would do it very fast and

1622
01:48:31,135 --> 01:48:34,885
surprise, because they were always weaker, basically. They just had this moment, this

1623
01:48:34,896 --> 01:48:38,596
dynamic moment, and this was fueled by the methamphetamine. Also, in the

1624
01:48:38,635 --> 01:48:42,316
Soviet Union, hundreds of millions of dosages were given, so the

1625
01:48:42,356 --> 01:48:46,276
Germans were really going. And at one point, this ends, you

1626
01:48:46,316 --> 01:48:50,135
know? You can't take meth for the rest of your life. You're just going to end up being a

1627
01:48:50,196 --> 01:48:54,175
nervous wreck. But you can do it for like two months. You could do it, but then

1628
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:55,175
it stops.

1629
01:48:55,236 --> 01:48:57,616
- I think if you're really honest about where

1630
01:48:58,596 --> 01:49:02,316
you have the asymmetry of power, which is in the

1631
01:49:02,516 --> 01:49:06,436
speed of the Blitzkrieg. So that's similar to Genghis Khan, who had

1632
01:49:06,556 --> 01:49:10,436
a very small military, but their advantage

1633
01:49:10,496 --> 01:49:17,295
was, I mean, I think at the peak it would be probably 100,000.

1634
01:49:17,556 --> 01:49:21,606
And every soldier of Genghis Khan's had five horses. So the-

1635
01:49:22,375 --> 01:49:22,486
- Right

1636
01:49:22,536 --> 01:49:26,366
- ...the whole point was they can move really fast. They, they,

1637
01:49:26,415 --> 01:49:30,255
and they, not just fast, but they can move on all terrain, so they can

1638
01:49:30,316 --> 01:49:34,236
go around. You know, if wars were fought on normal roads, you're supposed to travel a

1639
01:49:34,255 --> 01:49:42,206
certain kind of way. If you go fast and around, not on paths that are usually

1640
01:49:42,236 --> 01:49:46,085
taken, attack from all kinds of sides, that's why you can

1641
01:49:46,116 --> 01:49:50,036
conquer as much as Genghis Khan was able to conquer. And the same thing with the Nazi

1642
01:49:50,156 --> 01:49:54,045
forces, this is their biggest advantage. And not using

1643
01:49:54,215 --> 01:49:59,306
that is essentially the end of its effectiveness.

1644
01:49:59,386 --> 01:50:02,346
- I think that's also why the tank troops were such a good

1645
01:50:02,526 --> 01:50:05,566
weapon, because they can go off-road

1646
01:50:06,406 --> 01:50:10,306
while military vehicles, cars, cannot do it. Like a tank

1647
01:50:10,366 --> 01:50:14,245
can even go through a forest and just, you know, kill small trees and just run

1648
01:50:14,346 --> 01:50:17,846
over it. So those are kind of the five

1649
01:50:17,886 --> 01:50:21,186
horses that was the idea they had at this working

1650
01:50:21,266 --> 01:50:25,186
breakfast. That's what they presented to Hitler. "We're going to use the tank force in a very different

1651
01:50:25,246 --> 01:50:29,335
way, and that's going to enable us to win the lightning war of campaigns."

1652
01:50:29,366 --> 01:50:34,586
- Was that one of the first times he tried an opiate like that? An intense one?

1653
01:50:34,646 --> 01:50:36,186
- That was the first time.

1654
01:50:36,206 --> 01:50:38,055
- And then that was it for him? He loved it?

1655
01:50:38,066 --> 01:50:41,586
- Well, not immediately. You can see when you study

1656
01:50:41,646 --> 01:50:45,546
his medications, that that is the turning point

1657
01:50:45,586 --> 01:50:49,526
in a way, that now he deviates from the

1658
01:50:49,566 --> 01:50:52,656
vitamins. He becomes more interested in what's out

1659
01:50:52,686 --> 01:50:56,486
there. And from '41 to '43, he tries

1660
01:50:56,546 --> 01:51:00,386
out a lot of medications that he didn't try out before. Before

1661
01:51:00,446 --> 01:51:04,366
that, it was quite conventional, mostly vitamins and glucose.

1662
01:51:04,386 --> 01:51:08,346
But now he becomes experimental, and he discusses this

1663
01:51:08,386 --> 01:51:12,136
with Morell. And Morell is also very experimental. They really

1664
01:51:12,526 --> 01:51:20,246
nerded themselves into, like, "What can we use?" Like, bull's testicle extracts. So,

1665
01:51:20,286 --> 01:51:27,766
Morell, in order to present those things to his patient A, he created a

1666
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:30,246
pharmaceutical company

1667
01:51:31,506 --> 01:51:35,486
that he ran. So he was the personal physician of Hitler, and he

1668
01:51:35,526 --> 01:51:39,326
was also the CEO of Hammer Pharmaceuticals, which had

1669
01:51:39,366 --> 01:51:43,276
its production site in occupied Czechoslovakia. And

1670
01:51:44,706 --> 01:51:49,686
for example, at one point, when Germany had invaded the Ukraine, Morell

1671
01:51:50,706 --> 01:51:57,746
asked for a monopoly for all the organs of all the slaughtered animals from all the

1672
01:51:57,866 --> 01:52:01,706
slaughterhouses in the Ukraine. So, this was a huge logistical

1673
01:52:01,826 --> 01:52:05,686
operation. All the slaughtered animals, all the organs were

1674
01:52:05,746 --> 01:52:13,126
removed for the personal physician of the Führer, sent in military trains back to

1675
01:52:13,186 --> 01:52:17,026
the factory in occupied Czechoslovakia. And

1676
01:52:17,066 --> 01:52:20,766
the military became really upset with that, because they said, "We need our

1677
01:52:20,806 --> 01:52:23,615
trains to transport back our wounded soldiers." Now there are

1678
01:52:24,726 --> 01:52:28,496
cars full of offal and pigs' hearts and

1679
01:52:28,526 --> 01:52:32,226
pigs' livers, and it was totally bizarre. And

1680
01:52:32,286 --> 01:52:35,866
Morell, but Morell then became, he was this

1681
01:52:35,906 --> 01:52:39,866
good-natured Dr. Feelgood in the beginning, and then when the Ukraine was occupied,

1682
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:46,866
he became just like, a business freak who made a lot of money with his dubious

1683
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:50,906
hormonal concoctions, where he would threaten

1684
01:52:50,946 --> 01:52:54,335
the army. "If you don't let the train with

1685
01:52:54,466 --> 01:52:58,156
my raw materials go to my factory, I will tell

1686
01:52:58,206 --> 01:53:01,536
Hitler and you will have a problem." He was acting like that.

1687
01:53:02,226 --> 01:53:06,126
He became quite an asshole, actually. And a

1688
01:53:06,186 --> 01:53:09,796
war criminal, because he also, at his factory where he would

1689
01:53:09,866 --> 01:53:13,346
make the famous pig liver extract

1690
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:17,606
that was then tested by Hitler, and Hitler said, "That's a good medication.

1691
01:53:17,666 --> 01:53:21,546
I feel more, I have more energy. So, this can also be sold to

1692
01:53:21,586 --> 01:53:25,466
the German military." That's how it worked, because the regulations

1693
01:53:25,526 --> 01:53:29,366
at the time were, that it was very difficult to bring out a new

1694
01:53:29,406 --> 01:53:33,386
medication onto the market. Because medications, to bring them onto the

1695
01:53:33,446 --> 01:53:37,266
market, you need certain test phases and all of that stuff. So, that's

1696
01:53:37,306 --> 01:53:41,186
hard to do in a war, especially in World War II. So, Hitler

1697
01:53:41,306 --> 01:53:45,066
said to Morell, "I'm going to be your guinea pig. You just make

1698
01:53:45,126 --> 01:53:48,486
it in your factory, I test it, and if I think it's

1699
01:53:48,546 --> 01:53:51,906
good, then I'm just going to write a..." Today, you would say, like, a

1700
01:53:51,986 --> 01:53:55,926
decree. "Because I'm the President, you know, I can order it that it's

1701
01:53:55,946 --> 01:53:57,996
going to be legal all over Germany."

1702
01:53:58,046 --> 01:54:01,986
- So, Hitler was a real drug guy. He liked drugs.

1703
01:54:02,006 --> 01:54:07,606
- Well, he liked to experiment, I would say, with drugs and with

1704
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:11,066
Morell. They never... He was against drugs, you know? He was-

1705
01:54:11,086 --> 01:54:14,466
- But that's a crazy thing for a guy who didn't do anything, right?

1706
01:54:14,546 --> 01:54:21,106
- It's a big contradiction, or it's a big irony, or it's very weird.

1707
01:54:21,126 --> 01:54:23,886
- But isn't it even a bit of a mystery? Because, at that

1708
01:54:23,986 --> 01:54:26,526
stage, I'm sure he was paranoid

1709
01:54:26,966 --> 01:54:30,726
about being killed and all that kind of stuff. So, he must have really trusted

1710
01:54:30,766 --> 01:54:31,536
Morell, right?

1711
01:54:31,586 --> 01:54:35,476
- Yeah, he trusted Morell, because Morell was not part of any organization. He was

1712
01:54:35,506 --> 01:54:39,406
the loner coming from the VIP doctors, his own

1713
01:54:39,466 --> 01:54:43,006
VIP doctor's office, and now he was basically Hitler's toy. Hitler could

1714
01:54:43,806 --> 01:54:47,786
get access to all kinds of medications through him, and Morell would never

1715
01:54:47,906 --> 01:54:51,806
say it to anybody, you know? He would just write it down. But this was

1716
01:54:51,866 --> 01:54:54,755
kept quite secret. No one knew what was going on between the two men.

1717
01:54:54,755 --> 01:54:58,336
- See, it's just so interesting, because why would he? There might

1718
01:54:58,366 --> 01:55:02,266
be... Can you maybe even speak to that? Why

1719
01:55:02,346 --> 01:55:06,255
did Hitler trust another human being this much? Because

1720
01:55:06,366 --> 01:55:10,946
you could probably make the case nobody was closer to Hitler than Morell.

1721
01:55:10,966 --> 01:55:13,686
- That is- that is certainly the story I'm telling.

1722
01:55:13,726 --> 01:55:17,346
- Isn't that crazy? Like, what is it about Morell? This guy

1723
01:55:17,406 --> 01:55:25,266
who's... He's- I guess he's fat and weird, and, like, Nobody really likes him.

1724
01:55:26,306 --> 01:55:29,966
- He was not a threat to Hitler. Like, Hitler hated

1725
01:55:30,746 --> 01:55:34,686
all the super smart medicine people. Like, he didn't- he never

1726
01:55:35,186 --> 01:55:38,026
undressed before them. He never let himself be seen

1727
01:55:38,086 --> 01:55:41,846
naked, 'cause he didn't want anyone to know anything, you know,

1728
01:55:42,046 --> 01:55:45,846
about him that he couldn't control. So, Morell was harmless.

1729
01:55:45,906 --> 01:55:49,746
Morell would- basically did what Hitler wanted. They wouldn't say, "We're gonna

1730
01:55:49,786 --> 01:55:53,636
take- today we're gonna take drugs together. It's gonna be fun." You know, Hitler was always

1731
01:55:53,766 --> 01:55:57,726
about optimizing his performance, because he knew, "Only I'm

1732
01:55:57,826 --> 01:56:01,762
doing this. I have to..." And he always thought he's

1733
01:56:01,802 --> 01:56:05,362
gonna die young, so he always like, "I don't have unlimited

1734
01:56:05,422 --> 01:56:09,382
time. The, the, the clock was always ticking, so I have to

1735
01:56:09,442 --> 01:56:15,202
be always the high performer." So Hitler, when he first experienced

1736
01:56:17,202 --> 01:56:21,162
the beauty of the opioid high that was given

1737
01:56:21,182 --> 01:56:24,722
to him in August 1941 intravenously, when he experienced

1738
01:56:24,732 --> 01:56:28,652
that, kind of his eyes opened. And he didn't think this was a,

1739
01:56:28,742 --> 01:56:32,661
drug. I mean, this is a medicine. This is a medicine that helps me function.

1740
01:56:32,682 --> 01:56:36,531
This is a medicine that my doctor gives me in a very controlled

1741
01:56:36,642 --> 01:56:40,162
manner, and that lets me be extremely

1742
01:56:40,302 --> 01:56:44,142
sharp for, like, eight hours. I can convince all the generals. I can do my job. I'm

1743
01:56:44,202 --> 01:56:47,262
happy. Because Hitler was also depressed, you know? I mean, this is,

1744
01:56:47,322 --> 01:56:51,202
uh... He need- he need... Like, he really

1745
01:56:51,212 --> 01:56:55,192
appreciated what the drug gave him, but he never thought, "Now I'm

1746
01:56:55,222 --> 01:56:56,991
becoming, like, a drug addict," or...

1747
01:56:57,022 --> 01:57:00,752
- So it begins to, oxycodone in general, begins to work within 30 to

1748
01:57:00,842 --> 01:57:06,162
60 minutes, and lasts for about four to six hours. This is a long-lasting thing.

1749
01:57:06,202 --> 01:57:10,192
- Yeah, but these are, this, this you swallow. If you get an intravenous injection, it works after

1750
01:57:10,242 --> 01:57:11,342
one second.

1751
01:57:11,352 --> 01:57:11,542
- Wow.

1752
01:57:11,582 --> 01:57:13,482
- Get the injection, you're high, but that-

1753
01:57:13,492 --> 01:57:15,172
- But it lasts for many hours.

1754
01:57:15,302 --> 01:57:19,242
- Yeah. That's why people love heroin, who take it, because you feel like

1755
01:57:19,302 --> 01:57:22,362
shit, you take the injection, you feel great. I mean, it's in your

1756
01:57:23,042 --> 01:57:26,922
system for quite a while. Like, you can go into the meeting quite comfortably.

1757
01:57:28,162 --> 01:57:30,172
- Into the meeting. Yeah, okay.

1758
01:57:30,222 --> 01:57:34,132
- I mean, there's the briefing. It starts at 1:00. Morell comes, and you can see this

1759
01:57:34,182 --> 01:57:37,382
in the notes. Like, "I have to be at the Führer's bedroom at

1760
01:57:37,422 --> 01:57:41,312
12:00." And then, you know, you chat a bit, and then Hitler rolls up

1761
01:57:41,342 --> 01:57:44,502
his uniform sleeve, and then he gets the injection maybe at

1762
01:57:45,322 --> 01:57:49,092
maybe 12:30. Then the high comes on, and then it's very

1763
01:57:49,162 --> 01:57:56,542
stable. Like, you feel great. This is a pure product from the Merck company.

1764
01:57:56,582 --> 01:58:00,482
This is not some heroin from the street. And Morell knows exactly what

1765
01:58:00,502 --> 01:58:04,132
dosage you want right now, so you feel at the top of your

1766
01:58:04,222 --> 01:58:06,862
game. You, you don't feel... You're not

1767
01:58:06,902 --> 01:58:11,002
intoxicated. I mean, you are, but it makes you clear, you know?

1768
01:58:11,062 --> 01:58:12,662
- So the mind is clear?

1769
01:58:12,702 --> 01:58:16,142
- The mind's totally clear. Your body feels fantastic. You know

1770
01:58:16,182 --> 01:58:20,072
exactly your points. You know exactly how the others...

1771
01:58:20,072 --> 01:58:24,022
'Cause the others are just mortals, you know, because they're sober. They just sit there,

1772
01:58:24,042 --> 01:58:27,942
and they just... They haven't slept very well, or they have problems with them, you know?

1773
01:58:27,982 --> 01:58:30,772
with them, you know? And you're, you're way above them.

1774
01:58:30,782 --> 01:58:34,382
- What do we know about general psychological effects of it? So, does it boost your

1775
01:58:34,422 --> 01:58:37,762
confidence? Does it boost aggressiveness? What effect did it have on

1776
01:58:37,842 --> 01:58:40,142
his vision of the world?

1777
01:58:40,162 --> 01:58:45,801
- It makes you feel extremely confident. You have a lot of energy,

1778
01:58:45,882 --> 01:58:49,712
energy, but it's not too much. Like, let's say you take cocaine or methamphetamine, you're like-

1779
01:58:49,722 --> 01:58:51,552
methamphetamine, you're like-

1780
01:58:51,562 --> 01:58:55,252
That's why Hitler was never a meth guy. That's also why I think this video is fake.

1781
01:58:55,262 --> 01:58:58,622
He was... He didn't take meth. I mean, I studied Morell's,

1782
01:58:59,802 --> 01:59:03,722
the things he gave him. He gave a lot of things, and only

1783
01:59:03,782 --> 01:59:07,422
twice was meth. So that was... That's not a lot for Hitler, like, twice.

1784
01:59:07,462 --> 01:59:11,182
- I read that the multivitamin had some amphetamine and

1785
01:59:11,222 --> 01:59:13,482
maybe meth, a little bit, or no?

1786
01:59:13,492 --> 01:59:13,511
- It's-

1787
01:59:13,522 --> 01:59:14,302
- Multi-

1788
01:59:14,362 --> 01:59:15,042
- I mean, I've s-

1789
01:59:15,052 --> 01:59:15,671
- Vitamultin.

1790
01:59:15,682 --> 01:59:16,731
- Vitamultine.

1791
01:59:16,862 --> 01:59:17,502
- Multine.

1792
01:59:17,522 --> 01:59:21,002
- I mean, Vitamultine is interesting because it was a little bar

1793
01:59:21,082 --> 01:59:24,892
of a sweet that was lying next to his food, so he would just, you know, eat.

1794
01:59:24,902 --> 01:59:28,872
eat, and then at the end, he would take this. It was nice-tasting.

1795
01:59:28,882 --> 01:59:31,842
It had some sugar in it. And I read through all of

1796
01:59:31,902 --> 01:59:35,842
the ingredients. There were different types, and never, there's never methamphetamine in it.

1797
01:59:35,882 --> 01:59:37,852
and never, there's never methamphetamine in it.

1798
01:59:37,882 --> 01:59:39,222
- Oh, there isn't? Okay.

1799
01:59:39,231 --> 01:59:42,842
- No. There was an SS, Dr. Schenck, and he claims

1800
01:59:42,852 --> 01:59:49,882
that Morell made special Vitamultine in his lab with meth in it, but I think he just made that up.

1801
01:59:50,522 --> 01:59:51,422
made that up.

1802
01:59:51,482 --> 01:59:51,842
- Okay.

1803
01:59:51,882 --> 01:59:54,862
- There's... There was never any proof of that.

1804
01:59:54,922 --> 01:59:58,582
- I mean, that's a really important, like, line to draw.

1805
01:59:58,662 --> 02:00:01,482
The, the army, the Nazi army, at

1806
02:00:01,602 --> 02:00:05,522
scale, not everybody, but some fraction, especially during the French campaign, used meth.

1807
02:00:05,542 --> 02:00:07,542
French campaign, used meth.

1808
02:00:07,622 --> 02:00:07,942
- Right.

1809
02:00:07,962 --> 02:00:11,142
- And then there's Hitler, which used a lot of drugs,

1810
02:00:12,242 --> 02:00:14,682
but meth was not one of them, really.

1811
02:00:14,742 --> 02:00:18,162
- No, meth, for him, was just for the foot soldiers, you know?

1812
02:00:18,182 --> 02:00:22,062
I mean, he didn't even talk about meth. This is not nothing that concerned him, you know?

1813
02:00:22,102 --> 02:00:26,062
This is something that makes you function. Maybe... He signed... I mean, it went over his desk,

1814
02:00:26,122 --> 02:00:28,272
it went over his desk, the stimulant decree, but

1815
02:00:29,202 --> 02:00:32,871
I don't know if he really read it or understood it. I mean, he probably knew Pervitin because everyone knew it.

1816
02:00:32,902 --> 02:00:36,662
everyone knew it. And maybe, you know, they discussed it,

1817
02:00:36,702 --> 02:00:40,482
but they would probably also not... I mean, there was... Da- day

1818
02:00:40,602 --> 02:00:44,502
there's a point when there's a conflict about methamphetamine in the army.

1819
02:00:44,542 --> 02:00:49,302
This is when the Secretary of Health of the German government, the Nazi

1820
02:00:49,342 --> 02:00:52,862
government Conti, he starts

1821
02:00:52,922 --> 02:00:56,592
writing to the army, and he says, "You must stop this. This is against

1822
02:00:56,622 --> 02:01:00,482
Nazi ideology." But the army basically doesn't listen

1823
02:01:00,562 --> 02:01:03,922
to him and keeps on using meth all the way to the end. So maybe that

1824
02:01:04,662 --> 02:01:07,902
guy, Conti, maybe he discussed this with Hitler,

1825
02:01:07,982 --> 02:01:11,902
but... Also, Hitler never... You know, if Hitler would have said, "We stop the

1826
02:01:11,942 --> 02:01:15,742
methamphetamine," it probably would have stopped. But Conti saying that wasn't

1827
02:01:15,762 --> 02:01:19,482
enough. I don't think Hitler was really into meth. It was not his thing. He was

1828
02:01:19,522 --> 02:01:26,742
more into the opioids, into these weird hormonal things. Those things were,

1829
02:01:26,782 --> 02:01:30,742
especially the opioids, were interesting to him, because you can function on

1830
02:01:30,842 --> 02:01:33,682
opioids for a long time if you have a proper

1831
02:01:34,542 --> 02:01:40,382
product and a doctor that gives you the injections. Göring was high on, was

1832
02:01:40,442 --> 02:01:48,032
addicted to morphine from 1923 until when the Americans captured him in '45.

1833
02:01:48,182 --> 02:01:51,722
That's 22 years he was functioning on morphine. And when they captured him, he

1834
02:01:51,842 --> 02:01:55,381
had... I write about it in Blitz, like the amount of

1835
02:01:55,502 --> 02:01:59,202
morphine capsules he had on him. So what the Americans did was

1836
02:01:59,862 --> 02:02:03,162
first take away all the morphine from him, and then he went through withdrawal

1837
02:02:03,862 --> 02:02:07,722
in American, you know, incarceration. And he lost, you

1838
02:02:07,762 --> 02:02:10,862
know, a lot of pounds, and he became more of a

1839
02:02:10,882 --> 02:02:14,672
haggard Göring, which was then in Nuremberg, you

1840
02:02:14,722 --> 02:02:17,392
know, this haggard kind of guy defending what he did. And

1841
02:02:18,442 --> 02:02:22,425
so... Hitler was really an opioid guy, while the

1842
02:02:22,505 --> 02:02:26,306
army was really meth-ed up. That's how you could sum it up briefly.

1843
02:02:26,385 --> 02:02:30,226
- He did try cocaine. Why didn't he get into the cocaine?

1844
02:02:30,946 --> 02:02:37,045
- He started cocaine after the bomb attack by Stauffenberg on July 20th, 1944.

1845
02:02:37,885 --> 02:02:41,846
When this bomb went off, which actually killed a few people in the room, this was

1846
02:02:41,866 --> 02:02:45,846
during a military briefing. Stauffenberg put a bag with explosives under

1847
02:02:45,885 --> 02:02:49,626
the table, and the table actually saved Hitler's life because it was a

1848
02:02:49,666 --> 02:02:53,446
good German quality oak table. So the table was so stable that

1849
02:02:53,486 --> 02:02:57,306
the bomb explosion kind of just, it blow up the

1850
02:02:57,366 --> 02:03:00,925
table, but Hitler behind the table was protected by this table.

1851
02:03:00,965 --> 02:03:04,406
- Yeah, this is the closest assassination attempt, probably.

1852
02:03:04,416 --> 02:03:08,326
- Yeah. I mean, it's very weird that it didn't succeed because he had the bomb.

1853
02:03:08,366 --> 02:03:12,316
He put it next to Hitler. He took out some of the explosives before

1854
02:03:12,326 --> 02:03:16,026
he went into the room. This is one of the big mysteries. Why did Stauffenberg

1855
02:03:16,146 --> 02:03:19,626
take out some of the explosives? There's no explanation for

1856
02:03:19,646 --> 02:03:24,616
it. But Hitler survived, but he was quite injured, which Nazi propaganda

1857
02:03:25,986 --> 02:03:29,505
always denied. They always said the Führer was miraculously

1858
02:03:29,526 --> 02:03:33,416
unharmed. But he was quite harmed. There were over a hundred splinters from

1859
02:03:33,505 --> 02:03:38,416
the wood everywhere. His eardrums were blown, which was, you know, it's

1860
02:03:39,385 --> 02:03:42,526
quite an injury, I guess. You know, he was bleeding internally,

1861
02:03:42,566 --> 02:03:46,146
and he was shell-shocked basically. And then a

1862
02:03:46,226 --> 02:03:50,005
new doctor comes in. His name is Keesing. Because

1863
02:03:50,026 --> 02:03:54,005
Morell was not a... In Germany we have, well, I

1864
02:03:54,026 --> 02:03:58,505
guess worldwide, it's the ear, nose and throat specialist, right?

1865
02:03:58,566 --> 02:04:02,505
So an ear, nose and throat specialist from the German army called

1866
02:04:02,545 --> 02:04:06,385
Dr. Keesing, he was ordered to come into headquarters after the bomb

1867
02:04:06,396 --> 02:04:13,346
attack to treat Hitler's blown eardrums. And Keesing

1868
02:04:14,026 --> 02:04:16,696
gave Hitler cocaine, because cocaine

1869
02:04:17,746 --> 02:04:21,706
at the time was being... You know, it was used. It

1870
02:04:21,766 --> 02:04:25,726
was not Schedule 1, you know. It was... It had the effect that

1871
02:04:25,766 --> 02:04:28,566
it would numb the pain, and you could use

1872
02:04:28,626 --> 02:04:32,545
it, you would put it on a certain place where you

1873
02:04:32,586 --> 02:04:35,666
had the pain and then it would numb that area.

1874
02:04:35,686 --> 02:04:39,675
But Hitler had never taken cocaine before,

1875
02:04:39,786 --> 02:04:43,686
but he got very interested in it. And Keesing writes a meticulous report about

1876
02:04:43,706 --> 02:04:47,166
his experiences with Hitler. Alone, that report is really fun to

1877
02:04:47,206 --> 02:04:51,005
read. It's about a 15-page report that he did for

1878
02:04:51,066 --> 02:04:54,826
American military after the war. When he was being interrogated by

1879
02:04:54,885 --> 02:04:58,806
American military, he described what happened with Hitler and him.

1880
02:04:58,826 --> 02:05:02,746
And he realized that Hitler really liked the cocaine, and then he started

1881
02:05:02,806 --> 02:05:06,306
saying, "Now give it in the nose now," and then

1882
02:05:06,866 --> 02:05:12,465
it was a liquid that he could apply with a dab into the nose.

1883
02:05:12,486 --> 02:05:14,806
It wasn't cocaine powder, but he could-

1884
02:05:14,885 --> 02:05:16,545
- It was liquified. Yeah, interesting.

1885
02:05:16,566 --> 02:05:21,066
- Liquefied cocaine. And Hitler loved it, and he's just saying things like, "Finally,

1886
02:05:21,965 --> 02:05:25,746
I can think clear again." He had this cocaine rush, which is a rush

1887
02:05:25,866 --> 02:05:29,726
of superiority. It's a dangerous drug because you

1888
02:05:29,806 --> 02:05:33,326
think you know more than the other. It's not a very humble

1889
02:05:33,385 --> 02:05:40,146
drug, you know. It just increases the ego. And that actually

1890
02:05:40,766 --> 02:05:42,246
he liked that because that was

1891
02:05:43,446 --> 02:05:47,266
after the bomb attack, he thought everyone was a traitor. He didn't feel safe

1892
02:05:47,286 --> 02:05:51,276
anymore in his own bunker, you know. And he was like, "Nazis..." The

1893
02:05:51,286 --> 02:05:54,894
right wing is always paranoid. "Who's the enemy? They're behind us. They're

1894
02:05:54,894 --> 02:05:58,856
stabbing us in the back." Hitler was this type of person.

1895
02:05:58,866 --> 02:06:02,446
So the cocaine kind of stabilized him, and Keesing

1896
02:06:02,505 --> 02:06:06,416
realized that this guy is a drug guy. He didn't know. He came in, he saw the

1897
02:06:06,446 --> 02:06:10,246
Führer for the first time. He was in awe. And a drug wreck was

1898
02:06:10,286 --> 02:06:14,056
approaching him. And as soon as he had some cocaine in his system—this was the summer of

1899
02:06:14,056 --> 02:06:18,005
'44—he had already taken a lot of opioids and a lot of drugs. So

1900
02:06:18,066 --> 02:06:22,005
he, and a lot of these dubious hormonal concoctions which led to

1901
02:06:22,106 --> 02:06:26,045
autoimmune diseases in Hitler, maybe he even had Parkinson's. He was

1902
02:06:26,666 --> 02:06:30,566
Morell basically turned him into a physical wreck. Keesing also

1903
02:06:30,586 --> 02:06:34,576
writes about this, like he's trembling before he goes into the room for the first time where

1904
02:06:34,586 --> 02:06:35,806
the Führer is. And then there's like

1905
02:06:36,606 --> 02:06:40,585
an old guy in a blue kind of pajama, kind of coming up to

1906
02:06:40,626 --> 02:06:44,556
him and shaking his hand. "That's the Führer," you know.

1907
02:06:44,606 --> 02:06:48,316
And Keesing is totally shocked because, you know, the

1908
02:06:48,726 --> 02:06:53,376
destiny of the German nation, the whole of Europe, everything is like-

1909
02:06:53,385 --> 02:06:57,246
hangs on this guy, you know. And then whenever he takes cocaine, he's a

1910
02:06:57,286 --> 02:07:00,546
little bit better. But the cocaine had the problem that

1911
02:07:02,246 --> 02:07:05,465
Keesing was more of a, at least later in

1912
02:07:05,546 --> 02:07:09,246
his discussions with the U.S. military, he described

1913
02:07:09,266 --> 02:07:12,706
himself as a conscientious guy. He's like,

1914
02:07:13,706 --> 02:07:17,986
"I became... I had problems giving Hitler more cocaine." And-

1915
02:07:18,026 --> 02:07:20,486
- Yeah, and I'm sure Hitler could have sensed that.

1916
02:07:20,496 --> 02:07:24,446
- And then Morell started disliking Keeseing because

1917
02:07:24,465 --> 02:07:28,166
Hitler spent more time with Keeseing than with him. And there was this-

1918
02:07:28,546 --> 02:07:32,166
this, what I call the doctor's war ensued. 'Cause

1919
02:07:32,266 --> 02:07:35,846
Keeseing then tried to get rid of Morell because Keeseing could suddenly

1920
02:07:35,965 --> 02:07:40,425
see that Hitler was receiving a lot of drugs.

1921
02:07:41,326 --> 02:07:45,166
He was taking cocaine with Keeseing. Keeseing left the room. Then

1922
02:07:45,226 --> 02:07:48,726
Morell would come in and give him Eukodal opioid

1923
02:07:48,786 --> 02:07:52,585
intravenously, which is the speedball effect.

1924
02:07:52,646 --> 02:07:56,585
Cocaine and an opioid, you know, at the same time. That's

1925
02:07:56,646 --> 02:08:00,385
like, that creates a really crazy high. But that's a high that's not

1926
02:08:00,446 --> 02:08:04,406
stable anymore, you know. That's a high that you... That's like at

1927
02:08:04,465 --> 02:08:07,986
the end of your drug career. You take the speedball.

1928
02:08:08,066 --> 02:08:10,106
- So a speedball is a combination of a stimulant-

1929
02:08:10,146 --> 02:08:10,346
- Right

1930
02:08:10,425 --> 02:08:13,255
- ... and a depressant. Cocaine and heroin.

1931
02:08:13,255 --> 02:08:14,226
- Opioids are depressants.

1932
02:08:15,206 --> 02:08:20,577
- Yeah. So combining cocaine and heroin, huh? Wow... Oh.

1933
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:24,577
- I've never had a speedball, but I think it's the most hardcore drug experience you

1934
02:08:24,617 --> 02:08:28,518
can have, you know. And Hitler had this in the summer of 1944 for

1935
02:08:28,558 --> 02:08:32,358
quite some time. And then the doctors really fought

1936
02:08:32,478 --> 02:08:36,197
for influence over Hitler. And Keeseing teamed up with

1937
02:08:36,238 --> 02:08:40,117
Himmler, head of the SS, and basically said to Himmler,

1938
02:08:40,518 --> 02:08:44,098
"This Morell guy..." And Himmler was really suspicious of Morell

1939
02:08:44,157 --> 02:08:48,108
obviously, because Morell was spending so much time with Hitler. There's no control.

1940
02:08:48,117 --> 02:08:51,988
Himmler was a control freak. "What is he actually giving to the Führer? The Führer doesn't

1941
02:08:52,018 --> 02:08:57,548
look good anymore." So Keeseing was trying to get Morell out. Maybe because

1942
02:08:57,558 --> 02:09:00,858
he wanted Hitler to have better health. Maybe he wanted to have the job

1943
02:09:00,898 --> 02:09:07,478
himself. He certainly tried to get rid of Morell, and it came to like, a high noon

1944
02:09:07,518 --> 02:09:11,077
situation, like the duel between the two doctors.

1945
02:09:11,998 --> 02:09:15,938
It's, by the way, why I think it's completely insane that Hollywood

1946
02:09:15,978 --> 02:09:19,758
hasn't bought the rights yet. Alone, this doctor's war.

1947
02:09:19,798 --> 02:09:21,478
- You mean for the entire Blitz story or?

1948
02:09:21,518 --> 02:09:22,438
- Yeah, of course.

1949
02:09:22,478 --> 02:09:26,208
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's really... I mean, some of the greatest movies... I mean, like,

1950
02:09:26,278 --> 02:09:28,447
Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

1951
02:09:28,478 --> 02:09:31,338
- You can do a drug movie on the Nazis.

1952
02:09:31,438 --> 02:09:35,077
- You know, one of my favorite movies, probably Downfall, which is Hitler in the

1953
02:09:35,138 --> 02:09:38,397
bunker, which does, I guess... Does Downfall have a drug-

1954
02:09:38,478 --> 02:09:38,758
- No.

1955
02:09:38,768 --> 02:09:39,068
- ... component to that?

1956
02:09:39,068 --> 02:09:42,958
- They missed the drug angle. Because my book hadn't been out yet, they didn't know about it.

1957
02:09:43,018 --> 02:09:45,308
That's why they can't-

1958
02:09:45,308 --> 02:09:46,478
- That'd be a different story.

1959
02:09:46,518 --> 02:09:50,138
- They can't really explain why Hitler became a physical

1960
02:09:50,218 --> 02:09:53,228
wreck. There's no explanation for it except the drugs.

1961
02:09:53,278 --> 02:09:53,358
- Well-

1962
02:09:53,367 --> 02:09:54,388
- The opioid addiction.

1963
02:09:54,478 --> 02:09:57,748
- You could explain it. It is a part of it that

1964
02:09:58,138 --> 02:10:01,858
you're... It's just an extremely stressful position he's in.

1965
02:10:01,898 --> 02:10:03,697
- Yeah, but you don't become a physical wreck if you're...

1966
02:10:03,708 --> 02:10:06,108
- And he's losing the war. The physical wreck aspect, yeah.

1967
02:10:06,117 --> 02:10:10,098
- And there were two bedrooms in the bunker in Berlin. Two bedrooms.

1968
02:10:10,117 --> 02:10:13,978
One, of course, for Hitler, the other one for Morell.

1969
02:10:13,998 --> 02:10:17,878
No one else was sleeping in the bunker. I mean, you can see

1970
02:10:18,018 --> 02:10:21,648
the importance of, especially in those last months, of

1971
02:10:21,697 --> 02:10:25,598
Morell in the bunker. And they didn't get that when they

1972
02:10:25,638 --> 02:10:29,577
made the movie, The Downfall. But it's still an interesting

1973
02:10:29,617 --> 02:10:33,367
movie, but I can't take it seriously because they didn't see this as a...

1974
02:10:33,367 --> 02:10:34,298
- As a drug component.

1975
02:10:34,318 --> 02:10:34,487
- It's missing.

1976
02:10:34,498 --> 02:10:36,238
- Again, I don't think it has to be

1977
02:10:37,858 --> 02:10:41,838
the main thing, but it has to be a part of it. A serious movie

1978
02:10:41,918 --> 02:10:45,778
on Blitzed would be really nice. It's not easy to do.

1979
02:10:45,858 --> 02:10:46,318
- No.

1980
02:10:46,358 --> 02:10:49,077
- There's something about drugs, if you do a movie on drugs,

1981
02:10:50,538 --> 02:10:54,398
that involve drugs, that it makes it... You can

1982
02:10:54,438 --> 02:10:56,697
go too far into like Tarantino territory...

1983
02:10:56,778 --> 02:10:56,898
- Right

1984
02:10:57,298 --> 02:11:01,028
- ...where it's more like... which is also incredible and awesome, but it's a

1985
02:11:01,218 --> 02:11:02,108
different thing.

1986
02:11:02,138 --> 02:11:05,238
- Well, he invents history, and he's very open about it.

1987
02:11:05,258 --> 02:11:05,358
- Yeah.

1988
02:11:05,378 --> 02:11:09,238
- Like, this is not what actually happened. I think a Blitzed movie

1989
02:11:09,298 --> 02:11:13,938
would have to stick to the facts. And I've spoken with some directors,

1990
02:11:13,978 --> 02:11:17,088
very good German directors, and it's just very hard to do. But...

1991
02:11:17,098 --> 02:11:19,858
- But if you do it well, that's a legendary movie.

1992
02:11:19,918 --> 02:11:20,088
- I think it would be. Yeah. Yeah.

1993
02:11:20,117 --> 02:11:23,978
- Yeah, that would be incredible. Can you just speak high

1994
02:11:24,077 --> 02:11:29,258
level from, from... What is it? You said '41 to '45. What were some

1995
02:11:30,458 --> 02:11:37,638
behavioral changes or changes in decision making that we can trace

1996
02:11:38,318 --> 02:11:43,838
in Hitler that could be attributed to drugs? Like, how did they change him?

1997
02:11:43,938 --> 02:11:50,878
- Well, an interesting event is July 1943 in a villa in Northern

1998
02:11:50,938 --> 02:11:54,858
Italy where Hitler meets Mussolini. And Mussolini

1999
02:11:54,898 --> 02:12:01,278
is basically fed up with the war, and he wants Italy to leave the Axis of

2000
02:12:01,398 --> 02:12:05,318
Evil. And Hitler is really pissed when he hears

2001
02:12:05,378 --> 02:12:09,088
that. He knows that's what the meeting is all about. And Mussolini,

2002
02:12:09,138 --> 02:12:12,258
I mean, the Italians invented that modern type of

2003
02:12:12,298 --> 02:12:15,697
fascism. And they were all... Italy was the role model for

2004
02:12:16,398 --> 02:12:20,248
Nazi Germany, but by now, Nazi Germany, of course, has been

2005
02:12:20,298 --> 02:12:24,248
much more powerful. But, you know, Italy is the most important ally.

2006
02:12:24,318 --> 02:12:28,428
And now Mussolini is like quitting in the middle of the war. I mean,

2007
02:12:29,358 --> 02:12:33,038
what is going on here? So Hitler becomes... And Morell writes about

2008
02:12:33,098 --> 02:12:36,468
this quite a lot. He's in a terrible mood. He really... he doesn't

2009
02:12:36,498 --> 02:12:40,358
want to go. Like, he might lose his, you know, temper or

2010
02:12:40,398 --> 02:12:44,098
whatever. He's not happy. And that's actually, that's the day

2011
02:12:44,138 --> 02:12:47,998
when he receives the Eukodal for the first time. And he... Because he says

2012
02:12:48,258 --> 02:12:51,878
under such stress, I'm not gonna go." He threatens, like he

2013
02:12:51,938 --> 02:12:55,178
calls off the whole thing. The plane's already waiting in Obersalzberg.

2014
02:12:55,218 --> 02:12:59,008
Everything is ready, and he says, "I'm not meeting this guy."

2015
02:12:59,918 --> 02:13:03,498
And then Morell gives him Eukodal, and you can see, you know, the

2016
02:13:03,657 --> 02:13:07,438
time when he gets the Eukodal. And that's when he has this effect for the

2017
02:13:07,478 --> 02:13:11,198
first time, this like, "I can do anything. This is great. I'm

2018
02:13:11,218 --> 02:13:14,718
gonna, I'm gonna explain to Mussolini that he's not gonna leave the war

2019
02:13:14,778 --> 02:13:18,708
effort." And on the way to the plane, he says to Morell

2020
02:13:18,998 --> 02:13:22,918
that this Eukodal is really helping him, and he

2021
02:13:22,998 --> 02:13:26,918
wants another shot, and he receives another shot. So he has

2022
02:13:26,998 --> 02:13:30,487
quite a lot of Eukodal in him when he speaks to Mussolini. And there's

2023
02:13:30,558 --> 02:13:34,438
like the people who write the protocol

2024
02:13:34,478 --> 02:13:38,428
of the meeting, and also other people around. It's not just two people in the room.

2025
02:13:38,478 --> 02:13:42,458
It's like, I don't know, 15 or 20 people in the room. And a lot

2026
02:13:42,498 --> 02:13:46,367
of people talk about that meeting in their memoirs. And

2027
02:13:46,478 --> 02:13:50,258
Mussolini is not able to say one word basically, because Hitler is so

2028
02:13:50,398 --> 02:13:54,098
high and so charged, and he's just telling the whole time how

2029
02:13:54,157 --> 02:13:58,098
great this is, you know, what they're doing right now. And of course, it's not

2030
02:13:58,138 --> 02:14:02,018
even possible that you're gonna leave, you know. We are in

2031
02:14:02,058 --> 02:14:05,838
this together from... you know, he explains everything, the whole thing, for like two

2032
02:14:05,938 --> 02:14:12,178
hours, and Mussolini is just like, is like... Then a messenger comes in and says,

2033
02:14:12,198 --> 02:14:15,838
"Rome has just been bombed." He's like, and he's

2034
02:14:16,698 --> 02:14:20,538
like he knows, but he can't say anything and he stays, you know. So

2035
02:14:20,577 --> 02:14:23,827
that was very much influenced, that meeting, by his

2036
02:14:23,838 --> 02:14:27,568
Eukodal. And that's probably because it was so successful in Hitler's eyes, what

2037
02:14:27,657 --> 02:14:31,498
happened, is why Eukodal became a very attractive drug for

2038
02:14:31,538 --> 02:14:35,498
him. And this happened, this was the first time in July 1943. And then, so it

2039
02:14:35,518 --> 02:14:39,298
didn't take Eukodal through the whole time. You know, it only started in July

2040
02:14:39,358 --> 02:14:43,178
1943, he started with regular opioid use. You can

2041
02:14:43,278 --> 02:14:47,268
see that he takes it more and more regularly now. Not every day, but

2042
02:14:47,518 --> 02:14:51,138
sometimes, like there's a September 1944, he takes

2043
02:14:51,538 --> 02:14:55,298
Eukodal every second day, which is like a junkie rhythm. You take it, and the

2044
02:14:55,358 --> 02:14:58,438
next day, you don't take it. Then you take it again.

2045
02:14:58,458 --> 02:14:59,898
- Why is that junkie rhythm?

2046
02:14:59,938 --> 02:15:02,098
- You don't take it all the time because you need to,

2047
02:15:03,138 --> 02:15:06,698
I don't know, relax or, you don't, there's

2048
02:15:06,778 --> 02:15:10,658
like, you take it maybe Saturday night, you take

2049
02:15:10,718 --> 02:15:14,647
it, and the high lasts till Sunday morning. And then Sunday when

2050
02:15:14,678 --> 02:15:18,038
the high slowly wears off, you sleep, and then you wake up, and you're

2051
02:15:18,078 --> 02:15:22,018
hungry. Maybe you eat. And then the next day, Monday, you're gonna do it again.

2052
02:15:22,058 --> 02:15:24,078
So that's, that's this rhythm.

2053
02:15:24,118 --> 02:15:27,888
- And it was more potent than what is it, Dolantin?

2054
02:15:27,898 --> 02:15:28,418
- Dolantine.

2055
02:15:28,438 --> 02:15:28,658
- Do- Dolan-

2056
02:15:28,678 --> 02:15:32,398
- Eukodal is said to have the best effect, the best in the...

2057
02:15:32,738 --> 02:15:36,638
In the sense of it's not about strength, you know, you just increase the dosage and you have a

2058
02:15:36,718 --> 02:15:40,148
stronger effect, but you can't increase it too much because then you're gonna die, you know.

2059
02:15:40,178 --> 02:15:44,108
That's also the problem with opioids. If you take too much, you're going to die,

2060
02:15:44,138 --> 02:15:46,498
'cause you're just gonna have a heart attack. So but...

2061
02:15:46,518 --> 02:15:48,288
- There's nuance differences that...

2062
02:15:48,288 --> 02:15:50,258
...it's hard to convert into words, I guess. Yeah.

2063
02:15:50,298 --> 02:15:54,098
- Different molecules have different effects. So Eukodal apparently had the best

2064
02:15:54,158 --> 02:15:55,968
effect. That's why they had the oxycodone

2065
02:15:56,918 --> 02:16:00,908
epidemic in America, because people take this pill, I mean,

2066
02:16:00,958 --> 02:16:04,818
thank God they're not injecting it all like Hitler did. They take a pill,

2067
02:16:04,858 --> 02:16:08,518
so it's not as dangerous as injecting. But apparently the effect is so

2068
02:16:08,538 --> 02:16:16,458
pleasant of this Eukodal, of this particular type of opioid, that it just

2069
02:16:16,538 --> 02:16:19,538
is more attractive maybe than Dolantin.

2070
02:16:19,578 --> 02:16:23,278
- Is it possible to try to reverse engineer

2071
02:16:24,238 --> 02:16:27,818
the effect of Hitler's drug use on the outcome of World War II?

2072
02:16:27,838 --> 02:16:33,576
So if he didn't use any drugs, would the Nazis been more successful

2073
02:16:33,598 --> 02:16:38,858
or less successful? What do you think?

2074
02:16:38,938 --> 02:16:42,817
- I think it would be speculative to answer, but I can try. Uh,

2075
02:16:42,897 --> 02:16:47,298
but it's very the war is so complex. I mean,

2076
02:16:48,998 --> 02:16:52,758
there's many different ways this war could have played out and ended,

2077
02:16:52,878 --> 02:16:55,656
but I think it would always have ended with a German defeat.

2078
02:16:55,758 --> 02:16:58,237
- I don't think it would have ended with a German defeat.

2079
02:16:58,278 --> 02:17:01,987
- Well, if you don't attack the Soviet Union, then of course you can win.

2080
02:17:02,038 --> 02:17:02,858
But as soon as you attack the Soviet Union...

2081
02:17:02,918 --> 02:17:06,638
- As we talked about, I think the probability of success is low.

2082
02:17:07,576 --> 02:17:12,118
But, you know, I would put it like, I don't know, 10%. Again...

2083
02:17:12,156 --> 02:17:12,246
- Right

2084
02:17:12,246 --> 02:17:16,156
- ...extremely speculative. But if you do Blitzkrieg type of

2085
02:17:16,237 --> 02:17:20,138
attack, very rapid, don't split the forces in Operation

2086
02:17:20,178 --> 02:17:27,538
Barbarossa, go straight for Moscow. Don't invade Britain. Don't declare war on

2087
02:17:27,618 --> 02:17:34,338
the United States, and really focus on gaining oil from the Middle

2088
02:17:34,418 --> 02:17:42,358
East. So maybe making the Africa campaign the central point in the

2089
02:17:42,397 --> 02:17:46,198
very beginning so that you have the resources that are essential for the industrial

2090
02:17:46,778 --> 02:17:50,678
capacity of Germany that's required to, you know, keep manufacturing and

2091
02:17:50,758 --> 02:17:54,718
keep fueling the planes, the tanks, the mechanized aspect of the army.

2092
02:17:54,778 --> 02:17:58,237
So there's a lot of paths to this. I mean, but I don't think,

2093
02:17:58,298 --> 02:18:05,897
I think it's probably fair to say that reasonable, thoughtful,

2094
02:18:05,958 --> 02:18:09,227
calculated, disciplined

2095
02:18:10,737 --> 02:18:15,608
leader would not have done any of the things Hitler did, even in the beginning.

2096
02:18:15,618 --> 02:18:19,198
I mean, it requires insanity, it requires hatred, it

2097
02:18:19,237 --> 02:18:24,698
requires ideological self-capture where you tell yourself narratives that

2098
02:18:25,538 --> 02:18:29,076
rapidly deviate from like ground truth, from first principles of

2099
02:18:29,118 --> 02:18:32,928
things. And you're just an insane person. You're an insane dictator

2100
02:18:33,038 --> 02:18:36,718
that's drunk on power. And it's impossible for you to make great

2101
02:18:36,778 --> 02:18:38,977
military decisions at that point.

2102
02:18:39,058 --> 02:18:42,958
- Yeah, you would need like an impossible Hitler that is as crazy as he was,

2103
02:18:43,098 --> 02:18:44,518
but still wouldn't make any...

2104
02:18:44,538 --> 02:18:44,736
- Mistakes

2105
02:18:44,758 --> 02:18:48,298
- ...irrational mistakes. So that doesn't exist. Hitler can only be

2106
02:18:48,418 --> 02:18:56,118
imagined or understood as this, this, this, in a way, as the drugs. Hitler

2107
02:18:56,138 --> 02:18:59,878
without drugs is unthinkable for me. And it, it doesn't, it

2108
02:18:59,958 --> 02:19:06,998
makes, he was the drug guy. You cannot, you cannot separate this. So Hitler was a

2109
02:19:07,076 --> 02:19:10,958
self-destructive personality, and National Socialism is a

2110
02:19:10,998 --> 02:19:14,858
self-destructive movement. That's why I said I think the Germans would have lost

2111
02:19:14,918 --> 02:19:18,718
in any case. You know, except if there was this, this

2112
02:19:18,897 --> 02:19:22,618
perfect Hitler, which is theoretically impossible.

2113
02:19:22,977 --> 02:19:26,798
- Theoretically possible in the 20th century. I mean, you could think of a

2114
02:19:26,838 --> 02:19:30,718
Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great type characters that would

2115
02:19:30,778 --> 02:19:34,438
really internalize the sense of, in the case of Hitler, that the German

2116
02:19:34,558 --> 02:19:39,468
people are, like without the hatred, without the ideology, but with the

2117
02:19:39,618 --> 02:19:43,397
murderous with the ability to

2118
02:19:43,518 --> 02:19:48,878
dehumanize the rest of the world and see the German people as, uh-

2119
02:19:48,938 --> 02:19:49,398
- Superior

2120
02:19:49,488 --> 02:19:53,398
- ...the superior, and so it's fair to do the Lebensraum

2121
02:19:53,418 --> 02:19:54,658
and all of that kind of stuff.

2122
02:19:54,738 --> 02:19:55,058
- Right.

2123
02:19:55,098 --> 02:19:58,778
- It's hard to, it's just,

2124
02:19:58,878 --> 02:20:02,618
the reason you want to think about that kind of stuff is Hitler got, to me at

2125
02:20:02,678 --> 02:20:08,018
least, close to capturing a very large part of the world. And it's inc-

2126
02:20:08,058 --> 02:20:14,398
it's, it's terrifying and sort of unbelievable

2127
02:20:14,458 --> 02:20:16,458
that somebody could get close to that.

2128
02:20:17,578 --> 02:20:21,278
- I mean, what you described as this feeling of superiority and conquering

2129
02:20:21,378 --> 02:20:25,128
countries, that was basically what the Wehrmacht, the high command, that's what they were going

2130
02:20:25,278 --> 02:20:29,278
for. And they wanted to eliminate Hitler in the Operation

2131
02:20:29,358 --> 02:20:33,346
Valkyrie, not because they thought, "He's an evil guy,

2132
02:20:33,406 --> 02:20:37,286
he's killing the Jews," or, you know, they wanted to eliminate him because he was not

2133
02:20:37,306 --> 02:20:41,026
this effective decision-maker anymore that they needed to win the

2134
02:20:41,106 --> 02:20:49,906
war, or to end it in a different way. And I spoke with Anthony Beevor once about

2135
02:20:50,606 --> 02:20:55,486
the attempt of British intelligence to assassinate Hitler,

2136
02:20:56,646 --> 02:21:00,166
and he had seen some evidence that at the point in

2137
02:21:00,226 --> 02:21:05,526
time, they dropped those plans because they knew that

2138
02:21:06,406 --> 02:21:09,306
drugged Hitler or malfunctioning Hitler, which he

2139
02:21:09,366 --> 02:21:13,086
was after, you know, the summer of 1943,

2140
02:21:14,086 --> 02:21:17,966
is better for Britain than, you know, killing Hitler and then

2141
02:21:18,026 --> 02:21:21,626
having to deal with, like, some kind of, you know, maybe the army would have taken over the

2142
02:21:21,666 --> 02:21:26,706
country, and that would have been more uncomfortable for Great Britain than having

2143
02:21:26,766 --> 02:21:31,606
the continuation of the degenerating maniac.

2144
02:21:31,646 --> 02:21:37,986
- What do we know about the very end, Hitler in the bunker? The

2145
02:21:38,046 --> 02:21:41,546
moments, the days, the weeks, the months leading up to

2146
02:21:42,406 --> 02:21:45,726
the suicide, all those kinds of things?

2147
02:21:45,766 --> 02:21:49,646
- It's quite well-documented because people at the time were

2148
02:21:49,706 --> 02:21:53,416
keeping diaries and writing about it, writing about their experiences.

2149
02:21:53,446 --> 02:21:57,186
Also, Morell wrote quite a bit what happened in the bunker. Um,

2150
02:21:58,186 --> 02:22:05,346
one thing that changed was that Eukodal was not available anymore, so the drug that

2151
02:22:05,366 --> 02:22:09,046
Hitler actually had become physically addicted to was suddenly

2152
02:22:09,146 --> 02:22:12,306
not available anymore. This had to do with the

2153
02:22:12,346 --> 02:22:20,286
bombardment of the Merck company, the factory in December 1944. British

2154
02:22:20,346 --> 02:22:25,286
bombers destroyed the production facilities.

2155
02:22:26,206 --> 02:22:30,246
And Morell, there's a report of Morell, the

2156
02:22:31,506 --> 02:22:37,926
overweight person riding on a motorcycle through bombed out Berlin from pharmacy to

2157
02:22:37,966 --> 02:22:41,916
pharmacy, basically going into the pharmacies trying to score Eukodal, and

2158
02:22:41,926 --> 02:22:45,636
he couldn't find it anymore. It was nowhere to be found, and that's when

2159
02:22:45,646 --> 02:22:49,386
Hitler goes into withdrawal. What I find surprising is that he

2160
02:22:49,426 --> 02:22:53,346
didn't use another opioid because morphine was available all the way till the

2161
02:22:53,446 --> 02:22:57,026
end, but he never kind of made that switch then. Like, he

2162
02:22:57,066 --> 02:23:00,856
doesn't... Also, he didn't realize for a long time that he becomes

2163
02:23:00,946 --> 02:23:04,166
physically dependent on a drug, that he becomes a drug

2164
02:23:04,266 --> 02:23:08,226
addict, but this realization happens in the last

2165
02:23:08,286 --> 02:23:12,166
weeks in the bunker because Goebbels, he understood it,

2166
02:23:12,206 --> 02:23:17,626
and Goebbels wanted that bedroom, the second bedroom. So he said to Hitler,

2167
02:23:19,066 --> 02:23:22,866
"Do you understand what's going on, that Morell turns you

2168
02:23:22,906 --> 02:23:26,846
into a drug addict?" And Hitler's like, and at

2169
02:23:26,866 --> 02:23:30,676
one point he realized what Goebbels is saying is true because he felt the

2170
02:23:30,706 --> 02:23:33,326
withdrawal, he was shaking and he felt like shit,

2171
02:23:33,386 --> 02:23:36,326
and- and Morell is, like, giving him

2172
02:23:37,146 --> 02:23:40,366
weird stuff in the end. Like, one time he gives him

2173
02:23:40,546 --> 02:23:44,386
harmine, which is an MAO inhibitor, which

2174
02:23:44,446 --> 02:23:48,346
is part of ayahuasca actually because he still had that in

2175
02:23:48,386 --> 02:23:52,246
his doctor's bag. It hadn't been used yet, so he gives him that, which also creates some

2176
02:23:52,266 --> 02:23:56,056
kind of a weird high, but, you know,

2177
02:23:56,086 --> 02:24:00,006
Hitler at one point realizes really what's going on. This is late

2178
02:24:00,086 --> 02:24:03,886
April, so very late in the game, and there's a few

2179
02:24:03,926 --> 02:24:07,806
reports of what actually happens, like some say that Morell has

2180
02:24:07,846 --> 02:24:11,076
to kneel in front of him and that Hitler puts a gun on his head and

2181
02:24:11,106 --> 02:24:15,076
says, "You've been making me addicted to opioids. Get the hell out

2182
02:24:15,086 --> 02:24:18,986
of the bunker." For sure he fires him that day, and

2183
02:24:19,026 --> 02:24:21,586
then Morell's described as being in tears,

2184
02:24:21,626 --> 02:24:25,586
like, leaving the bunker, he gets one of the last planes

2185
02:24:25,666 --> 02:24:29,386
out of Berlin. He has a research lab in the south of Bavaria close to the

2186
02:24:29,446 --> 02:24:34,176
Berghof, and he makes one of the last or the last plane out of Berlin.

2187
02:24:34,186 --> 02:24:35,186
- He survives?

2188
02:24:35,246 --> 02:24:39,196
- Yeah. And he goes to this research lab, and this is like May 2nd,

2189
02:24:39,226 --> 02:24:42,386
1945. He has like a little apartment in this research

2190
02:24:42,506 --> 02:24:47,226
lab. His wife is still in Berlin. He's all alone, and he starts doing his taxes,

2191
02:24:48,966 --> 02:24:52,286
and that kind of shows you that he was probably insane at that point, you know?

2192
02:24:52,406 --> 02:24:53,426
- Just totally out of touch.

2193
02:24:53,466 --> 02:24:57,326
- Why would you do your tax... Maybe he was bored, you know, maybe he didn't do his taxes

2194
02:24:57,366 --> 02:25:01,126
for so long because he always had to treat Hitler and then he thinks like, "Now what am I gonna

2195
02:25:01,166 --> 02:25:05,706
do? I'm just gonna do my taxes now." Very German thing to do.

2196
02:25:05,946 --> 02:25:09,156
- He's just a strange character. I mean, you tell this whole story...

2197
02:25:09,166 --> 02:25:12,326
- I would put that in the movie for sure, him doing his taxes and...

2198
02:25:12,346 --> 02:25:14,086
- That's how the movie ends.

2199
02:25:14,146 --> 02:25:18,126
- Well, then the Americans move into Bavaria, liberate Bavaria from national

2200
02:25:18,246 --> 02:25:22,146
socialism, which was a great job they did there, and

2201
02:25:23,366 --> 02:25:26,366
so I'm also thankful not only to the Red Army but also to the American

2202
02:25:26,486 --> 02:25:30,126
forces. Really very thankful that

2203
02:25:30,166 --> 02:25:33,136
they... Because national socialism was hard to beat. It was a beast, you

2204
02:25:33,186 --> 02:25:38,286
know? It was hard to beat. So they capture Morell.

2205
02:25:39,386 --> 02:25:43,145
and they interrogate him, and he actually lives for another two years in American custody in

2206
02:25:43,196 --> 02:25:46,446
Germany, in a military prison. And after these two

2207
02:25:46,486 --> 02:25:50,336
years, his health's really bad. He has heart problems and,

2208
02:25:50,386 --> 02:25:54,226
the Americans dump him in front of the Munich

2209
02:25:54,286 --> 02:25:58,086
train station in a much too small kind of uniform

2210
02:25:58,146 --> 02:26:02,066
jacket, like probably an American uniform, and he's lying on the

2211
02:26:02,106 --> 02:26:06,046
pavement in front of the train station. And a half-Jewish nurse that

2212
02:26:06,166 --> 02:26:10,086
walks around there, finds him, and she says, "I'm Theo Morell." It's like,

2213
02:26:10,126 --> 02:26:13,966
it's really like in a movie. "I'm Theo Morell. I was the personal physician of the

2214
02:26:14,086 --> 02:26:18,246
Führer." She's like, "This is 1947. Germany's in ruins."

2215
02:26:18,366 --> 02:26:22,266
And she brings him to a hospital. His wife comes from Berlin for the last

2216
02:26:22,306 --> 02:26:26,006
time. They meet in a hospital at Tegernsee, beautiful lake in

2217
02:26:26,046 --> 02:26:29,836
Bavaria, and then he dies. So that was the end of Morell.

2218
02:26:30,826 --> 02:26:33,346
So we know pretty much what happens in the end.

2219
02:26:33,602 --> 02:26:37,502
- ...did somebody try to talk to Hitler about this? Like, what about Eva Braun?

2220
02:26:37,522 --> 02:26:40,082
Has anybody close to him tried to talk about-

2221
02:26:40,102 --> 02:26:41,542
- Well, Goebbels did.

2222
02:26:41,582 --> 02:26:45,472
- Well, that at the very end. But you would imagine maybe the

2223
02:26:45,472 --> 02:26:49,342
the generals, or friends, or inner circle. I mean, that, the reason I mentioned Eva is

2224
02:26:49,362 --> 02:26:54,162
because, you know, like, personal, and people close to him.

2225
02:26:54,172 --> 02:26:57,942
- There is a certain tension between Eva Braun and Morell. And I could very well

2226
02:26:58,002 --> 02:27:01,212
imagine that she talked with Hitler about it, but there's no record, so I don't know

2227
02:27:01,262 --> 02:27:04,702
exactly. But they had a very intimate

2228
02:27:04,742 --> 02:27:08,732
relationship. So Eva Braun was not just the dumb blonde that

2229
02:27:08,742 --> 02:27:12,712
plays no role. They actually spoke every day. And when Hitler was in

2230
02:27:12,742 --> 02:27:16,732
the military headquarters, he would phone her every night at 10:00 PM. They would have

2231
02:27:16,962 --> 02:27:20,402
a long phone conversation. So they had a very deep

2232
02:27:20,442 --> 02:27:24,102
relationship, and I'm pretty sure she didn't really like

2233
02:27:24,142 --> 02:27:27,842
Morell because, you know, for the obvious reasons. He was closer to

2234
02:27:27,882 --> 02:27:30,422
Hitler than herself. And, you know, if

2235
02:27:30,482 --> 02:27:34,752
you count one plus one, it's two, you know. So-

2236
02:27:34,762 --> 02:27:38,601
- But she could have maybe not liked him because she might have cared for Hitler. And you

2237
02:27:38,642 --> 02:27:42,522
can see the effects of drugs on humans that you care for.

2238
02:27:42,602 --> 02:27:46,322
- She also had a good relationship with him at times. Because he was often at the

2239
02:27:46,362 --> 02:27:52,442
Berghof. The Berghof was like the, what is it called? Mar-a-Lago. Um-

2240
02:27:52,462 --> 02:27:54,292
- Oh, the Mar-a-Lago? Yeah.

2241
02:27:54,322 --> 02:27:58,062
- Yeah, that was kind of what it was. And it was

2242
02:27:58,162 --> 02:28:01,682
actually, it became an official headquarters for Hitler so he would

2243
02:28:01,762 --> 02:28:05,742
actually make decisions from there. It was not just a vacation place. And

2244
02:28:05,782 --> 02:28:09,282
Morell was often there, and Eva Braun was always there. That was her

2245
02:28:09,382 --> 02:28:13,102
place. She was running that place. She was like the woman of that

2246
02:28:13,142 --> 02:28:17,052
place. And Hitler was often, of course, in the field in the headquarters, but

2247
02:28:17,082 --> 02:28:20,102
he came as much as he could to the Berghof because it's quite

2248
02:28:20,142 --> 02:28:23,462
beautiful. I went up there. It's quite interesting.

2249
02:28:23,602 --> 02:28:27,462
And she also had a good relationship with Morell, and there's like a paper

2250
02:28:27,502 --> 02:28:31,462
that I found where like they were

2251
02:28:31,502 --> 02:28:36,632
very intimate and very close. Like, there's a paper of Morell where

2252
02:28:37,462 --> 02:28:41,442
she comes to him in the morning and she has scratch

2253
02:28:41,522 --> 02:28:45,482
marks. So apparently, they had violent sex.

2254
02:28:45,542 --> 02:28:49,482
So Morell is also kind of a witness to that, that

2255
02:28:49,502 --> 02:28:51,372
that I found in Washington, DC in the National Archive.

2256
02:28:51,382 --> 02:28:55,182
- Wait, Hitler and Eva had violent sex? What do we know about Hitler's sex

2257
02:28:55,242 --> 02:28:57,482
life? It's like not known, right?

2258
02:28:57,582 --> 02:29:01,532
- I found it interesting that Morell describes these scratch marks.

2259
02:29:01,582 --> 02:29:05,502
I mean, it's interesting. So they had some kind of kinky sex

2260
02:29:05,602 --> 02:29:09,122
maybe. Maybe they also had normal sex and sometimes it was kinky, or-

2261
02:29:09,182 --> 02:29:12,262
Maybe Hitler was aggressive in bed, but it doesn't really

2262
02:29:12,402 --> 02:29:16,242
matter. It's just what happened between Eva and him.

2263
02:29:16,302 --> 02:29:19,922
- Yeah, I don't think that affected- ...military operations of the Wehrmacht.

2264
02:29:19,942 --> 02:29:23,822
- The drug use did. His sex... If he would have had sex with a

2265
02:29:23,982 --> 02:29:27,922
lot of people, maybe with his generals, maybe then, you know, it

2266
02:29:27,942 --> 02:29:31,852
would be worth writing about it because maybe he dominated these generals in bed or something.

2267
02:29:31,852 --> 02:29:34,972
But he was just having sex with Eva, and I don't think that's

2268
02:29:34,982 --> 02:29:38,712
historically relevant. It might be interesting for the movie, but

2269
02:29:38,802 --> 02:29:41,831
Also, I don't want to see Hitler having sex.

2270
02:29:41,831 --> 02:29:45,271
- I don't think anyone wants to see Hitler having sex.

2271
02:29:45,282 --> 02:29:49,122
- But Eva Braun is an interesting character because she had more of a

2272
02:29:49,242 --> 02:29:53,202
say than historians for a long time attributed to her. Then

2273
02:29:53,242 --> 02:29:56,872
a biography was written on her by a female German historian, and that's a very good

2274
02:29:56,902 --> 02:30:00,482
biography. It really shows that she had, you know, quite a lot to

2275
02:30:00,522 --> 02:30:03,382
say in this relationship. She was not the dumb blonde that

2276
02:30:03,442 --> 02:30:11,362
just... She was quite opinionated and active. And she was filming him a

2277
02:30:11,382 --> 02:30:15,362
lot. She was always filming in the Berghof. You can

2278
02:30:15,462 --> 02:30:19,422
go online and look at the Eva Braun clips, and you will see Hitler in

2279
02:30:19,462 --> 02:30:25,642
color at the Berghof, how he's meeting children, petting their head. And she was

2280
02:30:25,702 --> 02:30:29,642
contributing to the myth of this private, the good private

2281
02:30:29,742 --> 02:30:33,942
man. So Eva Braun is an interesting character for sure. But

2282
02:30:34,962 --> 02:30:38,162
I found one note that she, in the beginning when Morell started with his

2283
02:30:38,182 --> 02:30:42,012
drugs, said to Morell that she wants the

2284
02:30:42,222 --> 02:30:45,902
same medications, not drugs, the same medications as

2285
02:30:45,942 --> 02:30:49,822
Hitler so she would be on the same wavelength with him. She wanted

2286
02:30:49,862 --> 02:30:53,682
to be... She didn't want to lose this world. But,

2287
02:30:53,702 --> 02:30:57,602
Hitler became such a drug polytoxicomanic user that,

2288
02:30:57,662 --> 02:31:01,492
of course, Eva couldn't keep up with that. They weren't a drug couple. I didn't see

2289
02:31:01,502 --> 02:31:05,402
any evidence for that, that they would take all the crazy drugs together and then have crazy

2290
02:31:05,482 --> 02:31:09,382
sex or something like that. That's not how it was. So I think she was

2291
02:31:09,442 --> 02:31:12,362
sympathetic to Morell in the beginning and

2292
02:31:12,442 --> 02:31:16,242
then changed her opinion. And I'm pretty sure she

2293
02:31:16,262 --> 02:31:19,812
talked with Hitler about it, but there's no records about their private conversations.

2294
02:31:21,082 --> 02:31:25,062
- Let's talk about another perspective on this whole story that you document in

2295
02:31:25,102 --> 02:31:28,922
your book, 'The Bohemians.' The subtitle is, 'The Lovers Who Led Germany's

2296
02:31:29,022 --> 02:31:32,362
Resistance Against the Nazis. So this is the story

2297
02:31:32,642 --> 02:31:37,062
of the people who resisted from within Germany.

2298
02:31:37,182 --> 02:31:37,762
- Right.

2299
02:31:37,882 --> 02:31:41,682
- Can you tell their story? In particular, let's talk through the story of

2300
02:31:41,842 --> 02:31:49,622
the two key figures in the movement who-- ...happened to also be in love.

2301
02:31:49,722 --> 02:31:56,362
- Well, the main guy is Harro Schulze-Boysen.

2302
02:31:56,382 --> 02:31:59,522
He caught my attention when I was doing research in an archive in

2303
02:31:59,602 --> 02:32:03,432
Munich, researching drugs in the

2304
02:32:03,502 --> 02:32:07,222
Luftwaffe, Göring's Luftwaffe. Göring being the more, I mean,

2305
02:32:07,242 --> 02:32:10,592
the Luftwaffe was a drug...

2306
02:32:11,082 --> 02:32:15,402
very promiscuous place. A lot of people in the Luftwaffe were high.

2307
02:32:15,422 --> 02:32:18,702
- Oh, so more for entertainment versus the practical aspect?

2308
02:32:19,842 --> 02:32:23,762
So it's less about the meth optimizing human performance and more

2309
02:32:23,802 --> 02:32:26,782
about just exploring?

2310
02:32:26,802 --> 02:32:30,542
- Like the number three of the Luftwaffe, Ernst Udet, he committed

2311
02:32:30,622 --> 02:32:39,891
suicide in the fall of 1941. He had had seven Pervitin tablets for breakfast.

2312
02:32:39,942 --> 02:32:40,242
- Okay.

2313
02:32:40,282 --> 02:32:44,082
- So he was really high on meth. He really enjoyed it.

2314
02:32:44,102 --> 02:32:47,532
But he loved to take meth and then drink. Alcohol was a big thing in the Luftwaffe.

2315
02:32:47,642 --> 02:32:50,492
You can drink a lot more when you're on methamphetamine.

2316
02:32:50,622 --> 02:32:54,152
And I found this letter, and that was really a

2317
02:32:54,182 --> 02:32:57,912
coincidence, while I was looking through the drug stuff.

2318
02:32:57,962 --> 02:33:00,242
I was searching for drugs, and I found this letter by Harro

2319
02:33:00,322 --> 02:33:04,202
Schulze-Boysen, who had nothing to do with drugs,

2320
02:33:04,222 --> 02:33:07,791
but still, I found this letter. I don't know why, I can't remember how

2321
02:33:07,842 --> 02:33:11,622
exactly it happened that I was suddenly reading this letter, and it was the

2322
02:33:11,702 --> 02:33:14,782
last letter that he wrote in his life. He wrote it to his

2323
02:33:14,842 --> 02:33:17,782
father, and he said that, "Everything I have done,

2324
02:33:18,982 --> 02:33:22,952
I'm totally fine with it, and I know it's very hard for you,

2325
02:33:23,082 --> 02:33:28,762
and I really am mostly sad for you and mother and my brother,

2326
02:33:29,642 --> 02:33:33,442
that you have to go through this. I'm very sorry, but I'm fine with it,

2327
02:33:33,582 --> 02:33:36,772
and I have a clean conscience. I did what I could to stop this

2328
02:33:36,822 --> 02:33:40,502
madness." And I'm like, "What? Who is this guy?" I googled him, and there were not so many hits on

2329
02:33:40,602 --> 02:33:44,442
I googled him, and there were not so many hits on

2330
02:33:44,482 --> 02:33:48,242
him, but I read a little bit, and he actually had formed together with

2331
02:33:48,282 --> 02:33:51,662
his wife, Libertas, which means freedom--

2332
02:33:51,722 --> 02:33:52,782
- Good name.

2333
02:33:53,362 --> 02:33:56,742
- He had formed the largest resistance network

2334
02:33:57,002 --> 02:34:03,402
against the Nazis that ever existed. Over 100 people in Berlin that were all

2335
02:34:03,442 --> 02:34:12,302
connected, and they were, they were like from all flights of life.

2336
02:34:12,362 --> 02:34:15,902
Like, there were some artists, others were workers.

2337
02:34:15,972 --> 02:34:20,132
Some were leftists, others were patriots. Harro

2338
02:34:21,722 --> 02:34:25,622
always believed that people could come to an agreement,

2339
02:34:25,662 --> 02:34:28,922
like it's possible to actually talk about things,

2340
02:34:28,962 --> 02:34:32,922
and he was a, he was a true democrat, maybe

2341
02:34:32,942 --> 02:34:36,781
you could say, or a true, I don't know, libertarian.

2342
02:34:36,832 --> 02:34:43,762
He had to learn a hard lesson that with Nazis, you cannot

2343
02:34:44,862 --> 02:34:48,162
argue, because they, they are always right. They're not...

2344
02:34:48,172 --> 02:34:55,742
It doesn't work. At least it didn't work during the Third Reich. He had published a

2345
02:34:55,802 --> 02:34:59,402
newspaper during the Weimar Republic called Gegner, which means

2346
02:34:59,462 --> 02:35:03,342
opponent. And in the Gegner, opponents

2347
02:35:03,382 --> 02:35:07,372
could all write. Whoever were the street's opponents, they could all write in

2348
02:35:07,382 --> 02:35:11,262
The Opponent. And so you read all kinds

2349
02:35:11,302 --> 02:35:15,052
of texts and opinions, and he thought when Hitler took over

2350
02:35:15,162 --> 02:35:19,122
power in '33 that he could continue to publish The Opponent, because he

2351
02:35:19,132 --> 02:35:22,892
thought even in a Nazi-led Germany, you know,

2352
02:35:22,922 --> 02:35:26,582
this keeps the discourse. You have to have a discourse. We have to discuss.

2353
02:35:26,602 --> 02:35:30,351
We have to disagree, you know. And then in April

2354
02:35:30,422 --> 02:35:33,862
1933, two months after Hitler took power,

2355
02:35:34,622 --> 02:35:38,562
they had a meeting with the editorial staff. They discussed

2356
02:35:38,602 --> 02:35:42,162
the new issue, and then there was a knock on the door. It was the SS, and

2357
02:35:42,222 --> 02:35:45,812
they beat up everybody and they destroyed the

2358
02:35:45,902 --> 02:35:49,532
typewriters and the printing press that they had in the office in Berlin. They

2359
02:35:49,582 --> 02:35:52,842
took Harro and his best friend, who was half

2360
02:35:52,882 --> 02:35:56,642
Jewish, to one of these early concentration camps, and they

2361
02:35:56,702 --> 02:36:00,382
tortured both of them, and the Jew was killed.

2362
02:36:00,422 --> 02:36:04,242
He didn't make it. Henry Erlanger and Harro, at that

2363
02:36:04,282 --> 02:36:07,522
moment, he realized who he was against. He realized that he has

2364
02:36:07,582 --> 02:36:10,542
to... He decided to become... to fight the

2365
02:36:10,602 --> 02:36:15,332
system. And the way he fought the system was

2366
02:36:16,562 --> 02:36:20,742
later during the '60s. We also had a '60s cultural

2367
02:36:22,502 --> 02:36:25,982
and political changes in Germany. And then our '60s,

2368
02:36:26,082 --> 02:36:29,182
they called it "March through the Institutions."

2369
02:36:29,222 --> 02:36:33,022
That is a way to infiltrate the system, to become

2370
02:36:33,062 --> 02:36:36,922
part of the system, and then, you know, change

2371
02:36:37,022 --> 02:36:40,662
the system from within. So you don't leave the country, you

2372
02:36:40,902 --> 02:36:44,782
stay, you go into the institutions. You march through the

2373
02:36:44,822 --> 02:36:48,562
institutions. So Harro decided to go into the

2374
02:36:48,602 --> 02:36:52,402
Luftwaffe, and he was working in the Luftwaffe Ministry, a

2375
02:36:52,502 --> 02:36:55,571
huge building still intact today in Berlin

2376
02:36:55,602 --> 02:36:59,322
Wilhelmstrasse. Quite an interesting building that was like the

2377
02:36:59,362 --> 02:37:03,062
power center of the Luftwaffe, or like one of the most important

2378
02:37:03,642 --> 02:37:10,042
structures in the whole Nazi regime. And he was working there, and he worked his way

2379
02:37:10,162 --> 02:37:13,572
up, and he received quite a lot of

2380
02:37:13,602 --> 02:37:16,752
information. For example, when Germany, for the first time,

2381
02:37:17,462 --> 02:37:21,162
became militarily active again. This was in 1936, when the

2382
02:37:21,202 --> 02:37:25,182
Germans supported the fascists in Spain in the Spanish Civil

2383
02:37:25,302 --> 02:37:29,222
War. This was a clandestine operation. The Luftwaffe did

2384
02:37:29,242 --> 02:37:33,122
this, and German soldiers went to Spain like in plain clothes,

2385
02:37:33,202 --> 02:37:36,722
posing as vacationers. But then they, you know, were actually soldiers and supporting

2386
02:37:36,762 --> 02:37:40,462
vacationers. But then they, you know, were actually soldiers and supporting

2387
02:37:41,222 --> 02:37:45,162
Franco's... You know, were part of Franco's victory later on. And Harro had this

2388
02:37:45,202 --> 02:37:52,582
information, and he tried to pass this on to the BBC. He failed passing it on. He

2389
02:37:52,662 --> 02:37:55,792
met a BBC journalist during the Olympic Games in Berlin,

2390
02:37:55,982 --> 02:37:59,502
and told him about this, and the BBC guy was too afraid to make this public,

2391
02:37:59,582 --> 02:38:03,282
and he kind of buried that information.

2392
02:38:03,342 --> 02:38:07,292
So Harro is just a very interesting character,

2393
02:38:07,362 --> 02:38:11,072
and he was in love with Libertas, and Libertas with him. Harro came from

2394
02:38:11,122 --> 02:38:15,022
Libertas with him. Harro came from like a bourgeois family, very educated.

2395
02:38:15,082 --> 02:38:18,882
very educated. His great granduncle was von Tirpitz, who built up the marine,

2396
02:38:18,892 --> 02:38:22,222
von Tirpitz, who built up the marine, the Navy for the Kaiser.

2397
02:38:22,262 --> 02:38:26,142
So he came from this influential German family, but they were all patriots.

2398
02:38:26,262 --> 02:38:30,082
They were not Nazis. They were democrats, patriots, and militarists,

2399
02:38:30,162 --> 02:38:34,082
patriots, and militarists, I guess you could say, or even,

2400
02:38:34,242 --> 02:38:38,222
you know, very straight-laced also. And Libertas, she came from

2401
02:38:38,232 --> 02:38:41,522
And Libertas, she came from a castle north of Berlin. She was this bohemian,

2402
02:38:41,582 --> 02:38:44,822
like aristocratic Bohemian type. She's very good-looking,

2403
02:38:44,862 --> 02:38:48,442
always playing music. And they fell in love. They met on the Wannsee on boats.

2404
02:38:48,502 --> 02:38:52,322
love. They met on the Wannsee on boats. They were both on...

2405
02:38:52,442 --> 02:38:55,322
Harro was rowing, and she was on a sailboat of a guy that Harro also knew.

2406
02:38:56,302 --> 02:39:00,002
So he was rowing and he saw his friend on the sailboat. He looked at Libertas,

2407
02:39:00,101 --> 02:39:04,042
on the sailboat. He looked at Libertas, she looked at him, and they were in love

2408
02:39:04,062 --> 02:39:05,542
in love in 1934.

2409
02:39:06,782 --> 02:39:10,642
And the other guy, the friend of Harro, he left his sailboat, because he realized,

2410
02:39:10,681 --> 02:39:14,421
"I'm like the fifth wheel on the car, not really needed," right?

2411
02:39:14,442 --> 02:39:17,782
"not really needed," right? How do you say that in sailboat terms?

2412
02:39:17,841 --> 02:39:21,231
I don't know, the third sail is not needed.

2413
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:25,062
But what happened at night, Harro didn't sleep with Libertas. For her, that was

2414
02:39:25,142 --> 02:39:27,021
sleep with Libertas. For her, that was very unusual because everyone wanted

2415
02:39:28,082 --> 02:39:32,042
very unusual because everyone wanted to sleep with her, but Harro wanted to keep

2416
02:39:32,062 --> 02:39:36,021
his clothes on, and it was a very warm night. I researched this quite thoroughly.

2417
02:39:36,062 --> 02:39:39,952
I know exactly the temperature. So also, when you read The Bohemians,

2418
02:39:40,101 --> 02:39:43,482
when you read The Bohemians, you really experience the life of these people,

2419
02:39:43,521 --> 02:39:46,942
what they experienced, but everything is nothing is invented, which is

2420
02:39:46,982 --> 02:39:50,931
is nothing is invented, which is very tricky to do. So what happens that night,

2421
02:39:50,962 --> 02:39:54,782
tricky to do. So what happens that night, Libertas wants to take off his clothes,

2422
02:39:54,822 --> 02:39:58,681
Libertas wants to take off his clothes, and he doesn't want to take them off.

2423
02:39:58,722 --> 02:40:02,681
Why? From the torture in April 1933, he has quite a lot of scars.

2424
02:40:02,702 --> 02:40:05,761
he has quite a lot of scars. They even burned swastikas into his thighs.

2425
02:40:05,962 --> 02:40:11,232
burned swastikas into his thighs. Like, not burned, sorry, with knives.

2426
02:40:11,421 --> 02:40:15,402
the SS. So he doesn't want to show that to her. He hadn't had a girlfriend

2427
02:40:15,482 --> 02:40:19,442
to her. He hadn't had a girlfriend for a while. He can't open up

2428
02:40:19,521 --> 02:40:23,402
emotionally, because he's fighting the Nazis. It's very secret. No one knows

2429
02:40:23,482 --> 02:40:27,362
about this, that he's long-term planning his life to fight the system

2430
02:40:27,421 --> 02:40:30,702
that he hates so much because they killed his best friend in front of his eyes.

2431
02:40:30,782 --> 02:40:34,572
But at one point, Libertas does, you know, take off his clothes and she sees

2432
02:40:34,622 --> 02:40:38,502
this, and she's naive. She's even a member of the Nazi party, but she's not a very

2433
02:40:38,542 --> 02:40:42,382
of the Nazi party, but she's not a very active party member. She just, you know,

2434
02:40:42,442 --> 02:40:46,412
she works for MGM actually in Berlin. A Hollywood film studio office in Berlin,

2435
02:40:46,421 --> 02:40:49,972
A Hollywood film studio office in Berlin, Germany was one of the biggest movie

2436
02:40:50,062 --> 02:40:54,042
markets, and she was the press girl. She did the campaigns for the big

2437
02:40:54,082 --> 02:40:57,681
Hollywood movies in Germany.

2438
02:40:57,702 --> 02:40:59,202
- So just a regular German girl?

2439
02:40:59,642 --> 02:41:03,431
- Well, she wasn't regular. She was from a very high family. Actually, her grandfather

2440
02:41:03,582 --> 02:41:07,502
had been in a relationship with the German.

2441
02:41:07,582 --> 02:41:11,521
emperor, which is a side story that I found out when I researched The Bohemians.

2442
02:41:11,542 --> 02:41:15,032
The German emperor apparently was

2443
02:41:15,142 --> 02:41:18,761
bisexual and was going to that castle, and they had

2444
02:41:19,222 --> 02:41:23,181
homosexual kind of meetings there with Libertas' grandfather.

2445
02:41:23,222 --> 02:41:28,032
So she came from a very... ...Unusual family.

2446
02:41:28,122 --> 02:41:32,382
- Yeah. But what I mean by a usual German girl...

2447
02:41:33,242 --> 02:41:37,142
What I mean by that is it's not obvious that a person like that

2448
02:41:37,662 --> 02:41:41,912
would hold a crucial role in the resistance against the Nazis.

2449
02:41:42,042 --> 02:41:45,862
- No, not at all. That was always a problem because for her, it was

2450
02:41:45,982 --> 02:41:49,642
weird that someone was against the system. But

2451
02:41:49,802 --> 02:41:53,742
Harro told me... Harro was totally convinced that fascism is wrong

2452
02:41:53,782 --> 02:41:55,402
and that he has to fight it.

2453
02:41:56,341 --> 02:41:59,521
More and more Libertas was convinced, and then more friends

2454
02:41:59,642 --> 02:42:06,761
came into the group. And the way Harro organized this resistance group was through

2455
02:42:06,802 --> 02:42:10,652
parties. They were like a power couple of Berlin, and they had

2456
02:42:10,841 --> 02:42:14,502
a great loft apartment. They moved together to a loft apartment

2457
02:42:14,562 --> 02:42:18,351
on also a side street from Ku'damm, a huge

2458
02:42:18,442 --> 02:42:22,312
room, and there they had parties every second Thursday night, and they would

2459
02:42:22,341 --> 02:42:29,472
invite friends. Then once they trusted someone personally, then they would

2460
02:42:29,482 --> 02:42:32,841
spill the beans and say, "This is actually not just a

2461
02:42:32,882 --> 02:42:36,542
party." But they would test it. At the party, they would

2462
02:42:36,601 --> 02:42:40,421
say something critical of the regime, and you immediately, you know,

2463
02:42:40,462 --> 02:42:44,002
either the person jumps on it, responds, or

2464
02:42:44,062 --> 02:42:47,812
you know, goes somewhere else, gets a drink at the bar. Not into it.

2465
02:42:47,921 --> 02:42:51,912
So that was the way of recruiting people, and that was

2466
02:42:51,962 --> 02:42:55,681
such an efficient way that the Gestapo was not able to

2467
02:42:55,722 --> 02:42:59,552
understand this group for a long time, not even recognize that there's a group,

2468
02:42:59,582 --> 02:43:03,502
because Gestapo was very good at infiltrating,

2469
02:43:03,541 --> 02:43:07,442
for example, communist resistance groups, because you just had to go in as a

2470
02:43:07,481 --> 02:43:11,181
Gestapo guy and be a communist.

2471
02:43:11,261 --> 02:43:14,322
Just say the right words and they would, at one point, you know, take

2472
02:43:14,402 --> 02:43:18,242
you. But with Harro and Libertas, it wasn't so easy, you know.

2473
02:43:18,282 --> 02:43:20,021
They would sniff you out.

2474
02:43:20,032 --> 02:43:26,382
- These parties were what, like intellectuals? Like artists and that kind of stuff?

2475
02:43:26,642 --> 02:43:30,521
- Yeah, yeah. They had music, they would dance, they would sleep

2476
02:43:30,722 --> 02:43:31,892
with each other. They also...

2477
02:43:31,902 --> 02:43:33,681
- Oh, sex stuff too.

2478
02:43:33,742 --> 02:43:37,722
- Well, they had... and this is, again, kind of a parallel to the '60s.

2479
02:43:37,782 --> 02:43:42,162
They had the idea that if you're against fascism, if you're for

2480
02:43:43,802 --> 02:43:45,662
freedom of everything...

2481
02:43:45,702 --> 02:43:46,101
- Yeah, free love, the whole thing.

2482
02:43:46,261 --> 02:43:50,202
- ...yeah, they had free love, but it wasn't a dogma. There was also

2483
02:43:50,242 --> 02:43:53,942
a female doctor there. She was quite square, I guess you would say.

2484
02:43:54,261 --> 02:43:58,132
square, I guess you would say, and she was, like, against this and she said, "This is

2485
02:43:58,142 --> 02:44:02,011
too complicated. We are a resistance group, like, what

2486
02:44:02,062 --> 02:44:06,052
if there's jealousy and what..." This could compromise operations.

2487
02:44:06,062 --> 02:44:09,782
And it did sometimes. That's why The Bohemians are a very interesting subject,

2488
02:44:09,822 --> 02:44:13,502
because sometimes it just doesn't work. In a way it works that love really

2489
02:44:13,521 --> 02:44:14,652
bonds them together.

2490
02:44:15,362 --> 02:44:19,181
But also especially Libertas and Harro, they have a terrible marriage sometimes.

2491
02:44:19,222 --> 02:44:23,222
They really fight, because Libertas is not so much

2492
02:44:24,822 --> 02:44:28,482
intellectually convinced. She's more of a resistance fighter from the

2493
02:44:28,601 --> 02:44:32,562
heart, like, she feels that the Nazis are not good, but Harro is more like the

2494
02:44:32,601 --> 02:44:36,472
analytical guy. So they have a lot of friction also, and it's a...

2495
02:44:36,521 --> 02:44:42,742
It's a fascinating story. And they came quite far. They made...

2496
02:44:42,802 --> 02:44:46,771
There was a point in time when Harro had militarily relevant information

2497
02:44:46,841 --> 02:44:50,582
through his position at the Luftwaffe ministry, and he passed that

2498
02:44:50,722 --> 02:44:54,261
on to allies, to Western allies and to the Soviet Union.

2499
02:44:55,062 --> 02:44:58,642
So he went a step further than just being a

2500
02:44:58,681 --> 02:45:03,310
resistance group. He became, you could say, a traitor, or...

2501
02:45:03,349 --> 02:45:04,990
- He would give information to the Soviets.

2502
02:45:05,070 --> 02:45:07,099
- Yeah, he would, because he said,

2503
02:45:07,250 --> 02:45:08,429
- As part of the resistance.

2504
02:45:08,470 --> 02:45:12,340
- Yeah, they can beat Germany. But that was also discussed in the groups.

2505
02:45:12,369 --> 02:45:16,019
Very interesting to see, like, some say, "We can't do this 'cause the Soviet Union's

2506
02:45:16,109 --> 02:45:19,750
also a totalitarian regime." But then Harro

2507
02:45:19,810 --> 02:45:23,710
says, "Yeah, but they are going to beat Hitler." So, it's...

2508
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:26,429
The Bohemians is a very interesting topic.

2509
02:45:26,550 --> 02:45:31,510
- What lessons do you learn from these folks, maybe about

2510
02:45:33,810 --> 02:45:38,029
why so few resisted Hitler while in Germany?

2511
02:45:38,109 --> 02:45:40,269
- I mean, it was extremely dangerous.

2512
02:45:40,369 --> 02:45:44,210
- It's purely the danger? Is it also people believed

2513
02:45:44,269 --> 02:45:48,189
it's hard to take yourself, like, be an independent

2514
02:45:48,230 --> 02:45:53,349
thinker and take yourself outside the propaganda? 'Cause they're also swimming in

2515
02:45:53,390 --> 02:45:55,609
propaganda.

2516
02:45:55,689 --> 02:45:59,250
- I mean, the chances of succeeding are quite

2517
02:45:59,310 --> 02:46:03,170
small, 'cause the system was extremely strong. And

2518
02:46:03,810 --> 02:46:07,390
if you made a joke about Hitler and the wrong person heard it, like, in a

2519
02:46:07,470 --> 02:46:08,650
restaurant and would

2520
02:46:10,029 --> 02:46:13,910
rat on you, you would land in a concentration camp. So, people were very, very

2521
02:46:14,109 --> 02:46:18,029
careful. Also, at parties, with how Libertas was singing

2522
02:46:18,090 --> 02:46:22,080
and they were drinking and dancing, and then suddenly the political discussion started,

2523
02:46:22,109 --> 02:46:26,080
that's... You know you have to have guts to then actually not

2524
02:46:26,150 --> 02:46:30,090
leave the party but to stay, because they were rising their lives, basically.

2525
02:46:30,130 --> 02:46:32,429
As soon as they would be found out, they would be dead.

2526
02:46:33,289 --> 02:46:37,250
And people don't want to die when they're in their mid-20s. They were pretty young.

2527
02:46:37,289 --> 02:46:40,830
And Libertas would often say, like, "We can't

2528
02:46:40,910 --> 02:46:44,900
win. You know, why are we risking our lives for

2529
02:46:44,929 --> 02:46:49,760
what, you know?" So, one time they did a...

2530
02:46:51,369 --> 02:46:54,910
Gelbe Sättel Aktion, Gelbe Sättel. Like, they

2531
02:46:55,070 --> 02:46:58,949
produced... 'cause one guy had access to a printing press, and they

2532
02:46:58,970 --> 02:47:06,990
produced leaflets, like, small papers that had glue on one side, and the paper said,

2533
02:47:08,169 --> 02:47:12,119
what the Nazis did, they set up a huge

2534
02:47:12,230 --> 02:47:16,140
exhibition hall, which was called the Soviet Paradise, and

2535
02:47:16,170 --> 02:47:19,220
And this exhibition always in the center of Berlin. I'd never heard about this before.

2536
02:47:19,269 --> 02:47:22,769
I found this when I researched the Bohemians, and it was the most popular

2537
02:47:22,810 --> 02:47:26,140
exhibition during the whole of the, of the war.

2538
02:47:26,170 --> 02:47:29,910
Like, two million people, two million Germans saw this. They went

2539
02:47:29,970 --> 02:47:33,840
into this exhibition, and they saw how horrible the

2540
02:47:33,890 --> 02:47:39,609
Soviet Union is, how horrible communism is to people. So, it was a propaganda show.

2541
02:47:39,630 --> 02:47:43,480
And the group decided to make these leaflets

2542
02:47:43,570 --> 02:47:47,429
which didn't say "The Soviet Paradise," but it said "The Nazi

2543
02:47:47,490 --> 02:47:53,890
Paradise," torture, SS torture, hunger, war, how long will it

2544
02:47:53,949 --> 02:47:57,730
last? And they glued over a thousand of these

2545
02:47:57,970 --> 02:48:02,029
stickers everywhere in Berlin in May 1942,

2546
02:48:03,250 --> 02:48:07,130
at night, and they organized it in a way that they, always two, a

2547
02:48:07,189 --> 02:48:11,130
man and a woman would go out, and they had, like, the stickers with them, and then they

2548
02:48:11,170 --> 02:48:15,090
would pretend to kiss and would, like, lean on a wall. And then while they were

2549
02:48:15,150 --> 02:48:19,140
kissing, one would, like, put the sticker on. Then they would move on

2550
02:48:19,310 --> 02:48:24,090
in the dark. So, in the morning of that May 1942,

2551
02:48:25,109 --> 02:48:28,179
tens of thousands of Berliners saw that the city was, like,

2552
02:48:28,210 --> 02:48:32,070
saw these things. So, does it make a

2553
02:48:32,130 --> 02:48:35,820
difference? It made one on that day, you know? It was a

2554
02:48:35,849 --> 02:48:39,079
very dangerous thing to do, and no one was, no one got

2555
02:48:39,130 --> 02:48:42,789
caught. And in the morning, a lot of people saw that there is actually

2556
02:48:42,830 --> 02:48:46,609
resistance, that there are people who do something against it. So, I

2557
02:48:46,630 --> 02:48:48,830
think they did something.

2558
02:48:48,869 --> 02:48:56,380
- Yeah, I was reading about protests in recent human history,

2559
02:48:56,380 --> 02:49:05,429
and most of them, many of them, don't have an effect until they do. It's like this threshold effect.

2560
02:49:05,490 --> 02:49:06,689
It's very hard to know.

2561
02:49:07,789 --> 02:49:10,689
It's very hard to know because it's, it's a match that lights a fire.

2562
02:49:10,730 --> 02:49:14,720
And sometimes the spark, it takes a little bit of time

2563
02:49:14,750 --> 02:49:18,349
to propagate through the whispers. What happens is the people

2564
02:49:18,368 --> 02:49:22,090
whispering, it's the whisper network of people talking, and sometimes it

2565
02:49:22,189 --> 02:49:26,050
just takes that one sticker to begin the whispers,

2566
02:49:26,090 --> 02:49:29,938
and then a few months later, the regime is overthrown. It's funny.

2567
02:49:29,949 --> 02:49:35,590
But it's hard to sort of trace back what was effective and what was not.

2568
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:38,179
- I mean, Harro was convinced that the system would lose,

2569
02:49:39,529 --> 02:49:43,510
so he thought that maybe we can make a contribution that it's

2570
02:49:43,550 --> 02:49:48,529
going faster. Maybe we will be that spark. So-

2571
02:49:48,550 --> 02:49:52,019
Unless, when I think that there's this possibility, I

2572
02:49:52,050 --> 02:49:56,029
must try it, you know? That's, that was his conviction. So, he would put his life

2573
02:49:56,070 --> 02:49:59,019
on the line for that possibility.

2574
02:49:59,070 --> 02:50:00,990
- How did they get caught?

2575
02:50:01,060 --> 02:50:06,170
- They were approached by the Soviet Union, who wanted to recruit them as spies.

2576
02:50:06,210 --> 02:50:12,010
And they didn't want to do that. Harro refused the Soviet

2577
02:50:12,970 --> 02:50:16,890
intelligence. These are documents that were found

2578
02:50:18,090 --> 02:50:21,890
in the early '90s. One of the sons of one of the

2579
02:50:21,929 --> 02:50:25,910
members of that group of Harro's, a good friend of Harro, one of his sons

2580
02:50:25,970 --> 02:50:29,938
went to Moscow to look at the files, and he found a kind of

2581
02:50:30,609 --> 02:50:34,449
furious Soviet KGB kind of descriptions of

2582
02:50:34,510 --> 02:50:38,438
this weird guy, Harro, that doesn't want to be a proper Soviet spy and just

2583
02:50:38,449 --> 02:50:42,429
says, "Yes, I'm going to give you information so you can hurt Hitler, but I'm not going to

2584
02:50:42,470 --> 02:50:46,289
play your game. I'm not going to be one of you." So,

2585
02:50:47,449 --> 02:50:53,609
still they did collaborate with the Soviet Union. They accepted a

2586
02:50:53,689 --> 02:50:57,550
radio transmitter from the Soviet Union with,

2587
02:50:57,590 --> 02:51:04,086
with which they were supposed to send military information via radio to Moscow,

2588
02:51:05,246 --> 02:51:09,106
and they struggle with the technology. The Russians give

2589
02:51:09,145 --> 02:51:13,006
them, like, an apparatus only with a Russian instruction, and it's,

2590
02:51:13,016 --> 02:51:16,786
like, very difficult. They make mistakes. But what actually then gets them

2591
02:51:16,866 --> 02:51:20,626
caught is the Russians at one point answer and

2592
02:51:20,725 --> 02:51:27,545
send a message to them through the ether, and that message is decoded. But

2593
02:51:27,606 --> 02:51:33,346
the Nazis intercept that message and are able to

2594
02:51:33,366 --> 02:51:37,346
decode it. And in the message, it gives the clear names of

2595
02:51:37,385 --> 02:51:42,565
Harro and his address, which is a total intelligence blunder. Or

2596
02:51:44,346 --> 02:51:47,876
maybe they just wanted to give them up, and had their revenge because

2597
02:51:47,905 --> 02:51:51,715
Stalin did crazy stuff like that, you know?

2598
02:51:51,766 --> 02:51:55,286
So they suddenly know, the Gestapo knows Harro Schulze-Boysen, the

2599
02:51:55,346 --> 02:51:59,045
high-ranking officer in the Luftwaffe ministry is giving military

2600
02:51:59,126 --> 02:52:02,446
information to the Soviet Union, and

2601
02:52:02,485 --> 02:52:06,286
apparently, he's meeting with all kinds of friends. So the Gestapo

2602
02:52:06,405 --> 02:52:10,276
started observing the group for months. And the group at

2603
02:52:10,385 --> 02:52:14,026
one point realizes that they've been basically found out,

2604
02:52:14,106 --> 02:52:17,946
and then it's already too late. Then they capture quite a few

2605
02:52:18,026 --> 02:52:24,286
of them, and quite a few get trial, military trial, and receive the death

2606
02:52:24,346 --> 02:52:31,484
penalty, and are also being executed. And Harro and Libertas are among them.

2607
02:52:31,555 --> 02:52:36,645
And also, that last chapter of their lives is very

2608
02:52:36,826 --> 02:52:40,126
well-documented, and it actually ends with that letter, you know, that I found in the

2609
02:52:40,145 --> 02:52:44,626
beginning. That's the last thing that Harro does, is write that letter.

2610
02:52:44,645 --> 02:52:45,225
- To his father.

2611
02:52:45,266 --> 02:52:49,086
- That's very interesting what happens with Libertas because she gets in

2612
02:52:49,126 --> 02:52:56,356
custody. The Gestapo asks one of their secretaries, Gertrude

2613
02:52:56,526 --> 02:53:00,516
Breiter, to go in and pose as a friend to Libertas. And

2614
02:53:00,545 --> 02:53:03,926
Libertas actually falls for it, and starts telling that

2615
02:53:03,965 --> 02:53:07,426
secretary who pretends to be her friend and kind of helps her with certain

2616
02:53:07,526 --> 02:53:11,474
things, tells her secrets, and that kind of breaks the neck of the

2617
02:53:11,545 --> 02:53:17,905
group. It's a very tragic ending. So while my books always

2618
02:53:17,946 --> 02:53:21,885
contain as much humor as possible, that is not a

2619
02:53:21,946 --> 02:53:25,905
funny story, but it's a very dramatic story.

2620
02:53:25,965 --> 02:53:29,686
Even though they had a lot of humor, obviously. I mean, they had

2621
02:53:29,746 --> 02:53:31,606
parties to recruit people.

2622
02:53:31,645 --> 02:53:38,126
- What lessons can we learn from that about how to resist totalitarian

2623
02:53:38,206 --> 02:53:42,946
regimes? Is there some deeper wisdom?

2624
02:53:44,846 --> 02:53:54,086
- I just think it's admirable to be brave and not do things that you cannot really

2625
02:53:55,426 --> 02:53:57,985
justify in front of your own conscience.

2626
02:53:58,946 --> 02:54:02,746
I don't know if I would have been so brave. I don't even know how my conscience would

2627
02:54:02,786 --> 02:54:03,526
have been, but

2628
02:54:04,366 --> 02:54:07,846
I'm probably more the fleeing type. Like, a lot of writers would just leave

2629
02:54:07,926 --> 02:54:12,506
Germany. Like Thomas Mann just left Germany and lived in Pacific Palisades.

2630
02:54:12,516 --> 02:54:16,826
- And then, and then maybe write, criticize, but leave first.

2631
02:54:16,866 --> 02:54:20,766
- And he criticized it from the outside, and he was quite influential.

2632
02:54:20,805 --> 02:54:24,305
He worked for the BBC. They did shows against the Nazis. So you can

2633
02:54:24,385 --> 02:54:28,366
Maybe you could do more when you leave. It's just you

2634
02:54:28,405 --> 02:54:32,346
have... Like today, let's say we see something. We live in a

2635
02:54:32,385 --> 02:54:36,305
system that suddenly changes, and we're not happy with it anymore.

2636
02:54:36,326 --> 02:54:40,225
Do we just go along and, you know, continue to stare

2637
02:54:40,246 --> 02:54:44,506
at our smartphone, or do we do something against it? What do we do?

2638
02:54:45,405 --> 02:54:49,126
I mean, every situation has very different, you know,

2639
02:54:50,746 --> 02:54:54,506
conditions, you know. I think it's probably even harder now

2640
02:54:54,626 --> 02:54:58,106
to be in the resistance than it was back then.

2641
02:54:58,145 --> 02:55:02,065
- But I think it does, at the end of the day, boil down to facing yourself,

2642
02:55:02,106 --> 02:55:03,225
looking yourself in the mirror—

2643
02:55:03,246 --> 02:55:10,746
that you're facing your conscience and doing the courageous thing.

2644
02:55:10,766 --> 02:55:14,666
And I think that in itself, that it's the

2645
02:55:14,725 --> 02:55:18,545
tree falling in the forest, even if there's nobody there to hear it.

2646
02:55:18,606 --> 02:55:24,526
Just the fact that that exists, somehow through the karma channels of the world—

2647
02:55:24,536 --> 02:55:31,936
can materialize into progress, into a revolution against

2648
02:55:31,965 --> 02:55:37,596
oppression. Something about that human spirit still shining through

2649
02:55:38,725 --> 02:55:39,926
can start a revolution.

2650
02:55:40,846 --> 02:55:44,554
- I mean, it is that spirit that actually made us human.

2651
02:55:44,554 --> 02:55:52,706
It is that neuroplasticity in our brain that we

2652
02:55:56,206 --> 02:56:00,526
we do not just repeat the conditioned

2653
02:56:03,126 --> 02:56:08,086
sets that we ought to repeat. But that we actually

2654
02:56:09,426 --> 02:56:13,346
dim down the command center in the brain and let other parts of the brain

2655
02:56:13,426 --> 02:56:20,866
react, which is the psychedelic experience, basically. That, I think,

2656
02:56:20,905 --> 02:56:24,516
contributes to the evolution of our species. And our

2657
02:56:24,565 --> 02:56:30,965
species is certainly threatened by extinction. So I think if we

2658
02:56:31,006 --> 02:56:35,086
somehow care for the human race,

2659
02:56:36,766 --> 02:56:43,926
then resistance becomes a very immediate and important

2660
02:56:43,936 --> 02:56:47,846
topic, you know. Because you can resist, obviously. Your brain

2661
02:56:47,905 --> 02:56:51,776
is yours. You can resist in many ways, you know,

2662
02:56:51,786 --> 02:56:55,326
by thinking, just by thinking. That's why I became a writer when I was a teenager.

2663
02:56:55,366 --> 02:56:59,266
I was very political. I wanted to change the system. I thought, "This is not

2664
02:56:59,305 --> 02:57:03,336
good what's happening." This was in the Cold War. Very conservative—

2665
02:57:04,186 --> 02:57:07,446
I don't know if conservative is even the right word, but Ronald Reagan was

2666
02:57:07,485 --> 02:57:11,412
president. So I thought my writing...

2667
02:57:11,412 --> 02:57:16,462
could change the brain waves of the readers basically, and therefore have

2668
02:57:17,502 --> 02:57:21,022
a neuroplastic effect on the reader.

2669
02:57:21,082 --> 02:57:23,962
And just because that is what literature is. Literature,

2670
02:57:24,982 --> 02:57:28,702
and I started off as a novelist, and that's really literature. It's

2671
02:57:28,782 --> 02:57:35,952
about what do you see right now? How do you describe it? So you do it in ways that

2672
02:57:36,002 --> 02:57:39,762
when you read it, when you read a good book, you feel good because suddenly you

2673
02:57:40,422 --> 02:57:44,182
see different things, your brain changes. You become more free, I think, if you

2674
02:57:44,262 --> 02:57:47,562
read good literature. That was always my form

2675
02:57:47,642 --> 02:57:51,282
of resistance. Communist resistance cells would

2676
02:57:51,402 --> 02:57:55,312
probably say this is nothing, you know, but I think it is resistance. And that's a

2677
02:57:55,382 --> 02:58:00,911
little bit... I- I think it resembles a little bit what this group did.

2678
02:58:02,382 --> 02:58:03,662
Just living differently,

2679
02:58:04,582 --> 02:58:08,282
not living, you know... That's why I said in the beginning, Nazis were

2680
02:58:08,542 --> 02:58:10,202
bad dancers, because they-

2681
02:58:11,002 --> 02:58:14,962
... I think they were good dancers at the parties, you know, and they were like,

2682
02:58:15,062 --> 02:58:19,182
I think it's big. Dancing can be a form of resistance.

2683
02:58:19,262 --> 02:58:23,202
- Yeah, but I also like the scale

2684
02:58:23,262 --> 02:58:27,002
when you resist and through that resistance you have impact at

2685
02:58:27,102 --> 02:58:31,042
scale, and I do think writing is that. So if you can encapsulate

2686
02:58:32,702 --> 02:58:36,302
your, sort of the spirit of that resistance into writing, that's- that's

2687
02:58:36,382 --> 02:58:39,522
beautiful. And some of the greatest literature does exactly that.

2688
02:58:39,622 --> 02:58:43,122
- Right. That is the aim of my next book.

2689
02:58:43,182 --> 02:58:45,522
- So is it still called Stoned Sapiens?

2690
02:58:45,602 --> 02:58:46,902
- Yeah, it's called Stoned Sapiens.

2691
02:58:46,922 --> 02:58:50,332
- Great title, great title. So what- what is this

2692
02:58:50,422 --> 02:58:54,782
lens that you're looking at- at all of human history through?

2693
02:58:54,862 --> 02:58:58,762
- I discussed this with already mentioned Antony Beevor

2694
02:58:58,802 --> 02:59:02,762
who is like the master in historical non-fiction books and said, "Is it also possible to write a

2695
02:59:02,822 --> 02:59:06,642
world history?" Like, about everything, basically. And he said, "Yes, it is

2696
02:59:06,702 --> 02:59:10,582
possible." It's not easy, because you have to understand like a

2697
02:59:10,662 --> 02:59:16,722
lot, you know? And obviously it will always be a selection.

2698
02:59:16,742 --> 02:59:20,692
It's clear, you know. That's why I also

2699
02:59:20,722 --> 02:59:24,522
think that the historical science is basically a fictional

2700
02:59:24,622 --> 02:59:28,442
science. I mean, I have a foreword, the Blitz foreword basically tells that

2701
02:59:28,522 --> 02:59:32,242
story. Don't... Take it with a grain of salt. Not only Blitz, but every historical

2702
02:59:32,342 --> 02:59:36,322
book, because we weren't there, you know? That's what Johnny Depp said when the-

2703
02:59:36,342 --> 02:59:40,712
when the- when the guy said, "So you had like a mega pint of- of red wine."

2704
02:59:40,722 --> 02:59:42,332
He just said, "Were you there?"

2705
02:59:42,332 --> 02:59:49,282
You know, and the guy wasn't there. So... history, historical sciences is

2706
02:59:49,542 --> 02:59:54,922
a fiction. But, you know, it- it's a certain type of fiction, and it- it's based on

2707
02:59:54,982 --> 02:59:57,822
facts. So I'm not inventing anything in Stoned

2708
02:59:57,922 --> 03:00:01,302
Sapiens, and I'm highly interested in the very

2709
03:00:01,402 --> 03:00:05,302
early human history, and there are not a

2710
03:00:05,362 --> 03:00:08,722
lot of sources. So the- the beginning of the book

2711
03:00:10,782 --> 03:00:14,762
is more speculative than, for example, the Vietnam War chapter. In the

2712
03:00:14,822 --> 03:00:18,702
Vietnam War chapter, I'm in Hanoi speaking to Viet

2713
03:00:18,822 --> 03:00:22,242
Cong generals, asking them did they supply

2714
03:00:22,282 --> 03:00:26,262
heroin to the- to the GIs which would dimin- which diminished their

2715
03:00:26,302 --> 03:00:30,192
fighting capability. That's... You can research that, and that's- that's- that's

2716
03:00:30,262 --> 03:00:34,022
also a chapter. By the way, the Vietnam War is not called the Vietnam

2717
03:00:34,102 --> 03:00:38,012
War in Vietnam. It's called the American War. And also, I was like sitting

2718
03:00:38,042 --> 03:00:42,012
with these Viet Cong generals in Hanoi just like a few weeks ago for researching

2719
03:00:42,022 --> 03:00:48,382
bring heroin?" Because there's never been evidence that it happened this way.

2720
03:00:48,442 --> 03:00:52,342
There's never been evidence that it happened this way,

2721
03:00:52,622 --> 03:00:55,682
and they just looked at me and they said, "There's no Viet Cong."

2722
03:00:55,782 --> 03:00:59,732
Like, "What are you talking about?" "You are the Viet Cong."

2723
03:00:59,782 --> 03:01:03,382
They said, "No, this is an American propaganda term.

2724
03:01:03,442 --> 03:01:07,322
We were the North Vietnamese Army. We never call ourselves the Viet Cong."

2725
03:01:07,342 --> 03:01:11,062
So the book is full of surprises, obviously. But the very early beginning

2726
03:01:11,122 --> 03:01:14,942
of Stoned Sapiens goes back to about 1.5 million years ago, when

2727
03:01:15,022 --> 03:01:19,002
Homo Erectus, who also has become kind of famous by now,

2728
03:01:19,082 --> 03:01:21,182
Homo Erectus. It's like the first human that really gets

2729
03:01:22,182 --> 03:01:24,902
human that really gets shit done, you know.

2730
03:01:24,942 --> 03:01:26,062
- Yeah, they get moving.

2731
03:01:26,102 --> 03:01:27,432
- Yeah, they move.

2732
03:01:27,442 --> 03:01:28,522
- And why were they moving?

2733
03:01:28,542 --> 03:01:32,122
- Why were they moving? I mean, then you can examine exactly where they originated,

2734
03:01:32,182 --> 03:01:36,012
which was, I mean, it's also disputed by now that it's the Great Rift Valley.

2735
03:01:36,042 --> 03:01:39,862
That only the most fossils have been found there, but that doesn't mean

2736
03:01:39,882 --> 03:01:43,782
that they originated there. Maybe they originated in the Central African

2737
03:01:43,822 --> 03:01:47,802
rainforest where fossils disintegrate, and only there in the Rift Valley

2738
03:01:47,822 --> 03:01:51,602
we still find it. But we know for sure that in the Great Rift Valley

2739
03:01:51,662 --> 03:01:55,482
we still find it. So, but we know for sure that in the Great Rift Valley

2740
03:01:55,522 --> 03:01:59,502
there was a plant called khat, which is a plant speed. So they were using that.

2741
03:01:59,542 --> 03:02:03,342
So they were using that. It's still being used now in these countries,

2742
03:02:03,402 --> 03:02:05,902
in Ethiopia, Yemen, around the Horn of Africa, khat is very normal to use.

2743
03:02:06,142 --> 03:02:10,042
Yemen, around the Horn of Africa, khat is very normal to use.

2744
03:02:10,082 --> 03:02:13,982
You chew the leaves, and it gives you like, it's like an amphetamine.

2745
03:02:14,002 --> 03:02:17,962
It's a plant amphetamine basically. So Homo Erectus,

2746
03:02:18,002 --> 03:02:21,592
there's no proof that they actually used it, but they were living in that area

2747
03:02:21,682 --> 03:02:25,612
and the plant was there, so you can write about that.

2748
03:02:25,942 --> 03:02:29,872
So it's interesting because they were able to do certain things,

2749
03:02:30,002 --> 03:02:33,122
like they shed the fur.

2750
03:02:33,142 --> 03:02:35,942
They were the first ones to suddenly be naked. And that has the effect

2751
03:02:36,022 --> 03:02:39,722
that sweat glands are produced. Homo Erectus could sweat it out

2752
03:02:40,322 --> 03:02:45,972
basically when they were very hot. Basically when they were very hot.

2753
03:02:46,442 --> 03:02:48,862
What animals couldn't do because they had the fur.

2754
03:02:49,662 --> 03:02:53,502
So an antelope can run faster than a Homo Erectus, but after 10 minutes,

2755
03:02:53,582 --> 03:02:57,302
the antelope has to stop, like what dogs do, like their tongue goes out.

2756
03:02:57,482 --> 03:03:00,672
what dogs do, like their tongue goes out.

2757
03:03:00,682 --> 03:03:04,352
And humans didn't have to do that because they were sweating, so they could

2758
03:03:04,482 --> 03:03:07,002
They developed the jogging mode basically.

2759
03:03:07,022 --> 03:03:10,772
So they were jogging. They were not sprinting to get the animal.

2760
03:03:10,822 --> 03:03:14,592
They were jogging it, and when the animal couldn't do it, had to rest,

2761
03:03:14,642 --> 03:03:18,622
then the humans would come and hunt it down. So Homo Erectus was evolutionary

2762
03:03:18,722 --> 03:03:22,382
very good. And then later one of the species coming out of Homo Erectus

2763
03:03:22,582 --> 03:03:31,178
is Homo Sapiens. At one point, there were only about 1,500

2764
03:03:31,238 --> 03:03:35,037
people left. There were not a lot of Homo sapiens. There was a

2765
03:03:35,078 --> 03:03:38,877
point in time when there were quite a few of them, and the problem

2766
03:03:38,978 --> 03:03:42,697
became inbreeding, and there was a real danger of

2767
03:03:42,758 --> 03:03:46,398
extinction. They were vulnerable, you know? They were not on top of the food chain

2768
03:03:46,438 --> 03:03:48,438
yet, so they had to develop

2769
03:03:49,277 --> 03:03:53,217
consciousness. Consciousness is what basically saved us from extinction.

2770
03:03:53,258 --> 03:03:57,158
Without human consciousness, we wouldn't be here, you know? That is what made

2771
03:03:57,258 --> 03:04:00,447
us, in the end, then superior to the other animals. So, how did this

2772
03:04:00,558 --> 03:04:04,428
happen? You can kind of trace how they moved. You can trace that

2773
03:04:04,457 --> 03:04:07,918
they went through the Central African rainforest,

2774
03:04:08,398 --> 03:04:12,387
and there's one plant there which elephants like, and

2775
03:04:12,418 --> 03:04:16,098
that's Iboga. And Iboga now is the hot thing of the

2776
03:04:16,117 --> 03:04:19,877
psychedelic renaissance. Iboga, Iboga, Iboga. But it's also the oldest

2777
03:04:19,978 --> 03:04:24,978
drug in the book, basically. They saw that elephants were eating Iboga,

2778
03:04:25,938 --> 03:04:29,918
the root and the leaves, and suddenly were like, walking backwards and were

2779
03:04:29,957 --> 03:04:33,877
behaving in an unusual way, and then people were also using this.

2780
03:04:33,978 --> 03:04:40,898
And this was going on over 100,000 years in the rainforest. So, you can, you can

2781
03:04:40,938 --> 03:04:44,717
write a story about that, you know. Was it maybe Iboga? Of course, you can't

2782
03:04:44,777 --> 03:04:49,108
prove it. You know, maybe the frontal cortex grew by itself, you know?

2783
03:04:49,117 --> 03:04:52,738
- That's a really compelling story. That's one of the great mysteries

2784
03:04:52,898 --> 03:04:56,018
of... How did the light turn on?

2785
03:04:56,078 --> 03:04:56,158
- Right.

2786
03:04:56,217 --> 03:04:59,377
- The magic of human cognition and consciousness, and the...

2787
03:04:59,777 --> 03:05:03,438
- Like Sapiens by Harari, which is a great book, he also misses that.

2788
03:05:03,457 --> 03:05:07,258
Like, when it comes to those moments, he writes like, "We

2789
03:05:07,297 --> 03:05:11,148
don't understand how the first cognitive revolution and the second

2790
03:05:11,217 --> 03:05:15,058
cognitive revolution actually happened." So, I find it interesting to

2791
03:05:15,117 --> 03:05:18,707
kind of look, could it have been drugs? Like, I

2792
03:05:18,758 --> 03:05:22,627
include, like everything he leaves out, I I- I-

2793
03:05:22,758 --> 03:05:24,068
I look at thoroughly in Stoned Sapiens.

2794
03:05:24,068 --> 03:05:30,998
- I mean, he does a good explanation of interesting consequences, you know? Our

2795
03:05:31,058 --> 03:05:35,018
ability to imagine ideas and share them, and, you know, collaborate on them,

2796
03:05:35,058 --> 03:05:38,518
and the imagination, all that kind of stuff. But the why, the

2797
03:05:38,578 --> 03:05:42,777
transitions of why did it happen, he doesn't provide, right?

2798
03:05:43,938 --> 03:05:46,938
I mean, there's some theories, but if Iboga is one of

2799
03:05:46,957 --> 03:05:50,848
them, that's a compelling one. That's a really compelling one.

2800
03:05:51,998 --> 03:05:55,777
- Yeah. I mean, I'm still researching this book and writing it. I also want to go

2801
03:05:55,957 --> 03:06:02,438
there, because they still take Iboga in Gabon, for example. I also

2802
03:06:03,818 --> 03:06:10,867
interviewed one of the leading Iboga experts at Columbia University, and for Stoned

2803
03:06:10,938 --> 03:06:14,777
Sapiens, and he described how Iboga works in the brain,

2804
03:06:14,797 --> 03:06:17,338
because that's... And he's never taken Iboga himself.

2805
03:06:17,377 --> 03:06:18,258
- Oh, interesting.

2806
03:06:18,277 --> 03:06:20,377
- He just relies on the data. He doesn't want to be

2807
03:06:21,498 --> 03:06:25,277
personally influenced. But he said he will take it at a certain point in time.

2808
03:06:25,297 --> 03:06:26,738
But right now, he's still just

2809
03:06:27,658 --> 03:06:31,498
working on data, just with patients, you know? And what he found, and

2810
03:06:31,558 --> 03:06:35,408
and also examining the brain through brain scanners, what actually happens.

2811
03:06:35,457 --> 03:06:39,197
Like classic psychedelics, like LSD or psilocybin, they

2812
03:06:39,338 --> 03:06:42,998
dock at certain points. They interact with certain receptors. It's quite

2813
03:06:43,037 --> 03:06:46,158
well-understood how they work. And he said iboga is completely

2814
03:06:46,168 --> 03:06:49,957
different. It's like... and he also showed this with his hands, because

2815
03:06:49,998 --> 03:06:53,808
he's just so mesmerized by his own findings. Like it's kind of

2816
03:06:53,818 --> 03:06:57,797
everywhere at the same time in the brain. He

2817
03:06:57,818 --> 03:07:01,688
says it's like a spa for the neurons, basically. The

2818
03:07:01,717 --> 03:07:05,498
it's... his findings show, and these are academic findings at

2819
03:07:05,537 --> 03:07:09,418
Columbia, that iboga... it's like, as if, he says,

2820
03:07:09,457 --> 03:07:13,377
he said to me, as if iboga would know our brain for a long time.

2821
03:07:13,418 --> 03:07:15,978
Like, it knows exactly. Like if you're addicted to

2822
03:07:16,037 --> 03:07:19,488
something, or if you're depressed. The depression

2823
03:07:20,717 --> 03:07:24,748
literally is a depression in the neuronal network. Depression is

2824
03:07:25,598 --> 03:07:29,547
a thought loop, for example, or, you know, a system of thought loops that

2825
03:07:29,578 --> 03:07:33,037
you're, that, "I'm not worthy, I'm not whatever, I can't do it." You

2826
03:07:33,617 --> 03:07:37,438
always go back. This is... It really kind of depresses your

2827
03:07:37,877 --> 03:07:39,617
brain in a way. And iboga

2828
03:07:40,637 --> 03:07:44,498
sees this immediately, and kind of takes the depression out and

2829
03:07:44,537 --> 03:07:51,697
and makes your brain go basically well again. So this is what he, this is what

2830
03:07:51,758 --> 03:07:55,668
his findings are. So, he says he's totally convinced this is like a...

2831
03:07:55,697 --> 03:07:59,637
He doesn't call it a plant. He calls it like a neurotechnology

2832
03:07:59,678 --> 03:08:03,377
of the 22nd century. So iboga really seems to be

2833
03:08:04,338 --> 03:08:08,238
in a different kind of category. That's why

2834
03:08:08,248 --> 03:08:13,248
I really feel that "Stoned Sapiens" must be written, because there's so much

2835
03:08:14,637 --> 03:08:22,058
that historians just shied away from. It all started when I was on the

2836
03:08:22,158 --> 03:08:26,137
island of Crete, the biggest island of Greece. Crete,

2837
03:08:26,158 --> 03:08:30,928
that's another, like, Harari moment. On Crete was the first

2838
03:08:31,797 --> 03:08:35,558
what is called high culture of Europe, the Minoan culture. You might have heard of the

2839
03:08:35,578 --> 03:08:40,898
Minoan culture. And no one can explain so far,

2840
03:08:42,158 --> 03:08:47,158
why there on Crete, suddenly in Europe, they started making

2841
03:08:48,558 --> 03:08:52,498
amazing structures and amazing art, and how did

2842
03:08:52,537 --> 03:08:56,178
it happen there that this, like, totally backwards place,

2843
03:08:56,238 --> 03:09:00,137
Crete, became... I mean, backwards as any other place, you

2844
03:09:00,158 --> 03:09:03,978
know? Why did it happen there that such intricate objects were

2845
03:09:04,018 --> 03:09:07,858
being made and that the culture was developing so

2846
03:09:07,957 --> 03:09:11,348
intensely? And I was kind of thinking about that. That's how the book started.

2847
03:09:12,377 --> 03:09:16,358
I was with my kids on vacation in Crete.

2848
03:09:16,377 --> 03:09:19,518
And if you go to, like, Knossos or Phaistos, the big

2849
03:09:20,438 --> 03:09:22,558
archeological sites, or to the museum

2850
03:09:23,478 --> 03:09:26,758
in Heraklion, you don't find an answer. Why did it happen

2851
03:09:26,838 --> 03:09:34,582
there? And then I found like an old book in an old bookshop, and it

2852
03:09:34,602 --> 03:09:40,962
described an excavation site at the sea, and that it was like maybe a

2853
03:09:41,022 --> 03:09:48,052
maritime place, or like a harbor basically. And then while I was swimming there, I

2854
03:09:48,082 --> 03:09:55,602
found on the sea floor, the remnants of a wall that was a harbor wall that was

2855
03:09:55,702 --> 03:10:00,962
out, that was breaking the waves, and then I climbed over the

2856
03:10:01,002 --> 03:10:04,842
fence because the archeological site is still fenced

2857
03:10:04,922 --> 03:10:08,551
off, like it's not explained officially what it is, and

2858
03:10:08,582 --> 03:10:12,462
the walls in there are the biggest walls of the

2859
03:10:12,482 --> 03:10:15,202
whole Bronze Era. It was actually quite a big

2860
03:10:15,242 --> 03:10:19,202
harbor. The next step is, what did they trade?

2861
03:10:19,282 --> 03:10:22,962
And they traded olive oil because Crete was the first place to produce olive

2862
03:10:23,102 --> 03:10:29,902
oil. And I also found, and this is historically documented, opium was made in

2863
03:10:29,962 --> 03:10:33,922
Crete and the poppy flower was growing there. And this was the

2864
03:10:34,002 --> 03:10:37,882
harbor. They became incredibly wealthy through olive oil

2865
03:10:37,902 --> 03:10:41,702
and opium trade through that harbor. So you could say

2866
03:10:41,782 --> 03:10:45,662
that the whole of European high culture, which we

2867
03:10:45,682 --> 03:10:49,402
goes from Minoan, goes to Athens. It all

2868
03:10:49,622 --> 03:10:53,452
started basically with, you know, they were drug dealers in a way. Or they...

2869
03:10:53,502 --> 03:10:56,872
I mean, it was the most potent medicine, 'cause it was the only medicine that

2870
03:10:59,022 --> 03:11:09,952
numbs the pain for sure. Opium works, and the Minoans developed that. So, I

2871
03:11:10,002 --> 03:11:13,922
mean, it's kind of, it's a bit similar to the Blitz experience. You know

2872
03:11:14,042 --> 03:11:17,242
the more I researched, the more I found

2873
03:11:17,282 --> 03:11:19,492
- that there's this whole component to human history...

2874
03:11:19,492 --> 03:11:23,002
...that could be a really critical component. I'm really interested about the

2875
03:11:23,042 --> 03:11:26,462
origin... There's certain leaps, like the origins of human

2876
03:11:26,522 --> 03:11:31,862
civilization, and then the origins of Homo sapiens. Those are really big leaps.

2877
03:11:32,482 --> 03:11:36,422
- I mean, there's some evidence, like, they came through the area where Iboga was,

2878
03:11:36,462 --> 03:11:41,382
but there's no academic proof. So, I guess

2879
03:11:42,382 --> 03:11:46,342
an academically trained historian couldn't really write about that.

2880
03:11:46,502 --> 03:11:51,142
But I can write about it. I can write about possibilities.

2881
03:11:51,242 --> 03:11:54,502
- Yeah, sometimes... The farther into history you

2882
03:11:54,542 --> 03:11:59,932
go, the more it's about writing the possibilities.

2883
03:12:01,062 --> 03:12:04,922
- I mean, it's also interesting, why did the Neanderthals die out?

2884
03:12:04,962 --> 03:12:08,922
And what we can compare is the cave art. And the cave art of

2885
03:12:08,962 --> 03:12:12,632
the Neanderthals is much simpler than ours.

2886
03:12:12,632 --> 03:12:15,742
If you really get into the cave art, I don't know if you've done that.

2887
03:12:15,762 --> 03:12:16,612
- Have not, no.

2888
03:12:16,612 --> 03:12:20,082
- It's quite fascinating. Picasso looked at some of the cave

2889
03:12:20,202 --> 03:12:24,182
paintings in Southern France, and he said, "We didn't learn anything

2890
03:12:24,282 --> 03:12:27,902
new." And if you study them, they're really good. But only the

2891
03:12:27,962 --> 03:12:35,602
humans are good. The Neanderthals, they were worse artists than us. And you can

2892
03:12:35,702 --> 03:12:39,642
also see, there's a very famous one that comes from Algeria

2893
03:12:40,722 --> 03:12:44,602
with a shaman, and around his body, mushrooms grow

2894
03:12:44,682 --> 03:12:48,512
out of his body, so he was a mushroom shaman. So mushrooms seem to have been,

2895
03:12:48,522 --> 03:12:53,902
part, at least in that area. And that's the 'Stoned Ape' theory,

2896
03:12:53,962 --> 03:13:01,632
that Terence McKenna did. And I think a lot of evidence kind of points to it

2897
03:13:01,742 --> 03:13:04,922
that we were able to develop our consciousness

2898
03:13:05,902 --> 03:13:09,282
in a better way than the Neanderthals who did not have a drug

2899
03:13:09,342 --> 03:13:13,172
culture. They were basically too sober for the

2900
03:13:13,282 --> 03:13:18,742
future. We assimilated them. They had no chance against our

2901
03:13:20,022 --> 03:13:23,842
impetus of boldly going where no one has gone before. They were much more

2902
03:13:23,902 --> 03:13:27,852
happy with what they had. They were not progressing all the time. Like, we have

2903
03:13:27,882 --> 03:13:31,672
the transcendental kind of moment, which

2904
03:13:31,822 --> 03:13:35,302
is, you know, the psychedelic experience. I guess you

2905
03:13:35,342 --> 03:13:40,342
could think of it without it, but to imagine Sapiens

2906
03:13:41,362 --> 03:13:44,902
makes more sense to imagine Sapiens as Stoned Sapiens, as a

2907
03:13:45,002 --> 03:13:48,922
species that was able to incorporate psychoactive components

2908
03:13:48,982 --> 03:13:52,022
into its development. It makes a lot of sense.

2909
03:13:52,292 --> 03:13:55,842
- What about one of the great, if you can think of it that way,

2910
03:13:55,882 --> 03:13:59,602
technologies that humans have developed is religion. Religion evolved

2911
03:13:59,622 --> 03:14:01,352
different kinds. Do you think there's a connection

2912
03:14:02,582 --> 03:14:06,142
between psychedelics and religion, the development of religion throughout different

2913
03:14:06,162 --> 03:14:07,762
parts of the world?

2914
03:14:07,802 --> 03:14:12,882
- Well, I think Moses is quite interesting. Moses was

2915
03:14:13,962 --> 03:14:21,782
a traumatized man that had fled Egypt where he had killed a man who had been

2916
03:14:21,822 --> 03:14:25,762
beating up a Hebrew, so Moses kind of took revenge and killed him.

2917
03:14:25,802 --> 03:14:28,802
So he was running from the law and he was

2918
03:14:30,502 --> 03:14:34,122
together with, in the Bible it says, I think 66

2919
03:14:34,822 --> 03:14:38,802
people, they were in the desert, in the Sinai, and they had been

2920
03:14:38,902 --> 03:14:42,822
fasting for days and no alcohol, so it was kind

2921
03:14:42,842 --> 03:14:49,622
of a psychedelic retreat, basically. I mean, this is being examined by Israeli

2922
03:14:49,682 --> 03:14:54,102
scholars and I think it's very interesting work. They examine in detail

2923
03:14:55,602 --> 03:14:59,442
what does the Bible say, and the Bible mentions in that passage where Moses

2924
03:14:59,522 --> 03:15:03,162
sees the burning bush and then gets the Ten Commandments. In

2925
03:15:03,222 --> 03:15:06,412
that Bible passage, there's a lot of

2926
03:15:07,522 --> 03:15:13,162
several times the acacia is mentioned. And the Egyptian acacia

2927
03:15:13,982 --> 03:15:23,742
grows right in the Sinai area and contains DMT. So there's this Israeli research

2928
03:15:23,762 --> 03:15:27,472
that Moses was actually having a trip, basically, that he was

2929
03:15:27,582 --> 03:15:31,272
seeing, he was hallucinating the burning bush,

2930
03:15:31,342 --> 03:15:35,170
was... you know, if you take LSD and you look at a bush

2931
03:15:35,350 --> 03:15:39,030
in the heat, you know, it will move, you know? It might

2932
03:15:39,110 --> 03:15:42,990
resemble, like, a burning experience. And you know, experience.

2933
03:15:43,010 --> 03:15:46,730
And he went up the mountain, which takes three hours, while the others were

2934
03:15:46,810 --> 03:15:49,790
staying down. And with the DMT type of

2935
03:15:49,830 --> 03:15:53,770
experience, it's not that everyone in the group has the same experience, you

2936
03:15:53,850 --> 03:15:57,390
know, to Ayahuasca. Sometimes, like, one guy has an incredible

2937
03:15:57,430 --> 03:16:01,140
experience, while another person might not feel that much at all.

2938
03:16:01,170 --> 03:16:05,030
And Moses felt a lot. And you do feel a lot when you, you know,

2939
03:16:05,050 --> 03:16:08,890
when you are, when you have something to work through, and he had

2940
03:16:08,950 --> 03:16:12,909
certainly something to work through, the trauma of killing a man.

2941
03:16:13,010 --> 03:16:16,870
So it's also no surprise that he receives one of the commandments, "You should

2942
03:16:16,890 --> 03:16:25,790
not kill." You know? So for him, it's like extremely, extremely important and,

2943
03:16:25,910 --> 03:16:29,830
what he receives on the mountain, that God

2944
03:16:29,890 --> 03:16:33,790
is like, there's someone speaking to me, and he understands that God

2945
03:16:33,830 --> 03:16:37,330
is not, that there's not many gods, just one God. Like, he has a

2946
03:16:37,370 --> 03:16:41,350
revelation, you know? And I think it, when I, when I

2947
03:16:41,470 --> 03:16:45,210
read, you know, these examinations by these scholars, I think it makes a lot of

2948
03:16:45,270 --> 03:16:48,890
sense to imagine that the Jewish religion comes

2949
03:16:49,030 --> 03:16:52,990
from Moses' trip. And also, if you look at the Jewish religion, they

2950
03:16:53,010 --> 03:16:56,690
are quite open to drugs. I don't know if that, you know, that could be an unconscious

2951
03:16:56,750 --> 03:17:00,710
reaction to that, to that kind of trippy beginning. Like, they

2952
03:17:00,750 --> 03:17:04,610
to get intoxicated to get closer to God. They're not as straight-laced

2953
03:17:04,650 --> 03:17:08,530
to get closer to God. They're not as straight-laced

2954
03:17:08,590 --> 03:17:12,390
as the Christians. They just allow alcohol. It's like the blood of Christ.

2955
03:17:12,570 --> 03:17:16,450
Blood of Christ. So, Stoned Sapiens is a book about religion.

2956
03:17:16,510 --> 03:17:20,290
Islam and intoxication is also a very interesting topic,

2957
03:17:20,330 --> 03:17:23,550
'cause you have the Sufis who intoxicate themselves to get into ecstasy,

2958
03:17:23,560 --> 03:17:27,490
themselves to get into ecstasy, to be closer to God.

2959
03:17:27,530 --> 03:17:31,250
And then you have the conservative Islamic scholar, Ibn Taimiyya,

2960
03:17:31,330 --> 03:17:38,990
who defended Damascus against the Mongols by combining anti-drug rhetoric,

2961
03:17:39,030 --> 03:17:42,889
like, "They're bringing drugs to us and they are not good Muslims."

2962
03:17:42,930 --> 03:17:50,290
So, drugs in religion. Sometimes drugs help religion, like, are used in religious

2963
03:17:50,350 --> 03:17:53,050
religion to, like, are used in religious contexts. But then you can also

2964
03:17:53,150 --> 03:17:56,910
contexts. But then you can also see that religions work as

2965
03:17:56,930 --> 03:18:00,030
prohibitionist movements against drugs, like the Christian church.

2966
03:18:00,070 --> 03:18:03,990
Also the Purity Law, for example, it's very famous in Germany.

2967
03:18:04,050 --> 03:18:07,940
It's called the Reinheitsgebot. Beer can only contain three things:

2968
03:18:08,030 --> 03:18:11,850
water, hops, and barley or something like that.

2969
03:18:11,890 --> 03:18:15,170
barley or something like that. That's the Purity Law.

2970
03:18:15,210 --> 03:18:17,910
And that was done by the church in the 16th century.

2971
03:18:17,950 --> 03:18:21,710
And in Germany, for a long time, this was seen as a quality control.

2972
03:18:21,810 --> 03:18:25,570
seen as like, this is like a quality control, like beer has to be pure,

2973
03:18:25,630 --> 03:18:29,570
it only has these ingredients. But it's actually a move by the

2974
03:18:29,630 --> 03:18:33,490
church to weed out all the other ingredients that had been

2975
03:18:33,530 --> 03:18:37,490
put in beer before, like nightshade plants. So beer...

2976
03:18:37,550 --> 03:18:41,430
Also, witches were brewing crazy beer you drink and you have visions

2977
03:18:41,530 --> 03:18:45,410
and you have like visions and you dance around the fire. And the church

2978
03:18:45,430 --> 03:18:49,330
didn't like this. So the church said, "This is the beer now."

2979
03:18:49,390 --> 03:18:53,310
And especially, hops was the new ingredient for the beer.

2980
03:18:53,350 --> 03:18:57,310
And so the Purity Law is the first prohibitionist law in

2981
03:18:57,370 --> 03:19:02,880
the Middle Ages in Europe. Another fascinating...

2982
03:19:02,930 --> 03:19:08,110
- Yeah. I think as society develops more and more, it seems to resist,

2983
03:19:09,290 --> 03:19:15,030
certainly psychedelics, it seems to resist drugs. I don't know what that's about.

2984
03:19:16,310 --> 03:19:22,870
- One of the very fascinating turning points that I've been able to

2985
03:19:22,930 --> 03:19:30,130
pinpoint, or at least I think this is what happened, is when do the first

2986
03:19:30,230 --> 03:19:33,990
kings come up? They weren't kings for a very long time.

2987
03:19:34,050 --> 03:19:37,690
The first king that I can identify was in the so-called Sumerian

2988
03:19:37,750 --> 03:19:41,290
high culture, was in Uruk, was Gilgamesh. And they wrote the

2989
03:19:41,410 --> 03:19:44,410
Uruk, was Gilgamesh. And they wrote the Gilgamesh epic about the great king.

2990
03:19:45,250 --> 03:19:48,910
Gilgamesh epic about, you know, the great king. But that was four or

2991
03:19:48,950 --> 03:19:52,270
5,000 years ago, something like that. But what happened in the thousands

2992
03:19:52,330 --> 03:19:56,890
But what happened in the thousands of years before, there's no source

2993
03:19:57,950 --> 03:20:01,530
source that there were rulers. It seems like

2994
03:20:01,630 --> 03:20:05,410
humans were quite good in organizing themselves without kings before these

2995
03:20:05,470 --> 03:20:09,210
first kings came. I mean, thousands of years

2996
03:20:09,650 --> 03:20:14,610
from the end of the Ice Age until the Sumerian high culture, there were no kings.

2997
03:20:14,630 --> 03:20:18,390
So people were quite able to organize their communities. There was, for

2998
03:20:18,410 --> 03:20:23,430
example, Çatal Hüyük in Eastern Turkey-

2999
03:20:23,450 --> 03:20:27,319
...that was working for like 2,000 years without any hierarchies.

3000
03:20:27,330 --> 03:20:30,790
I think that is quite interesting, and then why do suddenly the

3001
03:20:30,830 --> 03:20:33,570
hierarchies start and what makes the hierarchy

3002
03:20:33,670 --> 03:20:37,220
stronger? And again, I'm still researching this,

3003
03:20:37,290 --> 03:20:43,990
but in Sumeria, we can see that it's the beer that destroys the hierarchy-free

3004
03:20:44,090 --> 03:20:47,770
society, because they are able... I mean, beer is

3005
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:51,590
quite old. The first beer was made in Gobekli Tepe, the

3006
03:20:51,650 --> 03:20:55,250
famous first kind of structure of mankind. I also write about that, because it's very

3007
03:20:55,310 --> 03:20:56,430
interesting.

3008
03:20:56,450 --> 03:21:00,330
Small detour, what is Gobekli Tepe? No one knows. How did they make it? No

3009
03:21:00,410 --> 03:21:04,250
one knows, but they made it, but why did they make it? I think

3010
03:21:04,270 --> 03:21:08,170
they made it because they were creating a meeting place, and

3011
03:21:08,210 --> 03:21:12,070
why was that so important? There were not so many humans at the time, there were

3012
03:21:12,130 --> 03:21:15,960
like one to 4 million, those are the estimates, on the whole planet.

3013
03:21:15,960 --> 03:21:19,770
And they were usually living in small communities of like a hundred people up

3014
03:21:19,830 --> 03:21:25,870
to 500, not more. So the problem then is inbreeding. Inbreeding

3015
03:21:25,930 --> 03:21:31,790
means it's a degeneration, so it's a problem.

3016
03:21:33,190 --> 03:21:36,970
We are genetically not so diverse, actually, as humans,

3017
03:21:37,030 --> 03:21:40,470
so Gobekli Tepe people were meeting from different

3018
03:21:40,570 --> 03:21:47,050
areas, having sex with people they usually wouldn't see creating healthy children.

3019
03:21:47,060 --> 03:21:51,010
And Gobekli Tepe was working for 1,600 years, and I think it

3020
03:21:51,050 --> 03:21:54,600
was like an evolutionary kind of machine. Like,

3021
03:21:54,630 --> 03:22:00,159
without that idea, we're going to create a party place.

3022
03:22:00,159 --> 03:22:04,130
You know, it was a party, basically. They were eating very well. They found a lot of bones, but no

3023
03:22:04,170 --> 03:22:08,080
one lived there. They just came together there for parties. And then

3024
03:22:08,080 --> 03:22:11,990
after 800 years, they start making beer there, and then the

3025
03:22:12,010 --> 03:22:15,799
situation slightly changes. They found this beer,

3026
03:22:15,930 --> 03:22:19,390
these places where they made beer. You can still find the

3027
03:22:19,450 --> 03:22:22,770
chemicals and it's sure that they made beer

3028
03:22:22,810 --> 03:22:26,410
there. And then once they make beer, they create different stone

3029
03:22:26,490 --> 03:22:34,350
circles, and then somehow, it changes. And we can see clearly how it

3030
03:22:34,410 --> 03:22:38,330
changes in the Sumerian high culture when beer...

3031
03:22:38,370 --> 03:22:41,880
Beer then becomes a business. Beer is being done by

3032
03:22:41,930 --> 03:22:46,830
the priests, by the ruling class, or ruling class emerges. Like,

3033
03:22:47,810 --> 03:22:51,720
monasteries often brew beer, and that was also the case in

3034
03:22:51,830 --> 03:22:55,590
the Sumerian high culture. They

3035
03:22:55,650 --> 03:22:59,570
make beer. They labeled the beer, like the temple that

3036
03:22:59,610 --> 03:23:03,190
would make the beer, the beer would be attributed to that temple. It would be

3037
03:23:03,250 --> 03:23:07,170
sold, so that temple kind of rises in status, makes money. So that's

3038
03:23:07,210 --> 03:23:11,190
how hierarchies started up. So the hierarchy, which is

3039
03:23:11,230 --> 03:23:15,170
the big problem right now, that we have these hierarchies, that we have these kings everywhere that kind of

3040
03:23:15,270 --> 03:23:19,250
steal our money or at least make it very difficult for

3041
03:23:19,310 --> 03:23:22,670
us as humans to organize on an egalitarian

3042
03:23:22,710 --> 03:23:25,780
planetary scale, which is our only chance for

3043
03:23:25,810 --> 03:23:29,330
survival. If we, at one point, overcome the

3044
03:23:29,370 --> 03:23:33,340
hierarchies, overcome the nation-states, and create a planetary,

3045
03:23:33,370 --> 03:23:37,270
probably AI-assisted, open source AI-assisted

3046
03:23:37,289 --> 03:23:41,250
planetary society and everyone has the same political rights,

3047
03:23:41,270 --> 03:23:45,010
there's no more borders, there's a planetary minimum income,

3048
03:23:45,250 --> 03:23:49,170
so no one is starving. Everyone has at least what everyone needs, which is

3049
03:23:49,210 --> 03:23:53,170
totally possible. It's just a problem of organizing and of

3050
03:23:53,250 --> 03:23:56,770
breaking the resistance of those who don't like that, and there's a lot of

3051
03:23:56,830 --> 03:24:00,690
resistance, obviously. I mean, I'm talking about what's happening on the planet

3052
03:24:00,730 --> 03:24:03,680
in 50 years, not what's gonna happen tomorrow, but that is where we slowly

3053
03:24:03,710 --> 03:24:07,250
are moving towards. And you can see that this actually

3054
03:24:07,270 --> 03:24:10,890
comes from, you know, a time when we were able to

3055
03:24:10,970 --> 03:24:14,560
organize ourselves without kings. We don't need kings. Kings always

3056
03:24:14,590 --> 03:24:18,450
say, "If you don't have me, then someone else, some other guy

3057
03:24:18,490 --> 03:24:22,290
will come." But, you know, that's why

3058
03:24:22,430 --> 03:24:26,310
I mean, that's why I'm not... You know, if a nation-state makes

3059
03:24:26,410 --> 03:24:30,320
war against another nation-state, I'm not taking a position and saying,

3060
03:24:30,350 --> 03:24:34,210
"This country is, like, better." Basically, both nation-states are doing

3061
03:24:34,230 --> 03:24:38,030
war, and who has to suffer is us, you know? It's Stoned Sapiens, it's the

3062
03:24:38,090 --> 03:24:39,450
human species.

3063
03:24:39,530 --> 03:24:44,170
- Speaking of which, I have to ask you... So, I've done psilocybin a bunch,

3064
03:24:45,810 --> 03:24:52,390
and I've done ayahuasca, but I've never done LSD, acid,

3065
03:24:52,430 --> 03:24:57,810
and you have quite a bit. So, maybe the big general question

3066
03:24:57,850 --> 03:25:01,830
is what's LSD like? In the space of psychedelics, which funny enough,

3067
03:25:02,010 --> 03:25:04,310
we haven't really spoken a lot about psychedelics...

3068
03:25:04,330 --> 03:25:04,480
- Right

3069
03:25:04,510 --> 03:25:08,730
- ...except in the context of Stoned Sapiens. What's LSD like?

3070
03:25:09,990 --> 03:25:15,750
- Well, this is probably the third book that we want to talk about, is-is-

3071
03:25:15,770 --> 03:25:16,350
- Tripped

3072
03:25:16,430 --> 03:25:22,450
- ...Tripped, because Tripped is an examination of the history of LSD. And

3073
03:25:23,890 --> 03:25:26,950
that sounds maybe less interesting than it actually is. It's-

3074
03:25:27,770 --> 03:25:33,820
It's... I mean, I find it fascinating. I had tried LSD. It was given to me

3075
03:25:35,170 --> 03:25:43,430
by my girlfriend at the time, Anya, in Lower Manhattan on a Saturday night,

3076
03:25:43,989 --> 03:25:48,710
1993. So, I was, like, 23.

3077
03:25:48,730 --> 03:25:52,370
And she said, "Let's take LSD." And I'd never really taken any drug.

3078
03:25:52,410 --> 03:25:56,340
Like, I'd maybe smoked a bit of weed, but I didn't

3079
03:25:56,350 --> 03:25:59,580
know what a strong drug is. And she gave me this

3080
03:25:59,610 --> 03:26:03,450
paper, and I took it, and we walked around in the

3081
03:26:03,490 --> 03:26:07,350
East Village, pre-gentrified East Village. It's

3082
03:26:07,470 --> 03:26:11,440
pretty cool, actually. And it didn't work. For like

3083
03:26:11,440 --> 03:26:15,190
one hour, I felt nothing, and then I went into the toilet. I had a falafel

3084
03:26:15,210 --> 03:26:17,890
or something. I went into the toilet, and there was a

3085
03:26:17,910 --> 03:26:23,380
mirror. Like, I was peeing, and then there was this mirror. But

3086
03:26:24,250 --> 03:26:28,180
the walls had, like, lines. They were painted in lines. Suddenly,

3087
03:26:28,230 --> 03:26:32,830
these lines started to, like, vibrate, and that's... Then the trip started,

3088
03:26:33,870 --> 03:26:37,430
and it was such an empowerful that

3089
03:26:38,070 --> 03:26:43,210
I thought I would go insane. Like, it was the worst trip I've ever had.

3090
03:26:43,250 --> 03:26:43,580
- You got scared?

3091
03:26:43,580 --> 03:26:46,250
- ...it was so strong. I was totally scared. I didn't know what it was. I

3092
03:26:46,330 --> 03:26:50,170
I suddenly... I walked. I said to my girlfriend, "It's working."

3093
03:26:50,190 --> 03:26:53,290
And she said, "Yes, it's working. I feel it also."

3094
03:26:53,330 --> 03:26:57,570
And I went into No-Tell Motel, which was my favorite bar,

3095
03:26:58,370 --> 03:27:02,250
just to be in a familiar environment. It's not a good idea on your first very strong

3096
03:27:02,330 --> 03:27:03,480
LSD trip to be out-

3097
03:27:03,480 --> 03:27:06,940
...in Lower Manhattan on a Saturday night, but I also didn't know this.

3098
03:27:06,940 --> 03:27:10,890
You know? So, I was in the bar, and I saw my friend, Dora Espinoza,

3099
03:27:10,970 --> 03:27:15,470
from Peru. She was quite a small woman.

3100
03:27:16,350 --> 03:27:20,320
She was only, like, I don't know the American system, maybe 1 meter 50,

3101
03:27:20,470 --> 03:27:25,870
so she was quite short. Short is the right word. But on LSD, she was like this.

3102
03:27:25,890 --> 03:27:25,900
- Like, tiny.

3103
03:27:25,930 --> 03:27:33,082
- So I saw her down there, like... And I said, "Dora, do I look normal?

3104
03:27:33,122 --> 03:27:35,642
Because you look very small."

3105
03:27:35,662 --> 03:27:39,582
And Dora's like, "No, you look fine." I'm like, "Okay, I gotta get

3106
03:27:39,662 --> 03:27:43,462
outta here." And then we walked up to 2nd Avenue, and we saw,

3107
03:27:43,501 --> 03:27:46,521
like, a bunch of Puerto Rican kids

3108
03:27:47,902 --> 03:27:51,841
killing one of their... It was a gang. Kind of, it was more of a druggy

3109
03:27:51,882 --> 03:27:54,902
kind of... I mean, Manhattan back then was kind of dangerous in the East

3110
03:27:54,962 --> 03:27:58,702
Village. And they killed one of them on the hood of the

3111
03:27:58,761 --> 03:28:02,702
car. In front of our eyes, we saw it, and I said, "Do you see

3112
03:28:02,761 --> 03:28:06,722
this? Thank you, my God." And then they resurrected him,

3113
03:28:06,742 --> 03:28:10,681
like, they gave him mouth-to-mouth, and the guy was fine again.

3114
03:28:10,702 --> 03:28:14,612
And we walked past, and we were not sure anymore what we were seeing.

3115
03:28:14,612 --> 03:28:17,942
And this was a very strong hallucination. And then we saw a

3116
03:28:18,042 --> 03:28:25,302
full-blown racial riot on 2nd Avenue. People were smashing in taxi

3117
03:28:25,462 --> 03:28:31,042
windows, pulling the drivers out. It was like a- A GTA.

3118
03:28:31,242 --> 03:28:32,042
- Grand Theft Auto? Yeah.

3119
03:28:32,062 --> 03:28:34,322
- Right, it was like that. And...

3120
03:28:34,332 --> 03:28:36,021
- So most of this is basically hallucinating.

3121
03:28:36,141 --> 03:28:37,802
- I think so, yeah. And I have taken-

3122
03:28:37,812 --> 03:28:38,732
- But it felt real.

3123
03:28:38,782 --> 03:28:42,722
- It felt totally real. And so I was happy when this trip

3124
03:28:42,761 --> 03:28:46,591
was over, because I thought I had gone insane, basically.

3125
03:28:46,622 --> 03:28:50,562
I thought there was a switch in my brain that had been, like, switched.

3126
03:28:51,242 --> 03:28:55,132
Something chemical. I have now a chemical imbalance in my brain, I'm gonna be crazy for the

3127
03:28:55,162 --> 03:28:59,062
rest of my life. I thought that. But after, like, 10 hours,

3128
03:28:59,101 --> 03:29:03,341
it suddenly got, you know, the effects wore off, and I became normal again.

3129
03:29:04,642 --> 03:29:08,382
And I thought that was quite fascinating. So in hindsight, I thought it was a great

3130
03:29:08,421 --> 03:29:14,942
experience, even though it was quite scary. But it also had moments of incredible

3131
03:29:16,362 --> 03:29:20,202
perceptions, like I could see that the atoms are not, you know,

3132
03:29:20,362 --> 03:29:24,302
rigid. Obviously everything's moving in our universe. Everything.

3133
03:29:24,562 --> 03:29:28,222
There's nothing fixed, you know? So I could see that.

3134
03:29:28,482 --> 03:29:32,122
I could see that everything was basically alive, and that

3135
03:29:32,181 --> 03:29:36,062
my previous perceptions of how the world is

3136
03:29:36,122 --> 03:29:40,101
is just my conditioned perception, and that the world was very

3137
03:29:40,162 --> 03:29:44,292
different, and, you know, just how you look at it, it looks different, and...

3138
03:29:44,322 --> 03:29:45,582
- So it was freeing in a way?

3139
03:29:45,622 --> 03:29:49,582
- Yeah, totally freeing. Also, it was much stronger than all the LSD I've taken

3140
03:29:49,742 --> 03:29:53,642
since. And I've taken high dosages, so I'm not even sure if

3141
03:29:53,681 --> 03:29:56,692
that was LSD. There are also other compounds

3142
03:29:56,702 --> 03:29:56,712
- Okay

3143
03:29:56,712 --> 03:30:00,001
- that are quite rare, like DOM or whatever. Maybe it was something

3144
03:30:00,062 --> 03:30:03,662
else. But then I also spoke to LSD

3145
03:30:03,782 --> 03:30:07,582
experts by now, also for the book Tripped. And it can

3146
03:30:07,642 --> 03:30:11,632
happen that your first trip is much stronger than all the other trips,

3147
03:30:11,681 --> 03:30:15,371
because your brain kind of reacts very strongly to

3148
03:30:15,421 --> 03:30:19,162
it. Because what happens in the brain is basically that the default mode network

3149
03:30:19,181 --> 03:30:22,942
receives less energy, and other parts of the brain, they communicate better.

3150
03:30:23,001 --> 03:30:26,902
So if this happens for the first time, your brain maybe is totally surprised

3151
03:30:26,962 --> 03:30:30,841
by this firework that's going on, and then creates hallucinations,

3152
03:30:30,862 --> 03:30:34,761
so it can somehow make sense of it. There's a lot of things firing, and then so you see

3153
03:30:34,782 --> 03:30:38,642
things that maybe are not there. But that's not usual on an LSD trip. You don't

3154
03:30:38,702 --> 03:30:41,942
have such hallucinations. Like, you don't

3155
03:30:42,001 --> 03:30:47,042
have... I've never had such hallucinations afterwards again, you know?

3156
03:30:47,122 --> 03:30:50,421
- What's the usual experience on LSD?

3157
03:30:50,662 --> 03:30:54,601
- It really depends on the dosage. If you microdose, it's just like drinking

3158
03:30:54,622 --> 03:30:58,222
an espresso that lasts maybe for two, three hours in a very pleasant

3159
03:30:58,302 --> 03:31:00,542
way, so you're just slightly buzzed.

3160
03:31:01,782 --> 03:31:03,662
- Is it visual artifacts, like-

3161
03:31:03,722 --> 03:31:03,942
- No

3162
03:31:04,362 --> 03:31:05,562
- ... color?

3163
03:31:05,802 --> 03:31:09,582
- Then you would take, like, more. Maybe if you take 50 micrograms, the

3164
03:31:09,622 --> 03:31:13,482
colors become more intense. But if you take a microdose of 10 micrograms, nothing

3165
03:31:13,521 --> 03:31:17,162
happens. The trip starts with about 100 micrograms. And then you could

3166
03:31:17,341 --> 03:31:21,242
see maybe it would be... Like, I took,

3167
03:31:21,322 --> 03:31:25,261
uh, I took a swimming trip in Thailand in January, and I

3168
03:31:25,302 --> 03:31:27,572
took about 200 micrograms, which is quite a lot.

3169
03:31:28,382 --> 03:31:32,362
I just, because it was so beautiful on this island, and it was kind of, "Will it be more

3170
03:31:32,442 --> 03:31:36,082
beautiful if I'm on LSD now?" And of course, every LSD trip also

3171
03:31:38,242 --> 03:31:42,162
tells you about your life, like, some things you didn't understand. Suddenly you

3172
03:31:42,261 --> 03:31:46,091
see, like, "Oh, it's like this." It's very good for, you

3173
03:31:46,142 --> 03:31:49,811
know, reflecting on your life. But it's also a lot of fun. So I swam for,

3174
03:31:49,862 --> 03:31:53,662
like, three hours through the ocean, which is something you usually

3175
03:31:53,681 --> 03:31:57,562
don't do, you know? I like swimming, but after, like, 10 minutes or

3176
03:31:57,702 --> 03:32:01,521
20 minutes, I go out. But I was swimming and swimming and... So-

3177
03:32:02,222 --> 03:32:05,942
- Yeah, for me on the psilocybin and ayahuasca, there's a

3178
03:32:06,882 --> 03:32:11,402
intensification of beauty of the world around you.

3179
03:32:11,421 --> 03:32:15,402
Whether that's nature, or whether that's people, or whether that's your own memories

3180
03:32:15,462 --> 03:32:22,501
of your past, or maybe your imagination manifesting itself in different kinds of

3181
03:32:22,521 --> 03:32:26,382
visuals. You know, on ayahuasca, I saw dragons of

3182
03:32:26,421 --> 03:32:29,742
different kinds, and they were just really beautiful. Um,

3183
03:32:30,921 --> 03:32:34,662
and maybe I've never taken, like, a heroic dose of psilocybin,

3184
03:32:34,962 --> 03:32:38,862
but it was always, everything was just always so beautiful, and I was just grateful

3185
03:32:38,902 --> 03:32:43,442
to be alive and grateful to be in this world and get to appreciate it in this most intense way.

3186
03:32:44,582 --> 03:32:48,122
There's something about, like you said, you could see the individual

3187
03:32:48,202 --> 03:32:52,042
atoms. Like, there are certain ways to deconstruct,

3188
03:32:52,101 --> 03:32:58,792
or maybe to visualize or reinterpret, revisualize the world, that makes you like,

3189
03:32:58,841 --> 03:33:02,601
appreciate, "Holy shit, this is really, this is

3190
03:33:02,662 --> 03:33:06,542
really awesome. This is really special." And that can

3191
03:33:06,582 --> 03:33:09,261
only be done through the process of,

3192
03:33:10,862 --> 03:33:14,101
showing you a different version of it a little bit.

3193
03:33:15,322 --> 03:33:19,042
- I mean, when the Swiss pharmaceutical company Sandoz

3194
03:33:19,101 --> 03:33:23,261
developed LSD in 1943, they were having to

3195
03:33:25,261 --> 03:33:28,532
solve the big question, "What is it good for?"

3196
03:33:28,601 --> 03:33:34,454
Albert Hofmann, the chemist, he found it basically involuntarily. And he

3197
03:33:34,494 --> 03:33:38,344
reported to the CEO, "I had very strong reactions, basically, in the

3198
03:33:38,354 --> 03:33:42,314
brain." So they set up an intoxication room.

3199
03:33:42,454 --> 03:33:46,224
I found the documents about this intoxication room in the Novartis archive

3200
03:33:46,494 --> 03:33:50,454
when I researched Tripped because Novartis bought

3201
03:33:50,514 --> 03:33:54,414
Sandoz in the '90s. So all the LSD stuff is in the Novartis

3202
03:33:54,474 --> 03:33:58,394
archive. And this intoxication room,

3203
03:33:59,414 --> 03:34:03,334
I always think is kind of interesting to imagine. This was 1943; there's a

3204
03:34:03,434 --> 03:34:07,374
World War going on everywhere in Europe, except in Switzerland, which is a

3205
03:34:07,434 --> 03:34:10,684
neutral country. But Basel, where the LSD was

3206
03:34:10,714 --> 03:34:15,034
found, is like a stone's throw from the German border, so you actually hear

3207
03:34:15,834 --> 03:34:19,714
the war going on. And so they created a nice room within

3208
03:34:19,754 --> 03:34:23,404
the company, and then all the employees voluntarily could go and take

3209
03:34:23,554 --> 03:34:27,534
LSD. So they were the first people to take LSD, and they had no

3210
03:34:27,654 --> 03:34:31,554
idea that there was, at one point, MKUltra. You know,

3211
03:34:31,574 --> 03:34:35,194
they were just trying out something that one of their

3212
03:34:35,334 --> 03:34:39,054
guys had developed. And I read through all these reports, and they all

3213
03:34:39,534 --> 03:34:43,454
had a great experience, like sitting in a nice chair. And they

3214
03:34:43,464 --> 03:34:46,734
looked outside the window, and they were reporting stuff

3215
03:34:46,814 --> 03:34:50,644
like, "I just had to laugh the whole time. I felt so good. I

3216
03:34:50,674 --> 03:34:53,714
realized about my life." Or

3217
03:34:54,534 --> 03:34:58,314
it kind of created in them the feeling like a heightened

3218
03:34:58,374 --> 03:35:02,294
sense of sensitivity and a feeling that this is the

3219
03:35:02,434 --> 03:35:05,834
life, this is how life should feel, kind of. So the

3220
03:35:05,894 --> 03:35:09,574
CEO, Arthur Stoll, he was really trying to figure out what he could

3221
03:35:09,734 --> 03:35:13,274
market it for, because he thought maybe this is a game changer in mental

3222
03:35:13,344 --> 03:35:17,214
health. Because this was before antidepressants, before

3223
03:35:17,274 --> 03:35:20,834
antipsychotics, and it was in the middle of World War

3224
03:35:20,874 --> 03:35:24,434
II, which had created already millions of traumatized

3225
03:35:24,554 --> 03:35:29,154
people. "How do you treat these people?" So they thought LSD could be

3226
03:35:30,314 --> 03:35:35,814
really a big, big, big thing. And I mean, I came...

3227
03:35:37,154 --> 03:35:41,093
I just told you when I first took LSD, and I somehow was interested

3228
03:35:41,134 --> 03:35:45,074
in LSD, but I never thought I would write a book about it. I just used it once in a while

3229
03:35:45,414 --> 03:35:49,054
when I wanted to understand something about my life or just enjoy a day in the

3230
03:35:49,114 --> 03:35:55,894
ocean. But I read a study that microdoses of LSD, at one point, help against

3231
03:35:55,934 --> 03:35:59,754
Alzheimer's, and my mother has Alzheimer's. So I discussed this with

3232
03:35:59,794 --> 03:36:03,764
my father who takes care of my mother, and this was an academic study.

3233
03:36:03,774 --> 03:36:07,694
I discussed this also with a leading Alzheimer's expert that I

3234
03:36:07,734 --> 03:36:11,714
interviewed for Tripped, and he's like, "Wow, this is amazing." Because LSD

3235
03:36:11,754 --> 03:36:17,514
interacts with the very same receptors, the 5-HT2A

3236
03:36:17,854 --> 03:36:21,754
receptors in the brain, that LSD interacts

3237
03:36:21,794 --> 03:36:26,634
with those receptors and Alzheimer destroys those receptors. So

3238
03:36:27,614 --> 03:36:30,834
LSD basically does the opposite that Alzheimer does. And

3239
03:36:30,894 --> 03:36:34,674
I discussed this with my father and he said, "So why can't I

3240
03:36:34,734 --> 03:36:38,514
buy LSD in the pharmacy if it's so good?" You know? He was a

3241
03:36:38,654 --> 03:36:42,614
judge before. He actually put people in prison for drugs. So he

3242
03:36:42,654 --> 03:36:46,594
said, "You better bring me the story." So I did a kind of a research

3243
03:36:46,674 --> 03:36:50,614
loop. This is the book Tripped. Then I came back to him in the end with the

3244
03:36:50,674 --> 03:36:55,934
true story of why LSD has been made illegal, and that is quite fascinating

3245
03:36:55,994 --> 03:37:02,274
because the Swiss CEO, Stoll, he had learned biochemistry. This is

3246
03:37:02,314 --> 03:37:06,074
very nerdy, but I think it's quite interesting. He had learned biochemistry

3247
03:37:06,674 --> 03:37:13,174
from the Jewish German god of biochemistry, Willstätter. Richard Willstätter was

3248
03:37:13,474 --> 03:37:17,134
Nobel Prize winner for chemistry, and his work was

3249
03:37:17,954 --> 03:37:24,874
he would extract the potent alkaloids from so-called poisonous plants and make, you

3250
03:37:24,914 --> 03:37:28,854
know, poison. Paracelsus taught us it's

3251
03:37:28,864 --> 03:37:32,674
the dosage that makes the poison, you know? If you take too much of a

3252
03:37:32,954 --> 03:37:36,694
potent alkaloid, maybe it's a poison, but if you extract

3253
03:37:36,774 --> 03:37:40,754
a potent alkaloid, maybe you could turn it into a medicine. So Stoll

3254
03:37:40,794 --> 03:37:44,194
learned this from Willstätter, and there was another guy that was learning from

3255
03:37:44,254 --> 03:37:48,114
Willstätter, Richard Kuhn. So it was Kuhn and Stoll. Those were

3256
03:37:48,154 --> 03:37:52,043
the two students of Willstätter, and they,

3257
03:37:52,094 --> 03:37:55,624
Stoll left and became the CEO of Sandoz and developed

3258
03:37:55,794 --> 03:37:59,774
the pharmaceutical branch of Sandoz. And Kuhn became Hitler's

3259
03:37:59,834 --> 03:38:03,794
leading biochemist and was responsible in finding a truth

3260
03:38:03,894 --> 03:38:10,874
drug and also developing nerve gas. But the two guys, Kuhn and Stoll, stayed

3261
03:38:11,234 --> 03:38:15,084
friends also when the Nazis took power. I researched

3262
03:38:15,114 --> 03:38:18,934
the papers of Stoll in the archive, and in the '20s, he would

3263
03:38:18,994 --> 03:38:22,874
communicate all the ergot research. LSD is an ergot product.

3264
03:38:22,934 --> 03:38:26,854
Ergot is a fungus that grows on rye. He would communicate all this with

3265
03:38:26,874 --> 03:38:30,054
Kuhn, and Kuhn would come to the Sandoz lab, and they did experiments

3266
03:38:30,094 --> 03:38:34,014
together. And then in '43, Kuhn was, you know, a hardcore

3267
03:38:34,074 --> 03:38:37,854
Nazi scientist, and especially looking for the truth

3268
03:38:37,934 --> 03:38:41,534
drug at the time. I was looking through the archive, I wanted to

3269
03:38:41,614 --> 03:38:51,654
find the connection that Stoll also sent LSD to Kuhn, because

3270
03:38:51,734 --> 03:38:55,674
when I was researching for Blitzed in Dachau, I had found that the SS had done

3271
03:38:56,334 --> 03:38:59,454
in the concentration camp of Dachau, experiments with

3272
03:38:59,614 --> 03:39:03,404
mescaline and another hallucinogenic substance which was not

3273
03:39:03,474 --> 03:39:07,134
named. And mescaline has the problem... The truth drug

3274
03:39:07,314 --> 03:39:11,204
idea is I give you something without you noticing it,

3275
03:39:12,034 --> 03:39:15,834
like something that doesn't smell or taste like anything. Then after half an hour,

3276
03:39:15,894 --> 03:39:19,714
I know that something's working in your brain, and you become insecure

3277
03:39:19,774 --> 03:39:23,334
because suddenly something's working in your brain. I can play with that

3278
03:39:23,394 --> 03:39:27,354
situation, and therefore extract all the secrets from you because it's a power.

3279
03:39:27,394 --> 03:39:31,004
I'm suddenly above you because I know something about you that you don't

3280
03:39:31,014 --> 03:39:34,774
know. That was the idea. The problem with mescaline was it has a

3281
03:39:34,794 --> 03:39:38,674
bitter taste, and it's hard to make. And

3282
03:39:38,774 --> 03:39:41,894
LSD is very easy to make. Not very easy, but it's quite

3283
03:39:41,974 --> 03:39:48,724
easy. And LSD is odorless and tasteless. So I was trying to... I somehow had

3284
03:39:48,774 --> 03:39:52,564
the notion that LSD has a Nazi past, you know, which is

3285
03:39:52,594 --> 03:39:56,434
something that no one ever thinks about. LSD is like the hippie drug, right? It's a drug of the

3286
03:39:56,454 --> 03:40:02,754
peace people. But I wanted to see all the papers of Stoll, the CEO. And the

3287
03:40:02,894 --> 03:40:06,734
archivist, he already knew, like he was the Swiss archivist. This is not a

3288
03:40:06,774 --> 03:40:10,674
public archive. In a public archive, you basically, like the National Archives of the

3289
03:40:10,714 --> 03:40:13,964
United States, you see what's there, you have the right to see

3290
03:40:13,994 --> 03:40:17,714
it, freedom of information. But a company archive, like Novartis

3291
03:40:17,774 --> 03:40:21,684
archive, the archivist can just say, "No," you know, "I can't

3292
03:40:21,714 --> 03:40:25,534
find this right..." You know, you're basically at his

3293
03:40:25,614 --> 03:40:29,514
mercy. So I bribed him with LSD because he didn't want

3294
03:40:29,534 --> 03:40:33,474
to show me the Stoll papers. And I said to him, just to

3295
03:40:33,554 --> 03:40:36,974
distract him, "Have you ever seen LSD?" And he's

3296
03:40:37,014 --> 03:40:40,954
like, "No. Why? How would I see it?" And

3297
03:40:40,994 --> 03:40:44,954
I said, "Well, I have some here." And I had some, I just had gotten it

3298
03:40:44,994 --> 03:40:45,524
from a friend.

3299
03:40:45,524 --> 03:40:47,964
- What does LSD look like? Tabs or...

3300
03:40:47,974 --> 03:40:51,574
- Yeah, a tab. I had a paper. And the funny thing

3301
03:40:51,714 --> 03:40:54,264
about... Yeah, these are different designs, you know.

3302
03:40:54,294 --> 03:40:57,204
- Oh, and you can put it on your tongue? Is that how people usually take it?

3303
03:40:57,214 --> 03:41:01,154
- Right. Yeah. You take it like that. And the one I had was

3304
03:41:01,194 --> 03:41:05,474
given to me by a Swiss friend and it had... Like here you see certain prints on

3305
03:41:05,494 --> 03:41:06,154
- Oh, yeah.

3306
03:41:06,214 --> 03:41:09,734
- And it had the print of the old logo of

3307
03:41:09,814 --> 03:41:13,674
Sandoz from the '40s. So the guys who make this illegal LSD

3308
03:41:13,714 --> 03:41:17,614
in Basel, in some kind of lab, they know where it comes from. So they made

3309
03:41:17,694 --> 03:41:21,624
like a joke to make the old logo of Sandoz. I showed this to the archivist, and he said, "This

3310
03:41:21,714 --> 03:41:25,644
has the old logo of our company." I said, "Well, it was made by your company." He said, "I

3311
03:41:25,694 --> 03:41:29,634
know this, but it's not... This is very interesting, actually." And

3312
03:41:29,674 --> 03:41:33,334
I said, "I'm going to gift you one of these

3313
03:41:33,394 --> 03:41:37,034
trips now." And he said, "Wow, you really, you would do this?" And I said, "You can

3314
03:41:37,094 --> 03:41:40,484
archive it." And he's like, "Ha-ha-ha." And then he actually took one, he was...

3315
03:41:40,514 --> 03:41:42,054
And then the ice broke.

3316
03:41:42,094 --> 03:41:42,714
- That's great.

3317
03:41:42,734 --> 03:41:46,054
- And then he said, "Okay, I'm going to show you now the correspondence of Stoll, our CEO.

3318
03:41:46,094 --> 03:41:49,994
It's no problem." And he just went to the next room and he looked for like 10 minutes, and then

3319
03:41:50,014 --> 03:41:51,194
he brought me these boxes.

3320
03:41:52,054 --> 03:41:55,794
And then I actually saw the correspondence between Stoll and Kuhn, between the Swiss

3321
03:41:55,814 --> 03:41:59,474
CEO and the German Nazi scientist, what they were

3322
03:41:59,534 --> 03:42:07,163
talking about. And then I found a smoking gun, October 1943. Kuhn acknowledges that

3323
03:42:07,174 --> 03:42:14,714
he receives half a gram of ergotamine, which is the precursor drug to LSD. And so

3324
03:42:14,754 --> 03:42:18,734
it's highly likely that the Nazis used LSD

3325
03:42:18,774 --> 03:42:22,774
together with mescaline in Dachau. And when the Americans

3326
03:42:24,014 --> 03:42:27,494
liberated the Dachau camp, they had a special unit called

3327
03:42:27,614 --> 03:42:31,474
Alsos with them. And Alsos' job was to find German scientists

3328
03:42:32,374 --> 03:42:36,294
and interview them, get their knowledge for the nuclear program mostly, but

3329
03:42:36,414 --> 03:42:40,314
also for biochemical weapons. And one of the first persons they

3330
03:42:40,414 --> 03:42:44,364
interrogated was Richard Kuhn, and Richard Kuhn immediately collaborated because he didn't

3331
03:42:44,394 --> 03:42:48,174
want to go to the Nuremberg trial. He wanted to continue his career

3332
03:42:48,254 --> 03:42:52,114
actually. He was an opportunist, so I guess his Nazi convictions were not so strong

3333
03:42:52,214 --> 03:42:56,064
after all, because he also liked the Americans. So he told the Americans

3334
03:42:56,094 --> 03:43:03,754
immediately about LSD. And the next day, a very high general flew from the States to

3335
03:43:03,794 --> 03:43:07,454
Frankfurt, went to Heidelberg, spoke to Kuhn again. Then, he took

3336
03:43:07,574 --> 03:43:11,474
off his uniform and went in civil clothing to

3337
03:43:11,494 --> 03:43:14,574
Basel, because Switzerland is neutral, and received the first

3338
03:43:14,654 --> 03:43:18,454
LSD from Stoll's son. So, the American

3339
03:43:18,514 --> 03:43:22,174
general had LSD. This was in '45 in the summer. Then the

3340
03:43:22,234 --> 03:43:25,614
American military started to examine

3341
03:43:25,714 --> 03:43:29,694
LSD. Could LSD be the truth drug? Because if the Nazis think

3342
03:43:29,734 --> 03:43:33,354
so, maybe it's true, because the Nazis were cutting-edge

3343
03:43:33,454 --> 03:43:35,414
scientists as evil as they were.

3344
03:43:35,454 --> 03:43:40,674
- In Dachau, this was presumably used for the different experimentation that was done.

3345
03:43:40,714 --> 03:43:46,534
- Well, I read one report from a guy who was an inmate, and he received it in

3346
03:43:46,594 --> 03:43:50,554
coffee, and he had a full-blown psychedelic

3347
03:43:50,614 --> 03:43:54,934
trip. And he had this SS guy who was asking him questions, and

3348
03:43:55,753 --> 03:43:58,854
the guy had such a great trip.

3349
03:43:58,914 --> 03:44:02,894
I would always imagine you'd have a terrible trip in a concentration camp, but he was seeing fractals

3350
03:44:02,914 --> 03:44:06,864
and colors, and he could see that there was something bigger than these Nazis, and

3351
03:44:06,874 --> 03:44:10,534
there was something bigger than the concentration camp. And he only said it was so

3352
03:44:10,594 --> 03:44:14,534
horrible when the trip ended and he became sober again and was just an

3353
03:44:14,594 --> 03:44:16,194
inmate again in the concentration camp.

3354
03:44:16,234 --> 03:44:19,994
- I mean, one of the things you get from books like Man's Search for Meaning

3355
03:44:20,434 --> 03:44:23,734
by Viktor Frankl is that in the concentration camp actually, the

3356
03:44:23,814 --> 03:44:28,604
slightest good things are so rich of...

3357
03:44:28,734 --> 03:44:29,034
- Right

3358
03:44:29,044 --> 03:44:32,714
- ...feeling. You just get... So, I would

3359
03:44:32,754 --> 03:44:36,534
actually expect to have incredible trips there because you're

3360
03:44:36,594 --> 03:44:40,554
just grateful for anything positive, anything positive.

3361
03:44:40,614 --> 03:44:42,054
- Yeah, I didn't think about that.

3362
03:44:42,064 --> 03:44:43,054
- It becomes intensified.

3363
03:44:43,074 --> 03:44:43,084
- Makes sense.

3364
03:44:43,094 --> 03:44:47,414
- But from the perspective of the Nazis, they're trying to develop the truth drug.

3365
03:44:47,474 --> 03:44:53,914
- They miserably failed because LSD... ...Is not the truth drug. LSD leads you

3366
03:44:54,054 --> 03:44:58,014
closer to your own truth, because when suddenly the default mode

3367
03:44:58,054 --> 03:45:01,694
network receives less energy and other parts of the brain think more and the brain

3368
03:45:01,734 --> 03:45:05,624
becomes neuroplastic, you know, the neuroplasticity of the brain is

3369
03:45:05,734 --> 03:45:09,714
enhanced and is stimulated, you might understand something about your

3370
03:45:09,724 --> 03:45:13,614
life. You might not, you know. LSD doesn't necessarily turn you into a more

3371
03:45:13,634 --> 03:45:17,264
knowledgeable person. You could also focus that on your

3372
03:45:17,314 --> 03:45:21,034
Orthodox belief system. But many people realize different things, have

3373
03:45:21,074 --> 03:45:27,654
different ideas. So it doesn't work as this conditioning drug. But also the

3374
03:45:27,754 --> 03:45:31,414
CIA then kind of took over the LSD

3375
03:45:31,454 --> 03:45:35,414
experiments that the US military took over from the SS. So

3376
03:45:35,534 --> 03:45:39,474
now it's in CIA hands. In 1947, Central Intelligence Agency

3377
03:45:39,494 --> 03:45:43,062
is founded, because America didn't have a Central

3378
03:45:43,102 --> 03:45:46,552
Intelligence Agency before. They had, like, the military agencies like

3379
03:45:46,602 --> 03:45:54,142
OSS. Now they have the CIA, and the CIA makes Dulles, the first director, he says,

3380
03:45:55,022 --> 03:45:59,002
"The brain warfare is going on now between the Soviet Union and us. This is

3381
03:45:59,082 --> 03:46:03,052
Cold War. We have to..." you know, maybe they are using

3382
03:46:03,182 --> 03:46:06,622
something against us. We have to be really on our, you know, we have to be

3383
03:46:06,662 --> 03:46:10,122
prepared, you know, for the brain warfare, 'cause Communism is a

3384
03:46:10,162 --> 03:46:14,082
propagandistic system. So they were always, like, either really

3385
03:46:14,142 --> 03:46:18,122
afraid or just pretending to be afraid the Soviet Union would, you know, develop the

3386
03:46:18,162 --> 03:46:21,062
truth drug quicker than them. So the LSD

3387
03:46:21,962 --> 03:46:25,942
truth drug program which was labeled MKULTRA, the

3388
03:46:26,022 --> 03:46:30,012
infamous MKULTRA is, is a mind control program. I mean, it is, and LSD

3389
03:46:30,182 --> 03:46:32,222
played a big part in it.

3390
03:46:32,232 --> 03:46:35,142
- It's a deeply illegal one.

3391
03:46:35,342 --> 03:46:39,782
- It certainly... I mean, it was never approved by Congress or anything that.

3392
03:46:39,792 --> 03:46:42,902
- It's probably deeply unethical, maybe one of the more

3393
03:46:43,402 --> 03:46:48,662
un-American, unethical things done in, in recent times.

3394
03:46:48,722 --> 03:46:52,302
- It's certainly unethical. It continues the Nazi human experiments.

3395
03:46:52,322 --> 03:46:52,622
- Right.

3396
03:46:52,662 --> 03:46:53,862
- That's what the CIA did.

3397
03:46:53,882 --> 03:46:59,462
- It's, it's continuing one of the worst aspects of what the Nazis were doing.

3398
03:46:59,522 --> 03:47:04,122
Defeated the Nazis and carried the flag forward. It's, it's just dark.

3399
03:47:04,142 --> 03:47:08,022
- And this is basically the reason why LSD at one point became illegal,

3400
03:47:08,062 --> 03:47:11,962
because it did not get the chance... Stoll still wanted to put it

3401
03:47:12,002 --> 03:47:15,902
on the market, but Sidney Gottlieb, the head

3402
03:47:15,962 --> 03:47:21,622
of MKULTRA, he really didn't want LSD to be on the market. He wanted, not because

3403
03:47:22,542 --> 03:47:23,102
he thought it's

3404
03:47:24,202 --> 03:47:28,142
not good or dangerous for anybody, he just wanted to control LSD. He wanted

3405
03:47:28,462 --> 03:47:34,942
LSD to be his so he could use it for MKULTRA, for experiments. He couldn't really

3406
03:47:35,142 --> 03:47:38,922
stop. There was also legit LSD research always going on until it

3407
03:47:38,962 --> 03:47:42,822
was prohibited in 1966. There was legit LSD research

3408
03:47:42,882 --> 03:47:46,502
done in universities which came to all kinds of conclusions.

3409
03:47:46,542 --> 03:47:54,482
But the decisive thing was a visit by Gottlieb in the office of Stoll in

3410
03:47:54,562 --> 03:47:58,482
Basel where he basically says to Stoll, he comes with a suitcase

3411
03:47:58,522 --> 03:48:02,452
with 240,000 US dollars to buy the world's

3412
03:48:02,462 --> 03:48:08,302
supply of LSD, because he has the information from the American

3413
03:48:09,102 --> 03:48:12,722
ambassador. Like he has, he said like, "I

3414
03:48:12,762 --> 03:48:16,712
think, we think by now Sandoz has produced, like, 400 kilograms of LSD."

3415
03:48:16,742 --> 03:48:20,472
So that was the price for this 400. And Stoll said, "No, actually we have produced only

3416
03:48:20,602 --> 03:48:24,452
400 grams." And "But I'll sell everything to you, of course."

3417
03:48:24,522 --> 03:48:28,442
I mean, because the pressure that he received from the CIA was,

3418
03:48:28,482 --> 03:48:35,662
'cause the CIA and the FDA, they're quite friendly organizations.

3419
03:48:35,742 --> 03:48:39,602
So the CIA has a certain influence on the FDA, at least back then, you

3420
03:48:39,642 --> 03:48:43,162
know? So the pressure was if you want to put your

3421
03:48:43,182 --> 03:48:46,722
medicines on the market, which is of course the biggest market in the world,

3422
03:48:46,782 --> 03:48:50,552
and Sandoz, you know, I'm sure you want to thrive as a pharmaceutical

3423
03:48:50,642 --> 03:48:54,422
company, then LSD is not going to be one of these products. And Stoll

3424
03:48:55,262 --> 03:49:03,082
basically betrayed LSD. So he said okay, and LSD was only distributed as a research

3425
03:49:03,122 --> 03:49:06,942
drug. It was never sold by the company. So researchers could actually

3426
03:49:07,022 --> 03:49:10,902
write to Sandoz, "I'm doing this and this test,

3427
03:49:10,922 --> 03:49:14,242
and I'm a neuroscientist, I need LSD." Then they would receive

3428
03:49:14,302 --> 03:49:18,162
it. But mostly what happened to the

3429
03:49:18,242 --> 03:49:21,262
LSD was it went into the CIA's hands, and then it was used in

3430
03:49:21,342 --> 03:49:25,202
MKULTRA. But then it spilled out, obviously, because one of the

3431
03:49:25,242 --> 03:49:29,142
guinea pigs was Ken Kesey. He received 75 US dollars

3432
03:49:29,162 --> 03:49:32,782
for taking LSD for the CIA, and he was working in Menlo

3433
03:49:32,922 --> 03:49:36,822
Park in a psychiatric ward. And on LSD, he basically had the idea to write

3434
03:49:36,882 --> 03:49:40,842
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He understood that these people maybe

3435
03:49:40,882 --> 03:49:44,202
are not crazy. It's just a different way of seeing. That's like an LSD

3436
03:49:44,282 --> 03:49:48,112
revelation. These are not bad, crazy people. They just see the world

3437
03:49:48,142 --> 03:49:52,121
differently. Because that neuroplasticity that

3438
03:49:52,192 --> 03:49:56,102
kind of leads you away from one way of thinking. You realize

3439
03:49:56,122 --> 03:49:59,762
that there are different ways. So, I would say, LSD

3440
03:49:59,862 --> 03:50:06,182
the tendency of LSD is more to increase...

3441
03:50:06,222 --> 03:50:07,231
- Empathy? That kind of thing?

3442
03:50:07,231 --> 03:50:10,462
- ...empathy, diversity, all these kind of things.

3443
03:50:10,472 --> 03:50:14,442
- So because you mentioned the effect of LSD on you as a

3444
03:50:14,462 --> 03:50:19,522
writer, that it at least changed the way you write.

3445
03:50:19,562 --> 03:50:23,512
- Well, I mean, the book Tripped is a book where I come back with that story to my father, and

3446
03:50:23,542 --> 03:50:27,402
then my father decides to give LSD to my mother. And we did the

3447
03:50:27,782 --> 03:50:31,642
LSD, the three of us, on Christmas. And we

3448
03:50:31,722 --> 03:50:35,182
did mushrooms on Mother's Day. And whenever my mother takes

3449
03:50:35,282 --> 03:50:38,362
LSD, and Alzheimer's is a horrible disease,

3450
03:50:38,442 --> 03:50:42,422
obviously. For example, on Mother's Day, there was the newspaper lying

3451
03:50:42,492 --> 03:50:44,842
on the balcony. We were sitting in the sun, and

3452
03:50:46,542 --> 03:50:50,462
she was on mushrooms. It's just a microdose, you know? It's not that you have a trip, but

3453
03:50:50,902 --> 03:50:54,842
you have that stimulation of your brain.

3454
03:50:54,862 --> 03:50:58,822
That's what you have. Even her brain, attacked by Alzheimer's,

3455
03:50:58,882 --> 03:51:02,622
reacted stronger than my father. He always says, "I never feel anything

3456
03:51:03,382 --> 03:51:07,062
from a microdose." And you're not supposed to feel anything, but my mother suddenly picked up the

3457
03:51:07,102 --> 03:51:10,862
newspaper, which she hadn't looked at for a year. So on

3458
03:51:10,922 --> 03:51:14,522
mushroom microdoses, she picks up the newspaper and starts reading the

3459
03:51:14,582 --> 03:51:18,442
headline to us, which was about the Ukraine war.

3460
03:51:18,542 --> 03:51:22,382
She'd never heard about the Ukraine war. So when she, like, she had problems,

3461
03:51:22,422 --> 03:51:26,231
like, pronouncing the word Ukraine, because that was a new word for her,

3462
03:51:26,282 --> 03:51:29,572
because she hadn't been part of the news cycle in about a

3463
03:51:29,722 --> 03:51:33,442
year. And this was because of the mushroom microdose. So this book,

3464
03:51:34,762 --> 03:51:42,474
how did it change my writing? On an emotional level, writing... ...Right.

3465
03:51:42,534 --> 03:51:49,744
Taking LSD and then writing about LSD changed something in my family. It improved

3466
03:51:49,774 --> 03:51:53,434
the health of my mother that made me very

3467
03:51:53,474 --> 03:51:55,444
happy, of course, very satisfied, you know?

3468
03:51:55,494 --> 03:51:59,754
- Yeah, there's a deep personal connection, but I even mean on Ken Kesey's side, like...

3469
03:51:59,834 --> 03:52:01,834
- I know what you mean.

3470
03:52:03,474 --> 03:52:07,404
- I mean, what does it do? Listen, writing, I don't know.

3471
03:52:07,474 --> 03:52:12,204
Again, me as a fan of writing, it feels like writing is

3472
03:52:13,734 --> 03:52:17,274
suffering, kind of. When I see, just these great

3473
03:52:17,334 --> 03:52:21,194
writers in history talk about writing, it seems like it's really hard,

3474
03:52:21,234 --> 03:52:25,034
it's a kind of torture. You know, Hemingway, and you have

3475
03:52:25,114 --> 03:52:28,054
the Kerouac stories that just kind of flow out of you.

3476
03:52:28,114 --> 03:52:32,014
But a lot of times, it's really disciplined, day

3477
03:52:32,054 --> 03:52:35,954
after day. You're really digging and digging. And so, it's interesting

3478
03:52:35,994 --> 03:52:39,094
what that looks like under the different supplements, right? Like,

3479
03:52:39,334 --> 03:52:39,494
- Well-

3480
03:52:39,504 --> 03:52:43,294
- Stephen King famously, I mean, there's a lot of people, they go to the

3481
03:52:43,314 --> 03:52:46,754
drugs, to the alcohol. You have the Hunter S. Thompson, who

3482
03:52:46,814 --> 03:52:52,284
goes, when given the option, just says yes to all of it. Um,

3483
03:52:53,594 --> 03:52:57,464
and the mind is a weird thing. And a lot of writers talk

3484
03:52:57,534 --> 03:53:01,284
about how they're not really developing the ideas. They're plugging

3485
03:53:01,314 --> 03:53:02,084
into some, they're channeling.

3486
03:53:03,614 --> 03:53:03,624
- Right

3487
03:53:03,624 --> 03:53:06,134
- a voice from somewhere else. And-

3488
03:53:06,154 --> 03:53:06,314
- Yeah

3489
03:53:06,414 --> 03:53:10,974
- with psychedelics, that's certainly, it feels like you're modifying the channel.

3490
03:53:12,814 --> 03:53:14,274
or you're expanding the channel.

3491
03:53:14,454 --> 03:53:14,514
- Yeah

3492
03:53:14,534 --> 03:53:18,774
- Or you're directing the channel to a different direction. That's why I asked.

3493
03:53:18,874 --> 03:53:21,514
- I think for me, writing has two

3494
03:53:23,454 --> 03:53:27,254
important parts, and one of them is the actual writing

3495
03:53:27,314 --> 03:53:31,494
part, and that's the painful part that you talk about.

3496
03:53:32,454 --> 03:53:40,134
It's basically discipline, focus. It becomes harder and harder to

3497
03:53:40,194 --> 03:53:41,754
focus because of the telephone.

3498
03:53:42,354 --> 03:53:43,634
- Yeah, distractions.

3499
03:53:43,654 --> 03:53:47,464
- There's a place in Switzerland, The Nietzsche House. I go there as much as I can to write.

3500
03:53:47,514 --> 03:53:50,834
It's in Sils Maria, it's quite high up. Nietzsche went

3501
03:53:50,873 --> 03:53:57,774
there every summer from 1882 to 1888, with the exception of 1887. He didn't go

3502
03:53:57,814 --> 03:54:01,604
that summer, I don't know why. And he stayed there for three

3503
03:54:01,714 --> 03:54:04,234
months and wrote most of his work

3504
03:54:04,274 --> 03:54:04,854
- Yeah

3505
03:54:04,874 --> 03:54:08,454
- in that room. And that room is still there, and his desk is still there.

3506
03:54:08,594 --> 03:54:12,414
And you can rent rooms in that Nietzsche House, and it's great. And I do this

3507
03:54:12,454 --> 03:54:16,134
as often as I can. Only there am I able to

3508
03:54:16,214 --> 03:54:20,194
switch off the phone in the morning. I don't even switch it on. I'm like

3509
03:54:20,254 --> 03:54:24,094
a soldier. I'm in the Nietzsche House. Also, Nietzsche

3510
03:54:24,154 --> 03:54:27,984
House is magical, so it gives you so much. I

3511
03:54:28,114 --> 03:54:31,663
would never take drugs in the Nietzsche House, because it would disturb that

3512
03:54:31,734 --> 03:54:37,894
clarity that is in that house. When Nietzsche wrote Zarathustra and...

3513
03:54:37,914 --> 03:54:39,754
- You can sense his presence a little bit?

3514
03:54:39,814 --> 03:54:41,434
- Yeah, I speak to him quite a bit. Like...

3515
03:54:41,494 --> 03:54:41,734
- Yeah?

3516
03:54:41,774 --> 03:54:42,994
- His door is always open.

3517
03:54:43,014 --> 03:54:44,574
- Is he an asshole? Is he a nice guy?

3518
03:54:44,634 --> 03:54:45,404
- No, he's a nice guy.

3519
03:54:45,454 --> 03:54:45,974
- Nice guy.

3520
03:54:46,014 --> 03:54:52,054
- His room cannot be rented. It's always like a museum-type room. And I mean,

3521
03:54:54,034 --> 03:54:58,594
I never thought of him as an asshole. I mean, he's a total weirdo, obviously.

3522
03:54:58,634 --> 03:55:01,524
- had issues, like, struggled getting laid.

3523
03:55:01,574 --> 03:55:03,294
- Yeah, I think he had a lot of problems.

3524
03:55:04,134 --> 03:55:07,484
- That's one of them. But he had a lot of good qualities too.

3525
03:55:07,494 --> 03:55:11,334
- But he's also part of Stoned Sapiens, because he did experiment

3526
03:55:11,374 --> 03:55:15,304
with drugs there and he writes about it. It's very hard to find, but in the Nietzsche House,

3527
03:55:15,394 --> 03:55:18,894
I found a book on Nietzsche's medicine

3528
03:55:18,954 --> 03:55:24,354
history, and he takes quite a bit of hashish, he smokes. Is it to help?

3529
03:55:24,364 --> 03:55:25,943
- Does it help with the stomach issues or whatever, or is it...

3530
03:55:25,943 --> 03:55:28,244
- No, he's interested in what happens in the brain, and this...

3531
03:55:28,294 --> 03:55:28,704
- Oh, interesting.

3532
03:55:28,714 --> 03:55:32,554
- ... this comes back to your question how did...

3533
03:55:32,634 --> 03:55:36,514
The drugs change my writing? Well, first of all, it's this one. It's

3534
03:55:36,534 --> 03:55:40,274
this discipline. I can do it up in the Nietzsche House. I can also do it sometimes in

3535
03:55:40,314 --> 03:55:44,154
Berlin. It's just sitting there, trying to focus and writing. But what you

3536
03:55:44,174 --> 03:55:49,814
need, of course, is the inspirational part. And LSD helped me just the first trip

3537
03:55:50,634 --> 03:55:54,354
to realize that it's not all black and white. The world's

3538
03:55:54,394 --> 03:55:58,314
quite colorful, and there's like the abyss and it's,

3539
03:55:58,353 --> 03:56:02,163
there's also the horror. And I was a happy-go-lucky kid, you

3540
03:56:02,214 --> 03:56:05,914
know. I never thought that the world is so deep as I understand it

3541
03:56:05,974 --> 03:56:09,954
now. So the LSD makes the world deeper.

3542
03:56:10,014 --> 03:56:13,854
So I think for me to understand the world better, to understand myself

3543
03:56:13,894 --> 03:56:18,514
better, it improved my writing, but I would not write on LSD.

3544
03:56:19,114 --> 03:56:22,654
Because on LSD, you want to walk in the forest or you want to go up the

3545
03:56:22,734 --> 03:56:26,614
mountain, or that's what I like. I would never sit

3546
03:56:26,654 --> 03:56:30,584
in front of the ugly computer with a stupid screen and write, you

3547
03:56:30,614 --> 03:56:34,414
know. Maybe I would lie in the mountains with a notebook and

3548
03:56:34,514 --> 03:56:42,414
kind of write poetic lines. That could be done on LSD, because you have...

3549
03:56:42,454 --> 03:56:46,304
When I was researching Stoned Sapiens, I did one LSD trip in...

3550
03:56:46,334 --> 03:56:50,304
from the Nietzsche House, I went quite high up in the mountains on LSD, and

3551
03:56:50,434 --> 03:56:54,244
I came and it was not just, it's just, I...

3552
03:56:54,294 --> 03:56:57,974
I just thought about the book and kind of looked at the different chapters, just did

3553
03:56:58,434 --> 03:57:02,084
work together, like, kind of like macro without taking too many

3554
03:57:02,174 --> 03:57:06,104
notes, just kind of letting it, you know, play out in front of, in

3555
03:57:06,154 --> 03:57:10,624
in my mind. And then when I walked down, I passed a cave.

3556
03:57:11,514 --> 03:57:14,324
... and I realized a lot about

3557
03:57:15,194 --> 03:57:18,814
people's relationship to caves and the cave paintings,

3558
03:57:18,934 --> 03:57:22,534
how, you know, actually the cave

3559
03:57:22,674 --> 03:57:26,554
walls, you see all the arteries of the rocks. And I mean,

3560
03:57:26,614 --> 03:57:30,354
on LSD, you see all of that and you see how alive that is

3561
03:57:30,394 --> 03:57:35,714
and how beautiful it actually was by humans to then use that canvas.

3562
03:57:36,634 --> 03:57:40,394
and work your cave paintings in there. I mean, I never

3563
03:57:40,434 --> 03:57:43,014
had the appreciation of that before.

3564
03:57:43,034 --> 03:57:45,854
- Yeah, you're right. You are able to detect

3565
03:57:45,894 --> 03:57:51,094
the on psychedelics, the aliveness of the details, if I can put it this way.

3566
03:57:51,154 --> 03:57:54,954
- For me, it's a very creative drug. But for other people it might not

3567
03:57:55,034 --> 03:57:58,994
be, you know? So I cannot advertise it, because

3568
03:57:59,074 --> 03:58:03,214
if you have a psychological problem, maybe it's overwhelming.

3569
03:58:03,274 --> 03:58:07,254
- Yeah, that's actually a good thing to say at this moment, from my

3570
03:58:07,274 --> 03:58:11,254
perspective, and maybe you can comment on it. In general, when people ask me,

3571
03:58:11,294 --> 03:58:14,704
I've done psilocybin a few times and I did ayahuasca, and I've talked about

3572
03:58:14,734 --> 03:58:18,574
it. When people ask me if I recommend those things,

3573
03:58:18,654 --> 03:58:22,574
I, as a general statement, I say no. You know,

3574
03:58:22,714 --> 03:58:26,674
to the general population. And then as a second step, if I'm

3575
03:58:26,714 --> 03:58:30,134
talking to specific people on a case-by-case basis, I can just discuss my

3576
03:58:30,174 --> 03:58:33,794
experience and let that be kind of an inspiration. Because I'm very

3577
03:58:33,854 --> 03:58:38,924
hesitant to recommend a thing that could be so powerful. Because I don't know.

3578
03:58:38,954 --> 03:58:41,074
Like I had a tremendously positive experience,

3579
03:58:42,114 --> 03:58:45,714
and I was sure I would be meeting some demons. I thought I would have some

3580
03:58:45,754 --> 03:58:49,454
demons in the basement or something, but I didn't meet them, not yet.

3581
03:58:49,554 --> 03:58:51,834
And my... But people might have some demons

3582
03:58:51,994 --> 03:58:55,444
that they meet and then it might destroy them or it might

3583
03:58:55,874 --> 03:58:59,834
change them in a way they don't like. And

3584
03:58:59,914 --> 03:59:01,654
actually, it's a good question for me whether

3585
03:59:02,734 --> 03:59:06,694
it's good to do psychedelics when you're in a good place in life or in a bad place in

3586
03:59:06,754 --> 03:59:10,714
life. Because I know that, even scientifically there have been

3587
03:59:10,814 --> 03:59:14,634
studies where psilocybin helps with extreme sort of

3588
03:59:14,674 --> 03:59:18,544
depression and PTSD and all these kinds of things. But

3589
03:59:18,594 --> 03:59:22,314
I'd be very nervous about that too, because

3590
03:59:23,174 --> 03:59:27,034
the mind is such a powerful thing and it's such a complicated thing that

3591
03:59:27,874 --> 03:59:31,774
with these really powerful tools it's unclear where it's going to

3592
03:59:31,834 --> 03:59:35,194
take you. But I have heard a lot of stories

3593
03:59:36,374 --> 03:59:39,894
of people who have taken incredible journeys, sometimes difficult journeys, with

3594
03:59:39,914 --> 03:59:47,214
psychedelics and have come out much happier and much freer

3595
03:59:47,314 --> 03:59:51,274
and have healed some of the things they have been going through. But when people ask me to

3596
03:59:51,314 --> 03:59:52,154
recommend or not,

3597
03:59:53,434 --> 03:59:57,163
I'm just too afraid to say yes. I think the right thing is always just in

3598
03:59:57,294 --> 03:59:59,214
general, no. Be very careful.

3599
03:59:59,354 --> 04:00:04,564
- Yeah, I think it would be irresponsible to recommend it to people you don't see.

3600
04:00:04,594 --> 04:00:10,074
You know? Maybe if you know a friend and the friend asks you,

3601
04:00:10,154 --> 04:00:14,114
then you could... Maybe I would say to a friend, "Yeah, I think you

3602
04:00:14,154 --> 04:00:16,114
would be fine taking it."

3603
04:00:16,154 --> 04:00:20,454
But even that is a big responsibility, you know, because LSD

3604
04:00:21,574 --> 04:00:25,454
in German, the book "Trip" is called "The Strongest Substance," and it is

3605
04:00:25,514 --> 04:00:28,834
actually the strongest substance because it works in microgram dosages.

3606
04:00:29,894 --> 04:00:35,994
Like, even the strongest snake poison, cobra toxin, if you use that in

3607
04:00:36,054 --> 04:00:42,374
microgram dosages, you don't feel anything. But if you take 250 micrograms of

3608
04:00:42,474 --> 04:00:46,374
LSD, it can totally overpower you. And

3609
04:00:46,474 --> 04:00:51,514
if you have an unstable psyche, it could, you know, make, turn you mad, you know?

3610
04:00:51,534 --> 04:00:56,163
- Do you understand how it compares to psilocybin and ayahuasca and DMT?

3611
04:00:56,174 --> 04:01:01,994
How does LSD compare to those? Is it similar territory, just more intense?

3612
04:01:02,014 --> 04:01:04,744
- Well, LSD and psilocybin are like cousins.

3613
04:01:04,754 --> 04:01:05,714
- Distant cousins or-

3614
04:01:05,774 --> 04:01:11,003
- No, quite close cousins. And I spoke to a neuroscientist from a

3615
04:01:11,054 --> 04:01:18,454
university clinic in Zurich, who's been researching psilocybin and LSD since

3616
04:01:18,494 --> 04:01:22,454
the early '90s. And he puts people in, uh, in

3617
04:01:22,494 --> 04:01:29,994
brain scanners, for example. So he sees exactly what happens in the brain on LSD

3618
04:01:30,074 --> 04:01:33,994
or on psilocybin. And he said to me when I asked him that very

3619
04:01:34,034 --> 04:01:37,514
same question, he said, "LSD is the more sophisticated

3620
04:01:37,614 --> 04:01:42,554
molecule." He meant by that is that LSD

3621
04:01:43,514 --> 04:01:47,164
docks onto more receptors than psilocybin. Like,

3622
04:01:47,194 --> 04:01:51,084
psilocybin interacts with like five different types of receptors in

3623
04:01:51,114 --> 04:01:54,834
the brain and LSD like with nine. So that makes LSD a more

3624
04:01:54,914 --> 04:01:58,614
complex molecule. So that's why it already

3625
04:01:58,674 --> 04:02:02,314
works in very small quantities, because it's like the key is perfect for our brain.

3626
04:02:02,394 --> 04:02:06,073
Our brain really reacts strongly to

3627
04:02:06,154 --> 04:02:10,064
LSD. For psilocybin you have to take milligrams, not

3628
04:02:10,194 --> 04:02:14,004
micrograms, but milligrams. So mushrooms are

3629
04:02:14,094 --> 04:02:17,914
also described as the softer, you know, psychedelic

3630
04:02:17,954 --> 04:02:21,614
experience because it only lasts for like five hours, whereas LSD lasts

3631
04:02:21,794 --> 04:02:24,874
like eight hours. And LSD can be more

3632
04:02:26,874 --> 04:02:30,794
LSD is also a mushroom, but it's an ergot, which is a mushroom,

3633
04:02:30,934 --> 04:02:34,374
but it's turned into a diethylamide. It's the,

3634
04:02:34,894 --> 04:02:42,794
you extract the potent acid from ergot, which is lysergic acid, and you turn

3635
04:02:42,854 --> 04:02:46,774
that into a diethylamide. So it's a processed drug

3636
04:02:46,814 --> 04:02:50,374
in a way. It's a potent processed drug that works

3637
04:02:50,914 --> 04:02:54,893
also for mass movements quite well. That's why it was so popular in the '60s, because people could just

3638
04:02:54,954 --> 04:02:58,884
make it. While mushrooms, they kind of, they have to grow. Like,

3639
04:02:58,934 --> 04:03:02,754
the hippie movement, they could never have sustained on

3640
04:03:02,794 --> 04:03:05,294
mushrooms because so many mushrooms don't even grow.

3641
04:03:07,154 --> 04:03:12,374
A good LSD chemist can make LSD for the whole world, basically.

3642
04:03:12,434 --> 04:03:19,104
- Can we go back to something we talked about in the beginning about Berlin? Is

3643
04:03:19,774 --> 04:03:23,554
it'd be fascinating to learn more about this culture. Are you still

3644
04:03:23,614 --> 04:03:27,374
connected? I'm sure you've been to some wild parties. I've been told that

3645
04:03:27,394 --> 04:03:30,074
Berlin has some wild parties.

3646
04:03:30,174 --> 04:03:33,854
- Well, it had them in the '90s. I mean, it had the best clubs that

3647
04:03:34,094 --> 04:03:37,714
I... I mean, it was just a dream. You go into this club. But I was also in my

3648
04:03:37,754 --> 04:03:40,844
mid-20s, so I would go into this club, I'd take MDMA,

3649
04:03:41,694 --> 04:03:45,314
and the DJ is amazing and the sound system is crazy, and there's like

3650
04:03:45,534 --> 04:03:48,354
500 people on MDMA just dancing for like eight hours.

3651
04:03:48,394 --> 04:03:50,214
- And that's when electronic music was really—

3652
04:03:50,334 --> 04:03:55,890
- Yeah, it was really good. Like, a friend of mine, he runs a club of visionaries,

3653
04:03:55,910 --> 04:03:59,750
which is kind of a famous underground club in Berlin. And he asked me in the early

3654
04:03:59,890 --> 04:04:03,720
2000s when this club was offered to him, "Should I do this?" I said,

3655
04:04:03,720 --> 04:04:07,700
"Gregor, techno is over, you know, electronic music is dead." But obviously it's not

3656
04:04:07,770 --> 04:04:11,550
dead, it's still going on, but in the '90s it was new.

3657
04:04:11,850 --> 04:04:15,510
So it was... You really went into the club and you heard something you'd never heard

3658
04:04:15,570 --> 04:04:16,250
before. And

3659
04:04:17,210 --> 04:04:20,889
the first time, I came from New York, and New York was a very old-school, kind of

3660
04:04:20,970 --> 04:04:24,570
urban place. I mean, rock and roll or grunge

3661
04:04:24,630 --> 04:04:28,570
music. And I came to Berlin, it was in a club called

3662
04:04:28,690 --> 04:04:32,430
I Am A Bucket in East Berlin, doesn't exist anymore, like, in a rundown, totally

3663
04:04:32,450 --> 04:04:38,030
rundown, like, squat. And I went to the bar and I had a beer,

3664
04:04:38,730 --> 04:04:42,450
and I looked, and there were just a few people on the dance floor, and this like electronic

3665
04:04:42,530 --> 04:04:46,350
music which I'd never heard before. And the guy in front of me, he was

3666
04:04:46,390 --> 04:04:50,250
like... He looked like an East Berlin skinhead, kinda type

3667
04:04:50,290 --> 04:04:53,850
of guy, but, like, totally smiling. I'm sure he was on

3668
04:04:53,890 --> 04:04:57,610
ecstasy, and he was disassembling, like, an imaginary

3669
04:04:57,710 --> 04:05:01,550
machine. And I just looked at this guy, he was like for one hour, he was just doing the

3670
04:05:01,710 --> 04:05:06,490
most- most complicated things. And I was like, this is totally,

3671
04:05:06,650 --> 04:05:10,610
totally different way of moving, and I liked that actually. I liked

3672
04:05:11,610 --> 04:05:15,510
to dance in clubs. Yeah. And I did this for like two years very

3673
04:05:15,530 --> 04:05:17,970
intensely with my girlfriend at the time. We went out a

3674
04:05:18,050 --> 04:05:21,500
lot, like, from Friday to Monday,

3675
04:05:21,590 --> 04:05:25,490
basically. But it means... And a lot of people still do that in Berlin,

3676
04:05:25,530 --> 04:05:29,720
but it means that you can't really work. I mean...

3677
04:05:29,750 --> 04:05:33,680
- Yeah, you escaped that. It's interesting that you were able to do that

3678
04:05:33,690 --> 04:05:38,660
for a short time, just as an experience, and then go on to be extremely productive.

3679
04:05:39,230 --> 04:05:41,690
- For me, it was also kind of research, even though I didn't know this.

3680
04:05:41,710 --> 04:05:45,170
- I mean, life is research in a way, if you allow it to be.

3681
04:05:45,180 --> 04:05:48,990
- I could not have written these books on history and drugs without having

3682
04:05:49,090 --> 04:05:52,970
had these drug experiences, because that... I mean,

3683
04:05:53,110 --> 04:05:56,970
also, like, when I wrote about methamphetamine and the Nazis, I

3684
04:05:57,050 --> 04:06:00,310
asked... At the time, weed was illegal in Germany, so I asked

3685
04:06:00,370 --> 04:06:04,239
a friend of mine, she's a cannabis dealer, I guess you would

3686
04:06:04,290 --> 04:06:07,990
say. I said, "Can you also get me crystal

3687
04:06:08,050 --> 04:06:11,850
meth?" And she was like shocked, like, "No." 'Cause she was a

3688
04:06:11,890 --> 04:06:15,870
weed dealer, but then she found like a Polish guy who actually had crystal meth.

3689
04:06:15,880 --> 04:06:19,670
I just wanted to have it. It was like the Paul Schrader thing when he wrote the

3690
04:06:19,710 --> 04:06:22,840
screenplay to Taxi Driver, he had like a gun in his drawer.

3691
04:06:23,030 --> 04:06:26,840
So he would play, you know, get the vibe of, like, danger. And so I wanted to have this

3692
04:06:26,870 --> 04:06:30,850
crystal meth. So this Polish guy sold it to me, and he gave

3693
04:06:30,890 --> 04:06:34,490
me without me saying anything. And maybe

3694
04:06:34,910 --> 04:06:38,570
my friend, maybe she said, "He's a writer" or something, but he gave me a

3695
04:06:38,630 --> 04:06:41,670
Xerox. He gave me the methamphetamine, one gram, and the Xerox

3696
04:06:41,730 --> 04:06:45,450
copy of the r- the patent of

3697
04:06:45,520 --> 04:06:50,850
Pervitin from 1938, so this was a crystal meth dealer that actually had historical-

3698
04:06:50,890 --> 04:06:51,910
- Mm-hmm. Knowledge, yeah.

3699
04:06:52,010 --> 04:06:53,210
- ...knowledge about it. So,

3700
04:06:53,230 --> 04:06:54,950
- Did you, did you ever try?

3701
04:06:55,010 --> 04:06:58,559
- Yeah, well then I tried it, because I really wanted... I could not really

3702
04:06:59,730 --> 04:07:03,700
write about it in the same way without having tried it. I

3703
04:07:03,730 --> 04:07:07,370
can't recommend it. It feels very toxic, like, when you take a

3704
04:07:07,390 --> 04:07:11,350
psychedelic. I can say this with a clear conscience, it's not toxic. LSD is

3705
04:07:11,370 --> 04:07:14,430
not toxic, it doesn't poison you. You might have

3706
04:07:15,590 --> 04:07:19,310
reactions in your brain that are too much for you, but if you

3707
04:07:19,370 --> 04:07:23,250
snort crystal meth it goes on your central nervous system, your heart

3708
04:07:23,310 --> 04:07:27,270
starts pounding, your blood pressure rises, so it's stressful on

3709
04:07:27,290 --> 04:07:29,950
the organism, it's toxic, you know.

3710
04:07:29,970 --> 04:07:33,550
... but still, you know, the effect in the brain is not so interesting as with LSD.

3711
04:07:33,570 --> 04:07:37,010
Like, you couldn't go crazy, I would say, on- on crystal meth, you just have,

3712
04:07:37,030 --> 04:07:40,920
like, you're just very much awake but you don't have, like, crazy thoughts that

3713
04:07:40,950 --> 04:07:44,710
you can't, you know, evaluate anymore. So it's a very, very, very different

3714
04:07:44,770 --> 04:07:48,660
drug, but taking that of course made me understand better how a soldier feels in the

3715
04:07:48,690 --> 04:07:50,690
tank taking it.

3716
04:07:50,870 --> 04:07:54,740
- Yeah. Yeah, I think that's really, really important to do. Um, I- I

3717
04:07:54,770 --> 04:07:58,510
have to ask, your friend Alex, who's... I- th- it sounds like he's taken every

3718
04:07:58,570 --> 04:08:02,870
single drug there is. Has he spoken about, like, what's the most

3719
04:08:04,050 --> 04:08:11,270
interesting drug? What's his favorite drug? He seems like a connoisseur, right?

3720
04:08:11,290 --> 04:08:13,210
- But he's not a psychedelic guy, so.

3721
04:08:13,310 --> 04:08:15,909
- Oh, well then, okay.

3722
04:08:15,950 --> 04:08:17,990
- More i- he's more into the addictive drugs.

3723
04:08:18,030 --> 04:08:21,970
- It's very difficult, I guess... Yeah, that would be a

3724
04:08:22,070 --> 04:08:28,730
special person that can be a full-on explorer of the drug space.

3725
04:08:29,830 --> 04:08:33,650
'Cause if you get into psychedelics, then you don't really want to do the hard drugs,

3726
04:08:33,670 --> 04:08:37,010
really want to do the hard drugs, and if you get the hard drugs you don't wanna-

3727
04:08:37,050 --> 04:08:38,860
- Right. They contradict each other.

3728
04:08:38,950 --> 04:08:40,690
- They do contradict each other. Yeah.

3729
04:08:40,730 --> 04:08:44,970
- It's why we spend less and less time together.

3730
04:08:46,710 --> 04:08:51,310
- Um, Since you mentioned Kerouac. Listen, I love Kerouac.

3731
04:08:52,150 --> 04:08:57,350
Do we know any sort of famous writers that have used drugs as part of their writing?

3732
04:08:58,190 --> 04:08:59,470
So Kerouac is one.

3733
04:08:59,490 --> 04:09:03,440
- Do we an- do we know any famous writers who have not used drugs as part of their writing?

3734
04:09:03,470 --> 04:09:07,160
- Interesting. So, wait, I didn't actually know, to be honest, this

3735
04:09:07,190 --> 04:09:08,860
story. I- I love Kerouac-

3736
04:09:08,870 --> 04:09:12,290
- That's the good thing about being a writer, you can take drugs on the job and no one will

3737
04:09:13,130 --> 04:09:16,470
cancel you for it. If you're like a politician you can't really do it.

3738
04:09:16,510 --> 04:09:19,110
- That's right. Rock... You can be a rock star or you can be a writer.

3739
04:09:19,130 --> 04:09:20,810
- Yeah. You can be an artist and take drugs.

3740
04:09:20,870 --> 04:09:22,560
- You mentioned that Kerouac did what?

3741
04:09:22,610 --> 04:09:23,280
- Amphetamine.

3742
04:09:23,310 --> 04:09:23,770
- Amphetamine.

3743
04:09:23,780 --> 04:09:27,650
- Speed. Basically speed. The legend has it that On The Road

3744
04:09:27,670 --> 04:09:33,190
was written in two weeks on speed, basically without sleeping, and using an endless

3745
04:09:34,030 --> 04:09:34,650
paper roll.

3746
04:09:34,710 --> 04:09:35,160
- Yeah. The whole scroll. Yeah.

3747
04:09:35,160 --> 04:09:39,020
- in this typewriter, so he was just writing. And I can imagine that you can write

3748
04:09:39,050 --> 04:09:42,370
a hell of a lot on amphetamines, and I do it sometimes,

3749
04:09:42,390 --> 04:09:46,000
but I don't do it a lot, you know. So I can take

3750
04:09:46,030 --> 04:09:49,780
amphetamines and have a really good time and write, like, 20 pages, but then the

3751
04:09:49,850 --> 04:09:53,820
next day I wouldn't do it anymore. But he decided, "Okay, for

3752
04:09:53,890 --> 04:09:58,260
14 days I'm gonna do it." Philip K. Dick was an amphetamine writer.

3753
04:09:58,490 --> 04:10:01,955
And also, I think if you take a lot of amphetamines, you get

3754
04:10:02,006 --> 04:10:05,806
into kind of psychedelic spaces at a certain point in time where you start

3755
04:10:05,866 --> 04:10:09,606
hallucinating, and... like, if you write, you know, Blade

3756
04:10:09,686 --> 04:10:12,706
Runner, maybe it helps you. So amphetamines are also

3757
04:10:14,706 --> 04:10:18,626
they can be creative, I guess. It's just not, I don't, it's not

3758
04:10:18,706 --> 04:10:22,626
my type of drug. And they're certainly not as creative as

3759
04:10:22,886 --> 04:10:26,656
But it also depends on the person. Like, Malcolm Lowry,

3760
04:10:27,086 --> 04:10:30,446
Under the Volcano, he was drinking a lot.

3761
04:10:30,606 --> 04:10:34,546
Or Hemingway was drinking a lot, and they could only write when they're drunk.

3762
04:10:35,526 --> 04:10:37,906
When I'm drunk, I can't write. I just can't do it.

3763
04:10:37,966 --> 04:10:40,926
- Write drunk, edit sober.

3764
04:10:40,996 --> 04:10:44,876
- And that's advisable. Like, if I would write something on amphetamines,

3765
04:10:44,886 --> 04:10:47,316
I would certainly edit it sober, of course, because on

3766
04:10:47,346 --> 04:10:51,306
amphetamines, your self-criticism is lowered because you

3767
04:10:51,326 --> 04:10:55,226
feel so good. Like, you feel so confident. You just write, and... But writing

3768
04:10:56,046 --> 04:10:59,866
is about nuances, especially literary writing. Maybe a non-fiction

3769
04:10:59,926 --> 04:11:03,906
book would be easy on amphetamines, but a novel, it's all

3770
04:11:03,966 --> 04:11:07,366
about you have to be very, very open. Amphetamines

3771
04:11:07,426 --> 04:11:11,136
close you. You become like a machine, like, you write. But

3772
04:11:11,686 --> 04:11:15,466
if you're on the right track, like Kerouac with On The Road, he had the right,

3773
04:11:15,506 --> 04:11:19,416
you know, he was on, he was going, you know? But you could also be on

3774
04:11:19,446 --> 04:11:23,006
the wrong one and then write 200 pages, and you just have to throw it

3775
04:11:23,066 --> 04:11:26,506
away. And probably he did a lot of that also, you know?

3776
04:11:26,606 --> 04:11:31,066
- Yeah. And also, On The Road is a particular kind of book.

3777
04:11:31,126 --> 04:11:32,266
- It's an amphetamine book.

3778
04:11:32,446 --> 04:11:36,486
- You want the spontaneity, the speed of...

3779
04:11:36,546 --> 04:11:41,966
- It's about speed. It's about moving fast, but not stopping. It is a speed book.

3780
04:11:42,066 --> 04:11:43,146
That's a great book.

3781
04:11:43,166 --> 04:11:46,986
- It's such a great book. It's such a great book. But then I've recently

3782
04:11:47,046 --> 04:11:51,006
been rereading all of Dostoevsky. So, so going

3783
04:11:51,026 --> 04:11:54,856
through Notes on the Underground, The Idiot, Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov.

3784
04:11:54,926 --> 04:11:55,196
And that, I don't think...

3785
04:11:55,206 --> 04:11:56,426
- Which one's your favorite?

3786
04:11:56,446 --> 04:11:59,546
- Brothers Karamazov. Well, I read in both Russian and English.

3787
04:12:00,386 --> 04:12:06,816
And for the longest time, it was The Idiot. Until ...

3788
04:12:08,086 --> 04:12:11,866
It's a complicated philosophical issue. When I was younger, I

3789
04:12:11,906 --> 04:12:16,426
thought Prince Myshkin, the main character in The Idiot, was not

3790
04:12:18,066 --> 04:12:22,046
as flawed as I believe he is now. I think Dostoevsky tried to create a

3791
04:12:22,086 --> 04:12:24,826
Jesus-like character in Prince Myshkin.

3792
04:12:24,906 --> 04:12:25,206
- Right.

3793
04:12:25,266 --> 04:12:29,086
- and I think kind of failed because he was,

3794
04:12:29,166 --> 04:12:33,156
too giving in a way that was actually counterproductive and

3795
04:12:33,206 --> 04:12:36,906
destructive to the world, which is he tried to fix in The Brothers Karamazov with

3796
04:12:36,986 --> 04:12:40,806
Alyosha Karamazov. But anyway, I don't think you could

3797
04:12:40,846 --> 04:12:46,556
do that. I'd be very surprised to learn that Dostoevsky did any drugs.

3798
04:12:46,606 --> 04:12:48,426
- Also, there was not so much available.

3799
04:12:48,436 --> 04:12:49,566
- That's true.

3800
04:12:49,626 --> 04:12:55,586
- Alcohol, of course, nicotine, coffee. Those are really powerful drugs.

3801
04:12:55,595 --> 04:12:59,376
- And I'm also doing a podcast with Chuck Palahniuk, author of

3802
04:12:59,466 --> 04:13:02,146
Fight Club and many other amazing books.

3803
04:13:02,266 --> 04:13:06,186
- Yeah, he's a great writer. Fight Club influenced me quite

3804
04:13:06,226 --> 04:13:11,556
a bit. I think the novel is even better, maybe, than the movie.

3805
04:13:11,566 --> 04:13:12,926
But the movie's great.

3806
04:13:12,946 --> 04:13:16,806
- I mean, in that case, as he said, the movie is great and that

3807
04:13:16,926 --> 04:13:20,726
is almost like a bigger than life thing.

3808
04:13:20,786 --> 04:13:24,926
Sometimes the book and the movie and those things can influence culture.

3809
04:13:24,986 --> 04:13:26,626
- That certainly influenced culture.

3810
04:13:26,666 --> 04:13:30,566
- To where, like, "Okay, this has a life of its own." I'd like to think

3811
04:13:30,586 --> 04:13:36,766
some of your work might influence how we perceive history. That's really

3812
04:13:36,786 --> 04:13:40,716
important. That's really powerful. To not just change, but to sort of

3813
04:13:40,826 --> 04:13:44,406
expand our conception of history, which is important to

3814
04:13:44,446 --> 04:13:48,166
do. Are there particular books, fiction or non-fiction?

3815
04:13:48,186 --> 04:13:52,106
So you were both a fiction writer and a non-fiction writer. Are there books

3816
04:13:52,166 --> 04:13:53,226
that had an influence on you?

3817
04:13:53,406 --> 04:13:57,946
- Yeah, it's Ulysses by James Joyce.

3818
04:13:58,886 --> 04:14:02,666
Ulysses is good, but only when you're in your early 20s, living in New

3819
04:14:02,746 --> 04:14:06,866
York, and you're writing your first book, and you just have taken LSD.

3820
04:14:06,926 --> 04:14:07,366
- Oh, nice.

3821
04:14:07,406 --> 04:14:09,296
- Then I read it, and then it opened...

3822
04:14:09,306 --> 04:14:10,746
- It made sense?

3823
04:14:11,406 --> 04:14:14,926
- Well, it just showed, it's just a very

3824
04:14:14,966 --> 04:14:18,906
experimental novel, so it opens up. You don't have to understand everything,

3825
04:14:18,945 --> 04:14:19,926
but it shows you

3826
04:14:20,846 --> 04:14:24,626
that there's many different ways of telling a tale, and that was quite interesting to me.

3827
04:14:24,666 --> 04:14:31,876
But the most influential book, maybe, is "The Stranger" by Camus.

3828
04:14:31,986 --> 04:14:34,466
Because I like the language so much, and I'm really

3829
04:14:35,906 --> 04:14:39,746
mostly interested in language. I don't really care what it's about.

3830
04:14:39,806 --> 04:14:44,596
I was lying on the beach in Morocco when I was 20 and reading "The Stranger."

3831
04:14:46,006 --> 04:14:49,896
Then a Moroccan came and he said, "Why are you reading a racist book?"

3832
04:14:49,896 --> 04:14:53,806
I'm like, "What are you talking about? This is world literature." He said, "Yeah, right.

3833
04:14:53,826 --> 04:14:57,546
He's like, killing an Arab without consequence. No, actually there's

3834
04:14:57,586 --> 04:15:00,116
consequence, but no reason, basically. Just because he's bored. So this is racist."

3835
04:15:00,306 --> 04:15:03,786
bored. So this is racist." That was like,

3836
04:15:04,566 --> 04:15:08,206
made no sense to me, that argument, because I was just interested in how

3837
04:15:08,246 --> 04:15:15,906
Camus constructed. It was just for me a stylistic experience to read that.

3838
04:15:16,086 --> 04:15:19,946
- I always love books, and "Stranger" is a short book. I love books that are

3839
04:15:20,006 --> 04:15:26,516
able to accomplish so much in so little, in so few pages, in so few words.

3840
04:15:26,586 --> 04:15:28,056
"The Stranger."

3841
04:15:28,086 --> 04:15:32,026
- There's nothing unnecessary in "The Stranger," and I always try to write a

3842
04:15:32,046 --> 04:15:34,166
book where every sentence is

3843
04:15:35,386 --> 04:15:38,926
just... There's nothing unnecessary in the book. But it's very hard to do,

3844
04:15:38,986 --> 04:15:42,006
actually. Nietzsche could do this.

3845
04:15:42,046 --> 04:15:45,686
Peterson talked about this, that every sentence in Nietzsche is like, chiseled, and it's like,

3846
04:15:45,746 --> 04:15:50,126
perfect. And I think not every- I mean, but that's his tendency.

3847
04:15:50,166 --> 04:15:54,026
He tries to write like this, and that's very hard to achieve. That's actually where the

3848
04:15:54,046 --> 04:15:57,686
writing becomes poetic. So for me, Nietzsche also is like a poet.

3849
04:15:57,846 --> 04:16:01,206
The aphorisms are poetry. So Nietzsche also,

3850
04:16:01,286 --> 04:16:05,166
stylistically, since you asked, was very important to me.

3851
04:16:05,186 --> 04:16:09,116
So Camus, Nietzsche, James Joyce, and then, and Kafka also. I like Kafka always.

3852
04:16:09,146 --> 04:16:15,697
And I like Thomas Mann. I don't know how well he translates, but in German, it's

3853
04:16:15,858 --> 04:16:19,738
interesting his take on how to... It's funny. He's a very funny

3854
04:16:19,818 --> 04:16:26,178
guy. Even though he talks too much, but he's good. So I always wanted

3855
04:16:26,238 --> 04:16:30,188
to have these guys as my colleagues, basically.

3856
04:16:30,197 --> 04:16:33,717
- Mm-hmm. Are they there somewhere in your head as you're writing?

3857
04:16:33,818 --> 04:16:41,018
- Less and less. But it was like an incentive to be part of that club. Like, to be

3858
04:16:41,117 --> 04:16:45,078
able to write a book, and it's out there, and it's perfect,

3859
04:16:45,957 --> 04:16:49,648
and it's... and you are on one level with Camus, you know? It's very hard to

3860
04:16:49,738 --> 04:16:53,558
do. Let's say you become a carpenter, which is also, you know, a very

3861
04:16:53,578 --> 04:16:57,537
challenging job, but you don't have these kind of great... Well, you have Jesus, I guess, as

3862
04:16:57,578 --> 04:16:59,158
your potential colleague.

3863
04:16:59,238 --> 04:16:59,637
- Yeah, true.

3864
04:16:59,658 --> 04:17:03,358
- But for the... I just like these writers, these two.

3865
04:17:03,637 --> 04:17:08,098
So the ones I mentioned, and also then Thomas, Thomas Pynchon.

3866
04:17:08,197 --> 04:17:11,717
who wrote "Gravity's Rainbow," which I think is one of the best novels of the 20th century.

3867
04:17:12,578 --> 04:17:13,777
And I read that in Berlin

3868
04:17:14,797 --> 04:17:18,658
in the late '90s, and it really blew my mind. I thought it... I think it's an

3869
04:17:18,717 --> 04:17:22,658
absolute masterpiece. The intensity of this

3870
04:17:22,697 --> 04:17:29,758
novel, "Gravity's Rainbow," is unparalleled, and I'm still puzzled by how he did it.

3871
04:17:30,717 --> 04:17:34,398
And it's not known how he did it, because he lives... He lives a completely obscure

3872
04:17:34,478 --> 04:17:40,957
life. No one knows basically who he is. So he's also a very interesting colleague.

3873
04:17:40,978 --> 04:17:44,838
- It's widely regarded as one of the most challenging and significant works

3874
04:17:44,877 --> 04:17:46,377
of postmodern literature.

3875
04:17:46,438 --> 04:17:47,047
- It's pretty good.

3876
04:17:47,098 --> 04:17:51,078
- Set primarily in Europe at the end of World War II, the novel centers on the design,

3877
04:17:51,098 --> 04:17:54,858
production, and deployment of the German V-2 rocket. The narrative follows

3878
04:17:54,898 --> 04:17:58,277
several characters. It lists the characters.

3879
04:17:58,297 --> 04:18:02,117
- Well, Slothrop is the American agent who's the main character. He

3880
04:18:02,258 --> 04:18:06,188
works for Allied Intelligence, and he's really a funny guy.

3881
04:18:06,197 --> 04:18:09,957
He smokes a lot of weed and he's, like, in Berlin, in bombed out Berlin after the

3882
04:18:09,998 --> 04:18:13,797
war, and it's just funny to go with him through

3883
04:18:13,858 --> 04:18:17,738
that. He's a great character. It's a great novel. It really is.

3884
04:18:17,777 --> 04:18:20,858
- So it does, it does give a window into history also.

3885
04:18:20,877 --> 04:18:24,646
- It does, yeah. But that's not why it's interesting to me. It makes it

3886
04:18:24,697 --> 04:18:28,646
especially interesting because the way he describes

3887
04:18:28,678 --> 04:18:31,717
these situations, it's just the way he writes is phenomenal.

3888
04:18:32,838 --> 04:18:34,457
- Oh, it's a Pulitzer Prize and all.

3889
04:18:34,467 --> 04:18:35,918
- Oh, but I'm sure he didn't take it.

3890
04:18:35,978 --> 04:18:36,646
- On lists.

3891
04:18:37,598 --> 04:18:39,037
- 'Cause, yeah, he declined.

3892
04:18:39,058 --> 04:18:42,957
Well, no one knows who he is. I know a little bit. I know who

3893
04:18:42,998 --> 04:18:46,637
his wife is, but I'm not gonna talk about it. He really wants to protect his

3894
04:18:46,658 --> 04:18:48,877
privacy. And I think that's also amazing.

3895
04:18:48,938 --> 04:18:52,068
- I think that's a beautiful thing, but for me, from my perspective...

3896
04:18:52,078 --> 04:18:53,777
- He wouldn't appear in the podcast?

3897
04:18:53,818 --> 04:18:54,217
- He would not.

3898
04:18:54,238 --> 04:18:55,547
- It would be great if he would come on the podcast.

3899
04:18:55,547 --> 04:19:00,498
- He would not, right. Well, I believe it's possible, but with people like that,

3900
04:19:01,377 --> 04:19:05,358
it has to be a long journey, and it has to... you have to... for me, for example,

3901
04:19:05,418 --> 04:19:09,338
I just interviewed Terence Tao, who's one of the greatest mathematicians,

3902
04:19:09,398 --> 04:19:12,627
one of the greatest living mathematicians, probably one of the greats in history.

3903
04:19:12,637 --> 04:19:15,877
And there's another I wanna speak with, which is Grisha, Grigori

3904
04:19:15,998 --> 04:19:19,797
Perelman, who's a Russian mathematician, who's more

3905
04:19:19,818 --> 04:19:23,678
akin to Thomas Pynchon. He declined the Millennial Prize, the one,

3906
04:19:23,717 --> 04:19:27,678
one million dollars. He declined all the prize Fields Medal, Breakthrough Prize in

3907
04:19:27,697 --> 04:19:31,558
Mathematics. He declined everything, and he just lives with his

3908
04:19:31,617 --> 04:19:34,358
mom now, quit mathematics.

3909
04:19:34,418 --> 04:19:37,117
- Like Kirilov, he also lived with his mom. Mm-hmm.

3910
04:19:37,137 --> 04:19:40,137
- There's something really beautiful about a human being like that.

3911
04:19:40,238 --> 04:19:41,037
- Right.

3912
04:19:41,217 --> 04:19:42,078
- Um, especially

3913
04:19:43,158 --> 04:19:46,957
because in his case it was done for principles. Like, he has a certain set of principles,

3914
04:19:47,678 --> 04:19:52,008
and no amount of money, nothing could buy him or ...

3915
04:19:52,078 --> 04:19:54,008
- Yeah, that's amazing actually.

3916
04:19:54,037 --> 04:19:57,377
- Yeah. I had somebody tell me this,

3917
04:19:58,277 --> 04:20:02,228
a really interesting guy I met a few days ago said that

3918
04:20:02,358 --> 04:20:09,358
there's nothing, there's nothing more exhilarating. Perhaps only a rich person can

3919
04:20:09,398 --> 04:20:14,418
say this, but there's nothing more exhilarating than saying no to a lot of money.

3920
04:20:15,758 --> 04:20:19,478
But he said, he said it with so much confidence that

3921
04:20:19,838 --> 04:20:27,438
I somehow believed him. But the deeper truth there is living by

3922
04:20:27,478 --> 04:20:31,238
principles and having integrity. There is something deeply

3923
04:20:31,258 --> 04:20:35,047
fulfilling. If that means saying no to money, or if

3924
04:20:35,137 --> 04:20:39,078
that means standing up to Hitler, and then risking your life, that's

3925
04:20:39,117 --> 04:20:43,498
a deeply fulfilling thing. Big, ridiculous question.

3926
04:20:44,658 --> 04:20:47,758
I thought you're a good person to ask. What's the point of this whole

3927
04:20:47,797 --> 04:20:54,078
thing? What's the meaning of life and our existence here on Earth?

3928
04:20:54,158 --> 04:20:57,018
- I somehow think that the universe

3929
04:20:58,478 --> 04:21:02,277
has a big story to tell, or it's telling a big story the

3930
04:21:02,318 --> 04:21:05,457
whole time, and our consciousness is part of that bigger

3931
04:21:05,537 --> 04:21:13,938
story. So the consciousness of the whole of the universe, the big, the huge story

3932
04:21:14,797 --> 04:21:18,697
is something that is probably the meaning of life, or the

3933
04:21:18,758 --> 04:21:21,717
meaning of life, of our individual life, is to understand that

3934
04:21:21,758 --> 04:21:25,637
story. And that is something, for example, that I understood quite well

3935
04:21:25,678 --> 04:21:32,558
on LSD when I walked in the mountains about a month ago. Because the mountains,

3936
04:21:32,678 --> 04:21:36,658
they actually, you know, take you quite high up into the atmosphere, and they are made

3937
04:21:36,697 --> 04:21:40,098
of all kinds of minerals. So they

3938
04:21:40,158 --> 04:21:43,978
are receiving cosmic energy that comes, you know, that

3939
04:21:44,018 --> 04:21:52,018
hits our planet. And walking up there, I guess if you're on LSD,

3940
04:21:52,058 --> 04:21:55,717
you're more open somehow because you're not closing with your

3941
04:21:55,858 --> 04:21:58,158
default mode network that,

3942
04:21:59,037 --> 04:22:02,717
you know, this is the tree and this is the path and this is the mountain,

3943
04:22:02,777 --> 04:22:06,318
and now it's 2:00 and I have to go back, and the rain.

3944
04:22:06,338 --> 04:22:13,047
Like, you're more open so you're more, like, perceiving. I...

3945
04:22:13,078 --> 04:22:16,988
That's at least the impression I had. And I couldn't

3946
04:22:17,018 --> 04:22:20,707
put it in words what exactly I was perceiving, but I was perceiving more

3947
04:22:20,818 --> 04:22:27,250
of the bigger story. And I think that is inspiration, and I think those moments

3948
04:22:27,990 --> 04:22:33,830
bring you quite close to the meaning of life. And I wouldn't put that meaning on

3949
04:22:33,890 --> 04:22:39,570
life in words. It's an experience, and I think that

3950
04:22:40,789 --> 04:22:44,619
for me as an artist it was an important experience to make, to get close

3951
04:22:44,710 --> 04:22:47,539
to that. And, and that is

3952
04:22:50,010 --> 04:22:54,150
that is what you can achieve in each of your professions, you know?

3953
04:22:54,970 --> 04:22:58,949
Like a mathematician, he comes to that point when he, like,

3954
04:22:59,710 --> 04:23:03,590
sees more or, like, he grasps connections. And he might

3955
04:23:03,630 --> 04:23:07,570
not be able to put it into a formula yet, but if he's an

3956
04:23:07,650 --> 04:23:11,590
open person, he might be a better mathematician because he

3957
04:23:11,630 --> 04:23:14,830
can understand a bit more of the meaning of everything.

3958
04:23:15,269 --> 04:23:17,289
- Of this bigger story that's being written.

3959
04:23:17,330 --> 04:23:21,289
- Yeah. I mentioned to you my Substack which I think is

3960
04:23:21,730 --> 04:23:23,789
going to be the best Substack.

3961
04:23:23,810 --> 04:23:27,490
- Do you think it's possible it's the greatest Substack of all time in history?

3962
04:23:27,529 --> 04:23:28,600
- That's what it's going to be.

3963
04:23:28,630 --> 04:23:29,900
- It's going to be, yeah.

3964
04:23:29,970 --> 04:23:32,939
- Stoned Sapiens Substack, but something else...

3965
04:23:32,990 --> 04:23:35,010
- I just hope you actually do it.

3966
04:23:35,650 --> 04:23:37,990
- Well, you should become a subscriber.

3967
04:23:38,090 --> 04:23:39,890
- I will definitely subscribe.

3968
04:23:39,949 --> 04:23:43,830
- I really realized that there is a greater, a bigger story and it's somehow

3969
04:23:43,890 --> 04:23:47,500
interesting to try to open up. Because if we live... That's why I like to be in nature

3970
04:23:47,609 --> 04:23:51,310
also quite a lot. You get a better

3971
04:23:51,410 --> 04:23:54,850
access. We live boxed in. Walter Benjamin called us the boxed

3972
04:23:55,710 --> 04:23:59,240
human beings, like we're living in the cities, we're waking up, we're doing...

3973
04:23:59,269 --> 04:24:02,970
It's good to be, therefore it's good to be outside the

3974
04:24:03,010 --> 04:24:06,750
system. And I hope that my art can contribute to, you

3975
04:24:06,789 --> 04:24:08,470
know, freeing the brainwaves to,

3976
04:24:09,750 --> 04:24:13,689
you know, understanding a bit more. What that is, I don't know, but I think

3977
04:24:13,750 --> 04:24:16,910
the process of understanding more and connecting in different

3978
04:24:16,949 --> 04:24:23,330
ways, that is what I'm going for because I think that is the meaning of life.

3979
04:24:23,390 --> 04:24:28,510
- Well, thank you for doing that with all of your work and for inspiring us all

3980
04:24:28,550 --> 04:24:31,288
to do the same. Thank you so much for talking today.

3981
04:24:31,330 --> 04:24:34,609
- It was great. Thank you.

3982
04:24:34,689 --> 04:24:38,550
- Thanks for listening to this conversation with Norman Ohler. To support this podcast,

3983
04:24:38,590 --> 04:24:42,189
please check out our sponsors in the description and consider

3984
04:24:42,250 --> 04:24:46,070
subscribing to this channel. And now let me leave you with

3985
04:24:46,109 --> 04:24:51,869
some words from the great Terence McKenna: "Nature loves courage.

3986
04:24:53,050 --> 04:24:56,930
You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by

3987
04:24:56,990 --> 04:25:00,769
removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream

3988
04:25:01,090 --> 04:25:04,269
and the world will not grind you under; it will lift you

3989
04:25:04,390 --> 04:25:08,330
up. This is the trick. This is

3990
04:25:08,350 --> 04:25:12,070
what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who

3991
04:25:12,170 --> 04:25:15,490
really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they

3992
04:25:15,570 --> 04:25:22,449
understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is

3993
04:25:22,490 --> 04:25:29,830
done, by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering that it is in fact a

3994
04:25:29,910 --> 04:25:39,150
featherbed." Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
