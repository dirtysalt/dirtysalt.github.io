1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,019
- We all have the capacity to kill people and murder people and do other terrible

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,039
things. The question is why we don't do those things rather than why we

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,060
do those things quite often. Most men have fantasized about killing someone, about

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,320
70% in two studies, and most women as well.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,320
More than 50% of women have fantasized about killing somebody. So murder fantasies

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,600
are incredibly common.

7
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,220
- The following is a conversation with Julia Shaw, a criminal

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,380
psychologist who has written extensively on a wide

9
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,240
variety of topics that explore human nature, including

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,140
psychopathy, violent crime, psychology of evil, police

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,180
interrogation, false memory manipulation, deception detection,

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,660
and human sexuality. Her books include

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,560
Evil, about the psychology of murder and sadism, The

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,020
Memory Illusion, about false memories, Bi, about

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,960
bisexuality, and her new book that you should definitely go

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,000
order now called Green Crime, which is a study

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,620
of the dark underworld of poachers, illegal gold

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,400
miners, corporate frauds, hitmen, and all kinds of

19
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,320
other environmental criminals. Julia is a

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,960
brilliant and kindhearted person with whom I got the chance to

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,180
have many great conversations with on and off the mic. This was an honor and a

22
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,140
pleasure. This is Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:40,960
on. And now, dear friends, here's Julia Shaw. You wrote the book Evil: The Science

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,020
Behind Humanity's Dark Side. So lots of interesting topics

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,840
to cover here. Let's start with the continuum. You

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,240
described that evil is a continuum. In other words, the dark

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,140
tetrad: psychopathy, sadism, narcissism,

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,220
Machiavellianism, are a continuum of traits, not a binary zero-one

31
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,500
label of monster or non-monster. So, can you explain this continuum?

32
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,520
- Yeah. So, each trait on the Dark Tetrad, as it's called, which is the

33
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,420
four traits that are associated with dark personality traits. So, things that we

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,380
often associate with the word "evil," like sadism, which is a pleasure in

35
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,910
hurting other people. Machiavellianism, which is doing whatever it takes to get

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,900
ahead. Narcissism, which is taking too much pleasure

37
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,480
in yourself and seeing yourself as superior to

38
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,340
others. And then there's psychopathy. Psychopathic

39
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,080
personalities specifically often lack in empathy, and

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,780
it's usually characterized by a number of different traits

41
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,680
including a parasitic lifestyle, so mooching off of others. Deceptiveness,

42
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,760
lying to people, and again, that empathy dimension where you

43
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,540
are more comfortable hurting other people because you don't feel sad when other people feel

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,320
sad. Now, all of those traits: psychopathy,

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,920
sadism, Machiavellianism, and narcissism, all of them have a

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,820
scale. And so you can be low on each of those traits or you can be high on

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,800
each of those traits. And what the Dark Tetrad is, it's actually a way of classifying

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,620
people into those who might be more likely to

49
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,540
engage in risky behaviors or harmful behaviors and those who are not. And if you score

50
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,420
high on all of them, you're most likely to harm other people. But

51
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,230
each of us score somewhere. So, I might score low on sadism

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,620
but higher on narcissism. And in all of them, I'm probably

53
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,340
subclinical. And so this is the other thing we often talk about in

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,269
psychology is that there's clinical traits and clinical diagnoses,

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,130
like someone is diagnosed as having

56
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,020
narcissism. Or they're subclinical, which is you don't quite

57
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,980
meet the threshold, but you have traits that are related, and that are so important for us to

58
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,080
understand in the same context.

59
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,760
- So, early in the book, you raised the question that I think you highlight is a very

60
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,760
important question: if you could go back in time, would you

61
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,450
kill baby Hitler? This is somehow a defining question. Can you explain?

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,180
- Well, it's about whether you think that people are born evil. So the

63
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,940
question of "Would you kill baby Hitler?" is meant to be something that gets

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,930
people chatting about whether or not they think that people are born with the traits

65
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,970
that make them capable of extreme harm towards others. Or whether they think

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,160
it's socialized, whether it's something that, maybe in how people are

67
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,600
raised, sort of manifests over

68
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,520
time. With Hitler, we know from certainly psychologists who have pored

69
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,440
over his traits over time and looked at who he was over the

70
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,320
course of his life, there's always this question of, "Was he mad or bad?"

71
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,140
And the answer to "Was he mad?" Well, he certainly

72
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,820
had some characteristics that people would associate with, for

73
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,850
example, maybe sadism, with this idea that

74
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,820
he was less high on empathy is probably also showcased

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,469
in his work. But in terms of whether he was born that

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,300
way, I think the answer usually would be no. And actually, in his early life, he

77
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,280
didn't showcase quite a lot of the traits that later defined the horrors that he

78
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,780
was capable of. So would I go back in time and kill baby Hitler? The answer is

79
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,800
no because I don't think it's a straight line from baby to adult,

80
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,680
and I don't think people are born evil.

81
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,740
- So you think a large part of it is nurture versus nature,

82
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,700
the environment shaping the person to become, to

83
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,880
manifest the evil that they bring out to the world?

84
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,720
- Well, and I'd be careful with using the word evil because I think we shouldn't use it to

85
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,640
describe human beings because it most commonly "others" people. In

86
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,640
fact, I think it makes us capable of perpetrating horrendous crimes

87
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,020
against those we label evil. So for me, that word

88
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,060
is the end of a conversation. It's when we call somebody evil,

89
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,000
we say, "This person is so different from me that I don't even need

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,600
to bother trying to understand why they are capable of doing terrible things

91
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,500
because I would never do such things. I am good." And so that

92
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,220
artificial differentiation between good and evil is something that,

93
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,990
certainly with the book, I'm trying to dismantle. And that's why

94
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,680
introducing continuums for different kinds of negative traits is really important,

95
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,020
and introducing this idea that there's nothing fundamental to people

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,360
that makes them capable of great harm. We all have the

97
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,140
capacity to kill people and murder people and do other terrible things. The

98
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,020
question is, why we don't do those things rather than why we do those things

99
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,600
quite often. So I think humanizing and

100
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,650
understanding that we all have these traits is the most important thing in my book,

101
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,710
certainly.

102
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,870
- Yeah, I think a prerequisite of doing

103
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,910
evil, I see this in war a lot, is to dehumanize

104
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,130
the other. In order to be able to murder them on scale, you have to

105
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,170
reformulate the war as a fight between good and evil. And

106
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,710
the interesting thing you see with war is both sides

107
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,790
think that it's a battle of good versus evil. It almost

108
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,950
always is like that, especially at large-scale wars.

109
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,670
- That's right, and on top of dehumanization, there is also this other thing

110
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,430
called de-individuation, which is where you see yourself as part of the

111
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,450
group, and you no longer see yourself as an individual. And so, it's this

112
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,270
fight of us versus them. And so you need both of those things. You need that

113
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,810
sort of collapse of empathy for other people, the people who are on the

114
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,310
other side. And you need this idea that you can be swallowed by the

115
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,550
group, and that gives you a sense of

116
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,250
also the cloak of justice, the cloak of morality, even

117
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,729
when, you know, maybe you're on the wrong side. And that's where, I mean,

118
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,220
getting into sort of who's on the right side of each war is always a more complicated issue.

119
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,530
But certainly calling other people evil and calling the other side evil

120
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,110
and dehumanizing them is crucial to most of these kinds of fights.

121
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,140
- Yeah, you promote empathy as an important thing to do when we're trying

122
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,070
to understand each other, and then a lot of people are uncomfortable

123
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,690
with empathy when it comes to folks that we

124
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,650
traditionally label as evil. Hitler's an example. To have

125
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,650
empathy means that you're somehow dirtying yourself by

126
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,590
the evil. What's your case for empathy, even when we're talking

127
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,450
about some of the darker humans in human history?

128
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,310
- My case for empathy, or evil empathy, as I sometimes call it, so empathy for people who we

129
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,330
often call evil... Also, the title of my book is Evil, or in

130
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,300
the UK market, it's Making Evil, which is a reference to a Nietzsche quote, which is, "Thinking evil

131
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,190
is making evil." The idea being that evil is a label we place onto

132
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,470
others. There's nothing inherent to anything that makes it

133
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,810
evil. And so, I also think that we need to dismantle that and

134
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:33,590
empathize with people we call evil because if we're saying that this is the

135
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:40,869
worst kind of act or worst kind of manifestation of what somebody can be, so if

136
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,110
someone can destroy others, torture others, hurt

137
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,070
others... I work as a criminal psychologist, so I work a lot on

138
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,970
sexual abuse cases, on rape cases, on murder trials. And so,

139
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,990
in those contexts, that word evil is used all the time. So,

140
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,070
this person is evil. And if we're doing that, then we need to go, okay,

141
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,010
but what we actually want is, we don't really just want to label people. We want to

142
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,030
stop that behavior from happening, and the only way we're going to do that is if

143
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:12,070
we understand what led that person to come to that

144
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,899
situation and to engage in that behavior. And so, that's why evil empathy, I think, is

145
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,850
crucial, because ultimately what we want is to make society safer. And the

146
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,730
only way we can do that is to understand the psychological and social levers that

147
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,610
led them to engage in this behavior in the first place.

148
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,550
- On a small tangent, I get to interview a bunch of folks

149
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,870
that a large number of people consider evil. So, how would you

150
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,730
give advice about how to conduct such interviews when you're sitting in front of a world

151
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,730
leader that some millions of people consider

152
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,810
evil? Or if you're sitting in front of people that are actual,

153
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:52,490
like convicted criminals, what's the way to conduct that interview? Because to

154
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,270
me, I want to understand that human being. They also have their

155
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,030
own narrative about why they're good and why they're

156
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,950
misunderstood, and they have a story in which they're not evil and they're going to try

157
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,500
to tell that story. And some of them are exceptionally good at telling that

158
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,590
story. So, if it's for public consumption, how would you do that interview?

159
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,530
- I think it's important to speak with people whom we or who a lot of

160
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,350
people dehumanize, including myself. I mean, I also speak with people who I think

161
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,130
are or have... I know have committed terrible crimes, and I've

162
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,010
spoken to these people because, as a criminal psychologist, that's often part of my job.

163
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,380
So, what's interesting, I think, when you're speaking to people who have

164
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,140
committed really terrible crimes, or certainly who've been convicted of

165
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,890
terrible crimes, is that not only is it potentially

166
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,730
insightful because they might give you a real answer and not just a controlled

167
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:47,490
narrative about why they committed these crimes. If they

168
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,830
are either maintaining their innocence or they're more reluctant to do that, I think

169
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,910
even the narrative that they are controlling, that they're

170
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,730
being very careful with, still tells us a lot about them. So, I

171
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,650
think, certainly in my research on environmental crime as well,

172
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,350
what we see is that people use a lot of rationalization. They say things like, "Well,

173
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,150
everybody's doing it," and, "If I hadn't done this first, somebody else would have done

174
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,530
this waste crime or this other kind of crime." So there's this

175
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,570
rationalization. There's this normalization. There's this

176
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,970
diminishing of your own role and agency, and

177
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,830
that still tells us a lot about the psychology of people who commit crimes,

178
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,770
because most of us are very bad at

179
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,630
saying sorry and saying, "I messed this up, and I shouldn't have done

180
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,410
that." And instead, what our brains do is they try to make us feel better, and they

181
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,130
go, "No, you're still a good person despite this one thing." And so,

182
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,260
we try to rationalize it, we try to excuse it, we try to explain it. And there is some truth to it

183
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,200
as well, because we know the reasons why we engage in that behavior and other people

184
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,690
don't have the whole context. So, we also do have more of the whole

185
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,650
story. But on the other hand, we need to also face the fact that sometimes we

186
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,690
do terrible things, and we need to stop doing those terrible things and prevent

187
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,790
other people from doing the same.

188
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,440
- I find these pictures of World War II leaders as children

189
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,530
kind of fascinating, because it grounds you. It makes you realize

190
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:17,790
that there is a whole story there of environment, of development through their

191
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,922
childhood, through their teenage years. You just remember they're all kids.

192
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:25,842
Except Stalin. He was looking evil already when young.

193
00:12:25,882 --> 00:12:29,762
- Well, people used to not smile in photos as well. So looking at historical photos of children,

194
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:33,922
or sometimes even kids in other cultures, it's like, "Oh, why are they all so serious?"

195
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:37,872
But our creepiness radars are also way off. This is something that I've been interested in for a long time as

196
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:41,842
well, is that we have this intuitive perception of whether or

197
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:45,552
not somebody is trustworthy. And that intuitive perception, according to

198
00:12:45,622 --> 00:12:49,322
ample studies at this point, is not to be trusted. And one thing in

199
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:53,082
particular is whether or not we think someone is creepy, including children, but

200
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:56,602
usually the research is done, of course, on adult faces and with adults.

201
00:12:56,662 --> 00:13:00,622
And only recently did we even really define

202
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:04,622
what that vague feeling of creepiness is.

203
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:08,622
It has a lot to do with not following social norms. This is something

204
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:12,362
we see that transfers to other contexts, like why people are afraid of

205
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:16,021
people with severe mental illness and psychosis. If you're on

206
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:20,141
the bus or the Tube in London, and someone's talking to themselves and they're

207
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:23,922
acting in an erratic way, we know that people are more likely to keep a distance. There

208
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:27,442
There was one study where they literally had a waiting room where they also had

209
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:31,402
people with chairs, and the question was, "How many chairs would you sit away

210
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:35,402
from someone you know has a severe mental illness?" And the answer is you sit more chairs

211
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:39,012
away, and there's a physical and psychological distancing that's

212
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:42,982
happening there. And it's not because people with severe mental

213
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:47,012
illness are inherently more violent or more dangerous. That is not

214
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:50,822
actually what the research finds. It's that we perceive them as such

215
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,222
because we perceive them as

216
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:57,162
weird basically. We go, "This isn't how you're supposed to be behaving, and

217
00:13:57,262 --> 00:14:01,141
so I'm worried about this and so I'm going to keep my distance." And so

218
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:05,042
creepiness is much the same, and that's where you can totally misfire

219
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:08,762
whom you perceive as creepy just because they're not acting in the way that you

220
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:10,641
expect people to act in society.

221
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:16,462
- Well, what are the sort of concrete features that contribute to our creepiness

222
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:21,021
metric? Is that meme accurate that when the person's attractive, you're

223
00:14:21,062 --> 00:14:23,402
less likely to label them as creepy?

224
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:26,112
- It depends. If they're too attractive, it can be. So there's-

225
00:14:26,942 --> 00:14:29,071
There's, there's effects that interact there.

226
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:29,862
- That's hilarious.

227
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:33,902
- And we also don't trust people potentially who are too attractive.

228
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:37,562
But again, deviation from the norm. And so if you're

229
00:14:37,582 --> 00:14:41,312
deviating in any way, that can lead to

230
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:46,412
well, your assessment being more wrong, but also you assessing people as more

231
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:51,102
negative. And so with creepiness, the

232
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,842
main thing that bothers me as a criminal psychologist

233
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:59,202
is that tangential to creepiness is this general idea of trustworthiness

234
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:03,462
and that you can tell whether somebody is lying. And I've done research on this,

235
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:07,271
as have lots of other people, like Aldert Vrij is one of the leading researchers on

236
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:11,171
deception detection. And he has found in so

237
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:15,152
many studies that it's really hard to detect whether someone is

238
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:18,942
lying reliably, and that people, especially police

239
00:15:19,021 --> 00:15:22,922
officers, people who do investigative interviewing, they have this high

240
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:26,942
confidence level that they, because of their vast experience,

241
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:30,521
can in fact tell whether the person across from them is lying to them, this witness, the

242
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:34,252
suspect. And the answer is that, even that, if you take them into

243
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:38,021
experimental settings, they are no better than chance at detecting

244
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:41,962
lies, and yet they think they are. And so again, you get into this path

245
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,982
where you're going to miss people who are actually lying to you potentially, and

246
00:15:46,021 --> 00:15:49,822
you're going to potentially point at innocent people and say, "I think you're guilty of this

247
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:53,541
crime," and you go hard on that person in a way that might even lead to a wrongful

248
00:15:53,582 --> 00:15:54,052
conviction.

249
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:58,832
- So it's the fact that it's very difficult to detect lies and

250
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:04,521
overconfidence in policing creates a huge problem.

251
00:16:04,582 --> 00:16:08,562
- Not just policing, in relationships and in lots of other contexts as well.

252
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:12,521
I mean, a lot of jealousy is born out of uncertainty. Jealousy isn't, "I know for sure

253
00:16:12,582 --> 00:16:16,412
that you have done something that is threatening our relationship." A lot of jealousy is, "What's in

254
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:20,002
my head because I am assuming that you might be thinking or doing

255
00:16:20,382 --> 00:16:23,662
X." And that is also basically an exercise in lie

256
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:26,932
detection. And there as well, we are very bad at it.

257
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:34,102
- Is there a combination of the dark tetrad and how good you are at lying? Like,

258
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:39,861
are people with certain traits, maybe psychopathy, are better at lying than others?

259
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:43,872
- There's definitely some research to support the idea that people with psychopathy are better at lying.

260
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:47,382
There's also some research specifically on sort of faking good

261
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:51,442
in, for example, parole decisions. So when it comes up to

262
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:55,232
someone who is... There's a legal decision to be made as to whether this

263
00:16:55,242 --> 00:16:58,902
person can be released from prison or released from just detention in general.

264
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:02,922
And then the person will act in a particular way, sort

265
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:06,882
of mimic a good prisoner, mimic someone who's safe to be released into

266
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:10,790
society. And then the committee goes, "Oh, well, you know, this,

267
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,662
this person's doing great," and so they're ready to be released. And then they make the wrong

268
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:18,162
decision because that person has been faking it. So I think with psychopathy, it's a bit

269
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:21,932
complicated. There has been

270
00:17:21,962 --> 00:17:25,882
some sort of, historically as well, some concern that certain treatment for

271
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:29,572
psychopathy, especially empathy-focused treatment, makes people with

272
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,482
psychopathy more likely to fake empathy and to

273
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:37,292
weaponize it. But then there's other research which finds that if you use other

274
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,242
kinds of interventions, so like Jennifer Skeem in

275
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:45,242
California who does research on people with psychopathy who have

276
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:49,172
committed severe crimes. And she specifically creates these treatment programs that aren't

277
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:52,831
just around empathy, but they're more around almost learning the rules of society

278
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:57,212
and convincing people that actually being pro-social is a better way to get

279
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,202
what you want in life. And so there's a real need

280
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:04,612
for tailored treatments to deal with especially certain kinds of

281
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:08,121
personality traits, dark personality traits, to try and convince people

282
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:12,062
basically, actually being pro-social is the better path, rather

283
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:16,081
than just going hard on, you know, empathy and things that they don't maybe also see

284
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:17,842
as faults with themselves.

285
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:21,362
- Is there a psychological cost to empathizing with...

286
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,550
- so-called monsters? You referenced Nietzsche in the

287
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,140
book, you know, "Gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes into

288
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,990
you." If you study, quote unquote,

289
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,630
"evil" or study monsters that you may become that.

290
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,480
Is there a danger of that? I don't think so. I think that's what

291
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,370
people fear. So, a lot of the Nietzsche quotes I use as well are... Some of them I

292
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,280
like because they speak to the chapters I write about, but... and the issues I write about.

293
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,170
But some of them I also like because they are how people think about evil

294
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,890
and people who are labeled evil. And

295
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,530
I do think with gazing into the abyss and the abyss gazing back,

296
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,150
it's more of a... You're trying to find it.

297
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,130
And that's why in some ways that doesn't work actually, because it isn't a total

298
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,050
blank. It isn't the abyss. There are in fact things that you can see,

299
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,090
even, even if it's just superficially, and patterns you can recognize to help

300
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,090
you and key decision-makers, especially in legal settings, make better

301
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,070
decisions around people like this. So, when they see these patterns, they act a better

302
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,850
way. So yeah, I get asked a lot

303
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,070
as a criminal psychologist, "Do you carry the cases that you deal around

304
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,960
with you?" So, some of the cases involve, you know, huge

305
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,850
amounts of witnesses, huge amounts of potential victims, and so in these cases there are very visceral

306
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,810
victims, and so in these cases there are very visceral

307
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,910
descriptions sometimes of heinous crimes. And

308
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,730
I think that as someone who does this work, you

309
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,230
can't be someone who sees it as anything other than a puzzle.

310
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,170
So, you have to look at it and go, "Here's the different pieces of information. What I am

311
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,230
doing is pattern recognition. I'm not here to emotionally

312
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:07,090
invest in each of these victims or potential victims. That's not my role. There's therapists for

313
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,950
that. There's other people who do that work. I am here working with the police. I'm here

314
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,170
working with lawyers. I'm here looking at it more objectively

315
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,840
to see how this all fits together." And so, I think that's how

316
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,170
I engage with it. I see it as this puzzle that I'm trying to figure out. I worry

317
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,080
for my own brain that when I confront people

318
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:29,999
and see them as a puzzle, which I do. I see the beauty in

319
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,900
the puzzle. All the puzzles look beautiful to me.

320
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:37,930
I'm sometimes like a Prince Myshkin character from The Idiot

321
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,550
by Dostoevsky, where you just see... It's not the good in

322
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,750
people, but the beauty in the puzzle. And I

323
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,810
think you can lose your footing on the moral landscape if you

324
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,910
see the beauty in everything a bit too much.

325
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,810
Because, everyone is interesting. Everyone

326
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,470
is complicated. It's the classic scientist response as

327
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:04,420
well to what other people in society go, "Ooh." They go, you know, "This

328
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,970
is horrible," or, "This atrocious thing has happened," or, "This shocking,

329
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,850
existential crisis inducing thing I've just found is, you

330
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,820
know, giving me existential crisis." And scientists instead go, "Oh,

331
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,670
wow!" And you can sort of see the delight in discovery as well.

332
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:23,270
And I think sometimes scientists read as callous because we

333
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,170
enjoy this discovery of knowledge and the discovery of insights.

334
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,070
And it just feels like this little light bulb has gone off and you go, "Oh, I

335
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:34,830
understand a tiny bit more about the human experience or about the world around us." And I think

336
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,090
it must be similar. I don't know that I feel or worry that I sort

337
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,870
of become more, quote unquote, "evil." I think it's more

338
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,950
that you add this nuance, which

339
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,880
I guess sometimes can be estranging to other people. So, there's that. When you speak with

340
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,670
others, sometimes, like even when I say, "We shouldn't use the word evil," people go,

341
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,190
"No, but you have to. Does that mean you're trivializing things?" The answer is no, I'm not

342
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,130
trivializing. I'm just trying to understand. Also, sympathizing

343
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:06,110
or being empathetic towards people whom others have written off is always going to

344
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:10,050
get that response from some people. I mean, there are real questions around whom we're

345
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,930
platforming and what that has and what role we have as content creators,

346
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,580
both of us, of the people we talk about, how we cover them. I

347
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,610
often come across this in true crime work that I do, because I get asked

348
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,470
to do TV shows. I host TV shows, and I host BBC podcasts.

349
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,170
And there's always the question of sometimes people commit

350
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,140
murder to become famous. And should it be a

351
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,130
blanket ban that we don't cover those cases, or should we cover those cases but in

352
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,170
a different way, or should we anonymize the… So, it doesn't mean that

353
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,150
you should never cover that case. It just means that you need to think about it.

354
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,780
Speaking of which, you've done a lot of really great podcast shows.

355
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,799
One of them is Bad People Podcast. You co-host it. It has

356
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,420
over 100 episodes, each covering a crime.

357
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,390
What's maybe the most disturbing crime you've covered?

358
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,180
One of the most disturbing crimes that we covered on Bad People, and just to be clear,

359
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,090
Bad People, much like the title Evil, is tongue in cheek, where the idea

360
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,940
is it's people whom we refer to as bad people. And then it's always a question of

361
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,610
who are these, quote unquote, "bad people," and are we all capable of doing these terrible

362
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:22,950
things? But one of the most, certainly, problematic, dark

363
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,940
cases that we covered was the Robert Pickton case. And

364
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:30,770
the episodes are called Piggy's Palace, because that was the

365
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,790
nickname for the farm where Robert Pickton brought

366
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,359
victims whom he had kidnapped, and then he killed them, and

367
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,060
he did terrible things to their bodies. And rumors have it,

368
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,940
certainly, that he fed some of these victims to pigs. Now, one of the reasons I

369
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,850
covered that case is actually because it was influential in my own career. So,

370
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,270
Robert Pickton is one of the most famous Canadian serial killers of all

371
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,150
time. And as I was doing my undergrad

372
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,990
at Simon Fraser University in Canada, I was being taught by someone

373
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,510
called Stephen Hart. And Stephen Hart was an expert witness on the Robert Pickton

374
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:09,390
trial, and so he was keeping us abreast of some of the developments of what

375
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,130
he was covering. And I found it so interesting,

376
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,270
and I loved Stephen Hart as a person, and he seemed to have this sense of humor,

377
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,570
this gallows humor, around it all, despite being faced

378
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,480
with one of the arguably worst people in Canadian history. And

379
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,720
I thought that that was so interesting, that someone could be

380
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,642
so nice, so kind, so wonderful, and be an expert

381
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:35,592
witness for these kinds of people. And so that's one of the reasons I went into the field is

382
00:24:35,602 --> 00:24:39,502
because of this case as well. And so we had him on the show. So he came onto Bad People

383
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:40,352
and we interviewed him for it.

384
00:24:40,642 --> 00:24:46,192
- All right. And he has done, I imagine, a lot of really difficult cases.

385
00:24:46,262 --> 00:24:49,862
- Yes, he's done a lot of difficult cases, as have other researchers like

386
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:51,822
Elizabeth Loftus, who's one of the

387
00:24:52,622 --> 00:24:56,081
main founders of the area of false memory research, which is what

388
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:59,922
I also do. I do research on memory and false memory

389
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:03,922
and witness statements. And Elizabeth Loftus has

390
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,902
also been a recent expert for the Ghislaine Maxwell case. She was in the press.

391
00:25:07,962 --> 00:25:11,682
She was in the press, and so she has worked with

392
00:25:11,782 --> 00:25:15,762
lawyers to educate the court on memory in lots of

393
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:19,442
really, really controversial cases. But the way she would explain it is that

394
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:24,142
it's still her role to just train people and teach people on how memory works.

395
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:28,142
She's not there to decide whether people are guilty or innocent, but she is there

396
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:32,442
to help people distinguish between fact and fiction when it comes to how our memories work or don't.

397
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:36,312
- So what kind of person feeds their victims to pigs? What's

398
00:25:36,322 --> 00:25:38,722
interesting about that psychology?

399
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:42,642
- The psychology about Robert Pickton? I mean, he was a tricky person because I

400
00:25:42,662 --> 00:25:46,482
think he was profoundly lonely, and this is something we see with a lot of serial killers is

401
00:25:46,562 --> 00:25:49,732
that they have this loneliness, which I think

402
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:53,712
not only contributes to them committing the crimes in the first place, but

403
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,572
also allows them to get away with things because they don't have as much of a social

404
00:25:57,581 --> 00:26:01,522
network or any social network that is helping them to do what's called reality

405
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:05,152
monitoring, to understand what's true and what's not.

406
00:26:05,182 --> 00:26:09,062
And so when you see people get radicalized in their own thoughts, whether

407
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:12,572
that's in the sense of things like schizophrenia where you've got

408
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:16,722
psychosis, you've got delusions, maybe command hallucinations. That's

409
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:20,462
when you think you're hearing voices and someone is telling you that you

410
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:24,272
have to do something, usually something harmful to other people. And if you don't

411
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:28,262
follow those, you will hear those voices forever. They're profoundly distressing, and they

412
00:26:28,302 --> 00:26:32,182
are one of the aspects of schizophrenia that if you have, it does

413
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:34,922
make you more prone to violence. And so

414
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:39,622
for these kinds of cases, if you don't have someone intervening, whether that's a

415
00:26:39,662 --> 00:26:43,532
family member or a therapist saying, "How can

416
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:47,081
you tell whether this thought is real?" Maybe that thought, maybe you're not hearing that

417
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:51,011
voice, right? Maybe that aspect of what you're thinking isn't true

418
00:26:51,482 --> 00:26:55,071
and bringing you back closer to reality. You can just wander off

419
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:58,982
to whatever alternate universe that you might live in

420
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:02,922
in your head, and it's the same with radicalization in other contexts is that you see

421
00:27:02,982 --> 00:27:06,862
that people who drift more and more into a certain group that has

422
00:27:06,902 --> 00:27:10,351
certain beliefs that are maybe divorced from the evidence, divorced from

423
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:14,262
reality. You can see that people will get more extreme over

424
00:27:14,302 --> 00:27:18,101
time, and unless you have a tether that brings you back, that allows you to do

425
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:22,062
reality monitoring, it's going to be very difficult to find your way out of

426
00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:25,752
that. So with serial killers, we find this reality monitoring

427
00:27:25,842 --> 00:27:29,402
problem, and I think part of that's related to the lack of social networks that people have.

428
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:33,331
- That's fascinating. So that's one important component of serial killers. What else

429
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:36,642
can we say about the psychology? What motivates them? So if you look at some of the

430
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:40,422
famous serial killers, Ted Bundy, John Wayne

431
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:44,101
Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, is there other things we could say about their

432
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:47,622
psychology that motivates them? So interesting, the tether to

433
00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:51,402
reality. I mean, loneliness is a part of the human condition.

434
00:27:51,482 --> 00:27:59,162
It is, in fact, one of its side effects is you can get untethered. And then with

435
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:03,182
some of these brains, I guess the untethered goes to some dark place.

436
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:07,101
- The untethered goes to a dark place, and it then is

437
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:10,902
often combined with some of these other dark

438
00:28:10,942 --> 00:28:14,622
tetrad traits. So you've got someone who maybe is high on psychopathy, low on

439
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:18,642
empathy, someone who's high on sadism, someone who thinks

440
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:22,362
that it's okay to pursue your own goals. And your own goal can

441
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:26,331
be, like with Jeffrey Dahmer,

442
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:30,562
you can be wanting to create the perfect partner, which in some ways seems to be what he

443
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:34,562
was trying to do by killing people and piecing them together and sewing up a

444
00:28:34,581 --> 00:28:38,372
sort of new version. There's something in that where I can't

445
00:28:38,422 --> 00:28:42,101
help but go, "That's so sad." I don't

446
00:28:42,142 --> 00:28:45,860
go, "Oh my God, how awful." Of course it's atrocious. Of course it's

447
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:49,902
heinous, but I have this real sympathy for that,

448
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:53,522
and I think that's important for us to have, though.

449
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:57,542
And not to say, "I can't relate to this person at all," but to say,

450
00:28:57,552 --> 00:29:01,482
"That is an extreme manifestation of something I have felt, and the

451
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:04,992
difference between me engaging in that and this person engaging in that are these other

452
00:29:05,022 --> 00:29:08,252
factors." But the core is in all of us.

453
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:16,682
- Do you think all of us are capable of evil, of some of the things we label as evil?

454
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:20,732
- I think all of us are capable of doing basically the worst things we can imagine. And one of the reasons

455
00:29:20,742 --> 00:29:24,202
I think that is because you can see neighbors turning on each other, especially if you look

456
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:27,962
historically at the start of wars or big

457
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:31,612
political moments where you have people who would have called each other

458
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:35,302
friends turning each other in to the police, killing each other,

459
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:39,462
doing terrible things. So I think all it takes is to become convinced that the

460
00:29:39,502 --> 00:29:43,382
people you think are your friends are actually your enemies, whether that's just in your own

461
00:29:43,422 --> 00:29:47,322
world or in a larger political national landscape that

462
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:51,262
I don't think it takes all that much for us to be capable of doing terrible

463
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:55,142
things. But that's also why it's really important when things are good and

464
00:29:55,182 --> 00:29:58,992
when you're not at war and when you have the capacity to think deeply about important

465
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:02,682
issues, to train your mind on these

466
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:05,862
thoughts of knowing that things like loneliness can

467
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:09,722
manifest in these extreme ways, that things like

468
00:30:10,002 --> 00:30:13,922
jealousy and aggression, that they can turn into murder, that they can turn into these

469
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:17,882
horrible versions. And to then also spot the red flags

470
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:21,502
if you start going down that path. I think if we don't rehearse

471
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,622
evil, if you will, we are much more likely to engage in it,

472
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:29,742
especially in those moments where we don't have much time or energy to really think about what

473
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:30,382
we're doing.

474
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:34,734
- Yeah, I really appreciate the way you think and the way you talk about this.

475
00:30:35,573 --> 00:30:39,813
Listening to history, when I'm reading history books, I imagine myself

476
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:44,384
doing the thing I'm reading about, and I almost

477
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:49,214
always can imagine that, like when I'm being honest with myself.

478
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:53,053
- And it's important to admit that to ourselves. And research

479
00:30:53,134 --> 00:30:56,573
on murder fantasies finds that most men have fantasized about killing

480
00:30:56,634 --> 00:31:00,414
someone, about 70% in two studies. And

481
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:04,094
most women as well. More than 50% of women have fantasized about killing

482
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:08,053
somebody. So murder fantasies are incredibly common, and certainly

483
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:11,864
according to some researchers, that's a good thing. Being

484
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:15,293
able to rehearse and think through doing the most terrible

485
00:31:15,394 --> 00:31:19,374
things is a great dress rehearsal for also how we

486
00:31:19,414 --> 00:31:23,154
don't want to live our lives. And only if you are able to fully

487
00:31:23,194 --> 00:31:27,134
think through, "What would I actually be like if I was

488
00:31:27,214 --> 00:31:31,104
engaging in this? What would I be thinking? Who would I be with? What would be my...

489
00:31:31,114 --> 00:31:34,934
the group that I'm charging against this other person? You know,

490
00:31:34,974 --> 00:31:38,764
who am I there with?" As you said, like really putting yourself in the shoes of

491
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:42,714
these people who have done terrible things. That is

492
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,614
how you also realize that you do not want those consequences. And

493
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:50,494
so yeah, you maybe want to murder this person, but you don't really want to murder this

494
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:51,654
person. That's that

495
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:56,194
intuitive sort of animalistic brain coming in. But then luckily, we

496
00:31:56,234 --> 00:32:00,094
have higher reasoning that goes, actually, if you think this through, that's a pretty

497
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:03,904
terrible consequence for yourself. So the better thing to do is not to murder this

498
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:07,624
person. So I think it's adaptive to be able to

499
00:32:07,654 --> 00:32:11,573
fantasize and think about these things. Obviously, if you start getting to a point where you're

500
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:15,234
ruminating and you're going in these circles where you're constantly

501
00:32:15,274 --> 00:32:19,124
fantasizing about doing dark things, especially to a specific person, I'd

502
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:22,553
always advise seeing somebody, to talk to a psychologist, for

503
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:26,374
example. Because that then does become a risk factor for acting on those dark

504
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:30,344
fantasies. But up to that point, if it's just a fleeting thought or something that

505
00:32:30,354 --> 00:32:34,734
in one day you had these thoughts, that is totally healthy, I would say.

506
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:39,494
- And also, I think it's useful to simulate or think through what it would take

507
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:43,474
to say no in that situation.

508
00:32:43,514 --> 00:32:47,114
Meaning, once you're able to imagine yourself doing evil

509
00:32:47,214 --> 00:32:50,813
things, you have to imagine the difficult act of

510
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:56,114
resisting. A lot of people think they would resist in Nazi Germany.

511
00:32:56,134 --> 00:33:00,004
Well, most people didn't, and there's a reason for that.

512
00:33:00,214 --> 00:33:03,894
It's not easy. Same reason, I've seen this.

513
00:33:04,014 --> 00:33:07,803
If something bad is happening on a public street, most

514
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:10,864
people, it's the bystander effect. Most people just stand there and

515
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:14,724
watch. I've seen it once in my life. Yeah, this is

516
00:33:14,754 --> 00:33:19,914
humans, so it's actually you want to simulate stepping up.

517
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:23,774
- Yeah, so it's also been called the heroic imagination. Someone who has studied

518
00:33:24,514 --> 00:33:28,234
evil, quote unquote, at length is Philip Zimbardo. He did the Stanford Prison

519
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:32,124
Experiment, and that was an experiment which is... I mean, it's now been

520
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:35,514
torn apart in various ways. It was absolutely influential for

521
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:39,404
psychology. It's where participants were randomly assigned whether they

522
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:43,283
would be prisoners or guards in a mock prison experiment, and then

523
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:47,214
for a number of days, they were told to do various

524
00:33:47,254 --> 00:33:50,934
things. And it got out of control, and the guards

525
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:54,313
went way over what they were supposed to be doing, and they effectively started

526
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:59,144
pseudo-torturing some of these inmates or these

527
00:33:59,154 --> 00:34:02,974
pretend inmates. And the whole thing had to be stopped prematurely, but it was

528
00:34:02,994 --> 00:34:06,583
really fundamental in showing how just by randomly being assigned

529
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:10,574
into guard, the person in charge, or inmate, you can, within a

530
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,504
matter of days, have a completely different way of thinking about one another. And

531
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:17,734
so Philip Zimbardo has also spoken at length about evil

532
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:22,194
and that all of us are capable of it in the right circumstances, but he also

533
00:34:22,413 --> 00:34:26,373
is a big proponent of what he calls the heroic imagination.

534
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:30,274
And the heroic imagination is really what the purpose of everything I do is.

535
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:34,183
The purpose of what I do isn't just to go, "Ooh, this is curious," and to stop there. The point

536
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:38,224
is to then prevent it, and to prevent it in ourselves because that's, I think,

537
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:41,694
ultimately what has to happen. You can't do a top-down sort of government-level

538
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:46,083
approach to trying to be so tough on crime that no one will ever commit crime.

539
00:34:46,094 --> 00:34:49,974
That's impossible. But you can change, to

540
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:53,934
say it in a tacky way, the hearts and minds of individuals to recognize the

541
00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:57,714
pathways towards evil and to go, "Wait, I'm off

542
00:34:57,754 --> 00:35:01,614
track. I don't want to go this way, and I'm going to stop myself here, and here's how I can find my

543
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:05,203
way back." And so the heroic imagination is exercising

544
00:35:05,254 --> 00:35:09,004
that. I see someone on the street. How do I make sure that they're

545
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:12,794
okay? How do I not become a bystander? And actually, the bystander stuff is

546
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:16,714
interesting because there was a really famous case, the murder

547
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:20,564
of Kitty Genovese, and there were all of these both ear and

548
00:35:20,674 --> 00:35:24,474
eyewitnesses. So an ear witness is someone who just hears things, and an eyewitness is someone who

549
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:28,484
sees the crime happening, and they didn't intervene in the murder of this

550
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:32,024
woman. And so this case was often taken as this

551
00:35:32,654 --> 00:35:36,574
almost example of, "Look how terrible human beings are. We just walk by. We

552
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,604
don't care about what's happening to strangers on the streets." And actually, what's happened

553
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:44,474
since is that there's been lots of other bystander experiments, and they

554
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:48,404
have not substantiated this. So we need to be very careful

555
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:52,183
with looking at these extreme cases and going, "How horrible that this happened to this one

556
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:56,243
person," and it is. But that doesn't mean that that's always how it happens. And

557
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:00,194
so actually, what we find in bystander research is that most of the time, bystanders do

558
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:03,913
intervene. It's just when there has already been a crowd that has

559
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:07,824
accumulated, you read the room, and you assume, "Well, nobody

560
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:10,953
else has intervened yet, and so it must not be a real problem."

561
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:17,474
That desire to not stand out in a negative way is often what hinders heroism.

562
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:22,074
I mean, that's why we look at heroes, people who especially risk their own

563
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:24,114
lives to save others, especially strangers.

564
00:36:25,134 --> 00:36:29,094
We see them with a sort of respect that nobody else gets, and that's because we recognize that we might not be capable of that.

565
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:33,294
and that's because we recognize that we might not be capable of

566
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:36,814
that. If I saw a stranger drowning in a river, would I

567
00:36:37,034 --> 00:36:40,214
really risk my life jumping in the river to maybe save

568
00:36:40,234 --> 00:36:44,210
them? I think that's a big question mark. And so

569
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,029
when people do that, especially when people almost have this inherent

570
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:53,049
reaction that they just jump in, they just go for it, that is something that is a

571
00:36:53,089 --> 00:36:57,049
really admirable quality that we as humans do celebrate, and we should. And I

572
00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:02,250
think often we should celebrate those incidents more and not

573
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:06,140
the, you know, the bystander moments where we didn't intervene. We should be

574
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:07,770
normalizing intervening.

575
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,810
- And again, this idea of heroic imagination,

576
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:15,730
actually simulating, imagining yourself standing up and saving the

577
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,730
person when a crowd is watching, they're drowning, to be the one that dives in, tries

578
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,029
to help. You mentioned

579
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,830
70% of men and some large percentage of women fantasize about murder,

580
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:37,350
and I also read that you wrote that recidivism for homicide is only 1 to 3%.

581
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:43,330
So that raises the question, why do people commit murder?

582
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,470
- Murder is a really interesting crime

583
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:50,310
because most of the time it's perpetrated for reasons that we

584
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:57,149
don't like as a society. So as a person who talks a lot to the news and also to

585
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,910
producers who are trying to make true crime shows, who don't necessarily have a

586
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,290
deep understanding of psychology, let's just say, and who come at you with myths

587
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,310
where you go, "Oh, no, we're not, we're not going to talk about that. We're not going to talk about whether or not the

588
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:14,330
mom is to blame for this person killing somebody." I hate that. That's one of

589
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:18,290
my least favorite sort of... The trauma narrative of all people

590
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,319
who do terrible things must have had a terrible childhood, I think is really problematic.

591
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:26,210
What really happens in murder most of the time, which is not what you see on TV because it's

592
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,190
really boring, is it's a fight that gets out of control. And if you

593
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,990
look at the real reasons stated, it's things like, "This person

594
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:37,810
owed me $4 and so I killed him. This person

595
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,560
stole my bike. This person owed me..." It's these really

596
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:45,450
stupid reasons, and it is just this bad decision in the

597
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,149
moment, an overreaction to a fight, to an argument,

598
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,109
and it wasn't planned. It's not some psychopath sharpening

599
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,790
their knives, waiting for months to try and kill this person. And we don't like

600
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,609
that because there's something called the victimization gap, which is that

601
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,600
the impact of this extreme situation on the

602
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:07,600
perpetrator, there's a huge gap between that and the impact on the victim and

603
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:10,649
their family. So the victim loses a life, whereas the

604
00:39:10,689 --> 00:39:14,629
perpetrator, sure, they get imprisoned, but that... At best, right? If you

605
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,990
will, in terms of justice. But they don't have the same kinds of

606
00:39:18,029 --> 00:39:21,390
consequences, and we don't like that. We like things that have extreme

607
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,390
consequences to have extreme reasons. And so that's why I think there's

608
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:29,290
this real desire to show serial killers and to

609
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,319
show people who are, in fact, planning murders for a really long time and

610
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,689
then engage in them, rather than this fight that goes out of

611
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,710
control, or someone drink driving, or someone who

612
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,620
is... I mean, unfortunately, intimate partner homicide is also one of those

613
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:48,390
situations that is common, one of the top four reasons for murder as

614
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:52,210
well. But that's not the

615
00:39:52,629 --> 00:39:56,290
almost glamorized version that we see of murder online or that we

616
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,049
see in the news. So I think it's always important to talk about murder

617
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,310
as something that is rarely inherent to an

618
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:07,129
individual. Very few people want to murder. They might

619
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:10,680
fantasize about it, but they don't want to go through with it. And very few people who do engage in

620
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,629
murder wanted to do it in that instance, never mind again.

621
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,910
I think in general, we have the way that we look at lots of crimes upside

622
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,750
down. So we put murderers in prison for a really long time

623
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:26,720
because we think that that's justice, which is, sure, that's one version where

624
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,710
it's, you know, an eye for an eye kind of. You know, life for life.

625
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,710
There's obviously the more extreme version of that, which is the death penalty, which I don't adhere to, but

626
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,529
I could see the rationalization of, well, you stole somebody else's life, so you don't

627
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:42,029
deserve to have one. But there's also the other side, which is, if we're looking at

628
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:45,939
prevention, murder is really... Like, they're not going to...

629
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,850
People aren't going to go out and murder again. So that is... That's a really low

630
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,450
risk in terms of recidivism, actually. And high risk are things like

631
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,290
fraud and elder abuse and sexual violence. And so

632
00:40:57,549 --> 00:41:00,490
in some ways, sometimes our sanctions are upside down in terms

633
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:04,549
of how we can actually make society safer, and they're

634
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:08,490
in line more just with how we perceive justice to work. So there's, there's

635
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:12,069
big fundamental questions about how we organize our justice systems and what we want them to be

636
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:13,250
for.

637
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,490
- Can you just linger on that a bit? So how should we think

638
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,350
about everything you just described for

639
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:24,290
how our criminal justice system forgives? If they are very

640
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,710
unlikely to murder again, how would you reform the criminal justice system?

641
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,730
- I think forgiveness is up to the victims'

642
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,140
families, and quite often, when you speak with victims'

643
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:38,799
families, there is this divide where you have

644
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,710
some who are much more keen on something called restorative justice,

645
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,649
which is where they... what they want is for the person to apologize, the

646
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,080
perpetrator to apologize, to explain how it happened.

647
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:54,450
Also, quite often, I mean, you look at some of the other consequences in the other

648
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,370
context, it's sort of, like, teenage boys who are part of gangs, for example, is the

649
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,370
other context. And it's a teenage boy killing another teenage boy. These

650
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,170
are kids, and the parents of a teenage boy understand

651
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,629
that. This isn't... they don't think of this other perpetrator

652
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:14,430
as this grown man who has... I don't know. I think we think of it as

653
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:19,569
this fight between the parents of both teenage boys in that

654
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:23,509
case, but really, often what parents want is to just understand

655
00:42:23,529 --> 00:42:27,430
how this could happen and, in some ways, to allow the other teenage boy to still have a

656
00:42:27,509 --> 00:42:31,430
life and to not steal theirs as well, or his as well. So

657
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,430
there's that restorative justice model where forgiveness, I think, belongs to the

658
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:39,160
families. Some families, of course, want the most extreme punishment. That's

659
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:43,170
also... I can understand how that would be a response that's triggered if

660
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,770
you've suffered a severe loss. But if we're looking to make society

661
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,660
safer, putting people who've killed in prison is not

662
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,690
actually the answer, right? Because if we want society to

663
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:58,529
be safer, it should be based purely on what is most likely to deter

664
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,549
crime and who is most likely to engage in it, and

665
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:05,230
that's where I think we've got it upside down.

666
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,089
- If I could just stick to The Bad People Podcast, there's an episode on

667
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,680
incels called Black Pill, Are Incels Dangerous? So are they

668
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,730
dangerous? What's the psychology of incels?

669
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:19,290
- So that episode was all about what it means to

670
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:22,890
espouse certain kinds of views, especially about women,

671
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,750
and what it means to be in an environment that

672
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,609
is fueling the fire of... well, hatred of

673
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,790
gender. And so, and the idea of entitlement. So I think

674
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,830
one thing that we see often in crimes, of all sorts actually,

675
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,630
is this sense of entitlement that drives the perception that I'm

676
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:50,970
allowed to engage in X because of something else. And I deserve to have a life that

677
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:54,930
looks like this, but I don't, and so I'm going to go take it, or I'm going to

678
00:43:55,009 --> 00:44:00,109
go do something to show my dissatisfaction in life. And so if you think that

679
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,680
all men deserve to have a happy life, sort of a Disney version

680
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,790
with a woman at home who's taking care of the kids, and it's the sort of white

681
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,830
picket fence ideal that we've been sold. We have been told that that is what we should

682
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,810
have. Like, I understand where it comes from, and

683
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,950
the question though, is, are we entitled to that or is that the idea

684
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,630
that that's something we should strive towards? And I think the answer is no, nobody's

685
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,400
entitled to a good life. I would like to see freedoms and

686
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:33,190
rights manifest in such a way that everyone is able to achieve

687
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:37,069
the kind of life that they themselves want. But you're not

688
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:40,970
entitled to it. And so that's where I think it can get a bit crossed and we can be

689
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:44,870
sold these lies that are basically impossible for

690
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,790
everybody in society to achieve. And understandably

691
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,650
people get angry, and if you're angry and if you feel entitled and if you're in

692
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,290
this group where everyone else is thinking the same way as you, yeah, that can make you

693
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:56,700
dangerous.

694
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:02,180
- And the internet gives you a mechanism to be your worst self.

695
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,120
- And it can reinforce that worst self. You see other people saying, "Yeah, I feel the

696
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,430
same way. Do you want me to help you?"

697
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,069
- Oh, the internet.

698
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,089
So, one more episode, you interviewed the lady Cecilia, who got Tinder

699
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:21,370
swindled. Can you tell what happened with the Tinder swindle situation?

700
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,960
- So, the Tinder Swindler, that was a person who pretended

701
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,790
on Tinder to be a rich guy who had this lavish

702
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:32,069
lifestyle, and he would match with women on

703
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,089
Tinder, and very quickly love-bomb them. So he would send

704
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:39,569
them all kinds of messages and immediately start

705
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,370
being very emotional, very sharing, pretend that he's

706
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,990
messaging from his private jet, or actually message from his private jet, but pretend

707
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:51,910
that he's in love with this person very quickly. And then

708
00:45:52,009 --> 00:45:59,470
he would invite women, in this case Cecilia, to very expensive, luxurious dates. So

709
00:45:59,509 --> 00:46:03,410
he would whisk them away to Paris, or he would show them

710
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,120
his private jet, or he would take them to a really expensive restaurant, almost to prove that

711
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:09,970
he, in fact, is this really wealthy guy.

712
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:13,990
And he would simultaneously be building up the story of

713
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:17,970
a future together. You see this in people who

714
00:46:18,029 --> 00:46:21,770
are really problematic in relationships in a lot of ways. I mean, this is not just in

715
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,779
scams or in criminal settings, but problematic relationship

716
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:29,620
styles often involve someone who is creating this

717
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:34,240
idea of a future together that you can just see it now. You know,

718
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:38,220
"Our kids in the garden running around. You're the only one for me."

719
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,310
That kind of language, like almost planning your wedding on the third date.

720
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,630
That kind of thing is what he would weaponize. And she,

721
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:49,589
Cecilia, was looking for love. She wanted all of those

722
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,290
things, and so it worked really well. He ended up doing is

723
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:57,230
defrauding her of lots of money, and she ended up taking

724
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,210
out loans, and her family were giving her money to help what he

725
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:05,120
was saying was this critical situation. Very classic fraud.

726
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:08,710
It's a critical situation where he was being followed, he was under attack, and he

727
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,009
needed her to pay for some things. He needed her to pay for some flights,

728
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:16,410
until she ran out of money. And then she realized that

729
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:20,090
this all was a big fraud. This was a love scam. So,

730
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:24,230
the reason that we spoke with her is partly to show

731
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:28,109
how it can happen, and I think it's really important to remind

732
00:47:28,149 --> 00:47:31,170
people that this is something everybody is capable of

733
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:35,250
believing. Fraud works because people

734
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:39,069
know what we want to hear, and they tell us the things we want to hear. And

735
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,069
so, I think all of us, there's a tailored version of fraud that could appeal to

736
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:46,390
basically everybody if they have enough information about you.

737
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:50,310
- Yeah, and by the way now, in modern day, AI could probably better and

738
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,270
better do that kind of thing. Do the tailored

739
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:57,630
version of the story that you want to believe,

740
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:02,859
and love is a topic on which that would be especially effective.

741
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,640
- Yeah, because you're playing with people's emotions, and you know that they're vulnerable in that

742
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:11,210
way. And most people want to be loved and want to love, and

743
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,569
so it's a really manipulative way

744
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:20,670
in, and I think it's really horrible, but it's also something that we all

745
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:25,350
almost underestimate. So we think, "I would identify fraud. I would

746
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:29,310
know if someone was trying to scam me of money," until it happens to us, and then we go, "Oh,

747
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:33,330
wait. That did just happen." And then we get really embarrassed.

748
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,990
And so I think talking about it is really important, and seeing it as not this thing that

749
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:40,970
happens to dumb people, because that is sometimes how it's framed. It's like, "Oh, such

750
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:42,930
an idiot." "She was so gullible."

751
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,710
Was she? Or was she just a nice person who wanted to believe that this

752
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:50,170
person was capable of loving her, which I would hope we all are.

753
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,970
- Yeah, and I hope she and others that fall victim to that kind of thing

754
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,850
don't become cynical and keep trying.

755
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,142
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right, that's right.

756
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:00,902
- Those kinds of things can really destroy your

757
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:05,942
ability to be vulnerable to the world. But, I mean, it sounds like this same

758
00:49:05,982 --> 00:49:09,542
kind of thing is just commonplace in all kinds of relationships. That's the puzzle

759
00:49:09,662 --> 00:49:13,062
that it could be a... If you find yourself inside of a toxic

760
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:17,082
relationship with a, quote, "Love bombing," It could be a lot of

761
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:21,071
manipulative, fraud type of things, right, inside a relationship.

762
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:22,022
...in this spectrum.

763
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,821
- Well, and coercive control is becoming more of an issue, where that's when somebody,

764
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:29,502
for example, in a relationship takes control of the finances, and that's

765
00:49:29,622 --> 00:49:33,132
often a man in a relationship. That's sort of traditionally because it

766
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:37,062
falls often along these gender lines. But the problem is if that

767
00:49:37,082 --> 00:49:40,942
person then starts to weaponize the fact that they're controlling the finances

768
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:44,922
and starts using words like, "I'm going to give you your allowance," instead

769
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:48,761
of going, "You've paid as much into this as I have, and so this is our shared

770
00:49:48,801 --> 00:49:52,392
money," and starts using that and controlling things and

771
00:49:52,402 --> 00:49:56,321
controlling how the other person lives in that relationship, that's when

772
00:49:56,362 --> 00:50:00,261
you get into things that are called coercive control. And things like jealousy

773
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:00,812
can also be used in that way.

774
00:50:01,162 --> 00:50:04,971
- Is there any way out of that? Maybe the jealousy

775
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:09,741
study, or is this a vicious downward spiral whenever there's any

776
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:12,531
kind of signs like this that means you're

777
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:17,341
screwed, get out? Or is this just the puzzle of the human

778
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:21,882
condition and humans getting together and having to solve that puzzle?

779
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:25,902
- I have non-traditional views on jealousy. I'm not a jealousy

780
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:30,801
researcher, but I have done some research on sexuality and I

781
00:50:31,922 --> 00:50:35,642
personally think that jealousy is basically always a red

782
00:50:35,662 --> 00:50:39,422
flag. Because what it means is that the person who is jealous isn't

783
00:50:39,432 --> 00:50:43,321
secure in the relationship, and the reason that they're not secure in the relationship

784
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:47,292
is either because the relationship is wrong for them or because they are insecure

785
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:51,292
in themselves. And I don't think it is a sign of love. I don't think it is a sign of,

786
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:55,102
you know, you want to protect your mate. I think it is mostly control, and it's

787
00:50:55,122 --> 00:50:58,982
the desire to control and to possess. And jealousy, we know, is a precursor

788
00:50:58,991 --> 00:51:02,962
to intimate partner violence almost always. As in, not all jealousy leads

789
00:51:02,982 --> 00:51:06,890
to violence, of course, but all violence is the jealousy as a precursor.

790
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:10,761
And quite a lot of that is imagined things that the partner is doing, not even

791
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:14,821
based on reality. Then we go back to our deception detection research,

792
00:51:14,862 --> 00:51:18,642
where we're bad at telling whether someone's lying or not. And so if you're

793
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:22,662
basing how you're interacting with that person on a faulty lie detector, you're

794
00:51:22,682 --> 00:51:26,241
going to make bad decisions. So, the research also bears out that

795
00:51:26,602 --> 00:51:27,962
most people are really bad at monogamy.

796
00:51:28,841 --> 00:51:32,721
So, most people either have cheated on a significant other, maybe not their current

797
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:35,962
significant other, but a significant other or have cheated multiple

798
00:51:35,982 --> 00:51:40,422
times, and that's just consistently found in the research.

799
00:51:40,582 --> 00:51:42,622
- So, maybe there's justification to be jealous?

800
00:51:43,042 --> 00:51:46,462
- I think it's the other way around. I think monogamy is setting us up to fail.

801
00:51:46,482 --> 00:51:49,971
So, I think monogamy is a social construct. That's a nice idea for some

802
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:53,942
people, and I think that at least based on the research on how people actually

803
00:51:53,962 --> 00:51:57,632
behave, they're not actually behaving in a monogamous way. If you're cheating on your

804
00:51:57,642 --> 00:52:01,582
partner, that is not monogamy. That is polyamory, potentially. So, the

805
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:08,261
love of multiple people. And it's lying, and it's... It doesn't have to be that

806
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:12,102
way. So, I'm polyamorous, and I believe that you can love

807
00:52:12,142 --> 00:52:16,091
multiple people. I don't know that everyone is always going to meet lots of people at the same time that they're going

808
00:52:16,102 --> 00:52:19,962
to love. But I think that there's been a move towards more

809
00:52:20,082 --> 00:52:24,062
people embracing open relationships and non-traditional relationship structures, and

810
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:27,801
I think that is healthy to at least have as an

811
00:52:27,902 --> 00:52:31,232
option. I think the idea that there's just one size fits all for

812
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:35,082
relationships is really harmful to a lot of people, and it

813
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:36,801
just doesn't really work for everybody.

814
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:40,741
- Well, if you could just focus in on one component, it seems to me one of the

815
00:52:40,781 --> 00:52:47,091
problems is honesty as a hard requirement and good communication

816
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:51,832
is another hard requirement, because that feels like

817
00:52:52,522 --> 00:52:56,711
the prerequisites for avoiding all these problems.

818
00:52:56,721 --> 00:53:00,642
- And I guess with jealousy, what I'm thinking of is actually not an instance

819
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:01,341
of jealousy,

820
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:01,452
- Oh, yeah

821
00:53:01,452 --> 00:53:05,321
- ...so where you have a feeling of, "I feel left out," or, "I feel-"

822
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:09,362
It's more that sort of persistent feeling of, "I am a jealous person."

823
00:53:09,462 --> 00:53:13,402
And that's where I would say that is usually a red flag. And you're right.

824
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:17,181
It might... It's a red flag partly because it means the person's probably bad at communicating, or you

825
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:20,091
are as a couple. It's not necessarily just the jealous-

826
00:53:20,102 --> 00:53:20,131
- Together

827
00:53:20,142 --> 00:53:21,281
- ...person's fault.

828
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:25,112
It's just that there's something happening in this dynamic that is bad

829
00:53:25,142 --> 00:53:29,131
psychologically, and that should be addressed, or maybe it's not

830
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:30,301
the right relationship.

831
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:34,232
- So, the fact that a lot of people cheat, does that mean every

832
00:53:34,322 --> 00:53:38,172
single person that cheated? Does that mean they're probably not

833
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:41,942
going to be good at monogamy? I guess if you can just analyze all

834
00:53:41,982 --> 00:53:45,261
of human civilization as it stands and give advice that's

835
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,142
definitively true for everyone. Not-

836
00:53:48,162 --> 00:53:50,082
- That's exactly what psychologists do all the time. Yeah.

837
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:50,261
- Okay. Generalize.

838
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:52,062
- We make sweeping statements.

839
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:55,832
- This is great. No, I think it's really interesting because I see all those things as

840
00:53:55,862 --> 00:53:59,781
romantic, choosing not to cheat, choosing to dedicate yourself fully

841
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:03,622
to another person. I mean, it's all just romantic, and then some

842
00:54:03,682 --> 00:54:07,412
people do cheat, and your heart is broken. You write a song about it, and

843
00:54:07,462 --> 00:54:11,442
then you move on. You try to repair yourself and be vulnerable

844
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:13,122
to another human being and all that.

845
00:54:13,162 --> 00:54:17,122
- But why deny yourself the beautiful spectrum of human experience? It's like eating one

846
00:54:17,162 --> 00:54:20,982
meal for the rest of your life. Like, why? You don't have to do that. You could

847
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:26,872
just... You can have lots of beautiful people around and...

848
00:54:26,902 --> 00:54:30,841
- Well, for me, actually, focusing on a single thing, you get to

849
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:32,162
explore. You mentioned puzzle.

850
00:54:33,022 --> 00:54:36,761
Over time, you get to see the nuance, like the beauty of the puzzle. You

851
00:54:36,801 --> 00:54:40,442
realize it's an infinitely long project to really understand another human

852
00:54:40,482 --> 00:54:43,172
being. And so, if you focus, you don't get

853
00:54:43,202 --> 00:54:47,192
distracted. So, that applies. I'm a person when I

854
00:54:47,221 --> 00:54:51,182
find a meal I really like, I'll stick to it for a long time. I'm definitely a

855
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:55,112
monogamy person, I think. But that also could be a component of where I

856
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:58,962
grew up. You know, there's a certain cultural upbringing, and maybe

857
00:54:59,002 --> 00:55:00,422
my brain is not allowing...

858
00:55:01,322 --> 00:55:05,102
- ...myself certain possibilities, you know? I think it's more

859
00:55:05,662 --> 00:55:09,422
that I want people to feel like they have a choice, and that's the

860
00:55:09,462 --> 00:55:13,332
important thing. And I think all we see is monogamy everywhere, all the time, and it's just

861
00:55:13,382 --> 00:55:16,992
one version of how we can live our lives, and I think it's not the only. And I think that

862
00:55:17,942 --> 00:55:21,862
having conversations with your partner as well, especially early. It's harder to bring this up later

863
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:25,862
on, but to have it early and say, you know, "How do you actually want to structure

864
00:55:25,902 --> 00:55:29,762
your life?" And I think, "How do you want to restructure your relationship?" is part of that.

865
00:55:29,822 --> 00:55:33,722
And especially if you're going to commit yourself to one person, one primary person,

866
00:55:33,782 --> 00:55:37,762
or one exclusive person, that's part of it. And I think

867
00:55:37,862 --> 00:55:41,602
then you also, you know, don't have to lie to each other if you do

868
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:45,522
cheat. Or you can talk about it in a different way if you feel like there's, you know,

869
00:55:45,562 --> 00:55:49,482
certain capacity to be honest about whom you're attracted to

870
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:51,862
and how that might impact your life more generally.

871
00:55:52,802 --> 00:55:56,542
- So, how difficult is polyamory? I think a lot of people would be curious about that kind of

872
00:55:56,602 --> 00:56:00,662
stuff. Does jealousy come up? Is it difficult to navigate?

873
00:56:00,722 --> 00:56:02,902
- It can be. I mean, all relationships can be difficult to navigate.

874
00:56:02,922 --> 00:56:03,502
- Sure.

875
00:56:03,522 --> 00:56:07,442
- I think it's the same. And the same respect, so if you're going in because you're

876
00:56:07,462 --> 00:56:10,002
trying to fix something about yourself, you're going to have a hard time.

877
00:56:10,042 --> 00:56:10,152
- Hmm.

878
00:56:10,182 --> 00:56:14,022
- Much like if you're dating a single person. If you're trying to fix something, and this is going to be

879
00:56:14,062 --> 00:56:18,022
the solution to the thing that you feel is broken about yourself, it's going to be

880
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:21,262
hard. But if you're going in, coming from a good place, and you're

881
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:24,822
going, you know, "I want to be open, and I want to connect with people, and I want to love

882
00:56:24,922 --> 00:56:27,952
people or a person," then you're going to have a better time.

883
00:56:28,502 --> 00:56:32,182
- What's the perfect polyamorous relationship look like? Can you really

884
00:56:32,262 --> 00:56:33,922
love multiple people deeply?

885
00:56:34,562 --> 00:56:37,902
- I think so. You can love people in different ways. Also, you can love lots of people deeply, I think.

886
00:56:37,922 --> 00:56:42,542
And I think, again, it's... So, research on bisexuality, so I'm

887
00:56:42,582 --> 00:56:46,542
bi, has also found that people who are bi are more likely

888
00:56:46,642 --> 00:56:50,622
to be in non-traditional relationships.

889
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:54,222
And one of the reasons for that is probably also because we constantly get asked to justify our

890
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:58,082
sexuality as well. And so if constantly you're being asked if

891
00:56:58,142 --> 00:57:02,062
one person's enough for you, if one gender's enough for you if you're in a relationship with one

892
00:57:02,162 --> 00:57:05,892
person, for example, you know, if I'm in a relationship with a man, do you miss

893
00:57:05,942 --> 00:57:09,402
women? And it's like, I don't ask you that if you're in a relationship with a woman.

894
00:57:09,501 --> 00:57:13,422
Do you miss women? Like, you probably do. But that's just

895
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:17,502
other women than your partner. It has nothing to do with being bi. And so I

896
00:57:17,542 --> 00:57:18,522
think there's this

897
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:23,082
constant barrage of questions of what does it mean? Is it real? How do you

898
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:25,742
choose? What does a relationship look like? Do you constantly want threesomes?

899
00:57:25,782 --> 00:57:29,662
There's this constant hypersexualization also, especially of

900
00:57:29,802 --> 00:57:33,522
women that we find in the research that can also lead to really negative outcomes

901
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:37,252
for mental health and for things like risk of sexual violence. But on the other

902
00:57:37,362 --> 00:57:41,252
hand, you've got bisexual people themselves saying, "Yeah, but I feel like I

903
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:45,112
also have this superpower that I can love more widely, and gender doesn't

904
00:57:45,122 --> 00:57:49,052
really matter in terms of whom I'm capable of loving." And so relationship

905
00:57:49,142 --> 00:57:52,862
structures almost come with that conversation. It's not that

906
00:57:53,362 --> 00:57:57,212
we need to be non-monogamous or that we need to be in these kinds of relationships.

907
00:57:57,242 --> 00:58:00,842
It's more that I think if you've engaged so deeply with your sexuality partly

908
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:04,552
'cause society's forced you to, then you're also going to be thinking about relationship

909
00:58:04,602 --> 00:58:06,772
structures more generally and going, "Actually, I'm going to choose this one."

910
00:58:06,842 --> 00:58:10,562
- Yeah, that's interesting. I mean, your sexual preferences and

911
00:58:10,622 --> 00:58:13,102
relationship structure preferences.

912
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:18,042
Some of the choice has to do with how society's going to respond to it. So if you have

913
00:58:18,102 --> 00:58:25,222
to explain it every time you go to a party, you might maybe not want to do that

914
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:27,942
or talk about it or at least be open about it.

915
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:32,922
Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of annoying conversations you have to do if you're

916
00:58:32,962 --> 00:58:36,772
polyamorous. Like, some of which you've mentioned. And yes, there are effects of

917
00:58:36,822 --> 00:58:42,362
like over-sexualizing the people involved. Yeah.

918
00:58:42,382 --> 00:58:46,322
- Or thinking they're lying. So with men... I wrote a book called Bi: The Hidden Culture,

919
00:58:46,342 --> 00:58:50,162
History, and Science of Bisexuality, and I did that after I created a

920
00:58:50,182 --> 00:58:53,982
bisexual research group. So, I wasn't a sexuality researcher, but as a bi

921
00:58:54,082 --> 00:58:57,912
person and a scientist, I was interested in the science of bisexuality,

922
00:58:57,982 --> 00:59:01,802
and I couldn't really find it. It was really hard to figure out what

923
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:06,102
people were actually learning about bisexual people in

924
00:59:06,642 --> 00:59:09,162
comparison to other kinds of queer people.

925
00:59:10,062 --> 00:59:14,002
And one of the things I found is that the terms that are used are not necessarily bi.

926
00:59:14,042 --> 00:59:17,862
And so it could be things like plurisexual. So, if you type into Google

927
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:21,732
Scholar the word bisexual, you're going to get a lot of confusing things also because

928
00:59:21,802 --> 00:59:25,742
bisexual is used for, like, two sexes where you have multiple sex or you can change,

929
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,962
and so they're bisexual.

930
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:28,422
- Right.

931
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:32,322
- Yeah, which is different entirely. And so I think partly

932
00:59:32,422 --> 00:59:35,782
out of that, researchers started using words like plurisexual, and

933
00:59:35,862 --> 00:59:39,841
omnisexual is another one. And so if you're looking for research on this, plurisexual

934
00:59:39,882 --> 00:59:41,211
is probably the word. But

935
00:59:41,262 --> 00:59:42,582
- What does omnisexual mean?

936
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:44,122
- It's just the same. It's just another-

937
00:59:44,182 --> 00:59:44,332
- Okay. Got it.

938
00:59:44,362 --> 00:59:47,362
- another word where it's all. Sometimes pansexual is also

939
00:59:47,502 --> 00:59:52,372
used. And again, the idea being that it's all genders.

940
00:59:52,382 --> 01:00:00,062
- So how should we think about bisexuality? Is it fluid, like

941
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:03,902
day to day, month to month, year to year fluid who you're attracted

942
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:07,582
to? Or is it at the same time have the capacity to be attracted to

943
01:00:07,622 --> 01:00:12,122
anyone or attracted to everyone? What's the right way to think about it?

944
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:16,022
- I think the right way to think about it is that I'm not attracted to most people, but

945
01:00:16,062 --> 01:00:19,912
I can be attracted to people regardless of gender, much like you're probably not

946
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:23,642
probably not attracted to most people, but you are attracted to people

947
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:27,422
of a certain gender, maybe. And so that's... It's the same as being heterosexual in terms

948
01:00:27,482 --> 01:00:31,362
of potentially my pool of people whom I might be interested in. It's

949
01:00:31,422 --> 01:00:33,532
just that the gender is irrelevant.

950
01:00:33,582 --> 01:00:37,222
- What's the biggest thing that people misunderstand about bisexuality?

951
01:00:37,262 --> 01:00:40,662
- The biggest thing that researchers find people misunderstand about

952
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:44,392
bisexuality is that it's a phase and that it's this

953
01:00:44,482 --> 01:00:48,202
idea that it's transient, that it's always changing, and that it's a

954
01:00:48,262 --> 01:00:51,322
stepping stone. So, I think a lot of people still see bisexuality

955
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:55,452
as on the way to Gay Town, sort of like you're,

956
01:00:55,502 --> 01:00:59,242
you're on your way, but you haven't quite committed and you're still stuck

957
01:00:59,342 --> 01:01:02,692
in expectations of society. You haven't quite let go yet, but really you're

958
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:06,682
gay. And that's especially true for men. So when you look at research

959
01:01:06,742 --> 01:01:10,622
on bisexual men, which is actually how the research started. So, I

960
01:01:10,642 --> 01:01:14,022
think now when we think of bisexuality, we think of women. And it's true that

961
01:01:14,062 --> 01:01:17,498
today twice as many women identify as bisexual as

962
01:01:17,538 --> 01:01:21,438
men. But if you look at the history of this and the research on

963
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:25,398
bisexuality over time, it was the other way around. So someone called Alfred

964
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:29,478
Kinsey was one of the first sexuality researchers in recent

965
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:33,398
history certainly, and he, after World War II, did this really big

966
01:01:33,438 --> 01:01:37,158
study of Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, it was called. He was a

967
01:01:37,238 --> 01:01:40,918
biologist himself, so he thought of taxonomies, and he was doing research on

968
01:01:41,018 --> 01:01:44,558
gall wasps, so insects. And this idea of human

969
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:47,928
sexuality was sort of thrown at him after the war because

970
01:01:47,998 --> 01:01:51,447
there's also this whole move to get people

971
01:01:51,518 --> 01:01:59,038
to, well, reproduce and to rebuild America. So sexuality was partly, and sex,

972
01:01:59,118 --> 01:02:02,907
specifically, was becoming more of an area of interest, both in terms of

973
01:02:02,938 --> 01:02:06,718
research and in terms of policy and funding. So Alfred Kinsey was

974
01:02:06,818 --> 01:02:10,598
asked, "Do you want to do a class on human

975
01:02:11,098 --> 01:02:15,038
sexual behavior?" And he was like, "I know nothing about this." So he spent about

976
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:19,078
a year just listening to students' questions about what they want to know

977
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:23,068
about sex, and he realized that

978
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:26,918
he was looking for research to try and build up this course that he

979
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:30,698
was probably going to teach, and he realized that he couldn't answer most of their

980
01:02:30,738 --> 01:02:34,158
questions because the research hadn't been done. So a lot of the questions were

981
01:02:34,198 --> 01:02:36,738
around, "What is normal?"

982
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:40,558
You know, "If I feel this during sex, is that normal? How often do people have sex?

983
01:02:40,618 --> 01:02:44,138
Should I want these? What about these fantasies? What does it mean? What if I have

984
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:48,098
homosexual fantasies? What if I engage in this kind of..." And so he was looking at all of

985
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:51,258
these questions and collating them, and then he went out and did these

986
01:02:51,658 --> 01:02:55,498
huge studies, and he interviewed thousands of people himself, but

987
01:02:55,558 --> 01:02:58,828
also had all these research assistants who were out there interviewing people in

988
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,428
America about their sexual behavior,

989
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:06,378
which, I mean, just picture the time. This is the 1940s.

990
01:03:07,078 --> 01:03:10,888
This is quite a conservative time. I mean, certainly more than we might

991
01:03:10,938 --> 01:03:13,798
expect now. And here's this researcher asking

992
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:17,738
incredibly personal questions about thousands and

993
01:03:17,778 --> 01:03:21,558
thousands and thousands of people, and he ended

994
01:03:21,618 --> 01:03:25,558
up finding, and this is one of the big findings in this book that

995
01:03:25,577 --> 01:03:28,587
he published called "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male," which was a

996
01:03:28,618 --> 01:03:32,118
best-seller for an entire year. He sold

997
01:03:32,258 --> 01:03:36,238
out auditoriums. They had to sometimes add the room next to

998
01:03:36,248 --> 01:03:39,608
the room he was in because there was so much desire

999
01:03:39,638 --> 01:03:47,178
to go to his lectures about sex that they had to connect radios to

1000
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:50,898
other halls to give people enough space to sit

1001
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:54,098
down. He was basically a rock star. And

1002
01:03:55,018 --> 01:03:58,338
again, I think this challenges the misconception we have about

1003
01:03:58,758 --> 01:04:02,028
sexuality, that we think of it as this sort of woke thing now.

1004
01:04:02,078 --> 01:04:05,558
that the rainbow flag and all this stuff is sort of this modern

1005
01:04:05,598 --> 01:04:09,307
invention almost. But this is the '40s. This was

1006
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:13,358
happening. People were going to these talks. People were having these conversations, and he

1007
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:17,268
created something called the Kinsey Scale. And so the Kinsey Scale is from

1008
01:04:17,398 --> 01:04:21,178
zero to six, and he found that it was not useful

1009
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:24,658
to apply a binary to people's sexual desires and sexual

1010
01:04:24,698 --> 01:04:28,448
orientation. It was more useful to put them on a continuum because most

1011
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:31,668
people were not exclusively homosexual or exclusively

1012
01:04:31,698 --> 01:04:35,678
heterosexual. Most people were somewhere in between. And so zero

1013
01:04:35,758 --> 01:04:39,718
was exclusively heterosexual tendencies, and six was

1014
01:04:39,778 --> 01:04:43,698
exclusively homosexual, and he would place people based on all of the things they told him

1015
01:04:44,078 --> 01:04:47,738
somewhere on the scale, and about half of men were

1016
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:52,058
somewhere in the middle, not exclusively either, and about a quarter of women.

1017
01:04:52,898 --> 01:04:54,118
Now, think about the time.

1018
01:04:54,218 --> 01:04:56,098
- It was a very conservative time.

1019
01:04:56,338 --> 01:05:00,298
- Well, and it's post-war though, so I think that mattered as well. So

1020
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:04,188
there's something called a homosocial environment, which has nothing to do with being

1021
01:05:04,218 --> 01:05:08,098
gay. That has to do with being in a situation where you are with people

1022
01:05:08,118 --> 01:05:11,598
of the same gender as you. So a homosocial environment are things like

1023
01:05:11,618 --> 01:05:14,608
prisons, where you only have men or only have women,

1024
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:19,178
war, which, at that point, they just had. And

1025
01:05:19,238 --> 01:05:22,938
so you have a lot of men who are exclusively in the company of men, and maybe looking

1026
01:05:22,998 --> 01:05:26,938
around going, "Well, now that my options are different, maybe I'm going to choose

1027
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:30,918
from this pool." Anyway, so he found that

1028
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:34,727
it was that way around, that a lot of people have these fantasies or

1029
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:38,778
actions that they've engaged in. And then there are other researchers, other male researchers,

1030
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:42,588
who found similar things, and then at some point in the '70s, it swapped, and

1031
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:46,178
it felt like maybe more people, more men were identifying as gay,

1032
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:50,058
and there were maybe fewer people who would have called themselves bi, and

1033
01:05:50,158 --> 01:05:54,138
suddenly this became a thing more for women. So I think that there's some social things

1034
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:58,098
going on. There's some research things going on that actually bi men are

1035
01:05:58,138 --> 01:05:59,878
have been studied for a long time as well.

1036
01:05:59,938 --> 01:06:03,818
- Okay, so you said a lot of interesting things. So there is a difference between

1037
01:06:03,878 --> 01:06:07,598
the truth and the socially acknowledged thing. So

1038
01:06:07,638 --> 01:06:11,898
there's social elements. I don't know, this might be anecdotal, but

1039
01:06:13,058 --> 01:06:14,118
I know a few women,

1040
01:06:15,278 --> 01:06:18,978
friends of mine, who identify as bisexual. I don't know a single

1041
01:06:20,118 --> 01:06:23,798
guy friend who identifies as bisexual. They're either gay or

1042
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:28,038
straight. So there's still a social thing going on.

1043
01:06:28,078 --> 01:06:28,378
- Definitely.

1044
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:28,878
- Right?

1045
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:33,298
- Definitely, and I think that research consistently shows that

1046
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:39,358
bisexual men are more likely to identify as, well, as gay or straight.

1047
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,228
And gay, well, it depends. So if they

1048
01:06:43,278 --> 01:06:47,178
have what we might refer to as a homosexual lifestyle, so

1049
01:06:47,238 --> 01:06:50,738
they engage in sort of going to queer parties,

1050
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:54,738
maybe go on Grindr or other gay apps, that would be much more a

1051
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:58,758
lifestyle thing, where you've embraced and you see this as part of your identity,

1052
01:06:58,898 --> 01:07:02,638
that you are part of this queer community. It's much easier to say you're gay than bi,

1053
01:07:02,698 --> 01:07:06,578
most often, also because there's queerphobia within the queer community.

1054
01:07:06,598 --> 01:07:10,588
And so you might get gay men saying to a bi man, "Oh, come on, you're...

1055
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:14,548
"I was bi once." That's a classic. "I was bi once," or

1056
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:18,058
"Come on, you're actually gay." It's the same that you get the other way around with bi

1057
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:22,098
women, is that because it's seen as performative, the

1058
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:26,088
idea being that bisexual women are doing it for attention,

1059
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:29,978
but the attention of men, specifically, that, well, they're all going to go back to men

1060
01:07:30,038 --> 01:07:33,978
anyway and they're just doing it. It's a phase. It's this thing that they're doing actually to

1061
01:07:33,998 --> 01:07:37,978
be sexy to men, not because they're actually interested in women.

1062
01:07:37,988 --> 01:07:41,598
And so there's this lesbian-bi thing going on, which is often quite

1063
01:07:41,618 --> 01:07:45,298
hostile. Not always, but often. And there's this gay male

1064
01:07:45,658 --> 01:07:49,458
bi thing going on, which is different in nature but is also potentially hostile.

1065
01:07:49,498 --> 01:07:53,278
So in both, saying you're bi can be problematic, but for men more so.

1066
01:07:53,378 --> 01:07:57,288
- Do you like the Kinsey Scale as a sort of very simple reduction

1067
01:07:57,458 --> 01:08:01,218
to... that there's a spectrum? I also saw the Klein

1068
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:05,138
Sexual Orientation Grid that adds a few parameters like who

1069
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:08,478
you're attracted to, how you're actually behaving, the fantasies you

1070
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:12,098
have, social preference, lifestyle preferences, all that kind of stuff.

1071
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:15,958
Self-identification, what you actually say publicly. All those different dimensions.

1072
01:08:16,678 --> 01:08:21,518
Or is the Kinsey Scale a pretty damn good approximation?

1073
01:08:21,578 --> 01:08:25,398
- The Kinsey Scale's a good start. And the Klein Grid, I think, is

1074
01:08:25,537 --> 01:08:32,618
much more fun in some ways. So the Klein Grid came out of research by Alfred Kinsey

1075
01:08:33,218 --> 01:08:36,718
and others like Havelock Ellis, but we won't get into him. And

1076
01:08:37,618 --> 01:08:41,587
Fritz Klein was a male researcher doing research also on sexuality. He was

1077
01:08:41,638 --> 01:08:45,078
specifically a therapist, and he was looking at people who were

1078
01:08:45,178 --> 01:08:48,917
struggling with their sexuality. And so people would show up in the

1079
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:53,037
70s and 80s in his practice, and they would say, "I'm struggling with my

1080
01:08:53,058 --> 01:08:56,908
sexuality." And he would say, "How can I help you?" And they would say things like, "I

1081
01:08:56,938 --> 01:09:00,888
wish I wasn't interested in men, and I'm a man." And he would

1082
01:09:00,938 --> 01:09:04,667
then work through what that means. Does that mean you don't want to have

1083
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:08,508
these feelings? Does that mean that you don't want to have these attractions?

1084
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:12,278
Does that mean that the implications of how your friends and family will see you that's the

1085
01:09:12,298 --> 01:09:15,438
problem? And so he created this much more complex

1086
01:09:15,478 --> 01:09:19,408
scale, which I think is really interesting for everybody to do, no matter what

1087
01:09:19,457 --> 01:09:23,058
their sexuality is. Because what it is is it gets you to think

1088
01:09:23,158 --> 01:09:27,018
about things like, yeah, your sexual identity, easy.

1089
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:30,318
Not just that, but in past, present, and

1090
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:34,658
ideal. And so if you say, "Well, I used to identify as straight.

1091
01:09:34,678 --> 01:09:38,487
Now I identify as bisexual." And then I have in my head... This doesn't mean that other

1092
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:42,468
people think this. In my head, I have an ideal, which could be straight,

1093
01:09:42,518 --> 01:09:46,478
because that's what maybe society's told us we should be. But it could also be something

1094
01:09:46,537 --> 01:09:50,098
be something else. So I've also had friends who've gone, you know, past,

1095
01:09:50,138 --> 01:09:53,898
present, straight, straight, but ideal bi. So you get into these interesting

1096
01:09:53,917 --> 01:09:57,878
dynamics where sometimes people just wish they were a different sexuality than

1097
01:09:57,898 --> 01:10:01,508
they were for other reasons. And then there's other things in

1098
01:10:01,558 --> 01:10:05,547
the, in the scale that ask about your lifestyle. So,

1099
01:10:05,558 --> 01:10:09,118
for example, if you are going to parties, queer parties, if you have queer

1100
01:10:09,158 --> 01:10:12,978
friends, then you might have a homosexual lifestyle, even if you're straight. But

1101
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:18,538
then again, it's how much lifestyle would you like? And so for me, that was a real

1102
01:10:18,578 --> 01:10:22,487
moment where I was looking at that going, "Wow, my lifestyle's really straight."

1103
01:10:22,487 --> 01:10:26,198
"And maybe I need to change this." And so he was using these attractions and

1104
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:30,218
fantasies and identities, and the past, present, ideal,

1105
01:10:30,318 --> 01:10:34,267
to help people to think through all these complicated feelings we have around

1106
01:10:34,278 --> 01:10:37,938
our sexuality, and to identify sticking points.

1107
01:10:37,978 --> 01:10:41,778
- Yeah, that's fascinating. So maybe the presumption there is if everything's

1108
01:10:41,798 --> 01:10:45,778
aligned, the fantasies, the ideal partner, the... all

1109
01:10:45,898 --> 01:10:49,298
those things, that's probably the healthiest place to be?

1110
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:52,987
- Right. And so he would look at especially the ideal and

1111
01:10:53,058 --> 01:10:56,958
the present. And if those were different, so if you said,

1112
01:10:56,968 --> 01:11:00,888
"I wish I was bi but I'm straight," or "I'm bi but I wish I was straight," or "I'm

1113
01:11:00,898 --> 01:11:04,848
homosexual and I wish I was straight," he would say, "Let's talk about that,"

1114
01:11:04,878 --> 01:11:08,538
and he'd try to work through it. And the term he used for bisexual people who were

1115
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:12,278
uncomfortable in their own sexuality was being a troubled

1116
01:11:12,298 --> 01:11:15,998
bisexual. And so I think you can... I think any

1117
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:19,658
sexuality can be troubled. I think you could be a troubled straight person, a troubled

1118
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:23,338
homosexual person, a troubled asexual person. And just thinking about

1119
01:11:23,438 --> 01:11:27,218
why and which aspects are maybe missing, I think is really healthy for people to do.

1120
01:11:27,258 --> 01:11:31,158
- Meaning there are some puzzles that you haven't quite figured out, maybe you haven't

1121
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:33,458
been honest with yourself about your preferences, all that kind of stuff.

1122
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:36,838
- I don't really like talking about honesty with yourself. I think that's a high

1123
01:11:36,898 --> 01:11:40,508
bar. And I think it's also often weaponized against people, especially by

1124
01:11:40,578 --> 01:11:43,558
men, where it's this idea of you're not really being honest, you're actually gay.

1125
01:11:43,628 --> 01:11:47,378
So I think this idea of we're not being honest with our own sexuality, that's a big

1126
01:11:47,418 --> 01:11:51,158
word. I think it's more that maybe you haven't had the right framework or the

1127
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:55,498
right words to think about aspects of your sexuality that are troubling to you.

1128
01:11:55,558 --> 01:11:59,058
- How obvious... When a person is bisexual, how obvious is it to

1129
01:11:59,138 --> 01:12:06,778
identify the sexual orientation grid? Like how big is the sign, whatever you are?

1130
01:12:06,838 --> 01:12:10,258
- I think the sign is smaller than we think it is. I think that there

1131
01:12:10,378 --> 01:12:17,258
are... There's this tendency to assume that sexuality is something that we

1132
01:12:17,438 --> 01:12:21,418
find, and keep, and consolidate from our

1133
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:25,398
teenage years, maybe early 20s. You maybe get university thrown

1134
01:12:25,438 --> 01:12:28,778
in, sort of if you get your experimental year as an undergrad.

1135
01:12:28,798 --> 01:12:32,698
But you kind of have to choose. And that

1136
01:12:32,838 --> 01:12:36,778
is a difficult requirement, I think, for a lot of people,

1137
01:12:36,818 --> 01:12:40,718
because you can't possibly know all of the things and all the

1138
01:12:40,778 --> 01:12:44,708
people you might be interested in at that point. And we change in every other

1139
01:12:44,798 --> 01:12:48,778
way. Why wouldn't we change in this way? So I think giving ourselves also

1140
01:12:48,838 --> 01:12:52,398
the ability to reappraise where we're at with our own

1141
01:12:52,838 --> 01:12:56,778
sexuality, our own desires, our own relationship status, all these things,

1142
01:12:56,798 --> 01:13:00,698
is important to keep us happy and healthy and to

1143
01:13:00,818 --> 01:13:04,458
not run into issues that we know are faced by a lot of

1144
01:13:04,498 --> 01:13:08,358
homosexual but also bisexual people. Research has found that bisexual people are

1145
01:13:08,398 --> 01:13:12,388
more likely to self-harm. They're more likely to be the victims of sexual violence,

1146
01:13:12,478 --> 01:13:15,938
more likely to be isolated, more likely to be

1147
01:13:15,978 --> 01:13:19,018
stalked. There's lots of different aspects of being bi

1148
01:13:19,698 --> 01:13:23,638
that are negative. The reason for that is mostly because bi people are least

1149
01:13:23,678 --> 01:13:27,522
likely to be plugged into the community. So when you're going

1150
01:13:27,562 --> 01:13:31,512
through stuff like this, and you feel different, and you're constantly being asked about your sexuality,

1151
01:13:31,562 --> 01:13:35,392
if you're open about it, or you're hiding it, that's also troubling.

1152
01:13:35,762 --> 01:13:39,682
You're going to have these negative consequences, especially if you don't feel like the queer community is

1153
01:13:39,722 --> 01:13:43,012
really a place for you. So that's where also finding your people really matters.

1154
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:47,662
- Since we're on the topic of sexuality, one of the things you touched on

1155
01:13:48,242 --> 01:13:52,222
in your book on evil was kinks,

1156
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:56,162
sexual fantasies. I think the point of describing that was that

1157
01:13:56,222 --> 01:13:59,501
we often label that as evil or

1158
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:03,522
bad. What can you say about what you've learned from kinks and sexual

1159
01:14:03,602 --> 01:14:06,202
fantasies from writing that book?

1160
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:09,782
- So the reason I included kinks and evil and

1161
01:14:09,842 --> 01:14:13,581
sexual conversations in general is because it is so

1162
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:17,562
often thrown into the same conversation. So if someone comes to me

1163
01:14:17,581 --> 01:14:21,402
and says, "Julia, I want you to help me explain

1164
01:14:21,462 --> 01:14:25,422
why this person killed this other person." And they'll often

1165
01:14:25,482 --> 01:14:32,782
say, "Did you know that he or she was also into," insert kink here, or,

1166
01:14:32,862 --> 01:14:37,882
insert nontraditional relationship structure here, or insert whatever.

1167
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:42,632
And I respond to that by going, "Okay, so?"

1168
01:14:42,632 --> 01:14:46,492
And I think people use these words like, "Oh, he was really

1169
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:50,062
into BDSM," and think that that's going to have this really

1170
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:53,581
important impact on me. Or, "Ooh, they were swingers."

1171
01:14:53,682 --> 01:14:57,612
And so, and again, I go, "Yeah?" That's

1172
01:14:57,882 --> 01:15:00,371
you know, almost like, "And in other news, they were swingers."

1173
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:04,312
It's like that is not related to this crime at all, unless, you know,

1174
01:15:04,362 --> 01:15:08,012
one of the partners was killed. But people see this as a

1175
01:15:08,121 --> 01:15:12,102
defect of character, and kink is very much seen as a defect of character

1176
01:15:12,162 --> 01:15:16,062
in many circles, especially in sort of broader society.

1177
01:15:16,142 --> 01:15:19,912
And that is wild to me because if you look at

1178
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:23,922
research on sexual fantasies and kinks, a lot of

1179
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:27,822
people have at least one. So a lot of people,

1180
01:15:27,842 --> 01:15:31,522
BDSM being the most common, are engaging in or interested in

1181
01:15:31,562 --> 01:15:35,142
BDSM. So things like choking or things like

1182
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:39,162
restraints or being degraded or doing the degrading of

1183
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:43,062
other people in bed, consensually of course, that is something that a lot of people

1184
01:15:43,102 --> 01:15:46,081
fantasize about and a lot of people engage in. And so these

1185
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,362
kinks and these fetishes, they are much more commonplace than we

1186
01:15:50,382 --> 01:15:54,182
sometimes think about them as. Now, on the other hand, we obviously need to be careful

1187
01:15:54,191 --> 01:15:57,702
not to assume that because in pornography BDSM is almost

1188
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:01,572
ubiquitous, it feels, that that means everybody wants this. That is

1189
01:16:01,621 --> 01:16:05,552
absolutely not the case, but we also don't want to marginalize it and say

1190
01:16:05,581 --> 01:16:09,362
it's almost nobody. It's somewhere in between, and the main thing is always just to

1191
01:16:09,462 --> 01:16:13,422
ask and to have open conversations about what it is that people actually want in bed

1192
01:16:13,462 --> 01:16:17,162
and to make sure you have things like safe words, so, you know, putting in the

1193
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:20,662
restraints to make sure that these interactions are safe and consensual

1194
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:23,222
and then being able to explore. And, I mean, there's

1195
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:27,842
everything from, you know, pup play where you dress up as a

1196
01:16:27,882 --> 01:16:31,822
puppy and you engage in either just general frolicking or sexual

1197
01:16:31,842 --> 01:16:35,630
behavior to other things like blood play, which is

1198
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:39,411
when you pierce the skin to release some sort of blood. That can be scratching. That can be cutting.

1199
01:16:39,442 --> 01:16:43,342
That can be of yourself or your partner. That can be this

1200
01:16:43,442 --> 01:16:47,222
idea of, you know, I don't know, it's this taboo thing you're doing together, and

1201
01:16:47,282 --> 01:16:51,072
it's sexy in its own way. And so everybody has their own versions of

1202
01:16:51,142 --> 01:16:55,121
what they find attractive and rubbing up against people, you know, sort of

1203
01:16:55,162 --> 01:16:58,732
unsuspecting, pretending that someone's sleeping.

1204
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:02,742
There's this wide range of things, and I think

1205
01:17:02,782 --> 01:17:06,612
people also feel often deeply ashamed about the things that they are interested

1206
01:17:06,682 --> 01:17:10,562
in. And I think that is also really sad because it makes it more likely that people

1207
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:14,572
are going to not be able to live that part of themselves and also that they think there's

1208
01:17:14,581 --> 01:17:18,501
something wrong with them. And that can spiral into things like, "Am I evil?

1209
01:17:18,541 --> 01:17:22,142
Am I bad? Am I a bad person because I have these fantasies?" And that ties in,

1210
01:17:22,162 --> 01:17:25,922
unfortunately, with homosexuality and bisexuality and the way that

1211
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:29,962
certainly historically and in most parts of the world still today, these queer

1212
01:17:30,182 --> 01:17:33,892
lives and queer identities are still villainized. They're still seen as

1213
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:37,912
lesser, as bad, as a sign of a defect of character. And if

1214
01:17:37,942 --> 01:17:41,672
people see that within themselves, they're going to think differently about themselves, and we...

1215
01:17:41,682 --> 01:17:45,422
Well, society is going to treat them differently. So it's all about destigmatizing.

1216
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:49,202
- I really liked what you wrote about, I guess it was in the context of BDSM or

1217
01:17:49,262 --> 01:17:52,541
maybe sadomasochism or maybe just the submissive-dominant

1218
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:56,162
dynamic, like why that might be appealing,

1219
01:17:56,222 --> 01:18:00,041
the disinhibition hypothesis. I guess this applies

1220
01:18:00,062 --> 01:18:04,001
generally to sexual fantasies is if you live them out, that you

1221
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:07,382
could just let go of all the bullshit that we, that we put up in normal

1222
01:18:07,422 --> 01:18:13,802
society. That you could just be all in, fully present to the pleasure of it.

1223
01:18:13,882 --> 01:18:17,842
- Right, and that's what research has found on fetishes, especially on BDSM, is

1224
01:18:17,882 --> 01:18:21,802
that the reason that people say they like it... I mean, it's hard to explain why you have a

1225
01:18:21,842 --> 01:18:25,371
fantasy. But if you go into the finer questions and

1226
01:18:25,662 --> 01:18:27,982
really dig deep, you can find that people

1227
01:18:28,802 --> 01:18:32,702
will explain a version of, "Well, I can really let go, and

1228
01:18:32,802 --> 01:18:36,702
I don't have to... If someone is telling me what to do, then I don't have to

1229
01:18:36,722 --> 01:18:40,621
make any decisions, and I've spent all day making millions of

1230
01:18:40,662 --> 01:18:44,371
decisions, and I don't have to in this context. And I really like that because it's

1231
01:18:44,382 --> 01:18:47,562
freeing." And so that's that disinhibition hypothesis is that the

1232
01:18:47,581 --> 01:18:50,912
reason that we often go to things in the

1233
01:18:50,922 --> 01:18:54,902
bedroom that in other contexts we don't like or even find

1234
01:18:54,942 --> 01:18:58,282
repulsive, like I don't in normal life potentially want to be told what to

1235
01:18:58,362 --> 01:19:02,302
do. But maybe when you move into the bedroom, you go, "Yeah, but this is a different

1236
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:05,522
context, and I kind of want the reverse of what I want in my day-to-day

1237
01:19:05,562 --> 01:19:09,182
life." And so I can also understand, like, furries and that sort of

1238
01:19:09,222 --> 01:19:13,102
completely living as another species of it, even

1239
01:19:13,202 --> 01:19:17,152
is... It's a really interesting psychological phenomenon of release

1240
01:19:17,322 --> 01:19:19,982
and of letting go of social pressure.

1241
01:19:20,001 --> 01:19:23,102
- But I think that also applies to... Because you mentioned submissive,

1242
01:19:23,162 --> 01:19:26,742
that's more straightforward to understand. I think that also applies to dominant,

1243
01:19:27,702 --> 01:19:34,326
because like, yeah, you don't have to walk on eggshells. It's the clarity of it.

1244
01:19:34,386 --> 01:19:38,166
That was really interesting. Having read that from you, that

1245
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:42,186
really made me think that there is a deep truth to that, to like

1246
01:19:42,286 --> 01:19:44,496
being true to whatever the sexual fantasy is.

1247
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:52,586
It's not just the fantasy itself that's appealing, it's the being free in some

1248
01:19:52,646 --> 01:19:53,486
sense.

1249
01:19:53,546 --> 01:19:57,466
- It's the being free, and the juxtaposition there is that you are free because of the

1250
01:19:57,486 --> 01:20:03,106
fiction. Like you're playacting, but it's touching at

1251
01:20:03,116 --> 01:20:06,986
something deep inside you psychologically. And so that's where it sort

1252
01:20:07,026 --> 01:20:10,986
of feels weird, but it also makes sense. I mean, this is also why we like fiction,

1253
01:20:11,026 --> 01:20:15,006
because it allows you to maybe be somebody else, have someone else's thoughts

1254
01:20:15,046 --> 01:20:18,606
in your mind for a while, and you really get to live as that for a bit. So I

1255
01:20:18,646 --> 01:20:25,546
think, yeah, the truth and fiction sort of circle is always an interesting one.

1256
01:20:25,606 --> 01:20:29,436
- So you've, for researching the Bi book, the bisexuality

1257
01:20:29,526 --> 01:20:33,426
book, what have you learned about sexuality in general, human nature,

1258
01:20:33,486 --> 01:20:37,346
sexuality, and how it's practiced in terms of different communities?

1259
01:20:37,426 --> 01:20:40,806
And I'm sure there are subcultures and stuff. Yeah. What have you learned?

1260
01:20:40,816 --> 01:20:44,156
- So, the research on human sexuality, I think, is interesting, because

1261
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,636
we keep finding that people have these

1262
01:20:47,646 --> 01:20:51,616
desires that they feel weird about, that they...

1263
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:58,786
Unless they have a community or an app that you can go to to live those

1264
01:20:58,846 --> 01:21:01,876
fantasies, they can feel quite troubling to the individual

1265
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:06,226
and they can make you unwell. And that's true whether it's about your sexuality,

1266
01:21:06,266 --> 01:21:10,176
so being gay and being unable to live as a gay person, or if

1267
01:21:10,246 --> 01:21:14,186
that's wanting to engage in BDSM and not having an outlet for that.

1268
01:21:14,246 --> 01:21:17,786
So that can just make you unhappy. So I think that the stigma there

1269
01:21:17,826 --> 01:21:21,546
is that that unhappiness is going to lead to some sort of horrible manifestations of

1270
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:25,336
crime. I think that is mostly nonsense, but it's more that

1271
01:21:25,386 --> 01:21:29,006
I'm concerned about the mental health consequences for the individual who's unable

1272
01:21:29,066 --> 01:21:32,766
to explore those sides of themselves. And in research

1273
01:21:32,886 --> 01:21:36,746
on kinks and sexuality, it's just about

1274
01:21:36,806 --> 01:21:40,315
also making sure that we have visible representation of certain kinds of

1275
01:21:40,366 --> 01:21:44,186
communities. And so that's one of the reasons I ended up writing Bi. I came out in

1276
01:21:44,246 --> 01:21:49,006
Evil. Making Evil is the UK title, Evil in the US. I came out because

1277
01:21:49,186 --> 01:21:52,746
I was writing about all the things we associate with the word evil, and

1278
01:21:52,786 --> 01:21:54,986
homosexuality certainly is one of those things.

1279
01:21:55,046 --> 01:21:56,796
- You came out as bisexual, by the way. Yeah.

1280
01:21:56,826 --> 01:22:00,686
- Yeah, I came out as bisexual. And I came out as bisexual in the book,

1281
01:22:00,766 --> 01:22:04,475
and I did it specifically, and I wrote it this way, as well, because I was

1282
01:22:04,506 --> 01:22:08,376
talking about the importance of visibility, and how it's

1283
01:22:08,376 --> 01:22:12,246
through visibility that you realize that the people around you, people you already know and

1284
01:22:12,306 --> 01:22:17,626
love, are part of this community that otherwise feels other.

1285
01:22:17,646 --> 01:22:21,586
It feels foreign, it feels abstract, and maybe it feels scary. But if

1286
01:22:21,626 --> 01:22:25,546
you realize that actually you've got gay friends or you've got friends who are into certain kinds of fetishes.

1287
01:22:25,586 --> 01:22:29,566
certain kinds of fetishes, or you've got friends who are whatever sexuality aspect you're talking

1288
01:22:29,646 --> 01:22:33,446
about, you suddenly go, "Oh, it's gonna be much harder to

1289
01:22:33,486 --> 01:22:37,346
dehumanize these people." And this is where all of

1290
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:40,966
this kind of comes for me from a really sad place is

1291
01:22:41,006 --> 01:22:44,586
the... You could talk about Bi as this project of love and how I was finding the

1292
01:22:44,606 --> 01:22:47,576
community. I was trying to write something that would sort of bring us all

1293
01:22:47,586 --> 01:22:51,456
together. But it's also because I'm constantly terrified that

1294
01:22:51,486 --> 01:22:55,046
my rights are going to be stripped back. And we know that

1295
01:22:55,106 --> 01:22:59,606
the laws around homosexual behavior and

1296
01:23:00,426 --> 01:23:06,326
the rights around bisexual people as well, they're in flux. There's no

1297
01:23:06,466 --> 01:23:10,346
straight line of acceptance. And just because right now I happen

1298
01:23:10,406 --> 01:23:14,276
to live in a time and place where I'm allowed to be openly bisexual and

1299
01:23:14,276 --> 01:23:18,096
I can engage in homosexual activity, that doesn't mean that that's gonna stay,

1300
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:22,096
not even necessarily in my lifetime. And so I think, much

1301
01:23:22,126 --> 01:23:26,096
like writing Evil at a time when you're not at war and you're able to think really deeply

1302
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:29,286
about these important issues, I think we also need to be thinking about things like

1303
01:23:29,306 --> 01:23:33,286
sexuality and other issues that are important to us. And if we want to preserve our rights,

1304
01:23:33,346 --> 01:23:37,326
we need to normalize these issues and make sure that they're visible so that people

1305
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:40,946
find it harder to dehumanize those communities. And so I'm always

1306
01:23:41,006 --> 01:23:44,946
terrified that bisexual people are gonna be hypersexualized, dehumanized again, and that

1307
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,486
there's going to be laws against basically just who I am.

1308
01:23:47,546 --> 01:23:51,216
- Did you hear from a bunch of people after Making Evil After Evil, the book,

1309
01:23:51,266 --> 01:23:54,816
and mentioning and coming out in that book and then writing,

1310
01:23:54,946 --> 01:24:02,586
the Bi book that, that are bisexual and maybe what are some stories? I'm sure...

1311
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:06,416
'Cause I haven't seen much material on it as you spoke to, so I'm sure they

1312
01:24:06,466 --> 01:24:08,776
felt lonely without a community, right?

1313
01:24:08,826 --> 01:24:12,636
- Yeah. A lot of people felt seen by the book. So it was really beautiful, the

1314
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:16,566
fan mail I got and the sort of responses to the book. And I got

1315
01:24:16,586 --> 01:24:20,566
them from all over the world. And so in the book, I also spoke with some researchers who were

1316
01:24:20,646 --> 01:24:24,286
stationed or doing research in countries where

1317
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:28,096
bisexual behavior specifically is illegal, or homosexual behavior was

1318
01:24:28,106 --> 01:24:31,526
illegal. For a long time, bisexuality was, especially in women,

1319
01:24:31,646 --> 01:24:34,916
well, actually, homosexuality in women in general was sort of seen

1320
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:41,466
as... it was, it was a blind spot, 'cause what counted as sex is sex with a penis.

1321
01:24:41,506 --> 01:24:45,056
And so women can't have sex with one another. And so a lot of laws around

1322
01:24:45,066 --> 01:24:48,886
homosexuality are specifically applying to men. And certainly, historically,

1323
01:24:48,926 --> 01:24:52,306
that's the case. So we're talking about like sodomy and that

1324
01:24:52,386 --> 01:24:59,526
involves men and not women. And so if you look at the evolution of laws, for a

1325
01:24:59,566 --> 01:25:03,506
while, women were kind of... like it was socially not necessarily acceptable, but

1326
01:25:03,526 --> 01:25:07,896
they were kind of getting away with it legally. But then more recently, especially,

1327
01:25:08,706 --> 01:25:12,546
as bisexuality gets more visible as well, certain countries have started

1328
01:25:12,566 --> 01:25:16,186
writing it specifically into their constitutions and so specifically into their

1329
01:25:16,246 --> 01:25:20,226
laws that bisexual identities and behaviors are also seen as

1330
01:25:20,606 --> 01:25:24,466
problematic and illegal. So again, these laws change all the time.

1331
01:25:24,526 --> 01:25:28,226
But in terms of fan mail, especially from people in countries where

1332
01:25:28,266 --> 01:25:32,186
homosexuality and bisexuality are illegal or are

1333
01:25:32,246 --> 01:25:36,034
seen as problematic, are socially condemned — that was

1334
01:25:36,054 --> 01:25:39,954
particularly important, so that those people were particularly writing

1335
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:43,714
saying, some of them also saying, "Can I translate this into this other language, on the

1336
01:25:43,733 --> 01:25:47,603
DL, like on the down low? And just, like, distribute this to my friends?"

1337
01:25:47,654 --> 01:25:51,534
I had people sending me messages saying, "I'm at X airport

1338
01:25:51,574 --> 01:25:54,523
or in X country where this is, this would be considered

1339
01:25:54,954 --> 01:25:58,914
contraband." Like this book, my book is a banned book, fun fact.

1340
01:25:58,994 --> 01:25:59,374
- Nice.

1341
01:25:59,634 --> 01:26:03,544
- It was banned. I, I sold the rights to a foreign publisher, and

1342
01:26:03,614 --> 01:26:07,554
right after it was sold, the laws changed and they sent me this really sad email saying, "Unfortunately, we

1343
01:26:07,594 --> 01:26:11,574
can't publish your book because it's now considered part of the, like, gay agenda, sort

1344
01:26:11,634 --> 01:26:16,754
of promoting gay and homosexual lifestyles. And so we can't publish

1345
01:26:16,773 --> 01:26:20,714
it anymore." But there's, I take like a little bit of pride in the fact that it's a banned book, but

1346
01:26:20,813 --> 01:26:24,714
I find it really sad, obviously, as to what it means, but it also makes me feel like it's more important.

1347
01:26:24,733 --> 01:26:26,914
And that's what people were writing to me about.

1348
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:30,893
- What advice would you give to young people, or just people in general

1349
01:26:30,954 --> 01:26:37,534
that are trying to figure out their sexuality or how to speak about their sexuality?

1350
01:26:37,634 --> 01:26:45,514
- I'd say try and read widely on issues around sexuality. Books like mine, but

1351
01:26:45,574 --> 01:26:49,114
also other books might help you to navigate whether or not

1352
01:26:50,294 --> 01:26:54,214
you're, you know, what labels there are and also whether or not those labels

1353
01:26:54,254 --> 01:26:58,174
are good for you. I think things like the Klein grid are really helpful, especially for people who are

1354
01:26:58,193 --> 01:27:02,174
more analytically minded like you and I. I think it gives you a construct

1355
01:27:02,214 --> 01:27:05,594
to work with and numbers to work with, and that can be really helpful to try and go

1356
01:27:06,074 --> 01:27:10,014
almost seeing your sexuality as a mathematical equation. And I think that can be

1357
01:27:10,054 --> 01:27:13,893
quite useful. And if that's how you think, then look at the Klein

1358
01:27:13,934 --> 01:27:15,954
grid and see if that helps you to navigate things.

1359
01:27:16,034 --> 01:27:19,794
- A bit of a tricky question, but what are the pros and cons of coming out

1360
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:23,414
publicly as a non-standard sexuality?

1361
01:27:23,424 --> 01:27:28,483
From a recommendation perspective, what are some benefits and

1362
01:27:29,414 --> 01:27:31,054
what are some challenges?

1363
01:27:31,094 --> 01:27:35,004
- So the benefits are that you can, well, live authentically. You can

1364
01:27:35,054 --> 01:27:38,474
just be yourself. So I do feel more free in who I am and who I'm able

1365
01:27:38,534 --> 01:27:42,114
to sort of be online, for example, now that I'm out.

1366
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:45,402
And because I came out after, in my 30s, I think

1367
01:27:45,452 --> 01:27:49,114
also it was almost a foot-in-the-door technique as well, which is a

1368
01:27:49,134 --> 01:27:52,534
psychological technique of first coming in and then coming with your big

1369
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:55,974
ask. And so I'd already published two books.

1370
01:27:56,034 --> 01:27:59,954
I was already an established scientist. I think if I tried bi first, I, A, wouldn't have

1371
01:27:59,994 --> 01:28:02,954
been able to publish the book. It was the first mainstream book on bisexuality ever.

1372
01:28:03,693 --> 01:28:07,554
And B, I don't think I would've been taken seriously as a

1373
01:28:07,594 --> 01:28:11,254
scientist. And so having the other stuff first and then

1374
01:28:11,313 --> 01:28:15,294
bi as sort of a side project, that was acceptable. But I think

1375
01:28:15,334 --> 01:28:16,154
the other way around wouldn't have been.

1376
01:28:16,193 --> 01:28:20,174
- I think it was still brave. I think you mentioned somewhere, maybe

1377
01:28:20,233 --> 01:28:23,804
in an interview, that there was some concern of being sexualized when

1378
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:26,313
you covered the topic of sexuality.

1379
01:28:26,324 --> 01:28:29,483
- There still is, but I actually find that it's

1380
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:33,134
done the opposite most of the time. So I think, as a

1381
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:39,414
woman, especially a young woman in the public eye, you're sexualized anyway,

1382
01:28:39,474 --> 01:28:43,094
unfortunately. And so that is

1383
01:28:43,174 --> 01:28:46,494
and was already a huge part of my online experience. And

1384
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:50,594
actually, I think coming out as bi, A, you get allies

1385
01:28:50,614 --> 01:28:53,834
who suddenly are like, "We're on your side. We're going to help you fight the

1386
01:28:53,853 --> 01:28:57,733
hypersexualization." And people get almost more

1387
01:28:57,794 --> 01:29:01,754
weird about it in a good way. They get a bit quiet about it because they're like, "Oh, now it's

1388
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:05,294
an identity thing. So maybe I shouldn't comment on what she's

1389
01:29:05,334 --> 01:29:09,242
wearing." And it sort of, it almost disarmed some of

1390
01:29:09,254 --> 01:29:13,074
the more sexualized comments. So for me, I have to say it was mostly a positive

1391
01:29:13,094 --> 01:29:13,853
experience.

1392
01:29:13,893 --> 01:29:15,514
- The incels didn't know what to do with it.

1393
01:29:15,574 --> 01:29:18,463
- Exactly. Like, "Ugh."

1394
01:29:18,574 --> 01:29:23,534
- Just to go back to the beginning, what got you interested in criminal psychology?

1395
01:29:23,554 --> 01:29:27,134
- Well, if you look at my trajectory into

1396
01:29:27,174 --> 01:29:31,004
academia and then through it, basically what happened is

1397
01:29:31,994 --> 01:29:33,264
I was ready to go study art.

1398
01:29:33,974 --> 01:29:33,983
- Nice.

1399
01:29:33,994 --> 01:29:37,773
- That's what happened. I had my portfolio ready to go. I was going to study art

1400
01:29:37,954 --> 01:29:41,054
at undergrad, and then my grandfather intervened and was

1401
01:29:41,094 --> 01:29:45,483
like, "Being an artist is a really hard life. Maybe you should reconsider."

1402
01:29:45,494 --> 01:29:47,474
- What kind of art? Sorry to take that tangent.

1403
01:29:47,574 --> 01:29:48,773
- Uh, painting.

1404
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:53,014
- That is wild. I would not have expected that, cause you're so super analytical.

1405
01:29:53,054 --> 01:29:56,834
- Yeah, I am, but I also really like surrealism, and I really like

1406
01:29:56,933 --> 01:30:00,894
messing with the sense of reality, which again, is obviously something that then wove its

1407
01:30:00,974 --> 01:30:02,964
way into my academic work. Um...

1408
01:30:02,974 --> 01:30:03,063
- That's cool.

1409
01:30:03,114 --> 01:30:06,134
- But he was also right. I've always been very

1410
01:30:06,874 --> 01:30:10,603
intellectual, let's just say. I skipped a couple grades in school. I was part of the chess club.

1411
01:30:10,634 --> 01:30:15,054
It was very much I was the clever kid. And so,

1412
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:19,914
but there's also a part of me that's just like, "But art is beautiful. I love making art and it can speak to

1413
01:30:19,933 --> 01:30:23,764
so many people." Anyway, my grandfather convinced me not to do it, and then I applied

1414
01:30:24,174 --> 01:30:27,773
instead for psychology. Although at that point you just had to

1415
01:30:27,813 --> 01:30:31,754
say social sciences. You didn't have to specify, but I knew it was probably going to be

1416
01:30:31,773 --> 01:30:33,514
psychology. And the reason for that

1417
01:30:34,334 --> 01:30:38,174
was because my dad has paranoid schizophrenia. And so I think one of the

1418
01:30:38,214 --> 01:30:41,414
reasons I'm so obsessed with this idea of what is real,

1419
01:30:41,494 --> 01:30:45,114
and that is in every way that,

1420
01:30:45,154 --> 01:30:49,063
that... I mean that in terms of what is real in terms of perceptions of right and

1421
01:30:49,094 --> 01:30:52,733
wrong, what is real in terms of our own memories of the

1422
01:30:52,773 --> 01:30:56,554
world, what is real in terms of what happened in a crime, what is real in

1423
01:30:56,574 --> 01:31:00,454
terms of perceptual abilities and neuroscience, what is real. I mean,

1424
01:31:00,523 --> 01:31:04,394
I mean that in every way, and I think that's because I grew up

1425
01:31:04,454 --> 01:31:11,644
with someone who had a unique view of what is real in real time. And

1426
01:31:11,714 --> 01:31:15,193
so seeing that, I think just affected

1427
01:31:15,214 --> 01:31:19,183
me profoundly, because not only was it very destabilizing in terms of my upbringing, but

1428
01:31:19,254 --> 01:31:22,813
also it's just in your face that people

1429
01:31:23,554 --> 01:31:27,514
quite literally are seeing and hearing different things than you. And

1430
01:31:28,034 --> 01:31:31,974
to not jump from that to what else are people perceiving differently than me, I think

1431
01:31:32,014 --> 01:31:35,883
I think would be almost like a missed opportunity. And so I went to study psychology

1432
01:31:35,994 --> 01:31:39,974
partly to understand that and what was going on there, and then that took me down the sort

1433
01:31:39,994 --> 01:31:43,679
of reality hole. And honestly, the reason I went into criminal psychology,

1434
01:31:44,049 --> 01:31:47,490
is because I could have gone into any other, but the criminal psychologists were the most fun.

1435
01:31:48,549 --> 01:31:52,450
I feel like lots of psychologists take themselves so seriously.

1436
01:31:52,509 --> 01:31:56,490
And I just, I couldn't. I was like, "I don't, this isn't the

1437
01:31:56,530 --> 01:32:00,349
vibe." And so the criminal psychologists, they had this gallows

1438
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:04,030
humor. They were doing arguably the most serious of the crimes and the

1439
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:07,940
cases, and yet, were somehow having

1440
01:32:07,950 --> 01:32:11,549
fun and having nice lives. And I saw myself and I went,

1441
01:32:11,570 --> 01:32:15,089
"Well, I want to do this version." And so I did.

1442
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:18,750
- Yeah, that's great to hear, that a criminal psychologist, because probably they have to

1443
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:23,990
really, more than any other subfield, confront the reality of the mind.

1444
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:28,469
- And it's often quite procedural. So I'm also much more

1445
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:32,269
interested in applied sciences because I like the idea

1446
01:32:32,429 --> 01:32:36,349
of, you know, what do we do with this information?

1447
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:40,139
And the thing that interests me most from a research perspective, I mean, I did my

1448
01:32:40,169 --> 01:32:43,389
PhD in false memories, so implanting false memories of committing

1449
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:47,089
crime, which was the study that ended up going viral because

1450
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:52,190
I was the first to do it. And I built on a history of people implanting false

1451
01:32:52,269 --> 01:32:56,230
memories of various kinds of other emotional events. But it was the first time someone had

1452
01:32:56,269 --> 01:33:00,250
combined false confessions research and false memory research.

1453
01:33:00,269 --> 01:33:04,059
And so that was the research of Elizabeth Loftus and Saul Kassin. So false

1454
01:33:04,089 --> 01:33:07,989
confessions was Saul Kassin and false memories was Elizabeth Loftus. And I was

1455
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:12,009
just doing them both at the same time. And the question was, could you get people to believe that

1456
01:33:12,049 --> 01:33:15,650
they committed a crime that never happened and confess to it?

1457
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:20,049
And not just that, but believe that it actually happened, so remember it?

1458
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:23,830
And the answer to that in short is yes, you can, especially using specific

1459
01:33:24,009 --> 01:33:27,990
leading and suggestive interview techniques. And so the procedural learning

1460
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:31,750
from that, which is what I'm most interested in, I don't, like that's sort of a party trick to be able to actually do

1461
01:33:31,790 --> 01:33:35,690
it. And that's just so that you can then take that and go, "Okay, well, how do we prevent

1462
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:39,629
this?" And so I've since trained police lawyers.

1463
01:33:39,650 --> 01:33:43,370
I've trained people at the ICC, the International Criminal Court, who deal with

1464
01:33:43,549 --> 01:33:46,589
collective memory, so they deal with hundreds of witnesses at a time in war

1465
01:33:46,690 --> 01:33:49,989
crimes. And the question is, how do we try to

1466
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:53,820
preserve as original as possible memory without contaminating it?

1467
01:33:53,830 --> 01:33:57,809
Because well, or at least without contaminating it any more than it already is.

1468
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:01,759
And that's where social psychology, I think, excels, is that we have done

1469
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:05,580
lots of research on how social settings change what people

1470
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:09,429
say, and to some extent, what people believe. And I think that's also where

1471
01:34:09,490 --> 01:34:12,870
actually the leap to things like AI, I think, is

1472
01:34:13,290 --> 01:34:17,070
not far, because ultimately, the way that we're engaging with large language models

1473
01:34:17,809 --> 01:34:21,650
and generative AI in general, is that it's structured as a

1474
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:25,099
social interaction. It's structured as a conversation most of the time now,

1475
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:29,080
and that is what we do. I mean, that is literally what

1476
01:34:29,129 --> 01:34:32,950
I train the police on doing, is how to make sure that you don't distort people's

1477
01:34:32,990 --> 01:34:36,900
memories in the process and how to ask good questions. So you get confabulations from both sides

1478
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:40,790
now. You get confabulations from AI and from the people. And the

1479
01:34:40,809 --> 01:34:44,599
problem is that there's a third thing, which is the in-between, that I'm not sure is

1480
01:34:44,629 --> 01:34:48,530
getting enough attention right now. And I wish that there was more

1481
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:52,110
integration of social scientists like me and people who do

1482
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:55,610
investigative interviewing and have done it for decades to

1483
01:34:55,669 --> 01:34:59,519
understand what is happening in the in-between. And so that we can both teach the

1484
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:03,309
people and the AI to respond better in that situation.

1485
01:35:03,349 --> 01:35:07,049
- I mean, it's really interesting. Are you saying that there's a drift of some kind in terms of

1486
01:35:08,049 --> 01:35:11,870
on both the AI and human side when they're interacting together that we need to

1487
01:35:11,889 --> 01:35:13,400
be very clear about?

1488
01:35:13,469 --> 01:35:21,549
- Yes. What we've created with Gen AI is basically the ultimate false

1489
01:35:21,610 --> 01:35:24,769
memory machine. We have created a tailored

1490
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:28,589
experience of something that is most of the time

1491
01:35:29,269 --> 01:35:31,709
telling you what it thinks you want to hear,

1492
01:35:32,889 --> 01:35:36,759
and then it's uncritically giving that to you. Or sometimes,

1493
01:35:36,809 --> 01:35:40,509
of course, there are other things where it's appraising whether or not this is truthful or

1494
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:44,250
not. But it is giving that to you. And there's no

1495
01:35:44,370 --> 01:35:48,360
safeguard from you just going, "This is truth, and this is my past," or, "This

1496
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:52,200
is how I remembered it." And the problem is that not

1497
01:35:52,269 --> 01:35:56,030
only is AI potentially distorting people and their memories,

1498
01:35:56,049 --> 01:35:59,769
never mind the factual basis on which they're relying, but it's also the other way

1499
01:35:59,808 --> 01:36:03,549
around: that potentially by asking leading or problematic

1500
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:06,910
questions, people are changing how the AI is creating the

1501
01:36:06,969 --> 01:36:10,870
content, which is in turn on some fundamental level potentially having an impact

1502
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:14,469
on how it's discerning truth from fiction. And so that's

1503
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:18,349
where the false memory in human minds and confabulations in

1504
01:36:18,410 --> 01:36:22,089
AI, I think, are much more similar than we

1505
01:36:22,129 --> 01:36:26,070
think. And when I first saw AI confabulate, hallucinate, I

1506
01:36:26,089 --> 01:36:29,370
was like, "This is what people do all the time." It's just that we can't fact-check them all the time.

1507
01:36:29,389 --> 01:36:32,490
We're not in a conversation constantly being like, "Well, is that quite

1508
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:36,370
right? I'm going to use that for my homework," right? So,

1509
01:36:36,469 --> 01:36:40,190
it's both juicy and really troubling.

1510
01:36:40,230 --> 01:36:44,169
- Well, right now the interactions are pretty ephemeral. They're short-lasting, and there's

1511
01:36:44,209 --> 01:36:48,610
not really a deep memory to the interactions. But this could get a lot worse

1512
01:36:49,570 --> 01:36:53,469
if the AI is personalized to a degree where it remembers things about you

1513
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:57,650
so that you can then start to, over many interactions,

1514
01:36:57,769 --> 01:37:01,410
feed the narrative about your past that you

1515
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:05,339
construct together with the AI over time.

1516
01:37:05,349 --> 01:37:09,049
- But you don't even need that. So this is what we find in investigative interviewing, which is police

1517
01:37:09,089 --> 01:37:12,849
interviewing of witnesses and suspects, is that all you

1518
01:37:12,889 --> 01:37:16,849
need is a leading question or a suggestive piece of information. In a

1519
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:18,940
short interaction, most people, most police officers

1520
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:22,349
don't spend a long time, and they have no memory of this person's

1521
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:25,889
past. They know basically nothing about them except for things related to the

1522
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:29,690
crime. And yet we know that within that very short,

1523
01:37:29,830 --> 01:37:32,709
maybe half hour, one-hour interaction, people's stories can change

1524
01:37:32,849 --> 01:37:36,709
fundamentally. And the problem is that if you have a memory of

1525
01:37:36,769 --> 01:37:39,049
something, that when you pull it up,

1526
01:37:39,849 --> 01:37:43,929
in that social interaction, it's sort of live. It's like active.

1527
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:47,969
And when you then finish that interaction, it sets back down.

1528
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:51,950
And the thing is that if you put it back in a different way, what's going to happen is the

1529
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:55,699
next time you're going to remember the latest version. And you might not

1530
01:37:55,709 --> 01:37:59,682
realize that it shifted. So over time, it can shift and you don't realize it,

1531
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:01,321
and that's your truth. And that's where

1532
01:38:02,581 --> 01:38:05,942
even just short interactions can have a profound impact on the human mind.

1533
01:38:06,102 --> 01:38:08,962
- Wow, so you can modify memories that quickly?

1534
01:38:09,001 --> 01:38:11,422
- Yeah. We do all the time in experiments.

1535
01:38:11,462 --> 01:38:14,581
- Okay, can you speak a little bit more to false memory? So, like, it's just

1536
01:38:14,701 --> 01:38:18,501
fascinating. So things happen to us. We humans

1537
01:38:19,462 --> 01:38:23,302
do things in the world, and then we remember them. And most of our lives, I guess,

1538
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:28,012
is lived in memory, in remembering the things that happened to us. And you're saying

1539
01:38:29,121 --> 01:38:33,362
that we can modify the story we tell about the things that happened to us?

1540
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:39,442
That's fascinating. So what do we know about this ability to have false memories?

1541
01:38:40,222 --> 01:38:44,102
- We know that false memories are common, that they're a feature of

1542
01:38:44,142 --> 01:38:47,562
a normal, healthy brain. They're not this glitch, they are a

1543
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:51,121
feature. And we know that false memories are

1544
01:38:52,241 --> 01:38:56,161
incredibly common, in terms of if you think about basically

1545
01:38:56,262 --> 01:39:00,102
any memory... Now, I'm interested in autobiographical memories. This isn't memories of

1546
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:04,062
facts. This is memories of experiences, things that you've lived in

1547
01:39:04,121 --> 01:39:07,862
some way. And of those autobiographical memories, basically every

1548
01:39:07,942 --> 01:39:11,862
single autobiographical memory you have is false. The question isn't whether it's false, the question

1549
01:39:11,882 --> 01:39:14,672
is how false. You're despairing over there.

1550
01:39:14,682 --> 01:39:18,201
- Well, I mean, yeah, that's... I mean, it's both beautiful and terrifying...

1551
01:39:18,402 --> 01:39:19,562
...that nothing is real.

1552
01:39:19,922 --> 01:39:21,342
- No, that's not, that's not what I'm saying.

1553
01:39:21,402 --> 01:39:21,762
- Okay.

1554
01:39:21,821 --> 01:39:25,762
- I'm just saying that everything has a degree of falsehood to it.

1555
01:39:25,821 --> 01:39:29,772
And this is where sometimes I'll get accused of being like, "Oh, but that... does that mean we can

1556
01:39:29,772 --> 01:39:33,382
never use witness statements?" That... I'm not saying we can't use any witness statements.

1557
01:39:33,422 --> 01:39:37,212
I'm just saying that we need to be careful because even if people say things with confidence, it

1558
01:39:37,222 --> 01:39:40,862
doesn't necessarily mean they're true, or if they have multisensory details,

1559
01:39:40,902 --> 01:39:44,852
they're describing in very specific detail what they smelled, what they heard, what

1560
01:39:44,882 --> 01:39:48,821
they... whatever. It doesn't mean it's necessarily true.

1561
01:39:48,902 --> 01:39:54,102
Most of the time, our autobiographical memories are good enough.

1562
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:57,281
And that's where... memory scientists talk about this as gist

1563
01:39:57,442 --> 01:40:01,402
memory. Our gist memory for events, much like for text,

1564
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:05,321
you get the gist of it, right? You're good enough. You generally remember

1565
01:40:05,462 --> 01:40:09,402
accurately approximately what happened. But it's when you get to the so-called

1566
01:40:09,482 --> 01:40:13,342
verbatim details, the specific details of memories that

1567
01:40:13,462 --> 01:40:17,262
you find people are often really bad.

1568
01:40:17,342 --> 01:40:21,262
Now, most of the time that doesn't really matter because you remember you hung out with a friend,

1569
01:40:21,302 --> 01:40:25,062
you remember you were at this university, you remember approximately what your favorite

1570
01:40:25,102 --> 01:40:29,092
cafe was, you remember this important negative or positive event. Fine.

1571
01:40:29,121 --> 01:40:33,102
You don't actually need to know exactly what you were wearing and drinking and saying.

1572
01:40:33,142 --> 01:40:37,001
But in a criminal justice setting, you do need to remember exactly what you were

1573
01:40:37,041 --> 01:40:40,902
drinking and saying and doing, right? And so that's where

1574
01:40:40,982 --> 01:40:44,882
we have this need to break down this

1575
01:40:44,962 --> 01:40:50,462
human capacity for memory to this level of detail that it's just not made for.

1576
01:40:50,701 --> 01:40:54,182
- So that's where the verbatim stuff can get you into trouble, 'cause with criminal

1577
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:56,581
cases, I suppose the tiniest details

1578
01:40:57,642 --> 01:41:01,442
really matter 'cause then the lawyers can really zoom in on that.

1579
01:41:01,462 --> 01:41:04,062
particular detail, and then you could just make that up. And then the

1580
01:41:04,802 --> 01:41:08,321
interrogation with a leading question, as you were saying, can just

1581
01:41:08,422 --> 01:41:12,382
alter your memory of a particular detail, and then everything will hang

1582
01:41:12,422 --> 01:41:13,382
on that detail.

1583
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:17,362
- Right, and if that particular detail is someone's face, then that's a really big problem.

1584
01:41:17,402 --> 01:41:17,942
- You're right.

1585
01:41:17,982 --> 01:41:21,842
- And so, and it can also be an entire false

1586
01:41:21,902 --> 01:41:25,451
memory. So this is where in my research and in research like mine, we've

1587
01:41:25,501 --> 01:41:29,371
implanted, well, memories, what we call memories or

1588
01:41:29,382 --> 01:41:33,312
false memories, of experiences that never happened at all. So while most things

1589
01:41:33,362 --> 01:41:37,222
are modifications of real memories, false memories, complete false

1590
01:41:37,281 --> 01:41:41,022
memories are when you think you experienced something that you didn't. And we all

1591
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:44,462
have them. We all have some memories that can't be

1592
01:41:44,501 --> 01:41:48,362
true, and we usually realize them, for example, when we talk to our parents about our

1593
01:41:48,402 --> 01:41:52,321
childhood or when we talk to friends and we say, "Remember that time we

1594
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:56,281
did this?" And your friend will go, "That happened to me, that didn't happen

1595
01:41:56,321 --> 01:42:01,222
to you." And you become what is known in research as a memory thief. Where

1596
01:42:01,342 --> 01:42:05,321
you've stolen somebody else's memory and you've accepted

1597
01:42:05,362 --> 01:42:09,262
it, or your brain has accepted it as your own. And that's possibly because the other person

1598
01:42:09,302 --> 01:42:13,081
told it in such vivid detail that you could imagine it, and basically your brain was

1599
01:42:13,121 --> 01:42:16,800
like, "Well, this feels real now." And so the next time you thought about that,

1600
01:42:16,861 --> 01:42:20,522
maybe, maybe not the next time, but maybe after a couple of times of thinking about it, you

1601
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:24,652
started going, "This happened to me, right?" And then you integrate it into

1602
01:42:24,682 --> 01:42:26,241
your autobiography.

1603
01:42:26,342 --> 01:42:29,262
- How hard is it to insert false memories?

1604
01:42:29,382 --> 01:42:30,701
- Not hard.

1605
01:42:30,902 --> 01:42:34,572
It's very easy to distort memories or to insert small false memories. It's

1606
01:42:34,621 --> 01:42:38,602
harder to convince people of entire events, especially specific events.

1607
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:42,201
And this is widely debated exactly how easy it is to implant a

1608
01:42:42,281 --> 01:42:45,672
specific false memory. It's also one of the big debates around my own research

1609
01:42:46,182 --> 01:42:49,491
is that when I was writing The Memory Illusion, which was my first

1610
01:42:49,562 --> 01:42:53,522
book, and the research that was in line with that, there was this huge

1611
01:42:53,562 --> 01:42:57,491
debate between me and a couple of other academics about

1612
01:42:57,522 --> 01:43:00,661
what it means for something to be a false memory and how we should talk

1613
01:43:00,762 --> 01:43:04,402
about the ease with which they're implanted, and that is still one of the

1614
01:43:04,442 --> 01:43:08,232
biggest scientific debates in our field. And to me, I think

1615
01:43:08,281 --> 01:43:11,621
that's... So the coding stuff is about the difference

1616
01:43:11,661 --> 01:43:14,762
between what some people call a false belief and a false

1617
01:43:14,842 --> 01:43:18,811
memory. So I think this thing happened or I remember this thing

1618
01:43:18,902 --> 01:43:22,602
happened, and that is a really difficult differentiation

1619
01:43:22,642 --> 01:43:26,241
often because all we have as social psychologists is what you're telling

1620
01:43:26,281 --> 01:43:29,982
me. And I can ask you, "Do you think it really happened or not? Do you

1621
01:43:30,022 --> 01:43:33,982
believe it really happened?" But it's really hard to differentiate,

1622
01:43:34,022 --> 01:43:37,611
and so I've always thought that you need to ask people about the specifics, like, "All right, how

1623
01:43:37,701 --> 01:43:41,501
confident are you in this memory? All right, do you feel things in this memory? Does it

1624
01:43:41,581 --> 01:43:46,000
feel like other kinds of mem?" Right? Sort of, like, describe the nature of this

1625
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:49,880
experience rather than being like, "Do you think this is a real memory?" Because

1626
01:43:49,902 --> 01:43:52,701
that's a hard thing to ask people to do.

1627
01:43:52,741 --> 01:43:56,382
- So you want to get indirectly as many signals as possible to show that they

1628
01:43:56,501 --> 01:43:58,501
actually believe the thing happened.

1629
01:43:58,562 --> 01:44:02,530
- Or that it approximates a memory in their minds. That's right, rather than just a thing

1630
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,639
they think kind of sort of happened.

1631
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:08,429
But other people think that it's an easier to differentiate line. So for me, that

1632
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,670
it's almost impossible to differentiate the two. Other people think it's more

1633
01:44:11,710 --> 01:44:15,230
clear. And then in terms of the frequency, so in my

1634
01:44:15,269 --> 01:44:18,660
research, 70% of people became convinced that

1635
01:44:18,690 --> 01:44:22,570
they committed a crime that never happened or experienced another important

1636
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:26,089
emotional event. And that number as well

1637
01:44:26,190 --> 01:44:29,589
is challenged in that people go, "Well, does that mean that 70% of

1638
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:33,150
people can have false memories like this?" And the answer is

1639
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:37,130
no, obviously not. That's just in my sample. That's just these specific six

1640
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:40,670
false memories. And it could be that I think 100% of

1641
01:44:40,710 --> 01:44:44,469
people are prone to some version of this, just maybe not in this

1642
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:48,230
specific study, right? That if I had to come up with different false

1643
01:44:48,269 --> 01:44:52,070
memories to implant, or if I was a different person myself and people trusted me

1644
01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:55,870
differently. There are again, those social factors that make it more or

1645
01:44:55,969 --> 01:44:59,950
less likely that I'm going to be able to convince you that something happened in your life that you can't

1646
01:44:59,969 --> 01:45:03,940
remember. And in one study, obviously, I can't capture that. But it also

1647
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:07,630
doesn't mean that 70% of the time people are, you know, it might be 1% of the time or

1648
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:10,190
0.1% of the time that people have these complex false memories.

1649
01:45:10,250 --> 01:45:13,990
- I guess you're just speaking to the fact that you don't know how representative the sample

1650
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:19,290
is. But even from one study, that's a crazy, that's incredible.

1651
01:45:19,330 --> 01:45:19,650
- Well, it's not

1652
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:19,820
- That's a-

1653
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:23,380
- ...just representativeness. It's also that we shouldn't take individual studies in that

1654
01:45:23,389 --> 01:45:23,910
way.

1655
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:24,299
- Sure.

1656
01:45:24,309 --> 01:45:27,389
- Like I'm not saying that 70% of people always have false memories either. Like it's

1657
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:31,190
it just means in this one study, more people than not developed these

1658
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:31,849
complex memories.

1659
01:45:31,910 --> 01:45:35,880
- What was the methodology for implanting the false memories? This is so cool,

1660
01:45:35,889 --> 01:45:39,530
by the way. Human memory is so

1661
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:42,969
fascinating, and the fact that we can engineer memory--

1662
01:45:43,549 --> 01:45:43,820
- It's good that it's fast.

1663
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:47,170
- ...it's so interesting. It's also really interesting that we live so much of our lives in

1664
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:54,089
memories. And that you can mess with that, you can shape it. It's interesting.

1665
01:45:54,150 --> 01:45:56,690
- It's mostly, I think, a good thing that we can shape it.

1666
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:57,500
- I think so. Yeah.

1667
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:04,290
- I think the fact that memory can be false in the way that I do it in my study is a

1668
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:08,110
result of the fact that our minds are made to creatively recombine

1669
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:11,230
information to solve problems in the

1670
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:15,130
And so even the fact that we have this gist memory,

1671
01:46:15,190 --> 01:46:18,710
it's because we're optimizing data processing. We're

1672
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:22,570
basically saying, "These are the most important things from these events,

1673
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:26,530
and the other details are irrelevant. Don't remember that. Gone.

1674
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:30,490
And now I'm going to work with that to try and solve what life comes up with."

1675
01:46:30,549 --> 01:46:34,290
And the ability to be creative and intelligent relies on our

1676
01:46:34,330 --> 01:46:37,990
ability to take memories from the past and pieces of them and to creatively

1677
01:46:38,049 --> 01:46:41,410
recombine them. And so that's what false memories are, except that that then

1678
01:46:42,089 --> 01:46:45,938
can look bad if you're trying to remember something specific.

1679
01:46:45,969 --> 01:46:49,910
And so in my research, I used leading and suggestive questions like, "Close

1680
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:53,410
your eyes. Picture the event that I'm trying to implant." So I was

1681
01:46:53,589 --> 01:46:57,330
implanting, for example, "You're 14 years old. You

1682
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:01,389
were in contact with the police. The police called your parents,

1683
01:47:01,969 --> 01:47:05,589
and you assaulted someone with a weapon." And then the question

1684
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:09,620
is, "What do you remember?" And you say to me as a

1685
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:13,240
participant, because you've been selected out to specifically never having had this experience...

1686
01:47:13,250 --> 01:47:16,910
And just to be clear, a weapon, I don't mean a semi-automatic weapon.

1687
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:20,710
I mean anything. And usually it was a rock. And so people would say, "I found..."

1688
01:47:20,769 --> 01:47:24,509
'Cause a weapon is just anything you use to hurt another person.

1689
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:28,089
And I did this study in Canada. We don't have guns in the same way

1690
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:32,099
as in some other parts of the world. And so it was unlikely that my participants would have been like,

1691
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:35,570
"Yeah, I totally have all these guns." And so they would take something,

1692
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:39,269
an object, and hurt somebody else, or they stole something, or they hit somebody.

1693
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:42,460
So those are three of the conditions. And I randomly assigned people to them,

1694
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:47,330
and they knew that I contacted their loved ones ahead of time, so they

1695
01:47:47,349 --> 01:47:51,190
were participating in a childhood memory study, an emotional

1696
01:47:51,290 --> 01:47:55,170
childhood memory study, and they knew that. And then I contacted their parents

1697
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:59,110
ahead of time to get information about what they were like as teenagers,

1698
01:47:59,150 --> 01:48:04,009
where they lived, friends, basic things, and to make sure they hadn't ever experienced any of the target events.

1699
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:07,830
And then with that information, I said to the participants, "Okay, so there's these two things your parents

1700
01:48:07,870 --> 01:48:11,780
reported happening, and one of them is a true one." And so I'd

1701
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:15,740
always include a true one to build rapport, which is, "I'm doing

1702
01:48:15,769 --> 01:48:17,530
the what not to do of interviewing, right?"

1703
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:17,950
- Right.

1704
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:20,009
- I'm laying it on thick.

1705
01:48:20,049 --> 01:48:20,870
- To see what's possible.

1706
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:24,230
- To see what's possible. Because you have to push it to also show that it's

1707
01:48:24,929 --> 01:48:28,129
that I can do this in this context so that we can warn police to not do

1708
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:32,049
this. So I said, "We have these two incidents that your parents reported,

1709
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:35,809
and one of them was you had a skiing accident," blah, blah, blah.

1710
01:48:35,849 --> 01:48:39,299
one. The second one was an incident where you were in contact with the police, but we'll get to

1711
01:48:39,349 --> 01:48:42,889
that." So we'd first have 20 minutes talking about the true

1712
01:48:42,929 --> 01:48:46,429
memory, which people, you know, they're getting going. It feels good.

1713
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:50,450
I've got a structured interview as well, which I'll then mirror in the false memory.

1714
01:48:50,549 --> 01:48:54,509
So it all feels very legit. And then we get to the second memory, and I

1715
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:58,170
say this, you know, I... "There's this other important memory that your parents

1716
01:48:58,190 --> 01:49:02,009
recalled." And then they'd say, "I don't remember that." And I'd say, "Oh, okay.

1717
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:05,910
But I have this really detailed account. All you have to do is remember it."

1718
01:49:05,950 --> 01:49:09,440
And then I would do the illusion of transparency, which is a really powerful

1719
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:13,280
psychological tool, which is to make people feel like they know what's going on when they don't really.

1720
01:49:13,349 --> 01:49:17,190
And the thing I would do is just say, "Well, you know, if you want

1721
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:21,049
to, we can do this memory retrieval technique called

1722
01:49:21,349 --> 01:49:25,070
this imagination exercise." And I don't like to call it repression, but

1723
01:49:25,110 --> 01:49:29,049
sometimes we hide away memories that we don't like about ourselves. And I'm using words that

1724
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:32,730
people know and mechanisms that people have heard of that are frankly quite

1725
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:36,650
disputed in actual science. But people go, "Oh, well, maybe I did

1726
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:40,679
repress this." And then everybody says yes. Like technically they could say no.

1727
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:44,679
They can say, "No, I don't want to do that." But they go, "Yeah, of course I want to know." And so I do this

1728
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:48,500
imagination exercise where people close their eyes, very simple, and just imagine what could have

1729
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:52,389
happened, basically. And every time they say a detail, my very first

1730
01:49:52,410 --> 01:49:56,330
detail ever, I remember this because I was so excited 'cause they've got their eyes

1731
01:49:56,349 --> 01:50:00,309
closed, right? And I'm right next to the head of department because they were worried 'cause I was a

1732
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:03,670
PhD student... that, you know, the ethics of it, the consequences.

1733
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:06,410
Like it took years to get the protocol through ethics and-

1734
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:09,410
...to make sure it was safe. Anyway, I'm s- I'm

1735
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:13,718
grinning as the person with their eyes closed says the most trivial detail,

1736
01:50:14,638 --> 01:50:21,157
"I remember a blue sky." And I remember going, "It's working."

1737
01:50:21,258 --> 01:50:22,638
- Did you know it was going to happen at all?

1738
01:50:22,698 --> 01:50:24,028
- Oh, no, I had no idea. I had no idea.

1739
01:50:24,038 --> 01:50:25,258
- That's so fascinating.

1740
01:50:25,278 --> 01:50:28,508
- And so from the trivial details, and I'd always say, "Yeah, good job, good job."

1741
01:50:28,718 --> 01:50:32,698
You know, social reinforcement, little treat. And they

1742
01:50:32,758 --> 01:50:36,598
would remember more and more details, and then they'd get more specific, and then they'd tell

1743
01:50:36,638 --> 01:50:40,228
me who it was they allegedly attacked or stole from, where they

1744
01:50:40,298 --> 01:50:44,058
were. And those details had to come from them because I don't know enough about their lives, right?

1745
01:50:44,118 --> 01:50:47,928
So this is the other thing with false memories; it's basing it on lots of real pieces of

1746
01:50:47,958 --> 01:50:51,938
memories, real places, real people, real feelings. They're just woven together in a way

1747
01:50:51,958 --> 01:50:55,918
that never happened. And so just three interviews and you've got 70%

1748
01:50:55,938 --> 01:50:58,078
of people confessing to a crime that never happened.

1749
01:50:58,138 --> 01:51:01,958
- First of all, great study. Great, great job all around. To what

1750
01:51:02,018 --> 01:51:05,878
degree has this been elaborated on and proven further

1751
01:51:06,378 --> 01:51:11,638
since? Because it's a super powerful idea, whether it's 70% or any kind of percent.

1752
01:51:11,678 --> 01:51:13,978
- What I wanted with the study is just to show it's possible.

1753
01:51:14,038 --> 01:51:16,998
- That's really the powerful thing, that it's possible.

1754
01:51:17,058 --> 01:51:20,618
- Right. And so it could've been two people and I would've been happy. The fact that it

1755
01:51:20,698 --> 01:51:24,198
was so possible was frankly quite surprising to everybody.

1756
01:51:24,298 --> 01:51:28,178
And we did in fact cut the study short 'cause we told ethics that we're only going to have like a

1757
01:51:28,198 --> 01:51:32,818
13% hit rate. We were like, "This is working really well. We're gonna stop."

1758
01:51:32,938 --> 01:51:36,538
So, and that was just because of, you know, how

1759
01:51:36,578 --> 01:51:38,878
power calculations, whatever. Science.

1760
01:51:38,898 --> 01:51:46,038
Because science. And since then there have been other studies on implanting false

1761
01:51:46,078 --> 01:51:49,898
memories. There have been ones also using AI tools, so like whether or

1762
01:51:49,958 --> 01:51:53,258
not we remember or think we remember

1763
01:51:53,318 --> 01:51:57,308
incidents differently or better if they were created with

1764
01:51:57,318 --> 01:52:01,138
AI images of ourselves or videos. So, there was a study that came out,

1765
01:52:01,378 --> 01:52:05,268
I think it was this year, by a team including Elizabeth

1766
01:52:05,268 --> 01:52:09,078
Loftus, which showed that if you turn photos of yourself into videos

1767
01:52:09,798 --> 01:52:13,788
using AI, that you are more likely to believe those things happened in the way that AI is

1768
01:52:13,838 --> 01:52:17,698
telling you that they did, even though AI has absolutely no idea. And then,

1769
01:52:17,758 --> 01:52:21,718
you are more likely to remember it with high confidence that it happened in the

1770
01:52:21,758 --> 01:52:25,248
way that this AI has created it. And so, we can see that there's

1771
01:52:26,098 --> 01:52:29,998
lots of versions of this, whether it's in interpersonal social interactions

1772
01:52:30,058 --> 01:52:33,688
or interactions with tech. And there's a big replication

1773
01:52:33,758 --> 01:52:37,738
that's happening right now at the University of Maastricht of my study, or is

1774
01:52:37,748 --> 01:52:39,698
about to happen, hopefully actually, is where we're at.

1775
01:52:40,118 --> 01:52:43,958
- There's a lot of questions I want to ask you. Like one of them, doesn't this mean that

1776
01:52:44,038 --> 01:52:47,438
at scale you could have something like a government

1777
01:52:48,258 --> 01:52:58,798
use propaganda to mass gaslight a population? So, implant false memories using AI,

1778
01:52:58,868 --> 01:53:01,918
using, using whatever tools they have?

1779
01:53:01,998 --> 01:53:05,718
- Yes. That is definitely already happening.

1780
01:53:06,338 --> 01:53:09,838
- That's terrifying. Is there any- anything you've learned about

1781
01:53:09,847 --> 01:53:13,198
defending against that?

1782
01:53:13,278 --> 01:53:16,758
I guess knowing that first step is just knowing that it's possible. That's

1783
01:53:16,818 --> 01:53:19,618
already a very powerful piece of knowledge.

1784
01:53:19,658 --> 01:53:23,418
- That's right. So, the first thing that's important is for people to understand that they

1785
01:53:23,458 --> 01:53:27,238
are capable of creating these false memories, and that they're not this really

1786
01:53:27,278 --> 01:53:30,578
unusual, hard-to-generate thing. They're actually a normal memory

1787
01:53:30,638 --> 01:53:34,538
process. And that insight is why I wrote The Memory Illusion, is

1788
01:53:34,558 --> 01:53:38,538
because I think people need to just understand that their minds work like this, and that they're

1789
01:53:38,578 --> 01:53:42,198
really glitchy when it comes to the accuracy of their autobiographical

1790
01:53:42,218 --> 01:53:46,108
memories. But again, that that's probably ultimately a good thing as well in

1791
01:53:46,118 --> 01:53:49,978
terms of our overall human experience. But then,

1792
01:53:50,058 --> 01:53:54,048
what happens if you do have an important piece of information that's important and not

1793
01:53:54,058 --> 01:53:57,968
being distorted, right? You are a witness of a crime, for example,

1794
01:53:57,978 --> 01:54:01,698
and you now know that this is going to be important. What do you do? And the really

1795
01:54:01,738 --> 01:54:05,488
simple answer is don't trust your brain. Just make sure you write it down.

1796
01:54:05,538 --> 01:54:09,398
Assume you are going to forget everything. Assume you're going to

1797
01:54:09,418 --> 01:54:13,318
forget no matter how important, how emotional, how intense, how

1798
01:54:13,338 --> 01:54:17,298
much you say to yourself. This is a failure of prospective memory, it's called.

1799
01:54:17,378 --> 01:54:20,458
"I will remember." You won't. Just assume that you're not going to remember.

1800
01:54:20,498 --> 01:54:24,458
And the closer you get to the time

1801
01:54:24,558 --> 01:54:28,178
at which an event happened, and we call this contemporaneous evidence,

1802
01:54:28,738 --> 01:54:32,588
the closer you get in time, the more high-quality that memory is going to be. And I think

1803
01:54:32,618 --> 01:54:36,448
there's this myth sometimes that if you're drunk or if you're high or if you're really

1804
01:54:36,478 --> 01:54:40,398
emotional, that somehow you should wait. You should sort of like

1805
01:54:40,978 --> 01:54:44,858
go home, sleep it off, and then recall your memory.

1806
01:54:44,918 --> 01:54:48,548
is not what the current advice in memory research actually says. It's

1807
01:54:49,238 --> 01:54:53,178
in the moment, as soon as possible, write it down, record it outside your brain.

1808
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:57,338
You can do it again when you wake up, but then at least you have an original version.

1809
01:54:57,378 --> 01:55:01,288
- Yeah. You used the analogy of a Wikipedia page for memory. I think that's a pretty

1810
01:55:01,378 --> 01:55:05,238
useful way to think about it. It's kind of crowdsourced by all the

1811
01:55:05,278 --> 01:55:09,198
different influences you have, all the different experiences, all the

1812
01:55:09,278 --> 01:55:13,188
other people, you telling other people about the memory, that

1813
01:55:13,238 --> 01:55:18,518
all of that edits the page, the Wikipedia page of your memory.

1814
01:55:18,588 --> 01:55:22,398
- It does. And collective and individual memory are these

1815
01:55:22,418 --> 01:55:26,408
really interesting... They interact in a really interesting way. So I would always

1816
01:55:26,458 --> 01:55:30,298
say when I train, for example, people who go

1817
01:55:30,378 --> 01:55:34,258
to deal with warlords in the German military.

1818
01:55:34,378 --> 01:55:38,238
I was working with agents who were going abroad and who were

1819
01:55:38,418 --> 01:55:42,138
in these really difficult situations where they had to remember a lot of information that was

1820
01:55:42,178 --> 01:55:45,718
important for national security. They couldn't just sit there with a tape recorder being like,

1821
01:55:45,998 --> 01:55:49,638
"Hey," or like, their phone, being like, "Hey, Mister Warlord, can you just talk into this a bit

1822
01:55:49,658 --> 01:55:53,478
closer?" You can't do that. And so you have to remember it. And so what they were

1823
01:55:53,518 --> 01:55:56,858
doing is they were coming back from their deployments,

1824
01:55:57,338 --> 01:56:01,298
and they would meet up immediately and have a team meeting, could be like, "What did you

1825
01:56:01,318 --> 01:56:05,258
remember? What happened?" And the problem is that they would do that before writing their

1826
01:56:05,278 --> 01:56:09,258
notes, and that is, that is the wrong way around. And so

1827
01:56:09,318 --> 01:56:13,138
they don't do that anymore because I've told them not to do that anymore. But it

1828
01:56:13,238 --> 01:56:17,198
feels good. It feels like collectively, we are going to remember more details.

1829
01:56:17,218 --> 01:56:20,938
Because you do, but it doesn't mean that those details are right. And so

1830
01:56:20,998 --> 01:56:24,038
that's where I'd always say have your own version before you talk to

1831
01:56:24,058 --> 01:56:27,902
anybody. Then, and my colleague, Dr.

1832
01:56:27,922 --> 01:56:31,622
Annalise Fredevelt, is one of the experts on the effect of things like eye

1833
01:56:31,722 --> 01:56:35,382
closure on memory and collective memory, and she has

1834
01:56:35,422 --> 01:56:38,302
found, repeatedly, that if you remember things

1835
01:56:38,342 --> 01:56:42,302
together, especially if you've already got an original version of your own, you

1836
01:56:42,342 --> 01:56:46,312
do usually remember more details. And especially if you are helping each other

1837
01:56:46,322 --> 01:56:50,222
to remember, like in a relationship. You'll have someone who's better at remembering certain kinds of

1838
01:56:50,262 --> 01:56:53,822
details, maybe names or what happened or what you were

1839
01:56:53,862 --> 01:56:57,762
doing, and the other person's better at when it happened. And so you can have

1840
01:56:57,802 --> 01:57:01,362
these complementary memories that come in in social situations,

1841
01:57:01,422 --> 01:57:05,002
and you can then have more details that are remembered after.

1842
01:57:05,042 --> 01:57:08,422
- Right, but there are conflicting forces here. So that's true, but also as you

1843
01:57:08,502 --> 01:57:12,182
said, it's true that together, you can weave a

1844
01:57:12,342 --> 01:57:15,062
narrative that never happened. So together, you can

1845
01:57:15,822 --> 01:57:19,552
solidify the thing that actually happened, maybe if you take notes

1846
01:57:19,582 --> 01:57:23,462
beforehand. But at the same time, if you don't take notes, then you can

1847
01:57:23,522 --> 01:57:27,382
just make things up very effectively together because you're like, yes, ending the whole

1848
01:57:27,422 --> 01:57:32,122
time, like building together a castle that's false.

1849
01:57:32,202 --> 01:57:33,122
- Or distorted.

1850
01:57:33,162 --> 01:57:33,942
- Distorted.

1851
01:57:34,002 --> 01:57:37,962
- Yeah. But you can also sometimes go back to your original account and go, "Actually, no, that,

1852
01:57:38,002 --> 01:57:41,202
that was a bit wrong." And so my,

1853
01:57:42,102 --> 01:57:45,502
as again, an analytical person and someone who works as an expert witness on memory

1854
01:57:45,582 --> 01:57:49,522
cases, I just want to see all the versions. I want your version history. I

1855
01:57:49,562 --> 01:57:53,402
want the complete version history of your memory, and then I can tell you whether I think things have

1856
01:57:53,422 --> 01:57:55,252
gone wrong here. And if so, why?

1857
01:57:55,302 --> 01:58:01,382
- Have you seen like different versions of memory and they're really conflicting?

1858
01:58:01,402 --> 01:58:05,302
Like what have you learned about memory from that, that they

1859
01:58:05,322 --> 01:58:08,552
can be very conflicting? People explain the same experience as very different.

1860
01:58:09,062 --> 01:58:12,592
- Well, there's different people having very different memories of the same experience.

1861
01:58:12,602 --> 01:58:16,362
And there's the same person having different memories of the same experience. And so

1862
01:58:16,542 --> 01:58:19,962
I work in both, in some ways, as an expert witness, but

1863
01:58:20,262 --> 01:58:23,962
mostly in the individual changing their story in a dramatic way.

1864
01:58:24,062 --> 01:58:24,872
- Ah, yeah.

1865
01:58:24,922 --> 01:58:28,022
- So a witness or an alleged victim saying that

1866
01:58:28,142 --> 01:58:31,732
they, you know, having X story the first time they go to the

1867
01:58:31,782 --> 01:58:35,102
police, and then three years later, having a very different, sometimes

1868
01:58:35,162 --> 01:58:38,272
categorically different account. And the question is

1869
01:58:39,222 --> 01:58:42,242
are they just, were they just too shy initially to say what really

1870
01:58:42,282 --> 01:58:45,842
happened? Were they, were they under pressure from other

1871
01:58:45,962 --> 01:58:49,402
people? Were they not really remembering? You know, why has it

1872
01:58:49,442 --> 01:58:52,562
changed? Or could it be that they have been

1873
01:58:53,182 --> 01:58:56,682
undergone some really problematic like hypnotherapy or

1874
01:58:57,262 --> 01:59:01,042
just shady therapy in general that has like convinced them that things are maybe much

1875
01:59:01,082 --> 01:59:04,751
worse than they initially remembered? And it's not that therapy doesn't nec-

1876
01:59:04,982 --> 01:59:08,852
Like therapy can bring out more details, for sure, but the problem is

1877
01:59:08,882 --> 01:59:12,322
that certain kinds of therapy mirror what we do in false memory research in terms of

1878
01:59:12,362 --> 01:59:15,762
implanting false memories, and it just makes it really messy and you just

1879
01:59:16,202 --> 01:59:19,502
... It makes the quality of the evidence really low because we can no longer

1880
01:59:19,542 --> 01:59:22,562
tell what is because of the therapy and what's actually remembered.

1881
01:59:22,602 --> 01:59:26,582
- This is so fascinating. What are the ways you can possibly figure out which is true, the

1882
01:59:26,622 --> 01:59:31,282
thing you remembered initially or the thing you're now remembering four years later?

1883
01:59:31,342 --> 01:59:35,132
- Receipts. That's all you got. You have to look at your original versions. If you only

1884
01:59:35,222 --> 01:59:38,982
have your version now, the only thing you can look for is evidence that

1885
01:59:39,042 --> 01:59:43,022
confirms or shows that it didn't happen. If you can't

1886
01:59:43,102 --> 01:59:47,002
access that, then it ultimately is a matter of, especially if you've got like two people

1887
01:59:47,062 --> 01:59:50,552
saying completely different things, it ends up being a battle of confidence

1888
01:59:50,662 --> 01:59:51,502
ultimately.

1889
01:59:51,542 --> 01:59:55,062
- This is a tricky question, but you mentioned therapy.

1890
01:59:56,062 --> 01:59:58,402
It does seem like what therapists do

1891
02:00:00,102 --> 02:00:03,822
is they want to find a problem, and they can then just project the

1892
02:00:03,902 --> 02:00:07,602
problem and then convince you the problem existed. So how do you

1893
02:00:07,642 --> 02:00:11,531
know... Is like therapy even an effective... It takes

1894
02:00:11,642 --> 02:00:17,122
a very special therapist not to implant, right? A trauma that never happened or, or

1895
02:00:19,062 --> 02:00:22,102
details that never happened to a trauma that did.

1896
02:00:22,162 --> 02:00:25,962
- It depends on the kind of therapy. So there's a lot of therapy that is evidence-based and that

1897
02:00:25,982 --> 02:00:29,562
is very much focused on tackling sort of feelings and

1898
02:00:29,642 --> 02:00:31,502
reactions that you have right now.

1899
02:00:32,522 --> 02:00:36,512
Then there is an area or a bunch of areas of therapy, including

1900
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:41,702
psychoanalysis, which are very focused on trying to find

1901
02:00:41,762 --> 02:00:49,302
retroactively sources of mental illness in your personal past. And I

1902
02:00:49,362 --> 02:00:52,422
am very critical of the kinds

1903
02:00:52,482 --> 02:00:56,342
of... Well, both from an explanatory perspective, but also

1904
02:00:56,362 --> 02:01:00,042
from a false memory perspective. I don't think that we are the way we are because of

1905
02:01:00,082 --> 02:01:03,842
individual incidents that happened to us. I think that is a wild thing to think about the

1906
02:01:03,862 --> 02:01:07,362
brain. Like to be like you, you are the way you are because of this one

1907
02:01:07,422 --> 02:01:11,142
interaction you had that one time is like... I mean, maybe this explains a

1908
02:01:11,182 --> 02:01:14,672
tiny bit of you, but what about all the other life experiences you have every single day?

1909
02:01:14,722 --> 02:01:18,582
And so I think that there's sometimes an oversimplified searching for answers or sources of problems that we have that

1910
02:01:18,642 --> 02:01:20,532
sources of problems that we have that

1911
02:01:21,342 --> 02:01:25,202
I don't like. I don't think it's true. And I think that there can be an uncautious approach to memory,

1912
02:01:25,262 --> 02:01:30,082
as you were saying, where you have someone who is

1913
02:01:31,022 --> 02:01:34,762
saying things and your role as a therapist is to help them manage their

1914
02:01:34,782 --> 02:01:38,262
emotions now and to feel better. That's the other thing is that they have a very different role than I

1915
02:01:38,302 --> 02:01:42,032
do. A therapist is trying to manage the person's well-being now.

1916
02:01:42,402 --> 02:01:46,282
whereas I am looking at the evidentiary quality. That is a complete... I'm almost like the

1917
02:01:46,322 --> 02:01:48,842
not quite the other side, but I'm in a very different role.

1918
02:01:48,982 --> 02:01:50,722
- Well, you just want the truth.

1919
02:01:50,762 --> 02:01:54,622
- Well, I'm criticizing and analyzing their memories,

1920
02:01:54,642 --> 02:01:58,502
whereas the others, the therapists, are more likely to be trying to help them manage the memories in their

1921
02:01:58,622 --> 02:02:02,572
day-to-day life. And so it doesn't matter if they're true or not to therapists. What matters

1922
02:02:02,622 --> 02:02:05,742
is that they're troubling to the people themselves. But once you get into a courtroom

1923
02:02:05,782 --> 02:02:07,532
setting, as you say...

1924
02:02:07,562 --> 02:02:11,322
the facts and what actually happened matter. And it's not just what you remember,

1925
02:02:11,382 --> 02:02:13,802
it's what actually happened.

1926
02:02:13,822 --> 02:02:17,572
- Maybe you can speak to the other, the non-courtroom setting, because this is

1927
02:02:17,682 --> 02:02:21,382
all... The positive side of it is you can basically shape your

1928
02:02:21,422 --> 02:02:24,082
memories to be happier.

1929
02:02:25,222 --> 02:02:29,122
I mean, I find this in myself. Maybe you could speak to that. If I, you know, look

1930
02:02:29,162 --> 02:02:33,122
into past relationships, if I just think about, or maybe speak to others about the

1931
02:02:33,162 --> 02:02:37,130
positive things... really think. Just think, like,

1932
02:02:37,690 --> 02:02:41,450
I focus my mind on the memory, on the positive memories. And then everything just

1933
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:48,730
becomes more positive. And I think it makes me feel like I'm way happier

1934
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:53,309
about my past. So there must be something to that,

1935
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:57,450
'cause I almost start to forget that the negative stuff happened. And

1936
02:02:57,470 --> 02:03:01,450
then the same thing on the flip side is if you focus on the negative, then

1937
02:03:01,510 --> 02:03:03,050
the negative stuff

1938
02:03:04,309 --> 02:03:08,110
just overpowers everything else and you have a very heavy negative

1939
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:15,730
feeling about your past. So that seems, like the way to live a healthy

1940
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:19,470
life, a happy life is just to focus on the positive. Not to sound

1941
02:03:19,530 --> 02:03:23,269
cliché, but like basically modifying your memories

1942
02:03:23,330 --> 02:03:27,769
continuously that everything was just great. Is there something to that?

1943
02:03:27,809 --> 02:03:31,490
- Well, the essence of that is right. There is something called

1944
02:03:31,570 --> 02:03:35,290
state-dependent memory, which is that you're more likely to remember things that were

1945
02:03:35,389 --> 02:03:38,650
consolidated or created as memories

1946
02:03:39,809 --> 02:03:44,690
if they match the state that you're in now. So if you are sad now

1947
02:03:45,490 --> 02:03:49,430
and your brain's just sort of going, you're more likely to remember

1948
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:53,470
other sad times because your memory and the emotional state of your brain is basically

1949
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:57,430
already activating those networks of sadness. And it's like,

1950
02:03:57,450 --> 02:04:01,410
here are some other sad things and shitty things that happened to you. And it's the same

1951
02:04:01,470 --> 02:04:05,349
with if you are embarrassed. That's the classic one that we usually use as memory

1952
02:04:05,410 --> 02:04:09,370
researchers, is that moment where you do something embarrassing and for the next like

1953
02:04:09,769 --> 02:04:13,710
six hours, all you're thinking of is all the other embarrassing things you've ever done.

1954
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:16,860
And it's like your brain is like, "Would you like some other embarrassing stories?"

1955
02:04:17,610 --> 02:04:21,250
And obviously you're going, "No, thank you. Please stop," but

1956
02:04:21,570 --> 02:04:25,389
you have this spreading activation, as it's called, of

1957
02:04:25,470 --> 02:04:29,400
just these synapses, just lighting up new networks, and you're going, "Ah!"

1958
02:04:29,410 --> 02:04:33,360
And there's this other memory that's attached to the same feeling. So it's the

1959
02:04:33,450 --> 02:04:37,210
same with happiness, is that people who are happier tend to remember more happy

1960
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:40,900
memories. So most of the time, unless you're depressed, most people

1961
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:44,570
look back at their lives with a rosy reminiscence bias.

1962
02:04:45,169 --> 02:04:48,910
They're more likely to remember the positives than the negatives. But it's not

1963
02:04:48,950 --> 02:04:52,870
quite the way you were describing it. It's not quite that you only remember the

1964
02:04:53,010 --> 02:04:56,670
good, the objectively good things that happened. It's more that your

1965
02:04:56,710 --> 02:05:00,670
interpretation of the things that you've experienced is either neutral or

1966
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:04,010
positive. For me, for example, growing up with

1967
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:07,809
my father with apparent schizophrenia, that is

1968
02:05:07,849 --> 02:05:10,959
something that I see as a net positive.

1969
02:05:11,790 --> 02:05:15,470
So obviously at the time, it was experienced in a complicated way,

1970
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:19,370
but in hindsight, it defined my life and it completely gave me a perspective of the

1971
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:23,239
human mind that I just wouldn't have had otherwise. So I see that

1972
02:05:23,309 --> 02:05:27,300
as a positive part of my autobiography, and that is what

1973
02:05:27,670 --> 02:05:31,160
good therapy should be doing. It should be taking negative experiences and not

1974
02:05:31,230 --> 02:05:34,639
overwriting them or changing them. Our brains do that naturally anyway.

1975
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:37,970
But trying to work with what you've got, the experiences, the true

1976
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:41,830
experiences, but then just shifting the emotional content so

1977
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:45,490
that how you're dealing with them now is good.

1978
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:51,269
- How much of what this Daniel Kahneman type of idea is, that we live

1979
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:55,330
a lot of our life in memory? Like,

1980
02:05:55,990 --> 02:05:59,790
it's not, you know, there's the direct in the moment

1981
02:05:59,809 --> 02:06:03,670
experience of a thing, and then there's remembering that thing

1982
02:06:03,769 --> 02:06:07,730
over and over and over and over. So there's like, I don't know, getting married

1983
02:06:07,769 --> 02:06:13,690
or whatever, like some pleasant thing that if you, over a lifetime, the pleasure you

1984
02:06:13,730 --> 02:06:17,610
derive from that thing is disproportionately, most of it

1985
02:06:17,670 --> 02:06:22,370
is from remembering the thing we're experiencing it. Is there something to that?

1986
02:06:22,430 --> 02:06:25,860
- I think so. And his experiments where he asked participants if they

1987
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:29,269
were offered this holiday that they could go on--

1988
02:06:29,309 --> 02:06:32,889
...but they wouldn't remember it. So they'd have the present-day experience of

1989
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:36,809
enjoyment on this holiday, I think it was a tropical vacation or something that

1990
02:06:36,830 --> 02:06:41,690
he'd offer people. And he then said, "Well, but you're not going to be able to

1991
02:06:41,710 --> 02:06:45,660
remember this. Would you still go?" And a lot of people say, "No, I wouldn't go

1992
02:06:45,660 --> 02:06:49,459
on that holiday if I can't remember it." I think that's interesting, and I think that

1993
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:54,670
sort of "pics or it didn't happen", so that the social media generation obviously

1994
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:58,349
is perhaps even more in line with that, also in terms of how

1995
02:06:58,430 --> 02:07:02,420
you deal with that in a social context. Sharing those memories with others and

1996
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:06,309
those experiences and which experiences end up being the important ones

1997
02:07:06,349 --> 02:07:06,960
in our lives.

1998
02:07:07,110 --> 02:07:09,530
- Yeah, there's a real case to be made. There's this kind of

1999
02:07:10,370 --> 02:07:14,309
ridiculous thing that happens now whenever something cool is happening.

2000
02:07:14,330 --> 02:07:17,700
People take out their phones and film it. But the case for that is that, yeah, this

2001
02:07:17,790 --> 02:07:22,980
gives you something to look back at. So it's worthwhile to take a picture, actually.

2002
02:07:22,990 --> 02:07:26,530
- Although it's even more worthwhile to pay attention. Attention is the glue between reality and

2003
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:30,130
memory. And so if you're using your phone to not have to pay

2004
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:33,879
attention and not have to put any work into remembering it, then you're going to look at that

2005
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:35,240
picture later and go, "What was this?"

2006
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,530
'Cause you've tried to outsource it in a way that our brains don't work.

2007
02:07:39,769 --> 02:07:43,730
- How hard is it to modify memories from a neuroscience

2008
02:07:43,740 --> 02:07:47,650
perspective? So if you look at brain-computer interfaces like Neuralink,

2009
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:51,660
for example, do you think there's a future where we're implanting

2010
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:55,070
or modifying memories directly?

2011
02:07:55,110 --> 02:07:59,070
- Yeah, I mean, that's basically what we do as human beings already, and I don't

2012
02:07:59,090 --> 02:08:01,200
see why tech couldn't do exactly the same thing.

2013
02:08:01,290 --> 02:08:04,370
- Just speed that up. So right now, we could do that with language, right?

2014
02:08:04,379 --> 02:08:07,550
We just talk to each other and modify them, and we just speed that up.

2015
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:11,510
- Language, but also thinking about it yourself. So you can, it's called autosuggestion when

2016
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:14,760
you suggest things to yourself that didn't happen. And that often comes

2017
02:08:14,769 --> 02:08:18,760
from reading something or seeing something or thinking about something or hearing somebody else's

2018
02:08:18,809 --> 02:08:22,670
story and going, "Did something like that happen to me?" And then you start picturing

2019
02:08:22,730 --> 02:08:26,690
it and thinking about it, in what context it could have. And then you start to basically implant

2020
02:08:26,730 --> 02:08:30,430
a false memory in yourself. And so that can happen as well. And I think with things like

2021
02:08:30,450 --> 02:08:34,010
Neuralink, it would be the same where you'd have the ability to do that.

2022
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:37,730
And, but again, I still think that this interaction between humans

2023
02:08:37,849 --> 02:08:40,630
and AI or AI-like systems

2024
02:08:41,269 --> 02:08:45,234
is... it is the same as a social interaction, which is why I was saying it's so important,

2025
02:08:45,254 --> 02:08:48,914
I think, that we have social psychologists in the room, because

2026
02:08:48,994 --> 02:08:52,374
ultimately, whether it's an AI or another person, it's the same brain that you're

2027
02:08:52,394 --> 02:08:53,154
modifying.

2028
02:08:53,214 --> 02:08:56,734
- So what you're worried about there is that you become untethered from reality, like you

2029
02:08:57,114 --> 02:09:00,913
fabricate too many details about the memory? Like, if a human is

2030
02:09:00,974 --> 02:09:04,654
interacting with AI, and the AI is telling the human what they want to hear,

2031
02:09:05,314 --> 02:09:08,414
are you worried about over time you start to just have a

2032
02:09:08,494 --> 02:09:15,434
very overly modified version of your past narrative?

2033
02:09:15,474 --> 02:09:19,774
- I'm not necessarily worried about the fact that

2034
02:09:20,954 --> 02:09:24,674
AI and generative AI can create false memories. That

2035
02:09:24,774 --> 02:09:28,684
is, again, something we've also been doing for a long time. Like modified photos is

2036
02:09:28,694 --> 02:09:31,974
something pre-AI that we had that was already messing with people's

2037
02:09:32,034 --> 02:09:35,954
minds. Even just what you have in the frame of a shot. So if you

2038
02:09:35,994 --> 02:09:39,964
take a holiday snap and you're omitting, like, a really important part of

2039
02:09:39,994 --> 02:09:43,854
what actually happened on that holiday, 'cause you're taking a picture of the nicest part and not the, you know, the garbage

2040
02:09:43,914 --> 02:09:44,914
behind you...

2041
02:09:44,923 --> 02:09:48,464
That is going to have an impact on your memory as well. And so we've... that...

2042
02:09:48,494 --> 02:09:52,074
Versions of that have always existed. And historically, if you go even further

2043
02:09:52,114 --> 02:09:55,774
back, I mean, in some ways we've never been closer to facts than we are

2044
02:09:55,854 --> 02:09:59,504
now. There's this whole idea of like, "Oh, we're living in this post-truth," or blah, blah,

2045
02:09:59,534 --> 02:10:03,524
blah. But that is not true. I mean, we didn't

2046
02:10:03,554 --> 02:10:07,424
even know how to write for a long time. We had no way of reliably

2047
02:10:07,494 --> 02:10:10,934
cataloging information, never mind the scientific method, never

2048
02:10:10,974 --> 02:10:14,614
mind reliably sharing it with one another or fact-checking

2049
02:10:14,654 --> 02:10:18,454
quickly with things like Google. So I mean, we're so close to

2050
02:10:18,474 --> 02:10:22,394
facts, but that in some ways I think is the... The worry is that we've

2051
02:10:22,434 --> 02:10:26,384
gotten comfortable feeling like we can just access things that aren't modified or that

2052
02:10:26,394 --> 02:10:29,154
are less likely to be modified, and now they're more likely to be. And that can

2053
02:10:30,054 --> 02:10:31,694
interface with our memories.

2054
02:10:31,754 --> 02:10:35,214
- So just a practical... Is there like a protocol for

2055
02:10:35,614 --> 02:10:38,994
self-modifying memories so you can live a happier life?

2056
02:10:39,034 --> 02:10:42,434
- There is, yeah. It's called cognitive restructuring. When

2057
02:10:42,494 --> 02:10:46,434
you actively, deliberately change an aspect of a

2058
02:10:46,494 --> 02:10:50,294
memory usually for some therapeutic outcome, so to be happier,

2059
02:10:50,353 --> 02:10:52,014
to be better in some way.

2060
02:10:52,054 --> 02:10:55,914
- That's really interesting, right? Not just for if you have some kind of issue, but

2061
02:10:55,974 --> 02:11:01,494
just how to have a life well lived. Right? Does that work?

2062
02:11:01,514 --> 02:11:05,464
- Yeah, it totally works. I do it all the time. Again, it's about thinking

2063
02:11:05,554 --> 02:11:09,534
about experiences you've had, positive or negative. Usually the negative are the

2064
02:11:09,574 --> 02:11:13,514
ones we need to work on more. And thinking instead of,

2065
02:11:13,534 --> 02:11:17,483
"Wow, how terrible was that?" Thinking, "What did I learn from that? What has this given

2066
02:11:17,554 --> 02:11:21,154
me that other people haven't experienced? What is it that it taught me

2067
02:11:21,214 --> 02:11:24,974
me about who are my friends? What are these insights that I've

2068
02:11:25,174 --> 02:11:29,074
won from this experience?" And so I think that is an

2069
02:11:29,114 --> 02:11:33,774
important part of resilience that we ideally need to celebrate and teach more than

2070
02:11:33,784 --> 02:11:36,914
... the opposite, which is hanging in the negatives.

2071
02:11:36,954 --> 02:11:40,674
- That's probably really good for relationships too, right? Together you form the collective

2072
02:11:40,734 --> 02:11:45,114
memory, and you work on that. You can just fabricate or

2073
02:11:45,174 --> 02:11:47,814
modify towards the positive.

2074
02:11:47,854 --> 02:11:51,714
- Well, with relationships, one of my favorite research on memories is

2075
02:11:51,834 --> 02:11:55,714
that if you ask people in relationships who does most of the

2076
02:11:55,754 --> 02:11:59,554
housework or who does most of certain things, the numbers that they give

2077
02:11:59,614 --> 02:12:03,564
you... So like someone will say, "I do 60%." The other person will say, "I do 50%,"

2078
02:12:03,574 --> 02:12:07,434
and you add them up, that's more than 100%, and that's basically

2079
02:12:07,494 --> 02:12:11,454
always the case. And o- on lots of different fronts, people will claim that they

2080
02:12:11,474 --> 02:12:15,414
do more, and if you ask them how much their partner does, they will diminish it. And so

2081
02:12:15,514 --> 02:12:19,134
one of the tips I always say for relationships in terms of memories is actually just

2082
02:12:19,334 --> 02:12:22,474
sharing what you're actually doing. So if

2083
02:12:22,514 --> 02:12:26,374
you've... Initially it feels a bit cumbersome because it's quite

2084
02:12:26,414 --> 02:12:30,384
unnatural to be like, "I've just taken out the rubbish. I've just taken out

2085
02:12:30,394 --> 02:12:33,814
the bins," or, "I've just booked us a

2086
02:12:33,854 --> 02:12:37,694
hotel." But saying it out loud means the other person is able to perceive

2087
02:12:37,754 --> 02:12:41,614
it and then can add it to sort of their internal,

2088
02:12:41,634 --> 02:12:45,494
like, star chart of how much you've done in the relationship. And they're more likely to

2089
02:12:45,574 --> 02:12:49,494
And they're more likely to actually perceive what you're contributing.

2090
02:12:49,514 --> 02:12:53,174
memories we do, and that they... "Of course she remembers that I took out the

2091
02:12:53,194 --> 02:12:56,864
bins, but not necessarily. She might not even have really perceived it. But if

2092
02:12:56,894 --> 02:13:00,574
She might not even have really perceived it. But if you're reminding each other of all the things

2093
02:13:00,594 --> 02:13:04,233
- that you're doing, it can feel more balanced over time. This memory is just so fascinating.

2094
02:13:04,274 --> 02:13:08,154
Is it possible, this is a little bit outside of the topic of false memories, but is it possible

2095
02:13:08,214 --> 02:13:12,854
to train memory? Like, what have you understood about memory? Can it be improved?

2096
02:13:12,894 --> 02:13:16,834
- Yep, it can be improved, and there are now some really

2097
02:13:16,874 --> 02:13:20,454
good brain training apps as well that can help

2098
02:13:20,534 --> 02:13:24,474
to get people to work better with attention, to

2099
02:13:24,534 --> 02:13:28,054
have N-back tests, so remember information, a couple of

2100
02:13:28,094 --> 02:13:31,754
pieces of information back. So, what did I tell you three sentences

2101
02:13:31,794 --> 02:13:34,194
ago? There's all of these kinds

2102
02:13:34,274 --> 02:13:38,254
of, well, games effectively that you can play that will in

2103
02:13:38,334 --> 02:13:41,734
fact train how your brain is using its

2104
02:13:41,774 --> 02:13:45,694
networks. There was one that was developed by researchers, including researchers at the University

2105
02:13:45,734 --> 02:13:49,614
of Bonn in Germany, and it's called NeuroNation, and that's one that

2106
02:13:49,714 --> 02:13:53,094
I like because it's all these really short games. And the idea is that

2107
02:13:53,874 --> 02:13:57,494
doing one thing, like Sudoku or whatever, the sort of classics, to train your

2108
02:13:57,514 --> 02:14:01,334
brain, that is only going to be useful up to a point because it's then the same thing

2109
02:14:01,394 --> 02:14:05,253
over and over again. And what you want to be doing is lots of different kinds of tasks

2110
02:14:05,294 --> 02:14:09,244
so that your brain has to remain flexible. And so, short and many is the answer rather

2111
02:14:09,274 --> 02:14:13,094
than one thing hard. It's almost the opposite of expertise.

2112
02:14:13,134 --> 02:14:18,214
- Yeah, so in doing this regularly, like keeping your mind sharp...

2113
02:14:20,264 --> 02:14:26,834
That's interesting. I'm terrible at remembering names.

2114
02:14:26,914 --> 02:14:27,694
- Me too.

2115
02:14:27,714 --> 02:14:29,014
- Is there a trick to doing that?

2116
02:14:29,034 --> 02:14:33,004
- I don't know 'cause I'm also terrible at remembering names. Allegedly, there are tricks

2117
02:14:33,054 --> 02:14:36,504
and it's mostly to make the information more sticky by making it a bigger network in the

2118
02:14:36,554 --> 02:14:39,666
brain. And so, usually when you hear a name—

2119
02:14:39,726 --> 02:14:42,386
especially like you and I, it's like, gone immediately.

2120
02:14:42,446 --> 02:14:42,886
- Yeah.

2121
02:14:42,906 --> 02:14:46,796
- And that's partly because... I like to think the positive of that is because we're focusing on

2122
02:14:46,826 --> 02:14:48,146
other things about the person.

2123
02:14:48,186 --> 02:14:48,696
- Right. Yes.

2124
02:14:48,696 --> 02:14:52,266
- Like, what are they like? What are they... You know, what's this next interaction going to be?

2125
02:14:52,286 --> 02:14:55,446
Maybe you're a bit nervous about what they're gonna say or what you're gonna say.

2126
02:14:55,466 --> 02:14:59,426
You're already thinking a step ahead in terms of interpreting the situation. And it's quite an

2127
02:14:59,466 --> 02:15:02,726
overwhelming situation when you first meet somebody because there's a lot to take in.

2128
02:15:02,766 --> 02:15:07,886
And so if, however, a name is important, then you need to, A,

2129
02:15:08,626 --> 02:15:12,386
remember to focus when they actually say their name and tune out the other

2130
02:15:12,446 --> 02:15:15,746
stuff, which can be really difficult. And then to give yourself a

2131
02:15:15,766 --> 02:15:22,326
mnemonic of, "How do I remember this name?" So you could have a

2132
02:15:22,366 --> 02:15:26,276
visualize something. You could have a weird word game or some sort of,

2133
02:15:26,286 --> 02:15:30,406
like, rhyme that you create for the person. You can say, you know,

2134
02:15:31,246 --> 02:15:35,106
"Julia with the big ears." Like, whatever works for you, as long as it

2135
02:15:35,166 --> 02:15:39,066
sticks. Now, there's a caveat that I recently discovered about myself

2136
02:15:39,226 --> 02:15:43,106
in terms of why I might not have... I have particularly

2137
02:15:43,166 --> 02:15:49,826
bad memory for names. All of these mnemonic devices that have

2138
02:15:50,886 --> 02:15:54,436
mostly rely on creating elaborate pictures in your mind.

2139
02:15:54,506 --> 02:15:58,146
So, like memory champions, people who do competitive remembering, will tell you that they

2140
02:15:58,226 --> 02:16:00,566
create these really elaborate images in their

2141
02:16:00,606 --> 02:16:05,606
heads. I recently discovered that I have apantasia.

2142
02:16:05,626 --> 02:16:09,556
Aphantasia is the inability to create mental imagery. And

2143
02:16:09,606 --> 02:16:12,826
so when I was trying these techniques, I was going, "None of these are working for

2144
02:16:12,866 --> 02:16:16,636
me." And it turns out it's because I don't see anything, whereas other

2145
02:16:16,646 --> 02:16:20,536
people actually see pictures in their mind. And so I think there's some

2146
02:16:20,586 --> 02:16:23,816
individual differences stuff going on there that we haven't quite understood.

2147
02:16:23,846 --> 02:16:27,576
- So you're not able to visual... Can you imagine a castle in your head and

2148
02:16:27,886 --> 02:16:28,766
look at it?

2149
02:16:28,846 --> 02:16:31,256
- No. So the memory palace idea is absurd to me.

2150
02:16:31,306 --> 02:16:32,066
- Wow.

2151
02:16:32,106 --> 02:16:35,665
- But the... So the test for aphantasia is really easy, which is close your

2152
02:16:35,745 --> 02:16:38,046
eyes and picture a red apple.

2153
02:16:38,066 --> 02:16:39,665
- You can't picture a red apple?

2154
02:16:39,706 --> 02:16:40,866
- And I just see black.

2155
02:16:42,766 --> 02:16:43,456
- Wow.

2156
02:16:43,806 --> 02:16:47,346
- Yeah. And there's a scale. So some people are hyperphantasic,

2157
02:16:47,466 --> 02:16:52,736
where they can have a really elaborate version of the apple.

2158
02:16:52,786 --> 02:16:56,504
And other people have, like, a gray sort of outline. And I have nothing.

2159
02:16:56,546 --> 02:17:00,186
- Wait. How does your memory work? If you think about a past event, are

2160
02:17:00,245 --> 02:17:04,106
you... Wait. Am I visualizing a past event, or am I just thinking about it?

2161
02:17:04,526 --> 02:17:06,436
- Oh, that's the question. Or is it just a concept?

2162
02:17:06,486 --> 02:17:09,626
- I think it might be... I might be operating in the space of concepts.

2163
02:17:09,646 --> 02:17:13,736
- Hmm. 'Cause I do, and I think that's why I'm so interested in concepts and ideas.

2164
02:17:13,736 --> 02:17:17,386
And we know that people with aphantasia are less likely to care about their childhood memories

2165
02:17:17,806 --> 02:17:18,966
because they can't visualize them.

2166
02:17:19,046 --> 02:17:21,946
- I'm trying to think if I can visualize people's faces from the past.

2167
02:17:22,004 --> 02:17:25,585
I have a feeling like I can.

2168
02:17:25,665 --> 02:17:27,126
- Ooh, but are you seeing anything?

2169
02:17:27,146 --> 02:17:30,486
- Am I actually seeing it? I don't know. I think I'm...

2170
02:17:30,786 --> 02:17:34,085
I actually reduced those people down to a few concepts about the

2171
02:17:34,126 --> 02:17:41,606
characteristics of their face, and I might be visualizing the concepts. Boy.

2172
02:17:41,686 --> 02:17:42,956
- Interesting, right?

2173
02:17:42,966 --> 02:17:46,456
And most people with aphantasia don't realize they have it until they have this kind of

2174
02:17:46,486 --> 02:17:47,726
conversation. I didn't know.

2175
02:17:47,786 --> 02:17:50,766
- I don't know if I can visualize the red apple now. Oh, boy.

2176
02:17:50,806 --> 02:17:54,786
Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I... The memory palace thing has never really worked

2177
02:17:54,806 --> 02:17:57,146
for me either. I tried. Interesting. Okay.

2178
02:17:57,226 --> 02:18:00,806
- I have a hypothesis that people who are analytical are more likely

2179
02:18:00,886 --> 02:18:04,745
to... I think it intersects with other things. 'Cause a lot of my

2180
02:18:04,806 --> 02:18:08,726
friends, it turns out, have aphantasia, and I think it's... There's a version of intelligence,

2181
02:18:08,745 --> 02:18:12,375
I think, that it might be related to, or an interest in certain kinds of

2182
02:18:12,406 --> 02:18:15,986
concepts that it's related to. But I don't know-

2183
02:18:16,004 --> 02:18:16,016
- I'm going to... Okay.

2184
02:18:16,016 --> 02:18:18,106
- 'cause it's early days of research on this.

2185
02:18:18,146 --> 02:18:21,504
- All right. This conversation totally is leading me to do some soul-searching on many

2186
02:18:21,606 --> 02:18:25,386
fronts. You have done incredible work

2187
02:18:25,446 --> 02:18:29,085
across a number of disciplines. I mean, from sexuality to

2188
02:18:29,346 --> 02:18:33,136
evil to memory, and now in your upcoming

2189
02:18:33,286 --> 02:18:37,245
book, Green Crime: Inside the Minds of the People Destroying the Planet

2190
02:18:37,266 --> 02:18:40,905
and How to Stop Them. Can you speak to the psychology

2191
02:18:41,085 --> 02:18:44,745
of the people, the organizations, that are killing Earth, as you

2192
02:18:44,786 --> 02:18:48,726
describe, including illegal gold miners, animal traffickers, con men

2193
02:18:48,806 --> 02:18:54,606
who falsify data and bribe regulators to keep polluting, and many other types

2194
02:18:54,646 --> 02:18:58,186
of criminals? Is there a psychology similar to the

2195
02:18:58,206 --> 02:19:01,165
psychology of some of the folks we've been talking about?

2196
02:19:01,226 --> 02:19:05,106
- So, the book Green Crime is really an experiment for me in whether we can

2197
02:19:05,206 --> 02:19:08,806
apply criminological and criminal psychology ideas to the

2198
02:19:08,886 --> 02:19:12,846
area of environmental protection and crimes.

2199
02:19:12,866 --> 02:19:16,786
Because there are people who are convicted of crimes, who are

2200
02:19:16,846 --> 02:19:20,686
convicted of crimes specifically in relation to destroying the Earth

2201
02:19:20,706 --> 02:19:24,656
and our natural resources, our shared resources. I sometimes think about

2202
02:19:24,706 --> 02:19:28,665
the Earth as like a house, and if someone was coming into your house

2203
02:19:28,686 --> 02:19:32,606
and just setting things on fire and then walking out unpunished, you'd be

2204
02:19:32,646 --> 02:19:36,504
really upset, and correctly so. Or poisoning your water, or just

2205
02:19:36,546 --> 02:19:39,946
leaving a bunch of garbage all over your house. And that's what people

2206
02:19:39,986 --> 02:19:43,424
are doing on a planetary scale. And the question is, are we

2207
02:19:43,466 --> 02:19:46,886
responding effectively? And if so, who? Who is responding

2208
02:19:46,906 --> 02:19:50,826
effectively? And then what is the adequate punishment? How should we deal

2209
02:19:50,846 --> 02:19:54,426
with the people who we catch? So in this book, the question

2210
02:19:54,466 --> 02:19:58,166
was, are the people who are, for example,

2211
02:19:58,366 --> 02:20:01,926
I use the Dieselgate Volkswagen case, which was all about

2212
02:20:02,306 --> 02:20:06,046
lying about the emissions that were being produced by diesel cars,

2213
02:20:06,086 --> 02:20:08,886
especially in the United States. And so

2214
02:20:09,486 --> 02:20:13,106
Volkswagen, for 10 years, produced these cars that had what

2215
02:20:13,146 --> 02:20:16,996
was called a defeat device, which is a specific device that

2216
02:20:17,026 --> 02:20:20,186
makes it look like the cars don't emit very much nitrous

2217
02:20:20,226 --> 02:20:23,976
oxides, but they actually were way over the legal limit for

2218
02:20:23,986 --> 02:20:27,716
pollution. Now, why we should care about nitrous oxides is because

2219
02:20:27,766 --> 02:20:31,616
there is no bottom limit of nitrous oxides that

2220
02:20:31,686 --> 02:20:35,446
is healthy for the human lung. So basically,

2221
02:20:35,515 --> 02:20:39,446
any amount is bad for you. And it's related to things like asthma. It's

2222
02:20:39,486 --> 02:20:43,246
related to things like premature death. It's related to all kinds of negative,

2223
02:20:43,286 --> 02:20:47,148
immediate health effects. And this is what was

2224
02:20:47,178 --> 02:20:51,027
being pumped out of these cars at wildly high rates, 40 times

2225
02:20:51,058 --> 02:20:54,968
the legal rates in some cases, and they just

2226
02:20:54,978 --> 02:20:58,928
lied about it. They just covered it up. They didn't... Well, some of the people,

2227
02:20:58,958 --> 02:21:02,798
there's a big debate within the Volkswagen people who've been convicted.

2228
02:21:02,818 --> 02:21:06,228
A lot of people say, "I didn't really know. I'm being scapegoated."

2229
02:21:06,258 --> 02:21:10,178
Fine, people knew. The question, how much and who, that's up for

2230
02:21:10,198 --> 02:21:14,168
debate, but certainly people knew cause they had to create the thing. They had to literally create this piece

2231
02:21:14,178 --> 02:21:17,798
of software to put into the cars. And then when they got caught, they lied

2232
02:21:17,878 --> 02:21:21,648
about it, and eventually the truth came out, but it was like 10 years

2233
02:21:21,678 --> 02:21:25,298
later. And so the question is, what leads people,

2234
02:21:25,378 --> 02:21:29,298
clever people? These aren't idiots. These are clever engineers who

2235
02:21:29,338 --> 02:21:33,218
are literally working on emissions. They know exactly what these emissions

2236
02:21:33,238 --> 02:21:37,098
do to people. They know exactly how harmful they are. What leads people

2237
02:21:37,178 --> 02:21:40,638
like that to lie about it, to create these things and to continue

2238
02:21:40,678 --> 02:21:44,548
lying when they are caught? And so that is

2239
02:21:44,578 --> 02:21:47,738
one of the cases I cover in it, and I'm looking at it

2240
02:21:48,378 --> 02:21:52,358
more as a case study for this kind of crime, which is the corporate collective crime

2241
02:21:52,398 --> 02:21:56,278
and the lying, and just

2242
02:21:56,438 --> 02:22:00,338
what leads people in these settings to lie and to cover up each other's crimes

2243
02:22:00,458 --> 02:22:04,398
and to conform to these new norms, these

2244
02:22:04,458 --> 02:22:07,038
harmful environmental norms. And so I look at it

2245
02:22:07,918 --> 02:22:11,858
in that way, and then in other chapters, I look at people going undercover and

2246
02:22:12,698 --> 02:22:16,348
uncovering poaching gangs. And there it's somewhat procedural where it's

2247
02:22:16,378 --> 02:22:19,818
more, I didn't know that there were undercover

2248
02:22:19,878 --> 02:22:23,758
agents infiltrating poaching gangs. I didn't know that Interpol

2249
02:22:23,798 --> 02:22:27,678
was involved in all of these kinds of environmental crime and how it

2250
02:22:27,698 --> 02:22:31,598
gets quite exciting in some of these cases where you really see the people who

2251
02:22:31,638 --> 02:22:33,938
are trying to hold people accountable.

2252
02:22:34,138 --> 02:22:38,458
- What are the different ways to fight environmental crime that you describe?

2253
02:22:39,418 --> 02:22:43,278
- So, what I found most interesting in researching for

2254
02:22:43,418 --> 02:22:47,338
Green Crime... So, I was speaking to people from the United Nations who

2255
02:22:47,378 --> 02:22:51,178
are doing these huge research reports on things like the international

2256
02:22:51,258 --> 02:22:57,778
trafficking in wildlife crime. I was talking to people who were infiltrating

2257
02:22:58,178 --> 02:23:01,918
at the EIA, the Environmental Investigation Agency. It's like the

2258
02:23:02,118 --> 02:23:06,098
undercover police of the Earth, and they're infiltrating these

2259
02:23:06,158 --> 02:23:09,847
organized crime groups, these gangs that are involved in poaching and other

2260
02:23:09,878 --> 02:23:13,828
activities. I was talking to this Interpol agent, and I think all of

2261
02:23:13,898 --> 02:23:21,598
these people were talking about very different ways of measuring environmental crime

2262
02:23:21,698 --> 02:23:25,678
and of responding to it. So, depending on who you talk

2263
02:23:25,738 --> 02:23:29,658
to, the answer will be very different, "How do we fight crime?" And the

2264
02:23:29,718 --> 02:23:33,328
answer is also very different potentially than in other kinds of crime that are more

2265
02:23:33,358 --> 02:23:37,347
commonly discussed, like violent crime. So, initially, when I started trying

2266
02:23:37,378 --> 02:23:42,538
to apply criminal psychology to these really big crimes that are

2267
02:23:43,378 --> 02:23:47,258
often also multi-level, where you've got bosses, you've got this, whether it's a

2268
02:23:47,298 --> 02:23:51,158
corporate boss or an illegal gang boss. You've got the middlemen. You've

2269
02:23:51,178 --> 02:23:55,038
got the people on the ground who actually have the guns who are killing people or

2270
02:23:55,098 --> 02:23:58,558
animals, or logging or polluting. And then you've got all these levels of

2271
02:23:58,598 --> 02:24:02,378
people, and that makes it very different from the kinds of crimes that we

2272
02:24:02,438 --> 02:24:06,278
often talk about in other kinds of true crime, for example, where it's

2273
02:24:06,298 --> 02:24:10,278
one person, maybe a couple of people against one other person or a couple

2274
02:24:10,298 --> 02:24:14,188
of other people. And so the scale is so tiny normally, and it's

2275
02:24:14,218 --> 02:24:17,948
mostly violent crime, which is mostly arguments. It's bad

2276
02:24:18,038 --> 02:24:21,718
decisions. It's people who are frankly often quite vulnerable themselves,

2277
02:24:21,818 --> 02:24:25,458
like substance users, people with mental health problems, people who are sleeping

2278
02:24:25,538 --> 02:24:29,098
rough. These are not healthy, normal people most of the time who are

2279
02:24:29,118 --> 02:24:32,398
perpetrating bad crimes. And yet in this

2280
02:24:32,438 --> 02:24:35,938
context, in environmental crime, this is where I couldn't apply the research directly,

2281
02:24:36,918 --> 02:24:40,678
you've got some of the smartest people in the world who are still

2282
02:24:40,698 --> 02:24:44,638
engaging in fraud, who are engaging in the cover-up of financial information,

2283
02:24:44,658 --> 02:24:48,358
who are creating shell companies in order to hide certain things for poaching, the

2284
02:24:48,378 --> 02:24:52,328
proceeds of poaching. You've got people who are out there illegally fishing, and someone's

2285
02:24:52,358 --> 02:24:56,347
insuring the vessel that has been literally registered by Interpol as a criminal

2286
02:24:56,358 --> 02:24:59,638
vessel for 10 years, and someone's going, "I'll insure

2287
02:24:59,698 --> 02:25:03,648
that." And so you've got these really complicated other

2288
02:25:03,678 --> 02:25:06,808
factors going on, but I thought that's what was so interesting is ultimately

2289
02:25:07,438 --> 02:25:13,198
stripping back each layer of each of these crimes and going, "Who is

2290
02:25:13,298 --> 02:25:16,098
that person?" Who is the person who's

2291
02:25:17,098 --> 02:25:20,798
insuring this? Who is the person who is out there engaging in illegal

2292
02:25:20,818 --> 02:25:24,778
fishing on the boat? Who is the person who's financing the boat? Who is the person

2293
02:25:24,798 --> 02:25:28,698
who's investigating them, right? And so, looking at all the different levels, and I think that's where you get

2294
02:25:28,738 --> 02:25:32,578
some clarity. And actually, at the end of the book, for me, I

2295
02:25:32,638 --> 02:25:36,138
felt so optimistic. I went into Green Crime

2296
02:25:36,578 --> 02:25:40,378
because I, like most people in the world, at least according to a recent UN

2297
02:25:40,458 --> 02:25:44,398
climate survey... Something like 85 to 90% of people in the world think about the

2298
02:25:44,418 --> 02:25:48,118
climate crisis on a regular basis. Most people think about it every single

2299
02:25:48,198 --> 02:25:52,018
day. So, this idea that there's this minority of people who care about climate

2300
02:25:52,038 --> 02:25:55,758
change, that's an illusion. That's not true. And if you

2301
02:25:55,878 --> 02:25:59,798
ask people what the emotional consequences are of those feelings,

2302
02:25:59,858 --> 02:26:03,658
it's people say things like eco-anxiety, anger, sadness, grief,

2303
02:26:03,698 --> 02:26:07,648
that we're, you know, we're worried about the future. But what you want is for people

2304
02:26:07,678 --> 02:26:11,278
to feel motivated, energized, purposeful about

2305
02:26:11,288 --> 02:26:15,058
tackling one of the biggest issues of our time. And certainly by

2306
02:26:15,098 --> 02:26:18,998
meeting all of these UN researchers, but

2307
02:26:19,078 --> 02:26:23,038
I went to so many conferences. You have no idea how many conferences I went to.

2308
02:26:23,378 --> 02:26:27,018
I went to anti-corruption conferences. I went to wildlife crime conferences. I went

2309
02:26:27,078 --> 02:26:33,238
to the specific meeting of multilateral agreements to see how people were

2310
02:26:33,318 --> 02:26:37,218
negotiating in the room and the tensions between... It was wild. It's so

2311
02:26:37,258 --> 02:26:40,318
interesting. It's such a huge space, and it gave me so much hope for the future.

2312
02:26:40,358 --> 02:26:41,698
- And actually, the way you frame it,

2313
02:26:42,658 --> 02:26:51,753
very clearly is a crime against Earth. Somehow that's more actionable. And

2314
02:26:51,833 --> 02:26:55,794
it's less controversial and divisive because climate change, as a topic, has

2315
02:26:55,874 --> 02:26:57,714
become like a political issue.

2316
02:26:57,734 --> 02:27:03,083
Where it's like, is it really happening? Is it like...

2317
02:27:03,294 --> 02:27:08,114
What's the right policies? It's nice to look at actual obvious criminals.

2318
02:27:08,174 --> 02:27:12,163
- Yeah, where no one's debating, "Did someone just burn down this rainforest?" It's like, well, we can

2319
02:27:12,194 --> 02:27:15,413
see it. I was at a European Space Agency conference

2320
02:27:15,454 --> 02:27:19,424
recently, and they're telling us all about the different satellites that are imaging,

2321
02:27:19,434 --> 02:27:23,374
sort of pointing at the Earth rather than out into space, and that are imaging through all these different

2322
02:27:23,413 --> 02:27:27,274
wavelengths exactly what's changing. And they're basically just chronicling

2323
02:27:27,333 --> 02:27:31,234
how the Earth has changed over time. And a lot of these environmental crimes can be

2324
02:27:31,274 --> 02:27:35,234
seen from space and can be measured. And so, like, as long as you trust

2325
02:27:35,274 --> 02:27:38,614
those data, the question then is, okay, so these crimes are

2326
02:27:38,654 --> 02:27:42,583
happening. How do we stop them? And as you say, I was very much

2327
02:27:42,634 --> 02:27:46,174
trying... I mean, you can't write a book on environmental issues and be

2328
02:27:46,234 --> 02:27:50,094
apolitical. I think that's impossible. But I certainly was trying to look at it

2329
02:27:50,154 --> 02:27:53,854
quite logically and go, "Here's a crime. We all agree this is bad." And they

2330
02:27:53,874 --> 02:27:56,773
have, these are people who have been convicted. This isn't just someone who didn't do their

2331
02:27:56,814 --> 02:28:00,654
recycling. Because also, I think that individual level is often

2332
02:28:00,694 --> 02:28:04,554
detrimental. But these are huge, huge

2333
02:28:04,564 --> 02:28:08,344
crimes that cost us a huge amount of money to clean up and that cost a

2334
02:28:08,394 --> 02:28:11,413
huge amount of human health and, you know, have these other knock-on

2335
02:28:11,474 --> 02:28:15,394
effects and are changing, certainly, the structure of

2336
02:28:15,413 --> 02:28:18,614
our planet in a way that we can feel already. And so,

2337
02:28:19,674 --> 02:28:23,634
that is the purpose of the book is to try and show that we actually have lots of

2338
02:28:23,674 --> 02:28:27,404
laws already. We've got lots of enforcers. We've got lots of researchers on it from

2339
02:28:27,413 --> 02:28:31,274
space and not space looking at these issues, tracking them, and trying to hunt down the

2340
02:28:31,314 --> 02:28:32,034
criminals.

2341
02:28:32,094 --> 02:28:32,934
- So what can you say about

2342
02:28:33,794 --> 02:28:37,734
how people end up doing bad stuff in a company when there's

2343
02:28:37,774 --> 02:28:43,394
a lot of them? Are they bad people? How do you get to that place

2344
02:28:44,294 --> 02:28:48,054
where you, in a large collective, are doing something really bad?

2345
02:28:48,114 --> 02:28:51,753
- So, the psychology of environmental crime I find

2346
02:28:51,974 --> 02:28:55,594
often boils down to the same kinds of things that we have already been talking about in the

2347
02:28:55,634 --> 02:28:59,194
context of, quote, unquote, "evil," where it's things like

2348
02:28:59,253 --> 02:29:03,163
conformity. So, doing what you think everyone else is doing, or know what everyone else

2349
02:29:03,194 --> 02:29:06,563
is doing. So there's an industry where you know that lots of

2350
02:29:06,574 --> 02:29:10,514
people are cheating or are fudging the facts in

2351
02:29:10,554 --> 02:29:14,214
some way. Then you both feel the need and also maybe

2352
02:29:14,253 --> 02:29:18,124
rationalize the ability to also deceive because

2353
02:29:18,154 --> 02:29:21,594
it's market forces, right? Like, ultimately, in a free market or even a controlled

2354
02:29:21,634 --> 02:29:25,354
one, you've got these people who are just lying to

2355
02:29:25,374 --> 02:29:29,344
everybody else. And they're saying, "We're getting to these X outcome by

2356
02:29:29,374 --> 02:29:32,753
following the rules that everyone else is." And they're not. They're just lying to consumers.

2357
02:29:32,774 --> 02:29:36,634
They're lying to the regulators. They're just lying. And then other people who are

2358
02:29:36,694 --> 02:29:39,913
trying to be honest and you know, play the game

2359
02:29:39,994 --> 02:29:43,723
clean, they see the success of this other company and go, "Well,

2360
02:29:43,753 --> 02:29:47,574
we want to have what they have." And then they realize they can't, with the

2361
02:29:47,614 --> 02:29:51,524
tech that exists, get there. And so what do they then realize is, "Well,

2362
02:29:51,554 --> 02:29:55,074
they must be cheating." And so then they start cheating, and so it has this trickle effect

2363
02:29:55,194 --> 02:29:58,904
of making everyone else fall in line with these,

2364
02:29:58,934 --> 02:30:02,833
well, unethical practices that are unethical on so many levels.

2365
02:30:02,854 --> 02:30:06,774
And then later, you get these huge lawsuits because if you

2366
02:30:06,814 --> 02:30:10,434
know, if you get caught, then everyone's upset. The investors are upset. The

2367
02:30:10,454 --> 02:30:14,304
consumers are upset. The environmentalists, the lawyer, everybody's upset with you because you have

2368
02:30:14,314 --> 02:30:15,814
committed this huge crime.

2369
02:30:15,894 --> 02:30:19,854
- Yeah, I mean, you explain so many forces there, but even the

2370
02:30:19,913 --> 02:30:21,563
simple force of social pressure.

2371
02:30:21,594 --> 02:30:24,413
like very slight social pressure. I was just watching this,

2372
02:30:24,494 --> 02:30:32,194
documentary based on a book, Ordinary Men, talking about the Germans in

2373
02:30:32,234 --> 02:30:36,413
Nazi Germany that were taking part in the execution squads

2374
02:30:37,814 --> 02:30:43,394
in Eastern Europe and that they were given the option not to do it,

2375
02:30:44,674 --> 02:30:48,634
and ultimately, most people decided to keep being part

2376
02:30:48,674 --> 02:30:51,774
of the execution squad even though they had no hatred in their heart

2377
02:30:52,654 --> 02:30:54,174
seemingly whatsoever.

2378
02:30:54,194 --> 02:30:57,934
It's just slight social pressure. You don't want to be the guy that kind of

2379
02:30:57,994 --> 02:31:03,854
chickens out. Just a little bit of social pressure, and you are able to very quickly

2380
02:31:03,894 --> 02:31:07,333
dehumanize a large number of people and to murder

2381
02:31:07,374 --> 02:31:11,253
them without any hate in your heart, without anything that

2382
02:31:11,304 --> 02:31:14,634
could trivially, directly be identified as, quote, unquote,

2383
02:31:14,644 --> 02:31:20,954
"evil." Just normal people doing very bad things.

2384
02:31:20,994 --> 02:31:24,833
- And you can be an emissions engineer with a kid with asthma and an old

2385
02:31:25,074 --> 02:31:29,034
grandma who's struggling with her health and still feel like, "Yeah, I know

2386
02:31:29,054 --> 02:31:32,974
that I'm creating these dirty cars, and yet I'm going to do it anyway." Because as you say,

2387
02:31:33,014 --> 02:31:36,954
there's the conformity, the social pressure, the rationalization, and those are

2388
02:31:36,994 --> 02:31:40,913
all very human experiences. And that's why also in the book

2389
02:31:41,034 --> 02:31:44,833
I always focus on... whistleblower is a big word, but like people who at

2390
02:31:44,874 --> 02:31:48,422
some point actually helped to uncover what was going

2391
02:31:48,494 --> 02:31:52,264
on. And if we're back to the topic of

2392
02:31:52,264 --> 02:31:56,154
heroes, we're back to bystander effects. We're back to all of the social psychology

2393
02:31:56,174 --> 02:32:00,014
and criminal psychology that we've been talking about this whole time, which is why I thought it was so

2394
02:32:00,054 --> 02:32:05,214
important to apply that research to this context and to say, "Okay, so now we've got

2395
02:32:06,753 --> 02:32:10,654
these people who are willing to engage in these crimes. They know it." But there's also

2396
02:32:10,694 --> 02:32:14,654
this moment of how do you get out of it, and who is going to stop them? And back

2397
02:32:14,674 --> 02:32:18,644
to the idea of heroes, and you do usually in these cases at some point have a

2398
02:32:18,714 --> 02:32:22,544
hero, either an external one or an internal one who goes, "This needs to stop."

2399
02:32:23,554 --> 02:32:25,614
- Do you have empathy for those criminals?

2400
02:32:25,654 --> 02:32:28,954
- I have empathy for everybody.

2401
02:32:29,014 --> 02:32:34,794
- Has that ever been in your life challenged, like where you had trouble empathizing?

2402
02:32:35,374 --> 02:32:38,954
- Ooh. There is one context. So there is one context that

2403
02:32:39,253 --> 02:32:43,114
I... I don't know if it's that I have trouble empathizing... I think it is I

2404
02:32:43,134 --> 02:32:49,514
have trouble empathizing, and I just think it is... I don't want to. And I don't

2405
02:32:49,554 --> 02:32:56,258
know why this is the one thing, but I remember writing Evil and I got to the

2406
02:32:56,878 --> 02:33:05,098
section on sexual slavery, and there was something about that very specific issue of

2407
02:33:05,158 --> 02:33:08,988
having women, in particular, in a confined area where you have

2408
02:33:09,018 --> 02:33:12,578
often trafficked them, and then you're forcing them to engage

2409
02:33:12,698 --> 02:33:19,518
in repeated sexual acts that the person who is running that—

2410
02:33:21,878 --> 02:33:22,738
- It's tough for you.

2411
02:33:22,798 --> 02:33:26,608
- I can't. That's like the... I know that, I'm not saying that

2412
02:33:26,618 --> 02:33:30,578
that's the worst kind of crime. I don't think it necessarily is. I just think from my mind,

2413
02:33:30,638 --> 02:33:34,598
there was just a, "You can't go there." That's... I don't know how to

2414
02:33:34,638 --> 02:33:36,167
empathize with that person.

2415
02:33:36,318 --> 02:33:40,288
- Yeah, I have... I probably have a bunch of categories of people. Stuff with kids is

2416
02:33:40,378 --> 02:33:48,078
just like- ... it's tough. It's tough. It's tough. What gives you hope about

2417
02:33:48,138 --> 02:33:53,758
this beautiful world of ours, about the future of human civilization, given

2418
02:33:54,598 --> 02:33:57,038
all the darkness that you have studied?

2419
02:33:57,938 --> 02:34:01,098
- I think the fact that there are people who study the darkness gives me hope,

2420
02:34:01,858 --> 02:34:05,438
and that there are people who want to understand why we

2421
02:34:05,458 --> 02:34:09,378
do bad things, myself included, but I mostly get to benefit from other people's

2422
02:34:09,438 --> 02:34:13,298
research that I summarize into my books. And I

2423
02:34:13,338 --> 02:34:19,028
think that, I think that the tech that we are now experiencing

2424
02:34:19,998 --> 02:34:27,198
mostly also gives me hope, in that there is this whole new frontier of capacity to

2425
02:34:27,238 --> 02:34:30,918
implement scientific findings if we want to do so, and choose to do

2426
02:34:30,958 --> 02:34:34,668
so. Like also even in memory interviewing, we were

2427
02:34:34,698 --> 02:34:38,418
talking about the potential role of AI in distorting our memories.

2428
02:34:38,528 --> 02:34:42,438
I, when I do talks, when I do corporate talks, I tell people

2429
02:34:42,478 --> 02:34:46,338
the prompt that I use to use the cognitive interview, which is the best practices in memory

2430
02:34:46,378 --> 02:34:49,818
interviewing, because you can also tell AI tools to

2431
02:34:49,878 --> 02:34:53,438
do the appropriate kind of interviewing if you're talking about memory

2432
02:34:53,518 --> 02:35:01,178
things. And I created a company called Spot in 2017, which uses... Well, we're now

2433
02:35:01,238 --> 02:35:05,098
building it out to be AI, but it's basically a tool to record important emotional memories

2434
02:35:05,598 --> 02:35:09,498
and to share them as information with others. So that, I've always been interested

2435
02:35:09,538 --> 02:35:12,138
in how tech can help us to record

2436
02:35:12,958 --> 02:35:16,338
important emotional events, like with Spot, Talk to Spot.

2437
02:35:17,698 --> 02:35:21,498
and how technology can actually make us feel more human. So there are these

2438
02:35:21,538 --> 02:35:25,518
capacities like memory that we're bad at, and tech can help us

2439
02:35:25,578 --> 02:35:29,018
to overcome some of those shortcomings, as long as we use it in a

2440
02:35:29,058 --> 02:35:33,018
science-backed way rather than just sort of freestyling. I think the worry I

2441
02:35:33,098 --> 02:35:36,767
have sometimes is that, as I've said before, we're sort of ignoring the social

2442
02:35:36,818 --> 02:35:40,767
scientists entirely sometimes when building these systems. And

2443
02:35:40,818 --> 02:35:44,698
it ends up becoming this engineering math problem, when that's not actually, in terms of the

2444
02:35:44,738 --> 02:35:48,648
consequences for humanity, what it's going to be. And so I'm always

2445
02:35:48,678 --> 02:35:52,338
keen on connecting social sciences and big issues.

2446
02:35:52,398 --> 02:35:56,028
- Can you speak more to Spot? This sounds fascinating. So what,

2447
02:35:56,058 --> 02:36:02,618
what's entailed in recording important memories?

2448
02:36:02,698 --> 02:36:06,438
- So Spot came out of my going around the

2449
02:36:06,458 --> 02:36:10,327
world and giving everyone an existential crisis. So I'd go around

2450
02:36:10,358 --> 02:36:13,778
and like with you, I'd say, "Look, our memory is really faulty, and here are all the ways it

2451
02:36:13,798 --> 02:36:19,478
can lie to us." And people would go, "Oh, no." And then I'd go, "Bye."

2452
02:36:21,198 --> 02:36:21,778
- That's funny.

2453
02:36:22,038 --> 02:36:25,458
- At some point, I was like, "Maybe I should do something about this."

2454
02:36:25,618 --> 02:36:33,058
And so I did. And so I went to a... Well, I did a TED

2455
02:36:33,138 --> 02:36:37,038
Talk, and I was invited to this tech conference called Founders Forum, which is

2456
02:36:37,098 --> 02:36:40,998
this sort of meeting of tech founders and others in London, but also in a couple

2457
02:36:41,018 --> 02:36:44,958
other places. And I was invited to this, and while there, I met

2458
02:36:45,018 --> 02:36:49,238
the founder of Evernote- ... Phil Libin.

2459
02:36:49,248 --> 02:36:53,018
And so I met Phil Libin at this event, and I was talking to him

2460
02:36:53,118 --> 02:36:56,748
about my research on memory and how I've been wanting to implement or

2461
02:36:56,798 --> 02:37:00,738
translate what I've been doing into something that could prevent false

2462
02:37:00,778 --> 02:37:04,508
memories. And specifically, I was interested in creating

2463
02:37:05,038 --> 02:37:08,918
an AI or at least machine-administered version of the cognitive

2464
02:37:08,978 --> 02:37:11,858
interview. So that's the neutral

2465
02:37:12,818 --> 02:37:16,317
approach. It's already a scripted approach, which was helpful. So it's been scripted for

2466
02:37:16,358 --> 02:37:20,198
decades, or a couple of decades. It's been scripted for decades as a

2467
02:37:20,238 --> 02:37:24,118
cognitive interview. And when we train police on how to do it in places like the UK,

2468
02:37:24,178 --> 02:37:27,838
it's literally just asking people to basically read a script

2469
02:37:28,058 --> 02:37:31,838
that we have fine-tuned over the years. And what can do

2470
02:37:31,898 --> 02:37:35,858
that really well? Well, chatbots can do that really well. And so together

2471
02:37:35,898 --> 02:37:39,238
with Phil Libin and my two co-founders, Dillon and Daniel,

2472
02:37:39,518 --> 02:37:43,498
I ended up co-founding Spot, which is talktospot.com if you

2473
02:37:43,538 --> 02:37:47,398
want to check it out. And it ended up

2474
02:37:47,458 --> 02:37:51,298
pivoting into this general reporting tool for workplaces.

2475
02:37:51,358 --> 02:37:55,278
where this was before Me Too, but it was the idea being that in lots of workplace environments,

2476
02:37:55,338 --> 02:37:59,198
in lots of workplace environments, you have important emotional events that are really important to

2477
02:37:59,238 --> 02:38:02,828
understand, but are really hard to preserve. And often you have this really

2478
02:38:03,058 --> 02:38:06,998
bad evidence that you're relying on. Someone at some point sort of goes to HR and

2479
02:38:07,618 --> 02:38:11,438
says something, and somebody else says something else, and you're sort of unsure as a company maybe who to,

2480
02:38:11,578 --> 02:38:15,438
whom to trust, what's real. And so, we were trying to streamline that. And so,

2481
02:38:15,478 --> 02:38:19,398
now Spot is a reporting tool for any kind of compliance

2482
02:38:19,438 --> 02:38:23,368
issues. And so, you can talk to Spot, it's called, and it

2483
02:38:23,858 --> 02:38:27,678
is this chatbot interface that administers the cognitive interview and then creates a report

2484
02:38:27,698 --> 02:38:31,628
that then gets sent, if you want, to your employer. So we work with, like, insurance companies, medical

2485
02:38:31,698 --> 02:38:35,678
companies. We work with the Bar. So all the lawyers in the UK use it themselves,

2486
02:38:35,698 --> 02:38:39,178
which I always think is a real stamp of approval when the Bar Council is using your tool.

2487
02:38:39,198 --> 02:38:39,508
- Nice.

2488
02:38:40,178 --> 02:38:44,118
- But again, not bars and drinks. Bars and lawyers.

2489
02:38:44,158 --> 02:38:44,608
- Yes.

2490
02:38:44,638 --> 02:38:44,828
- But...

2491
02:38:44,838 --> 02:38:45,968
- Thank you for clarifying.

2492
02:38:46,338 --> 02:38:48,728
- Just picturing all these, like...

2493
02:38:48,728 --> 02:38:53,048
...people, like, with flair throwing vodka bottles in the air. Not, not them. Um...

2494
02:38:53,198 --> 02:38:54,298
- They're great too, but yeah.

2495
02:38:54,338 --> 02:38:57,858
- They could also use it, potentially. But

2496
02:38:58,278 --> 02:39:02,238
we've got people reporting like, you know, someone left bleach in a machine. So it's like a more

2497
02:39:02,278 --> 02:39:05,098
small memory. So it's streamlining reporting processes.

2498
02:39:05,138 --> 02:39:08,438
- I mean, can you envision something like Spot being used for

2499
02:39:10,058 --> 02:39:13,938
recording generally important emotional events, positive and negative throughout your life?

2500
02:39:13,978 --> 02:39:18,298
That seems like something the LLMs of today would really benefit from.

2501
02:39:18,338 --> 02:39:20,058
- Yeah. Again, that's why...

2502
02:39:20,138 --> 02:39:23,998
- Just so you're not just strictly looking at like compliance or in the

2503
02:39:24,058 --> 02:39:26,038
context of companies?

2504
02:39:26,058 --> 02:39:29,858
- So, in the context of Spot, yes, it's just compliance and it's that. But I think in

2505
02:39:29,998 --> 02:39:33,718
sort of private life and in terms of where I think this could go,

2506
02:39:33,778 --> 02:39:37,258
I'm interested in all memories, and I think that important life events can be recorded.

2507
02:39:37,318 --> 02:39:41,228
life events can be recorded. And I think the idea of having like

2508
02:39:41,258 --> 02:39:44,898
grief bots and having things that have a representation of you or

2509
02:39:44,918 --> 02:39:48,538
your loved ones, I think that's something that I'd like seeing in the future. I would.

2510
02:39:48,638 --> 02:39:50,808
I'd like seeing in the future. I would.

2511
02:39:51,238 --> 02:39:55,098
- Have you gotten a chance to work with maybe the Gemini team

2512
02:39:55,158 --> 02:39:58,998
or OpenAI folks, or any of them? Anthropic? Because it seems like they

2513
02:39:59,058 --> 02:40:02,338
don't have enough people that think about this.

2514
02:40:02,438 --> 02:40:04,678
- Well, I'm just waiting for an email.

2515
02:40:04,738 --> 02:40:06,138
- Okay. Wow.

2516
02:40:06,158 --> 02:40:07,518
- Maybe I'll get one after this.

2517
02:40:07,578 --> 02:40:08,208
- I'm hanging...

2518
02:40:08,208 --> 02:40:09,058
- Hit me up, guys.

2519
02:40:09,138 --> 02:40:12,918
- Yeah, I'm hanging out with DeepMind folks. That would be really, that'd be really fascinating

2520
02:40:12,988 --> 02:40:16,818
to see. First of all, the proper cognitive interview,

2521
02:40:16,858 --> 02:40:20,758
that's really interesting. That's really interesting how to not lead, how to

2522
02:40:20,818 --> 02:40:25,718
not to plant false memories. I don't think any of them are thinking about that.

2523
02:40:25,798 --> 02:40:29,478
- I don't think so either. And then how to make sure that you're using that

2524
02:40:29,538 --> 02:40:33,518
to help people to store contemporaneous evidence outside of their brain. I just think

2525
02:40:33,638 --> 02:40:35,318
there's so much potential that's being wasted right now.

2526
02:40:35,398 --> 02:40:39,278
- Yeah. So the hope is that technology and

2527
02:40:39,318 --> 02:40:43,158
that there's people being willing to empathize with all different flavors of

2528
02:40:43,238 --> 02:40:48,298
the human condition, that's your source of hope for the future?

2529
02:40:48,318 --> 02:40:52,258
- And to celebrate all the people who are doing amazing research and really cracking

2530
02:40:52,268 --> 02:40:55,478
down on things like environmental crime and like spending their lives

2531
02:40:55,538 --> 02:40:58,058
to fight specific kinds of crime.

2532
02:40:58,138 --> 02:41:01,998
- Yeah, I like this Earth. I hope, I hope we fight for it.

2533
02:41:02,058 --> 02:41:05,968
It's the only one we got, and I'm pretty hesitant to say that maybe in this

2534
02:41:05,998 --> 02:41:07,818
galaxy, we might be the only ones. So

2535
02:41:10,018 --> 02:41:14,238
let's, let's protect it. Well, what's your name again? Just kidding.

2536
02:41:15,778 --> 02:41:19,758
Julia, this is a huge honor. I've been a fan of yours for a

2537
02:41:19,818 --> 02:41:23,738
long time. I'm really glad we got a chance to talk. This was really fascinating.

2538
02:41:23,778 --> 02:41:27,758
Your work is fascinating, and you're just a fascinating human being, so thank you.

2539
02:41:27,818 --> 02:41:29,338
- Thank you.

2540
02:41:29,378 --> 02:41:33,358
