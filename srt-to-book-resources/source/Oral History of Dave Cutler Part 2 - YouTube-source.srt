1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,530
so blowing off steam with the team skiing racing

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:11,530
well

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,009
one of the ways we blew off steam a little bit was one of the

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,330
the

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:15,610
in fact

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,410
the guy that was the microsoft guy that had joined us early on

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,970
decided that

8
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:20,449
um

9
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:22,130
it would be a great idea to

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,650
uh

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,369
go down to laguna sea and go to the russell racing school

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,929
so i i think about

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:29,769
um

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,210
maybe about eight of us went down to the school and we went to

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,290
uh

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,690
the beginner beginner school

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,370
which i think was four days

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,329
and and we

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:40,930
we were in

20
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:41,809
um

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,170
a mazda open wheel car

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,690
and you know it was

23
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,289
that was a good thing to blow off a little steam

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,170
and and it was really an eye opener about

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:51,770
um

26
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,090
for me about driving a a race car

27
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,449
i really wasn't very good at it or wasn't as good as i thought i should have been it

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,769
and the beginner school

29
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,610
they just teach you basically how to drive the car about the dynamics of the car

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,570
uh

31
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,130
g-forces cornering and all that sort of stuff

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,689
but then they have an advanced course where you actually at the end of the course

33
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,729
you get to do a race

34
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,090
so

35
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,130
um

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,770
a few of us decided

37
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,290
well

38
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,250
we'd like to go to that too

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,930
so i don't know

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,570
you know

41
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,930
a couple three months expire and we go down and we do that

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,570
and

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,130
uh

44
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,810
so we do the race

45
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,930
we go through the advanced school and and they do some more things

46
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:36,850
um

47
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,770
and i'm getting a little better at it

48
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,930
and we finished that

49
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,530
we do our race

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,450
and that was fun

51
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,049
so i thought

52
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:44,290
well

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,570
maybe

54
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,170
you know

55
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,210
they have the school series

56
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,490
what they call school series

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,610
you basically go down once a month and you race on saturday and then on sunday

58
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,810
and you come home

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:56,810
so

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,570
and debbie was involved in this too

61
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,409
debbie came down and did the um

62
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,409
the beginner one and she did the advanced one

63
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,250
and so she and i would go down there every month for

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,450
i think we went down from oh somewhere in march

65
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,410
just september

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,610
something like that every month

67
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,610
so it was 10 races or something like that

68
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,250
so i did that

69
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,410
and and and um

70
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,890
that was fun

71
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,290
and so then they had a

72
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:25,849
they had

73
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:26,290
every year

74
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,250
they had a what they called a pro race and the pro race

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,769
they would

76
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:31,690
um

77
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,970
they didn't have governors on the systems

78
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,209
but they sort of would

79
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:36,330
uh tune

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,489
they would open them up a little bit

81
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,810
they

82
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,209
they reprogram the ecu

83
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,090
the engine control unit

84
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,090
and um

85
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,290
give them a a little more harsh power

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,450
and you know

87
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,930
they say we're going to have a pro race now

88
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,409
and the pro race meant there was a pri

89
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,370
there was a u

90
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,370
um

91
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,530
a price package

92
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,530
um

93
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,610
and you could win some money

94
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,370
i think probably the top was 10k or something like that

95
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,290
but this would draw a lot of drivers that were pretty good

96
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,730
so i i did one of those

97
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,090
i think i finished next to last

98
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,209
only because one guy

99
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,129
my first one

100
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,890
only because the other guy was worse than i was

101
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:14,890
um

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,569
so then i got involved with a guy that was one of the instructors down there

103
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,730
and another guy that owned a race team to import an atlantic car from uh new

104
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,010
zealand

105
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,170
and i

106
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,689
that was when i started into racing really seriously

107
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,569
and so i owned that car and he raced that car one year

108
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,450
which was 1995

109
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,970
and the next year i decided that

110
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,209
well

111
00:03:45,219 --> 00:03:48,610
we really should have a a new car to race

112
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,209
so i bought a new car and so the question became what to do with the old car

113
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:55,569
so i climbed in the old car and gez

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,610
i was pretty good

115
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,090
so i de saided

116
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,370
well

117
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,610
i'll race in this series

118
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,650
so i started racing the atlantic series and i raced

119
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,170
uh

120
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,170
56 races in that series

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,810
it had some per

122
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,489
i had some pretty um horrific accidents

123
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,049
nothing that i was really hurt really badly in

124
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,048
but one at laguna sea

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,048
um

126
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,850
is sort of an infamous one because espn played this over and over and over again for i

127
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,770
5 minutes of broadcast time or something and it was in one of the turns

128
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,130
i did a a um longitudinal flip

129
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,530
so you talk

130
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,370
you think about a flip that's going end over end

131
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,770
it wasn't end over end

132
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,930
it was a barrel roll flip

133
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,449
i did a flip like this and landed on the top and it was in a corner

134
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,850
where there was really dusty and the dust flew and there was big dust clouds

135
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,810
and what

136
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,370
what turn was that it was turn 10 laguna sea

137
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,410
the fast downhill sweeper to the right to the right

138
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:53,729
yeah

139
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,770
and uh

140
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,770
um

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,610
espn picked that up and and they just played that

142
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:00,970
you know

143
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:01,729
they

144
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,289
they played it over and over because

145
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:03,650
you know

146
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,009
there's a certain amount of time

147
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,289
they

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,090
they have to the yellow goes out

149
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,530
they have to clear the track

150
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:09,930
then they have to

151
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,449
you know

152
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:12,289
get the wreckers out and upate the car

153
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:12,810
so the races

154
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,690
you know

155
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,770
stop stopped

156
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,090
but they just keep playing this over and over and over again

157
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,090
so

158
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:20,650
uh

159
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,889
that was sort of my big wreck

160
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:22,490
my best

161
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,090
um

162
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,490
my best result

163
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,569
i finished eighth one time at um

164
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,490
the milwaukee mile

165
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,490
uh

166
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,370
this particular series we raced um montery mexico

167
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,610
which was a real

168
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,490
that was a real eye opener

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:38,729
um

170
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:39,850
you know

171
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,490
the rac trcks here are pretty safe

172
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,490
um

173
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,610
the racetrack there was not real safe

174
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:47,610
uh

175
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,690
i raced in um

176
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:49,970
homestead

177
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,490
uh raced in cleveland at the airport

178
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,490
um

179
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,009
mid ohio

180
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,930
which is outside of columbus

181
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,930
montreal

182
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,210
tw rivier

183
00:05:59,479 --> 00:05:59,729
which

184
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,009
which is up by quebec city

185
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,970
um vancouver

186
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,930
british columbia

187
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,449
portland

188
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:06,449
uh

189
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:07,930
long beach road america

190
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,090
i never

191
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,650
oh yeah

192
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,169
road america that in fact road america

193
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,729
not road america

194
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:13,729
uh

195
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,090
no

196
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,250
no

197
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,650
road america

198
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,530
this is elkart

199
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,169
elkart

200
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:16,930
wisconsin

201
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:17,930
yeah

202
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,770
i had a big wreck at

203
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,009
well

204
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,530
that's my second biggest wreck

205
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,610
or maybe my first biggest wreck was at road america

206
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,210
there's a turn there

207
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,889
they call the kink

208
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,449
which is about 140 or 150 mile turn

209
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,050
and i lost control of the car and hit a had a hit a stone wall there

210
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,330
and ouch

211
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,449
i got

212
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:41,289
out of the car and the car was rocking like this

213
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,410
and i couldn't really understand why that was the case

214
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,569
and i looked down and all four wheels are gone

215
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,849
i'm just sitting there in the car

216
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:50,210
you know

217
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,490
the car is built with what they call a monoco

218
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:53,289
yeah

219
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,050
tub

220
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,289
and i'm in the tub and the engine's still on the back

221
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,169
but none of the wheels are

222
00:06:57,179 --> 00:06:58,330
they're all gone

223
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,370
so i did race at road america

224
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,090
yeah

225
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:02,250
your favorite one

226
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,729
the milwaukee mile by far

227
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,370
yeah

228
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,129
oh

229
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:06,289
i

230
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:06,849
nazareth

231
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,810
pennsylvania's there too

232
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,810
any

233
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,210
uh

234
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,289
any analogies from

235
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:11,849
uh

236
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,650
racing into software development

237
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,650
yeah

238
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,090
actually

239
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,250
i think there is

240
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,530
and um it's focus

241
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,530
um

242
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,729
i've been always been a person that really can focus on the job at hand

243
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,169
and racing is driving a race car is focus

244
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,009
i mean what happened 10 milliseconds ago

245
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,650
it's gone

246
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,050
you're going to focus on what's coming up and what's going to happen

247
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,050
so

248
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,050
um

249
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,090
i think there's there's some analogy there about being really successful

250
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,169
i mean anything is to be to focus on what's important and uh

251
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,610
what what you um have to

252
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,129
uh

253
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,129
achieve

254
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,129
uh

255
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:54,449
to get

256
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,009
uh

257
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:56,569
to the success of so

258
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,530
in race car driving is

259
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,810
it was just another example that so the super intensity of concentration

260
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,810
yeah

261
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,490
it's like when

262
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,409
when you're writing code

263
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,250
what

264
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,009
how do you achieve that

265
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,569
can you stand music being on or want to be in a quiet office

266
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,690
or you know

267
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:14,650
in general

268
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,409
noise doesn't bother me much

269
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,009
um

270
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,090
you know

271
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,050
i would prefer that somebody's not

272
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,210
there's one guy at work now that whistles and that

273
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,050
you know that's not a problem

274
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,129
but he whistles down the hall

275
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,050
and you know i'm like

276
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:30,729
i

277
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:31,650
i really don't like that

278
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,929
but generally noise doesn't bother me much

279
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,969
but but i do focus on

280
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:36,729
uh

281
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,370
you know what's going on

282
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,208
especially if

283
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,929
if i write a new piece of code

284
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,409
um

285
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,409
i

286
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,690
i

287
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:43,849
you know

288
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:48,529
i write the code and i i will spend maybe um

289
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,370
three or four iterations of of executing the code in my mind

290
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,050
all the air paths

291
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,690
all the paths that can go through

292
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,610
to see if i can prove that it's correct before i even run the code

293
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,329
and most of the time

294
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,690
when i run code it

295
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,690
it pretty much runs the first time

296
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,930
it may not be absolutely correct

297
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,690
but it will run

298
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,450
it won't crash

299
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,290
um

300
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:21,490
so that's being able to focus on what's going on and not have things bother you or whatever

301
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,890
in in the nt program you

302
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,730
it was demolishing bugs

303
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,850
and you know how

304
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,250
how would you

305
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,250
uh

306
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:41,769
change the process to create less errors and make them easier to fix

307
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:42,930
the easiest

308
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,529
probably the easiest bugs to

309
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:45,089
well

310
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,890
the question is how how to make uh bugs easier to fix

311
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,410
and

312
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,050
um

313
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,050
and fewer of them

314
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,610
pardon

315
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,769
and fewer of them and fewer of them

316
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:54,769
um

317
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,810
i think fewer of them is probably the easier of the two

318
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,130
because

319
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,250
um

320
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,089
the fewer the bugs are

321
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,250
the harder

322
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,050
the ones that are left are going to be to solve

323
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,730
and the hardest bugs to solve are ones around synchronization

324
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,490
they're not around correctness of code flow

325
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,490
they're

326
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,690
they're around the correctness of synchronization um

327
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,250
where

328
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,250
um

329
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,649
there's not the correct barriers

330
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,290
there's not the correct locks or there's race conditions between code paths or something

331
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,170
um

332
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,209
one of the things that also exacerbated the five years was multiprocessing

333
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:36,329
um

334
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:38,970
i had the the be in my bonnet

335
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,329
when i went to microsoft that we were going to produce mp systems

336
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:45,050
and nobody else was producing mp systems

337
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,490
um deck had

338
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,410
at that time they had the 782

339
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,649
which was this funny asymmetric thing and we had 1170 that actually was smp

340
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,649
but there was some unibus problem that we decided not to manufacture that

341
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,810
so um s smp problems synchronization

342
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,930
is a big problem

343
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:04,649
um

344
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,930
the problem with less bugs is i think through the engineering process itself

345
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,889
and and the the people you've got to have quality has to start from the bottom up

346
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,730
it can't start from the top down

347
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,810
you can't legislate quality

348
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,970
you have to quality

349
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,410
has to be something that's im born in everybody at the lowest level

350
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,250
and any link in the lowest level

351
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,570
that doesn't produce a quality

352
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:28,209
piece

353
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,889
prod produces bugs up the up the line because they interact with other pieces of the system

354
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,050
if you're

355
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,610
if you're building the

356
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,970
the lower levels of the system

357
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,410
then your leverage as far as causing problems up in the levels is very high

358
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,850
so i think

359
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,370
uh

360
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:53,570
reducing the number of bugs is is basically thinking more about quality and paying more attention to quality

361
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,089
i don't think that that that necessarily

362
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,209
you have this thing

363
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:57,410
well

364
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,529
we'll do 100 % test afterward

365
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,490
you know

366
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:00,690
we'll

367
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,769
we'll do everything and then we'll test to see how good it is

368
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,250
it's got to be built in to start with

369
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:11,410
so i think building systems with fewer bugs means paying attention to that all the way along

370
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:14,290
and not for me

371
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,010
i hate it when there's a bug filed against me

372
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:18,010
i don't like that

373
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,290
at all

374
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,850
and i don't want that bug to exist filed against me for any longer than i have to

375
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,410
i'll drop everything to go fix that bug

376
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,810
because i know i can fix that

377
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:28,810
um

378
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,570
so there needs to be that kind of mentality

379
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,329
i mean there's a lot of people that say

380
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:33,690
oh yeah

381
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,290
i got 50 bugs

382
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:34,930
you know

383
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,050
i'll get them fixed

384
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,050
well

385
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,970
it's like quitting smoking

386
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,130
you know

387
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,290
the best time to quit smoking is right now

388
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,290
it's

389
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,529
not

390
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,529
it's not an hour from now or a day from now

391
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:48,329
or a week from now

392
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,410
it's right now

393
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,209
so the best time to fix the bug is

394
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,570
right now

395
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,810
so that would be fewer bugs

396
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,130
um

397
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,570
the make them easier to fix

398
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:01,930
um

399
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,490
i don't know how we make them easier to fix

400
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,370
other than the

401
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,410
the uh building

402
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,290
better tools for analyzing what's going on

403
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:10,769
i guess

404
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:10,970
is

405
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,290
is

406
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:11,810
um

407
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,970
primarily the way we would make them easier to fix

408
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,570
and we we have lots of tools now we have

409
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,889
we have lots of tools that do the same thing that you know

410
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:20,690
somebody has said

411
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,490
um

412
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,490
well

413
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,130
that's a good tool

414
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,690
but i'd like the tool to do this

415
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,570
i don't own the tool

416
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,690
but i think i could build a tool that was a little better

417
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,050
that would do do this and maybe we could find something a little better

418
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,730
and so we have a lot of

419
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,970
we have a lot of tools we have

420
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,690
we have a lot of source level tools

421
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,570
um

422
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,250
one of the big problems that we had

423
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:40,930
uh

424
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,690
partway through

425
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,690
um

426
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,490
the

427
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,930
the evolution of nt was hitting a big security

428
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:49,730
um

429
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,730
uh

430
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,329
attack or wall or whatever

431
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,370
somewhere after um

432
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,410
about 2001

433
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:57,810
somewhere in there

434
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,130
i you know

435
00:13:59,160 --> 00:13:59,529
we were

436
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,410
we

437
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,250
the internet

438
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,089
we really got going on the internet

439
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,050
somewhere in the late 90s and

440
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:06,610
uh

441
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,850
the internet suddenly had problems with people with uh

442
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,529
viruses and trying to attack your system

443
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:14,850
um

444
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,410
so we developed some tools that analyze the source and try to to find places where you have um

445
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,329
buffer overflows are the biggest one

446
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,970
and the amount of buffer overflows that we had was just mindboggling that that

447
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:35,649
and it was like we have this tool and the tool says

448
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,170
look at

449
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,610
right here this

450
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,610
this could overflow

451
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,490
and so that was great

452
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,009
i mean that made it so that it lowered the bugs

453
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,610
um

454
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,730
even things like um

455
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,930
arithmetic overflow can cause a bug

456
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,690
because you're calcul

457
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,730
maybe you're calculating the size of the buffer that you want to allocate

458
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,490
because you got a bite count

459
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,130
and you do this computation and gez that overflows and now it looks like you need a small size

460
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,730
so you allocate that size and then you use this other size

461
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,730
uh

462
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,810
to to transfer data into it

463
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,889
and all of a sudden you have a problem there

464
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,170
so we have some tools that that analyze the source and

465
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:15,850
uh

466
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,170
and actually

467
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,769
um point out places where there's bugs and and we actually fix those like they're bugs

468
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,930
the problem with those tools are that they're static analysis tools and they have a lot of false positives

469
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,089
so you see a lot of things that that aren't really problems

470
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,529
and it can't see some things you know you

471
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:36,810
you

472
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,329
you may have in your code

473
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:48,050
you may have had logic that made it impossible for the thing that it's complaining about to occur

474
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,490
and it'll say

475
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:49,850
hey

476
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,490
this is bad

477
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,050
so those have to be filtered out

478
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,009
and so we have ways to filter that out too

479
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,889
if you go back a little bit to

480
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,690
you know

481
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,449
getting programmers to really produce good code is

482
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:12,050
is there a dave cutler school of how to get a programmer moving along in that direction

483
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:13,089
uh

484
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,769
do i have a a way to move people to build good code

485
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,490
um

486
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:18,329
i guess

487
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,529
the only way that i can say that i have

488
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,410
um

489
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,810
helped people build good code is

490
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,449
by example

491
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:25,569
you know

492
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,089
um

493
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,810
everything that i do

494
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,930
i try to make it get my best and everybody sees

495
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,649
the source

496
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,170
and obviously they see that i don't have a very big bug count or a zero bug count

497
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,170
um

498
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,209
they look at my code and i i hope that that that really

499
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,490
um

500
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,810
helps them become better programmers

501
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:48,690
um

502
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,130
but another aspect of this is is really with the young people starting out to really ingrain in them

503
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,610
the the importance of quality

504
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:57,930
i mean i

505
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:58,209
i

506
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,370
for me

507
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,089
there's nothing worse than software that doesn't work

508
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:03,449
i mean i

509
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,650
i just can get really upset with software that doesn't work where it's obvious that something

510
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,089
just

511
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,289
i mean something simple

512
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,130
i mean if something doesn't work on your phone or it doesn't work on your tablet

513
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,169
or it doesn't work on your pc

514
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,849
that should work it

515
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,369
it

516
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,569
it should infuriate you

517
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,609
because it just should not be that way

518
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:23,929
right

519
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,650
it should be all the stuff that doesn't work

520
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,250
should be stuff that that is little tiny things

521
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,650
maybe it's like there's a few pixels over here that are wrong

522
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,650
uh

523
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,250
or or something that that's just minor

524
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,250
uh

525
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:38,530
in fact

526
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,210
a lot of the bugs

527
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,010
uh

528
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:40,890
um

529
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,330
that are that have been and continue to be filed against nt

530
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:45,730
are

531
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,730
are these kind of things

532
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,210
they're cosmetic things and they tend to

533
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,450
they have low priority

534
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,450
so those things are not upsetting

535
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,250
but it's upsetting

536
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,409
when you have something where you ship a product and it's in the field for four months

537
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,490
and all of a sudden there's this disaster that happens where you wipe out

538
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,289
you know somebody's data

539
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,610
and then all of a sudden it's like wow

540
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,690
that's really a problem

541
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,010
so i think quality is something that starting out with young people and saying hey

542
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,570
you know

543
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,809
we really got to have quality

544
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,049
so you

545
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,090
you come to 93

546
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,929
i think it is in the final

547
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,690
93 is the release date of nt

548
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,130
the official release

549
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,570
millions of copies shipped

550
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,570
the uh

551
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,850
initial version of nt is shipped in uh

552
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:38,169
1993

553
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:39,690
and then we shipped

554
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:41,049
um

555
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,130
n35

556
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:50,210
which was alpha support about six months later and and part of that was also a a uh

557
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:50,690
kind of cleanup

558
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,730
let's improve the performance of the system release

559
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:55,929
um

560
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,169
we did not have the performance level in the system

561
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:01,650
in the first release

562
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,610
we would like to

563
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:02,809
had

564
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,490
it was a little bit bloated

565
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,690
now bloated in those days was like maybe it took 24 megabytes

566
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,690
this

567
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,010
of course

568
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,690
a two gigabytes or four gigabytes

569
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,370
um

570
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,090
so daytona was kind of this dual thing

571
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:17,809
where it was this

572
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,169
it was called daytona

573
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,289
it was actually the daytona release and our our big thing

574
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:23,929
there was the racetrack and everything

575
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,210
and um i think we actually may have

576
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,210
uh

577
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:28,730
well

578
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,809
we had some racetrack stuff because we off been all off to the race school

579
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:34,809
uh

580
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:35,130
and we

581
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,570
and we incorporated alpha support

582
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,330
and then

583
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,929
just a little bit later than that

584
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:41,210
we did the power pc

585
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,169
so that brought us to the first

586
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,370
the end of the first release

587
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,690
and then the next release was um

588
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,530
nt40

589
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,210
and nt40 is an interesting release

590
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,250
because at the end of of the release release

591
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:57,690
one

592
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,890
or we actually call it

593
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,690
we actually call it 3. 1

594
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,210
because windows was 3. 1

595
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,090
the 16-bit windows was 3. 1 and the the

596
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,090
the feeling was that nobody would buy an operating system that was a 1 nobody

597
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,809
so would start out with a number that wasn't a 1

598
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,409
and well

599
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:20,049
we pick the same number as the 16bit thing

600
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,210
so then then we had 35 and 351

601
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,010
well

602
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,490
the next one was going to be 40

603
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,010
and in the meantime another guy had been hired from banyan

604
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,730
his name was jim alon

605
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:40,409
and he had actually was starting another project called cairo and cairo was

606
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:48,650
was envisioned to be a system that would incorporate some of the things you now see with internet search

607
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,809
only it would be locally

608
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,010
an indexing

609
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:52,570
file

610
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,090
a new file system that had indexing indexing all your mail and everything

611
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,970
and it was internally in

612
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,970
microsoft was called information at your fingertips

613
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,490
and he started this project

614
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,530
and it was kind of running with in parallel with the tail end of release one

615
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,529
so when we started release 2

616
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:11,529
um

617
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,289
well actually was would be it was n4o

618
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,289
um

619
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,650
the cairo project

620
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,730
alon actually came became my boss and the cairo project

621
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:22,730
uh

622
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,890
became part of the n development

623
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,289
and that was supposedly where we were going to be going

624
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,770
and i was really worried about this

625
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,370
so

626
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:34,970
um

627
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,570
i proposed another project called and we called it tucka

628
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,169
and the reason we picked tuck willa was

629
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,929
because we know where tua is and we know how to get there

630
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:48,690
it's just down the street

631
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,049
so i convinced jim that we should we had the the capability to do both of these at once

632
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,409
and throw one away

633
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,289
and it turned out that the one we threw away was cairo

634
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:08,409
and nt40 was probably one of the best systems that we produced

635
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,210
um

636
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,370
certainly not functionally

637
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,090
but as far as

638
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,690
uh

639
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,450
its acceptance and quality and performance

640
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:15,929
and

641
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:16,929
um

642
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,049
it contained the

643
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,570
uh

644
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,210
it was in 1996

645
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,370
so it was just after windows 95

646
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,570
we talk a little bit

647
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,730
we'll talk a little about that lineage of system

648
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:28,289
yeah

649
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:28,929
um

650
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,330
so it contains a new graphical user interface

651
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,730
which was drastically different from 3. 1

652
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,970
3. 1 was sort of

653
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,409
it was graphical

654
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,650
but you sort of put things together

655
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,770
you built your menus

656
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,250
and you had to do a whole bunch of stuff

657
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,250
um

658
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,049
and then the new ui actually had all that stuff

659
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:47,610
you know everything

660
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:48,650
when you got

661
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,529
the system was already installed with start menus and all that stuff

662
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,529
so nt40 had the new ui in it and it was an evolution of nt

663
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,250
caro

664
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,090
would have been an evolution of also

665
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,409
but it would have had a new file system

666
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,289
a new shell

667
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,929
just a whole bunch of new new mail system

668
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:04,929
everything

669
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:05,929
um

670
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:07,650
so i started to diver

671
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,570
or

672
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,570
um

673
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,730
i digress into windows 95 and widen

674
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,450
windows 95 came about

675
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,490
windows 95 is actually built on the dos code base

676
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:25,130
so it's actually the 16bit system with the capability to run 32-bit programs and it included this new ui

677
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,809
and it actually was very popular and sold a lot of systems it sold in in that time frame

678
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:32,809
it

679
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,010
it sold a lot more systems than nt sold

680
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:35,929
um

681
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,770
but nt sold in the places where you were doing enterprise stuff

682
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:42,770
uh

683
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,570
you needed some security

684
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,490
you needed to run server

685
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,730
you wanted to run file servers or print servers

686
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,210
those

687
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,010
those are any kind of servers

688
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,490
we had

689
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,010
then

690
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,010
um

691
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,809
so nt was alive and well and very healthy

692
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,409
but at the same time

693
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:58,010
windows 95 made the company a lot of money

694
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,370
and then they continued on with that same code base for windows 98

695
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,690
and then was with millennium

696
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,250
um

697
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,010
which i believe was in 2000

698
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,049
so

699
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:10,409
and it died

700
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,409
it completely died

701
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,929
it was

702
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,450
um

703
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,370
uh

704
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,450
a non-extensible um

705
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,169
it was bug written

706
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,970
it was notorious for doing just hanging

707
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:21,049
you know

708
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,130
it just freeze

709
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,650
and that was

710
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:23,850
not

711
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:24,770
um

712
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,450
unexpected

713
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,130
because it was built on doss

714
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,850
it wasn't built on security

715
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:29,809
no

716
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:30,049
security

717
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,010
none

718
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:32,409
none

719
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:33,409
um

720
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,490
one of the things this

721
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,490
you didn't ask me about this

722
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,890
but i might say something about security

723
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,370
you know

724
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,890
we started out in the beginning to have really robust security

725
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:48,330
and we designed of the original security model was pretty robust

726
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,330
but by today's standards completely different

727
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,850
because in those days you were protecting things

728
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,570
um

729
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,169
you were protecting people against f file access and um

730
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,169
uh

731
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,010
system resource access

732
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,490
but it wasn't like the security today where um

733
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,610
somebody invites the

734
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,010
the breach right into the system

735
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,890
they're in the browser and they click on something

736
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,010
and here comes a program they didn't even know about

737
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,090
all of a sudden

738
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,450
it

739
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:19,690
it

740
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:20,049
it

741
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:20,649
uh

742
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:23,570
it exploits a buffer overflow and bang

743
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,250
it puts something in the operating system

744
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,809
and now you're under the control of the virus

745
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,289
right

746
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,570
so anyway

747
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,289
there was a lot of controversy about whether we should make people log on or not

748
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:34,529
because the original pc

749
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,090
you know

750
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,730
you turn it on

751
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,010
there

752
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,010
it is well building

753
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,850
we're talking about security

754
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,010
and and the fact that we maybe shortcut the system a little bit with security in the beginning

755
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,490
because

756
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:46,289
um

757
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:50,010
the pc mentality was you just turn on the system and use it

758
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,330
and we really

759
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,850
we had come from the the background of time sharing systems

760
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,970
where everybody lo logged on and everything was shared and you worried about

761
00:25:59,480 --> 00:25:59,850
you know

762
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,130
people accessing your files

763
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:01,970
and geez

764
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:02,690
if it's a pc

765
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,490
you own it

766
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,450
you can access your files

767
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,130
so we actually designed the security system and built the security system and we did have log on

768
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,130
uh

769
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,370
but there were some aspects of the the system

770
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,929
that we didn't do quite as well as we we we could have

771
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,330
uh

772
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:18,770
one was

773
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,330
um

774
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,330
uh

775
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,250
when you install an application

776
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,929
you should really install an application for the user that installed it

777
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,450
not for the system

778
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,049
but since it's a pc

779
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,730
you install it for the system

780
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,570
so that was one problem

781
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,409
because now

782
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:36,649
um

783
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:41,370
you assume now that that everybody is going to use this thing

784
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,169
and that if two people have two different versions

785
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:45,649
well that you can't have that

786
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:46,570
you can only have one version

787
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,490
and then the other thing that happened with that was

788
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,210
um

789
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,289
we would have all these people that were reshipping binaries

790
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:01,970
and so somebody would have an application like office and they'd reship a binary and somebody have

791
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,130
maybe a database application that would ship a binary

792
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,690
same binary never been tested against the other guy's product

793
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,370
right

794
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,169
so we

795
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:11,770
we had

796
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:12,770
we

797
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,090
and we're still somewhat trying to work through this about state separation

798
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,289
which is part of of of casting this as part of security

799
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,090
is separating everybody's state

800
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,010
so it's only their state

801
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,010
so

802
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,490
but nt does have security and had security built in oras

803
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,490
um

804
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,770
windows 995 did

805
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,210
not

806
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,250
so the end of the

807
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,330
the dos windows

808
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,330
uh

809
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,690
comes to

810
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,770
you know

811
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,770
it can't go any further

812
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,289
and where does nt go in terms of influencing the future

813
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,529
it's called personal operating systems

814
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,529
where does it oh you mean like

815
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:48,890
uh

816
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,450
xp

817
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,169
you know seven

818
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,970
oh so on

819
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:53,690
well

820
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,210
let me tell you

821
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:56,409
it's all nt

822
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,809
there is nothing that's not nt

823
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:01,010
when when 10 is nt

824
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,929
it's all the same stuff

825
00:28:02,939 --> 00:28:08,809
it's an evolution of the same code base going all the way back to 1988

826
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:09,809
um

827
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,970
there is some interesting

828
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,250
um diversion along the way

829
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:16,850
um

830
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,330
if you want to go

831
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,570
you want to go into that right now or or sort of a little bit later

832
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,370
because i was going to

833
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:22,850
well

834
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,210
you know

835
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,570
take the direction you want to take

836
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:24,850
okay

837
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,010
i

838
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,090
i was going to say what happens in after nt40

839
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,490
yeah

840
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:28,769
good

841
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,330
after nt40 nt has grown to 400 people

842
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,049
and i'm sort of

843
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,049
uh

844
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:36,850
at the point of of

845
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,370
um

846
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,730
maybe i don't want to manage 400 people

847
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,850
maybe i want to just work on the technical things that are important

848
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,090
um

849
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,490
so i decide at nt40 that i'm not managing the the system anymore

850
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,730
that somebody else is going to manage the system

851
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:53,730
and

852
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,210
um

853
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,649
i become an individual contributor

854
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:07,010
and being individual contributor from then on basically meant i was doing the same things i was doing on the the coding implementation side

855
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,169
as i was doing before

856
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,289
i just wasn't carrying all the other stuff with me

857
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:14,370
so the next system we produced is wind

858
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:22,890
2k windows 2000 and windows 2000 was uh probably one of the first systems that we really produced

859
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:24,929
um

860
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:25,929
we

861
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:29,929
we produced a a separate serv system server skew from a

862
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:30,850
uh

863
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,409
a personal skew

864
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:34,409
uh

865
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,690
i don't know whether we produced the server

866
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:35,970
sk

867
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,690
we probably produced the server skew for n402

868
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,769
but the 2000 was more oriented towards that about writing server applications

869
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,370
um

870
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,570
wind 2k was another

871
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,409
you know

872
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:47,929
great system

873
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,450
as far as um

874
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,929
the reliability and everything

875
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,049
um

876
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,649
and my part

877
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,010
it was just basically

878
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,010
um

879
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,289
any new features we put in the kernel performance

880
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:02,769
um

881
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,649
nothing real big

882
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,210
um

883
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,210
and then we shipped that in 2000 and in 2000

884
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:12,529
um

885
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,049
there's a guy that's in charge of the consumer group

886
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:19,730
and there's a ch guy that's in charge of the server group

887
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,769
and you know they've been working together under another guy to produce the system

888
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,330
this

889
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,570
but the guy

890
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,649
that's in charge of the consumer group decides

891
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,289
that that um consumers don't need the quality that the server group needs

892
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,250
and the server group's um laundry list of features

893
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:44,730
that they want to put in the next release is way beyond what they they need for the next consumer release

894
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,730
so we split the codebase we split in xp

895
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:56,970
and the other one was a server 2003 codebase and that turned out to be not a good decision

896
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,450
and and what happened there was

897
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:01,889
um

898
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:05,570
the server 2003 codebase

899
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,570
we fixed all the security problems we were having

900
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:09,570
uh

901
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,370
we put in the server features and it actually turned out

902
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:12,769
in the end

903
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:17,809
it almost shipped at the same time as the the xp code base and the xp code base

904
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:18,610
uh

905
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,529
shipped with some new ui stuff

906
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:20,929
it

907
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:21,210
you know

908
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,850
it had this start

909
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,370
the the new start button and some other stuff

910
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,809
it was mostly ui work

911
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:27,809
uh

912
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:34,850
but also shipped with a lot of security problems and more bugs than the server 2003

913
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,929
so and i work mainly on two

914
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,210
our server 2003 and about this time

915
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:43,809
um

916
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:45,730
i don't remember the exact day

917
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,049
but it

918
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,490
it was slightly after 2000

919
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,570
amd came to us and said um

920
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,010
we have

921
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,010
um

922
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,409
a new

923
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,570
or we have an extension to the x86 architecture that will extend it compatibly to 64 bits

924
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,490
are you interested

925
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,690
and one of the things i kind of left out here is the addition of yet another platform

926
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,090
in which was in two in 2k

927
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,330
which was the itanium

928
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,130
we added itanium support in in uh wind

929
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,330
2k and the itanium would run x86 binaries

930
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,250
32-bit binaries

931
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,570
but it wouldn't run them at speed

932
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,010
so there was a speed penalty plus the fact

933
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:38,090
that titanium was never ever as fast as the fastest x86 ever

934
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,289
so amd proposing this

935
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,370
this extension

936
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,330
you know

937
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,929
looked kind of good and so we sort of looked at it and said

938
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:47,169
well

939
00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:47,970
it looks pretty interesting

940
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,090
you know

941
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,289
why don't you go back and um

942
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,809
come back when you've got it more solid and you're

943
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:55,929
you know

944
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:56,130
you're

945
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,529
you think you really want to build it

946
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,970
so they come back back in like 6 months and say here it is

947
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,330
and and i i look at it and say boy

948
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,850
this is great

949
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,889
the x86 runs at speed

950
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,610
we can produce a a small

951
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,970
like the ame thing

952
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,450
we can produce a small wrapper envelope that just executes x86 binaries

953
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,370
and they'll run it

954
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,490
whatever the speed of the processor is

955
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,090
the 64bit stuff will run at the speed of the processor

956
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,090
except it'll have a bigger address space

957
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,889
so i said this is pretty good

958
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:29,889
um

959
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,049
you know we we need to talk about whether we're going to do this or not

960
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,090
so i don't know

961
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,010
not very much time went by and there was not much

962
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:40,649
um

963
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:43,889
there was not much happening and i just

964
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,850
i went to al and said we're doing it

965
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,649
we're just going to do this

966
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,010
i'm gonna

967
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,769
i'm going to do it

968
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,169
i got a couple guys and we'll do it

969
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,649
so i basically four of us started out to do this

970
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,450
and we had done a lot of groundwork on making our codebase um

971
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,169
data type

972
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:00,370
neutral

973
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,610
as far as pointer size because of the itanium

974
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,889
and also because we were actually at one time doing a 64-bit alpha system

975
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,409
and then compact said we're not building those anymore

976
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,770
so we quit doing that

977
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:21,730
so we started out um on the the

978
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,770
what became the the x64 version of nt in the ear

979
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,210
early 2000

980
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,609
at the same time

981
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:38,969
amd was developing the architecture and got um a pretty good say in some things that were really important

982
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:39,969
um

983
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:40,449
we

984
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,168
i think we got about six features put into the processor architecture

985
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,089
that i consider to be one of them was absolutely essential

986
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,129
and that was they put in relative addressing and it's 32-bit displacement

987
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,010
so it meant that if we were willing to

988
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,930
if we were willing to say our binaries were never any bigger than two two gigabytes

989
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,930
then that displacement would always span a binary

990
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,130
so they put in the the rally of addressing they put on

991
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,730
they put in some other things were performance oriented and i had a really good relationship with a

992
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,130
with a

993
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,369
the lead micro code guy

994
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:22,089
i mean he was having a graph was just great

995
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:23,849
um

996
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:25,250
and we

997
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,290
um

998
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,730
going back to the how important this 32-bit displacement thing was

999
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,490
maybe you wouldn't think that would be important

1000
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,930
but one is position independent code

1001
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,570
it's hard to write code for the 64-bit architecture that isn't positioned independent

1002
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,410
which means that one of the main security things that you do is something called alsr

1003
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,010
which is address space relocation

1004
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,010
uh

1005
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:49,609
randomization

1006
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,329
so you take an image and you randomize where you put it in the address space

1007
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,690
well

1008
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,849
you have to relocate it when you do that

1009
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:55,970
well

1010
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,569
if there's no relocations

1011
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:57,569
you don't

1012
00:35:57,579 --> 00:35:59,690
you don't have to do much right now

1013
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,730
there still can be relocations

1014
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,170
but but to have position independent code

1015
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,050
you need the code to be independent

1016
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:06,290
as opposed to the data

1017
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,810
you can always produce pointers to the code or the data

1018
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,329
so anyway that we decided to do that with a windows 2003

1019
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,329
uh

1020
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:17,730
codebase

1021
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,010
in the meantime the xp is shipped

1022
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:31,010
and we're producing a system on the consumer side called longhorn and it became

1023
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,410
i call it does it matter

1024
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:33,849
horn

1025
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,569
because it became so bug written

1026
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:40,890
and so hard to actually get it to run

1027
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,290
that eventually it got to the point that i convinced alan

1028
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:50,290
i said we should just junk that codebase and start over with a wind 2k

1029
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,650
i'm sorry the windows 2003 codebase is the nude codebase and we did that

1030
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:01,770
we started over that system became vista and vista was that

1031
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,530
that's the way that that got delivered with system was vista

1032
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:13,369
but we actually delivered um the x64 support as a service pack to the windows 2003 server

1033
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,170
was

1034
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,569
it was

1035
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,170
it was windows 2003 server sp1

1036
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,930
and it had some new sks and they were 64-bit sks

1037
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,490
there was a a professional um desktop skew

1038
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,569
and then there was a server skew and um

1039
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:33,569
um

1040
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,450
that turned out to be very successful

1041
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,609
i mean everything's 64 bits

1042
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,050
now

1043
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,410
almost everything

1044
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,410
the telephone's not

1045
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,170
well

1046
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,849
i can't say the telephone's not 64 bits

1047
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,930
because um

1048
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:47,569
your cell phone is

1049
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:47,810
anyway

1050
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:48,650
well

1051
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:50,849
the cell phone it turns out

1052
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,010
the cell phone turns out is actually going to 64-bit arm

1053
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,650
so um

1054
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,810
they want more than 4 gigabyt of physical address space

1055
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,810
so they're going to go to

1056
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,250
uh

1057
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,690
64-bit arm

1058
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,210
there is some places where 30

1059
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:09,609
well

1060
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:11,329
i thought the 32-bits would entirely go away

1061
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,849
but there are some things like cell phones where

1062
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:14,849
uh

1063
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:19,290
smaller pointer sizes actually do end up meaning less memory

1064
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,569
you leave less memory

1065
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,250
and on phones

1066
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,130
less memory means less power drain

1067
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,369
less power drain means happier users

1068
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:27,810
okay

1069
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,730
so in the meantime here we ship 2003

1070
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,010
but just before we ship 2003

1071
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,770
we have to go back to xp again

1072
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,650
and we have to spend a ginormous effort on xp to bring up

1073
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:41,930
all

1074
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,329
bring it up to all the security enhancements we've made to um the server system

1075
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,849
so basically we do xp

1076
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:51,250
service pack 2

1077
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,890
which is basically a release

1078
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,930
a re-release of that software

1079
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,690
so that sort of brings us to the point where where and again

1080
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,490
this is all nt

1081
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,690
this is not

1082
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:01,609
you know

1083
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,569
you read

1084
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:04,690
like you read mary joe foley

1085
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,730
i don't know if you ever

1086
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,609
if you know who she is

1087
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:06,810
she's

1088
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,290
um

1089
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,530
she's written about microsoft forever and it's like this is a new operating system

1090
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:12,930
well

1091
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,930
it's not a new operation

1092
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:15,970
it's an evolution it's like

1093
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,650
um

1094
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,410
every time linux comes out with a new release

1095
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,810
it's not a new system

1096
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,930
it's an evolution of the old system

1097
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:33,849
so the xp sp2 was really a new system because it was a re-release of almost every single binary

1098
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,690
and then we went back to

1099
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,650
we did xp

1100
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,890
we d it back to

1101
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,329
then we did the the x

1102
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,089
the x64 release

1103
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,490
and then we went back and and put the resources back on vista

1104
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,970
and so vista came out basic as a 64-bit system and 32 and i vista actually supported vista

1105
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,210
i think vista actually supported

1106
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:56,970
um

1107
00:39:59,400 --> 00:39:59,849
the itanium

1108
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,010
also meantime

1109
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,569
one of the things you left out here is the risk systems were dropping off

1110
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:10,089
and i the reason here's why i think they dropped off

1111
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:19,210
i think the ris guys were so so focused on simple architecture with simple implementation

1112
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,010
that they in intel intel was like they got this architecture

1113
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,170
it's a little complex

1114
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,930
but they got got lots of transistors

1115
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,930
they got lots of design and they got lots of verification expertise

1116
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,730
letus put these these transistors to work to make everything run faster and running faster

1117
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,089
is things like

1118
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:42,970
uh

1119
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,010
very sophisticated branch prediction

1120
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,010
uh

1121
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,650
better caching

1122
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,770
you know

1123
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,130
set associative caching and just all sorts of stuff

1124
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,770
um speculation all that that the risk guys are like

1125
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,210
well

1126
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:55,530
you know

1127
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,730
we don't really want to do that stuff

1128
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:57,170
you know

1129
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,050
we want this to be simple

1130
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,329
so the thing about risk having a performance advantage

1131
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,290
just kind of went away

1132
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,810
it went away because they didn't want to

1133
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,410
there was nobody that had the resources to put to work on the chip architecture

1134
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,690
and the chip design that intel did

1135
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,089
and they didn't have the resources to do the big designs with all the transistors they had

1136
00:41:21,099 --> 00:41:22,329
i mean the they're

1137
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:22,849
you know

1138
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,490
they're billion billion transal chips now

1139
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:25,770
right

1140
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,770
so in the risk gu going to

1141
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,450
you know they want to build

1142
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:28,930
see

1143
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,369
look at this

1144
00:41:29,379 --> 00:41:30,530
we built this machine with three

1145
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:30,970
you know

1146
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,210
300, 000 gates right like

1147
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,410
so what

1148
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,210
and this

1149
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,690
the stuff on the intel processors now and the amd processes is really complicated

1150
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,849
it really is there

1151
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,810
just a ter

1152
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:42,410
you know

1153
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:42,849
out order

1154
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,650
uh

1155
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:43,890
execution

1156
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,250
and all this stuff there

1157
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:45,609
r guys

1158
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:46,810
you know they don't want to do that

1159
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:47,810
um

1160
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,650
so i think

1161
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,530
that's why the risk systems kind of went away is

1162
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:58,450
that they couldn't offer the price performance that the intel systems could

1163
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,250
they couldn't pro

1164
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,250
they couldn't provide the compatibility through the line

1165
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:07,569
i mean we had all these um software emulators running

1166
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,650
and and one of the things that we're doing now in in itanium

1167
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,569
and and actually alpha started

1168
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,250
this too is binary recompilation

1169
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,849
where you take a binary

1170
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,290
you take an xx6 binary

1171
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,530
you run it through a binary recompilation

1172
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,609
produce another binary which runs under a special um emulation

1173
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:27,849
uh

1174
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:30,490
system that mostly executes at speed of the processor

1175
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:37,569
because it's translated everything that it can find from x86 code to to alpha code

1176
00:42:37,579 --> 00:42:38,650
or whatever the carget is

1177
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:41,609
but there's still maybe a few pieces around there

1178
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,569
and so you're actually run the real binary

1179
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:49,530
and sometimes you have to actually flip into a mode that actually emulates the instructions

1180
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,609
but most of the time

1181
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:51,089
excuse

1182
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:55,730
so binary compilations has come a long ways and we would be a lot better off

1183
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,130
but still you have

1184
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,329
it's not like you just do the

1185
00:42:59,339 --> 00:42:59,530
re

1186
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,329
the binary recompilation and then you say you

1187
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,730
well

1188
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,089
i'm sorry

1189
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:07,329
you just say i'll do the recompilation and i'll just

1190
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,010
i'll just put it in the store

1191
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:09,849
right it

1192
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:10,210
it'll work

1193
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:10,450
then

1194
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:10,650
well

1195
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:10,930
it doesn't

1196
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:11,450
you know

1197
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,690
you have to go and make sure you have to test and make sure

1198
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,890
so it's a doubling of the work

1199
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:16,650
so

1200
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:17,730
um

1201
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,730
i think the the risk architectures with um with um went away in their popularity

1202
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,329
because of all those things now arm arm has taken a hold in um phones

1203
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,089
and it's taken a hold in some of the mobile devices

1204
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:36,089
um

1205
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:43,970
but arm is not anywhere near the performance capability of the x86 stuff and either from

1206
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:44,690
uh

1207
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,369
from amd or intel

1208
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,369
and you know they're trying to get there

1209
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:50,930
they're

1210
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,290
you know they're trying to to up their their their performance

1211
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,210
but they

1212
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,609
they've been primarily aimed at power and you use

1213
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,770
you use amd or i'm not amd

1214
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:06,250
you use arm processors and applications where you don't need

1215
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,130
um

1216
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,770
a lot of power

1217
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,690
maybe you need a little ship

1218
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,250
one of the things that's happened is

1219
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:11,890
you know

1220
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:18,170
intel and amd to to a certain extent is like we got a billion transistors we we got

1221
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,369
we just got to build this chip

1222
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,809
that's this big mh

1223
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:22,730
the last one was that size

1224
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,970
the next one's got to be that size

1225
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,730
even though we have four times as many transistors

1226
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,770
we're going to build it the same size

1227
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,290
right

1228
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,130
well

1229
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,290
the arm guys actually haven't done that

1230
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,569
arm guys have kind of a

1231
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,450
they have a uh

1232
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,250
a portfolio of a lot of different size chips

1233
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,730
so if you're building a watch

1234
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,329
you can build it with a chip that's smaller

1235
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,210
right

1236
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:44,609
yeah

1237
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,170
so but intel and amd have never taken this thing about

1238
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:47,450
well

1239
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:47,770
let's take

1240
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,530
we now can build the same functionality in one quarter the size

1241
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,490
maybe that would be a good product

1242
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:55,410
well

1243
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,050
this whole semiconductor process technology

1244
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:58,490
you

1245
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,329
the the end game with a p4 is we get to maybe four gig gigahertz and we

1246
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:04,569
and

1247
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,050
and the

1248
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,369
you know

1249
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:05,970
the chip is incandescent

1250
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,569
so now we go to multicores

1251
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:11,609
so this is a big event in the operating system world

1252
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,930
that we're going to have four processors to play with

1253
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,569
how did that start coming into the

1254
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,050
well

1255
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:17,450
we started

1256
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:17,930
you know

1257
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,170
nt

1258
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,329
from day one was

1259
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,970
we built nt to be mp

1260
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,170
and we

1261
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,970
our

1262
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:23,569
our initial

1263
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,809
our risk prototype

1264
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:26,930
or our reference was mp

1265
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,410
so we were mp from day one

1266
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,490
so cores are no no different than you know

1267
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,369
there's two kinds of cores

1268
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:35,089
actually

1269
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:40,170
do you think about cores as being autonomous cores or multi-threaded cores

1270
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,569
if they're multi-threaded cores

1271
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:43,849
then they're

1272
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:46,490
they're a con set of context

1273
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:53,369
that's a thread and the core hardware that actually executes that context

1274
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:57,730
and then you switch among these contexts and intel did

1275
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:58,730
um

1276
00:45:58,839 --> 00:45:59,730
it's called smt

1277
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:00,730
uh

1278
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:01,010
well

1279
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,770
multi-threading just call it multi-threading intel did this early on

1280
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,970
but we already had mp support

1281
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,369
so the only thing that was kind of a curveball

1282
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:17,329
there was that sm smp in uh

1283
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,809
increased your parallelism

1284
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:21,650
but not necessarily your performance

1285
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,849
because you basically have the same amount of execution capabilities that you had before

1286
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:33,250
you just have multiple contexts that you can run that run against that

1287
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,770
now the place that you could gain is that there's delays

1288
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:37,609
like

1289
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:38,410
uh

1290
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,849
cash misses

1291
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,010
where you can say

1292
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,010
well

1293
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:41,650
that cash miss

1294
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,130
i

1295
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,770
i missed in the cash on this set of context

1296
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,730
i can switch to another context and it can immediately execute

1297
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,250
maybe it had a cash miss before and now that data is there so you can get

1298
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:53,730
you know

1299
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,170
maybe 15

1300
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:55,170
%

1301
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,130
you can also lose 5 % or 10

1302
00:46:59,140 --> 00:46:59,130
%

1303
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,490
so very unpredictable

1304
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,650
so that kind of threw us a cruit ball

1305
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,250
amd went the other way and they did what was what they called cmt

1306
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,329
multi-threading was called smt

1307
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,569
symmetric multi-threading and the other one was called cmt

1308
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,089
and cmt was chip multiprocessing

1309
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,569
which actually put more than one processor on a chip

1310
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:27,770
so the original amd 64-bit chips were processor chips

1311
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,690
so they had two real processors

1312
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:30,690
now

1313
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,970
since then they've

1314
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:37,130
they've all migrated to this multi-core thing where they actually have

1315
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,130
uh

1316
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,650
core logic that shares some other piece

1317
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,050
uh

1318
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,329
they may share

1319
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,010
like you may have uh a couple cores that share an l2 cache

1320
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:49,970
for instance

1321
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,410
which then shares

1322
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,569
then all the the the two pairs share on l3 cache

1323
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,650
and all of that

1324
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,650
all of that now is all in nt

1325
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:00,970
you know how many levels of cash do you have

1326
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:01,290
how many

1327
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,170
what are they

1328
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:02,609
you know

1329
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:03,609
uh

1330
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,809
how many waste set

1331
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:05,050
associative

1332
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,770
are they and all of this stuff

1333
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,650
so the thing didn't really affect nt

1334
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,410
particularly it

1335
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,530
but it affected the applications

1336
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,369
because the applications now could get more performance if they're multi-threaded so if somebody started out originally with nt

1337
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,250
and said i just have a single threaded app

1338
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,849
then these other processors

1339
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,530
well

1340
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:28,690
they

1341
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:28,849
well

1342
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:33,369
they they progress through to the point where we're at 3. 5 gigahertz

1343
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,770
and you know they're all ready for the next leap to four

1344
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:38,930
and the next leap to four doesn't happen

1345
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,690
because we can't build it at four because we would have such high

1346
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:44,690
uh

1347
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,170
current leakage

1348
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,369
that you're right

1349
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:47,690
it would

1350
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:48,530
it would glow

1351
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,410
the thing would glow

1352
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,450
so we start building cores

1353
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,690
and then it seems to be like a race of how many cores we can get on a single die

1354
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:56,690
um

1355
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,089
i don't know what the biggest one is

1356
00:48:59,099 --> 00:48:59,609
but it's big

1357
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,809
it's like i don't know maybe 80 or something like that

1358
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:03,970
so there's a lot lot of cores

1359
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,569
but but for nt itself

1360
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,089
that doesn't mean much at all

1361
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:08,970
not at all

1362
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,130
it's

1363
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,849
it's mainly the applications

1364
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:15,609
where do we go from here

1365
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,770
so we're in the the kind of chronology here

1366
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,010
we're

1367
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,730
we're at vista and

1368
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:21,369
uh

1369
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:22,490
you know

1370
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,609
we we retargeted longhorn to one code base

1371
00:49:26,619 --> 00:49:31,410
so so we're actually back to one code base and i'm still an individual contributor

1372
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,690
and and i worked on vista

1373
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,930
i did some things for vista

1374
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:36,650
um

1375
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,170
mainly x64 related

1376
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,170
because i i've been the guy that that was the spearhead for x64 and you know

1377
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,450
of course

1378
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,170
i

1379
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:46,609
i say we're

1380
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,530
there are four of us that that basically did this

1381
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:49,809
we

1382
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:51,770
we did a lot of it

1383
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:52,770
um

1384
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:54,369
we did the line share of it

1385
00:49:54,379 --> 00:49:57,450
but there was a whole another effort going on that compiler world

1386
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,849
where we had a couple guys from the compiler group that were just absolutely superb

1387
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:02,930
and

1388
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:03,930
um

1389
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,290
they did a great job with a compiler

1390
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,809
so there was a a whole another group of people

1391
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,250
i

1392
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:09,290
i mean i don't know if you

1393
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,730
how many people actually

1394
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,369
you would say you know were responsible for the x64 uh system

1395
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:17,569
but it was pretty small

1396
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:18,210
you

1397
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,250
maybe a 100 people mh

1398
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,250
anyway

1399
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:24,250
so vista we shi vista

1400
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,250
um

1401
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,170
and vista is big dilemma

1402
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:28,170
because it's like

1403
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:31,809
should we ship it or should we start over

1404
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:32,970
you know

1405
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:33,250
it's

1406
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,410
doesn't look very good

1407
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,569
it's not

1408
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,770
it doesn't look the same as windows

1409
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,170
it doesn't look the same as xp

1410
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,930
it doesn't look like the same as anything we've done before it's different

1411
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:45,490
um

1412
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,010
so we shipped it and with not very good market reception

1413
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,890
a vista was probably the poorest received version of all of the windows systems

1414
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,490
that is show

1415
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,730
there was some other bob and some other things

1416
00:50:59,200 --> 00:50:59,450
well

1417
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,490
window windows systems

1418
00:51:00,799 --> 00:51:01,049
yeah

1419
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:01,210
yeah

1420
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:01,930
window bob

1421
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:02,730
yeah

1422
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,250
bob lasted

1423
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:06,530
um

1424
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:07,730
i don't know

1425
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:09,089
three to six months

1426
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,569
that was about it

1427
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,930
so this is shipped in

1428
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:14,329
uh

1429
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:17,650
november of 2006

1430
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:18,650
and

1431
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:21,089
uh

1432
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:25,650
so i sort of stuck around on the operating system group for a while

1433
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:26,290
but then

1434
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,609
and

1435
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,130
um

1436
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,970
later on in that year

1437
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,049
and i think it was around october

1438
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:36,049
um

1439
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:42,569
cloud computing was becoming a hot topic and cloud computing

1440
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:43,569
um

1441
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:44,410
is basically

1442
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:46,089
um

1443
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:48,130
moving back the other way

1444
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,130
where you know

1445
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:49,369
we

1446
00:51:49,379 --> 00:51:49,849
we move

1447
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,490
we had server

1448
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,049
we had time sharing system

1449
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:52,650
one time

1450
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,369
then we moved to servers

1451
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,170
then we moved to peurs computers

1452
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,770
and now we're moving back to central storage

1453
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,290
again

1454
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,010
where in central computing

1455
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,970
where we have a big server farm somewhere

1456
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,450
that that you can somehow you can interface through from whatever your device is

1457
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,290
and all the heavy computing or the heavy storage will occur on that end

1458
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:20,410
and we had server um farms in several places

1459
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:23,290
but they were specifically for servers for this

1460
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,609
or servers for that or whatever

1461
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,730
so there was a project that or incubation project actually was started called azure

1462
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:34,170
and it was to produce a um

1463
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,290
a system that would

1464
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:37,290
uh

1465
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:38,329
provide

1466
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:39,650
uh

1467
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,490
a platform for for people to rent

1468
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,049
where they could rent compute power

1469
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,970
they could rent storage

1470
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,730
and so i

1471
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:53,369
and we decided it was going to be a virtualized system

1472
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:56,450
because you want to run multiple instances of operating system

1473
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,130
so it had to be virtualized

1474
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:07,210
and this was at a time when the first virtualization extensions had come out for amd and for intel

1475
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,770
and we're not quite um

1476
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:15,010
at the level that we thought we had to have um

1477
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,210
specifically

1478
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,329
the paging was a real real problem

1479
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,290
and the virtualization systems that that existed

1480
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,809
the virtualization in implantations that existed at that time were their hypervisors

1481
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,170
that mainly did shadow pages

1482
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,890
shadow page tables

1483
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,290
and we thought that the direct translation was better

1484
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,690
so we decided that we would go with direct translation

1485
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,490
which adds more translation levels

1486
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:43,849
but it's direct

1487
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,890
and you don't have this

1488
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:47,730
this duplicate copy of page tables on the side

1489
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,170
and amd was the first um company that was producing those intel came along

1490
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,210
later

1491
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,210
um

1492
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,130
and we decided that that our hypervisor would be based on that

1493
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,650
and i became responsible for the hypervisor for azure

1494
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,290
and we

1495
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,290
um

1496
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,369
brought azure up and you

1497
00:54:07,379 --> 00:54:09,290
we started a server farm in quincy

1498
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,290
um

1499
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:12,170
washington

1500
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:13,569
um

1501
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,170
i don't remember how many servers we had

1502
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,450
but it was quite a few tens of millions of dollars worth of servers

1503
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,369
which was our just our test system right

1504
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,809
and we carried on for about two years and our

1505
00:54:26,839 --> 00:54:30,369
our main differentiation at that point was

1506
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:31,369
and

1507
00:54:31,379 --> 00:54:37,410
and what we were actually asked to do was produce a system that was a platform as a service

1508
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,089
which included all the things that you have to do

1509
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,250
if you have a server

1510
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,730
you know you have

1511
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,890
you have problems with configuration control

1512
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,690
where you have to keep track of the operating system you're running

1513
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:52,770
what version

1514
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,329
it is

1515
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,089
what versions of all the apps are

1516
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:55,809
and all that

1517
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,010
and then if you have multiple of these

1518
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:00,049
you you have to update them all together

1519
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,130
so we build all the infrastructure to do all that stuff

1520
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:08,650
thinking that that was going to be the big thing that people really wanted

1521
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,329
and to a certain extent it is because you don't want to have to have

1522
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:15,329
um

1523
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:16,650
you don't want to do this manually

1524
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:17,890
you don't want to manually

1525
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:18,890
uh

1526
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,089
have

1527
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:19,329
say

1528
00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:19,770
oh geez

1529
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,250
i got 150

1530
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,170
i got 2,

1531
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,170
000

1532
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:25,930
i got 10, 000 servers and a new update came out for the operating system

1533
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:26,569
well

1534
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:28,130
i've got to update every single one of those

1535
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:28,490
right

1536
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,450
do i want to sit there and do that

1537
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:30,849
well

1538
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:31,569
no

1539
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,490
and there were some internal people in in um in microsoft

1540
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,970
that actually had developed some tools to do that

1541
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:44,849
and they were mainly the ones that were running our web services

1542
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:48,450
so we decided to produce another set of tools

1543
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:49,450
and

1544
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:49,970
um

1545
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,049
i guess

1546
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:51,890
about

1547
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,130
um

1548
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:54,250
i think

1549
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,809
about two and a half years into the project

1550
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,369
we were doing well enough that

1551
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:58,650
um

1552
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,010
steve bomber decided that

1553
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,250
well

1554
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:01,369
geez

1555
00:56:01,379 --> 00:56:03,770
we are to really make this a product now

1556
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:09,289
so we we made um azure a product

1557
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,289
and i forget exactly when the first

1558
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,490
i think 2010 was the

1559
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,690
when we introduced

1560
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:15,690
um

1561
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,690
azure was the platform as a service

1562
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,890
and at that point we

1563
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,730
we're out of the incubation

1564
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,849
and um

1565
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,569
you know we're were

1566
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:27,410
um

1567
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:28,490
worried about

1568
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:34,210
you have multiple data centers because you want triple redundant logic on all of the storage

1569
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,530
and of course

1570
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,210
um

1571
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,410
we have

1572
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,049
we have

1573
00:56:38,059 --> 00:56:38,930
we want to do this internationally

1574
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:39,890
so we have

1575
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,530
you know

1576
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,569
we're building data centers in germany or in europe

1577
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:47,130
we're building data centers in the east in far east

1578
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:47,690
and

1579
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,089
uh

1580
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:49,890
then you have problems about

1581
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:50,890
um

1582
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,010
we can't migrate any

1583
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,770
you can't replicate any data across

1584
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:54,530
uh

1585
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,809
geopolitical regions cost money to move it to canada

1586
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:58,809
well

1587
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:02,970
it's mainly because of the geop geopolitical problems of interesting

1588
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:03,530
you know

1589
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:08,450
if you're storing a replication of data from germany that belongs to the german government

1590
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,690
they really don't want it stored on servers in texas

1591
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:11,890
right

1592
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:13,329
so

1593
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:14,329
um

1594
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,089
we had

1595
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:19,809
we shipped the first version of azure and um

1596
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:20,970
there was

1597
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:21,490
um

1598
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,730
a change in the management

1599
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,650
the server group and the guy that would run the server group

1600
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:27,250
um took over azure

1601
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,849
and at that time

1602
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:29,609
um

1603
00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:37,410
a couple of us decided that we'go work on the xbox and the irony of working on the xboxes

1604
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:38,410
is

1605
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,569
i once sent steve bomber

1606
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,210
a piece of mail that said steve

1607
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,730
i got an idea

1608
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,730
why don't we take that million dollars a week that we're losing on xbox

1609
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,650
and take it out in the parking lot on friday night

1610
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:57,849
and have a bonfire and roast hot dogs and and marshmallows

1611
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:01,609
we can take the people that we're working on that

1612
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,369
and put them on things that'll really produce some good stuff

1613
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:08,010
and we'll save all that money

1614
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,170
of course it was just kind of a tongue and cheek thing

1615
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,210
so here i am

1616
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,450
like seven years l

1617
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,450
going over to the dark side

1618
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,369
seven years later

1619
00:58:16,379 --> 00:58:17,930
i'm over on the dark side

1620
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:25,930
so the xbox was was kind of a real um new thing for me

1621
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,329
because this is working on something

1622
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,930
where the security is something that's much different than the security for anything else

1623
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,530
you think of security

1624
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:39,490
um

1625
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:43,089
the way you you generally think about it is physically

1626
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:43,730
phys

1627
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:44,930
you physically have the machine

1628
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:45,530
it's yours

1629
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,369
it's secure

1630
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,329
and now you just worry about keeping all those other people out that could invade it through the web

1631
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:51,690
or whatever

1632
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,089
the xbox is entirely different than that

1633
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:56,089
we

1634
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,690
we want to guard against people that have a soldering iron and a logic analyzer

1635
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:03,650
they can't break the system

1636
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,130
if they do something to modify the system

1637
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,170
it will immediately see that it's been modified and it will not

1638
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:14,650
it

1639
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:14,770
will

1640
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,210
will

1641
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:16,970
will do what it's called bricking

1642
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,450
it will brick itself

1643
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,329
it now becomes a brick

1644
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,690
it's no longer an xbox

1645
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,130
it's a brick

1646
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:28,049
so building such a system is kind of interesting and it requires a lot of uh

1647
00:59:28,059 --> 00:59:30,890
a lot of detail and attention to security

1648
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,609
a lot of hardware

1649
00:59:34,359 --> 00:59:34,609
um

1650
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,089
not necessarily in terms of cost

1651
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:38,450
but a lot of hardware

1652
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,410
a lot of

1653
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:39,849
uh

1654
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,170
a lot of encryption

1655
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:42,849
um

1656
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:49,849
amd is in the business of building custom s soc's and they built the custom s

1657
00:59:49,859 --> 00:59:50,609
so for this

1658
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:54,490
and it has um it has eight cores

1659
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:56,490
um

1660
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,849
and they're split into um four

1661
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,490
two core groups

1662
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,490
but it also has a arm security processor

1663
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,130
so the secure boot is actually secure

1664
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,289
you can't decide that you're going to solder some parts on

1665
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,569
you can't decide

1666
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,650
you'll take some parts off and reprogram them and put them back

1667
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,049
it will discover this

1668
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,809
you know everything's

1669
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:24,569
everything is encrypted

1670
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:25,569
um

1671
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,410
it runs with a hypervisor

1672
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,609
so there's a hypervisor level of protection in the system

1673
01:00:32,359 --> 01:00:32,609
um

1674
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:33,049
it runs

1675
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:36,970
it's a three-headed operating system where actually runs three virtual machines

1676
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:41,329
one is called the host system which communicates with a hypervisor

1677
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,010
and it's part of the trusted computer base and the hypervisor

1678
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,010
actually

1679
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:47,490
you know

1680
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,289
you could think of that

1681
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:49,410
it's running on the bare hardware

1682
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,010
but under the opes of the security processor

1683
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,130
you know

1684
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:58,730
the security processor has the capability to just gate off certain pieces of hardware

1685
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:00,010
so you can't even see them

1686
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,170
so it's if the hardware is only going to be accessible by the security processor

1687
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,730
it has the ability to do that

1688
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:09,329
it has the ability to just stop the processor

1689
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,010
it has a lot of control over what's going on

1690
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:14,569
so back up a bit and say why

1691
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:15,369
okay

1692
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:17,530
so the question that we were discussing was

1693
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:18,049
uh

1694
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,329
why all this security on the xbox and make it so that it's

1695
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:22,329
uh

1696
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:22,809
so the

1697
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:23,289
uh

1698
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,450
the owner can't steal

1699
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,650
and the answer is piracy

1700
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,930
the xbox games are

1701
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,010
are called aaa rated games

1702
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,690
and aaa rated games means that

1703
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,690
um

1704
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,609
they're very responsive

1705
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,010
they're high

1706
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:37,490
uh

1707
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,410
frame rate games

1708
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:39,410
um

1709
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:39,770
the

1710
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:40,650
typically

1711
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,730
the people that produce them spend a lot of money producing them

1712
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,809
and they're not like a pc game

1713
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:50,130
where typically in a pc game

1714
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,329
there's piracy

1715
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:54,809
but they get a big surge when they

1716
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,770
when they put them out

1717
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,450
and i guess that they figure that that

1718
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:00,450
um

1719
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,010
that that offsets whatever piracy that

1720
01:02:04,119 --> 01:02:06,170
but a aaa rated game

1721
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,170
um

1722
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,450
is one that's a high expense

1723
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,730
it might be hundred bucks

1724
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,490
and we guarantee that they can't

1725
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,210
we people can't pirate those games and we actually get

1726
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:17,730
uh money for that

1727
01:02:18,279 --> 01:02:23,010
so if they can't pirate games and we can convince the people that write the games

1728
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,369
they can't comp pirate the games

1729
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,650
we make money because of that

1730
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:25,930
okay

1731
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,529
so you're talking about all the all the security functions

1732
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,890
and so you've been working on the

1733
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,809
you worked on the hypervisor

1734
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,690
i work on the hypervisor

1735
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:36,609
and

1736
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:37,490
um

1737
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:38,609
you know

1738
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:43,529
the hypervisor isolates all the memory um does all the scheduling

1739
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:46,089
one of the things on the xbox is that

1740
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:49,849
and you know generally an operating system you want to share on the xbox

1741
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,170
you don't necessarily always want to share

1742
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,170
and there's a lot of actual physical partitioning of the system

1743
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:57,890
depending on what you're doing

1744
01:02:57,920 --> 01:02:59,289
if you're running a aaa rated

1745
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,650
games would take a set of cores and dedicate those to the game in a vm

1746
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,890
and so they don't deal now with the interference

1747
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:10,410
that they get with other things going on in the operating system

1748
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,130
and there's a lot of housekeeping stuff that goes on

1749
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:14,130
uh

1750
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,450
and the other things that on xbox is you actually can be running a game

1751
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,010
and viewing live tv at the same time

1752
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:24,170
or even skyping at the same time or running the internet

1753
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:24,490
explorer

1754
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:25,089
so

1755
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,210
um

1756
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,329
and not having them interfere with each other

1757
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,049
so if if you're running a game and it's in the foreground

1758
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,130
youve got six cores dedicated to you

1759
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,730
if you're running a game and it's in the quote background

1760
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,410
in other words

1761
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:39,609
you're

1762
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,490
you're focusing more on watching tv

1763
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,450
then you have four cores

1764
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,609
and the other environment has

1765
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:46,329
uh

1766
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:46,770
four cores

1767
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:48,529
so we have eight cores total

1768
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,890
so we're constantly switching these cores around

1769
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,770
and the hypervisor doing all that at the command of the host system

1770
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:55,369
the host systems

1771
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,970
keeping track what's going on

1772
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:57,970
um

1773
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:58,450
so it's

1774
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,049
it's a much different

1775
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:00,650
you

1776
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,930
you think of this as like you think of virtualization as you're running mobile operating systems

1777
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,329
so you could think of the xbox is just virtualization

1778
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:11,609
but it's really not because all this is the operating system which we call hydra

1779
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:19,849
and it it really has these three different os's running or three different vms running all right

1780
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:21,130
and one of them

1781
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:26,490
the the system os is called is our shared resource environment

1782
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:30,369
where you actually could be running things that were like

1783
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:30,890
um

1784
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:31,650
you

1785
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:36,569
you'be running live tv or netflix or hulu or whatever there

1786
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:37,609
and it has all the ui

1787
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:39,329
so everything you do

1788
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:43,809
your game controller is interfacing with something in that particular operating system

1789
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,010
but all the device drivers and everything are in the host os

1790
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,450
so there's some communication between the two through shared buffers

1791
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,450
and the game is setting it in here in another vm all right

1792
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,690
with its own resources

1793
01:04:57,079 --> 01:04:57,609
and whatever

1794
01:04:57,799 --> 01:04:59,170
so the memory is is separate

1795
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:00,210
we don't

1796
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,210
it's not like

1797
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:01,609
uh

1798
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,130
a demand page system

1799
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:03,529
where

1800
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:06,809
like a time sharing system where you steal pages from joe to give to sally

1801
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:07,369
right

1802
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:09,210
they get what they get

1803
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:09,690
so that

1804
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,210
so that every time that game runs

1805
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:12,369
it runs the same

1806
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:14,450
the audio doesn't glitch

1807
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,210
the video doesn't glitch

1808
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:17,289
and of course

1809
01:05:17,299 --> 01:05:19,529
behind this is some some pretty good

1810
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,170
uh

1811
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,450
gpu hardware

1812
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,970
so is this is got you fully engaged in terms of the future of xbox

1813
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,770
or you have your eye on something else

1814
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:31,930
right now

1815
01:05:31,940 --> 01:05:33,369
i don't have my eye on anything else

1816
01:05:33,379 --> 01:05:33,930
i'm sort of

1817
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:34,609
uh

1818
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:38,809
just trying to to keep up with what we're planning to do

1819
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:39,890
um

1820
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,690
in the future

1821
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:42,690
um

1822
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,170
which will be

1823
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:48,250
i mean most i can say about that this time is it's evolutionary

1824
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:49,250
um

1825
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,130
there are some thoughts about

1826
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,049
you know what do we do

1827
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:52,289
do

1828
01:05:52,299 --> 01:05:54,369
we do should we really have a console

1829
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,569
or should we really try to

1830
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,210
uh

1831
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,369
beef up the the um

1832
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,690
the pc environment to be able to run these aaa rated games

1833
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,770
and what would that mean it's not going to be a secure

1834
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:07,770
um

1835
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:08,690
for instance

1836
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,329
on xbox

1837
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:11,329
um

1838
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,490
there's a bunch of u certificates that you get when you buy one

1839
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:17,609
and that say what you

1840
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:17,809
well

1841
01:06:17,819 --> 01:06:19,329
there certificates say what you can do

1842
01:06:20,839 --> 01:06:21,089
well

1843
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:22,650
if you're a c

1844
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,369
if you're a consumer

1845
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:27,609
you get an xbox that you can play games on and you can do these other things

1846
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:27,849
that

1847
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:28,730
what are they apps for

1848
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,210
you can't run kently buggers

1849
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,170
you can't do any of that stuff

1850
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:37,450
so there's no opportunity for people to run those kind of attacks

1851
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,210
but on the pc operating system that you can't

1852
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:42,210
uh

1853
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:44,049
rule that out because somebody buys a pc

1854
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,770
they say i own the pc

1855
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:46,369
it's mine

1856
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:47,289
now

1857
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:47,569
thankfully

1858
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:49,289
from the day we introduced xbox

1859
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,930
until now

1860
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:51,930
um

1861
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,289
the people that buy xboxes

1862
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:55,490
they actually

1863
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:56,690
uh

1864
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:02,329
have become accustomed to the fact that that environment doesn't really belong to them to tinker

1865
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:02,970
with

1866
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,210
they can't load device drivers

1867
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,170
they can't put code in the operating system

1868
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,170
um

1869
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,130
the typical attacks that somebody would have through the um

1870
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:14,529
the uh

1871
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,450
internet explorer or the browser are not possible

1872
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:19,849
um

1873
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:24,329
or they're severely mitigated by the way the layering in the system

1874
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,010
um

1875
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:27,730
one of the things that the hypervisor does is

1876
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:29,170
and it we do all this through

1877
01:07:30,039 --> 01:07:30,289
uh

1878
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:31,289
um

1879
01:07:31,559 --> 01:07:32,490
i won't call it cryptography

1880
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,650
but it's secure hashing is

1881
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:36,650
uh

1882
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,210
we use nested paging

1883
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:43,890
which means that the hypervisor has the real page table and the real ais bits

1884
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:48,529
and that the vm has what it thinks are the page tables

1885
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,529
and what it thinks the access bits are

1886
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:52,490
but it can't get an

1887
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:54,089
can't get an execute bit turned on

1888
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:55,970
unless the hypervisor turn it on

1889
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,289
hypervisor only turn it on

1890
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:02,250
if it's in a page that has a hash that we recognize

1891
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,770
so you can inject code in the operating system

1892
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:07,690
if you find a buffer overflow

1893
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:16,448
then the best you can do is maybe you can jump somewhere where you can

1894
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,009
you can find a gadget

1895
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:24,850
and a gadget is a bunch of btes that are executable but not necessarily on instruction boundaries

1896
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:26,488
that do something

1897
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,370
some weird thing you know

1898
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,250
since the x86 is a is a variable length instruction machine

1899
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,810
there's no nice crisp instruction boundary

1900
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,448
so you can jump into the middle instructions

1901
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:37,448
so

1902
01:08:37,459 --> 01:08:44,009
that's typically what these guys do is they find a buffer overflow they jump into the middle of one of these gadgets

1903
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:48,049
which then jumps somewhere else into code that they've loaded or something

1904
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:51,810
but you can't do that on the xbox

1905
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,290
so let's shift gears into little prog prognostications about the future

1906
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,210
you know what's the future of operating systems

1907
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:02,770
that's a good question

1908
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:03,569
uh

1909
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:04,089
well

1910
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:05,810
the question is what's what's uh

1911
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:06,130
the op

1912
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:07,488
the future of operating systems

1913
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:09,408
and

1914
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:10,408
um

1915
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,488
you know

1916
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:16,250
we vms is still alive after whatever

1917
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,089
it's uh

1918
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:20,130
35 years

1919
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,210
a little over 35 years

1920
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:22,969
it's 37

1921
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:23,969
30

1922
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:24,488
yeah

1923
01:09:24,499 --> 01:09:25,250
37 years

1924
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:28,009
um

1925
01:09:28,759 --> 01:09:29,009
vms

1926
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:32,130
i do not believe is nearly as big as windows as windows

1927
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:32,810
i

1928
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:33,049
you know

1929
01:09:33,059 --> 01:09:35,170
i hate to guess how many lines of coder in windows

1930
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,969
but i think it's well over a billion

1931
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:37,969
uh

1932
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:38,890
might be several billion

1933
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:40,290
it's huge

1934
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:41,290
um

1935
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:43,488
linux is smaller

1936
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:46,810
unix is sort of gone

1937
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:48,089
um

1938
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:54,089
i really thought that linux would go the way same way that unix went where everybody took

1939
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:54,370
unix

1940
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:58,690
got a license to it and then tried to add their value

1941
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,170
by making it incompatible with all the other versions of unix

1942
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,370
which was great for us

1943
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,250
because it just made it so that there there was fragmentation

1944
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:09,850
um

1945
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,250
linux seems to have not gone that way

1946
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,690
i mean they've pretty much seem to have held themselves to be compatible

1947
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:19,409
um

1948
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,010
but still that's a huge system too

1949
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,969
it's not as huge as as as windows

1950
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,650
because it doesn't have 28 years behind it yet

1951
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:29,850
you know it's got 15 or whatever it's got

1952
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,370
but in 10 more years it'll have that too

1953
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:33,489
um

1954
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,090
there's a lot of

1955
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:35,650
uh

1956
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:43,770
little things that you can do like there's there's people that are building little operating systems for engine control

1957
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:44,690
or something

1958
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:52,010
but to build a big operating system is in in to build some level of compatibility

1959
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:57,890
to run all these apps that exist is a very large effort

1960
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:03,090
it may be an effort that even the the us government would want to take on

1961
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:10,770
so the the thought that there's going to be a new operating system at the level of of linux

1962
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,690
or of um

1963
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,530
even unix or even

1964
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:15,330
or or

1965
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:15,770
uh

1966
01:11:16,159 --> 01:11:18,370
nt is kind of like

1967
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,210
you know it's going to be difficult

1968
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:22,850
um

1969
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,050
i don't think it's going to happen very

1970
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:25,969
if that happens

1971
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,130
it's going to be a long time from now

1972
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:28,850
um

1973
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,130
and it'll happen

1974
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,449
if it happens

1975
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:37,370
it'll happen because the complexity the code bases grow to the point where it's like

1976
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:41,130
do we want to solve the complexities of the code base or just want to throw it over

1977
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,810
throw it away

1978
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:44,210
and start over and people may say

1979
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:44,489
well

1980
01:11:44,499 --> 01:11:46,130
we just want to throw away and start over

1981
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,130
however

1982
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,650
throwing it away and starting over doesn't mean that you can just junk the compatibility because you can't

1983
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:57,250
you can't junk the compatibility is is big data

1984
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,370
kind of a fork in the road for what an operating system is

1985
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:03,250
no

1986
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,810
big data is big data

1987
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,929
the way i understand big data is just it's um

1988
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,730
employing applications to um

1989
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:24,770
visualize analyze sort through big big sets of data to find relationships that you otherwise couldn't find

1990
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,850
it's not really an operating system per se issue

1991
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,210
it's

1992
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,290
it's more of a a data analysis thing

1993
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:32,889
and it's

1994
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:34,010
you know

1995
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:34,210
it's

1996
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:34,570
it's

1997
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:35,770
um

1998
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,969
we have these huge data sets

1999
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,290
we were doing this stuff at dupont

2000
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,409
we were doing one of the things they did at dupont

2001
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:45,250
they they did their own own program called rammer and rammer stored for

2002
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,170
uh

2003
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:49,170
uh

2004
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:53,290
regression analysis and multiple regression or something

2005
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,889
which was basically

2006
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,810
you're all the time at these chemical plants

2007
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:02,010
you're trying to take the data that you collect and see what environmental variables

2008
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,489
human variables

2009
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,889
operational variables

2010
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,969
chemical purity and whatever

2011
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,690
what correlates with what

2012
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,770
so you can rise to the optimum on some curve

2013
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:13,690
some process

2014
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:14,730
some on pro

2015
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,290
some process

2016
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:15,929
right

2017
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,810
and so that's part of the engineering services department had

2018
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,690
was a a math and stat group that did just that

2019
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,050
right

2020
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,969
so we've been doing this stuff

2021
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,050
but now people are starting to look at it in terms of things like marketing

2022
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:30,010
you know

2023
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,010
where do you target ads

2024
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:31,929
um

2025
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,370
and a lot of different things

2026
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,530
i don't think it's per se an operating system thing

2027
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:37,370
i mean

2028
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,489
at some point we may have

2029
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:40,650
in fact

2030
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:45,610
we probably already do have big cloud applications that people you can buy

2031
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,690
um and run and provide your data and have thousands of processors

2032
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:51,690
yeah

2033
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:52,050
well

2034
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:56,050
one of the things that's nice about the cloud is the elas icity

2035
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,530
is you can say i only want one processor right now or one core

2036
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,570
or you could say i want 10, 000 and you could get 10, 000 processors all running in parallel

2037
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:08,210
and

2038
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,409
and maybe

2039
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:10,610
um

2040
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,010
they wouldn't be

2041
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,449
they would be running as multiple instances of of um vms

2042
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,010
or they could be running as multi-processing within a vm

2043
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:19,650
right

2044
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:20,050
so

2045
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:29,090
is there any hope for the general decomposition of programs into parallel processing

2046
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,090
well

2047
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:33,250
you know people keep banging away at that stuff and it keeps getting better

2048
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,690
um people have been doing that

2049
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:36,969
you know

2050
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:37,290
uh

2051
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,449
ken kennedy at rice

2052
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,449
i mean you

2053
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:40,370
maybe you know

2054
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:40,650
ken

2055
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:40,850
ken

2056
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:41,090
ken

2057
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,850
kennedy was the big guy for the dusty deck fortran and infamous

2058
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:48,290
and i'm sure he must be a fellow is

2059
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,050
if he know

2060
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:49,730
i don't know

2061
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:50,010
yeah

2062
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:50,610
um

2063
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,610
he was part of

2064
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,170
uh

2065
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:53,969
the tera cray startup

2066
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:54,610
m

2067
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:55,610
um

2068
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,690
he was doing dusty deck fortran in 1970

2069
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:00,690
right

2070
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:02,290
where they were taking fortran

2071
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,050
and trying to take dusty deck fortran

2072
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:10,690
and compile it so it could be vectorized and and done in parallel

2073
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,850
and you know there's just lots of stuff going on

2074
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,929
i think more of the the stuff is going on now

2075
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:16,929
um

2076
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,090
to not to not necessarily take the old stuff and make it run in parallel

2077
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,010
but to always produce the new stuff to run in parallel

2078
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,010
uh

2079
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:26,489
one of the things in windows 10

2080
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:27,690
in fact

2081
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,050
i think it was in windows 8 too is um

2082
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,010
user mode scheduling

2083
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,610
to make it so that you can have

2084
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:39,530
you know tens of thousands of threads and you schedule them yourself

2085
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:40,530
um

2086
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:41,810
so that there's a minimum overhead

2087
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,530
because you know how you're switching

2088
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,290
you don't necessarily have um 10, 000 processors

2089
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,730
you might only have 20 processors

2090
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,610
but you have

2091
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,969
you know 10, 000 things that you might schedule

2092
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:55,929
so there's s of sort of a move in a direction

2093
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:56,370
that's

2094
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:57,770
um

2095
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,210
partly partly what was driving

2096
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:06,010
that was the core um frequency thing where people realized

2097
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,010
um

2098
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:09,170
i don't know when that was about five years ago

2099
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:09,489
or so

2100
01:16:09,499 --> 01:16:11,010
we realized that when

2101
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,330
when fact intel said within 10 years we're going to have a 10 gz processor

2102
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,409
and then they said oops

2103
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,690
we're not probably ever going to have a 10 gz processor because of this problem

2104
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:20,489
unless we

2105
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,130
you know

2106
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:23,130
we find some other way to build transistors

2107
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,130
so

2108
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:26,130
um

2109
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:29,449
being able to run multiple threads

2110
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:35,929
and schedule them yourself became something that that at least our people thought was um

2111
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,489
essential to being able to

2112
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:39,370
uh

2113
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:47,409
to exploit parallelism inherently in programs from the start rather than saying

2114
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:48,290
oh

2115
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,810
we're going to take this old program and make it run in parallel

2116
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,409
what do you think of ai

2117
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,969
current state of ai ai

2118
01:16:57,719 --> 01:16:57,969
well

2119
01:16:57,979 --> 01:16:58,250
you know

2120
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:00,330
ai is doing some things now that that

2121
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:02,330
um

2122
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,969
i think you know there

2123
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,130
when ai started

2124
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:09,370
there was this huge uh

2125
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:10,370
uh

2126
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:11,130
uproar about

2127
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:11,530
oh

2128
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:11,889
well

2129
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,170
gez

2130
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:12,489
you know

2131
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:14,929
it's not going to be long because computers going to be everything

2132
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,210
and it wasn't long before we thought well

2133
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:18,610
computers ever do anything

2134
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,969
but now you know there's a lot of ai that's going on

2135
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:22,449
that's pretty

2136
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,250
uh

2137
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:23,449
groundbreaking

2138
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:24,250
like

2139
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:24,730
um

2140
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:27,489
um

2141
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:28,489
well

2142
01:17:28,499 --> 01:17:28,969
i i would

2143
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,850
i'll call this ai

2144
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,090
i don't know you call it ai

2145
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:37,929
but i think the skype translator is absolutely unbelievably something that that is just unbelievable

2146
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:41,010
this is where i don't know if you know about this or not

2147
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,489
this is where you can

2148
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,250
you can be french

2149
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,130
and i can be spanish

2150
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,810
and we can actually talk to each other and the skype will automatically translate it

2151
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,050
when i talk

2152
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,690
transl my language to your language

2153
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:53,570
that's

2154
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:54,130
that's unbelievable

2155
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:55,489
that's unbelievable

2156
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,250
right

2157
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,330
how many phd theses were written about this before it happened

2158
01:17:59,520 --> 01:17:59,770
right

2159
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,250
a lot

2160
01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:01,050
a lot

2161
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,130
and you know

2162
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,010
now we have on windows

2163
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,489
we have um

2164
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:09,449
fingerprint recognition for log on and we

2165
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:09,810
debbie's

2166
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:10,650
like she's

2167
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,690
she just got a new phone

2168
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:15,730
she dropped her phone i guess yesterday morning and broke it

2169
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:18,130
and she says she's got her new phone

2170
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:19,290
it's got windows 10 on it

2171
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:19,610
and she says

2172
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,570
look at this

2173
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,449
i can log on with my eye

2174
01:18:23,159 --> 01:18:23,850
my eye print

2175
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,010
my iris print can log on

2176
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,969
so i think ai is really taken off

2177
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:30,570
um

2178
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:31,570
i

2179
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:31,810
you know

2180
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:33,170
the other thing

2181
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:33,770
i guess ai

2182
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:34,770
i

2183
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,250
i guess you should think about

2184
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:38,290
um

2185
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,210
computer controlled cars

2186
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:40,929
right

2187
01:18:40,939 --> 01:18:41,409
is ai

2188
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:43,570
and you know

2189
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,330
i think that that's great

2190
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,090
but i see on one of these things that you gave me

2191
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:48,889
uh

2192
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:49,969
there was a question about

2193
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:50,889
you know

2194
01:18:50,899 --> 01:18:53,610
will you ever sit in the back seat of a ai car

2195
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:58,449
and i think the answer to that is not for a long time

2196
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:00,449
um

2197
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:01,449
you

2198
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:01,770
i

2199
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,210
i tell you why i believe that

2200
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,010
i believe that

2201
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,010
because i you know

2202
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,889
that kind of ai is a little different than the speech thing

2203
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,449
it's like the difference between

2204
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:11,330
uh

2205
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,489
having a machine like

2206
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,010
um

2207
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:16,730
a cat scan machine kind of machine

2208
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,570
where you have

2209
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:19,449
you have a real-time control

2210
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:20,250
that machine

2211
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,530
and if that control goes wacky

2212
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,969
it kills somebody

2213
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,650
as opposed to

2214
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,810
we're speaking back and forth and we gar garble a word

2215
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,290
that's a very different thing

2216
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:30,690
right

2217
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:36,610
so knowing how big and how complicated windows is and how complicated and big

2218
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:37,610
uh

2219
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:39,170
linux is

2220
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:40,330
um

2221
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:45,850
i think that there's a high probability that there is a large number of bugs in the software

2222
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,050
unless it's extremely simple

2223
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,090
now they may have taken linux

2224
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,889
and stripped it down or whatever they took

2225
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,770
and stripped it down to such a small thing

2226
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,770
that they can actually reasonably be able to prove that it's correct

2227
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:01,770
however

2228
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,010
you know computers are not 100

2229
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:05,010
%

2230
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,969
you know they have every once in a while

2231
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,770
there's like what happened

2232
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:11,409
it just went away

2233
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,210
you know

2234
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:12,530
like

2235
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:13,530
well

2236
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,370
you know

2237
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:18,130
tandem built systems that were triple redundant logic or whatever

2238
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,929
so i don't know

2239
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:25,770
i i haven't read anything about whether they have triple redundant um controllers in these systems

2240
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:26,770
uh

2241
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,969
that control cars but i would expect they do

2242
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:30,690
and the other thing is

2243
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:31,050
you know

2244
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,370
like what happens when you know

2245
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:37,489
one time we're in lancaster california and we've

2246
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:43,050
we're going to a racetrack and we've rented a car from herz that has a neverlost

2247
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,290
and guess what we lost

2248
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,810
the never lost and we lost it

2249
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,290
because the atmospheric conditions were such that the gps could not not work

2250
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:57,850
so what happens

2251
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,489
when you're whiting down the highway

2252
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:06,290
and those atmospheric conditions occur and the gps doesn't no longer works your your proximity

2253
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:07,290
uh

2254
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,010
things work

2255
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,210
but you don't know where you're going anymore

2256
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,690
so i think there's some questions

2257
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:21,570
that need a lot of answering before we put cars on a highway at 70 m an hour

2258
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:23,010
and say yeah

2259
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,489
here we'll get in the backseat and watch tv

2260
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:24,889
me
