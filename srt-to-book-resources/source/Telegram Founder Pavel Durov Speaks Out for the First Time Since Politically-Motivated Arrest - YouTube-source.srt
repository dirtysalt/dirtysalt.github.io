1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,879
well, i'm glad you're still here.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,319
 i'm also glad i'm still here.

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:04,720
 yes.

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,000
 i mean, those of us who know you and who have followed you,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,120
 uh, looked at our phones one morning in august, i think,

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,040
 and it was pablo dv disappears in france,

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
 arrested.

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,480
 um, and then, you know, no one heard from you for several days.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,880
 it was it was kind of

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 it was actually kind of a pivot point in the way i understand europe,

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,359
 speaking for myself.

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,840
 so, if you don't mind, i don't think you've done any interviews since then.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,720
 what like what happened that day?

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,159
 you just like the events of the day.

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,960
 let's start there.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
 august last year.

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,680
 august last year, i arrived to paris

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
 and i'm greeted in the airport by a few what were you doing here?

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
 i just

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,079
 for touristic

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,800
 po purposes

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,920
 like i was just hanging

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,559
 around for

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,719
 a couple of days and i was supposed to go to finland

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,760
 after

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,600
 and

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,199
 i wasn't supposed to stay.

28
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,960
 there was no business meeting of any kind and i was greeted by policemen.

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
 they asked me certain questions asked me to follow them.

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,280
 were you confused like why are policemen meeting me at the airport?

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,600
 definitely.

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,479
 at first i thought there may be some additional

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,920
 security checks because of the olympics of the parolympics.

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
 something's going on.

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,760
 julia, my girlfriend, she was worried.

36
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,360
 she was asking me is is it all right?

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,880
 i said it's all right.

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,600
 it's france.

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,560
 it's fine.

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,640
 of course.

41
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,000
 and and then they read me a list of charges like i know 16 charges

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,119
 all kinds of crimes.

43
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,040
 i was very confused at first because like i have nothing to do with crime.

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,640
 i've never been convicted.

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,159
 i have, you know,

46
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
 we are a company that is trying to comply with the with the best standards.

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,680
 and and so at at at that moment, i realized that

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,079
 it's not something i did, it's something other people did using the app i created,

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,399
 telegram, which is used by a billion people.

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,799
 so probably some people do you know all of them or unfortunately, not.

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,520
 okay.

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,880
 unfortunately.

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,960
 um i try my best to meet more but

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,520
 so yeah and then i was put into a car and

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,720
 with a small motorcade with police cars with sirens and

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,239
 which is funny because in pre in the previous countries that i visited

57
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,560
 i also was accompanied by motorcades because i was visiting the heads of states there.

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,200
 and here in france there was certain consistency.

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,239
 so i was greeted in the same way so to say.

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,840
 were you like texting?

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,920
 i couldn't because they took my phone and i wasn't they immediately took your phone?

62
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,080
 yeah.

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
 i wasn't allowed to contact anyone except for my assistant

64
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,319
 who i

65
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,239
 asked to find me some lawyers

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,200
 and reach out to certain friends that i have and try to understand what was going

67
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,200
 on.

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
 and then i spent four days in police custody.

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,760
 a building in south of paris that

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,920
 that is i think run by the police customs the customs police officers or department whatever

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,080
 and there i had

72
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
 to answer a lot of questions

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,200
 but you spent 4 days with no contact no phone

74
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
 yes in what kind of accommodations

75
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,440
 was a seven seven square meter room or 70 ft room.

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,959
 uh, no windows, concrete block.

77
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,080
 um, a bed this narrow.

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,239
 uh, no linen, no pillow, a mattress this thin, like yoga mat this thin.

79
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,760
 uh, maybe 1 cm, 1/2 in, and that's it.

80
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,040
 and constantly, uh, blinking light, which was a bit annoying.

81
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640
 locked door.

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
 there's yeah, the the door was very securely

83
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
 locked, i must so you're in a you're in a cell?

84
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,280
 yes, it was a solitary cell, so to say.

85
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,720
 there were no other people there.

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,560
 so they put you in solitary confinement.

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,439
 you could say that.

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:01,760
 yes.

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,280
 well, sounds like that's what it is.

90
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,519
 well, it wasn't a prison or or or jail.

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,000
 it wasn't.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,640
 well, if there's a locked door, no pillow, but legally speaking, it wasn't.

93
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,280
 yeah.

94
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,040
 legally speaking, so legally speaking,

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,600
 why were you being held against your will by the french government?

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,918
 did you ever in the first four days were did they make it clear to you?

97
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:28,280
 so i understood that they were worried about the alleged

98
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
 um

99
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
 lack of response

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,880
 from telegram towards

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,919
 the judicial requests coming from france

102
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,040
 which turned out to be not true because we've never received a single

103
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
 legally binding legal request coming from france.

104
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,759
 so i was even more confused and

105
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,000
 i i asked the the french policeman, why haven't you been

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
 following the european law and

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
 serving your legal request in the way prescribed by this law, right?

108
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,120
 it's defined by the digital services act and it's it's it's there.

109
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
 it's you can google the process.

110
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,360
 you you can read the privacy policy of telegram.

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
 it's easily accessible on the website.

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
 so why didn't you do it?

113
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
 and they didn't answer

114
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,199
 but thanks god they started to do it and and then they started to receive responses

115
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,160
 helping them to identify criminal suspects

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,080
 meaning we would disclose ip address and phone number

117
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,160
 of

118
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
 people

119
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
 who were suspects in criminal investigations

120
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,360
 when we received court orders

121
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,160
 signed by a judge right and this was something that we had in place

122
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,600
 since a year ago before that so it's it's not something that the french

123
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,199
 have forced us to do.

124
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,960
 it's something that we already had in place.

125
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,320
 we had a company in belgium processing these requests.

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,160
 other countries have successfully been using this process.

127
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,479
 but somehow the french have ignored it completely.

128
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,639
 and this is why you know i was very surprised why haven't you been doing this?

129
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:02,880
 why?

130
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,160
 but this is the process.

131
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
 and and to be clear, i mean i think this is like standard for social media

132
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
 companies.

133
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,720
 a company

134
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,600
 whether it's facebook

135
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,160
 or x

136
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,560
 or

137
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:10,960
 snapchat

138
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,319
 or any of them get a court order

139
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:12,960
 from a

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,280
 country

141
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,240
 in which

142
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,600
 they have users

143
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,880
 and the court order says

144
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
 you know we have reasonably

145
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
 this person's a criminal can we have the ip address

146
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,639
 i think they all comply

147
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,120
 with that

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,759
 correct

149
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,400
 yes

150
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
 well it's the dsa law

151
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
 if you don't comply with it

152
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,360
 you can be

153
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
 fined you can be banned

154
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,919
 well it's a question whether you want to continue

155
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,600
 providing your service in the european union but it's only

156
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
 concerns it only concerns

157
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,919
 the identification data meaning ip address and in some

158
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,800
 cases phone number of the suspect.

159
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
 it has nothing to do with for example

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
 private messages of a person or other kinds of activity

161
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,800
 which is much more protected

162
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,960
 much more private even if we wanted to we wouldn't be able to disclose this information

163
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
 but it's not required by the law.

164
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,440
 yes.

165
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,199
 but what you're describing is

166
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,880
 like the state of play across europe anyway for all the companies.

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,440
 exactly.

168
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,000
 okay.

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
 so, but

170
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,840
 because this is like a normal thing that's already take it's a process that everyone recognizes

171
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,599
 and it's been ongoing.

172
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,880
 you must be very confused

173
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
 as to why you're being held in this jail that they're not calling a jail.

174
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,639
 were you confus like were you worried?

175
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,880
 it was very hard to i stepped off an airplane

176
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,720
 and a bunch of cops showed up,

177
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,039
 took

178
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:25,440
 my phone

179
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:25,680
 away

180
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,199
 and threw me in the back of a car and

181
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:27,919
 took me to a

182
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,639
 cell

183
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:28,880
 even

184
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,440
 if they pretended

185
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
 it was not a jail but wouldn't let me out and lock the door

186
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
 for 4 days without

187
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,479
 being able to contact my family.

188
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,599
 i'd be concerned.

189
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
 were were you concerned?

190
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,520
 that was very surprising.

191
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,400
 i was shocked.

192
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,039
 i was you're very diplomatic.

193
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,000
 you know, at first i thought there was some mis mistake.

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,280
 they they got the wrong guy.

195
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,759
 like i thought like they list they read the list of charges.

196
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,800
 they have nothing to do with these crimes like organized crimes, selling drugs, all those things.

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,000
 like what do i have to do with that?

198
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,120
 then i realized it's it's serious because they're not letting me out.

199
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
 they keep

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,599
 keep

201
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,960
 me there

202
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,280
 in this in this okay, but just for perspective, so you've got a billion users.

203
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
 it's a multi-billion dollar company.

204
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,599
 you started the company.

205
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,240
 you own the company.

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,800
 it's a huge company.

207
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,360
 it's one of the biggest social media companies in the world.

208
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,879
 um and so there's a process.

209
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,280
 so if they think the telegram is doing something wrong,

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,879
 they send letters to your general counsel

211
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,199
 or

212
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
 maybe get your phone number, which i'm sure they could pretty easily

213
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,599
 get.

214
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,679
 french intelligence, i'm sure, has everybody's phone number, and just call you and tell you.

215
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,760
 i've never heard of a ceo of a multi-billion dollar company

216
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,320
 getting arrested at the airport for

217
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
 on

218
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,080
 grounds like this.

219
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,040
 well, you're very right.

220
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,000
 it never happened before.

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,920
 it's like completely it's unprecedented.

222
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,640
 outrageous.

223
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,000
 it's unprecedented, right?

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
 never.

225
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,920
 so, it's something that i think was very unnecessary

226
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,040
 because on top of what you just described, i'm also a french citizen.

227
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,760
 so, in how did you wind up because you're not from france originally?

228
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,279
 yeah, i'm not from france originally,

229
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
 but i have certain ties to france and and i was awarded

230
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
 so to say this

231
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
 citizenship for

232
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,360
 using a specific process

233
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
 which took several years, but

234
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
 i didn't cut any corners

235
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
 like i had to pass the french exam

236
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
 test like if i had to do certain things that you'd normally do

237
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
 when you're because you wanted to be a french citizen.

238
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
 i wanted i like i love the country.

239
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,760
 it's a great country.

240
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
 it's a great culture.

241
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,200
 of course, these events

242
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,399
 are alarming

243
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,560
 and that's why i think it makes sense to speak about them.

244
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,560
 um, and and

245
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,959
 the most interesting part of it is that every french citizen has

246
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,920
 his or her personal home address

247
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,279
 in the passport.

248
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,320
 so, the authorities

249
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,880
 of france

250
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
 know very well how to reach out to this person

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,360
 like it's

252
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,680
 he's

253
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,560
 there or

254
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
 she's there.

255
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,440
 and on top of that, the consulate of france

256
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,519
 is located in the same building as the tilgrim office

257
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,120
 in dubai.

258
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,720
 so the same building.

259
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
 the same building.

260
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 like you remember i've been to the building.

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,519
 it's not a huge building by the way.

262
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,320
 no, not really.

263
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,160
 and it it's just two floors below.

264
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,920
 so two floors from the french consulate.

265
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,640
 we're two floors from the french consulate.

266
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
 and i was a frequent visitor to the consulate.

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
 and whenever any

268
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,720
 french agency authority or like representative of of france of the government wanted to see me,

269
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,800
 they had no issue whatsoever

270
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,640
 arranging such meetings and these meetings took place.

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
 i was happy just to go two floors

272
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
 below the my office

273
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
 and have a conversation or invite them to to our office.

274
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,720
 so it's very very strange what happened because it could have been resolved by

275
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
 different means if you think well

276
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,079
 obviously they went way out of their way to humiliate you

277
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,240
 to issue they announced that they arrested you.

278
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
 i mean you were not obviously

279
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,839
 scanning google for news stories about yourself cuz you didn't you couldn't.

280
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,399
 they couldn't.

281
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,240
 but the rest of us were and they announced we've arrested

282
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
 paul durov and

283
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,320
 arm sales or drug sales or kitty porn or i mean who knows like horrible

284
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
 it's like what?

285
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,040
 um so they were trying to terrify you and humiliate you.

286
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,240
 obviously this is something that was also very unusual.

287
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160
 so what my lawyers told me here in france that normally

288
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,480
 the prosecutor's

289
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
 office

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,399
 is not that public.

291
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,279
 they're not issuing press statements every day and they're not commenting on their investigations

292
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,600
 which was not the case with me where they were very active.

293
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,040
 they were trying to have you read the

294
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,680
 have you gone back

295
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,959
 so you were of course you were locked

296
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,279
 up and

297
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:55,600
 you couldn't

298
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,320
 read the coverage

299
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,079
 but have you gone back and read it

300
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,399
 for the those four days when you were being held?

301
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,279
 well, i when i was in police custody, i heard from one of the policemen.

302
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:13,680
 he told me every newspaper in the world is covering this and is mentioning you.

303
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,800
 and i said, "what's going on?" he said, "well, a lot of people are supportive."

304
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,399
 but i asked him, "what do newspapers write about this case?" and he told me, "everything

305
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,079
 but truth."

306
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,880
 and i freaked out at that moment, like everything but truth.

307
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
 seriously.

308
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,680
 and when i went when went

309
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
 um

310
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,360
 this four days ended

311
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,320
 and i was can i just ask like what what was your family doing?

312
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,000
 and you've got children and parents and like what were

313
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
 to be honest this is the hardest part because i'm pretty

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,040
 stress resilient so i can take care of myself

315
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,519
 but being there locked there thinking about what's going on with my mom.

316
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,200
 you know she's she's very ill.

317
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,639
 she's very elderly.

318
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,360
 she was very worried as i learned after

319
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
 what's going on with with my kids and and

320
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,160
 this is something that gets to you and

321
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,600
 and you couldn't contact them.

322
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
 no, there's no way because you don't have access to

323
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,519
 any device

324
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,440
 or you you can't even read anything.

325
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,000
 what did they think was going on?

326
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 they were very surprised and very confused and very worried.

327
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,079
 everybody wants to feel secure at home.

328
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,040
 it's your castle.

329
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,880
 there's nothing like going to sleep with a complete sense of safety.

330
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,279
 that's why you sleep soundly.

331
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,399
 that's why we cannot speak highly enough of simply safe.

332
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,760
 most security systems take action only after someone breaks into your house.

333
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
 that's a little late.

334
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,800
 simply safe's new active guard outdoor protection feature helps stop breakins before they occur.

335
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
 and that gives you peace of mind,

336
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,399
 and it means you won't have to sleep with a baseball bat or loaded handgun

337
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,920
 on your bedside, though you might want to.

338
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,200
 anyway, here's how it works.

339
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,480
 if something suspicious happens outside your property, cameras and live monitoring agents will detect it.

340
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,079
 they'll speak to the intruder, turn on spotlights, and can call the police if necessary.

341
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,120
 it's no surprise that cnet named simplysafe the best home security system of 2025.

342
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,040
 over 4 million americans trust it because it's preemptive.

343
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,600
 monitoring plans start around $1 per day.

344
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
 there are no hidden fees.

345
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,519
 60-day money back guarantee.

346
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,920

 plan and your first month free.

353
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,959
 that's simply [music] sim.com/tucker.

354
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,800
 there's no safe like simply.

355
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,440
 so, the people trying to wreck our civilization want you to be passive.

356
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,000
 they want you weak so they can control you.

357
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,440
 weakness is their goal.

358
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,480
 no thanks.

359
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,320
 our friends at beam,

360
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,519
 a proud american

361
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,079
 company,

362
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,720
 understand that our country can only be great if its people are strong.

363
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
 and that's why they've created a new creatine

 and physically

367
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,279
 fit.

368
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,720
 people like to mock creatine.

369
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,920
 cn doesn't like creatine at all, but people buy it cuz it works.

370
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,480
 beams creatine can help you improve your strength, your brain health, your longevity.

371
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,320
 it's completely free of sugar and synthetic garbage that's in almost everything else that you eat.

372
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
 of course, you don't hear about it too much because again, a population that is strong,

373
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,480
 clear-minded, and physically capable is a threat to tyrants.

374
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,199
 that's why they want you playing video games.

375
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,160

385
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,759
 it's an amazing story.

386
00:15:59,759 --> 00:15:59,920
 we

387
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,160
 did an

388
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,320
 interview

389
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:00,480
 with

390
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,639
 you

391
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:00,800
 maybe

392
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,040
 a year

393
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,360
 and a half

394
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,519
 ago

395
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:01,680
 in

396
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:01,839
 which

397
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:02,000
 you

398
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,160
 told

399
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,320
 your

400
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,040
 story.

401
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,920
 you're russian as people can probably hear in your voice

402
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
 and sound like you're pretty happy in russia, successful in russia.

403
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,600
 you had to leave russia for political reasons.

404
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,040
 the government was trying to use your company for its own purposes.

405
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,160
 you didn't want to be used.

406
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,199
 you left your own country

407
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,399
 um and moved well moved around and but wound up in dubai and france.

408
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
 were you ever arrested by putin?

409
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,320
 no.

410
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,160
 no.

411
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,399
 okay.

412
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,880
 just to put a finer point on this, i mean i'm not, you know, defending putin.

413
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,759
 but you were arrested by the french government in the free west.

414
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,880
 did that did you ever kind of see the irony there?

415
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
 that was the most unexpected

416
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,839
 place to get arrested in for me because before in this trip i visited

417
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,199
 several countries.

418
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:56,160
 some of these countries are considered in the west to be autocratic or authoritarian.

419
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
 but i had

420
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,279
 and and and tilgrim is very very popular in these countries i visited

421
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,800
 before coming to paris.

422
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:11,119
 and i had zero issues whatsoever despite the fact that tilgrim does zero

423
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,400
 censorship in terms of political speech

424
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,439
 and tilgrim provides 100%

425
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,919
 privacy and and confidentiality

426
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,039
 to its users in all these places.

427
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,839
 so you do not extract personal information from your users unlike our company.

428
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,400
 yes.

429
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,600
 we never do that.

430
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,240
 okay.

431
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
 but other companies i mean facebook is

432
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,000
 i mean meta is very rich because they extract that personal data.

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,400
 right.

434
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,200
 that's a business model.

435
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,600
 yes.

436
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,000
 that's true.

437
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
 but i'm not attacking them.

438
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,720
 sorry i am attacking them.

439
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
 but but that's what they do.

440
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
 and you don't do that.

441
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,480
 yes.

442
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
 we don't have to do that.

443
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,000
 we

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,799
 came up with ways to monetize telegram without having to abuse people's personal data this way.

445
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:03,520
 so, telegram became profitable last year and very profitable more than half a billion

446
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,080
 dollars in profit

447
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,120
 without having to rely on methods like this

448
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
 when you have to extract personal data and then

449
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
 use it for

450
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,640
 targeting ads for example.

451
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:24,240
 we have very successful sub subscription paid subscription service on telegram.

452
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,960
 we have, you know, we monetize in in ways that are consistent with our values

453
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
 that are voluntary.

454
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,919
 i mean, your users have to sign up for the things yes.

455
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,120
 that make you money, not just stealing their data from them.

456
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,760
 exactly.

457
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,640
 and and the service is free and we just crossed 1 billion monthly user

458
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,840
 threshold or milestone.

459
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,799
 congratulations.

460
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,440
 thank you.

461
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,919
 so,

462
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,880
 it's it's growing very

463
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,600
 fast and we're

464
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,720
 very happy with what we

465
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,280
 we're very

466
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,720
 proud with what we do

467
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,960
 because if you look at any

468
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,679
 mobile

469
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,960
 messaging app

470
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,799
 right now and we're number two

471
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,880
 after you can guess which other app

472
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,280
 we're the second most popular messaging app in the world.

473
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,880
 but most of the features that you use

474
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,799
 on a modern messaging app

475
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,840
 first appeared

476
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,559
 first were created by telegram and then they were borrowed.

477
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:16,880
 we

478
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,240
 came up with a list of like

479
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,640
 100

480
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,200
 such features

481
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,080
 and those are not

482
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,480
 like

483
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:20,880
 small

484
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,280
 things.

485
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,559
 those are basic things that you know in every modern messaging app like the way

486
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,679
 you

487
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,799
 respond to messages,

488
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
 the way you share links, the way you share documents,

489
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,200
 the the text formatting,

490
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,960
 many many many things like dozens of those

491
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,400
 first appeared on telegram and then three to eight years after they've been copied by

492
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,840
 our rivals.

493
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,760
 one of which is larger than telegram and others are smaller.

494
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,200
 but still we are proud.

495
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,160
 i'm not gonna guess how green one.

496
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,640
 yes.

497
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,880
 but we are proud that we're we've been able to shape

498
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,840
 what the industry is like today and and define how billions of people communicate.

499
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,360
 but it's just i'm just going back to like this story which is

500
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
 by the way i love your

501
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,400
 slavic deadpan approach to this.

502
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,480
 um it's like it's crazy.

503
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
 i mean, if mark zuckerberg or elon got grabbed,

504
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
 you know, at the

505
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,960
 private part of de gaul airport, you'd be like, "stop like what?

506
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,799
 the world is ending."

507
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,520
 but they grabbed you and people like, "oh, he's got a russian last name.

508
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:29,840
 it's fine.

509
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,840
 i'm sure there's a good reason."

510
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
 well,

511
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,440
 i hope it had nothing to do with my

512
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
 ethnicity because that of course it did.

513
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,200
 are you joking?

514
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,880
 that would be very alarming because you got run out of russia, by the way.

515
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,679
 i just want to say that again.

516
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:46,320
 you got run out.

517
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,799
 you'd probably still be living there if you hadn't had to leave.

518
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,080
 so, it's clearly you didn't participate in whatever they're mad about in russia.

519
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,440
 you're gone.

520
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:53,840
 yeah.

521
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,400
 but it still can make you an easier target.

522
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,600
 i'm aware of that because people don't know my story, right?

523
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,360
 people not everybody watched our last interview and not everybody had where was the out?

524
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,960
 so, i was well, i know you and

525
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,159
 obviously i like you so

526
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,840
 and i like what you're doing.

527
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,480
 i like your commitment to privacy and to the user and i think the users

528
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:14,960
 privacy

529
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
 should play a role in your

530
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,280
 in your thinking about a business and that's what my view and you agree

531
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,760
 most companies

532
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,400
 don't agree

533
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,919
 so i'm on your side

534
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,240
 but where were all the civil libertarians

535
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,640
 jumping to your defense like how can you just grab someone at the airport

536
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,640
 because

537
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,799
 well cuz who knows why can you just do that

538
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,240
 put him in jail for 4 days

539
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,760
 take his

540
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,760
 phone

541
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,960
 like where were your defenders?

542
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,559
 well, to be fair, some people did

543
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,039
 some speak up and and and and

544
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,400
 defended me and i actually there were

545
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,480
 more than 10 million or more than i think a very big number of people

546
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,280
 who signed a petition to free me.

547
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,600
 yes.

548
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,320
 so, it was was a a very very large movement.

549
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,640
 i was i'm thinking more like the united nations,

550
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
 you know, human rights watchd dogs like where are they?

551
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,840
 if this happened in north korea, which it, you know, i don't know, it hasn't.

552
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,880
 so, but if it happened there, we'd be like, "oh my gosh, it's stalinism,

553
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,200
 but it happens in france." and you're like, "i'm sure there's a good reason."

554
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,960
 that's you know that's what makes this situation so complicated because

555
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,480
 we have to look at the instances

556
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,480
 such as this one regardless of

557
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,280
 which jurisdiction

558
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:41,960
 i was born in which jurisdiction is conducting this investigation it should be completely

559
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,760
 unbiased right so it's it's it's very concerning.

560
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,720
 and did they ask you questions about russia during your four days of entertainment?

561
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,360
 i think so, but it wasn't the focus of their questioning.

562
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,200
 the the the the most questions were about the

563
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,280
 um way telegram operates as if it's some kind of mystery.

564
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,799
 you know, we we're a big company.

565
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,640
 we are audited by a big four auditing firm.

566
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
 we work with the with the biggest financial institutions.

567
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,919
 so we're we're a big company and we spend millions of dollars

568
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,720
 every quarter on legal compliance.

569
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
 so we pay to law firms

570
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,320
 to receive the best advice

571
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,640
 in in order to make sure we don't violate

572
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,200
 laws

573
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,760
 anywhere

574
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
 and we are we operate in almost 200 countries.

575
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,760
 so it was very very surprising for me to

576
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,039
 get detained in paris and learn that telegram did something wrong or didn't process

577
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,039
 some

578
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,039
 requests.

579
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,760
 and then when i learned more about it,

580
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,120
 i realized that we did actually nothing wrong because

581
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,400
 the law is very clear

582
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,679
 in in describing the process that should be followed

583
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,080
 in order for this request to be processed and it wasn't followed.

584
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,960
 and that's something that french prosecutors could have found out in about six minutes.

585
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,400
 obviously, that's the irony of it.

586
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,840
 it was like you could google telegram police contact, telegram

587
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
 eu

588
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,000
 corporation, whatever, and it would be instantly visible online for anybody who has access to google.

589
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,799
 for some reason, it wasn't used by, right?

590
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,799
 and you have to think that there's like a reason.

591
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,840
 before i ask about that, how was the food in french prison, by the way?

592
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,679
 um there was i think they made some exception in relation to food for me.

593
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,320
 so it was fine.

594
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,520
 i was fine.

595
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,960
 it was pretty good.

596
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,480
 i you know i don't eat meat.

597
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
 i don't eat fast food.

598
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
 so i was good with

599
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,840
 enough fish and i could do my 200

600
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,240
 push-ups in the morning like 200

601
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,960
 squats

602
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,919
 and then i repeated it because i didn't have access to a gym.

603
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,480
 so i i kept my routine there.

604
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,159
 did you join a gang?

605
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,840
 no, i was alone there.

606
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,960
 you were alone?

607
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
 anybody push in your cell?

608
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 um, it's just the whole thing's incredible.

609
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
 so, where does it stand now?

610
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,200
 you know, we're in i should say we're in france right now.

611
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,159
 you're still in france.

612
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,200
 i'm still in france.

613
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,520
 um, many many months later, eight almost eight months.

614
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,200
 eight months later, you're still in france.

615
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
 um, why are you still here?

616
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,720
 so there is this

617
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,640
 limitation on my travel traveling ability so to say which is called judicial control.

618
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,919
 judicial control is when you can't leave the country

619
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:38,720
 freely

620
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,679
 because there is still investigation going on and you one of the suspects or the suspect.

621
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,919
 i was

622
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:45,919
 still

623
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,760
 being allowed to go to dubai and i

624
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,320
 returned last week from dubai

625
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,000
 and i will be going to dubai

626
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,679
 later this week but it's it's a very very restricted

627
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
 controlled

628
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
 process still

629
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,720
 and what's the idea there since you own a multi-billion

630
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,080
 dollar company with a billion

631
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,480
 users

632
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,279
 that's really f

633
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,000
 like where where

634
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,039
 would you go on planet

635
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,880
 earth if you were going to run away?

636
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,559
 well, that's exactly like my the source of my misunderstanding and my confusion here.

637
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:21,039
 so where i'm not running anywhere and you know i've been to dubai came back.

638
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,360
 so it's very hard for me to understand

639
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,440
 my role in being here because

640
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,480
 i'm required to answer some questions in relation to telegram every like

641
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,320
 fifth month or fourth month.

642
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,600
 so the other like 3 or 4 months i am just

643
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,039
 having to be here for reasons that are very hard for me to understand.

644
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,240
 what's their argument?

645
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,120
 i mean i'm just confused.

646
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,600
 so no one's actually despite the headlines

647
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,480
 that

648
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,200
 flooded the world in august when you were arrested,

649
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,799
 detained, whatever they're calling it, put in a cell.

650
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,760
 um you were not involved in kitty porn,

651
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,279
 drug sales,

652
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,120
 organized crime, arm, i can't even remember.

653
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,600
 but like the worst crimes in the world,

654
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,919
 no one is actually claiming you were involved in those crimes.

655
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:06,559
 correct.

656
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,200
 correct.

657
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,000
 okay.

658
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
 they're saying that you had

659
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
 of your billion users,

660
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,640
 there were a few who may have been doing bad things and you're saying,

661
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,960
 i tried, but i i didn't know that.

662
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,760
 it's not my fault.

663
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,240
 right.

664
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
 correct.

665
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,159
 it'd be like saying to donald trump, there are 350 million people in america.

666
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,039
 you know, onethird the number of users you have and

667
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,360
 some of them are using kitty porn or selling drugs or, you know, organized driving.

668
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,120
 we're putting you in jail for it.

669
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,440
 i mean, that's like it's insane.

670
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,559
 so, why are you still here?

671
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,320
 like, what is the claim against you?

672
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,880
 i'm still trying to find out to be to be honest.

673
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,240
 i'm i'm still confused.

674
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
 so, at first they said,

675
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:52,320
 "oh, you failed to respond to our legal requests and that's why you're complicit."

676
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,240
 but first of all, we

677
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,080
 it's not true that we didn't respond to legally binding legal requests.

678
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
 and secondly,

679
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:09,760
 it's a very u extensive interpretation of complicity even for the french

680
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,440
 you know legal and judicial system.

681
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,279
 what i'm what i hear from my lawyers is that it's quite unprecedented.

682
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:23,520
 they had a couple of really small niche apps that are like 10,000 smaller than telegram

683
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,440
 and were targeted specifically at criminals.

684
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,559
 they were nothing like they didn't even have these companies that they didn't even have bank

685
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,559
 accounts.

686
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,440
 they they it was a a different profile.

687
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,840
 they were not audited by big four organization.

688
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:48,440
 but it's these companies have been persecuted in france before and their

689
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
 founders

690
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
 i understand were accused of

691
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,960
 running a platform

692
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,919
 that

693
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,399
 is created for the purpose to facilitate

694
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,399
 crime.

695
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,480
 it's pretty much obvious that tilgrim is not such a company, right?

696
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,880
 so it's it's has a billion users.

697
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,480
 every eighth person on the planet is a user

698
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,159
 of telegram like a regular one and and it's it's incomprehensible

699
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,760
 to assume that all these people like people are criminals and and and

700
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,520
 you know everybody knows the story of telegram

701
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,200
 very well it's not something that

702
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
 was built for

703
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,120
 criminals

704
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
 however

705
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,720
 this reasoning as far as i understand is being

706
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,600
 used also in our case

707
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,799
 they say that all right so you

708
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,159
 created this app and this app was used by other people.

709
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,360
 they were criminals and you didn't do enough

710
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,960
 to prevent them

711
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
 from doing what they were doing.

712
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,559
 which again is is

713
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,919
 contrary to what we see on other platforms like you have instances

714
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,360
 where problematic content exists despite the best efforts

715
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,679
 of

716
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,600
 social media platforms moderation teams and so on and so forth.

717
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,120
 it's almost impossible to avoid that.

718
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,240
 but the claim itself just conceptually doesn't make sense.

719
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,880
 i mean, if someone commits armed robbery in burgundy or tulus or nice,

720
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,600
 can president mcronone be arrested for that because it's his country, he runs the country

721
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,480
 and he didn't do enough to stop the armed robbery in tulus?

722
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
 like, how can that stand?

723
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,880
 why isn't he in jail?

724
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,320
 like, that that's nuts.

725
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,200
 well, the logic also eludes me, so to say.

726
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,039
 back with the the russian understatement.

727
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,480
 no, i it's so look, here's the inescapable conclusion.

728
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,120
 i think as from a bystanders perspective

729
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,679
 that they do this in public rather than just calling you.

730
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,799
 so we have a problem we work it out or call your lawyers.

731
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,080
 they arrest you in public.

732
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,120
 they slander you.

733
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,840
 they try and tie you to the worst crimes

734
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,520
 man commits

735
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,520
 and then they put you in jail.

736
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,039
 um and so they're trying to sweat you to intimidate you

737
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,520
 um to wear you down in order to get

738
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,200
 into the back door of telegram so they can spy on

739
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,279
 people.

740
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,880
 probably really for political reasons.

741
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,840
 that's the what they're really worried about is a revolt in their own country.

742
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,799
 every government's really worried mostly about its own population revoling against this bad governance.

743
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,480
 like that's their real fear

744
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,840
 and they hate

745
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,760
 telegram because it offers users privacy and that's a threat to them

746
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,760
 and so they force you as the owner of the company to give them the keys.

747
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,200
 that's what it looks like.

748
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,200
 well, to be clear, nobody approached me with the demand to give the so-called keys.

749
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,519
 such keys don't exist technically, but if

750
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,000
 if

751
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,880
 somebody approaches me and says we need the keys,

752
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
 you'll be among the first to to

753
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,080
 learn about it.

754
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,760
 but that hasn't happened.

755
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,519
 well, actually the us government pushed you.

756
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,559
 i remember the fbi was trying to yeah.

757
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,200
 yeah.

758
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,640
 because this is something governments want, not just of you, but of all social media companies.

759
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,600
 you know what's interesting?

760
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,720
 in the us, you have a process

761
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,640
 that allows the government to actually force any engineer

762
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,080
 in any tech company

763
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,600
 to implement a backdoor

764
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,840
 and not tell anyone about it with using this process called the gag order.

765
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,799
 and

766
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,919
 there there are certain legal procedures, not tell his own employer about it

767
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,519
 and not yes, exactly.

768
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,159
 if you tell your own boss, you can end up in jail.

769
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,799
 like gag order this actually.

770
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,200
 yeah, this is something that it's on wikipedia in france.

771
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,600
 i in the soviet union or in the us?

772
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,919
 in the us.

773
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:37,840
 okay.

774
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,799
 i am not criticizing.

775
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,720
 so your employees have a legal obligation to act as fifth column spies,

776
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,679
 saboturs

777
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,039
 against you, your employees.

778
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,840
 well, that's the one of the reasons we didn't discuss last time why

779
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,000
 i didn't move to the us with my team.

780
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,559
 and you got mugged in san francisco on your one trip there.

781
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,159
 exactly.

782
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,640
 but but i i did this extensive legal analysis

783
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,720
 like i asked my lawyers, the us lawyers, what is this thing called the gag order?

784
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,399
 and they explained it to me and how it works and how it could potentially

785
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:08,880
 be

786
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,519
 applied.

787
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,200
 so we decided maybe not the best place for a privacy oriented platform.

788
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,919
 but here in france, we really don't know

789
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,799
 because there there are a lot of conspiracy theories about it.

790
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:21,840
 and at first i thought

791
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,320
 i i

792
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,880
 also started

793
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,600
 to be concerned

794
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,000
 like

795
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
 what is this about?

796
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,480
 but then when the french

797
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,960
 police and the french judges started to

798
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,600
 send their requests in accordance to the european law to telegram

799
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,440
 and receive the identification data, meaning the ip address of criminal suspects,

800
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,720
 they seem to become very happy.

801
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,000
 they expressed their joy in the press.

802
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,880
 they said, "oh, tilgrim is now cooperating."

803
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,360
 all of a sudden, as if it was something new.

804
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,120
 can i ask you to pause when when they said that?

805
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,399
 i remember that very well.

806
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,240
 yeah.

807
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,159
 that sounded to me like they were trying to discredit

808
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:02,880
 you

809
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,039
 and were sending the message cuz they were not specific.

810
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,279
 they just said they're cooperating.

811
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,440
 and that made it sound to the rest of the world like, "oh, they broke pavle.

812
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,918
 they hung him by his ankles and burned him with galwis

813
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,839
 until he finally gave up and

814
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,320
 turned over the the back end to them and now they're spying on all telegram users.

815
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,399
 you're cooperating like you would in east germany in 1975. that's that's what it sounded like.

816
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:26,719
 yeah.

817
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,839
 that's why it's so important to clarify this because this perception

818
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,079
 is not only bad for telegram, it's even worse for for the image of france

819
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,000
 because if you if you think about it, it's france is still

820
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,918
 a land where

821
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,560
 laws and legal procedures should be

822
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
 adhered to

823
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,079
 and even in this case if you want

824
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,480
 additional access

825
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,000
 to certain data, personal data, it has to be done in accordance with laws.

826
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,079
 and then every company for example us we never disclosed private messaging data

827
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,480
 to any third party including governments

828
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,640
 and if it's in some country they would say you have to do it

829
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,960
 we would discontinue providing services in that country then doing it.

830
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
 isn't that why you left russia in the first place?

831
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,599
 yes.

832
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:13,200
 so you've been through this.

833
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,240
 you left your own country because you refused to give up the privacy of the user.

834
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,280
 yeah.

835
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,520
 but here it's catch it's catching up because last month

836
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,079
 the senate here in france passed a law basically banning

837
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:30,079
 encryption.

838
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,320
 this law was

839
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,200
 forcing all messaging app providers to implement the backd dooror for the french law enforcement

840
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,359
 to to fight crime.

841
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,000
 the problem here was fight crime.

842
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
 well they exactly because the problem here was there is no such thing as an exclusive

843
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,160
 backdoor.

844
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,920
 if you implement the back door,

845
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,160
 technically other

846
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 actors

847
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,200
 are able to

848
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,000
 exploit it

849
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,280
 and it could be foreign agents, it could be hackers, it could be anyone.

850
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,880
 so that law would have put millions of people or tens of millions of of french

851
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,320
 citizens in danger.

852
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,720
 the their private messages would would have been exposed.

853
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,160
 the criminals however would would have instantly switched to niche

854
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,280
 smaller apps

855
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,720
 not mainstream apps

856
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,040
 and if the government was tried to

857
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,079
 would try to ban this apps they would switch to vpns

858
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,079
 they would they would even become more efficient in hiding their traces.

859
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:37,440
 so the criminals would experience zero problems if that law is passed.

860
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,000
 is the law-abiding

861
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 citizens

862
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,880
 who would be affected and that's why it's so problematic and nobody was talking about it.

863
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,920
 and asked my french friends like, "have you heard about this law?" like they no,

864
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,400
 they were completely unaware.

865
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,880
 and luckily the national assembly here in france shot that bill down.

866
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,119
 so it didn't pass this time.

867
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,760
 but if you look at the u new project by the eu by the european commission

868
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,320
 published in early april,

869
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,920
 they again

870
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,440
 want to do exactly that to backdoor encryption

871
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,400
 but now on the eu level

872
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,520
 and and that raises many serious questions because

873
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,079
 no country in the world

874
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,280
 banned encryption so far even the the places that you would consider authoritarian places

875
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,200
 for reasons that i just described.

876
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,800
 this it's just a huge threat for the entire population

877
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,400
 to for all users for all users to

878
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,160
 legally force companies to implement backd doorors.

879
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,640
 so i think it's very important that people talk about these things first of all that

880
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,880
 france is not

881
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,880
 an a a country where freedoms are disrespected

882
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,119
 right for for example if people assume that france can now take ceos of

883
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,160
 tech companies

884
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,839
 um hostage in in such a way that you that you describe

885
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,040
 and then extract certain personal data from them using

886
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,160
 illegal and unlawful

887
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
 processes.

888
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,720
 that would be a big big blow for the image of france.

889
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,440
 but i don't think we're there because we haven't chip away at this concept of

890
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,320
 the rules-based

891
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
 order.

892
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,680
 the rules-based order, which everyone in nato is always lecturing everybody else about the rules-based order.

893
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,920
 there's nothing rules-based about what they did to you.

894
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,480
 i'm sorry.

895
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,560
 i mean, that's just that's might makes right.

896
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
 that's we have guns and you don't.

897
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
 it's our airport, not yours.

898
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,359
 you're going to jail.

899
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,240
 i just don't see the legal justification for doing this to anybody.

900
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,400
 it was excessive in my view, but it was also a sign that

901
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
 um

902
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,599
 again in my view this investigation was not based on

903
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,880
 thorough analysis of what telegram represents

904
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
 and and

905
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,320
 what the goals of the company are.

906
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,960
 and again they has been no attempt and they had

907
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,520
 didn't even try

908
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
 to

909
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,320
 solve this in a more

910
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,560
 traditional conventional way

911
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,880
 before starting a legal way actually a legal and diplomatic way.

912
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,720
 what did they do with your phone?

913
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,000
 well, they just kept my phone.

914
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,680
 i hope they they

915
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,440
 scrutinize it because there they have a lot of proof

916
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,680
 that actually telegram

917
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,440
 is a completely

918
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,240
 legitimate and compliant organization and we have spent

919
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,839
 huge funds on

920
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,880
 content moderation and legal compliance all over the world since like 10 years ago.

921
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,880
 so they're welcome to have my phone.

922
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,839
 who sells your bonds?

923
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:52,400
 um yeah.

924
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,760
 so, telgram issued bonds a few years ago.

925
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,599
 we were happy to have the assistance of jp morgan, the the world's biggest bank, right?

926
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,640
 and world's biggest bank.

927
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,599
 so, i just i only asked

928
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,920
 i knew that and i just wanted you to say it because

929
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,520
 just to underscore the point.

930
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,440
 this is you're not like some,

931
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,880
 you know, bellow russian college student doing this out of your room or something.

932
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,839
 this like this like a worldwide huge company.

933
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,200
 it's just absolutely crazy.

934
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,000
 and it doesn't have as deep penetration in the united states

935
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,440
 as it does in the rest of the world.

936
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,480
 so, i just i just want people to know this is not some sketchy deal.

937
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,400
 this is like i can't just can't believe they did that.

938
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,680
 where are you now in the process?

939
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:43,599
 so, the process is not going too fast, but this is the tradition here in france.

940
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,280
 so, i'm not now, i'm just visiting for a couple days.

941
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,000
 you think i'll get out of here?

942
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,920
 so the i haven't been granted a fast track in my case.

943
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,119
 um and and you know i' i've just seen my investigative judges.

944
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,720
 they have this role of investigative judges here in france.

945
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,280
 so my current status is i'm not on trial.

946
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,720
 it's an investigation

947
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:22,960
 intended to find out whether there'll be enough evidence to put this on trial.

948
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,480
 so, i'm not even on trial yet.

949
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,720
 there's but you're basically imprisoned in france.

950
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:31,520
 but i well, i'm not imprisoned, but can you can you leave whenever you want?

951
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,040
 i can't leave france freely.

952
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,079
 that's true.

953
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,839
 uh, so what how is that not imprisoned?

954
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,960
 um, well, i mean that i mean there are great restaurants.

955
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,400
 i'm not you know what i mean?

956
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,680
 it's not a commissary

957
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,319
 with

958
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,920
 guys with face tattoos, but you if you can't leave, then aren't you by definition imprisoned?

959
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
 you could say so.

960
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,960
 i just don't want to create this image

961
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,920
 of a real prison

962
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,880
 in in the minds

963
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,920
 of our viewers.

964
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
 this is i don't know if anyone can see the cell we're in.

965
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:59,920
 it's pretty nice room service and everything.

966
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,880
 i mean, no, it's france.

967
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,640
 it's it's like very first world in some ways, but not in its attitudes.

968
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,079
 i'm i'm learning.

969
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,079
 um, so how long will that continue?

970
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,960
 and and you've got

971
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,960
 children,

972
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,960
 you know, and a life and a business and friends and family and

973
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,560
 they're not in france as far as i know.

974
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,280
 though.

975
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,480
 yes, they're all in dubai and i have

976
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,319
 kids in dubai that i am unable to

977
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:27,119
 not just see i'm unable to

978
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,480
 legally take care of them by signing certain documents i have to sign and

979
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,440
 i've

980
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,480
 you know it's it's

981
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
 been

982
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,680
 very stressful also for my mom for my mom

983
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,040
 who is gravely ill and i can't see her.

984
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,000
 um i also have this company to run.

985
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,440
 we have a billion users.

986
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,000
 it's it's it's it's

987
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 important

988
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,760
 and i am doing it remotely now but it's not as efficient.

989
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,000
 so if you if you think about it, france is less than 1%

990
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,240
 of the telegram user base.

991
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,200
 it's it's some something like half of 1%.

992
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,440
 and the other 99 and a half% are coming from elsewhere, right?

993
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,440
 india, indonesia, you name it.

994
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,560
 and it's kind of counterintuitive for me

995
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:24,240
 that the entire organization is impacted because we have this ongoing investigation here in france.

996
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,119
 particularly given the fact that

997
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,640
 it's going

998
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,839
 in a pace

999
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,359
 that only requires me to be here once like in in in several months.

1000
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,079
 um so i do think that the current restriction is

1001
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,720
 um very strange and very unnecessary and i hope it will be lifted later this year.

1002
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,400
 and if it's not

1003
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,839
 your identity is constantly under attack and just the last year americans lost over 16 billion

1004
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,280
 to scammers online.

1005
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,680
 anyone can fall victim to this.

1006
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,480
 your social security

1007
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:58,800
 number,

1008
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,440
 your bank account,

1009
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,319
 your credit profile

1010
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:00,960
 can be exposed

1011
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,800
 and you won't even know it.

1012
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,640
 and the second they are exposed,

1013
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,599
 thieves can take out loans in your name, open credit cards, wreck your life financially.

1014
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,880
 identity guard can save you.

1015
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,079
 identity guard monitors

1016
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,599
 everything from your credit card to your bank accounts to your social security number,

1017
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,680
 looking for early signs of fraud before

1018
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,800
 damage is done.

1019
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,760
 if something weird happens, you get an instant alert.

1020
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,839
 if someone does steal your identity, identity guard's expert team works directly with banks,

1021
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,560
 credit card companies, and lenders to shut it down quickly.

1022
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,000
 end the scam.

1023
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,480
 having your identity stolen is a nightmare.

1024
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:37,800
 someone in this country becomes a victim of identity the theft every six seconds.

1029
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,560
 you're probably pretty sick in nike.

1030
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,000
 it's hard to blame you for feeling that way.

1031
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,119
 any company that worships colin kaepernick,

1032
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,119
 any company that shills for the lunacy of the left social agenda

1033
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:00,400
 is clearly not on your side.

1034
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,920
 in fact, they're your enemy.

1035
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,280
 you need an alternative.

1036
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,920
 xxxy athletics is the far better choice.

1037
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,440
 it's the only athletic brand committed to fighting fighting for free speech, women's sports,

1038
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,119
 and the truth.

1039
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,800
 honesty, the truth.

1040
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,160
 they're not going to lie to you.

1041
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,680
 for example, did you know that 80% of americans oppose letting men play in women's sports?

1042
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
 that's not a radical view.

1043
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,440
 it's a moderate, sensible view rooted in biology.

1044
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,640
 but woke corporations like nike make you feel like a lunatic

1045
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,920
 for saying obvious things like men are men and women are women.

1046
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,839
 that is tyranny.

1047
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:39,040
 how can you fight back?

1048
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,359
 by abandoning the companies promoting it and by embracing companies like xxxy athletics.

1049
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,359
 it's an american company.

1050
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,079
 it's not opposed to the united states or to telling the truth.

1051
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,920
 head to the truthfits.com

1052
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,200
 to learn a lot more and use the code tucker25

1053
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,880
 for 25% off.

1054
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,599
 well, let's see.

1055
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,200
 because first of all, this investigation can't last forever.

1056
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,520
 they it can probably last for another several

1057
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,200
 months or a year and then it will have to either go

1058
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,720
 on trial or

1059
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,440
 be concluded.

1060
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,839
 you could be criminally charged for this.

1061
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,359
 everything is possible.

1062
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,119
 like you can't rule out.

1063
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,319
 guess if they'd arrest you at the airport, they'd do anything, right?

1064
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,680
 that's what bothered me when i was in police custody for these four days.

1065
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,160
 like first thing, something like this should have never happened because

1066
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,880
 i assumed there were certain

1067
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,480
 thorough procedures

1068
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,280
 to verify a lot of

1069
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,839
 u alleged facts before taking a decision such as this.

1070
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,200
 like you can't start something like this based on a in a media article that

1071
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,200
 telegram

1072
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,359
 allegedly is non-ooperative

1073
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,359
 or that telegram

1074
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:56,000
 supposedly has worse

1075
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,440
 content moderation

1076
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,440
 than other platforms.

1077
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,520
 both these facts turned out to be completely false.

1078
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,160
 you have to be really thorough

1079
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:11,119
 and examine things before making this decision because this the decisions such as this

1080
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,960
 are not only harmful

1081
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,839
 for for my relatives or for my company of my for me personally.

1082
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,920
 decisions such as this i think impact france as a whole

1083
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,520
 and as i'm a french i'm a french citizen so i worry about that as well.

1084
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:35,920
 i really think that out of all social media platforms, telegram was probably the most friendly

1085
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,160
 potential partner for france.

1086
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,000
 and every time

1087
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,480
 anyone

1088
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,240
 from from the french government,

1089
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,160
 the french authorities reached out to me,

1090
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,440
 i did my best to help.

1091
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,760
 i helped.

1092
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:54,319
 so this for me looked almost like friendly fire like where they're they're

1093
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,800
 trying to attack their own ally

1094
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,960
 in a way and i was so surprised that this would happen

1095
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:03,920
 because

1096
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,520
 the collateral damage

1097
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,520
 not just for me and my company but for the image of france

1098
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,920
 is quite significant and i

1099
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,680
 talked to many of my friends the ceo of big tech companies

1100
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,160
 and they were very concerned and asked me can i still come to france?

1101
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,240
 is it like is it still safe to be in france?

1102
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,160
 people were worried and and the ceos of the smaller companies

1103
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,800
 that don't have a billion users are even more worried.

1104
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,520
 they say

1105
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,000
 look

1106
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,760
 they did this to you and you

1107
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,720
 you're very well known and the company of your profile is

1108
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,160
 you know

1109
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,720
 should be treated in in certainly in in certain different way.

1110
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,800
 so, and i'm running a small startup.

1111
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,880
 a friend of of mine would say, "i'm scared to come."

1112
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,960
 and you know, this trend continues.

1113
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,480
 so, i heard,

1114
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,119
 but there's the sad thing is like nobody's afraid to go to usbekistsan actually.

1115
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,559
 i'm not endorsing usbekistan.

1116
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,240
 i've never been there, but i

1117
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,119
 never met anyone who's like, "i'm too afraid to go to usbekistsan."

1118
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,559
 yeah, i was there last summer.

1119
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,000
 it was great.

1120
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,200
 i didn't even know that.

1121
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,400
 but that's the point.

1122
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,599
 i mean

1123
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,720
 right these countries that you grew up thinking are

1124
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,839
 primitive or don't have functioning legal systems or

1125
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:16,319
 you know whose

1126
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,400
 laws are really just a function of the whim of the monarch

1127
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,680
 or whatever

1128
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,520
 they turn out to be kind of fine with

1129
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,440
 what you do or what i do or what any

1130
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:25,760
 normal

1131
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,079
 person

1132
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,160
 who believes in human rights does but it's like

1133
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:28,640
 france

1134
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,920
 or great britain

1135
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,480
 like didn't you get citizenship here thinking

1136
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:32,800
 this

1137
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:33,680
 was a safe haven

1138
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,880
 as someone who was in

1139
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,079
 some sense kind of a refugee

1140
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,599
 from his own country

1141
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:38,160
 a refugee

1142
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:38,880
 do you have principle

1143
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,319
 like i don't want to share this with the government

1144
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:40,920
 i'm

1145
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,920
 leaving?

1146
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,720
 didn't you

1147
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,160
 choose this country for citizenship

1148
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,559
 because you thought that it was a place that was committed to human rights?

1149
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:54,160
 well, the slogan of france is liberty equality, right?

1150
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,200
 so, equality.

1151
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:03,400
 so, it's it's something that i strongly believe in and it's certainly something that

1152
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,400
 france

1153
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,720
 stands for in my

1154
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,359
 in my opinion and for pretty much everybody who was born in the soviet union

1155
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,440
 like i was

1156
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,839
 western europe

1157
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:21,359
 is considered to be this place where freedoms and human rights are respected

1158
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:23,839
 and and

1159
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:31,200
 that's why it was such a shock for me back there in the police custody.

1160
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,160
 interestingly,

1161
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,680
 the interpreter that we had during this four days in police custody

1162
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,839
 also immigrated from the soviet union.

1163
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,599
 she was translating english to french and back.

1164
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,960
 and after being present there for 2 days,

1165
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,760
 she

1166
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,400
 said during a break with all the policemen and

1167
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,599
 you know, clerks and everybody present there and she said, "i left the soviet

1168
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:07,680
 union hoping i would be in a country with freedoms."

1169
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,920
 and and it seems now that the soviet union has caught up with me.

1170
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,800
 and

1171
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,599
 i've

1172
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,440
 what so i was very surprised to hear her say that

1173
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,440
 because for me france is not there yet.

1174
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:26,000
 france is still the country that respects human rights and freedoms.

1175
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,040
 however, i understood i later understood why she was so sensitive to this because she actually

1176
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,040
 experienced

1177
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,200
 what life is like

1178
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,040
 in an environment

1179
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:43,119
 where you don't have freedom of speech and you you don't have a free market economy.

1180
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:53,359
 and that's why every perceived change for in in this direction where freedoms are less respected

1181
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:58,880
 um is is taking very is making them very very concerned people from the soviet union.

1182
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,680
 and i myself

1183
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,240
 i remember my life i was a small kid in the soviet

1184
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,559
 union but i remember

1185
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:11,599
 having only three tv channels and all these three tv channels show the same tv program

1186
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:14,319
 with the about the communist party

1187
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,119
 and i remember having two kinds of ice cream in the shops

1188
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,079
 across the city and across the country and no more.

1189
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,359
 and then when i was brought to italy as a five-year-old

1190
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,000
 kid

1191
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,400
 and i could see, okay, actually i could have 100 tv channels

1192
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,800
 and some of them even show

1193
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,160
 disney cartoons and japanese

1194
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,160
 anime.

1195
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,040
 that's great.

1196
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,599
 i can go to a shop downstairs and they have 200 different kinds of ice cream.

1197
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,160
 that's much better that i experienced in the soviet union.

1198
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,119
 and i thought maybe these things

1199
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,200
 afterwards i realized that this

1200
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:51,839
 systems

1201
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,960
 called the free market economy and and respect to freedom of speech and basic human rights

1202
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,240
 they're actually very good concepts because they make your life abundant.

1203
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:07,760
 but the problem is i remember this this life in the absence of of these things.

1204
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:14,319
 other people from the soviet union probably from cuba from other countries like that experience that.

1205
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,839
 people who were born and grew up here, for example, in france,

1206
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,319
 have not necessarily had this experience.

1207
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,920
 they take freedoms for granted.

1208
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,040
 they think it's

1209
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,640
 things are going going to be fine because we're a free country and what can possibly

1210
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,160
 go

1211
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,160
 wrong?

1212
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:38,319
 unfortunately, the history knows many examples when free societies gradually degraded into societies without freedoms.

1213
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:43,680
 and one good example was last month with this anti- encryption law.

1214
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,400
 i told you before about because people were completely ignorant here in france.

1215
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,800
 the public was completely ignorant.

1216
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,359
 so no encryption means no privacy.

1217
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:53,760
 yes.

1218
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,079
 correct.

1219
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:02,160
 it means everybody's vulnerable like everybody's messages can leak can can can it's mindboggling.

1220
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,680
 and of course every time something like this is proposed very

1221
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,800
 um logically sounding justifications are used to protect the children.

1222
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,160
 to protect the children, to fight crime, to

1223
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,160
 you know neither of which they bother doing

1224
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,319
 by the way they don't care about children

1225
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,920
 and they don't stop crime

1226
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,119
 or in the soviet union they would say like in mao is china

1227
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,520
 and other places they would say oh our geopolitical

1228
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,160
 rival is trying to stir chaos in our country so we have to limit

1229
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,680
 this it's qatar doing it it's russia

1230
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,960
 it's qatar

1231
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,520
 so yeah i don't know

1232
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,800
 but but but

1233
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,200
 it's always some troskyite wreckers.

1234
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,200
 it's some unseen force from a foreign land trying to wreck our project.

1235
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,079
 so, we need to oppress you to keep you safe.

1236
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:50,960
 yes.

1237
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,800
 but it's not easy because now in the european union, you have all these laws

1238
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,800
 that basically say you have to remove anything.

1239
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,119
 it's actually part of the digital services act.

1240
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,440
 you have to remove anything one of the european countries

1241
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:13,599
 demands you remove for the entire of the diet of the european union.

1242
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,640
 so if you have for example romania or estonia or any of other of this

1243
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,800
 very highly respected countries

1244
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,720
 demanding that you remove like most of telegram channels for whatever reason

1245
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,480
 you have to remove them then you can appeal

1246
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,200
 well it will take you probably several years

1247
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:40,160
 but you have to remove them within like i very short time frame

1248
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,520
 otherwise you'll be facing

1249
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,200
 fines, bans, and so on.

1250
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,640
 how is it not the warsaw pact?

1251
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,160
 i mean, how is that not soviet?

1252
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,799
 if you criticize the people in charge, we shut you down.

1253
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,880
 that's what they're saying.

1254
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,960
 interesting you would say that.

1255
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:02,680
 it was in 2009, 2008. actually, i made my first dream trip to

1256
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,160
 latvia on a train from st.

1257
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,640
 petersburg and something was wrong with my visa.

1258
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,880
 so i had to get off in the border town in latia.

1259
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,720
 but i had this long discussion with a border police officer.

1260
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,760
 well, i seem to like border policemen.

1261
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,280
 so border police officer in latia and i started to discuss his life in latia

1262
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,839
 after latia was accepted in the eu.

1263
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,559
 and he told me this interesting thing.

1264
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:35,280
 and he said, "you know, we hated being in the soviet union,

1265
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,440
 but now that we are in the eu, we realize

1266
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,400
 we

1267
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,760
 are in a

1268
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:45,760
 very similar organization." of course, we're in the soviet union again.

1269
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,480
 unelected foreigners are still making the key decisions and you don't get to talk.

1270
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,359
 so, it's very funny you would compare this two systems.

1271
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,280
 of course, they're very different.

1272
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,880
 but still, but fundamentally,

1273
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,079
 if you're not allowed to criticize the people in charge,

1274
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,319
 you live in a tyranny.

1275
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,040
 i mean, what what's the other definition of it?

1276
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,400
 i have to be able to say to the person making the decisions,

1277
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,839
 i don't like that decision, and here's why.

1278
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,680
 and i have to be able to say it in public.

1279
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,040
 and i've always felt the problem that you have

1280
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,440
 as the person who owns and runs telegram

1281
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,559
 is that you make it easy for people to come together online.

1282
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:22,400
 you have the channels

1283
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,200
 and that is

1284
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,960
 i don't know if you thought this through and you

1285
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,680
 you're an engineer when you when you built

1286
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,680
 it

1287
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,960
 but that is potentially a massive threat to governments

1288
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,559
 because it's not simply communicating one-on-one there

1289
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,319
 you know people can create their own well

1290
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:36,799
 channels

1291
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,520
 just like a tv channel and reach a lot of like-minded

1292
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,920
 people and they could potentially organize

1293
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,119
 organize

1294
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,599
 that's true but one thing that makes telegram different we don't promote these channels so

1295
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,240
 everything that you have on telegram

1296
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,319
 is something that you have to deliberately search for and subscribe for.

1297
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:54,720
 yes.

1298
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,240
 so unlike some other apps that

1299
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,240
 constantly

1300
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:02,559
 recommend you content and content sources, we don't do that.

1301
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,760
 you open telegram, it's just an empty list of chats.

1302
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,880
 if you don't have any friend there and if you

1303
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,599
 are not subscribed to any channel, you have to deliberately

1304
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:12,559
 find one.

1305
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,359
 so i think we're completely neutral platform.

1306
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,079
 we allow everybody to express their voice within the

1307
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,760
 the rules of the you know common sense

1308
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,319
 and and then everybody can

1309
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,280
 decide

1310
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,119
 which point of view makes more sense to them

1311
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,040
 and

1312
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:38,079
 see if if for example the government is right or their position is right.

1313
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:38,480
 right.

1314
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,680
 well that's called freedom.

1315
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,160
 that's called freedom.

1316
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,799
 unfortunately, it's something that surprisingly

1317
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:48,240
 um faces a lot of backlash.

1318
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,680
 may i ask you a question about encryption?

1319
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:57,680
 so, the advances in computing power, well, they're calling it quantum computing, right?

1320
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,839
 so, they're just so exponential

1321
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:02,559
 that it's hard even to understand for the non-engineer

1322
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,200
 brain like mine, but they're they're profound.

1323
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,079
 the speed at which processes are now occurring.

1324
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,680
 does that eliminate what is the techn what is the technological state of play?

1325
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,319
 does that eliminate encryption?

1326
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,599
 encryption will have to change.

1327
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:16,240
 correct.

1328
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,240
 the encryption has to change and there has been made progress in

1329
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,280
 encryption which is like quantum secure.

1330
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,359
 so it's a constant evolution.

1331
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,799
 so the the the tools to decrypt

1332
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:36,480
 become stronger and then the tools to encrypt become stronger.

1333
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,200
 that makes sense.

1334
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,480
 are you confident that

1335
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,480
 encryption

1336
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,359
 that secure encryption will still exist

1337
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:45,599
 as a technological matter

1338
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,079
 with the rise of the super fast quantum computing?

1339
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,520
 it's very hard to be confident in anything because

1340
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,160
 first of all we have to rely on the computing power of our devices

1341
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,760
 to decrypt things.

1342
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:06,480
 of course there are very sophisticated algorithms in place that

1343
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,599
 make it so that you don't have to have the same

1344
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,720
 level of computing power on your device

1345
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,559
 as in a data center

1346
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,880
 to say you don't have to bring a data center with you.

1347
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:17,119
 yeah.

1348
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:17,440
 exactly.

1349
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,359
 so it it's it's not exactly like that.

1350
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,160
 build a nuclear power plant, buy 100 acres.

1351
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:27,040
 you don't have to but you know it continues.

1352
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,720
 so the the

1353
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,520
 particular state actors have almost infinite

1354
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,720
 computing power at their disposal and they have certain technologies

1355
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,400
 at their disposal that they may not be

1356
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,160
 telling everybody about.

1357
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,160
 so they might not be telling people about it.

1358
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,599
 so it's very possible that what you're saying will become reality or is already reality.

1359
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,119
 who knows?

1360
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:51,760
 so

1361
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,240
 um

1362
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:52,480
 so

1363
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:52,720
 that

1364
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,200
 kind of is

1365
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:53,680
 one of the

1366
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:53,920
 and

1367
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,240
 i don't

1368
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,119
 you know i know you

1369
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,079
 have

1370
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,119
 well you're legally bound here in france so you're under some kind of

1371
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:01,920
 state control.

1372
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,760
 so and i know your life is complicated because of it.

1373
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,559
 so i don't want to

1374
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:07,520
 push you to say things or to get you in trouble but

1375
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,240
 um it does feel like a a determined government can spy on anybody it wants to.

1376
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,359
 that's the way it feels to me.

1377
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,559
 do you think that's true?

1378
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,480
 well, i think the biggest risk for personal privacy is

1379
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,480
 um

1380
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,000
 the ability of any state actor to penetrate

1381
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,599
 the device of the person, the mobile device for example, because there are so-called zero day

1382
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:34,079
 vulnerabilities on ios or android

1383
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,720
 phones for example, that the governments

1384
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,599
 sometimes know about and the secret agencies know about and they can exploit them.

1385
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,280
 but everybody else doesn't know and they can't defend from them themselves from them.

1386
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:51,359
 so if you became a target of a government,

1387
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:56,160
 it's really likely that they would install this

1388
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,680
 trojan so-called trojan called pegasus on your device.

1389
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,839
 and i was one of these people

1390
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:03,440
 eight years ago

1391
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:09,040
 that had a pegasus installed on their phones according to the leaked reports.

1392
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,160
 been there.

1393
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:10,559
 um,

1394
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:11,520
 is there any way,

1395
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,200
 and i think a lot of people are there without

1396
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,920
 knowing it,

1397
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,880
 and i i'm

1398
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:15,839
 know that.

1399
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:22,000
 is there any way to know if your phone has been compromised?

1400
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,480
 if

1401
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:22,880
 what

1402
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:23,280
 you're

1403
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,400
 looking at and typing

1404
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,680
 is being read by somebody else, is there any way to know for certain?

1405
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,240
 for certain, probably no.

1406
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:39,160
 but there are ways to check that and see if known vulnerabilities have been

1407
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,559
 um

1408
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:42,400
 exploited on your phone

1409
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,520
 and and i know there are some organizations that can help you with that.

1410
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,799
 i'll where's your phone?

1411
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:48,160
 did you didn't leave it out?

1412
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,119
 i don't use a phone.

1413
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,520
 i haven't used the phone for from for a year almost.

1414
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,440
 i find oh, france took it.

1415
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,480
 oh, france took it.

1416
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,839
 but even before it took it, i wasn't using my phone.

1417
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,680
 i didn't have a sim card in the phone.

1418
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:05,440
 i just use it to test telegram the app because we have constant product updates.

1419
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,240
 i have to test it like at least twice a week.

1420
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:11,280
 but i don't i i'm not a user of a phone.

1421
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,359
 so i just want to say again, you're an engineer, too.

1422
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,799
 i mean, you're not like a marketing guy.

1423
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,119
 you're like a build the app guy.

1424
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,640
 so you understand the technology.

1425
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:19,119
 yes.

1426
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:20,079
 because you built it.

1427
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:20,400
 yes.

1428
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:25,760
 so you're coming from a a highly informed perspective when you make technology choices.

1429
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,039
 is that fair?

1430
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:27,920
 you could say so.

1431
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,880
 yeah.

1432
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,400
 one of the most informed probably in the world.

1433
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,240
 and you don't have a phone.

1434
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,039
 what is that like?

1435
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,000
 why don't you have a phone?

1436
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,920
 well, i don't use phone regularly, right?

1437
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,799
 i probably own a phone, but i don't use phone.

1438
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:44,160
 i don't carry a phone with me because i find it extremely distracting.

1439
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,559
 i find it also

1440
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,319
 um potentially

1441
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,079
 um

1442
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,839
 um harming my privacy.

1443
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:52,480
 mhm.

1444
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,760
 and

1445
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:54,640
 i i i

1446
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,200
 also

1447
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,359
 just i i don't think it's a necessary device for me to have when

1448
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:00,960
 i want to focus on something.

1449
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,200
 i would rather use my laptop or my ipad

1450
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:10,880
 and and put together some notes or or or some u interact with my team, right?

1451
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:18,880
 so i wouldn't want to just open my phone and disappear there consuming short form content.

1452
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,880
 and that's why i don't use a phone.

1453
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,880
 i i'm i

1454
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,880
 trying to extract this from you for one simple reason which is i think that

1455
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:32,079
 when you come across someone who knows an immense amount about technology really understands the technology

1456
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:35,119
 it's interesting to know his perspective on technology

1457
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,960
 like with everything you know

1458
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,240
 you don't use a phone

1459
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,720
 so i just think you know people can draw their own conclusions

1460
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,359
 from that right

1461
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:51,520
 so what do you you saw ross albertch got the guy who was pardoned.

1462
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,160
 yes.

1463
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:52,880
 yeah.

1464
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,000
 silk road.

1465
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,280
 mhm.

1466
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,319
 so, he ran silk road and i'm hardly an expert on this.

1467
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:01,079
 i was very pleased when he got pardoned.

1468
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:06,559
 um, but it seemed like no one accused him of selling drugs, by the way.

1469
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,760
 you know, you would never know that from

1470
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,599
 the new york times, but he was not like dealing

1471
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:10,400
 drugs on playgrounds

1472
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,039
 or anything like that.

1473
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,039
 he had a site

1474
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:18,079
 um that made commerce possible outside the control of government

1475
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,720
 and there apparently were bad people doing bad things on it.

1476
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,039
 also

1477
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:21,760
 a lot of good people doing

1478
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,359
 good things on it but it was none of it was controlled

1479
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:23,920
 by the government

1480
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,079
 and he got life in prison for that.

1481
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,799
 that's my takeaway.

1482
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:28,799
 and

1483
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,559
 so maybe there will all

1484
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:32,559
 my

1485
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,319
 sort of conclusion from this is

1486
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,720
 as long as people like you create technology

1487
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,400
 that makes it harder for government to control people, you will be a target

1488
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,000
 of government action.

1489
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 you think that's it?

1490
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,960
 well, first of all, i wouldn't necessarily compare

1491
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,359
 teleg with silk and i'm not and i didn't mean to.

1492
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,119
 but i but the but the idea

1493
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:55,119
 that

1494
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,720
 the idea that

1495
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,920
 they need to

1496
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,160
 control everything that is happening online

1497
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,720
 and if they can't they're going to punish you.

1498
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,280
 that does seem like a real fact.

1499
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:11,359
 i think everybody's trying to reach their goals and be more efficient in what they do.

1500
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:13,680
 for example, you ask

1501
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,520
 any minister of interior,

1502
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:20,559
 any head of police, and they'll tell you, "oh, encryption is a big problem."

1503
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,079
 if it weren't for encryption, we would solve all crime.

1504
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,319
 they they don't see it two steps or three steps ahead.

1505
01:06:28,319 --> 01:06:29,200
 yes.

1506
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,799
 and it's not necessarily like some huge conspiracy where

1507
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:36,000
 like evil governments wants to want to take more and more control.

1508
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,119
 although that may be the case.

1509
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:39,680
 i'm not knowledgeable on that subject.

1510
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,000
 it's it seems to me more like everybody is trying to

1511
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,960
 solve

1512
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,440
 the problems that they see

1513
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,480
 using the tools that they have at their disposal

1514
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:52,000
 even if

1515
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,920
 it negatively impacts

1516
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,720
 other areas, you know, of our lives.

1517
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,839
 you're a very generous man, i must say.

1518
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:01,920
 last question, and thank you for doing this.

1519
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,880
 um how long are you going to be in france?

1520
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,079
 and once you leave france, will you be coming back to france?

1521
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,799
 i don't know yet when these restrictions will be lifted.

1522
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:17,039
 i hope later this year we'll be able to travel to

1523
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,119
 my home country which is dubai

1524
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:21,119
 freely.

1525
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:21,960
 i

1526
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:29,960
 um i will probably come back to france because it's it's a great place

1527
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:32,799
 to spend time in.

1528
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,319
 of course.

1529
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:37,599
 i had a lot of i have spent a lot of time in france now

1530
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,400
 eight eight months.

1531
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,960
 um so

1532
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:42,720
 um kind of a full immersion program.

1533
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,640
 how's your french?

1534
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,680
 it's it's actually good.

1535
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:50,160
 i was very good when i passed my french exam to receive the passport.

1536
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:55,359
 it got 97 points out of 100. but i didn't practice my french much.

1537
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:59,119
 most of my friends are americans.

1538
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,559
 but even here in paris and and and and and my french friends speak perfect english.

1539
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,960
 so i didn't got a chance to practice.

1540
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,200
 u but now you've had that chance?

1541
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,039
 no, because i speak english with me.

1542
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,000
 it's it's it changed.

1543
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,839
 like before 15 years ago, 20 years ago,

1544
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:21,439
 it was difficult not to speak french in france.

1545
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:25,839
 now for better or worse, you can get by using english.

1546
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,319
 i'm trying to use my french,

1547
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:28,640
 but

1548
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,439
 i don't sound

1549
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:29,759
 as

1550
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:30,158
 in

1551
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,439
 i sound even less intelligent

1552
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:32,319
 in in french

1553
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:33,120
 than in english.

1554
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,120
 so, people switch back to english with me.

1555
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,080
 but you don't anticipate like having to stay for the next 20 years or anything here.

1556
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,279
 i i would be very surprised if that happened because you see, i'm traveling to dubai.

1557
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:48,158
 i'm coming back.

1558
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:55,600
 it's it's just obvious that i'm not a somebody who would try to escape forever.

1559
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,839
 and

1560
01:08:56,839 --> 01:08:57,839
 um

1561
01:08:57,839 --> 01:09:02,719
 and it's that this investigation has to be concluded in why one way or the other.

1562
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:07,040
 of course, then if it goes to trial, if that happens, it can take another

1563
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,640
 several years.

1564
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,679
 but then again, it would be completely

1565
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,279
 um crazy.

1566
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:18,880
 i would say if i would have to move to france and live here permanently

1567
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,600
 for the whole duration of this process.

1568
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,679
 um, i would i would say that the most likely

1569
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,120
 i i expect that that i would be able to travel again later this year.

1570
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,719
 well, we're certainly rooting for you, pablo.

1571
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:35,439
 thank you very much.

1572
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:37,399
 thank you so much.

1573
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:43,679
 [music] so, it turns out that youtube is suppressing this show.

1574
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,359
 on one level, that's not surprising.

1575
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,158
 that's what they do.

1576
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:47,839
 but on another level, it's shocking.

1577
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:49,920
 with everything that's going on in the world right now,

1578
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:50,640
 all the change

1579
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:50,960
 taking

1580
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,158
 place in our economy

1581
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:53,359
 and our politics,

1582
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,320
 with the wars we're on the cusp of fighting right now,

1583
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,360
 google has decided you should have less information

1584
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,640
 rather than more.

1585
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:02,719
 and that is totally wrong.

1586
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,080
 it's immoral.

1587
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,679
 what can you do about it?

1588
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,040
 well, we could whine about it.

1589
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,080
 that's a waste of time.

1590
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,199
 we're not in charge of google.

1591
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,560
 or we could find a way around it.

1592
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:15,520
 a way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive.

1593
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,199
 the way to do that on youtube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel.

1594
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:24,480
 subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video.

1595
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,600
 that way, you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information.

1596
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,480
 so, we hope that you'll do
