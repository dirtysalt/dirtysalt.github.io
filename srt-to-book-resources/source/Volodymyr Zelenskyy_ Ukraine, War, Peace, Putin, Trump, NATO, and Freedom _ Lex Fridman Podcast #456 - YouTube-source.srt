1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:02,400
- I hope the Kyiv airport will open soon.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,533
Then it will... it will be easier to fly in.

3
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,032
- Yes, I think that the war will end,

4
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:13,400
and President Trump may be the first leader to travel here by airplane.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,633
I think it would be, it would be symbolic, by airplane.

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,333
- Again, January 25th, around that date, right?

7
00:00:19,366 --> 00:00:21,466
Flying in, meeting the Air Force One.

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,266
- Oh that would be cool.

9
00:00:23,333 --> 00:00:25,766
- There is a perception of corruption.

10
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:31,866
People like Donald Trump and Elon Musk really care, uh, about fighting corruption.

11
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:36,939
What can you say to them to gain their trust that the money is

12
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:40,733
going towards this fight for freedom, towards the war effort?

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:45,200
- In most of cases, we did not receive money, we received weapons.

14
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:49,300
And where we saw risks that something could be happening

15
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,766
with weapons, we cracked down hard on everyone.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,366
And believe me, this is not only about Ukraine.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,633
Everywhere along the supply chain, there are some or other

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,632
people and companies who want to make money, they try to make money on the war.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,666
We did not profit from the war.

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,933
If we caught someone, believe me, we cracked down hard on them.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,833
and... and we did that, and we will continue to do so.

22
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,566
Because to this day,

23
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:22,433
when someone says that Ukraine was selling weapons

24
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:26,566
— and, by the way, Russia was the one pushing this narrative —

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,533
we always responded: our soldiers

26
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:34,100
would kill such people with their own hands, without any trial.

27
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:37,700
Do you honestly think anyone could steal weapons by the

28
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:41,266
truckload when we ourselves don’t have enough on the front lines?

29
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,433
And yet, we have to provide proof to defend ourselves. Because when

30
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:50,333
there’s an abundance of such misinformation, distrust starts to grow.

31
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,900
And you're right, people listen to various

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,233
media outlets, see this, and lose faith in you.

33
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:02,200
In the end, you lose trust, and with it, you lose support.

34
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:08,733
Therefore, believe me, we are fighting more against disinformation than against

35
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,400
particular cases, although

36
00:02:11,425 --> 00:02:16,625
I still emphasize once again, at the everyday level such things

37
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:22,100
are still important. We catch these... these people, and we fight them.

38
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:26,738
As if Putin wants to sit down and talk,

39
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,100
but Ukraine does not. This is not true.

40
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,766
- I think that, yes, he is in fact ready to talk.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,866
- Did you talk to him? - On the phone or what?

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,400
- How do you normally talk to him?

43
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:42,366
- I don't know, normally by the sea, the same as with you.

44
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:45,759
He invites you to the sea with me, just the three of us.

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,966
- No, no, one of us may drown.

46
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,500
- Who? Are you good at swimming?

47
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,666
- Yes, I am a good swimmer.

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
- You're a good swimmer. Well...

49
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:55,666
If you think that the president of a country

50
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,479
is completely crazy,

51
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:00,866
it is really hard to come to an agreement with him.

52
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:03,733
You have to look at him as a

53
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,866
serious person who loves his country.

54
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,766
And loves the people in his country.

55
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:09,800
And he conducts, yes, destructive military actions.

56
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:12,800
- Who are you talking about now? Who loves his country?

57
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,033
- Putin. Do you think he doesn't love his country?

58
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:20,833
- No. What is his country? He happened to consider Ukraine his country.

59
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:22,433
What is his country?

60
00:03:22,433 --> 00:03:26,733
- When do you think there will be presidential elections in Ukraine?

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,666
The following is a conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine.

62
00:03:35,666 --> 00:03:41,263
It was an intense, raw, and heartfelt conversation, my goal for which was

63
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:46,400
to understand and to do all I can to push for peace.

64
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,000
Please allow me to say a few words, first about language, then about the President,

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,133
and finally about history.

66
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:58,300
Please skip ahead straight to our conversation if you like.

67
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:01,758
We spoke in a mix of languages,

68
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,900
continuously switching from Ukrainian to Russian to English.

69
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,200
So the interpreter was barely hanging on.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,800
It was indeed, in many ways, a wild ride of a conversation.

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,100
As the President said, the first of many.

72
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,600
Language, like many other things in a time of war, is a big deal.

73
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:26,625
We had a choice, speak in Russian, Ukrainian, or English.

74
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:31,333
The President does speak some English, but he's far from fluent in it.

75
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,666
And I, sadly, don't speak Ukrainian. Yet.

76
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,233
So Russian is the only common language we are both fluent in.

77
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:43,600
In case you don't know, the Russian language is one that the President speaks fluently

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,333
and was his primary language for most of his life.

79
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,933
It's the language I also speak fluently.

80
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:57,600
To the degree I speak any language fluently. As does a large fraction of the Ukrainian population.

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,666
So the most dynamic and powerful conversation

82
00:05:00,691 --> 00:05:04,133
between us would be in Russian, without an interpreter.

83
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:08,300
Who in this case, added about two to three second delay.

84
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,933
And frankly, translated partially and poorly.

85
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,233
For me at least.

86
00:05:13,233 --> 00:05:17,984
Taking away my ability to feel the humor, the wit, the brilliance, the pain,

87
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,200
the anger, the humanity of the person sitting before me.

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,266
That I could clearly feel when he was speaking fluently in the language I understand.

89
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,971
Russian.

90
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:32,666
But all that said, war changes everything.

91
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,334
The Ukrainian language has become a symbol of the

92
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:39,366
Ukrainian people's fight for freedom and independence.

93
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:43,400
So we had a difficult choice of three languages.

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,333
And faced with that choice, we said yes to all three.

95
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:52,733
To the consternation and dismay of the translators.

96
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:59,766
We make captions and voice over audio tracks available in English, Ukrainian, and

97
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:00,800
Russian.

98
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:04,933
So you can listen either to a version that is all one language.

99
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:09,233
Or to the original mixed language version with subtitles in your preferred language.

100
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,700
The default is English overdub.

101
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:17,966
On YouTube, you can switch between language audio tracks by clicking the settings gear icon.

102
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,400
Then clicking audio track.

103
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
And then selecting the language you prefer.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,300
English, Ukrainian, Russian.

105
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:35,033
To listen to the original mixed language version, please select the English UK audio track.

106
00:06:35,033 --> 00:06:42,100
Big thank you to Eleven Labs for their help with overdubbing using a mix of AI and humans.

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,100
We will continue to explore how to break down the barriers that language creates with

108
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,633
AI and otherwise.

109
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:52,433
This is a difficult but important endeavor.

110
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:57,933
Language, after all, is much more than a cold sequence of facts and logic statements.

111
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:04,500
There are words, when spoken in the right sequence and at the right time, that can

112
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,866
shake the world.

113
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:08,333
And turn the tides of history.

114
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,300
That can start and end wars.

115
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,500
Great leaders can find those words.

116
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,233
And great translators can help these words reverberate to the outskirts of a divided

117
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,533
civilization.

118
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:28,300
On another note, let me say that President Zelenskyy is a truly remarkable person and

119
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,900
a historic figure.

120
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:35,600
I say this as somebody who deeply understands the geopolitical complexity and history

121
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,633
of the region.

122
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:39,233
I am from this region.

123
00:07:39,233 --> 00:07:43,100
My parents were both born in Ukraine, Kyiv and Kharkiv.

124
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,733
Both my grandfathers, too.

125
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:52,633
I was born in Tajikistan and lived for a time there, then in Kyiv, then Moscow, then

126
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:54,300
United States.

127
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:02,233
And while I am now, for almost 30 years, and to the day I die, I am a proud American.

128
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:08,000
My family roots grow deep in the soil of nations that comprised the Soviet Union,

129
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:12,400
including Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Tajikistan.

130
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,666
I've gotten to know and have spoken for hours with members of the President's team

131
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:17,933
and people close to him.

132
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:24,333
I spoke to hundreds of Ukrainians since 2022, including soldiers, civilians,

133
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,200
politicians, artists, religious leaders,

134
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,400
journalists, economists, historians, and technologists.

135
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,633
I've listened to hundreds of hours of programs that both support and criticize the

136
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:39,866
President in Ukraine, in Russia, in the United States.

137
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:46,100
I've read countless books about this war and the long arc of history that led up to it.

138
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,066
If forced to recommend two, at this moment, I would say the Russo-Ukrainian War by

139
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:53,033
Serhii Plokhy

140
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:59,000
and The Showman by Simon Schuster, which is a good personal behind-the-scenes

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,133
biography of the President focused on 2022. But there are many, many more.

142
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:11,200
This is why I can comfortably say that he is a truly singular and remarkable human

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,500
being.

144
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,400
It was an honor and pleasure to talk with him on and off the mic.

145
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:24,966
Now, it is true that I plan to travel to Moscow and to speak with President Vladimir Putin.

146
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,000
And I hope to be back in Kyiv as well.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,933
As President Zelenskyy said, this was our first of many more meetings.

148
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:37,133
In all these cases, I seek to do my small part in pushing for peace.

149
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:43,300
And in doing all this, I'm deeply grateful for the trust people have given me on all sides.

150
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,666
For the people attacking me, sometimes lying about me.

151
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:53,933
For the critics in the stands, chanting the latest slogans of the mass hysteria

152
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:56,300
machine like sheep in Animal Farm.

153
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,133
I love you too.

154
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:05,400
And I assure you that drawing lines between good and evil on a world map is much

155
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,033
easier than seeing that line

156
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:12,900
between good and evil in every human being, including you and me.

157
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,333
This is what I try to do.

158
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm simply a human being who seeks to find and surface the humanity in others.

159
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:27,187
And, as I've said, no amount of money, fame, power, access

160
00:10:27,229 --> 00:10:30,091
can buy my opinion or my integrity.

161
00:10:31,341 --> 00:10:36,175
Now, finally, please allow me to briefly overview some history

162
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,153
to give background for several topics that

163
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:40,704
President Zelenskyy references in this conversation.

164
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:43,269
I recommend my conversation with Serhii Plokhy

165
00:10:43,293 --> 00:10:45,833
and many others about the history of the region.

166
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:51,633
But here, let me start with 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence

167
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,400
and the Soviet Union collapsed.

168
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,308
From this point on, Russia-Ukraine relations were defined in large part

169
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:04,429
by whether Ukraine aligned more with Russia or with the West, meaning Europe,

170
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,600
United States, NATO, and so on.

171
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,466
In 2004, with the Orange Revolution, a pro-Western candidate, Viktor Yushchenko,

172
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:13,900
became president.

173
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,633
In 2010, it went the other way.

174
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:21,300
A pro-Russia candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, became president.

175
00:11:21,775 --> 00:11:27,775
The internal tensions grew, and in 2013, Euromaidan protests broke out over Yanukovych's

176
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,300
decision to suspend talks with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.

177
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,033
This set forward a chain of important events in 2014.

178
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:42,200
On the politics front, Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, leading to the

179
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,666
election of a pro-Western president.

180
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:51,600
Also, in 2014, on the war front, Russia annexed Crimea and war broke out in the Donbas

181
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
region of eastern Ukraine,

182
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:59,833
which eventually killed over 14,000 people and continued all the way to 2022,

183
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:08,866
when, on February 24, 2022, Russian forces initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

184
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:12,700
This is when the world started to really pay attention.

185
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,433
Now, some history of peace talks.

186
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:21,600
Volodymyr Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019, and he discusses, in this conversation,

187
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,933
the ceasefire agreements he made with Vladimir Putin in 2019,

188
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,666
which was one of many attempts at peace,

189
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:32,975
from the two Minsk agreements in 2014 and 15,

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,300
to a series of ceasefire agreements in 2018, 19, and 20,

191
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,333
all of which failed, in part or in whole.

192
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:47,433
All this shows just how difficult ceasefire and peace negotiations are,

193
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,133
but they are not impossible.

194
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:54,900
It is always worth trying, over and over again, to find the path to peace.

195
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,881
I believe that Presidents Zelenskyy, Putin, and Trump

196
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:02,500
should meet soon after January 20th this year,

197
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,033
and give everything they got to negotiate a ceasefire and security guarantees

198
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:11,000
that pave the way for a long-lasting peace.

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,858
We discussed several ideas for this in this conversation.

200
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,991
As I said, this was one of my main goals here, to push for peace.

201
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,400
This trip to Kyiv and this conversation was a truly special moment for me in my life.

202
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,466
It is one I will never forget.

203
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:32,760
So to reflect, I say a few more words

204
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:35,739
and answer some questions at the very end, if you'd like to listen.

205
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:42,133
But here, let me say thank you to everyone for your support over the years.

206
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:44,499
It means the world.

207
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:49,500
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast, and now, dear friends,

208
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,516
here's the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

209
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:58,100
- If we can explain why the Ukrainian language is very important,

210
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:01,333
our conversation will be most effective and impactful if we speak in Russian.

211
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:03,158
- I speak Russian perfectly, of course,

212
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,366
and I understand everything you are talking about.

213
00:14:05,766 --> 00:14:09,100
However, I can't respond in Russian the entire interview.

214
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,866
It's because... This is how it is today.

215
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:17,000
I am not making anything up, you can see it all for yourself, you can feel and hear it.

216
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:20,566
Today, there were 73 missile attacks against us,

217
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,466
and people were killed. There were over 100 drones today.

218
00:14:24,766 --> 00:14:26,633
And this is a daily occurrence.

219
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,366
The people who attack us

220
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,533
they speak Russian.

221
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,333
They attack people who were only recently told that

222
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:38,366
this was actually in defense of Russian speaking people.

223
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:42,666
And this is why I respect neither the leader

224
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,266
or director of today's Russia, nor the people. I just...

225
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,666
That's it.

226
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:52,133
- And I... I don't think that you can just...

227
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,866
can just pretend that nothing is happening and give Putin a pass once again

228
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,300
for saying that we are one people, that we speak one language, etc.

229
00:15:03,433 --> 00:15:06,333
They speak the language of weapons, that is a fact.

230
00:15:06,433 --> 00:15:10,433
And we are peaceful people... peaceful people who...

231
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:15,933
want to protect themselves. And defend their freedom and their human choice.

232
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,633
You know, at the beginning of the war

233
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,600
I addressed Russians in Russian.

234
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,433
Zero effect.

235
00:15:30,633 --> 00:15:32,066
They're mute.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,900
They....they do not listen, they did not listen.

237
00:15:36,466 --> 00:15:39,733
Some are afraid, some have other issues, they have different reasons.

238
00:15:39,766 --> 00:15:41,500
It's like when a person is drowning...

239
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:44,366
drowning and people walk by because they can't hear them.

240
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:48,133
And someone walks on by crying, afraid to save them.

241
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,000
It doesn't change anything for the one drowning.

242
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,333
They need someone to help them.

243
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,966
This is why I honestly despise these people, as they are deaf.

244
00:15:57,433 --> 00:16:01,000
They…they began the occupation in the supposed

245
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:04,566
defense of the Russian language. And that's why...

246
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:10,300
With all due respect, I would like to give an interview in Ukrainian. This is very...

247
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:12,433
This is very important to me.

248
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:16,366
If there are some points

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,300
that you want me to explain in Russian, I can certainly do that.

250
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:27,533
I can certainly occasionally speak Russian... But in general, in general no.

251
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,700
I'm not sure that you'll understand me completely, despite your Ukrainian roots.

252
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:37,166
You are a citizen of the United States, right?

253
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:39,833
- Yes.

254
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:46,466
- That's why I'm surprised that you don't understand...

255
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,200
Well, it was a long time ago. I understand that it was a long time ago.

256
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:57,666
Moreover, a lot has changed, a lot has changed.

257
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:01,300
- If I may, please allow me to say this in Russian.

258
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,633
Yes, many things have changed.

259
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:09,965
But I have hope. I hope that today many Russians will hear this,

260
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,700
that Vladimir Putin will hear this.

261
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:15,633
That the American President Donald Trump and the American people will hear this.

262
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:20,965
That everyone will hear this. And yes, Ukrainian language is important symbolically.

263
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,233
But what is also important is that we understand each other well.

264
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,965
- For Donald Trump? Is it important for Donald... - Yeah

265
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:30,939
- Trump whether I speak Russian or not? -  Yes, yes. Because, unfortunately,

266
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:34,433
and it hurts to admit, but I cannot speak or understand Ukrainian yet.

267
00:17:34,433 --> 00:17:38,233
So your... your wit, dynamism, and your humanity

268
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,500
will not come through as well and as quickly.

269
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,800
Remember, I need to wait for two to three seconds to hear it.

270
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:50,033
You have a great sense of humor, great stories. With an interpreter translating,

271
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:53,433
I simply won't see this, but I understand that it's painful.

272
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,433
Another reason is that I hoped we could show...that even though

273
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:03,466
it is sometimes said that Russian is banned in Ukraine...

274
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,366
- This is not true. I'm speaking Russian now, right?

275
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,000
We have people who speak Russian. This is not true, really, it's not.

276
00:18:10,566 --> 00:18:16,000
It's really not true. We disrespect Russian now because of Russians.

277
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:20,100
That's all. When they were saving Russian-speakers, they

278
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,400
killed Russian-speakers, many people who actually...

279
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:26,500
Many of whom are in the east, right?

280
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,233
In the East, they lived in the East. They destroyed

281
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:33,500
their houses, destroyed their lives.

282
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:36,433
It's not a rhetorical thing, it's not all talk and "blah, blah, blah."

283
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:40,233
I don't have time for "blah, blah, blah." Yeah, so it's a very...

284
00:18:40,366 --> 00:18:43,133
a very, very important and sensitive moment.

285
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,100
The message is that we are not one nation. We are not..

286
00:18:47,566 --> 00:18:51,066
you know, the same country. We're different countries.

287
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,100
Yes, different countries.

288
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:58,766
And I think what is most important is what we're talking about.

289
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,266
Not how we're speaking about it. This is what I think.

290
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:08,133
You're a smart guy, so you have a lot of experience in dialogue of this kind.

291
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,300
That's why I think you will, you will understand me.

292
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,233
Yeah I, anyway, I think it is far better

293
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:21,266
for Donald Trump to hear my English, not my Russian.

294
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,266
- Your English is much better than my Ukrainian.

295
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,840
You're getting better and better every day.

296
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:30,677
- That's true. I'm a very honest guy, that's why I will be very honest with you.

297
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:31,109
- Ok.

298
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:35,600
- Your Ukrainian is not very good, but we will, but we will work on it.

299
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:38,400
- Yes. I have many flaws and that's one of them.

300
00:19:38,508 --> 00:19:41,141
- Sometimes, I can speak English. Sometimes, as

301
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,000
I understand, we can be very flexible. Right?

302
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:47,600
- Very flexible. Spanish, Swahili.

303
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:48,608
- Yeah, you see?

304
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,200
- Yeah. Javier Milei needs to understand this, so...

305
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:55,100
- By the way, Javier understood me without any words.

306
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,333
- The language of love, maybe.

307
00:19:57,358 --> 00:19:58,825
- Of respect  - Respect

308
00:19:58,849 --> 00:19:59,837
- I respect him - Yeah

309
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:02,666
- I had a very good conversation with him. Really brilliant.

310
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,337
- May I sometimes speak Russian and sometimes English?

311
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,533
- Yeah, yes, you can use any language you like.

312
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:11,700
And I think that's a very good rule for this first meeting between us,

313
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,600
as you said, maybe we will meet in the future, for the second time.

314
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,200
- Second, and third, and fourth...

315
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:20,566
- Yeah, this is... this is good. You can ask questions in the language

316
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
you'd like and I will answer in the language I can.

317
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:27,066
- Well, you said you wanted to meet by the sea at some point.

318
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:30,100
So, for our next meeting. Let's meet by the sea.

319
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:32,933
- With pleasure. Next time, It would be much better

320
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:36,966
to meet by our Ukrainian Black or Azov Sea.

321
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,933
- You know, I have been to a lot of...

322
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,000
I have traveled to many cities in Ukraine, but I have never been to Odessa.

323
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,141
And everyone tells me that and I don't know why.

324
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,033
- You have to.

325
00:20:47,566 --> 00:20:50,566
- Can you explain to me why everyone loves Odessa so much?

326
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:52,566
What's there?

327
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,775
You know... What's in Odessa?

328
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,866
That's how they say it.

329
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,866
What's there? In Odessa, we've got it all!

330
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,700
- Okay.

331
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:05,533
- Odessa, I love Odessa because of its particular temperament.

332
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,700
People have their own... their own accent and it's so...

333
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,700
There are many nationalities, you know, there are a lot of...

334
00:21:12,766 --> 00:21:16,800
lot of stories. Authentic Odessa cuisine.

335
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:20,766
By the way, you know, the cuisine is very different from others...

336
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,566
The dishes are not like any other, dishes and everything is very tasty.

337
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,400
Also, there are beautiful people.

338
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,533
And today, you know...

339
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:38,066
you understand people very well, especially after... after the attacks on Odessa.

340
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:44,000
You understand what the people are like, just how Odessites are very Ukrainian.

341
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:46,533
And that's... that's very cool.

342
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:49,600
I love Odessa. I go there several times a year.

343
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:55,133
I go there several times a year now because... well,

344
00:21:55,466 --> 00:21:58,866
now because of strengthening of air defense systems, because of

345
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,833
this grain corridor, etc. I go there more often.

346
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,166
They have the sun there.

347
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,633
They have the sea.

348
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,666
It's Ukraine and it's very cool there.

349
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,533
- Well, when you come and visit me in Texas as a guest for the third time...

350
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:18,200
- With pleasure. - Let's do this.

351
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:21,174
How about you, my friend Joe Rogan,

352
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,000
and I will go get some Texas barbecue together.

353
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,333
- Who will pay?

354
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:29,147
- That's a good question. - Putin, Putin...

355
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:31,372
for everything, he has to pay.

356
00:22:31,397 --> 00:22:33,000
- Well, well, yes, we'll invite him too.

357
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,466
- No, no, no. - Okay.

358
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,600
- Without him. - Okay, I get it. Understood.

359
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:46,633
- But, if the Rome Statute will be accepted by your government before this moment...

360
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,866
- By the way, I don't know if you know this, but

361
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,000
Joe has a great comedy club in Austin.

362
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:54,266
- Joe Rogan? - Joe Rogan, yes.

363
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:58,566
And I think that as a person who respects comedy and stand-up

364
00:22:58,566 --> 00:23:00,933
comedy, it would be interesting for you to have a look at it.

365
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:05,691
- No, no, he is... I know him and I saw a lot of different videos.

366
00:23:05,866 --> 00:23:09,566
He's a... He's a very talented person, so it would be a

367
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,600
pleasure. If you invite me and I'm able to do it.

368
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:15,533
I'm... I'm a little bit busy.

369
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:16,966
- Yeah. - But...

370
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,900
if I'll be... if I'll be in the United States,

371
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,100
I hope that I will have a conversation and a meeting with President Trump.

372
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,100
And of course, during my visit if I'll have the

373
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:29,300
time, it would be a pleasure, if you'll invite me.

374
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,133
With pleasure.

375
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,033
- You know what?

376
00:23:31,866 --> 00:23:32,900
I will pay.

377
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,033
- Good.

378
00:23:34,066 --> 00:23:37,433
- Yeah. You know, I had to think about it, but you are the president.

379
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:39,000
- Yes, with you, with pleasure.

380
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,666
- When the war is over, please come.

381
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:42,866
- Thanks so much. - And when you're less busy.

382
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,000
- Thanks so much.

383
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,433
- If we can go back many years, to the World War two.

384
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,100
Tell me the story of your grandfather who fought in the second World War.

385
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:57,366
- My grandfather, he... he graduated from the military...

386
00:23:58,166 --> 00:24:03,500
military academy and from the very beginning of the war he went to fight.

387
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,866
He was in the infantry, and he fought through the entire war. He had many wounds.

388
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:13,966
As they used to say back then, "His chest is covered

389
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,300
in medals." And it’s true - he had more than 30.

390
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,666
Yes more than 30. He was the kind of man...

391
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,266
He was such...

392
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:32,366
He was such a serious man. I loved him very much. And we had a very close relationship.

393
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:41,066
He didn't like to tell details about the war. He never... he never boasted.

394
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:48,033
Although I asked him as a boy would, "How many fascists did you kill?"

395
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,533
He never talked about it.

396
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,166
He believed that the war was a great...

397
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:59,200
a great tragedy. A tragedy for everyone.

398
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,333
And...

399
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,900
Ukraine was occupied, and it was a tragedy for Ukraine,

400
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:09,500
a tragedy for Europe, and a tragedy for the Jewish people.

401
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,933
His own brothers, his entire family, were executed.

402
00:25:16,566 --> 00:25:21,133
They were tortured by fascists,

403
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:29,600
who had occupied Ukraine and their village. His father was the head of the village.

404
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:36,100
And he was killed - they were shot. It was a mass...

405
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:41,166
A mass grave, right? Yes, it was a communal burial.

406
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:46,400
Some of them were killed outright and others were... They were buried alive.

407
00:25:47,266 --> 00:25:53,366
His four brothers, they all went to war. As soon as the war began, they were all there.

408
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:57,166
He was the only one, who had a military

409
00:25:57,166 --> 00:26:00,733
education. And they all... died in the war.

410
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:08,100
He was the only one who came back. He had nobody, he came back and

411
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:15,066
he found... found my grandmother, his future wife.

412
00:26:15,166 --> 00:26:18,266
And she was, she managed... What was it called then?

413
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,133
I don't know, they don't have them anymore. It was

414
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:25,166
a childcare facility, an orphanage, so to speak.

415
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,100
A place, where orphans lived.

416
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:34,300
Children who... who don't have... parents, children of war.

417
00:26:34,866 --> 00:26:37,666
And she managed this childcare facility.

418
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:40,966
With "difficult" children, as they used to call them,

419
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,133
"difficult" children, who went through the war.

420
00:26:44,533 --> 00:26:47,700
Who saw their parents killed. And this is how they met,

421
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,700
because these "difficult" children, they, well, sometimes

422
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,966
behaved differently, they could steal something, do something bad.

423
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,800
There were many, many children in the orphanage.

424
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:12,533
Yes. That's how she met my grandfather. And I loved him very much.

425
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:16,500
And I think that my grandfather,

426
00:27:17,566 --> 00:27:20,300
frankly, would never have believed that

427
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:22,433
this war is possible.

428
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,133
He would never have believed it.

429
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:28,600
Because he worked in the police after the war, he was a colonel,

430
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,000
he worked in a criminal investigation all his life.

431
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:41,166
So, he fought with bandits all his life.

432
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,066
After the Second World War. But also, I believe, he

433
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,333
fought for justice all his life. And we all lived in one apartment,

434
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,700
and even after his death I lived

435
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:59,000
with both of my grandmothers and my parents.

436
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:04,866
Two grandmothers, who both lost their husbands. Both of them died.

437
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,300
Well, it was an ordinary family.

438
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,366
An ordinary family that lived like everyone lived back then,

439
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,566
in the Soviet union and even after the Soviets, in the nineties.

440
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,100
We lived in one apartment, all together.

441
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,200
What else is there to say?

442
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:29,300
But I think the most important thing was values, respect.

443
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:33,833
They gave me an education—my parents gave me an education.

444
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:36,200
No one left me money or apartments.

445
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:39,633
So, I didn’t inherit anything material.

446
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:43,400
But I believe that our real inheritance is here

447
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:47,566
in our minds and in our hearts. I believe that.

448
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,975
- It's a one second delay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah...

449
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:59,893
- So, if I... I'm sorry, if you... - It's fine...

450
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:03,652
- ...tell a joke, I will laugh about 1, 2 or 3 seconds later.

451
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,000
There's a delay. So...

452
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,066
An ordinary family, but not an ordinary time, World War two.

453
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:17,133
World War two. Speaking of mass graves, I was at Babyn Yar yesterday.

454
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:19,466
A large part of my family died there.

455
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,266
In moments like this, such a place serves as a stark reminder

456
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,733
of the profound historical gravity of the second World War.

457
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,333
I remember...

458
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:33,266
I remember this song from my youth: "On June 22nd,

459
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,833
at 4 o'clock, Kyiv was bombed and the war began."

460
00:29:38,966 --> 00:29:42,200
I always wondered how it would feel to live in a moment when...

461
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,833
when everything changed. The path of humanity

462
00:29:46,066 --> 00:29:48,966
completely shifts—in a single moment, just like that.

463
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:55,400
What do you think... what do you think about that moment in 1941?

464
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:57,966
Now, after the 2022 invasion,

465
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,833
how do you perceive the Second World War after you have witnessed all of it?

466
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:04,100
- Well...

467
00:30:05,666 --> 00:30:10,300
Well, firstly, the war actually started earlier.

468
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:15,466
It started here, in Ukraine. Kyiv was bombed, as you quoted.

469
00:30:16,266 --> 00:30:20,866
But the war had already begun before that. And I think

470
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:28,033
I perceived it as a start of the full-scale invasion.

471
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,100
Well...

472
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,066
I think

473
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:38,966
it's hard... it's hard to understand why nobody wants to listen,

474
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:43,633
look at and analyze history.

475
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:51,800
War, the rise of fascism and Nazism, the emergence

476
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,366
of Hitler, Goebbels, and their entire team—at the time,

477
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:05,133
this wasn’t just about one party or even one country. It was, essentially, a wave.

478
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,900
A wave of hatred, a wave of

479
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:15,666
"one race above the rest."

480
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:21,733
They were, in fact, constructing and ultimately implemented

481
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:25,700
a theory around this idea, later seizing Europe.

482
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:31,733
They created a theory of one nation, one race, one world.

483
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:32,966
Their world.

484
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,866
Of course, this idea is absolutely senseless,

485
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:41,966
but it has become radicalized over the years and even gained support.

486
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,300
A vision of "one world." And, in principle, the so-called Russian World,

487
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:53,700
the ideology Putin promotes and imposes—it wasn’t originally like that.

488
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:56,933
He was a different person back then, or maybe he was

489
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:59,966
always like this, but his rhetoric was different.

490
00:32:00,066 --> 00:32:05,366
At the beginning, remember, he talked about the EU, and even about Russia’s future

491
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,800
being tied to NATO—there were even talks of joining the European Union, NATO.

492
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,566
He spoke about shared values with the West. That’s how it all sounded back then.

493
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,900
And we must also look at Hitler, who was seriously...

494
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,766
Before the radical idea of taking over the whole world, he actually made...

495
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,166
certain steps, and everyone believed he was helping the economy.

496
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,233
And, to be fair, he did take some steps in that direction.

497
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,866
But he was a terrifying person.

498
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,300
None of those actions justify him, nor do they excuse his actions.

499
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,966
And that’s why we cannot look at the second World War as if it started in 1939.

500
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:57,666
It didn’t begin in 1941 either. We need to draw conclusions. When did it start?

501
00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:59,600
With the weaknesses of the world.

502
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:05,300
The division of European states. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

503
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,833
All of this happened before 1941.

504
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:12,666
People who were more informed, those who dug deeper—whether they were

505
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:19,066
politicians or not, whether they were from different walks of life,

506
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:26,000
including business, which was different back then—were speaking about all of this.

507
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,033
Hitler won't stop. There'll be a world war.

508
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,833
Hitler will destroy nations. Nations.

509
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:40,033
And that's what happened. Someone looked the other way.

510
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:45,000
What I told you about. Europe was sinking then. I gave you an example of it.

511
00:33:45,366 --> 00:33:48,166
But the whole world looked the other way.

512
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,933
And didn't pay attention. And said, "No, we can negotiate with him."

513
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,200
"I'm telling you he is ok. We can negotiate with him.

514
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,466
He's just more right-leaning." Or, it does not

515
00:33:57,466 --> 00:34:00,866
matter what they said. "He's just He's just pro,

516
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:03,666
very pro nationalist."

517
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:10,733
This is all nonsense, and this is not the first time.

518
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,132
And Hitler isn't the first such case in history.

519
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,733
We're dealing with a person who is allowed to stick

520
00:34:22,065 --> 00:34:23,466
to this

521
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:26,000
desire to destroy.

522
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:30,166
He was consumed by it and enjoying it.

523
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,199
And what happened to Hitler? Now, what about Putin?

524
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:38,866
This invasion was also at four in the morning... around four in the morning.

525
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:42,766
There were missile strikes on Ukraine. This is the same.

526
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,166
I believe that intentions are also the same,

527
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,933
but more on that later. By the way, you tell me

528
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:52,933
If this is too long, you can stop me.

529
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:55,000
- Never long enough. It's beautiful.

530
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,033
- Okay, so... It happened here around four in the morning. I...

531
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,233
Before this, I must honestly say...

532
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,700
Everyone said something, predicted something, etc., but I asked

533
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,933
only for one thing, primarily from the United States: if you

534
00:35:14,966 --> 00:35:18,433
are sure, if you have the evidence, if you talk to him, and he

535
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:22,466
tells you that there'll be an invasion, if all this scares you.

536
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,166
I only asked for two things - send us weapons, or better yet,

537
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,833
strengthen us with preventive measures so there would be no war.

538
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:40,033
It wasn't the weapons that I was asking for, I asked for sanctions.

539
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:45,366
Intimidate him, please don't say that if he comes, if he crosses borders,

540
00:35:45,733 --> 00:35:48,533
if he kills, we're imposing sanctions.

541
00:35:48,566 --> 00:35:53,200
Well, this is complete bullshit. Sorry, but really.

542
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,766
- Oh, I understand this! - Oh, wonderful! Yes.

543
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,515
- I understood one word. - Yeah...

544
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,833
- So they did not help...

545
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:08,133
- I believe that no, and this is a fact. We didn't receive help.

546
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:12,800
If we assume that words are help, well, then yes we

547
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:18,566
received a lot of it, because there were plenty of words.

548
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,266
Even more than plenty. Yes?

549
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:24,833
At four in the morning there were strikes.

550
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:31,633
Morally, is it possible to prepare for war? No.

551
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:34,066
It doesn't happen like you read in books,

552
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,433
see in movies, and so on. What happens to you...

553
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:40,966
I was just looking at my wife and children.

554
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,166
My children were asleep, but my wife was awake.

555
00:36:44,366 --> 00:36:45,566
There were strikes.

556
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,933
Missile strikes, we heard them.

557
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:54,033
To you, as a living person...

558
00:36:55,866 --> 00:37:00,133
how can this be? You just can't fully believe this.

559
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:06,666
You just don't understand, why now, given everything that

560
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:13,500
happen in World War 2... when... when millions of people died.

561
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,866
None of it mattered. Still, at four...

562
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:22,800
at four in the morning. Around four, 3:40, 3:45, remember?

563
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,166
Around this time, yes, there were missile strikes.

564
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:28,333
And later, by the way,

565
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:30,833
a few

566
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:34,166
days after, after the first days of the war,

567
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,533
I spoke with Lukashenko on the phone.

568
00:37:41,533 --> 00:37:42,933
And he apologized.

569
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:47,566
And he said that it was not me; missiles were launched

570
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,900
from my territory, and Putin was the one launching them.

571
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,500
These are his words. I have witnesses.

572
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,666
"And I apologize," he said. "But believe me,"

573
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:03,233
that's what he told me, "Volodya, this is not me."

574
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,966
“I am not in charge,” he told me, “I am not in charge, these are just missiles,

575
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,066
this is Putin." I told him, "Don't do that." "This was done without me."

576
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:17,133
"That's it, he just..." On the phone, I remember

577
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:20,333
this conversation. I told him that I believed...

578
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:25,166
I told him, "You are a murderer too, I'm just saying."

579
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:31,366
And he told me, "You must understand, you can't fight the Russians."

580
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,200
I told him that we never fought them.

581
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,400
I said, "It's war, the missiles came from your

582
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:39,866
land, from Belarus, how did you allow this?"

583
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:43,766
Then he replied, "All right, retaliate then."

584
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:48,266
I still remember him telling me, "Hit the

585
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,766
refinery, you know how much I care about it."

586
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,000
Mozyr Oil Refinery is that it? Can't recall. Mozyr Oil Refinery.

587
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,033
I told him, "What are you on about, what retaliation?"

588
00:39:00,233 --> 00:39:01,400
- "Forgive me, Volodya."

589
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,333
- Yes, yes. - Yes.

590
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,966
This... this was at 5 in the morning?

591
00:39:05,966 --> 00:39:09,066
- No, no, no. This was during the first or maybe the second day.

592
00:39:09,122 --> 00:39:10,741
Second or third day of the war, yes.

593
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:11,533
- Oh, I see

594
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:20,200
- Well, after that I went back home. I was home with my children, with my wife.

595
00:39:20,866 --> 00:39:24,066
I just went to my wife very quickly that night, at four o'clock,

596
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,900
yes, and just told her: "Get the children, get ready.

597
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:32,400
You'll probably need to go to my office very soon", and I left. That's it.

598
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:35,000
At this moment,

599
00:39:35,966 --> 00:39:41,266
you're no longer a father. What happened to me,

600
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:44,733
unfortunately, because I believe that this is...

601
00:39:45,766 --> 00:39:48,900
and not only do I believe, I understand, especially

602
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,933
now, that all of this is the most important thing.

603
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:55,300
Because your country is your family.

604
00:39:56,866 --> 00:40:00,566
The strength is in your family, and this is the most important thing.

605
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,933
And I'm the president, and therefore I had to stop being a father in my own family.

606
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:09,566
And my wife had to do everything, she had to do

607
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,933
everything regarding children, regarding safety.

608
00:40:13,966 --> 00:40:17,333
And... and I had to deal with the state because I'm the

609
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:23,400
president. And this is my duty. And I, by the way, am...

610
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:28,733
am taking this very seriously. I went to the office and here we are now.

611
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,433
You're very welcome.

612
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,166
- Well, at that moment on February 24th, 2022,

613
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,033
everything changed again, just like in June 1941.

614
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:43,133
Everything changed. History took a turn.

615
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,500
The history of humanity took a turn. And for you, too.

616
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,800
You were the president.

617
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:55,166
You were... you were talking about fighting corruption, about the country's freedom,

618
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:57,900
about interesting and innovative reforms.

619
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:03,366
But that morning, of February 22nd, everything changed.

620
00:41:04,066 --> 00:41:07,333
Could you tell me about that morning, the details of your actions,

621
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:13,866
when you had to quickly make difficult decisions?

622
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:19,400
What was the process for you, how did you make these decisions? Did you discuss them

623
00:41:19,733 --> 00:41:24,333
with people you trust to understand how to respond to this invasion

624
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:30,900
in every technical, political and military aspect.

625
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,033
What was the process for you, how did you make the decision?

626
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,333
- According to our legislation, in principle, I'm the Supreme Commander

627
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:45,366
of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, so I had to give corresponding orders.

628
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:49,166
Yes, I have a military office, and then later there was

629
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:51,866
a military headquarters where all key people gathered.

630
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,866
This is not only about the military, it's about energy, etc., all key things.

631
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:59,233
But at that moment I made the decisions.

632
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:07,400
Quickly and without a doubt. And I cannot say that I am just that kind of person.

633
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:13,066
I'm just a living person who believed that if help is needed right now,

634
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:20,166
to help evacuate people, help with children... Several cities were blocked.

635
00:42:20,433 --> 00:42:26,633
I was only thinking about how to deliver food there within a day.

636
00:42:27,033 --> 00:42:30,966
We did a lot of things, although we understood that

637
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:35,266
that they, in fact, occupied a part of our state.

638
00:42:35,266 --> 00:42:38,366
that they, in fact, occupied a part of our state.

639
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,533
And...

640
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,266
We distributed weapons to people.

641
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:48,033
That's how it was.

642
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,933
Trucks came and simply distributed weapons

643
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:55,966
to people so that they could defend the capital.

644
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,200
To ordinary people. Just on the street, to ordinary people who...

645
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:07,533
who understood that if the Russians enter the city, then we would have the same

646
00:43:07,566 --> 00:43:11,333
thing that's happening in other cities, per the information we received.

647
00:43:13,166 --> 00:43:16,666
Thanks to digitalization, by the way. We had a very

648
00:43:16,666 --> 00:43:20,800
good digitalization before this. And we preserved a lot.

649
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:28,100
And even when they were surrounding certain cities, a lot of things still worked.

650
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:31,466
The banking system, the Internet, we had

651
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:34,566
television. And thanks to this, I made several

652
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:40,433
decisions to ensure that people are united and have all the information.

653
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,233
Russia is very good,

654
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:47,200
at spreading large-scale disinformation.

655
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,966
Fortunately, I have two decades

656
00:43:50,966 --> 00:43:57,400
of experience managing a production studio,

657
00:43:57,933 --> 00:44:01,933
TV channels, and large media resources.

658
00:44:01,966 --> 00:44:07,866
I understood that we needed to build an information network very quickly.

659
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:11,633
Thanks to this, I began to address the people constantly.

660
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:14,900
This happened several times, three to five times a day.

661
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,266
In fact, I became

662
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:21,866
that information source

663
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:27,433
for people who were in cities that were cut off from other information.

664
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:31,966
And it was very important for me to keep all things

665
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,766
digital - to keep the Internet, to stay in touch

666
00:44:36,133 --> 00:44:40,633
with everyone, with all the people. Initially, that's the contact we had.

667
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:46,033
And then we also built a media platform, so...

668
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:50,533
where we had all the news agencies, agencies of Ukraine.

669
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,500
And this network was called "Marathon".

670
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:57,100
And it was also very important for the people to

671
00:44:57,133 --> 00:45:01,466
trust us. And people had to receive information. Why?

672
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:02,966
There were waves.

673
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:09,266
There were waves of Russian on the first day, who said, "He ran away."

674
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:15,066
I had to go out into the street. I left the office and went outside.

675
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,200
I had to do this, because I was showing that this was no green screen.

676
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:21,566
You know, to show that it was the street,

677
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,700
not some digital... some digital manipualtion.

678
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,500
I mean, I did these things. Then I touched

679
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:30,566
various objects. Now people might think that

680
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,800
these are small things, but I was actually showing

681
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:39,166
that I was in a real place. All of this had an impact.

682
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:41,400
I was absolutely sure of my actions.

683
00:45:42,566 --> 00:45:45,766
And these contacts, several contacts. And then

684
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,633
I spoke to the Russians, I addressed Russians.

685
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:52,266
I really did, and then only after that I gathered...

686
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,333
It was the first day when I invited all of the journalists here, wasn't it?

687
00:45:57,533 --> 00:46:00,700
That was on the first day, I think. Well, not

688
00:46:00,733 --> 00:46:04,333
here here, to the press center in this building.

689
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:12,000
I talked to journalists, I asked them not to leave, because we needed weapons.

690
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:18,333
At that moment, they were handing out rifles to people. And for me journalists

691
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:22,000
and media platforms were essential voices.

692
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,166
There were … There were various journalists from different countries here...

693
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,566
And....they were essentially stuck.

694
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:34,133
And I asked them for contacts, those who had access to...

695
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,800
to Russians, Belorussians, Kazakhs who understood everything.

696
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,200
The same information. And I....I spoke to them..

697
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,966
And I spoke to them and spoke in Russian. I told them,

698
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:50,200
"You must stop Putin." This is terrible.

699
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:52,800
This is horror. This is war. You must stop him.

700
00:46:52,833 --> 00:46:56,600
And if you stand up now, if you speak out and if you go out into the streets...

701
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:59,800
This was very important. I spoke to them in

702
00:46:59,833 --> 00:47:02,566
Russian, to show them that there was no problem.

703
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:07,000
And that all of these pretexts were, were made up.

704
00:47:08,266 --> 00:47:12,333
This is why it's so painful to talk about the Russian language too because,

705
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:16,933
look, if a person does not want to listen, they will not listen

706
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:19,266
no matter what language we speak.

707
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,366
- I disagree with you here. I think and hope

708
00:47:23,566 --> 00:47:26,266
that many people in Russia will hear us today.

709
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:29,866
- They blocked YouTube recently.

710
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:32,600
Are you aware of this? In their country.

711
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:35,633
-  I know. And I simply guarantee that this

712
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,933
conversation will travel fast on the internet.

713
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,766
Everyone will hear you. They will hear you,

714
00:47:41,266 --> 00:47:43,533
including the President of Russia will hear you.

715
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,966
This is why I have hope.

716
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:52,366
- He is actually deaf, even if he speaks to you, he is deaf by his very nature.

717
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:59,133
Do you understand the difference? You know, for instance when you talk to Musk

718
00:48:00,466 --> 00:48:02,333
you're talking to

719
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,233
an innovator, a scientist, about rockets,

720
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:13,366
you talk about how to save on costs, and how they land...

721
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:16,600
And on the other hand, Putin doesn't

722
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,300
launch rockets to save money, but to kill people.

723
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:23,733
Do you think you can talk to Putin about technology?

724
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,966
Your guys were interviewing him and he told them about...

725
00:48:29,266 --> 00:48:33,266
about tribal history. Do you understand?

726
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,966
Imagine a Russian man in his country listening to him...

727
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,200
You know what Musk is about?

728
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,233
Technology, Mars, artificial intelligence.

729
00:48:42,266 --> 00:48:46,833
And this guy, Putin, is standing there bare-assed, pontificating about tribes.

730
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,533
You've got to understand, you think that when you do interviews, like Mr. Tucker,

731
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,366
who did an interview there, that... that

732
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,966
you're about to "make them friends." How could you...

733
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:05,666
What does this have to do with friends? He's different.

734
00:49:06,633 --> 00:49:09,133
He is... he is simply different.

735
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,333
- But it's still necessary. - A mammoth stands before you.

736
00:49:13,766 --> 00:49:17,700
- By the way, I must say that when you said "bare-assed", it was not translated.

737
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,800
Could the interpreter please translate?

738
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,570
- This is so that you can understand. - Thank you.

739
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:23,195
Now he explained everything to me, I understand.

740
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:25,227
- Yeah? That's great. - Now I fully understand.

741
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:27,724
- That's great. - Anyway, but we still need to talk.

742
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,900
- One should always speak with someone who listens.

743
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:34,933
And you must speak when you know that this will

744
00:49:34,966 --> 00:49:39,066
benefit you, bring peace and calm to the world.

745
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:40,366
not the other way around.

746
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:46,266
I love President Trump's message, when he speaks.

747
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:50,633
I, I think that we share a position on peace

748
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:52,900
through strength. That is very important.

749
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:55,366
It means that if you are strong,

750
00:49:56,266 --> 00:50:00,166
you can speak. And we need to be strong.

751
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:04,066
And Ukraine has to be strong. Strong enough.

752
00:50:05,633 --> 00:50:08,600
Otherwise, what for? So, He...

753
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:19,066
You..you know who, like.. like Voldemort, who must... who must not be named.

754
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:22,900
Yes he's, he's like Voldemort, he

755
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,533
thrives, subsists and lives on being subjectivized.

756
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:33,833
Instead of isolation, he is offered to step out into the light.

757
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:38,566
He's darkness personified, and you offer him, as it were,

758
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:43,333
to be subjectivized. Why? There's only one reason

759
00:50:44,866 --> 00:50:45,833
Fear.

760
00:50:46,766 --> 00:50:50,900
And you say, we need to talk. Listen, we need to be

761
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:55,333
in a strong position and not talk, but end the war.

762
00:50:55,866 --> 00:51:00,266
Yes, it is possible through dialogue. We're not opposed to it.

763
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:07,233
You just need to be in a strong position to make the other person want it.

764
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:09,300
Do you think he wants to end the war?

765
00:51:10,566 --> 00:51:14,133
That's what you suggested. I think this is naive. I'm sorry.

766
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:17,866
With all due respect, it's naive to think he wants to finish the war.

767
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
- Tell you what...

768
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:24,900
- ...the circumstances. Sorry for interrupting.

769
00:51:25,466 --> 00:51:30,366
There's something we need. I think that President Trump not only has will.

770
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,100
He has all these possibilities and it's not just talk.

771
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,033
I really count on him and I think that our people

772
00:51:38,066 --> 00:51:44,033
really count on him. So. He has enough power

773
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,966
to pressure him, to pressure Putin...

774
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:53,333
not into wanting to stop it. No, he will not want to.

775
00:51:53,466 --> 00:51:56,066
To pressure him to actually stop it. That is the

776
00:51:56,066 --> 00:52:00,533
difference. Don't rely on his will, Putin's will to stop.

777
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:01,733
You won't see it.

778
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:03,933
That's what I think. Sorry.

779
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:06,666
- No, sorry, I interrupted you first.

780
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,400
But what I would want...

781
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:15,000
I do have what some, what some might call a naive dream of you

782
00:52:15,033 --> 00:52:19,700
sitting down with Putin and Trump and negotiating a deal about...

783
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,566
a ceasefire. And together finding a path to long-term peace.

784
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,200
And I think this requires strength, requires negotiations.

785
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,900
There are a lot of carrots and sticks here that can be used to make a real deal.

786
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,366
And Trump is very keen on making a deal and ready to negotiate.

787
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:43,066
- Can I ask you a question? Yeah?

788
00:52:44,366 --> 00:52:48,933
I just really want you and I to be on the same page.

789
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:57,566
It's very important to be in the same information space. Extremely important.

790
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,433
Let's talk a bit about the ceasefire.

791
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:04,400
Let me describe the situation to you.

792
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:10,800
In December 2019, in Normandy, in Paris, at the

793
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:15,466
Elysee Palace, Macron, Merkel, Putin and I agreed

794
00:53:16,733 --> 00:53:20,900
on the ceasefire. The US wasn't there, and this,

795
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,733
by the way, was a weak point of the meeting.

796
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:28,866
If you'd like, we can later discuss why they weren't there, it's a

797
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:34,266
security guarantee thing in general, it's Germany's position, etc.

798
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,633
We agreed on an exchange of hostages, an all-for-all exchange.

799
00:53:39,666 --> 00:53:42,733
We made a deal to exchange everyone for everyone. I think you know that.

800
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:46,300
And there was also a meeting that lasted many hours.

801
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,633
A meeting where we made... we made a deal with him.

802
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,166
Everyone was tired, it was just the two of us in the end.

803
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,666
and I proposed a ceasefire.

804
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,833
By the way, no one in Ukraine believed, few believed

805
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,133
in the ceasefire, and he wanted troop withdrawal.

806
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:07,933
I calculated that if there were a withdrawal

807
00:54:08,333 --> 00:54:10,100
of troops from the line of contact

808
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,200
the way Russians proposed, it would take 20 years.

809
00:54:13,866 --> 00:54:16,600
I proved it to him. Just in terms of time.

810
00:54:17,066 --> 00:54:23,066
Square kilometers, namely the length of the line of contact or delimitation line.

811
00:54:23,166 --> 00:54:28,333
And we agreed on what I told him, that... it will not work out.

812
00:54:28,633 --> 00:54:32,733
But, but I, I had many points because I was deeply

813
00:54:32,733 --> 00:54:36,300
involved in the issue. I was involved very deeply.

814
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:41,566
It's my thing in general. If I start doing something, I can't stand there

815
00:54:41,566 --> 00:54:45,500
like that guy I spoke about, with my ass out, you know?

816
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:50,800
I must be dressed, I must be prepared.

817
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:56,266
I must be prepared better, better than anyone

818
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,333
in front of me. You do sports, right?

819
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,133
- Mhm.

820
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:03,466
- I practiced for many years. And we know what fights

821
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,366
are like, what boxing is, what Thai boxing is.

822
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,466
This is what I did, and I loved it very much.

823
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,333
When you step into the ring, you understand everything, pretty much.

824
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,433
- Mhm.

825
00:55:16,466 --> 00:55:22,233
- And so I stepped into it, and I was... I was definitely well prepared.

826
00:55:23,333 --> 00:55:25,500
But he wasn't. No.

827
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:29,966
He was not deeply involved in the process. What border?

828
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,000
Where is it? How long will it take to disengage

829
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:37,200
troops? And why wasn't he involved? You want to know?

830
00:55:37,633 --> 00:55:41,966
Because he wasn't going to do any of this. This is what confused me.

831
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,433
If you are not deeply involved in the issue, well, then you... It's...

832
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:52,500
It's as if you don't really need the result. That's what I think.

833
00:55:53,233 --> 00:55:57,500
So what happened? We agreed that there will be

834
00:55:58,966 --> 00:56:00,566
gas continuation...

835
00:56:01,766 --> 00:56:06,033
gas transit. In 2019 we agreed with him.

836
00:56:06,066 --> 00:56:10,100
This was a security for Europe. Merkel asked me for it.

837
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:15,800
And this was extremely important for Germany.. We agreed with him.

838
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:20,133
Secondly, we agreed that... For him, it was just money.

839
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,233
So secondly, we agreed on an exchange.

840
00:56:24,666 --> 00:56:30,333
For me, this was the most important thing. For them, gas was, for me, was the people.

841
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:34,166
And this is a fact because I wanted

842
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,333
to have a humanitarian advantage,

843
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,566
so that there would be further meetings that would lead to sustained peace.

844
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,266
And third.

845
00:56:45,133 --> 00:56:46,233
Ceasefire.

846
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:48,733
Ceasefire you spoke about.

847
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:51,233
What happened?

848
00:56:52,266 --> 00:56:55,733
The gas contract was signed because he needed it.

849
00:56:55,766 --> 00:56:58,533
And, by the way, he knew everything about it.

850
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,633
As for exchange, we took the first step

851
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:05,733
and exchanged the people.

852
00:57:08,366 --> 00:57:09,900
Regarding the ceasefire.

853
00:57:10,866 --> 00:57:14,633
Well... They started killing us

854
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:17,033
in about a month. So...

855
00:57:18,733 --> 00:57:20,100
I called him.

856
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,000
And I told him, "We agreed on a ceasefire, didn’t we?

857
00:57:26,033 --> 00:57:28,100
Well, it wasn't a piece of toilet paper, was it?

858
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:32,900
This is serious business, or so it seemed. It really was serious.

859
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:38,200
Merkel, Macron, you and I, we all agreed on this together.

860
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:42,033
A ceasefire is important, isn't it?

861
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,300
Not for New Year’s, cause everyone was celebrating New Year’s.

862
00:57:46,666 --> 00:57:50,066
And now, they’re offering us a Christmas ceasefire. It’s all the same.

863
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,766
A ceasefire for 2-3 days, just to get some praise.

864
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:55,400
But this isn’t a performance, this isn’t some kind

865
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,600
of theater, no. This, this is about people’s lives.

866
00:57:58,633 --> 00:57:59,900
And that’s what happened.

867
00:58:00,466 --> 00:58:03,200
After that, I called him a few more times.

868
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:05,933
I think I only had 2-3 calls with him in total.

869
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,033
I asked him for a ceasefire. He told me,

870
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:13,000
"It couldn't be. We will...we will figure it out now."

871
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:16,933
People from...people from the occupied territory,

872
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:20,733
Russians and separatists, they were all there together.

873
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:27,966
They continued to shoot and kill our people. Yes, the front lines were quiet.

874
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:30,400
But they killed people.

875
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:35,866
They were killing people, and I kept calling him.

876
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,266
I called again and again, but there was nothing.

877
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,500
Until after a few months, the Russians stopped answering the phone.

878
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,666
We did not have any contact since.

879
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:50,433
I wanted another meeting, like we had in the Normandy.

880
00:58:50,566 --> 00:58:54,100
I wanted the next meeting I wanted to find a solution.

881
00:58:54,366 --> 00:58:56,300
But the Russians refused.

882
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:00,633
We tried to make it happen through various European countries,

883
00:59:00,966 --> 00:59:04,000
and not only European, but the Russians refused.

884
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,300
They passed along some kind of bullshit, made excuses—they didn’t want it.

885
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,733
Meanwhile, they were sending their snipers.

886
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:16,233
We had evidence — living proof, even video evidence —

887
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:18,866
because some of them were captured back then.

888
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:22,066
Those were the snipers in training. They were training them.

889
00:59:22,066 --> 00:59:23,333
They were training them.

890
00:59:23,366 --> 00:59:27,933
And later, those snipers operated in Syria and Africa.

891
00:59:28,233 --> 00:59:32,100
These snipers were training in our country, in the east.

892
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,533
Ukrainians were living targets.

893
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:37,233
They were shooting from the other side, killing

894
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:41,800
people, women, people, children. They were shooting.

895
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:46,566
It was a hunt. By the way, it was in the Russian-speaking region.

896
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,966
In the east, where according to him everyone is speaking Russian.

897
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,866
That's where they were shooting.

898
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:55,533
Where the situation currently is the most tense.

899
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,266
They killed people. We sent this information, sent

900
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:03,200
pictures, we sent them to the UN, sent them everywhere.

901
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,133
We worked very hard, very persistently. I met with

902
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:09,100
everyone, but who thought of Ukraine back then?

903
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,433
They didn't notice it much. They didn't pay much

904
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:18,133
attention to Crimea being illegally occupied either.

905
01:00:18,266 --> 01:00:21,466
And, to be honest, the United States of America too.

906
01:00:21,933 --> 01:00:24,366
Everyone was somewhat silent about this issue.

907
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,633
That's how it was.

908
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:30,600
It was...it was like that before a full-scale war.

909
01:00:30,633 --> 01:00:32,900
I want to ask you a question about the ceasefire.

910
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:40,466
For example, in Mariupol, in Mariupol today.

911
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:47,566
There are American and Ukrainian journalists.

912
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:53,666
And everyone will tell you who had contact, who has contact now with Mariupol.

913
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,500
Who fled from there in the last minutes just before the occupation,

914
01:00:58,733 --> 01:01:02,666
or who was able to leave to escape after the occupation.

915
01:01:02,966 --> 01:01:07,400
Chernov who won an Oscar was among them. And the

916
01:01:07,433 --> 01:01:10,066
journalists that left Mariupol, they are here.

917
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,000
By the way, we had a conversation.

918
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:18,766
They will tell you that 20 thousand, 30 thousand

919
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,700
civilians were tortured and buried there.

920
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,266
We do not know the number of victims.

921
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,900
People who didn't want to work with them, who refused to cooperate with them.

922
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,033
People who went on strikes to protest.

923
01:01:31,066 --> 01:01:34,666
People who did not want to work with the Russians who occupied Mariupol.

924
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:38,500
and this is one example… just with this city. And I have a question for you.

925
01:01:38,566 --> 01:01:41,400
What about the millions of children? And I will ask

926
01:01:41,433 --> 01:01:44,466
you in Russian so that you hear this without delay.

927
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,866
What about the millions of children over there?

928
01:01:47,466 --> 01:01:49,500
What if we just arranged a ceasefire,

929
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,533
without understanding what would happen next.

930
01:01:51,966 --> 01:01:56,733
Without understanding what will happen to Ukraine's security guarantees.

931
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:59,766
What about the millions of children in the

932
01:01:59,766 --> 01:02:02,333
occupied territories? What should I tell them?

933
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:05,866
What am I to tell them? What is it I should tell them?

934
01:02:06,733 --> 01:02:09,000
What? Whatever?

935
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:12,766
Hey, all of you over there... See ya.

936
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:16,333
And those tens of thousands of people buried there, they were...

937
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,333
Is that what we want?

938
01:02:18,666 --> 01:02:20,833
Are we ready to forgive them for this?

939
01:02:21,866 --> 01:02:24,766
We must at least take the first step.

940
01:02:25,433 --> 01:02:28,366
If this is a ceasefire, we must know that there is a

941
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,433
security guarantee for the part of Ukraine under our control.

942
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:35,466
We need it so that he will not come back.

943
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:39,533
This is very important. And what do we say

944
01:02:39,566 --> 01:02:41,666
to the people who live in those territories?

945
01:02:41,666 --> 01:02:48,900
These are millions of people. Did you know, that since 2014, in Donetsk, in the Crimea,

946
01:02:49,366 --> 01:02:54,066
This is happening in Melitopol as well as in Berdyansk now,

947
01:02:54,366 --> 01:02:58,333
they are making all these kids of drafting age

948
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,000
go and fight.

949
01:03:03,566 --> 01:03:05,733
And if they don't go, they will be killed.

950
01:03:05,733 --> 01:03:08,133
This is... do you understand what's happening?

951
01:03:09,066 --> 01:03:10,866
That is why a ceasefire...

952
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,833
Everything I said.

953
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:16,266
What... I wish for...

954
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:19,833
and I believe in President Trump's power to use

955
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:26,566
all of this information to come up with a way to make Ukraine strong.

956
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:30,000
And be strong.

957
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,166
Why am I saying that?

958
01:03:33,733 --> 01:03:35,666
I will give you an example.

959
01:03:37,766 --> 01:03:39,166
President Trump

960
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:44,033
will be in the same situation as I was in 2019.

961
01:03:44,833 --> 01:03:47,000
Precisely the same situation.

962
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:51,200
I want to end the war, we want a lasting peace for Ukraine,

963
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,933
we must do this: the ceasefire, exchange people,

964
01:03:54,966 --> 01:03:58,000
and then diplomatically return all territories,

965
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,533
and we will do this through diplomacy.

966
01:04:01,933 --> 01:04:04,933
What will happen next with President Trump?

967
01:04:05,266 --> 01:04:08,933
If the ceasefire happens without security guarantees,

968
01:04:08,966 --> 01:04:12,533
at least for the territory we control, what does he get?

969
01:04:12,733 --> 01:04:17,000
If he manages to make a ceasefire deal

970
01:04:17,933 --> 01:04:19,500
and three months later...

971
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:24,600
Putin launches a new wave of attacks. What will Trump look like?

972
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:30,566
What will Ukraine look like? What will everyone look like?

973
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:38,100
Putin will just do it. And why would Putin do it? Because today he is afraid of Trump.

974
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:42,433
But once Trump manages for example...

975
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:47,366
to do a ceasefire deal without serious security

976
01:04:47,366 --> 01:04:51,033
guarantees for Ukraine, he will give a pass to Putin.

977
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:55,533
Not that he wants to. No, he does not want that. I believe in what he says.

978
01:04:56,033 --> 01:04:59,133
But he will give Putin an opportunity

979
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:03,400
because in Putin's head, he wants me to fight with Trump.

980
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:08,233
Putin's plan is to end the occupation of our territory.

981
01:05:08,266 --> 01:05:11,266
This is in his sick head.

982
01:05:12,066 --> 01:05:15,166
And... I am absolutely sure of this.

983
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:16,900
That is why I told you,

984
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,766
don't wait for Putin to want to stop the war.

985
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:28,300
Pressure him so that he is forced to stop the war.

986
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,666
That's important.

987
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,066
- It's important to say that what you said about the children is a tragedy.

988
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:35,100
War is hell.

989
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:38,833
But let me say again, we must find a path to peace.

990
01:05:38,866 --> 01:05:40,066
- There is one.

991
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,100
- What is it?

992
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,266
- There is one.

993
01:05:42,266 --> 01:05:45,333
Before ceasefire, strong Ukraine. Strong Ukraine's

994
01:05:45,366 --> 01:05:48,400
position? Yes. we can speak about it with Trump.

995
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,633
For me, we can... we can speak about security guarantees.

996
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:58,066
But a quick step, a quick step, is NATO,

997
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,300
a partial membership NATO... Yes, I understand.

998
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:07,366
I understand, I understand Trump's feelings about NATO. I heard him.

999
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,033
He's thinking through all of it, of course.

1000
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:16,100
But anyway, yes, NATO is a strong security guarantee for all the people, for us.

1001
01:06:16,566 --> 01:06:18,266
Part of the security guarantees.

1002
01:06:18,566 --> 01:06:22,366
The second part is the arms aid package, which we will not use.

1003
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:30,000
If... a ceasefire works, nobody will use the weapons. For what? But it has to stay.

1004
01:06:30,133 --> 01:06:33,133
But with all due respect to the United States

1005
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:35,866
and to the administration, not like before.

1006
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:39,233
I, I don't want the same situation like we had with Biden.

1007
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,900
I ask for sanctions now, please.

1008
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:45,633
And weapons, now. And then we will see.

1009
01:06:45,766 --> 01:06:48,766
If they start it again, of course, we'll be happy if you'll

1010
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,166
give us more and you will stand with us shoulder to shoulder.

1011
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:58,366
Of course, that is right. But... But it's different when you have weapons.

1012
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:03,166
Putin wouldn't have been able to occupy so much territory.

1013
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,666
It was very difficult for us to push him out.

1014
01:07:06,133 --> 01:07:08,666
But we didn't have weapons before. And that is

1015
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:11,600
the same situation; it can be the same situation.

1016
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,433
I'm just sharing this with you.

1017
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,433
Like I said at the very beginning, I want to

1018
01:07:15,466 --> 01:07:18,166
be very honest with you and with your audience.

1019
01:07:18,866 --> 01:07:24,600
Yes, it's true. If we do not have security guarantees, Putin will come again.

1020
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:29,966
- To make it clear, let's describe the idea that you are speaking about...

1021
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:32,366
I would like to offer you other ideas too,

1022
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,100
but right now, your idea is that NATO

1023
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,100
accepts Ukraine minus the five regions of Luhansk, Donetsk,

1024
01:07:40,133 --> 01:07:43,100
Zaporizhia, Kherson and Crimea.

1025
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:48,000
- Just so you understand the situation, the invitation to NATO

1026
01:07:48,633 --> 01:07:51,633
is legislatively issued to Ukraine.

1027
01:07:52,033 --> 01:07:56,066
So to us, all those territories are still Ukraine.

1028
01:07:56,766 --> 01:08:02,800
But NATO so far, can only act in the part that is under Ukrainian control.

1029
01:08:03,066 --> 01:08:07,700
This can be negotiated, I am sure about that. Yes, this would not be

1030
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:12,700
a great success for us, but if we see a diplomatic

1031
01:08:12,733 --> 01:08:16,000
way to end the war, this is one of the ways.

1032
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,733
So it's... sorry,

1033
01:08:17,733 --> 01:08:19,600
that is a start.

1034
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,433
Secondly, weapons. Arms aid package.

1035
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:28,566
I am not ready to discuss this publicly right now. It's all written down.

1036
01:08:28,832 --> 01:08:33,066
And President Trump might have seen it or not. But we've got no secrets from him.

1037
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:37,033
Yes. So, but mostly it depends on the willingness of the United States.

1038
01:08:37,066 --> 01:08:39,966
Because some of it will come from the EU,

1039
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:43,300
some from the United States, of course together.

1040
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,066
So not just from the United States. No, no, no.

1041
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,966
We need unity with this package. So, the package, and sanctions.

1042
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:52,899
Yes, sanctions.

1043
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:56,533
But I think it's in the interest of all the smart people

1044
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,533
to not have Russian energy on the market in general.

1045
01:09:00,733 --> 01:09:03,700
So he, he has to stop it. That's all.

1046
01:09:04,332 --> 01:09:09,366
It's fine. American oil, American gas is okay. Why not? And it's cheaper.

1047
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,899
So it will be cheaper for the whole world. The money will go to the United States.

1048
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:18,433
And I think he will be happy. And the president and your people will be happy.

1049
01:09:18,466 --> 01:09:21,466
But it's your decision, I'm just sharing. Yes, And cheap oil.

1050
01:09:21,466 --> 01:09:27,566
So, Putin won't have so much money for... for the war. And that, that's it.

1051
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:30,000
- But this is difficult because it's a lot.

1052
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:34,300
You're saying to continue the sanctions on Russia, to accept Ukraine into NATO.

1053
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:37,200
I need to ask you some difficult questions about this.

1054
01:09:37,566 --> 01:09:38,566
- Yes, go on.

1055
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:43,233
- I trust and respect your words today. Many people respect and love you in America.

1056
01:09:43,332 --> 01:09:44,666
Trump respects you.

1057
01:09:46,166 --> 01:09:47,166
- Loves me?

1058
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:50,166
- Oh, come on now. Remember, last time you

1059
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,733
corrected me when I said that you love Javier Milei.

1060
01:09:52,765 --> 01:09:56,700
You said, "No, no, no." "I respect him." So let's not talk about love today.

1061
01:09:57,566 --> 01:10:02,966
But could we talk seriously about... about guaranteeing Russia's security?

1062
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,033
- Okay, can I interview you a little?

1063
01:10:06,066 --> 01:10:08,566
Question is: what land is the war happening on?

1064
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,800
And where did it start?

1065
01:10:11,366 --> 01:10:16,433
On our soil, on our territory, international law was violated,

1066
01:10:16,433 --> 01:10:19,766
the sovereignty of our country was violated,

1067
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,433
civilians were killed, tens of thousands of our people

1068
01:10:23,533 --> 01:10:24,966
were taken hostage.

1069
01:10:24,966 --> 01:10:29,966
And everyone will tell you this happened. This is what happened.

1070
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,066
When I speak with the Global South, which is trying to

1071
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:36,000
balance the two sides because of the history, because of their

1072
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,066
roots, and because of their shared economic interests

1073
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:46,233
with Russia in the past, and now, of course, when you talk to them,

1074
01:10:46,933 --> 01:10:50,000
they are speaking a little bit like you.

1075
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:52,866
I mean, they're balancing a little bit, you know.

1076
01:10:52,966 --> 01:10:56,600
Yeah, a little bit in-between. But we will work on it.

1077
01:10:56,666 --> 01:10:57,333
- Yeah.

1078
01:10:57,433 --> 01:11:01,174
- It's...it's our first meeting. During the second one, you will be more on our side.

1079
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:02,976
- Yeah. - But it's just...just...just...

1080
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,657
- You're very convincing. - We will see.

1081
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:05,642
- Very charismatic.

1082
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:10,033
- Yeah, thank you. But when I speak with them, when I speak, it's very important.

1083
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:16,933
Even with their balancing attitude towards the war.

1084
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:18,733
They all

1085
01:11:19,466 --> 01:11:22,366
recognize that this is a war.

1086
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:30,766
This is not just internal conflict. This is a full-scale war

1087
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,866
that began... that Putin began.

1088
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:41,733
And all of them, all of them, if you talk to them, they say... "Mmhh..."

1089
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:48,300
But then they all recognize that... that it's his own big

1090
01:11:49,533 --> 01:11:54,533
mistake. Putin's mistake. And that he's not right.

1091
01:11:55,333 --> 01:12:00,233
That's why I said, "No, no, he's not right." And you have to begin from this.

1092
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,700
If you begin at the middle between Ukraine

1093
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:06,166
and Russia, of course we can speak like this.

1094
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,233
You are in the middle and say, okay, what's

1095
01:12:08,266 --> 01:12:10,700
going on? There is a fight. Where is the fight?

1096
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,900
It's not the fight like...like in Europe when Napoleon

1097
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:20,200
is fighting against somebody in the middle of Europe.

1098
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:24,500
No, this is not in the middle of somewhere of the planet.

1099
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,800
Not the planet. It's concretely on our land. So one

1100
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:37,966
country with one army, one person came to another. That's it. It's very clear.

1101
01:12:38,366 --> 01:12:41,366
- Again, I would like us to find a path to peace.

1102
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,966
So, let us nevertheless try to start in the middle.

1103
01:12:45,166 --> 01:12:50,533
What other ideas do you think might... You are a very intelligent person. And...

1104
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:52,766
- Your Russian isn't that good either!

1105
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:54,686
And I told you...

1106
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:56,276
- Yes - ...that this is only our first meeting.

1107
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,233
- My English is not very good either.

1108
01:12:58,233 --> 01:12:59,900
- Your English is very good.

1109
01:12:59,966 --> 01:13:03,366
- Thank you. To be honest, I'm terrible at speaking in every language.

1110
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:05,866
Well, there... there are other ideas.

1111
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:08,113
For instance, sorry to say this, it sounds crazy, but

1112
01:13:08,137 --> 01:13:10,163
- Please - What if both

1113
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:12,475
Ukraine and Russia are accepted into NATO?

1114
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:17,200
- Putin himself spoke about Russia, maybe about NATO.

1115
01:13:17,766 --> 01:13:19,800
What you just said is very correct.

1116
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,200
What are the guarantees for Russia?

1117
01:13:23,266 --> 01:13:26,600
It's not like I'm even interested what happens to them.

1118
01:13:26,633 --> 01:13:31,066
To be honest, I don't care what will happen to them in the future after the war ends.

1119
01:13:31,941 --> 01:13:32,966
But,

1120
01:13:34,733 --> 01:13:38,000
these are our borders, and we must understand what is

1121
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:41,733
going on there. Well, the NATO guarantees for Ukraine.

1122
01:13:43,233 --> 01:13:46,366
Actually, this is also a security guarantee for the Russians.

1123
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:49,833
Frankly, I talked about this many times before.

1124
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:55,200
Sorry, I'm speaking figuratively, but as an example,

1125
01:13:55,233 --> 01:13:57,766
if you were a father who lost his children...

1126
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,833
A grown man,

1127
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:02,800
A grown man, a man, an adult.

1128
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:06,366
And the war has ended.

1129
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:11,000
And he never got, never got justice.

1130
01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:15,566
For real. For example, somebody decides to freeze support.

1131
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,566
"We won't give you anything, you can't fight,

1132
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,733
you can't continue." So we stop when we stop.

1133
01:14:20,766 --> 01:14:22,266
Without any guarantees, without any

1134
01:14:22,266 --> 01:14:25,333
support, without financing, without... Okay.

1135
01:14:26,866 --> 01:14:30,933
And nobody is held accountable...

1136
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:36,500
But the man lost his children. He... He will not get anything.

1137
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,033
None of the killers will be in prison.

1138
01:14:39,066 --> 01:14:44,200
All the sanctions will be removed. And he lost his children.

1139
01:14:45,066 --> 01:14:47,766
And we have thousands of such people.

1140
01:14:47,866 --> 01:14:52,366
Why do you think they will not go to Russia?

1141
01:14:53,066 --> 01:14:56,066
Will find a way and will not kill the Russian

1142
01:14:56,066 --> 01:14:59,466
soldiers there or somebody there? Why wouldn't they.

1143
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:05,300
It's human nature. It's not about us. It's everyone. Read American writers.

1144
01:15:05,366 --> 01:15:08,066
Always after any war.

1145
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,400
if there is no justice for people

1146
01:15:13,766 --> 01:15:16,766
there must be punishment for the crime.It is only justice.

1147
01:15:16,866 --> 01:15:19,300
How come my child was taken away?

1148
01:15:19,366 --> 01:15:21,066
The war took him.

1149
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,466
This is very scary. And even...

1150
01:15:24,566 --> 01:15:27,866
Whether it was my son who was fulfilling his constitutional duty

1151
01:15:27,966 --> 01:15:28,966
or simply

1152
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,866
a missile that struck a civilian child.

1153
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:35,800
If there is no justice and the killers are not punished,

1154
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,566
why wouldn't these people come back with hate?

1155
01:15:42,066 --> 01:15:46,500
They will definitely come back. So when we talk about NATO,

1156
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,700
NATO

1157
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,100
is not only stopping Russia.

1158
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:53,200
Do not forget,

1159
01:15:53,266 --> 01:15:54,466
NATO

1160
01:15:54,566 --> 01:15:56,766
is stopping us too.

1161
01:15:57,866 --> 01:16:01,266
Because there will not be justice for everyone.

1162
01:16:01,566 --> 01:16:07,000
We know that NATO does not have the right to solve certain issues with war.

1163
01:16:07,166 --> 01:16:12,700
NATO is a security alliance, it is protection, not brainwashing.

1164
01:16:12,766 --> 01:16:16,566
What Putin claims, that this is offensive, is not true.

1165
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:22,500
NATO is a defensive alliance, a security alliance, and it is security for Russia.

1166
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:26,466
- But, unfortunately, there are many options for peace

1167
01:16:26,866 --> 01:16:31,166
that don't involve NATO inviting Ukraine as a member.

1168
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:35,200
Can you imagine security guarantees without NATO membership?

1169
01:16:35,266 --> 01:16:36,266
For example,

1170
01:16:36,366 --> 01:16:38,066
if America simply

1171
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,166
leaves NATO.

1172
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:41,000
I believe there is a

1173
01:16:41,066 --> 01:16:44,766
high likelihood that Donald Trump would do such a thing.

1174
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,300
- I think it's very bad for NATO.

1175
01:16:47,366 --> 01:16:48,700
That's the end.

1176
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:50,366
That is...

1177
01:16:50,466 --> 01:16:51,966
That's the death of NATO.

1178
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:53,074
It is

1179
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,600
a pity because I think that it's a very good alliance.

1180
01:16:55,666 --> 01:16:57,000
Maybe not everything is good there

1181
01:16:57,066 --> 01:16:59,500
from the bureaucracy or money etc.

1182
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:01,566
But totally,

1183
01:17:01,666 --> 01:17:04,400
countries who are in NATO, they...

1184
01:17:04,466 --> 01:17:06,800
They don't fight.

1185
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:10,666
There is no war on the land of any

1186
01:17:10,766 --> 01:17:12,466
of these NATO countries.

1187
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:13,966
I think that is the answer.

1188
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,666
It works or not.

1189
01:17:15,766 --> 01:17:18,800
It works politically or militarily. I don't know.

1190
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,900
But it works. So without Trump

1191
01:17:22,066 --> 01:17:23,166
without

1192
01:17:23,266 --> 01:17:26,366
the United States of America there will not be NATO.

1193
01:17:26,466 --> 01:17:27,700
That is the first.

1194
01:17:27,766 --> 01:17:28,900
So...

1195
01:17:28,966 --> 01:17:31,633
And you say, can we imagine that,

1196
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,766
that what?

1197
01:17:32,866 --> 01:17:34,766
- That there could be security guarantee without...

1198
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,600
- No, we don't need

1199
01:17:37,266 --> 01:17:39,966
guarantees without the United States.

1200
01:17:40,066 --> 01:17:44,966
That's it. Because the United States is a very strong, powerful country.

1201
01:17:45,066 --> 01:17:47,300
The United States puts the point.

1202
01:17:47,366 --> 01:17:51,300
Of course, Putin said that it's just the Soviet Union,

1203
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,000
where, by the way, Ukraine was the second

1204
01:17:54,066 --> 01:17:56,300
strong republic militarily.

1205
01:17:56,366 --> 01:17:58,600
Yes, by the way, but he

1206
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:01,300
of course always forgets about it.

1207
01:18:01,366 --> 01:18:04,066
But during the World War Two

1208
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:06,166
without help of the United States,

1209
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,566
support of your troops,

1210
01:18:07,666 --> 01:18:11,966
support of your industry,industrially, militarily,

1211
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,666
without your money, without your people,

1212
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:19,366
Hitler could, could win.

1213
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:24,566
So the United States helped a lot, of course, Europe,

1214
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,733
USSR, and of course, everybody fought,

1215
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,166
everybody did a lot, but

1216
01:18:30,266 --> 01:18:33,300
without the United States, it couldn't be such,

1217
01:18:33,366 --> 01:18:35,066
I don't use the word "success",

1218
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:36,366
because I think that

1219
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:40,666
there is no war which ends successfully,

1220
01:18:40,766 --> 01:18:43,500
because this is a war, seven-figure losses,

1221
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:46,866
heavy losses in World War II,

1222
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,666
millions of people, and that's why without the

1223
01:18:49,733 --> 01:18:54,066
United States security guarantees are not possible.I mean,

1224
01:18:54,133 --> 01:18:56,200
these security guarantees,

1225
01:18:56,266 --> 01:18:59,733
which can prevent Russian aggression.

1226
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:02,900
Of course, we have security guarantees, bilaterally

1227
01:19:02,966 --> 01:19:04,966
with some countries: financing,

1228
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,366
support of our internal military and defending

1229
01:19:08,466 --> 01:19:12,100
and humanitarian issues and de-mining, which is very important,

1230
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,366
and helping our children

1231
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,366
in the school networks, by the way, this is a very sensitive point.

1232
01:19:18,466 --> 01:19:21,066
How many, how many bomb shelters?

1233
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,966
How many bomb shelters we built

1234
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:24,633
with the partners for the children?

1235
01:19:24,633 --> 01:19:28,466
And it's a pity that they are underground, but...

1236
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,966
Can you imagine their eyes

1237
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:32,166
when they came after COVID,

1238
01:19:32,266 --> 01:19:33,966
you understand what does it mean COVID,

1239
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,100
but they had COVID and the war

1240
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:39,566
and together they didn't see each other for so many years.

1241
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:42,200
And when they saw each other,

1242
01:19:42,266 --> 01:19:47,166
even underground, they were very happy and smiling.

1243
01:19:47,266 --> 01:19:51,300
So, we have such security guarantees.

1244
01:19:51,366 --> 01:19:54,966
But it's not enough to prevent,

1245
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,200
Yes, preventive measures also work.

1246
01:19:57,266 --> 01:20:00,966
To prevent the aggression of Putin. To stop.

1247
01:20:01,066 --> 01:20:04,666
-  Your English is better than my Russian. This is so... this is wonderful.

1248
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:07,766
- I'm not sure. - I'm just giving you a compliment.

1249
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,800
- Thank you! No, no, thank you.

1250
01:20:08,866 --> 01:20:10,600
- You're supposed to do that kind of thing to a president.

1251
01:20:10,666 --> 01:20:14,900
- Thank you so much. - Okay. Once again.

1252
01:20:14,966 --> 01:20:17,033
- Come on! - Without NATO guarantees.

1253
01:20:17,266 --> 01:20:18,966
I have a dream that,

1254
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:24,066
let's say, on January 25 or sometime at the end of January this year,

1255
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,900
you will sit down

1256
01:20:25,966 --> 01:20:28,800
with Donald Trump, with Vladimir Putin

1257
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,900
and together negotiate a ceasefire

1258
01:20:30,966 --> 01:20:33,766
with strict security guarantees.

1259
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:38,700
And an agreement will be signed.

1260
01:20:38,766 --> 01:20:41,466
What will this look like without NATO?

1261
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:43,200
- I will make it clear.

1262
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:44,966
And so, first of all,

1263
01:20:45,066 --> 01:20:46,300
I think,

1264
01:20:46,366 --> 01:20:47,866
January 25

1265
01:20:47,966 --> 01:20:49,000
or some other day,

1266
01:20:49,066 --> 01:20:51,766
well, you just call it January 25,

1267
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:55,300
and I don't mind, it's my birthday.

1268
01:20:55,366 --> 01:20:59,666
And we sit down,

1269
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,900
first of all with Trump.

1270
01:21:03,666 --> 01:21:06,500
We agree with him on how

1271
01:21:06,566 --> 01:21:10,866
we can stop the war, stop Putin.

1272
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:15,700
It is important for us to sit down with him.

1273
01:21:16,266 --> 01:21:20,366
Secondly, it is very important for us that Europe,

1274
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,800
which is very important for us because

1275
01:21:23,866 --> 01:21:26,166
we are part of Europe.

1276
01:21:26,266 --> 01:21:29,266
And not only geographically, geopolitically,

1277
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:31,800
but also in the European Union — where we will be.

1278
01:21:31,866 --> 01:21:36,900
For us, it is very important that Europe also has a voice.

1279
01:21:37,366 --> 01:21:40,600
It's the second thing. It won't be long

1280
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:44,633
because Europe will be looking at us and will be looking at Trump.

1281
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,466
And, by the way, I now see that

1282
01:21:48,566 --> 01:21:51,000
when I talk about something with Donald Trump,

1283
01:21:51,066 --> 01:21:54,166
whether we meet in-person or we just have a call,

1284
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,166
all the European leaders always ask how was it.

1285
01:21:57,266 --> 01:22:01,266
This, shows the influence of Donald Trump,

1286
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:03,500
and this has never happened before

1287
01:22:03,566 --> 01:22:06,066
with an American president,

1288
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,300
I tell you from my experience.

1289
01:22:08,366 --> 01:22:13,400
This also gives you confidence, you know, that he can

1290
01:22:13,466 --> 01:22:15,066
stop this war.

1291
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:17,466
That is why, we and Trump come first,

1292
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:21,166
and Europe will support Ukraine's position

1293
01:22:21,266 --> 01:22:23,666
because they understand

1294
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:27,800
that Ukraine has every right to have its voice heard in this,

1295
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,700
because we are at war.

1296
01:22:29,766 --> 01:22:32,766
Trump and I will come to an agreement,

1297
01:22:32,866 --> 01:22:35,033
and then, if...

1298
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,366
And I am sure that he can offer strong

1299
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,066
security guarantees

1300
01:22:40,133 --> 01:22:41,466
together with Europe.

1301
01:22:41,566 --> 01:22:45,033
And then we can talk to the Russians.

1302
01:22:45,233 --> 01:22:50,266
That's right. Not just three of us sitting down at once.

1303
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,400
And you still talk to me like that,

1304
01:22:54,466 --> 01:22:55,766
do you know how?

1305
01:22:55,866 --> 01:22:59,166
As if Putin wants to sit down and talk,

1306
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,400
but Ukraine does not. This is not true.

1307
01:23:02,466 --> 01:23:06,066
- I think that, yes, he is in fact ready to talk.

1308
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,166
- Did you talk to him? - On the phone or what?

1309
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,700
- How do you normally talk to him?

1310
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:13,666
- I don't know, normally by the sea, the same as with you.

1311
01:23:13,766 --> 01:23:15,566
He invites you to the sea with me,

1312
01:23:15,633 --> 01:23:17,066
just the three of us.

1313
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,266
- No, no, one of us may drown.

1314
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:21,966
- Who? Are you good at swimming? - Yes, I am a good swimmer.

1315
01:23:21,991 --> 01:23:24,157
- You're a good swimmer? Well...

1316
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:28,066
- And I would like to add that

1317
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:30,166
if you have any contact with them,

1318
01:23:30,266 --> 01:23:32,666
I just want to hear what happens then.

1319
01:23:32,766 --> 01:23:35,266
- I have never talked to Vladimir Putin.

1320
01:23:35,366 --> 01:23:39,100
But I have a feeling that he is ready

1321
01:23:39,166 --> 01:23:40,933
because Donald Trump is ready.

1322
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,900
I hope you're ready.

1323
01:23:43,566 --> 01:23:46,366
And this is not just a feeling, but a dream.

1324
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:48,366
I have a dream here

1325
01:23:48,466 --> 01:23:51,466
that the three of you will get together in a room.

1326
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,566
And make peace.

1327
01:23:55,466 --> 01:23:57,866
And I want to understand what it looks like,

1328
01:23:57,966 --> 01:23:59,766
what security guarantees look like

1329
01:24:00,066 --> 01:24:03,566
that would satisfy Ukraine, that would satisfy Russia.

1330
01:24:04,066 --> 01:24:08,066
- Ukraine needs security guarantees, first and foremost.

1331
01:24:08,166 --> 01:24:10,200
We are in danger.

1332
01:24:10,266 --> 01:24:12,566
That is why they are called so.

1333
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,866
This is no joke to me.

1334
01:24:15,966 --> 01:24:18,966
Let's take a few steps back.

1335
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:20,566
Interesting.

1336
01:24:23,066 --> 01:24:24,933
Why are security guarantees,

1337
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,466
a strong position of Ukraine, strong weapons, and so on so important?

1338
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:33,233
I will give you a little history lesson.

1339
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,300
Although

1340
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:38,166
I think you have prepared yourself and know everything perfectly.

1341
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,566
Well, you can correct me on that.

1342
01:24:40,633 --> 01:24:45,866
Yes. Ukraine had security guarantees,

1343
01:24:45,966 --> 01:24:48,200
the Budapest Memorandum. Nuclear weapons are

1344
01:24:48,233 --> 01:24:50,266
the security guarantees that Ukraine had.

1345
01:24:50,366 --> 01:24:52,866
Ukraine had nuclear weapons.

1346
01:24:52,966 --> 01:24:56,166
I do not want to characterize it as good or bad.

1347
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,866
Today, the fact that we do not have them is bad. Why?

1348
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Because this is war. Today we are at war

1349
01:25:03,066 --> 01:25:05,966
because you unleashed... we... because...

1350
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,366
you have unleashed the hands of a nuclear power.

1351
01:25:09,466 --> 01:25:12,400
A nuclear power is fighting against us,

1352
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:13,866
against Ukraine,

1353
01:25:13,966 --> 01:25:15,466
and doing what it wants.

1354
01:25:15,566 --> 01:25:19,700
By the way, even you are now talking about ceasefire.

1355
01:25:19,766 --> 01:25:21,600
Just a ceasefire.

1356
01:25:22,866 --> 01:25:25,666
Maybe give flowers flowers to Putin,

1357
01:25:25,766 --> 01:25:28,466
maybe to say "thank you so much for these years.

1358
01:25:28,566 --> 01:25:30,400
That was a great part of my life."

1359
01:25:30,466 --> 01:25:34,800
No, we are not just ready for this. Why?

1360
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:39,000
The Budapest Memorandum, nuclear weapons. This is what we had.

1361
01:25:39,066 --> 01:25:42,600
Ukraine used them for protection.This does not mean that someone

1362
01:25:42,666 --> 01:25:46,000
attacked us, that doesn't mean that we would have used it,

1363
01:25:46,066 --> 01:25:47,900
we had that opportunity.

1364
01:25:47,966 --> 01:25:50,000
These were our security guarantees.

1365
01:25:50,066 --> 01:25:54,700
Why am I talking about this in detail? Because if you take the Budapest Memorandum,

1366
01:25:54,766 --> 01:25:58,333
by the way, I discussed this with President Trump.

1367
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,166
We have not finished this conversation yet,

1368
01:26:01,266 --> 01:26:02,466
we will continue it.

1369
01:26:02,566 --> 01:26:05,066
Regarding the Budapest Memorandum.The Budapest

1370
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,966
Memorandum included security guarantees for Ukraine.

1371
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
at first three...three.

1372
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,366
The most important security guarantors for Ukraine.

1373
01:26:14,466 --> 01:26:17,600
Three strategic friends

1374
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,566
and partners of Ukraine.

1375
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,000
This was in agreement.

1376
01:26:23,066 --> 01:26:24,966
United States of America,

1377
01:26:25,066 --> 01:26:27,366
Russia, Britain.

1378
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,566
France and China joined. There were 5 states that...

1379
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,700
These are not even security guarantees.

1380
01:26:34,766 --> 01:26:37,866
We now understand that this is not a guarantee of security.

1381
01:26:37,966 --> 01:26:41,600
Because, on the one hand, these are security guarantees,

1382
01:26:41,666 --> 01:26:45,700
but there was an English word, as far as I understand, "assurance".

1383
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:52,166
It is translated as "assurance", assurance right?

1384
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,566
And in Russian it will be... And ...

1385
01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:58,400
What? Assurance.

1386
01:26:59,266 --> 01:27:03,966
That is, give up nuclear weapons because you were under pressure of

1387
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:07,566
the US and Russia

1388
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:11,233
for Ukraine to give them up.

1389
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:14,466
These two powers were exerting pressure.

1390
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:16,900
These two states negotiated to ensure

1391
01:27:16,966 --> 01:27:19,100
that Ukraine does not have nuclear weapons.

1392
01:27:19,166 --> 01:27:20,366
Ukraine agreed.

1393
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,333
These...these are the largest states.

1394
01:27:22,533 --> 01:27:24,066
This is the nuclear five

1395
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:27,400
that does not, not even provide security guarantees.

1396
01:27:27,466 --> 01:27:29,600
Now we just need to find these people,

1397
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:32,566
and we just need to put in jail all of those who,

1398
01:27:32,633 --> 01:27:35,600
frankly, invented all this.

1399
01:27:36,566 --> 01:27:38,500
So, confidence

1400
01:27:38,566 --> 01:27:41,533
so confidence...Assurance,

1401
01:27:42,066 --> 01:27:45,300
Assurance, that Ukraine will be

1402
01:27:45,366 --> 01:27:47,866
territorially integral

1403
01:27:47,933 --> 01:27:50,066
with its sovereignty.

1404
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,966
It was a piece of paper.

1405
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:59,033
If you are curious, by the way, that after occupying part of our Donbas

1406
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:03,966
and Crimea, Ukraine sent diplomats three times,

1407
01:28:04,033 --> 01:28:08,000
I don't think I remember, three times within a few years.

1408
01:28:08,133 --> 01:28:10,633
We sent letters to all security guarantors,

1409
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,466
to all members of the Budapest Memorandum.

1410
01:28:13,666 --> 01:28:14,866
What did they send?

1411
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,600
That what was written on the piece of paper.

1412
01:28:18,866 --> 01:28:20,200
Consultations.

1413
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:26,266
Ukraine holds consultations if its territorial integrity is violated.

1414
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:29,633
And everyone should be in consultation.

1415
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,166
Everyone must come.

1416
01:28:32,466 --> 01:28:35,000
Everyone must meet urgently.

1417
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,600
USA, Britain, Russia.

1418
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:41,866
France, China.

1419
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:46,266
Did anyone come, you ask? No.

1420
01:28:46,366 --> 01:28:48,800
Did anyone reply to these letters,

1421
01:28:48,866 --> 01:28:51,733
official letters, they are all recorded by diplomats.

1422
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,100
Did anyone conduct consultations? No.

1423
01:28:55,166 --> 01:28:57,833
And why not? They didn't give a fuck.

1424
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:01,066
This is understandable in Russian, right?

1425
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:02,766
That as Russia didn't

1426
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,233
give a damn, neither did

1427
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:08,666
all the other security guarantors of the Budapest Memorandum.

1428
01:29:08,733 --> 01:29:13,800
None of them gave a damn about this country, these people, these

1429
01:29:13,866 --> 01:29:17,066
security guarantees, etc.

1430
01:29:17,666 --> 01:29:18,933
We take a break.

1431
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,466
This will be a Budapest memorandum.

1432
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:25,300
The last time with me, imagine how many years, it was with me,

1433
01:29:25,366 --> 01:29:28,133
in February 2022.

1434
01:29:29,366 --> 01:29:33,133
In February 2022. he war began.

1435
01:29:33,233 --> 01:29:35,200
A full-scale war.

1436
01:29:35,466 --> 01:29:38,866
Letters for consultations have been sent.

1437
01:29:39,066 --> 01:29:40,900
No one answers.

1438
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,166
Next.

1439
01:29:43,233 --> 01:29:45,900
We are taking a break from the Budapest Memorandum.

1440
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,933
The question is simple about Budapest. Can we trust this? No.

1441
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,966
Whichever country out of these five sat at the negotiating table,

1442
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,966
just a, a piece of paper...

1443
01:29:57,966 --> 01:30:01,500
Believe me, we will save you

1444
01:30:01,566 --> 01:30:04,066
No. Another.

1445
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,400
This is a train,

1446
01:30:06,466 --> 01:30:09,566
this is a train with waste paper,

1447
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:11,700
with security guarantees,

1448
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:16,500
which Ukraine has been riding for many years.

1449
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:19,166
The second car on this train

1450
01:30:19,433 --> 01:30:20,866
is the Minsk agreements.

1451
01:30:20,966 --> 01:30:24,133
The Normandy format and the Minsk agreements,

1452
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,766
where it was written,

1453
01:30:26,066 --> 01:30:27,900
where the signatories were.

1454
01:30:27,966 --> 01:30:30,333
The United States of America was no longer there.

1455
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:32,966
I understand that Obama was here at the time.

1456
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,066
And as far as I know, I think they were simply not interested in

1457
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:37,700
what happened to Ukraine

1458
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:40,300
and where it was in general, where it was located.

1459
01:30:40,366 --> 01:30:42,100
Well, somewhere there.

1460
01:30:42,166 --> 01:30:43,566
Part of something.

1461
01:30:43,633 --> 01:30:44,700
People, well,

1462
01:30:44,766 --> 01:30:47,700
people and let it be. Let it be with these people.

1463
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:51,500
The United States simply did not participate

1464
01:30:52,066 --> 01:30:53,700
in the Minsk agreements.

1465
01:30:54,133 --> 01:30:58,200
There are no claims to the US because they were not guarantors.

1466
01:30:58,566 --> 01:31:00,366
Where is the claim?

1467
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,333
A step back.

1468
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:05,233
2008.

1469
01:31:05,433 --> 01:31:06,966
Bucharest.

1470
01:31:07,066 --> 01:31:08,900
Everyone has already learned

1471
01:31:08,966 --> 01:31:11,300
from the Budapest Memorandum.

1472
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:12,500
Bucharest.

1473
01:31:12,566 --> 01:31:14,166
2008.

1474
01:31:14,233 --> 01:31:15,733
Bucharest.

1475
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:17,766
Mr. Bush,

1476
01:31:17,966 --> 01:31:20,766
President of the United States,

1477
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,466
Republican,

1478
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:25,600
says that Ukraine should be in NATO.

1479
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,466
This is the voice of Republicans.

1480
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,166
Check it out.

1481
01:31:30,566 --> 01:31:32,666
Ukraine should be in NATO.

1482
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:34,966
Everybody is looking at the US.

1483
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,033
Always.

1484
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:37,100
All in favor.

1485
01:31:37,166 --> 01:31:39,066
Who is against? Merkel.

1486
01:31:39,133 --> 01:31:40,300
So she opposes.

1487
01:31:40,366 --> 01:31:42,266
And she forced everyone not to give

1488
01:31:42,333 --> 01:31:43,400
Ukraine

1489
01:31:43,466 --> 01:31:46,066
an invitation to join NATO because that would be a step.

1490
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:48,900
Seriously. Republicans were in favor.

1491
01:31:48,966 --> 01:31:50,666
The US was in favor.

1492
01:31:50,766 --> 01:31:52,666
Because Republicans

1493
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:53,933
and Bush

1494
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,166
were not afraid of anyone.

1495
01:31:56,266 --> 01:31:58,533
They were not afraid of anyone. And they knew

1496
01:31:58,533 --> 01:32:00,600
that Ukraine rightly wanted to join NATO.

1497
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:01,666
She chooses so.

1498
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,266
And what is the question?

1499
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,033
Well, people made their choice. Well?

1500
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,466
And the Russians will not look that way.

1501
01:32:08,533 --> 01:32:10,066
That was not the case then.

1502
01:32:10,133 --> 01:32:12,300
Why? Because the Russians were

1503
01:32:12,366 --> 01:32:14,233
different.

1504
01:32:16,266 --> 01:32:17,500
Next Minsk...

1505
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:20,100
We didn't succeed.

1506
01:32:20,700 --> 01:32:21,766
After the

1507
01:32:21,833 --> 01:32:23,900
Minsk agreements, as I told you,

1508
01:32:23,966 --> 01:32:25,366
hundreds of meetings

1509
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,766
were held.

1510
01:32:26,966 --> 01:32:28,133
I have had

1511
01:32:28,566 --> 01:32:30,333
hundreds of meetings

1512
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,466
since 2019.

1513
01:32:33,366 --> 01:32:34,500
We could not

1514
01:32:34,566 --> 01:32:36,100
think about a ceasefire.

1515
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:38,766
A ceasefire is our offer.

1516
01:32:38,866 --> 01:32:41,366
This is not somebody's suggestion.

1517
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:44,066
This is mine, I would like.

1518
01:32:44,666 --> 01:32:46,766
I wanted to. In Ukraine,

1519
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,266
society was divided.

1520
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,833
Not everyone wanted to.

1521
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,033
Half did not want to.

1522
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,166
Half were against.

1523
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,266
Half were in favour.

1524
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:55,400
Some of them shouted:

1525
01:32:55,466 --> 01:32:56,533
"Do not believe it."

1526
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:58,333
Some of them shouted: "Believe it."

1527
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,066
I am the president of Ukraine.

1528
01:33:01,100 --> 01:33:05,433
I was given a mandate of trust by 70% of the population

1529
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:08,966
to take appropriate steps. And I made them.

1530
01:33:09,833 --> 01:33:13,000
This is not a joke, We'll just sit the three of us.

1531
01:33:13,266 --> 01:33:14,533
I am

1532
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,466
simply telling you what is.

1533
01:33:16,533 --> 01:33:19,366
This is how can I tell you,

1534
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,566
these meetings

1535
01:33:21,666 --> 01:33:22,933
must be

1536
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,866
serious and prepared.

1537
01:33:25,566 --> 01:33:27,866
And prepared with those who want peace.

1538
01:33:27,966 --> 01:33:29,500
Ukraine wants peace,

1539
01:33:29,566 --> 01:33:31,100
US wants peace.

1540
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:32,600
We have to sit down with Trump,

1541
01:33:32,666 --> 01:33:34,400
and that is.100%,

1542
01:33:34,466 --> 01:33:36,633
first and foremost number one.

1543
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,366
Moreover, he told me on the phone that...

1544
01:33:39,466 --> 01:33:41,600
he is waiting for us to meet

1545
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,400
and there will be

1546
01:33:43,466 --> 01:33:44,633
an official visit,

1547
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,200
and my visit would be

1548
01:33:46,266 --> 01:33:48,366
the first or one of the first to him.

1549
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,633
And for him, this topic is very important.

1550
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:53,066
I know that he has his own matters,

1551
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,800
American issues, I understand.

1552
01:33:54,866 --> 01:33:56,633
I heard his election program,

1553
01:33:56,700 --> 01:33:57,866
but regarding

1554
01:33:57,966 --> 01:33:59,433
international affairs,

1555
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,466
I think our issue is

1556
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:03,400
one of the most pressing issues

1557
01:34:03,466 --> 01:34:04,700
for President Trump.

1558
01:34:04,733 --> 01:34:07,266
Therefore, I believe very much, I trust his words.

1559
01:34:07,366 --> 01:34:09,033
And I hope we will meet again.

1560
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:10,566
We need to

1561
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,766
prepare,

1562
01:34:11,833 --> 01:34:13,866
we have many plans to build on,

1563
01:34:13,933 --> 01:34:14,966
and they exist,

1564
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:16,066
and they are

1565
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:17,866
supported by many countries,

1566
01:34:17,933 --> 01:34:19,200
but we need

1567
01:34:19,266 --> 01:34:20,933
his vision.

1568
01:34:21,566 --> 01:34:23,866
He needs to look at all these details,

1569
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:25,866
but his vision, please.

1570
01:34:25,933 --> 01:34:32,166
Because he can stop Putin, because Putin is afraid of him. That's a fact.

1571
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:38,666
But Trump is a president of a democratic country, and he does not come for

1572
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:45,300
life, he is not Putin, he will not come for 25 years, he will come for his term.

1573
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,600
Please tell me,

1574
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:51,266
well, for example, he came for 4 years,

1575
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,433
and for the 5th year

1576
01:34:56,233 --> 01:34:57,800
Putin came with a war.

1577
01:34:58,166 --> 01:35:01,300
Will it make Trump feel better that there was no war

1578
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:04,533
during his time and that Ukraine was destroyed after him?

1579
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,066
Why destroyed?

1580
01:35:07,333 --> 01:35:12,300
Putin is whoever, a killer, whoever, but not a fool. He...

1581
01:35:13,733 --> 01:35:19,100
will be prepared. He knows all mistakes. He understands how we defeated his

1582
01:35:19,133 --> 01:35:21,500
army after the invasion began.

1583
01:35:21,533 --> 01:35:24,366
He realized that this was not a Soviet war and that

1584
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:27,600
this would not happen with us. He will prepare.

1585
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,066
He will let everything into arms production. He will have

1586
01:35:31,066 --> 01:35:34,233
lots of weapons and there will be a very large army.

1587
01:35:34,266 --> 01:35:39,800
And you think that after such humiliation, four years without a war,

1588
01:35:40,133 --> 01:35:45,833
he did not finish us, he will return and fight only against Ukraine?

1589
01:35:46,633 --> 01:35:48,633
He will destroy everything around.

1590
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:52,400
And if you say there is a risk that Trump, President Trump,

1591
01:35:52,433 --> 01:35:54,766
will withdraw from NATO, for example,

1592
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,600
this is a decision of the United States,

1593
01:35:56,633 --> 01:36:00,033
I am simply saying that if it does, Putin will destroy Europe.

1594
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,600
Calculate the size of army in Europe.

1595
01:36:04,266 --> 01:36:07,966
It's just that I say it for a reason. Do the calculation.

1596
01:36:08,366 --> 01:36:12,033
Why did Hitler conquer all of Europe then? Almost.

1597
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:16,733
Just count, remember his armies of millions.

1598
01:36:17,633 --> 01:36:23,133
Calculate what Europe has. What are the largest armies? We have the largest army.

1599
01:36:24,033 --> 01:36:26,666
The Ukrainian army is the largest in Europe.

1600
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:32,100
The second place after us is four times smaller than us.

1601
01:36:32,874 --> 01:36:33,941
- France?

1602
01:36:33,966 --> 01:36:40,933
- Yes, 200 thousand. I think the French have about 200 thousand. We have 980.

1603
01:36:41,566 --> 01:36:44,166
- So this powerful coalition of European nations.

1604
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,533
- That will not be enough.

1605
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:49,000
- Yes, it's not going to be enough, but you're a smart man with a lot of ideas.

1606
01:36:49,033 --> 01:36:54,766
Partnerships with Global South, India, Middle East, Saudi

1607
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:59,933
Arabia, ekonomicheskie partnerships, political partnerships.

1608
01:37:00,166 --> 01:37:01,433
It all protects you.

1609
01:37:01,466 --> 01:37:03,833
- First of all, look at one example.

1610
01:37:06,733 --> 01:37:07,933
North Korea.

1611
01:37:08,733 --> 01:37:10,333
Just look at this example.

1612
01:37:11,866 --> 01:37:13,233
12 thousand.

1613
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,200
Has arrived.

1614
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:18,933
Today

1615
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:24,266
3,800 killed or wounded.

1616
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:28,433
They can bring more

1617
01:37:28,966 --> 01:37:31,000
30–40 thousand,

1618
01:37:34,433 --> 01:37:37,166
or maybe 500.

1619
01:37:40,066 --> 01:37:46,800
They can bring many people. Why? Because they have order, autocracy and everything.

1620
01:37:46,966 --> 01:37:50,700
Can Europe bring people together? No.

1621
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:55,500
Will Europe be able to build an army consisting of 2-3

1622
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,566
million people? No. Europe will not want to do this.

1623
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,833
And for what? We definitely don't want a

1624
01:38:00,866 --> 01:38:04,300
world war with you. There is no such purpose.

1625
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:07,566
There is no such purpose as gathering everyone.

1626
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:10,100
We do not want any war. We want to stop the Russians.

1627
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:15,466
And they invite... North Korean soldiers. Invited.

1628
01:38:19,066 --> 01:38:20,800
Their faces are burned.

1629
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:28,200
They themselves burn their faces. Those who cannot escape, injured or killed.

1630
01:38:29,033 --> 01:38:33,266
There is a video. Everything I am telling you, there is evidence of this.

1631
01:38:34,133 --> 01:38:36,000
So that they are...

1632
01:38:36,266 --> 01:38:38,333
not recognizable, right?

1633
01:38:39,533 --> 01:38:41,700
It means, what does it mean?

1634
01:38:43,466 --> 01:38:47,366
It's out of values which share Europe. Europe counts.

1635
01:38:48,133 --> 01:38:52,966
It means that those guys they don't count.

1636
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,800
"Rahuyut." It's "count" yes?

1637
01:38:54,833 --> 01:39:00,500
They don't count the number of people. That is the answer. Can they move more? Yes.

1638
01:39:00,533 --> 01:39:04,466
Can they move dozens of thousands? Yes, because we see what they have.

1639
01:39:05,233 --> 01:39:11,466
Last year, for example, Europe gave us one million artillery rounds.

1640
01:39:12,866 --> 01:39:19,600
We produced a lot ourselves, but they gave us initiative, it was initiative.

1641
01:39:20,066 --> 01:39:24,500
One million artillery rounds, and...

1642
01:39:25,866 --> 01:39:28,800
And of 155 and etc.

1643
01:39:29,533 --> 01:39:31,066
We produced more.

1644
01:39:33,233 --> 01:39:40,066
But North Korea gave Putin 3.7. Just gave him.

1645
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:44,466
So he also has a deficit for today. It means he needs what?

1646
01:39:44,566 --> 01:39:45,766
He needs time.

1647
01:39:46,375 --> 01:39:49,275
- But the number of soldiers... - Yes.

1648
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:52,600
- And the number of artillery rounds is not everything.

1649
01:39:53,966 --> 01:40:00,400
As you said, let's say Trump guarantees security for 4 years.

1650
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:07,166
You can form partnerships with India, with Saudi Arabia that enforce

1651
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:13,933
punishment, the stick, on oil prices, for example, if any aggressive action is taken.

1652
01:40:14,233 --> 01:40:18,166
You can actually even build, I've met a lot of

1653
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,300
incredible Ukrainian tech people, IT people.

1654
01:40:22,833 --> 01:40:25,666
You can build great companies that form partnerships with

1655
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:28,466
the United States, that form partnerships with China.

1656
01:40:29,066 --> 01:40:33,300
And that is a big leverage against the aggression of

1657
01:40:34,033 --> 01:40:36,766
however many million artillery rounds.

1658
01:40:36,966 --> 01:40:41,233
And that, a sheet of paper, you don't need a sheet of paper for protection.

1659
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:43,516
- Ah, that's, you, you...

1660
01:40:44,366 --> 01:40:46,033
Well, when you speak.

1661
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:48,933
- In English. - In English, yeah.

1662
01:40:48,933 --> 01:40:53,000
You don't even need answers because when you now were

1663
01:40:53,033 --> 01:40:56,333
talking, you already answered on all the questions.

1664
01:40:56,466 --> 01:40:57,600
The first one

1665
01:40:58,466 --> 01:41:02,666
is that during this time, you need just cooperation,

1666
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:05,866
a lot of money for this military industry.

1667
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:11,900
In Ukraine or in Europe, with India, Saudi Arabia,

1668
01:41:12,066 --> 01:41:15,600
Saudi, and the United States, you need a lot of money.

1669
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:20,133
So the question is where you will get it. So my answer was to Trump.

1670
01:41:20,433 --> 01:41:24,900
I said, this is one of the security guarantees. Take 300 billions

1671
01:41:25,366 --> 01:41:29,100
of frozen Russian assets. We will take it.

1672
01:41:29,566 --> 01:41:32,566
Take money, what we need for our interior production.

1673
01:41:32,566 --> 01:41:36,833
And we will buy all the weapons from the United States. We don't need gifts

1674
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:40,400
from the United States. It will be very good

1675
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:43,066
for your industry. For the United States.

1676
01:41:43,233 --> 01:41:47,100
We will put money there. Russian money. Not Ukrainian.

1677
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:49,666
Not European. Russian money. Russian assets.

1678
01:41:49,700 --> 01:41:50,866
They have to pay for this.

1679
01:41:51,233 --> 01:41:55,600
We will put it and we will make it. This is one of security guarantees? Yes, of course.

1680
01:41:55,700 --> 01:41:58,833
Because this is a military guarantee. Yes.

1681
01:41:59,233 --> 01:42:05,533
But...Then the second you said that energy price and a lot of

1682
01:42:05,566 --> 01:42:09,866
sanctions on products and the Russian shadow fleet and etc.

1683
01:42:09,933 --> 01:42:14,966
That is the second answer we spoke about before. Yes, put more sanctions on them.

1684
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:20,733
More sanctions. It's okay. Not, but not to take off sanctions. - [Lex] It's okay,

1685
01:42:20,733 --> 01:42:24,500
- It's okay with you, but it's not going to be okay with the president of Russia.

1686
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:29,100
- Yes, but I'm not thinking how it will be very good for him. He's still a killer.

1687
01:42:29,266 --> 01:42:32,866
- I understand, but unfortunately, the reality is that

1688
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:35,033
a compromise is needed in order to reach an agreement.

1689
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:37,300
- So, in your understanding the fact that he

1690
01:42:37,333 --> 01:42:39,433
is no in-jailed after all the murders...

1691
01:42:39,666 --> 01:42:42,266
He is not in-jailed assuming all the murders...

1692
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:47,866
And no one in the world is able to put him in his place, send him to prison.

1693
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:50,066
Do you think this is a small compromise?

1694
01:42:50,533 --> 01:42:52,566
- This is not a small compromise. And

1695
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,566
to forgive him will not be a small compromise.

1696
01:42:55,566 --> 01:42:59,833
- To forgive — no one will forgive. This is absolutely impossible to forgive him.

1697
01:42:59,866 --> 01:43:03,266
We cannot get into the head and soul of a person who lost their family.

1698
01:43:03,266 --> 01:43:07,000
Nobody, never will accept this, absolutely

1699
01:43:07,033 --> 01:43:09,333
impossible. I don't know, do you have children?

1700
01:43:09,333 --> 01:43:10,958
- No, not yet, - Okay.

1701
01:43:10,982 --> 01:43:12,483
- But I would like to.  - Yes.

1702
01:43:12,508 --> 01:43:14,833
God bless. And this is the most important

1703
01:43:14,866 --> 01:43:17,966
thing in life. And they simply took away the most precious thing from you.

1704
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Will you ask

1705
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,266
who ruined your life before going to rip their head off?

1706
01:43:23,766 --> 01:43:26,233
I'm just curious. They took your child away.

1707
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:29,933
Are you going to ask, who did this? And they will answer, that that dude did this.

1708
01:43:29,966 --> 01:43:33,000
You will say, "Oh, well, then there are no questions." No.

1709
01:43:33,333 --> 01:43:39,100
No, no you will go, fucking hell, and bite their head off! And it will be fair.

1710
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:42,733
Can murderers be forgiven? That's why...

1711
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:45,633
you make

1712
01:43:46,066 --> 01:43:47,366
security guarantees,

1713
01:43:47,366 --> 01:43:50,433
what I told you, for those who are here, and what we

1714
01:43:50,466 --> 01:43:53,333
control, and what will not happen, and that those who

1715
01:43:53,366 --> 01:43:58,400
lost, we will... we will never forget. And a matter of time.

1716
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:04,000
But when you gave us NATO, I just said, this means that after a while,

1717
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,733
everything I said about NATO, after a while Ukraine will not go against Russia.

1718
01:44:10,433 --> 01:44:13,300
And Russia will not go against Ukraine because you are

1719
01:44:13,333 --> 01:44:16,300
in NATO. I am just saying, is not that a compromise?

1720
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:20,533
So NATO is a compromise. This is not just a security guarantee.

1721
01:44:20,933 --> 01:44:22,100
In my opinion.

1722
01:44:23,066 --> 01:44:25,300
Look, when rockets were attacking Israel.

1723
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,733
And Israel is not in NATO.

1724
01:44:29,866 --> 01:44:32,800
NATO countries aircrafts were deployed.

1725
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:36,033
Air Defense

1726
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,466
The air defense worked.

1727
01:44:39,366 --> 01:44:44,533
Operated by different Middle Eastern countries.

1728
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:46,933
These are also security guarantees.

1729
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:53,633
And, by the way, Israel has nuclear weapons.

1730
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:59,000
So why do they need NATO when in fact they have more than NATO has?

1731
01:44:59,033 --> 01:45:02,766
The American, British and French aviation stepped in

1732
01:45:03,966 --> 01:45:08,966
- There was ADA, I don't remember, from... from Jordan...

1733
01:45:09,833 --> 01:45:14,266
Listen, thousands of missiles were shot down that way. This is...this is...

1734
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:17,366
what is this? So, it's a guarantee of safety.

1735
01:45:17,466 --> 01:45:19,966
It's just that it's not called NATO.

1736
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:25,433
Is some Uncle Vova irritated by the word NATO?

1737
01:45:25,466 --> 01:45:27,366
There's a problem with the word?

1738
01:45:28,433 --> 01:45:31,566
And I think he is simply irritated by people… who…

1739
01:45:31,666 --> 01:45:33,766
who are alive and living here.

1740
01:45:33,866 --> 01:45:35,066
- If you believe this,

1741
01:45:35,133 --> 01:45:39,166
it will be very difficult to negotiate. If you think that the president of a country

1742
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:40,966
is completely crazy,

1743
01:45:41,066 --> 01:45:44,366
it is really hard to come to an agreement with him.

1744
01:45:44,433 --> 01:45:47,233
You have to look at him as a

1745
01:45:47,266 --> 01:45:49,366
serious person who loves his country.

1746
01:45:49,733 --> 01:45:51,266
And loves the people in his country.

1747
01:45:51,266 --> 01:45:53,816
And he conducts, yes, destructive military actions.

1748
01:45:53,841 --> 01:45:56,300
- Who are you talking about now? Who loves his country?

1749
01:45:56,333 --> 01:45:59,533
- Putin. Do you think he doesn't love his country?

1750
01:46:00,333 --> 01:46:04,333
- No. What is his country? He happened to consider Ukraine his country.

1751
01:46:04,366 --> 01:46:06,266
What is his country? Explain it.

1752
01:46:06,333 --> 01:46:08,366
Tomorrow he will say that it's America.

1753
01:46:08,666 --> 01:46:10,333
No pity for the Chechens?

1754
01:46:11,066 --> 01:46:13,233
Do they look like Russians?

1755
01:46:13,366 --> 01:46:15,766
do they speak Russian?

1756
01:46:16,533 --> 01:46:18,466
Of, of course…

1757
01:46:18,566 --> 01:46:22,133
Of course they learn in schools, like anywhere there's been Russification.

1758
01:46:22,833 --> 01:46:24,266
Who are the Chechens?

1759
01:46:24,766 --> 01:46:26,466
A different people.

1760
01:46:28,166 --> 01:46:31,133
Another faith. Other people.

1761
01:46:31,666 --> 01:46:34,466
Another language. A million.

1762
01:46:35,066 --> 01:46:36,533
Eliminated.

1763
01:46:37,966 --> 01:46:41,633
And eliminated how? How did he kill them?

1764
01:46:42,233 --> 01:46:43,466
With love?

1765
01:46:43,533 --> 01:46:45,466
I know, fuck, by hugging.

1766
01:46:45,666 --> 01:46:49,833
In Ukrainian, as we… as we say: Strangling by hugging.

1767
01:46:50,033 --> 01:46:51,366
I love you so so much.

1768
01:46:51,466 --> 01:46:53,666
I love you so much that I want to kill you.

1769
01:46:54,133 --> 01:46:57,466
That's his love. And that's not love.

1770
01:46:57,666 --> 01:46:58,600
You're mistaken.

1771
01:46:59,266 --> 01:47:01,033
He does not love his people.

1772
01:47:01,266 --> 01:47:02,733
He loves his inner circle.

1773
01:47:02,866 --> 01:47:04,733
It's only a small part of the people.

1774
01:47:04,966 --> 01:47:07,366
He doesn't love them.

1775
01:47:09,333 --> 01:47:10,833
Why? I'll explain.

1776
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:12,466
You cannot send

1777
01:47:13,466 --> 01:47:15,766
your people to another land.

1778
01:47:16,633 --> 01:47:18,033
To die.

1779
01:47:18,566 --> 01:47:19,666
Knowing

1780
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:22,066
that they will die.

1781
01:47:22,766 --> 01:47:28,133
Children. My, my daughter, my daughter, she is

1782
01:47:28,833 --> 01:47:30,466
she is 20 years old.

1783
01:47:30,966 --> 01:47:31,866
For me,

1784
01:47:32,033 --> 01:47:34,733
this is a child. She is already an adult,

1785
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:39,966
of course, but she is…she is a child. The boys…

1786
01:47:40,033 --> 01:47:42,733
The boys he sends, are 18 years old.

1787
01:47:42,833 --> 01:47:44,433
18 years old.

1788
01:47:44,566 --> 01:47:47,066
They are children. He sends them.

1789
01:47:47,633 --> 01:47:52,766
It's not that fascists came to his land and he needs to defend it.

1790
01:47:54,166 --> 01:47:56,166
He, he came to ours

1791
01:47:56,233 --> 01:47:57,466
and he sent them.

1792
01:47:58,166 --> 01:48:00,300
Chechnya... he sent them.

1793
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:02,700
Syria... he sent them.

1794
01:48:02,866 --> 01:48:04,700
Africa... he sent them.

1795
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:07,300
Georgia... he sent them.

1796
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:10,600
Moldova, Transnistria, that was before him.

1797
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,800
Fine, we can leave that aside; he has enough sins of his own.

1798
01:48:13,866 --> 01:48:17,466
And, and then there's Ukraine, the largest part.

1799
01:48:21,366 --> 01:48:24,900
780 thousand.

1800
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:29,700
788,000 killed or,

1801
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,566
or wounded.

1802
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,300
Russians.

1803
01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:36,266
He calls them all Russians,

1804
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:38,000
even those who don't know,

1805
01:48:38,066 --> 01:48:40,266
who don't know how to speak Russian

1806
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,466
on his territory of Russia...

1807
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,300
Everything they've enslaved.

1808
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:45,600
Yes.

1809
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,400
Proud Varangians.

1810
01:48:48,066 --> 01:48:51,800
So I wonder, is that love? What love is this, and...

1811
01:48:51,866 --> 01:48:54,000
...for what? Does he love his people?

1812
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:55,066
No.

1813
01:48:55,700 --> 01:48:59,566
Does he love his land? His country is bigger than America.

1814
01:48:59,766 --> 01:49:01,400
How much land do you need?

1815
01:49:01,466 --> 01:49:02,966
America is huge.

1816
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,866
America is simply an outstanding country. Outstanding country.

1817
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,033
Russia is bigger.

1818
01:49:12,666 --> 01:49:14,366
Well, just bigger.

1819
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,900
So... so ask yourself,

1820
01:49:16,966 --> 01:49:18,300
does he love them?

1821
01:49:18,966 --> 01:49:20,200
What is he doing?

1822
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:21,700
And what does he love?

1823
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:24,866
Do you think he's been everywhere?

1824
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:26,400
In his Russia?

1825
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:28,500
It's impossible to get around it.

1826
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,100
He hasn't been everywhere.

1827
01:49:30,500 --> 01:49:31,866
He just hasn't.

1828
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:34,700
- Well, I believe that Donald Trump loves America,

1829
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,258
And I don't think he has been...

1830
01:49:36,283 --> 01:49:37,775
- I'm sure. - ...to every single American city.

1831
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,400
- No, no, no... I saw his rallies.

1832
01:49:41,666 --> 01:49:44,000
- So many rallies...  - Yes, yes... - No, no let's...

1833
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:46,000
let's be honest. Let's be honest.

1834
01:49:46,066 --> 01:49:47,566
He had it, and I saw it,

1835
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,700
and it's very difficult.

1836
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:51,000
He's not, I mean, he's not 18,

1837
01:49:51,100 --> 01:49:52,500
yes, but he's strong,

1838
01:49:53,266 --> 01:49:54,566
and this is his will.

1839
01:49:55,766 --> 01:49:57,200
Everywhere where the war is.

1840
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,300
I'm sure...

1841
01:50:00,300 --> 01:50:03,900
I pray to God it never will be on your land, yes,

1842
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,033
and I'm sure that it will not be,

1843
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:10,066
but I'm sure that... If you have in some region the problems…

1844
01:50:10,866 --> 01:50:12,166
how to say, earthquake,

1845
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:13,300
hurricane,

1846
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:14,500
you have it all...

1847
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,900
Well, I'm sure that President Trump

1848
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:20,733
would be there

1849
01:50:21,366 --> 01:50:23,266
after one day, two or three days.

1850
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:26,400
I don't know the security of all these things, but he will be.

1851
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:28,466
Otherwise, how will people look at him?

1852
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,600
Yes, of course, he will. Of course.

1853
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:33,300
The same about me.

1854
01:50:33,866 --> 01:50:36,566
I'm not comparing myself with him. I'm just…

1855
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:39,300
...where it is difficult for people, I have to come.

1856
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:40,433
The question…

1857
01:50:40,500 --> 01:50:43,000
The next question is very simple.

1858
01:50:44,266 --> 01:50:45,366
Region.

1859
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:47,766
Kursk region

1860
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:50,266
The operation there.

1861
01:50:52,466 --> 01:50:53,566
Did Putin…

1862
01:50:53,700 --> 01:50:57,100
...was Putin in... in Kursk during…

1863
01:50:57,366 --> 01:50:59,200
during four months?

1864
01:50:59,266 --> 01:51:00,100
No.

1865
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,166
- Listen, I have... tremendous respect for you,

1866
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:05,300
admiration for many reasons,

1867
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:08,166
one of which is you stayed in Kyiv.

1868
01:51:08,566 --> 01:51:12,100
And another one is that you visit the front,

1869
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:13,900
and you talk to the soldiers on the front,

1870
01:51:13,966 --> 01:51:15,833
and you talk to people all across Ukraine.

1871
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,500
Absolutely tremendous respect for that, so...

1872
01:51:19,549 --> 01:51:22,549
- Thank you so much. - And not enough people say...

1873
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,400
that, you know...

1874
01:51:24,466 --> 01:51:28,700
I had a conversation with Tucker Carlson, for example, and...

1875
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:31,500
...you know, I said that you're a hero for staying in Kyiv.

1876
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:34,800
And he said: well, he just did the thing that every leader should do.

1877
01:51:36,366 --> 01:51:40,266
But I think not enough leaders do the thing that every leader should do.

1878
01:51:40,466 --> 01:51:41,466
So...

1879
01:51:41,566 --> 01:51:42,600
tremendous respect.

1880
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,100
- Thank you so much. - And I agree with you totally.

1881
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:47,066
Yes, a leader should go to the front of a war.

1882
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:52,900
You know... that said, America has waged wars all across the world.

1883
01:51:52,966 --> 01:51:55,000
That has... the war in ...in...

1884
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:57,500
...in Afghanistan and Iraq

1885
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:03,000
cost... nine trillion dollars and killed over a million people.

1886
01:52:05,566 --> 01:52:07,000
War is hell.

1887
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:11,266
And... just because war is waged in...

1888
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:12,800
...in terrible ways that it is,

1889
01:52:12,866 --> 01:52:15,266
it does not mean the leader does not love their country.

1890
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,566
But I take your point.

1891
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:19,300
I once again have a dream...

1892
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:20,966
that...

1893
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:25,400
Even if there's hate, that you sit down with Donald Trump

1894
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:29,300
and Vladimir Putin and you find a way to peace.

1895
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:32,300
Let me ask you a question.

1896
01:52:32,366 --> 01:52:33,300
What do you think?

1897
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:34,700
Will there ever be a day when

1898
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,666
the Ukrainian people forgive the Russian people,

1899
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:40,900
and both peoples will travel back and forth again?

1900
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,366
And marry each other.

1901
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,066
Rekindle and form friendships.

1902
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:47,900
Will there be such a time in the future?

1903
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,766
- I think history has long answered this question.

1904
01:52:51,966 --> 01:52:54,533
I don't know how it will be for us,

1905
01:52:55,766 --> 01:52:57,300
it will be in the future.

1906
01:52:57,466 --> 01:53:01,100
Without a doubt, history has shown this time

1907
01:53:01,166 --> 01:53:04,666
and again... after every devastating war.

1908
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:07,666
One generation,

1909
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:09,700
one country

1910
01:53:09,766 --> 01:53:12,900
recognizes that it

1911
01:53:16,066 --> 01:53:17,266
is...

1912
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,666
was an aggressor,

1913
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,000
and it comes to realize

1914
01:53:24,266 --> 01:53:26,200
this is impossible to forgive.

1915
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,700
This is precisely the kind of

1916
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,800
education they've had in Germany for many years,

1917
01:53:31,866 --> 01:53:34,233
even though these children had nothing to do with it.

1918
01:53:34,366 --> 01:53:36,200
It was their grandfathers who...

1919
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:40,100
who participated, and not all of them were participants

1920
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:41,900
of

1921
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:46,100
Nazi Germany's war against, essentially against the world.

1922
01:53:46,533 --> 01:53:52,200
Yes. And against life. And therefore, they're still

1923
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:54,000
apologizing.

1924
01:53:54,300 --> 01:53:59,000
Apologizing is not easy. They know that they were the aggressors,

1925
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:00,500
they were guilty.

1926
01:54:00,866 --> 01:54:04,100
They do not look for compromise in history.

1927
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,000
Compromise, in itself, buys time.

1928
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,266
And they understand this.

1929
01:54:09,333 --> 01:54:11,066
There are convicted murderers,

1930
01:54:11,100 --> 01:54:15,900
condemned both historically and by their own people.

1931
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,200
Reparations have been paid,

1932
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:22,466
And security guarantees have been established. By the way...

1933
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:23,900
and all this is done.

1934
01:54:23,966 --> 01:54:27,266
And when all this is done and recognized,

1935
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:28,566
in any case

1936
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:31,766
people develop relations

1937
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:33,000
with each other.

1938
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,566
That's clear, but it can only

1939
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:37,100
happen

1940
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:40,700
the way it always has... always has in history.

1941
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:43,200
Russia will have to apologize.

1942
01:54:44,166 --> 01:54:45,200
It will.

1943
01:54:45,266 --> 01:54:47,666
This will happen because they are guilty.

1944
01:54:48,366 --> 01:54:50,500
They are guilty. And as I told you,

1945
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:52,200
the guilty are different.

1946
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,100
Both those who participated

1947
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:56,866
and... and those who remained silent.

1948
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,266
Because... silence is also about participating.

1949
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,000
In my opinion.

1950
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,466
- Can I ask about Donald Trump?

1951
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,100
We've already mentioned him a lot,

1952
01:55:11,266 --> 01:55:12,300
but

1953
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:13,400
let's focus there.

1954
01:55:14,566 --> 01:55:18,000
What do you admire, what do you respect about Donald Trump?

1955
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:21,700
And also maybe why do you think he won

1956
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:23,966
overwhelmingly

1957
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:28,200
the election in 2024, that American people chose him?

1958
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,166
- He was stronger.

1959
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:34,300
He was much more stronger than Kamala Harris.

1960
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,500
Biden first and then Kamala Harris. Yes?

1961
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,300
He showed that he can...

1962
01:55:39,366 --> 01:55:41,900
he can intellectually

1963
01:55:42,366 --> 01:55:44,100
and physically…

1964
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:49,666
It was an important point to show that if you want to have a strong country,

1965
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:50,933
you have to be strong. And he was strong.

1966
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,600
And this number of...

1967
01:55:52,666 --> 01:55:56,900
rallies, what I said, is not a simple thing. He showed that he can.

1968
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,100
He is strong.

1969
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,900
So he...

1970
01:55:59,966 --> 01:56:04,400
he doesn't have any questions with his, I mean, this age and etc.

1971
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,700
Nothing. He is young.

1972
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:11,633
He is young here, and his brains work. So I think, I think it's important,

1973
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:12,966
very important.

1974
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,666
And, of course, a lot of interior questions.

1975
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:18,633
I understand the the prices and etc.

1976
01:56:18,633 --> 01:56:21,166
Economic questions and the questions of…

1977
01:56:21,366 --> 01:56:24,100
you have the questions with... With other things.

1978
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,900
- Immigration, yeah.

1979
01:56:25,966 --> 01:56:29,833
- A lot of things. I understand. So maybe he answered,

1980
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:33,900
answered on those, on those questions which people had.

1981
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:37,466
- One of the questions... - That he will finish the war.

1982
01:56:37,500 --> 01:56:39,500
- That he will finish the war. - Yeah, for me,

1983
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,600
this is the main question. But I said that for him,

1984
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,900
he's the President of the United States.

1985
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,200
For him, his priority is his questions

1986
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:51,100
in the United States and I understand and I respect it.

1987
01:56:51,166 --> 01:56:52,600
But the second he was

1988
01:56:52,666 --> 01:56:56,000
speaking about the world, yes, he said that he will finish the war.

1989
01:56:56,200 --> 01:56:58,600
And I hope very much.

1990
01:56:59,500 --> 01:57:01,200
Because...

1991
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:02,900
I think that

1992
01:57:03,300 --> 01:57:05,300
that our people really support

1993
01:57:05,566 --> 01:57:06,666
his idea.

1994
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,400
And that's why I said, it is for me, it's very, very important

1995
01:57:12,066 --> 01:57:14,200
to have enough people

1996
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,600
around him

1997
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:20,200
who will have connections with him,

1998
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:25,100
with the right things. For me, the truth is very right things.

1999
01:57:25,966 --> 01:57:28,666
What's going on really on the battlefield?

2000
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:31,000
What's going on really with

2001
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,800
Putin and Russia?

2002
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:35,166
What he really wants?

2003
01:57:35,900 --> 01:57:39,066
And that is just to have it. You know?

2004
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:42,766
Before any decision, you have to be at

2005
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,666
the same level of information.

2006
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:49,400
And we need, really, we need him to know everything

2007
01:57:49,766 --> 01:57:51,200
from us. From you.

2008
01:57:51,266 --> 01:57:54,800
From, from people in Ukraine.

2009
01:57:54,900 --> 01:57:58,200
From people around who are really afraid,

2010
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,200
afraid

2011
01:58:00,666 --> 01:58:03,366
that Putin doesn't want to stop the war,

2012
01:58:03,566 --> 01:58:07,300
afraid that he will come back with his aggression.

2013
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:09,600
- So first of all, I should mention that

2014
01:58:11,066 --> 01:58:12,900
our conversation today will be

2015
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:16,300
translated and dubbed into

2016
01:58:16,733 --> 01:58:19,600
Ukrainian, English, Russian,

2017
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,366
other languages. Spanish.

2018
01:58:23,066 --> 01:58:25,400
So you're in your voice. So, there are

2019
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:28,966
great guys originally from Poland.

2020
01:58:29,033 --> 01:58:33,800
It's a company called Eleven Labs. They use, they've trained an AI.

2021
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,600
Artificial intelligence sounds truly remarkable in your voice.

2022
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:40,100
You have the freedom to speak in any language you choose,

2023
01:58:40,166 --> 01:58:42,200
but no matter what, you will always find yourself

2024
01:58:42,300 --> 01:58:44,400
returning to speaking in Ukrainian.

2025
01:58:44,866 --> 01:58:49,166
That is, when you talk about Donald Trump, you can do it in Ukrainian or Russian.

2026
01:58:49,166 --> 01:58:49,966
Everybody understands.

2027
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:51,566
Everybody understands.

2028
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:56,466
But you said that there's some things about

2029
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:59,800
the war that maybe Americans don't understand.

2030
01:59:00,066 --> 01:59:01,600
So we talked about Putin.

2031
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:06,966
We we talked about the security guarantees, but the reality of war,

2032
01:59:08,766 --> 01:59:12,200
what's happening on the ground, what do you think that people should understand?

2033
01:59:12,900 --> 01:59:16,600
- First of all, they have to understand the idea of Putin's war.

2034
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,866
It is very important for him.

2035
01:59:19,866 --> 01:59:21,800
I consider this process.

2036
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:26,100
I think it is very important for him not to give

2037
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:29,000
Ukraine independence.

2038
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,233
To prevent Ukraine from developing

2039
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:35,466
as an independent country. For him, influence,

2040
01:59:35,966 --> 01:59:38,866
influence on Ukraine cannot be lost.

2041
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,966
And for, for him it is, you know, like

2042
01:59:45,166 --> 01:59:46,933
I think. For him,

2043
01:59:48,066 --> 01:59:50,700
this is such a goal,

2044
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:54,166
in this last mile, and certainly for him.

2045
01:59:54,200 --> 01:59:56,800
The last mile.

2046
01:59:56,966 --> 01:59:58,600
And... of his...

2047
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:05,300
Of his political life.

2048
02:00:06,566 --> 02:00:12,300
And I think that this is the goal for him. The second story...

2049
02:00:13,166 --> 02:00:17,266
I do not want to talk about these banalities, that he wants to return

2050
02:00:17,333 --> 02:00:20,833
all the territories of the Soviet Union, influence over them.

2051
02:00:20,833 --> 02:00:22,166
He does this little by little.

2052
02:00:22,200 --> 02:00:25,966
I just don't want to... People need to know details.

2053
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,700
For example, Georgia, which was headed towards the EU and NATO

2054
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:32,966
completely turns towards Russia, regardless of...

2055
02:00:33,366 --> 02:00:36,333
of the fact that they have frozen conflicts.

2056
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:39,500
They have in Abkhazia what we have with Donbas,

2057
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,200
which is controlled by militant rebels.

2058
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:45,733
Abkhazia is not developing, it's just a part, a very beautiful part of Georgia,

2059
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:46,800
that has died.

2060
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:48,500
And if you have the opportunity,

2061
02:00:48,566 --> 02:00:50,166
then... go there someday,

2062
02:00:50,233 --> 02:00:53,500
you will understand, it simply died because Putin wanted to.

2063
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:56,666
He wanted not to allow them to develop because a frozen conflict

2064
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:58,966
means that you will not be accepted

2065
02:00:59,266 --> 02:01:00,300
in the EU

2066
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:03,608
and certainly will not be accepted into NATO because right now, yes,

2067
02:01:03,633 --> 02:01:06,000
they do not take you because of a frozen conflict.

2068
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,400
And this is what Putin did.

2069
02:01:08,500 --> 02:01:10,933
It's very important for him not to lose this influence.

2070
02:01:10,933 --> 02:01:13,400
That is, he turned back Georgia.

2071
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:17,100
Young people, students, everyone leaves, and this is a fact.

2072
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:18,700
Georgia is quite small.

2073
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,233
And they will leave, they, they want to live in Europe, they want to develop.

2074
02:01:22,366 --> 02:01:24,333
Somebody in the United States, somebody in

2075
02:01:24,333 --> 02:01:26,600
Europe, somebody in the EU, somebody in Britain.

2076
02:01:26,700 --> 02:01:27,900
He will

2077
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,300
he will now fight for the Moldovan parliament.

2078
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:34,600
This is his second step.

2079
02:01:34,666 --> 02:01:36,700
You will see in April what happens.

2080
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:42,100
You will see, oh, he will start turning Moldova away, away from Europe.

2081
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:44,800
Although they want to go there, he does not care.

2082
02:01:44,866 --> 02:01:47,566
There will be a pro-Russian party, and they

2083
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,466
will do something with the current president,

2084
02:01:50,500 --> 02:01:55,400
because she...she has, she has won the the elections, she is pro-European, but he...

2085
02:01:55,466 --> 02:01:58,166
he will turn this back.

2086
02:01:58,500 --> 02:02:02,100
The next steps are completely clear.

2087
02:02:02,166 --> 02:02:05,800
He will do everything wherever he has lost influence,

2088
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:07,400
where there was influence...

2089
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,900
influence of the Soviet Union.

2090
02:02:10,066 --> 02:02:12,500
He'll turn it back as much as possible.

2091
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:16,100
And we understand at what price. You have seen Syria.

2092
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:21,066
You saw these tortures, what we saw in Bucha, what we saw everywhere we came

2093
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:24,100
and where our territories were occupied.

2094
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:26,000
In Syria, the same happened.

2095
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:28,066
There were a thousand people there.

2096
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:32,700
And you have seen it, scientists were found, doctors were found.

2097
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:37,066
It is clear that any people are capable of generating

2098
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:38,900
their own opinion.

2099
02:02:39,766 --> 02:02:42,900
Show their skills, develop society.

2100
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:45,500
Everyone who can express an opinion,

2101
02:02:46,166 --> 02:02:50,166
everyone who can shape the independence and maturity

2102
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,533
of society, such people are not needed.

2103
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,733
And he wants this in Ukraine.

2104
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:56,766
And therefore,

2105
02:02:57,066 --> 02:02:59,500
everyone should understand that Ukraine

2106
02:03:01,066 --> 02:03:02,200
is like

2107
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:04,200
a large wall.

2108
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:08,066
From that Europe. And if, God willing,

2109
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:11,100
President Trump does not withdraw from NATO.

2110
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:15,066
Because, again, I believe that this is the biggest risk.

2111
02:03:15,266 --> 02:03:16,266
I think two steps.

2112
02:03:20,066 --> 02:03:21,600
Two steps that

2113
02:03:22,266 --> 02:03:27,000
Putin would like to see is a weak NATO, and this without Trump?

2114
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:28,900
And...

2115
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:32,266
A weak Ukraine,

2116
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:35,800
which cannot survive on the battlefield, simply cannot survive

2117
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:41,600
and prevent me from building a strong relationship with Trump.

2118
02:03:41,666 --> 02:03:47,366
I think these two steps, leaving NATO and Ukraine's weakness,

2119
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:50,100
will lead to a large-scale war

2120
02:03:51,066 --> 02:03:56,400
which Putin will wage on all the territories of that Europe,

2121
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:01,600
post-Soviet Europe, I mean Soviet Europe, not post-Soviet but

2122
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:05,100
post-World War II period, that is, Soviet Europe

2123
02:04:05,600 --> 02:04:08,600
Soviet-era Europe in order to

2124
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:12,100
completely control everything there.

2125
02:04:12,200 --> 02:04:15,600
This is what he will do. And besides this

2126
02:04:16,866 --> 02:04:20,500
this will happen in any case, even if the US is

2127
02:04:20,566 --> 02:04:23,233
thinking about leaving NATO.

2128
02:04:26,466 --> 02:04:32,300
This war will affect the United States because North Korea is the first sign.

2129
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:36,666
North Korean skills, North Korean knowledge,

2130
02:04:36,666 --> 02:04:39,900
which they are now gaining from this war.

2131
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:48,000
These include mastering new technologies, large-scale drones, missiles, how it works,

2132
02:04:48,066 --> 02:04:52,400
the kind of technological war we have today, cyberwar, etc.

2133
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:57,733
All these skills Korea will bring home and scale up in that region,

2134
02:04:57,866 --> 02:05:03,966
and this will be a risk for the Pacific region, security first and foremost

2135
02:05:04,266 --> 02:05:07,066
for Japan and for...

2136
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:10,666
for South Korea. They will face these risks hundred percent,

2137
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:12,200
and it will be

2138
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:15,900
clear that Taiwan will also

2139
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:17,400
have to face them.

2140
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:19,866
Without this

2141
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:24,200
it is impossible, this is already happening.

2142
02:05:24,266 --> 02:05:27,000
This is already happening.

2143
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:32,566
Therefore, I think that President Trump has all power

2144
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:37,933
to stop Putin and give Ukraine strong security guarantees.

2145
02:05:40,466 --> 02:05:42,700
- We've been talking for two hours.

2146
02:05:42,766 --> 02:05:44,500
Let us pause. You want to take the break?

2147
02:05:44,566 --> 02:05:46,733
- Yeah, we will, we will make a pause.

2148
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,100
- We can have coffee, right? Coffee?

2149
02:05:49,766 --> 02:05:51,900
- Let's do it. - Yeah.

2150
02:05:53,766 --> 02:05:56,525
- And give the interpreter… he is struggling.

2151
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:58,500
- Yeah. Some water. Some water.

2152
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:01,700
- We keep switching languages.

2153
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,300
- Like a dragon, you know? Three heads, three translators.

2154
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,400
- So one of the

2155
02:06:10,066 --> 02:06:13,366
difficult decisions you had to make when the war began

2156
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:15,166
is to enact martial law.

2157
02:06:16,466 --> 02:06:21,100
So, when you won the presidency, you were the warrior for freedom.

2158
02:06:21,566 --> 02:06:24,066
In fact, this war is for freedom,

2159
02:06:24,266 --> 02:06:30,466
for freedom of the individual, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom.

2160
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:34,700
But a lot of freedoms had to be curtailed,

2161
02:06:34,766 --> 02:06:39,500
sacrificed in this fight because there's so much focus on the war.

2162
02:06:39,866 --> 02:06:42,733
Do you see the tension, do you feel the tension

2163
02:06:42,733 --> 02:06:45,300
of that, the sacrifice that had to be made

2164
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,200
in democracy, in freedom,

2165
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,566
in fighting this war?

2166
02:06:51,966 --> 02:06:54,066
- In any case, this war is for

2167
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:56,300
our freedom.

2168
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:58,366
Generally speaking,

2169
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:00,333
to be honest,

2170
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,100
when you understand,

2171
02:07:03,266 --> 02:07:05,500
over time, when the war passes,

2172
02:07:05,566 --> 02:07:08,600
you understand that your main values are

2173
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,300
at home.

2174
02:07:10,700 --> 02:07:15,066
This is your home, your children, your love,

2175
02:07:15,800 --> 02:07:19,800
God willing, parents are alive, and if...

2176
02:07:20,066 --> 02:07:24,900
and if not alive, then their memory, visiting their grave.

2177
02:07:26,166 --> 02:07:28,966
Choosing how to work, how much,

2178
02:07:29,466 --> 02:07:32,100
preferably choosing where to work.

2179
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,800
All this is freedom.

2180
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:38,866
Freedoms are not just a desire, they are an opportunity.

2181
02:07:38,900 --> 02:07:43,000
In any case, you are right because war is a limitation

2182
02:07:43,466 --> 02:07:44,900
of opportunities.

2183
02:07:46,100 --> 02:07:47,300
In any case.

2184
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:51,100
You fight for these opportunities.

2185
02:07:51,266 --> 02:07:54,633
Your parents... Your parents and God

2186
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:56,900
gave you life, right?

2187
02:07:56,966 --> 02:07:58,500
You fight for your life.

2188
02:07:58,666 --> 02:07:59,966
Your life.

2189
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:01,000
But

2190
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:05,633
we need to understand that first there is a war and then martial law is introduced.

2191
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:09,166
Martial law is not introduced because someone

2192
02:08:09,166 --> 02:08:11,900
wanted to. You see, this is not Pinochet.

2193
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,300
This is not Pinochet and so on. This is a completely different story.

2194
02:08:16,466 --> 02:08:20,000
An aggressor came and according to your legislation,

2195
02:08:20,100 --> 02:08:21,766
if the border is violated,

2196
02:08:21,833 --> 02:08:25,266
if there is armed aggression, you have all this written down,

2197
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:28,733
long ago written out in legislation, you introduce martial law.

2198
02:08:28,733 --> 02:08:31,533
And the introduction of martial law everywhere,

2199
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:33,000
at all times

2200
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:37,000
means in any case a restriction of opportunities.

2201
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:40,566
If opportunities are limited, rights and freedoms are restricted,

2202
02:08:41,300 --> 02:08:44,300
therefore, the war itself restricts rights and freedoms.

2203
02:08:44,366 --> 02:08:48,266
Yes... and you can't do anything about it.

2204
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:52,666
We... we try, honestly, to balance.

2205
02:08:53,066 --> 02:08:56,100
As much as possible.

2206
02:08:56,300 --> 02:09:01,000
I believe that the business sector works despite the difficulties of the war

2207
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:07,600
and we do everything, somewhere, you know, there, somewhere to reduce some load.

2208
02:09:07,700 --> 02:09:10,866
Unfortunately, we cannot reduce taxes.

2209
02:09:12,500 --> 02:09:18,466
On the contrary, a military tax is used for war, you need to take money somewhere.

2210
02:09:18,533 --> 02:09:22,900
This, by the way, is about the fact... the fact that the US gave us a lot.

2211
02:09:22,966 --> 02:09:24,533
And Europe too.

2212
02:09:24,766 --> 02:09:27,700
But compared to how much we needed

2213
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:30,500
for the war, this is not all.

2214
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:36,600
As for military salaries, you know, you know that we could not pay the salaries of

2215
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:40,966
a million-strong army, we could not pay it using the money from our partners.

2216
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:43,400
These are all expenses,

2217
02:09:43,466 --> 02:09:49,533
this is all the money that the country and people have accumulated.

2218
02:09:50,600 --> 02:09:52,966
You can't do anything. I really want to reduce taxes,

2219
02:09:53,033 --> 02:09:55,466
I will tell you frankly. I really want to.

2220
02:09:55,766 --> 02:10:00,800
Well, I think that the whole new tax system, new deregulation, new steps,

2221
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:03,700
new reforms, all this will be after the war.

2222
02:10:03,766 --> 02:10:05,900
Although there is something to brag about,

2223
02:10:05,966 --> 02:10:07,100
this is proof.

2224
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,400
And this...

2225
02:10:11,300 --> 02:10:15,300
this is a document because if you want to get a

2226
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:19,300
candidacy for European Union,

2227
02:10:19,366 --> 02:10:21,866
you must implement the appropriate number of reforms.

2228
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:23,666
We do everything.

2229
02:10:24,500 --> 02:10:27,300
During the war, we voted for many reforms,

2230
02:10:27,366 --> 02:10:30,500
including anti-corruption, banking reforms,

2231
02:10:30,566 --> 02:10:32,800
land reforms, major reforms.

2232
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:37,833
We started a large privatization and the war did not stop us.

2233
02:10:37,900 --> 02:10:41,700
Yes, it slowed down, but we went through a lot.

2234
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:44,966
- When do you think you will hold elections?

2235
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,033
Because for people who don't know, as a part

2236
02:10:47,033 --> 02:10:49,100
of the martial law, elections were suspended,

2237
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:52,266
and they were delayed and delayed and delayed. And I think the next

2238
02:10:52,400 --> 02:10:54,500
sort of plan is in February

2239
02:10:54,700 --> 02:10:56,566
of 2025.

2240
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:01,600
But when do you think there will be presidential elections in Ukraine?

2241
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:05,300
- Elections were postponed once.

2242
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:07,700
They were not delayed, to be clear.

2243
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:12,500
Elections did not take place in 2024, that year,

2244
02:11:12,566 --> 02:11:15,166
first of all, we need to understand the Constitution.

2245
02:11:15,266 --> 02:11:16,266
They were

2246
02:11:16,333 --> 02:11:20,066
scheduled to be held in the spring of 2024.

2247
02:11:20,900 --> 02:11:25,500
Due to martial law under the Constitution, you cannot do this.

2248
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,200
These...these are presidential elections.

2249
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:31,066
The parliamentary elections

2250
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:38,600
did not take place in the fall of 2024, according to the Constitution.

2251
02:11:39,300 --> 02:11:41,466
Yes, there are security things, there is the

2252
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:43,700
Constitution, but there are security things.

2253
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:46,800
That is, everyone in Ukraine understands that

2254
02:11:46,800 --> 02:11:49,266
this cannot be done until the war is over,

2255
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:51,700
or legislation needs to be changed.

2256
02:11:51,966 --> 02:11:55,066
I believe that elections will take place immediately

2257
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:58,700
after the end of martial law - this is according to the law.

2258
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:02,000
Or members of the parliament need to get together

2259
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:04,966
and change legislation, which will be...

2260
02:12:05,266 --> 02:12:08,800
will be very difficult to do because society is against it.

2261
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:10,600
Why is society against?

2262
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:15,466
It is understandable why

2263
02:12:15,966 --> 02:12:17,700
because we want elections

2264
02:12:18,500 --> 02:12:19,800
that we want to trust.

2265
02:12:21,700 --> 02:12:24,366
8.5 million people went abroad.

2266
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:29,900
The infrastructure needs to be created for these millions of people to vote.

2267
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:33,866
Millions of people in the occupied territories.

2268
02:12:34,166 --> 02:12:37,200
I am not even talking about the occupation of 2014.

2269
02:12:37,900 --> 02:12:39,900
I am talking about the occupation right now.

2270
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:42,866
What to do with these people?

2271
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,100
This is a difficult question.

2272
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:49,800
And one of the most unfair ones is how to vote,

2273
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,700
without having a million soldiers.

2274
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:57,266
That is, it is impossible.

2275
02:12:57,466 --> 02:12:58,766
We need to think about

2276
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:03,300
how to change the system, if the elections are held in times of war,

2277
02:13:03,366 --> 02:13:07,500
change the legislation, which should include changes to the voting system.

2278
02:13:08,266 --> 02:13:14,566
To think about online voting, everyone is afraid because of certain attacks,

2279
02:13:14,633 --> 02:13:17,166
like cyberattacks,

2280
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:20,300
and so on, but, we need to think about it.

2281
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,100
I really think that it's possible,

2282
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,466
that we can

2283
02:13:24,666 --> 02:13:26,766
end the war in 2025.

2284
02:13:28,033 --> 02:13:30,500
- In January. We've already agreed on it.

2285
02:13:30,566 --> 02:13:34,000
- I would very much like to. I would very much like to.

2286
02:13:34,066 --> 02:13:35,666
- After, after the war?

2287
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,900
- And immediately.

2288
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:38,900
Yes immediately.

2289
02:13:39,600 --> 02:13:42,500
In the year of the end of the war, it's a fact. Why?

2290
02:13:43,466 --> 02:13:45,900
Because when martial law ends, you can

2291
02:13:45,933 --> 02:13:49,100
immediately vote in parliament to hold elections.

2292
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:53,466
And then everyone, everyone will vote.

2293
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,466
Because there are no restrictive measures.

2294
02:13:56,500 --> 02:14:00,666
And after they vote, I think elections can be held in 90 days.

2295
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:03,266
Something, something like that.

2296
02:14:03,566 --> 02:14:08,000
Yes. And this means that immediately after the end of the war,

2297
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:10,600
elections may take place in 90 days.

2298
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,100
- Are you running

2299
02:14:13,166 --> 02:14:14,266
for re-election?

2300
02:14:14,300 --> 02:14:17,466
- Even I don't know, really. I don't know. I don't know.

2301
02:14:18,266 --> 02:14:20,066
It is a very difficult question.

2302
02:14:21,200 --> 02:14:27,733
It depends on how this war will finish. It depends on what people will want.

2303
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:31,700
Mostly, it depends

2304
02:14:32,766 --> 02:14:37,000
on people, first of all, and of course, my family.

2305
02:14:38,233 --> 02:14:45,633
We had no time to speak about it with, with my family and, and of course

2306
02:14:45,866 --> 02:14:49,033
didn't have a chance because we don't think about it now.

2307
02:14:49,066 --> 02:14:53,900
I mean, it's something, you know, there are a lot of some, not a lot of, but

2308
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:59,633
enough voices in Ukraine from politicians, opposition, and etc.

2309
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:02,733
about this. Yes.

2310
02:15:02,766 --> 02:15:07,266
But, but we don't think really seriously,

2311
02:15:07,533 --> 02:15:10,533
didn't think seriously with my family about it.

2312
02:15:10,566 --> 02:15:14,233
So, this is war. I mean, how to think about what will

2313
02:15:14,266 --> 02:15:17,800
be after? It's very difficult, really very difficult.

2314
02:15:18,566 --> 02:15:24,466
- If we look at the field of candidates, I just maybe you can give your opinion about

2315
02:15:24,466 --> 02:15:26,633
the set of ideas you see out there,

2316
02:15:26,666 --> 02:15:29,600
including your own, about the future of Ukraine.

2317
02:15:29,633 --> 02:15:33,766
As I understand, the candidates include Poroshenko,

2318
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:37,600
Zaluzhny, Arestovich, Budanov, Klitschko, and many others.

2319
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:40,600
This is the internet speaking to me, heh.

2320
02:15:40,866 --> 02:15:43,966
What do you think of the space of ideas that these candidates represent?

2321
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,233
- You know, I think it can be, there can be even a bigger number of candidates.

2322
02:15:48,233 --> 02:15:51,666
Yeah, I don't really know what will be.

2323
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:54,266
They have rights to participate if they want to.

2324
02:15:54,633 --> 02:15:57,533
Yes, if they really want to and can they,

2325
02:15:57,566 --> 02:16:00,400
they can go and do what they want, honestly.

2326
02:16:02,666 --> 02:16:07,800
Most important is what are they doing now, I think that all these people are famous

2327
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:10,366
Ukrainian people, and it's,

2328
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:15,033
and it's important for them to do everything they can today

2329
02:16:15,033 --> 02:16:17,466
not begin any election campaign.

2330
02:16:17,500 --> 02:16:21,033
I think this what can divide our people to have the

2331
02:16:21,066 --> 02:16:25,100
elections, you know, during the war, I mean, this make

2332
02:16:25,133 --> 02:16:28,433
steps, speak about elections a lot, you know, make

2333
02:16:28,466 --> 02:16:30,966
a big mess about it. I, I think this is not right.

2334
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:34,866
That's why I'm not agreeing with some of these people, but

2335
02:16:36,133 --> 02:16:39,799
they, they can, and they, I, I think that they can, and

2336
02:16:39,799 --> 02:16:43,700
maybe some of them will, and it's okay. It's normal.

2337
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,333
It's very normal. Our system differs from the system in the United States.

2338
02:16:48,366 --> 02:16:52,000
You have two parties, and the parties decide who will be the leader.

2339
02:16:52,032 --> 02:16:55,665
And in Ukraine, everybody can participate. Let them.

2340
02:16:57,366 --> 02:16:59,366
- You think you're going to win the debate?

2341
02:17:00,966 --> 02:17:06,933
You versus Zaluzhny, Poroshenko, Arestovich, and you decide to run.

2342
02:17:06,966 --> 02:17:08,900
Do you think you're going to win the debate?

2343
02:17:08,933 --> 02:17:10,700
Or you're again focused on the war.

2344
02:17:10,733 --> 02:17:13,866
- Oh, I'm really focusing on the war and... - I understand.

2345
02:17:13,900 --> 02:17:18,333
- I think, I, I think the most difficult...

2346
02:17:18,665 --> 02:17:24,066
debate is what will be brought to the table, and we spoke about it.

2347
02:17:24,100 --> 02:17:26,799
It will be during the war, how to finish the war.

2348
02:17:26,833 --> 02:17:32,700
I think that is my goal because it will be one of my most complicated debates.

2349
02:17:33,366 --> 02:17:39,200
And for any president who is in a war, of course, but I think this is my goal to win

2350
02:17:39,733 --> 02:17:44,500
those debates and the other things are not, not for today.

2351
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:47,665
- As I said, the dream I have is...

2352
02:17:48,866 --> 02:17:52,966
it's a historic opportunity to make peace, to make

2353
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:58,100
lasting peace. Soon. So I'm glad you're focused on that.

2354
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:03,700
Let me ask a question about, that a lot of people in the United States think about,

2355
02:18:05,066 --> 02:18:09,466
uh, and I care a lot about the future of Ukraine, is corruption.

2356
02:18:09,966 --> 02:18:13,900
This is something you have cared a lot about for a long time.

2357
02:18:14,165 --> 02:18:20,333
You won the presidency in 2019, in big part, your message of fighting corruption.

2358
02:18:20,665 --> 02:18:24,233
But there's a lot of accusations that during war,

2359
02:18:25,032 --> 02:18:30,665
I mentioned $9 trillion in the United States, war breeds corruption.

2360
02:18:31,466 --> 02:18:36,133
So can you speak to that, how you have been fighting corruption?

2361
02:18:36,333 --> 02:18:41,299
And can you respond to the accusations that has been corruption in Ukraine?

2362
02:18:41,766 --> 02:18:43,933
You know, it's very simple. First of all,

2363
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:49,165
we really have a very sophisticated anti-corruption system.

2364
02:18:49,165 --> 02:18:51,466
Sophisticated not in the sense that it's difficult to

2365
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:55,200
understand, but in that it really consists of many elements.

2366
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:58,566
It's the most sophisticated in all of Europe.

2367
02:18:59,133 --> 02:19:02,066
This is another requirement of the European Union.

2368
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:08,700
It was a requirement for Ukraine, and for many years, Ukraine was not trusted.

2369
02:19:08,733 --> 02:19:11,500
I want to tell you that under me, we all voted for

2370
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:13,966
bills, all the...

2371
02:19:14,200 --> 02:19:18,866
anti-corruption reforms, all, well, almost all reforms, and

2372
02:19:19,299 --> 02:19:23,733
all anti-corruption bodies today are independent, they work.

2373
02:19:24,299 --> 02:19:29,600
As requested. I still believe that they are not perfect yet, there are many issues.

2374
02:19:29,633 --> 02:19:33,933
There is a judicial system, but also a judicial reform that our

2375
02:19:33,933 --> 02:19:37,900
partners — the United States plus the EU — demanded from us.

2376
02:19:38,500 --> 02:19:41,799
This is all written out. This is written out in specific

2377
02:19:41,833 --> 02:19:45,966
laws, in specific decrees, in specific decisions.

2378
02:19:45,966 --> 02:19:47,000
We did this.

2379
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:51,600
We've done 99% of this. If something has not

2380
02:19:51,600 --> 02:19:54,300
been done, it means that it is on the way.

2381
02:19:54,300 --> 02:19:56,566
But, in principle, all this exists, and

2382
02:19:56,600 --> 02:19:58,866
there is no such system as we have in Europe.

2383
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:01,933
To say that we do not have corruption

2384
02:20:02,066 --> 02:20:05,433
would be lying. We just talk about it openly.

2385
02:20:05,500 --> 02:20:07,800
We are genuinely fighting against it.

2386
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:17,000
Look, we have sitting in our prison Ihor Kolomoyskyi, who is the most influential

2387
02:20:17,133 --> 02:20:22,833
Ukrainian oligarch since independence. And no one could do anything about him.

2388
02:20:22,866 --> 02:20:25,733
The United States of America wanted to have Kolomoisky,

2389
02:20:25,766 --> 02:20:29,533
and they went to great lengths because of money laundering, etc.

2390
02:20:29,533 --> 02:20:32,866
There are criminal cases in the United States,

2391
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:35,100
I think in Delaware, something like that.

2392
02:20:35,266 --> 02:20:39,733
Neither Europe could do anything about it. That is, we did a lot with oligarchs.

2393
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:43,700
Russian oligarchs, sanctions were imposed, they were

2394
02:20:43,733 --> 02:20:46,500
thrown out, some of them fled the state, but

2395
02:20:46,533 --> 02:20:49,266
they are all... they are all under sanctions.

2396
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:53,566
We exchanged some of them for our soldiers, such as

2397
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:56,900
Medvedchuk, to whose daughter Putin is godfather.

2398
02:20:57,866 --> 02:21:03,333
That is, we fought against the strongest influential oligarchs,

2399
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:10,300
which, uhm, are and were in Ukraine, and we eliminated a lot of corruption.

2400
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:14,766
Of course, corruption exists in everyday life, it exists, but

2401
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:19,633
institutionally, I am sure that Ukraine will overcome all this.

2402
02:21:19,666 --> 02:21:23,066
This takes a little time. I would say honestly that...

2403
02:21:24,500 --> 02:21:30,833
Listen, what we call corruption, and in some state of the world is called

2404
02:21:30,866 --> 02:21:36,033
lobbyism, but this does not mean that there is no corruption there.

2405
02:21:36,766 --> 02:21:41,500
Let's take the aid you mentioned. During the war.

2406
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:44,833
First of all, we have no money.

2407
02:21:46,133 --> 02:21:50,300
We have no money except for the war.

2408
02:21:51,266 --> 02:21:55,566
We received weapons from the United States of America, from Europe.

2409
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:59,266
If we take, for example, money from the United States of America.

2410
02:22:00,633 --> 02:22:02,966
During all this time of the war,

2411
02:22:03,533 --> 02:22:09,133
around 177 billion have been voted for or decided upon.

2412
02:22:10,233 --> 02:22:20,433
177 billion. Let's be honest. We have not received half of this money.

2413
02:22:20,633 --> 02:22:25,600
The second point, which is very important, just as an example, is it corruption?

2414
02:22:26,400 --> 02:22:27,800
The first question.

2415
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:31,100
Whose corruption? This is the second.

2416
02:22:31,966 --> 02:22:34,933
Here is just one small example for you.

2417
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:39,166
When the United States began to transfer us weapons,

2418
02:22:39,633 --> 02:22:43,866
it was American money, but American weapons.

2419
02:22:43,900 --> 02:22:45,933
Money for these weapons.

2420
02:22:47,033 --> 02:22:48,266
I had...

2421
02:22:48,633 --> 02:22:52,033
as a president, I had cargo jets.

2422
02:22:52,566 --> 02:22:56,500
Not in Ukraine, because of the war, we moved them very quickly to Europe.

2423
02:22:56,900 --> 02:23:00,766
We had cargo. We have good cargo fleet.

2424
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:07,066
Very good, of, because of Antonov. So I asked...

2425
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:14,966
American side to grant me the opportunity, because our jets are at

2426
02:23:15,366 --> 02:23:22,933
another, yeah, airfield and I asked America to give me the opportunity

2427
02:23:23,433 --> 02:23:28,333
to use our jets for transfer. Not to pay a lot.

2428
02:23:28,800 --> 02:23:32,466
To whom? To your companies. To American companies.

2429
02:23:32,566 --> 02:23:35,033
No, I didn't get this opportunity.

2430
02:23:36,233 --> 02:23:38,033
My jets stayed put

2431
02:23:38,766 --> 02:23:44,133
and the United States jets, cargo jets moved these weapons.

2432
02:23:44,833 --> 02:23:49,366
But everywhere you have to spend money. So...

2433
02:23:51,633 --> 02:23:58,400
We could get more weapons, but we have to pay for this very expensive fleet.

2434
02:23:59,033 --> 02:24:00,133
My question.

2435
02:24:01,233 --> 02:24:05,633
Is this corruption or not? Or lobbyism? What is it?

2436
02:24:05,766 --> 02:24:08,766
- You mean corruption on the part of the comp, the US companies?

2437
02:24:08,766 --> 02:24:11,266
- Yes, making such decisions. - Yes I got it.

2438
02:24:11,266 --> 02:24:15,266
- The lobbying for such decisions involves some companies that make these

2439
02:24:15,266 --> 02:24:19,633
decisions, but I can't be open about it and I couldn't speak loudly about it.

2440
02:24:19,633 --> 02:24:22,400
I didn't want, I didn't want nor did I intend to

2441
02:24:22,433 --> 02:24:25,066
cause any scandals to arise, because otherwise

2442
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:27,466
you can freeze the support. And that's it. - [Lex] Yeah.

2443
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:31,533
And that's why when we talk about corruption, we must ask, who is involved?

2444
02:24:33,066 --> 02:24:37,233
If we had 177 and if we get the half, where is the half?

2445
02:24:40,766 --> 02:24:44,800
If you will find the second half you will find corruption.

2446
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:47,733
- There is a perception of corruption.

2447
02:24:47,733 --> 02:24:53,833
People like Donald Trump and Elon Musk really care, uh, about fighting corruption.

2448
02:24:54,733 --> 02:24:58,900
What can you say to them to gain their trust that the money is

2449
02:24:58,933 --> 02:25:02,700
going towards this fight for freedom, towards the war effort?

2450
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:07,166
- In most cases, we did not receive money, we received weapons.

2451
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,266
And where we saw risks that something could be happening

2452
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:13,733
with weapons, we cracked down hard on everyone.

2453
02:25:13,766 --> 02:25:17,333
And believe me, this is not only about Ukraine.

2454
02:25:17,366 --> 02:25:21,600
Everywhere along the supply chain, there are some or other

2455
02:25:21,866 --> 02:25:26,600
people and companies who want to make money, they try to make money on the war.

2456
02:25:26,766 --> 02:25:28,633
We did not profit from the war.

2457
02:25:28,666 --> 02:25:32,900
If we caught someone, believe me, we cracked down hard on them.

2458
02:25:32,966 --> 02:25:38,800
and... and we did that, and we will continue to do so.

2459
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:40,533
Because to this day,

2460
02:25:41,033 --> 02:25:44,400
when someone says that Ukraine was selling weapons

2461
02:25:44,433 --> 02:25:48,533
— and, by the way, Russia was the one pushing this narrative —

2462
02:25:48,566 --> 02:25:51,500
we always responded: our soldiers

2463
02:25:51,533 --> 02:25:56,066
would kill such people with their own hands, without any trial.

2464
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:59,666
Do you honestly think anyone could steal weapons by the

2465
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:03,233
truckload when we ourselves don’t have enough on the front lines?

2466
02:26:03,266 --> 02:26:07,400
And yet, we have to provide proof to defend ourselves. Because when

2467
02:26:07,433 --> 02:26:12,300
there’s an abundance of such misinformation, distrust starts to grow.

2468
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:14,866
And you're right, people listen to various

2469
02:26:14,866 --> 02:26:18,200
media outlets, see this, and lose faith in you.

2470
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:24,166
In the end, you lose trust, and with it, you lose support.

2471
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:30,700
Therefore, believe me, we are fighting more against disinformation than against

2472
02:26:30,733 --> 02:26:33,366
particular cases, although

2473
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:38,600
I still emphasize once again, at the everyday level such things

2474
02:26:38,633 --> 02:26:44,333
are still important. We catch these... these people, and we fight them.

2475
02:26:45,500 --> 02:26:49,366
- I mentioned Elon Musk: I would be interested to hear what you think of him,

2476
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:53,266
why you respect him as a person, as an engineer,

2477
02:26:53,300 --> 02:26:55,633
as an innovator, as a businessman.

2478
02:26:55,633 --> 02:26:59,666
I would just like to hear from you, what do you think about Elon Musk?

2479
02:27:00,100 --> 02:27:02,966
- First of all, I had a conversation with him at

2480
02:27:02,966 --> 02:27:06,566
the beginning of the war. I talked with him.

2481
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,500
I respect him, first and foremost,

2482
02:27:12,833 --> 02:27:14,833
I respect the self-made man, right?

2483
02:27:14,866 --> 02:27:17,700
In English, I love such people. You know... -[Lex] Yes.

2484
02:27:17,733 --> 02:27:21,200
No one, and nothing fell into their lap, but the man

2485
02:27:21,233 --> 02:27:25,300
did something, did it all himself. I worked myself

2486
02:27:25,800 --> 02:27:30,600
created a big production company, and I know what it means to make money,

2487
02:27:30,933 --> 02:27:33,566
to make money, to select talented people,

2488
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:39,166
to impart knowledge to them, to invest money and to create something.

2489
02:27:39,300 --> 02:27:42,866
Something important for certain people. You know.

2490
02:27:43,366 --> 02:27:46,500
And I am not, I'm not comparing myself to Musk.

2491
02:27:46,533 --> 02:27:51,866
He just, well, the man is a great leader

2492
02:27:51,900 --> 02:27:58,533
of innovations in the world. And I believe that such people move the world forward.

2493
02:27:59,866 --> 02:28:05,200
Therefore, I respect the result of his work.

2494
02:28:06,166 --> 02:28:07,800
And we see this result.

2495
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:11,066
And for me it has always been important that your

2496
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:16,133
result can be used, that these are not words, but facts.

2497
02:28:16,700 --> 02:28:21,966
Let's take the war. Uhm, We are very grateful for Starlink.

2498
02:28:22,633 --> 02:28:23,700
It has helped.

2499
02:28:24,166 --> 02:28:29,000
We used it after Russian missile attacks on the energy infrastructure,

2500
02:28:29,033 --> 02:28:32,366
there were problems with the Internet, etc., with connection.

2501
02:28:32,566 --> 02:28:36,533
We used Starlink both at the front and in kindergartens.

2502
02:28:36,533 --> 02:28:39,266
It was used in schools, it helped children.

2503
02:28:39,733 --> 02:28:44,100
We used it in various infrastructure. And it helped us very much.

2504
02:28:46,100 --> 02:28:52,233
And I would very much like Elon to be on our side

2505
02:28:52,266 --> 02:28:56,433
as much as possible, to... to support us.

2506
02:28:56,866 --> 02:29:00,400
And yes I am grateful to him for Starlink, truly I am.

2507
02:29:00,433 --> 02:29:06,533
First of all, so that our guys have a connection, and children, too.

2508
02:29:08,166 --> 02:29:14,200
And I am really... I am really grateful to him for that. I think we need...

2509
02:29:14,366 --> 02:29:16,933
I would like him to come to Ukraine, to talk

2510
02:29:16,966 --> 02:29:21,433
to people here, and to look around and so on.

2511
02:29:21,466 --> 02:29:23,433
- Has Elon visited Kyiv or Ukraine yet?

2512
02:29:23,466 --> 02:29:24,466
- No.

2513
02:29:24,966 --> 02:29:27,100
- I hope the Kyiv airport will open soon.

2514
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:30,233
Then it will... it will be easier to fly in.

2515
02:29:30,266 --> 02:29:33,866
- Yes, I am... I am looking forward to it.

2516
02:29:33,900 --> 02:29:38,100
Maybe we will open it, but only, and you must understand, if the war is over.

2517
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:42,800
There must be sustainable peace and air defense systems, to be honest.

2518
02:29:43,066 --> 02:29:46,200
And we must ensure that they are long lasting and effective.

2519
02:29:46,366 --> 02:29:51,700
Let's take the airport, for example, and let's focus on the airport in Rzeszów,

2520
02:29:52,033 --> 02:29:57,400
which you know very well, as it is handling important cargo for Ukraine in Poland.

2521
02:29:57,433 --> 02:29:59,733
And there are patriot systems there, because

2522
02:29:59,766 --> 02:30:03,300
everyone understands what the risk is. Well, Russia is a risk,

2523
02:30:03,333 --> 02:30:06,133
and therefore we need air defense systems.

2524
02:30:06,166 --> 02:30:09,866
And today, today take, for example, the air defense system…

2525
02:30:11,033 --> 02:30:13,500
of one city or another that is being shelled,

2526
02:30:13,533 --> 02:30:16,000
and move it, move it to the airport.

2527
02:30:16,133 --> 02:30:20,966
Well, that would be dishonest. People are more important than planes.

2528
02:30:22,433 --> 02:30:27,833
But there will be a moment, and Trump, by the way, I think that the war will end,

2529
02:30:27,866 --> 02:30:33,200
and President Trump may be the first leader to travel here by airplane.

2530
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:36,433
I think it would be, it would be symbolic, by airplane.

2531
02:30:36,500 --> 02:30:39,133
- Again, January 25th, around that date, right?

2532
02:30:39,166 --> 02:30:41,266
Flying in, meeting the Air Force One.

2533
02:30:41,300 --> 02:30:43,666
- Oh that would be cool. - Elon Musk.

2534
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:46,433
I will meet you there for the second time too, on the plane.

2535
02:30:46,466 --> 02:30:47,400
- With pleasure.

2536
02:30:47,866 --> 02:30:52,133
- And you, by the way, before I forget. Let me ask,

2537
02:30:52,566 --> 02:30:57,566
are you coming on January 20th for President Trump's inauguration?

2538
02:30:58,066 --> 02:31:00,000
- I would like to, of course,

2539
02:31:02,300 --> 02:31:07,333
I will be considering what is happening then in the war, because

2540
02:31:07,366 --> 02:31:12,366
there are moments of difficulties, escalation, many missiles, etc.,

2541
02:31:13,166 --> 02:31:15,766
but honestly, well, I can't

2542
02:31:16,433 --> 02:31:18,933
I can't come, especially during the war,

2543
02:31:18,966 --> 02:31:22,700
unless President Trump invites me personally.

2544
02:31:23,133 --> 02:31:27,566
I'm not sure it's proper to come, because I know that in general leaders are

2545
02:31:27,733 --> 02:31:31,866
for some reason not usually invited to the inauguration

2546
02:31:31,933 --> 02:31:36,733
of the presidents of the United States of America.

2547
02:31:37,566 --> 02:31:41,200
Well and I know that there are leaders who can simply

2548
02:31:41,233 --> 02:31:46,000
come, want to come, and will come. Yeah I know.

2549
02:31:47,033 --> 02:31:53,633
And I know the temperament of some of these people, they can come at their discretion.

2550
02:31:53,733 --> 02:31:57,566
This is very, very difficult for me. I am the kind

2551
02:31:57,600 --> 02:32:01,600
of person that cannot come without an invitation.

2552
02:32:02,133 --> 02:32:04,766
This is Putin, we did not invite him, he came

2553
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:09,266
to us, so to say. And me? I can't do that.

2554
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:11,666
- No, but didn't he publically say that it would

2555
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:13,766
be great if you came to the inauguration?

2556
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:16,333
Or, you mean, did he invited officially... - No, wait,

2557
02:32:16,333 --> 02:32:17,600
look, look, look, well...

2558
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:21,433
Listen I am against any bureaucracy, I get rid of it

2559
02:32:21,666 --> 02:32:23,900
as, as much as I can, but...

2560
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:32,400
Well, you know, there are some complexities involving security. I decide and I fly.

2561
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:35,466
And the United States of America officially

2562
02:32:35,466 --> 02:32:39,200
provides security... Not that I need this, mind you.

2563
02:32:39,233 --> 02:32:41,500
I do not ask for helicopters to fly around and

2564
02:32:41,533 --> 02:32:44,500
protect me. But they will simply do it themselves.

2565
02:32:44,500 --> 02:32:45,866
The Security Service itself.

2566
02:32:45,900 --> 02:32:47,866
They had to do it. I don't want it.

2567
02:32:47,866 --> 02:32:51,400
And sometimes I don't need it. And I'm asking them.

2568
02:32:51,433 --> 02:32:54,266
It was, for example, before the war.

2569
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:57,866
it, I think, yes, it was before, before the war. I just,

2570
02:32:57,900 --> 02:33:00,866
I just, I had a meeting, yes, with President Trump.

2571
02:33:01,133 --> 02:33:02,766
It was in 2019.

2572
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:05,533
I just wanted, just wanted to go for a run early

2573
02:33:05,533 --> 02:33:07,766
in the morning because I really wanted to exercise.

2574
02:33:08,166 --> 02:33:13,266
And they, those tall bodyguards, a lot of them, they decided to join me.

2575
02:33:13,533 --> 02:33:15,900
But I couldn't really do it because they were in

2576
02:33:15,933 --> 02:33:19,900
suits and I was in sportswear. I said, no, I can't.

2577
02:33:19,933 --> 02:33:23,666
It's always funny. I'm not, I don't want to, you know,

2578
02:33:24,100 --> 02:33:28,700
I don't want to disturb anybody and cause anyone problems with me.

2579
02:33:28,733 --> 02:33:32,333
And that's, that's why, if he, if he will invite me

2580
02:33:33,600 --> 02:33:34,666
I will come.

2581
02:33:34,966 --> 02:33:36,766
- I thought he invited you.

2582
02:33:36,833 --> 02:33:37,466
- Yeah?

2583
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:40,933
- Yeah. I thought he publicly invited you, but okay. I hope to see you there.

2584
02:33:40,966 --> 02:33:42,858
- I think they had to. I mean...

2585
02:33:42,883 --> 02:33:45,725
- Okay, alright. - ...to do some of their steps, I don't know, but...

2586
02:33:46,400 --> 02:33:49,200
- Step... the stamp was missing.

2587
02:33:49,266 --> 02:33:52,500
- Yeah, but with pleasure with my wife, of course,

2588
02:33:52,500 --> 02:33:55,300
and I think it's important. It's important.

2589
02:33:55,833 --> 02:33:58,066
- Alright, let's get back to a serious question...

2590
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:02,433
Sometimes they say it in America, this question of who is really in power.

2591
02:34:02,500 --> 02:34:06,033
So, let me ask, is someone controlling you?

2592
02:34:06,766 --> 02:34:10,400
For example, oligarchs, American politicians.

2593
02:34:11,166 --> 02:34:12,566
Yermak?

2594
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:14,633
(Ha-ha-ha-ha!)

2595
02:34:14,633 --> 02:34:17,300
I wanted to bringing this up, because

2596
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:25,533
I have been here in Ukraine... since the... twice since the invasion of 2022.

2597
02:34:25,600 --> 02:34:30,733
And one of the things I've learned well is that... actually nobody controls you.

2598
02:34:30,733 --> 02:34:35,833
And... this is... this is one of your strengths as president, as a person,

2599
02:34:36,400 --> 02:34:41,466
that oligarchs and other rich and powerful people like that,

2600
02:34:41,533 --> 02:34:44,633
cannot control you. Can you explain why that is, how you see it?

2601
02:34:44,666 --> 02:34:52,100
- I think, and it is indeed true, that I am generally difficult to deal with.

2602
02:34:52,900 --> 02:34:56,100
I am an ambitious person.

2603
02:34:57,066 --> 02:35:02,433
I can't submit to anyone. I can live by rules, by laws.

2604
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:09,666
I believe that this is the only thing that can control any person today.

2605
02:35:09,766 --> 02:35:15,666
These are the rules and laws of the society or state where you live.

2606
02:35:16,566 --> 02:35:19,533
And I believe that this is the most important

2607
02:35:19,566 --> 02:35:22,600
thing. There is no person who could control me.

2608
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:26,366
As I once told President Trump, when we had a meeting,

2609
02:35:26,566 --> 02:35:30,966
by the way, journalists asked if Trump influenced me

2610
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:34,666
during the phone call. I told him, I told the journalists

2611
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:38,200
the truth then, who can influence me — only my...

2612
02:35:38,233 --> 02:35:41,966
my boy, my son. This is a fact. When he calls

2613
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,933
asking for something, well, then I lift up my arms.

2614
02:35:44,933 --> 02:35:48,000
Yes, and I cannot do anything about it, because

2615
02:35:48,033 --> 02:35:51,066
children are children, I have so little time with them, and

2616
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:53,366
therefore when there are these moments,

2617
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:56,800
they are precious and important to me, I am ready to do anything.

2618
02:35:58,366 --> 02:36:03,300
Also, probably, my parents, they are an authority for me.

2619
02:36:04,266 --> 02:36:11,066
Beyond that, I view it more as a system. No one can control the President.

2620
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:16,333
Therefore, we have oligarchs who either fled or are in prison because

2621
02:36:16,366 --> 02:36:21,500
oligarchs usually control cash flows and people, and influence politics.

2622
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:25,166
And we have concrete examples with sentences.

2623
02:36:25,300 --> 02:36:27,333
They are not just under house arrest.

2624
02:36:27,366 --> 02:36:30,300
Not just that there are some judgments under which

2625
02:36:30,333 --> 02:36:33,333
their assets were frozen or sanctions were imposed.

2626
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:35,966
There are specific people who are behind bars.

2627
02:36:36,733 --> 02:36:39,200
I think this is the answer regarding the influence.

2628
02:36:39,266 --> 02:36:43,800
Would they like to influence me in the same way as any president of Ukraine

2629
02:36:43,866 --> 02:36:48,666
because finance and cash flows always influence politics?

2630
02:36:48,933 --> 02:36:52,733
Well, at least, they want to do this.

2631
02:36:53,900 --> 02:36:59,666
This is regarding the influence. And other people on the vertical, they

2632
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:08,033
perform tasks as my... my managers. Andrii you mentioned is one of those

2633
02:37:08,300 --> 02:37:15,300
managers, well, I am glad that I have such people.

2634
02:37:15,533 --> 02:37:19,333
Well, probably, there is nothing else to add here.

2635
02:37:19,633 --> 02:37:22,166
- I will just say that your team that I spoke with

2636
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:25,133
is an excellent team, excellent people.

2637
02:37:25,166 --> 02:37:25,933
- Thank you.

2638
02:37:25,966 --> 02:37:28,900
Okay, one last question. The future of Ukraine.

2639
02:37:29,433 --> 02:37:32,066
If you look 5, 10, 20 years into the future.

2640
02:37:32,233 --> 02:37:35,033
What can help Ukraine flourish economically,

2641
02:37:35,066 --> 02:37:37,400
culturally, politically in the future?

2642
02:37:37,700 --> 02:37:40,600
- Digital, it's very important.

2643
02:37:40,633 --> 02:37:43,766
Digitalization of all the process. We began this work.

2644
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:46,733
We have special Ministry of Digital Transformation.

2645
02:37:46,733 --> 02:37:47,974
- Ah yeah? - Yeah.

2646
02:37:47,999 --> 02:37:51,533
So, this is very good. And we also have our

2647
02:37:51,566 --> 02:37:55,133
Diia, this is the name for all of these services. Yeah.

2648
02:37:55,133 --> 02:37:59,600
So I think that is the most important. This is again,

2649
02:37:59,766 --> 02:38:03,166
this is not only convenient, that will cancel all the,

2650
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:08,633
any possibilities for future corruption because you don't have any, you know,

2651
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:12,333
you don't have any personal connections with people in the government or elsewhere.

2652
02:38:12,466 --> 02:38:15,933
So you are just on your phone or any other device.

2653
02:38:15,933 --> 02:38:18,500
That's it. And I think we are doing very well.

2654
02:38:18,733 --> 02:38:20,300
We are the best in Europe.

2655
02:38:20,366 --> 02:38:22,333
All of Europe recognizes it.

2656
02:38:22,366 --> 02:38:27,433
Some countries of the African Union asked us to provide this,

2657
02:38:27,633 --> 02:38:31,800
the same service, and we will do it after the war immediately.

2658
02:38:31,833 --> 02:38:35,233
And I think that we can bring money to Ukraine from this.

2659
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:39,000
And I think what we also need, we need a tax reform.

2660
02:38:39,166 --> 02:38:43,466
I think it will be very important for the businesses to return.

2661
02:38:43,800 --> 02:38:49,033
A lot of support will come, I think from USA business investment,

2662
02:38:49,233 --> 02:38:54,666
not as direct aid to us, just to the private sector and resources.

2663
02:38:54,933 --> 02:38:58,066
And I mentioned this to President Trump, and to some

2664
02:38:58,300 --> 02:39:01,833
European leaders who are our key strategic partners that...

2665
02:39:01,866 --> 02:39:05,233
we'll be happy, especially with the Americans, we'll be happy to

2666
02:39:05,266 --> 02:39:11,100
sign these contracts and engage in joint investments in many areas.

2667
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:15,066
And, and I think we can... We can develop

2668
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:17,833
oil, gas, green energy, including solar power.

2669
02:39:17,866 --> 02:39:21,966
And we already have the resources, we can invest money into this.

2670
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:29,100
We have oil reserves in the Black Sea, that we can, we can exploit. And we need your

2671
02:39:30,066 --> 02:39:33,233
expertise and the investment of your

2672
02:39:33,266 --> 02:39:37,200
companies, we have gold and uranium reserves,

2673
02:39:37,433 --> 02:39:40,966
the largest in Europe, by the way, which is also very important.

2674
02:39:41,066 --> 02:39:44,166
For example, Russia has pushed France out of

2675
02:39:44,200 --> 02:39:47,233
Africa. They urgently need uranium, which we have.

2676
02:39:47,266 --> 02:39:50,100
So we are ready to open up for investments.

2677
02:39:50,533 --> 02:39:57,266
- And this will give us, of course, opportunities, jobs for people, revenue.

2678
02:39:57,500 --> 02:39:59,700
I don't want cheap labor, honestly.

2679
02:39:59,766 --> 02:40:02,500
What I truly want, especially after the war,

2680
02:40:02,533 --> 02:40:04,900
to open up for those people who can really

2681
02:40:04,933 --> 02:40:08,833
contribute and earn. Yes.

2682
02:40:08,866 --> 02:40:11,566
- Yeah, give a reason to the 8 million people to come back.

2683
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:13,933
- Yes, it's so important.

2684
02:40:14,233 --> 02:40:19,100
And they will come and we will recover and rebuild Ukraine.

2685
02:40:19,133 --> 02:40:22,900
We will be very open to companies, and, of course,

2686
02:40:22,933 --> 02:40:26,233
we will welcome our people back. It's so important.

2687
02:40:26,566 --> 02:40:27,666
Culturally...

2688
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:33,200
I think the most important thing is to remain open and not change our direction.

2689
02:40:33,233 --> 02:40:35,766
Because culturally aligning with Russia,

2690
02:40:35,766 --> 02:40:39,100
it's one idea, while aligning with Europe is another.

2691
02:40:39,133 --> 02:40:41,066
Our people have chosen Europe.

2692
02:40:41,066 --> 02:40:43,300
It's their choice, it's our choice, the choice

2693
02:40:43,300 --> 02:40:45,700
of our nation, and I think it's very important.

2694
02:40:45,733 --> 02:40:47,366
- But first you have to end the war.

2695
02:40:47,400 --> 02:40:51,100
- Yes, you're right, and we will. We want peace, you know.

2696
02:40:51,566 --> 02:40:56,900
I mean, just to make it clear, we want peace, just what I always say.

2697
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,766
You have to come to Ukraine and see for yourself,

2698
02:40:59,800 --> 02:41:03,800
and people will tell you: "no, we can't forgive

2699
02:41:05,333 --> 02:41:12,433
those murderers who took our... our lives, but we still want to make peace".

2700
02:41:12,466 --> 02:41:16,566
And honestly, I think that the highest approval rating

2701
02:41:16,600 --> 02:41:21,000
of the president of the United States, of Trump, now...

2702
02:41:21,966 --> 02:41:23,300
is in Ukraine.

2703
02:41:24,666 --> 02:41:31,500
People really believe that he can truly help

2704
02:41:31,533 --> 02:41:36,933
bring peace. Now they have faith... faith.

2705
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:42,233
that he can make it happen. That he can support Ukraine and he can stop Putin.

2706
02:41:42,366 --> 02:41:46,866
And that he will make sure Putin doesn't get everything he wants.

2707
02:41:47,800 --> 02:41:51,333
This is very important and it's why we believe that we

2708
02:41:51,500 --> 02:41:53,733
must not lose this opportunity.

2709
02:41:53,933 --> 02:41:57,233
- I hope you find the path to peace. Thank you.

2710
02:41:57,266 --> 02:41:59,033
- Thank you so much. - Thank you for talking to me.

2711
02:41:59,058 --> 02:42:01,450
- Thank you for coming. - "Dyakyu" (trying to say “thank you” in Ukrainian)

2712
02:42:01,475 --> 02:42:02,475
- "Dyakyu" (saying “thank you” in Ukrainian)

2713
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:04,900
Yeah. You... you started.

2714
02:42:07,415 --> 02:42:08,482
Thank you very much.

2715
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:14,566
- Thank you for listening to this conversation with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr

2716
02:42:14,566 --> 02:42:15,700
Zelenskyy.

2717
02:42:15,700 --> 02:42:21,933
And now, let me answer some questions and try to reflect on and articulate some

2718
02:42:21,933 --> 02:42:23,100
things I've been thinking about.

2719
02:42:23,100 --> 02:42:29,866
If you would like to submit questions, including in audio and video form, go to lexfridman.com/ama

2720
02:42:29,866 --> 02:42:35,566
or to contact me for whatever other reason, go to lexfridman.com/contact

2721
02:42:35,566 --> 02:42:39,500
First, I got a bunch of questions about this.

2722
02:42:39,966 --> 02:42:45,666
So, let me chat about the topic of language and, let's say, the mechanics of multilingual

2723
02:42:45,666 --> 02:42:46,966
conversation.

2724
02:42:46,966 --> 02:42:49,900
Perhaps the details are interesting to some people.

2725
02:42:49,900 --> 02:42:55,566
It also allows me to reflect back on the puzzle of it in this episode and what I can

2726
02:42:55,566 --> 02:42:57,266
do better next time.

2727
02:42:57,266 --> 02:43:02,633
I already explained in the intro the symbolic, historic, and geopolitical complexity

2728
02:43:02,633 --> 02:43:07,200
of the choice of language in the conversation with President Zelenskyy.

2729
02:43:08,066 --> 02:43:12,400
As I said, the Russian language is one that the President speaks fluently and was his

2730
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:14,666
primary language for most of his life.

2731
02:43:14,666 --> 02:43:18,033
I speak Russian fluently as well.

2732
02:43:18,033 --> 02:43:21,300
It's the only common language we are both fluent in.

2733
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:26,333
So, any other combination of languages required an interpreter, including when I

2734
02:43:26,333 --> 02:43:27,500
spoke English.

2735
02:43:27,533 --> 02:43:30,500
He did need an interpreter when I spoke English.

2736
02:43:30,500 --> 02:43:36,200
And, just like I was, was visibly encumbered and annoyed by the process of

2737
02:43:36,200 --> 02:43:37,800
interpretation.

2738
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:42,700
This is why I tried to speak in Russian to the President instead of English, so that

2739
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:45,866
he can directly understand me without an interpreter.

2740
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:51,033
I'm willing to take the hit for that, as I am for everything else.

2741
02:43:51,033 --> 02:43:53,100
I'm not trying to protect myself.

2742
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:58,200
I'm trying to do whatever is best for the conversation, for understanding.

2743
02:43:58,200 --> 02:44:01,855
Though it has been getting harder and harder

2744
02:44:01,879 --> 02:44:05,533
to stay open, vulnerable, and raw in public.

2745
02:44:06,133 --> 02:44:12,733
While the swarms of chanting internet mobs stop by with their torches and their color-coded

2746
02:44:12,733 --> 02:44:16,433
hats, flags, frogs, pronouns, and hashtags.

2747
02:44:16,433 --> 02:44:22,766
Anyway, there is a lot of nuanced aspects of the conversational language that I would

2748
02:44:22,766 --> 02:44:24,700
like to explain here.

2749
02:44:24,700 --> 02:44:26,200
I'll try to be brief..

2750
02:44:26,933 --> 02:44:30,566
I can recommend a lot of books on this topic of language and communication that

2751
02:44:30,566 --> 02:44:33,400
reveal just how amazing this technology of language is.

2752
02:44:33,400 --> 02:44:38,866
For example, for a good overview, I recommend John McWhorter's books, and especially

2753
02:44:38,866 --> 02:44:42,912
his lecture series for the great courses on language. There are several.

2754
02:44:42,937 --> 02:44:49,066
In the Story of Human Language series, he gives a great discussion on spoken language

2755
02:44:49,066 --> 02:44:51,300
versus written language.

2756
02:44:51,300 --> 02:44:54,633
And that spoken language often relaxes the rules of communication.

2757
02:44:55,400 --> 02:45:01,300
It uses shorter packets of words, loads in a bunch of subtle cues and meanings, all

2758
02:45:01,325 --> 02:45:05,333
of which, like I'm trying to describe,

2759
02:45:05,358 --> 02:45:08,033
are lost when there's an interpreter in the loop.

2760
02:45:08,033 --> 02:45:15,300
Let me also describe some relevant characteristics of my "peculiar language abilities", in quotes.

2761
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:18,166
I was never good at speaking.

2762
02:45:18,166 --> 02:45:21,300
I listen, think, and understand better than I speak.

2763
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:26,000
For me, this is true for both English and Russian.

2764
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,500
But it is especially true for Russian.

2765
02:45:28,500 --> 02:45:34,266
The Russian language allows for much more room for wit, non-standard terms of phrase,

2766
02:45:34,266 --> 02:45:40,433
metaphors, humor, rhyme, musicality, and, let's say, deforming of words.

2767
02:45:40,433 --> 02:45:44,566
That create a lot of room for creativity in how meaning and emotion are conveyed.

2768
02:45:45,400 --> 02:45:47,933
You could do the same in English, but it's harder.

2769
02:45:47,933 --> 02:45:52,700
I actually find that Brits are sometimes very good at this.

2770
02:45:52,700 --> 02:45:55,933
Like, one of my favorite humans to talk to is Douglas Murray.

2771
02:45:55,933 --> 02:46:01,900
Setting the content of the conversation aside, the sheer linguistic brilliance and

2772
02:46:01,900 --> 02:46:05,533
wit of dialogue with Douglas is a journey in itself.

2773
02:46:06,733 --> 02:46:09,133
I think Christopher Hitchens had the same.

2774
02:46:09,133 --> 02:46:10,733
And many others.

2775
02:46:10,733 --> 02:46:12,900
Like I said, especially Brits.

2776
02:46:12,900 --> 02:46:17,433
Anyway, I'm able to detect and understand

2777
02:46:17,458 --> 02:46:20,766
a lot of dynamism and humor in the Russian language.

2778
02:46:20,766 --> 02:46:22,800
But I'm slow to generate it.

2779
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:25,000
In part because I just don't practice.

2780
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,500
I have very few Russian-speaking friends.

2781
02:46:27,500 --> 02:46:30,766
Funny enough, most of them are Ukrainian.

2782
02:46:31,266 --> 02:46:33,800
But they speak with me and each other in Russian.

2783
02:46:33,800 --> 02:46:38,400
But of course, as I mentioned, this is slowly changing due to the war.

2784
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:43,600
But I tried to speak to the President in Russian so he would avoid needing an

2785
02:46:43,600 --> 02:46:46,233
interpreter as much as possible.

2786
02:46:46,833 --> 02:46:51,400
One of the things I want to improve for next time is to make sure I get very good

2787
02:46:51,400 --> 02:46:53,300
equipment for interpretation.

2788
02:46:53,300 --> 02:46:58,966
And arrange for an interpreter I trust to be exceptionally good for the dynamism and

2789
02:46:58,966 --> 02:47:04,333
the endurance of a three-hour conversation in the style that I tried to do.

2790
02:47:04,333 --> 02:47:08,000
Just to give you some behind-the-scenes details of the experience.

2791
02:47:08,833 --> 02:47:14,200
So equipment-wise, funny enough, it's not actually so trivial to set up wireless

2792
02:47:14,200 --> 02:47:19,233
connections from us, the two people talking, to the interpreter, and then back to us.

2793
02:47:19,233 --> 02:47:23,266
In a way that's super robust and has clean audio.

2794
02:47:23,266 --> 02:47:28,500
The audio I had in my ear from the interpreter had a loud background noise.

2795
02:47:28,500 --> 02:47:35,400
So the whole time, I'm hearing a shh sound with the voice of the interpreter coming

2796
02:47:35,400 --> 02:47:37,366
in very quietly.

2797
02:47:38,133 --> 02:47:39,766
What a wonderful experience.

2798
02:47:39,766 --> 02:47:42,300
This whole life is, frankly.

2799
02:47:42,300 --> 02:47:47,100
Plus, his translation was often incomplete, at least for me.

2800
02:47:47,100 --> 02:47:50,900
So I had to put together those puzzle pieces continuously.

2801
02:47:50,900 --> 02:47:53,533
But again, it worked out.

2802
02:47:53,533 --> 02:47:58,266
And hopefully our constant switching of languages and having a meta-discussion about

2803
02:47:58,266 --> 02:48:03,100
language provided good insights as to the complexity of this fight for a nation's

2804
02:48:03,100 --> 02:48:06,400
identity and sovereignty that Ukraine is going through.

2805
02:48:06,933 --> 02:48:13,333
Behind the scenes, off mic, on a personal level, President Zelenskyy was funny,

2806
02:48:13,333 --> 02:48:16,966
thoughtful, and just a kind-hearted person.

2807
02:48:16,966 --> 02:48:19,966
And really, the whole team were just great people.

2808
02:48:19,966 --> 02:48:22,833
It was an experience I'll never forget.

2809
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:28,766
After the conversation was recorded, the next challenge was to translate all of this

2810
02:48:28,766 --> 02:48:31,033
and overdub it and do it super quickly.

2811
02:48:31,033 --> 02:48:37,333
Like, these words I'm speaking now have to be translated and dubbed into Ukrainian

2812
02:48:37,333 --> 02:48:38,566
and Russian.

2813
02:48:39,866 --> 02:48:44,600
Eleven Labs were really helpful here, especially in bringing the President's voice to

2814
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:46,233
life in different languages.

2815
02:48:46,233 --> 02:48:50,762
But even more than that, they're just an amazing team

2816
02:48:50,787 --> 02:48:53,133
who inspired me and everyone involved.

2817
02:48:53,833 --> 02:48:55,666
Please go support Eleven Labs.

2818
02:48:55,666 --> 02:48:58,866
They are a great company and great people.

2819
02:48:58,866 --> 02:49:03,339
The translation is separate from the text-to-speech

2820
02:49:03,363 --> 02:49:07,566
and was done in part by AI and a lot by human.

2821
02:49:08,233 --> 02:49:10,591
This is where the fact that we had constant switching

2822
02:49:10,615 --> 02:49:12,700
between three languages was a real challenge.

2823
02:49:12,700 --> 02:49:17,600
So there are six transition mappings that have to be done.

2824
02:49:17,600 --> 02:49:19,800
English to Ukrainian and Russian.

2825
02:49:19,800 --> 02:49:22,066
Ukrainian to English and Russian.

2826
02:49:22,066 --> 02:49:24,033
And then Russian to English and Ukrainian.

2827
02:49:24,033 --> 02:49:26,966
Continuously.

2828
02:49:26,966 --> 02:49:28,466
Sentence by sentence.

2829
02:49:28,466 --> 02:49:30,800
Sometimes word by word.

2830
02:49:30,800 --> 02:49:35,566
And each combination of language to language translation is best done by a person who

2831
02:49:35,566 --> 02:49:37,700
specializes in that kind of mapping.

2832
02:49:37,700 --> 02:49:40,433
So it was all a beautiful mess. All of it.

2833
02:49:40,433 --> 02:49:44,500
And on top of all that, great translation is super hard.

2834
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:46,888
For example, I've read and listened to

2835
02:49:46,912 --> 02:49:49,300
a lot of Dostoevsky in both English and Russian.

2836
02:49:49,300 --> 02:49:53,733
And studied the process of how these books are translated by various translators.

2837
02:49:53,733 --> 02:49:59,500
You can spend a week discussing how to translate a single important sentence well.

2838
02:50:00,300 --> 02:50:03,133
Obviously, in this situation, we don't have weeks.

2839
02:50:03,133 --> 02:50:05,700
We have hours for the whole thing.

2840
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:10,100
One of the things I regret is not putting enough time into the hiring and selecting

2841
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:11,266
great translators.

2842
02:50:11,266 --> 02:50:14,733
From Russian and Ukrainian to English, especially.

2843
02:50:14,733 --> 02:50:17,300
I think translation is an art.

2844
02:50:17,300 --> 02:50:23,000
So getting a good translator that works well with us is a process that needs more

2845
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,233
time and effort.

2846
02:50:24,233 --> 02:50:26,300
I'll be doing that more this month.

2847
02:50:27,100 --> 02:50:31,600
By the way, we have a small but amazing team.

2848
02:50:31,600 --> 02:50:35,166
If you want to join us, go to lexfridman.com/hiring

2849
02:50:35,166 --> 02:50:39,500
If you're passionate, work hard, and everyone on the team loves working with you,

2850
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:41,500
then we'll do some epic stuff together.

2851
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:43,000
We'd love to work with you.

2852
02:50:43,566 --> 02:50:48,200
Like I said about Eleven Labs, there are a few things as awesome in life

2853
02:50:48,200 --> 02:50:50,946
as being able to work hard with an amazing team towards

2854
02:50:50,970 --> 02:50:53,533
a mission all of us are passionate about.

2855
02:50:53,533 --> 02:50:58,033
Anyway, I'll probably be doing a few more interviews in the Russian language.

2856
02:50:58,033 --> 02:51:03,700
I do have a lingering goal of interviewing the mathematician Grigori Perelman, but

2857
02:51:03,700 --> 02:51:05,200
there's also others.

2858
02:51:05,700 --> 02:51:10,833
I will also work on improving my whole pipeline, both equipment-wise and interpreter-wise,

2859
02:51:10,833 --> 02:51:13,733
in doing these conversations in other languages.

2860
02:51:13,733 --> 02:51:18,366
Because there are many that I would like to do in languages I don't speak at all,

2861
02:51:18,366 --> 02:51:23,966
like Chinese, Mandarin, or Spanish, Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, French, German.

2862
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:29,800
I see language as both a barrier for communication and a portal into understanding

2863
02:51:29,800 --> 02:51:33,133
the spirit of a people connected by that language.

2864
02:51:33,133 --> 02:51:35,921
It's all a weird and beautiful puzzle,

2865
02:51:35,945 --> 02:51:38,733
and I'm just excited to get the chance to explore it.

2866
02:51:38,733 --> 02:51:43,566
All right, I got a question on how I prepare for podcasts.

2867
02:51:43,566 --> 02:51:48,300
So this has evolved and expanded more and more over time.

2868
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:51,900
There are some podcasts that I prepare hundreds of hours for.

2869
02:51:52,600 --> 02:51:57,866
In AI terms, let's say, first, I'm training a solid background model by consuming as

2870
02:51:57,866 --> 02:52:00,466
much variety on the topic as possible.

2871
02:52:00,466 --> 02:52:05,600
A lot of this comes down to picking high-signal sources, whether it's blogs, books,

2872
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:09,000
podcasts, YouTube videos, X-accounts, and so on.

2873
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:15,300
For this conversation with President Zelenskyy, for example, since February 2022,

2874
02:52:15,300 --> 02:52:18,066
I've spoken with hundreds of people on the ground.

2875
02:52:18,333 --> 02:52:27,533
I've read Kindle or audiobook - about 10 books fully, and then I skimmed about 20 more.

2876
02:52:27,533 --> 02:52:32,066
And I don't mean books about Zelenskyy, although he does appear in some of them.

2877
02:52:32,066 --> 02:52:35,104
I mean books where this conversation

2878
02:52:35,128 --> 02:52:38,166
was fully in the back of my mind as I'm reading the book.

2879
02:52:38,666 --> 02:52:43,100
So, for example, I read Red Famine by Anne Applebaum.

2880
02:52:43,100 --> 02:52:45,033
It's about Holodomor.

2881
02:52:45,033 --> 02:52:48,100
Does it directly relate to Zelenskyy?

2882
02:52:48,100 --> 02:52:49,700
Not on the surface, no.

2883
02:52:49,700 --> 02:52:54,700
But it sort of continues to weave the fabric of my understanding of a people, of a

2884
02:52:54,700 --> 02:52:55,933
history of the region.

2885
02:52:56,766 --> 02:53:01,700
But it's really important for me to read books from various perspectives.

2886
02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:07,533
And I'm always trying to calculate the bias under which the author operates, and

2887
02:53:07,533 --> 02:53:11,666
adjusting for that in my brain as I integrate the information.

2888
02:53:12,033 --> 02:53:15,529
For example, Anne Applebaum's book, Gulag,

2889
02:53:15,553 --> 02:53:19,766
is very different from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago.

2890
02:53:19,766 --> 02:53:24,000
The former is a rigorous, comprehensive historical account.

2891
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:30,666
The latter is a literary, psychological, and personal portrait of Soviet society.

2892
02:53:31,300 --> 02:53:33,900
Both, I think, are extremely valuable.

2893
02:53:33,900 --> 02:53:36,572
On the bias front, for example,

2894
02:53:36,597 --> 02:53:40,200
The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William Shirer is a good example.

2895
02:53:40,200 --> 02:53:41,533
It is full of bias.

2896
02:53:41,533 --> 02:53:47,066
But he was there, and to me, he has written probably one of the greatest, if not the

2897
02:53:47,066 --> 02:53:50,033
greatest, book on the Third Reich ever.

2898
02:53:50,033 --> 02:53:53,700
But like I said, it has a lot of inaccuracies and biases.

2899
02:53:53,700 --> 02:53:55,500
You can read about them online if you like.

2900
02:53:56,033 --> 02:54:00,700
But my job, in this case, and in all cases, is to adjust, based on my understanding

2901
02:54:00,700 --> 02:54:02,166
of the author's biases,

2902
02:54:02,166 --> 02:54:05,133
and take the wisdom from the text, where it can be found,

2903
02:54:05,133 --> 02:54:10,633
and putting the inaccuracies aside into the proverbial dustbins of history.

2904
02:54:10,633 --> 02:54:15,400
So as I'm reading, I'm writing down my thoughts as they come up,

2905
02:54:15,400 --> 02:54:18,433
always digging for some deeper insight about human nature.

2906
02:54:18,433 --> 02:54:22,466
If I'm at my computer, I'll write it down in Google Doc,

2907
02:54:23,300 --> 02:54:26,366
sometimes use Notion or Obsidian.

2908
02:54:26,366 --> 02:54:29,100
If I'm not on my computer, I'll use Google Keep.

2909
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:33,200
So, for example, if I'm listening to an audiobook, and I'm running along the river,

2910
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:37,500
if a good idea comes to mind, I'll stop, think for a few seconds,

2911
02:54:37,500 --> 02:54:41,800
and then do speech-to-text note in Google Keep.

2912
02:54:41,800 --> 02:54:45,700
By the way, listening to audiobook at 1x speed.

2913
02:54:45,700 --> 02:54:48,300
Old school.

2914
02:54:49,100 --> 02:54:53,600
And eventually, I get a gigantic pile of thoughts and notes that I look over to

2915
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:55,000
refresh my memory.

2916
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,700
But for the most part, I just throw them out.

2917
02:54:57,700 --> 02:55:00,533
It's a background model building process.

2918
02:55:00,533 --> 02:55:05,066
By the way, LLMs are increasingly becoming useful here for organization purposes,

2919
02:55:05,066 --> 02:55:08,766
but have not yet been useful, at least for me.

2920
02:55:08,866 --> 02:55:14,033
And I do try a lot for insight extraction or insight generation purposes.

2921
02:55:14,033 --> 02:55:20,700
I should mention that my memory for specific facts, names, dates, quotes is terrible.

2922
02:55:20,700 --> 02:55:23,466
What I remember well is high-level ideas.

2923
02:55:23,466 --> 02:55:26,500
That's just how my brain works, for better or for worse.

2924
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:32,966
I realize that sometimes forgetting all of the details and the words needed to

2925
02:55:32,966 --> 02:55:34,433
express them

2926
02:55:34,433 --> 02:55:38,166
makes me sound simplistic and even unprepared.

2927
02:55:38,166 --> 02:55:39,533
I'm not.

2928
02:55:39,533 --> 02:55:41,633
But that's life.

2929
02:55:41,633 --> 02:55:44,300
We have to accept our flaws and roll with them.

2930
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:48,900
Aside from books, I also listen to a lot of podcasts and YouTube videos

2931
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:50,433
where people are talking about the topic.

2932
02:55:51,033 --> 02:55:53,095
So for the President Zelenskyy episode,

2933
02:55:53,119 --> 02:55:55,700
I listened probably to hundreds of hours of content

2934
02:55:55,700 --> 02:55:59,166
from his supporters and from his critics from all sides.

2935
02:55:59,166 --> 02:56:03,700
Again, I choose who to listen to based not on their perspective,

2936
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:06,866
but based on SNR, signal-to-noise ratio.

2937
02:56:06,866 --> 02:56:11,933
If I'm regularly getting insights from a person, I will continue listening to them,

2938
02:56:11,933 --> 02:56:13,600
whether I agree or disagree.

2939
02:56:13,600 --> 02:56:16,566
In the end, this turns out to be a lot of hours of prep.

2940
02:56:16,566 --> 02:56:19,733
But to say that it's X hours per episode is not accurate

2941
02:56:19,733 --> 02:56:23,333
because a lot of this preparation transfers from one guest to another,

2942
02:56:23,333 --> 02:56:26,900
even when there's an insane level of variety in the guests.

2943
02:56:26,900 --> 02:56:29,033
We're all humans, after all.

2944
02:56:29,033 --> 02:56:32,412
There is a thread that connects all of it together,

2945
02:56:32,437 --> 02:56:34,666
somehow, if you look closely enough.

2946
02:56:34,666 --> 02:56:39,333
For more technical guests in STEM fields, I'll read papers.

2947
02:56:39,333 --> 02:56:40,933
A lot of papers.

2948
02:56:40,933 --> 02:56:44,333
And also technical blog posts and technical tweet threads.

2949
02:56:44,333 --> 02:56:46,500
This is a very different process.

2950
02:56:46,633 --> 02:56:51,100
For AI or CS-related topics, I will run other people's code.

2951
02:56:51,100 --> 02:56:53,133
I will write my own, implement stuff from scratch.

2952
02:56:53,133 --> 02:56:56,666
If it's a software company, I'll use their tools and software if relevant.

2953
02:56:56,666 --> 02:56:59,616
But in the actual conversation,

2954
02:56:59,641 --> 02:57:03,133
I constantly am searching for simple but profound insights

2955
02:57:03,133 --> 02:57:05,400
at various levels of abstraction.

2956
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:11,100
Sometimes this means asking a trivial question in hopes of uncovering the non-trivial,

2957
02:57:11,100 --> 02:57:15,800
counter intuitive but fundamental idea that opens the door to a whole new way of

2958
02:57:15,800 --> 02:57:16,933
looking at the field.

2959
02:57:16,933 --> 02:57:21,233
And actually, every guest is their own puzzle.

2960
02:57:21,233 --> 02:57:26,266
Like preparing for Rick Rubin was me listening to hundreds of songs he produced

2961
02:57:26,266 --> 02:57:30,500
and even learning some on guitar, like Hurt by Johnny Cash.

2962
02:57:30,500 --> 02:57:35,055
Preparing for the Cursor team episode meant,

2963
02:57:35,079 --> 02:57:39,633
obviously, I had to use Cursor fully for several weeks, all of its features.

2964
02:57:39,633 --> 02:57:42,600
So I switched completely for VS Code to Cursor.

2965
02:57:42,600 --> 02:57:50,433
For Paul Rosolie, round two especially, I literally went deep into the jungle with Paul

2966
02:57:50,433 --> 02:57:55,766
and almost died, fully taking the leap toward adventure with him.

2967
02:57:55,824 --> 02:57:58,628
When it gets close to the conversation,

2968
02:57:58,662 --> 02:58:01,466
I'll start working on the actual interview questions and notes.

2969
02:58:01,466 --> 02:58:06,366
And there I'm asking myself: What am I personally curious about?

2970
02:58:06,366 --> 02:58:09,433
Like, I love podcasts.

2971
02:58:09,433 --> 02:58:11,633
I'm a big fan of many, many podcasts.

2972
02:58:11,633 --> 02:58:16,366
And so I ask myself, what would I want this person to explain on a podcast?

2973
02:58:16,366 --> 02:58:22,675
And maybe what aspect of their thought process or their humanity would I want to be surfaced

2974
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:25,100
or have the chance to be surfaced?

2975
02:58:25,400 --> 02:58:30,933
In the actual conversation, I always try to put my ego aside completely and do

2976
02:58:30,933 --> 02:58:34,533
whatever it takes to have a good conversation and serve the listener.

2977
02:58:34,533 --> 02:58:40,833
This means asking questions simply, trying to define terms and give context if needed,

2978
02:58:40,833 --> 02:58:46,700
being open-minded, vulnerable, curious, and challenging the guests when needed.

2979
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:52,100
Despite the claims on the internet, I do ask a lot of challenging questions,

2980
02:58:52,100 --> 02:58:53,033
including follow-ups,

2981
02:58:53,033 --> 02:58:54,700
but always with empathy.

2982
02:58:54,700 --> 02:58:56,800
I don't need to be right.

2983
02:58:56,800 --> 02:59:01,400
I don't need to signal my moral or intellectual superiority to anyone.

2984
02:59:01,833 --> 02:59:04,033
I try to do the opposite, actually.

2985
02:59:04,033 --> 02:59:06,000
Because I want the guest to open up.

2986
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:10,433
And I trust the intelligence of the listener to see for themselves if the guest is

2987
02:59:10,433 --> 02:59:11,833
full of shit or not.

2988
02:59:11,833 --> 02:59:17,700
To detect the flaws and the strengths of how the guest thinks or who they are deep down.

2989
02:59:18,700 --> 02:59:23,866
A lot of times when interviewers grill the guest, it doesn't reveal much except give

2990
02:59:23,866 --> 02:59:27,800
a dopamine hit to the echo chambers who hate the guest.

2991
02:59:28,866 --> 02:59:31,976
As I said in the intro, I believe the line between good and evil

2992
02:59:32,001 --> 02:59:34,466
does run through the heart of every man.

2993
02:59:34,466 --> 02:59:37,866
The resulting conversations are sometimes a failure.

2994
02:59:37,866 --> 02:59:40,633
Sometimes because they are too short.

2995
02:59:40,633 --> 02:59:42,966
Sometimes because the chemistry was just not working.

2996
02:59:42,966 --> 02:59:45,233
Sometimes because I fucked it up.

2997
02:59:45,233 --> 02:59:48,100
I try to take risks.

2998
02:59:48,100 --> 02:59:49,533
Give it everything I got.

2999
02:59:49,533 --> 02:59:51,666
And enjoy the roller coaster of it all.

3000
02:59:51,666 --> 02:59:52,900
No matter what.

3001
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:57,233
And, as I said, I trust the listener to put it all together.

3002
02:59:57,866 --> 03:00:00,400
And I trust the critic to tear it apart.

3003
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:02,900
And I love you all for it.

3004
03:00:02,900 --> 03:00:07,700
Alright. I got a bit of a fun question.

3005
03:00:07,700 --> 03:00:11,466
It's a long one. So, Delyan. Cool name.

3006
03:00:11,466 --> 03:00:15,266
Wrote and said he spotted me out in the wild and had a question about it.

3007
03:00:15,266 --> 03:00:20,633
He wrote, I saw Lex working at the Detroit airport between flights.

3008
03:00:20,658 --> 03:00:24,250
I hesitated and ultimately decided not to interrupt

3009
03:00:24,275 --> 03:00:26,387
since he was in focus mode. True.

3010
03:00:26,933 --> 03:00:30,400
Lex had his headphones earbuds on, listening to brown noise.

3011
03:00:30,400 --> 03:00:33,300
Microsoft Surface propped up at eye level.

3012
03:00:33,300 --> 03:00:35,033
Kinesis Advantage keyboard on the table.

3013
03:00:35,033 --> 03:00:37,066
The use of Microsoft Windows is surprising.

3014
03:00:37,066 --> 03:00:40,300
But it has been discussed in the past. True.

3015
03:00:40,300 --> 03:00:44,108
The ergonomics of the setup, Surface at eye level,

3016
03:00:44,133 --> 03:00:46,533
means that Lex cares about his health.

3017
03:00:47,400 --> 03:00:50,901
But the anomalously large Kinesis Advantage keyboard

3018
03:00:50,926 --> 03:00:53,166
seems like such a burden to lug around airports.

3019
03:00:53,166 --> 03:00:54,700
I cannot help but ask.

3020
03:00:54,700 --> 03:00:58,966
Why is it that Lex is going through the hassle to bring this absolutely large

3021
03:00:58,966 --> 03:01:00,933
keyboard with him as carry-on?

3022
03:01:00,933 --> 03:01:02,766
It barely fits in a backpack.

3023
03:01:02,766 --> 03:01:07,200
Carrying it around must be necessary for Lex for some reason.

3024
03:01:07,200 --> 03:01:09,700
I love the puzzle of this, that you're trying to think through this.

3025
03:01:09,700 --> 03:01:14,833
The pain of lugging this tool around must be much smaller than the problem it solves for?

3026
03:01:14,833 --> 03:01:16,009
Question mark.

3027
03:01:16,133 --> 03:01:17,833
What problem does this keyboard solve?

3028
03:01:17,833 --> 03:01:20,800
What makes it necessary at the airport?

3029
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:23,116
Productivity? Health? RSI?

3030
03:01:24,249 --> 03:01:26,366
Good questions. Thank you, Delyan.

3031
03:01:26,366 --> 03:01:28,966
Great question. It made me smile.

3032
03:01:28,966 --> 03:01:31,666
So I thought I'd answer. I remember that day.

3033
03:01:31,666 --> 03:01:37,300
There was something else about that day aside from the keyboard that I miss.

3034
03:01:37,300 --> 03:01:44,466
So I am filled with a melancholy feeling that is appropriate for the holiday season.

3035
03:01:44,466 --> 03:01:47,766
So let me try to set the melancholy feeling aside.

3036
03:01:47,766 --> 03:01:51,800
And answer a question about my computer setup when I'm traveling.

3037
03:01:52,300 --> 03:01:56,321
So whether I'm going to SF, Boston, Austin, London,

3038
03:01:56,345 --> 03:02:00,366
or the front in Ukraine, I am always

3039
03:02:00,366 --> 03:02:02,550
bringing the Kinesis keyboard.

3040
03:02:02,883 --> 03:02:09,233
I don't have RSI or any other health issues of that kind that I'm aware of, even though

3041
03:02:09,233 --> 03:02:16,633
I've been programming, playing guitar, doing all kinds of combat sports my whole life,

3042
03:02:16,633 --> 03:02:21,833
all of which put my hands and fingers in a lot of precarious positions and situations.

3043
03:02:21,833 --> 03:02:27,066
For that reason, and in general, ergonomics have never been a big concern for me.

3044
03:02:27,066 --> 03:02:32,866
I can work on a crappy chair and table, sleep on the floor.

3045
03:02:32,866 --> 03:02:34,300
It's all great.

3046
03:02:34,300 --> 03:02:36,100
I'm happy with all of it.

3047
03:02:36,100 --> 03:02:37,966
So why Kinesis?

3048
03:02:37,966 --> 03:02:41,666
Which, by the way, is right here.

3049
03:02:45,533 --> 03:02:46,800
I had to think about it.

3050
03:02:46,800 --> 03:02:48,500
Your question actually made me reflect.

3051
03:02:48,500 --> 03:02:53,933
And I was hoping as I'm answering it, the truth will come out on many levels.

3052
03:02:53,933 --> 03:02:56,300
So it is true that I'm more productive with it.

3053
03:02:56,300 --> 03:03:01,733
I can type and correct mistakes very fast compared to a regular keyboard,

3054
03:03:01,733 --> 03:03:04,824
both in natural language typing and in programming.

3055
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:13,001
So fast enough, I think, where it feels like I can think freely without the physical

3056
03:03:13,026 --> 03:03:15,933
bottlenecks and constraints of fingers moving.

3057
03:03:15,933 --> 03:03:24,085
The bit rate in Neuralink parlance is high enough for me to not feel like there is

3058
03:03:24,110 --> 03:03:26,025
cognitive friction of any kind.

3059
03:03:26,333 --> 03:03:29,400
But the real answer may be the deeper, more honest answer or something else.

3060
03:03:29,400 --> 03:03:33,300
I've used the Kinesis keyboard for over 20 years.

3061
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:39,400
So maybe it's like one of those love stories where a guy and a girl love each other.

3062
03:03:39,400 --> 03:03:43,633
And you try to quit because it doesn't quite work.

3063
03:03:43,633 --> 03:03:45,733
But every time you leave, you ask yourself why.

3064
03:03:45,733 --> 03:03:52,733
And then you realize that when you're together, your life is just full of simple joys.

3065
03:03:53,333 --> 03:03:55,166
So what's the point of leaving?

3066
03:03:55,166 --> 03:04:00,200
What's the point of life if not to keep close to you the things that bring you joy, Delyan?

3067
03:04:00,200 --> 03:04:01,766
Like this keyboard.

3068
03:04:01,766 --> 03:04:03,433
It brings me joy.

3069
03:04:03,433 --> 03:04:06,133
It's a bad metaphor.

3070
03:04:06,133 --> 03:04:09,366
Over-anthropomorphized, perhaps.

3071
03:04:09,366 --> 03:04:11,266
But I never promised a good one.

3072
03:04:11,266 --> 03:04:13,566
I'm like a cheap motel on a road trip.

3073
03:04:13,566 --> 03:04:15,366
Low quality is part of the charm.

3074
03:04:15,366 --> 03:04:19,233
I do have some good motel stories for another time.

3075
03:04:19,233 --> 03:04:21,600
This does not feel like the appropriate time.

3076
03:04:22,533 --> 03:04:27,300
All that said, to disagree with myself, I did use eMacs also for over 20 years.

3077
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:31,300
And in a single week recently, switched to VS Code.

3078
03:04:31,300 --> 03:04:32,600
And then Cursor.

3079
03:04:32,600 --> 03:04:34,033
And never looked back.

3080
03:04:34,033 --> 03:04:37,400
So take my romantic nature with a grain of salt.

3081
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:40,600
So yes, eventually I'll have to leave.

3082
03:04:40,600 --> 03:04:45,000
But for now, you'll keep finding me on occasion in a random airport somewhere

3083
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:46,233
listening to brown noise,

3084
03:04:46,233 --> 03:04:49,333
writing away the hours on this Kinesis keyboard.

3085
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:56,400
If you see me without it, maybe it'll give you the same change of melancholy feeling

3086
03:04:56,400 --> 03:05:00,833
I feel now, in looking back to that airport in Detroit.

3087
03:05:02,966 --> 03:05:06,733
Anyway, more about my travel setup, if anyone is curious.

3088
03:05:06,733 --> 03:05:09,633
I usually do travel with a Windows laptop,

3089
03:05:09,633 --> 03:05:14,600
but I am mostly using Linux on it through WSL, Windows Subsystem for Linux.

3090
03:05:14,600 --> 03:05:18,833
And in some cases, I'm dual booting Linux and Windows.

3091
03:05:18,833 --> 03:05:21,133
I also need to be able to video edit.

3092
03:05:21,333 --> 03:05:26,766
So on longer trips, I usually have a bigger laptop with a bigger screen, lots of

3093
03:05:26,766 --> 03:05:28,433
memory, good CPU, good GPU.

3094
03:05:28,433 --> 03:05:32,366
All of that helps with video editing on Adobe Premiere.

3095
03:05:32,366 --> 03:05:35,688
In general, I'm extremely minimalist, except

3096
03:05:35,712 --> 03:05:39,500
for the few, let's call them sentimental things.

3097
03:05:40,466 --> 03:05:44,333
Like, all my podcast recording equipment fits into a small suitcase.

3098
03:05:44,333 --> 03:05:46,533
I try to keep it as simple as possible.

03:05:46,533 --> 03:05:47,800
Thank you for the question.

3100
03:05:47,800 --> 03:05:50,333
And see you at the next airport.

3101
03:05:50,333 --> 03:05:54,366
All right. I think it's time to bring things to a close.

3102
03:05:54,366 --> 03:05:58,049
I'd like to give a big thanks to you

3103
03:05:58,074 --> 03:06:01,033
for giving me your time and your support over the years.

3104
03:06:01,291 --> 03:06:02,524
It means the world.

3105
03:06:02,633 --> 03:06:06,566

3108
03:06:18,659 --> 03:06:21,073
I'll be traveling across the world a bunch this year,

3109
03:06:21,098 --> 03:06:23,175
from Europe to South America and more.

3110
03:06:23,200 --> 03:06:27,133
So it would be cool to do some small meet ups and meet some interesting people.

3111
03:06:27,816 --> 03:06:30,916
This has been a journey of a lifetime.

3112
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,200
Thank you for everything.

3113
03:06:33,723 --> 03:06:36,900
On to the next adventure. I love you all.
