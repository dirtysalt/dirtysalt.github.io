00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
- The following is a conversation with Pavel Durov,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,300
founder and CEO of Telegram,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,433
a messaging platform

4
00:00:07,433 --> 00:00:11,166
actively used by over 1 billion people.

5
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:14,833
Pavel has spent his life fighting for freedom of speech,

6
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,466
building tools that protect human communication

7
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:20,366
from surveillance and censorship.

8
00:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,500
For this, he has faced pressure

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,300
from some of the most powerful governments

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,733
and organizations on earth.

11
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,566
In the face of this immense pressure,

12
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:30,300
he has always held his ground

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,000
continuously fighting to protect user privacy

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,333
and the freedom of all of us humans

15
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:37,666
to communicate with each other.

16
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,033
I got the chance to spend a few weeks with him

17
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,700
and can definitively say

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,266
that he's one of the most principled

19
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,666
and fearless humans I've ever met.

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,833
Plus, when I posted that I'm hanging out with Pavel,

21
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,800
a lot of people, fans of his,

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,566
wrote to me asking if he does in fact privately live

23
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:59,800
the disciplined aesthetic life he's known for,

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,100
no alcohol, stoic mindset,

25
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,900
strict diet and exercise,

26
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,333
including a crazy amount of daily pull-ups and pushups,

27
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,900
no phone except to occasionally test Telegram features,

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,166
and so on.

29
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,400
Yes, he's 100% that guy,

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,900
which made the experience of hanging out with him

31
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,733
really inspiring to me.

32
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:20,933
I'm grateful for it,

33
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,566
and I'm grateful to now be able to call him a friend.

34
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:27,866
This podcast conversation is in parts philosophical

35
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,766
about freedom, life, human nature,

36
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:33,366
and the nature of government bureaucracies,

37
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:35,900
and it is also in part super technical,

38
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,133
because to me, it's fascinating

39
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,000
that Telegram has a relatively small engineering team

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,266
and yet is able to basically out-innovate

41
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,833
all of its competitors

42
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:50,833
with an insane rate of introducing new, unique features.

43
00:01:50,966 --> 00:01:54,500
Just like the meme of "The Simpsons" did it first,

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,033
you consider all the features we know and love

45
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,066
in our communication apps,

46
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:02,100
in almost every case, Telegram did it first.

47
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:04,333
So we discuss it all,

48
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,000
from the Kafkaesque situation

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,700
he's in the midst of in France,

50
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,032
to the rollercoaster of his life and career,

51
00:02:10,032 --> 00:02:12,466
to his philosophy on technology,

52
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,433
freedom, and the human condition.

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,633
And by the way, while this entire conversation

54
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:19,000
is in English,

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,100
we'll make captions and voiceover audio tracks

56
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,566
available in multiple languages,

57
00:02:24,566 --> 00:02:29,300
including Russian, Ukrainian, French, and Hindi.

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,400
On YouTube, you can switch between language audio tracks

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,800
by clicking the settings gear icon,

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,233
then clicking Audio track,

61
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:40,233
and then selecting the language you prefer.

62
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,400
Huge thank you once again to ElevenLabs

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,366
for their help with translation and dubbing

64
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:49,566
and with the bigger mission

65
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:52,500
of breaking down barriers that language creates.

66
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,933
They are truly one of the most remarkable companies

67
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,600
I've ever had the pleasure of working with.

68
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,733
This is the "Lex Fridman Podcast."

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,433
And now, dear friends, here's Pavel Durov.

72
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:11,533
- You've been an advocate for freedom for many years, writing that you should be ready

73
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:14,966
to risk everything for freedom. What were some

74
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,600
influences and insights that helped you arrive at this value of human freedom?

75
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,633
- I get to experience the difference between a society with freedom and a

76
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,566
society without freedom pretty early in life. I was four years old

77
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:33,600
when my family moved from the Soviet Union to

78
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:37,533
northern Italy, and I could see that a society without freedom

79
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:45,800
cannot enjoy the abundance of opinions, of ideas, of goods,

80
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,033
and services. Even for a four or five year old kid, it was

81
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:53,066
obvious. That you can't experience all the

82
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:58,066
toys, the ice cream of sorts, the cartoons

83
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,433
in the Soviet Union that you could access in Italy. And then I got to realize

84
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,166
something even more important. You don't get to contribute

85
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:14,200
to this abundance without freedom. And at this point, it was pretty obvious to me.

86
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,933
- You also wrote, "Svoboda vazhne deneg." It translates to:

87
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:24,633
"Freedom matters more than money." How do you prevent these values for freedom

88
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:29,733
corrupted by money, by people with influence, by people with power?

89
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:32,966
- Well, the biggest enemies of freedom are fear and

90
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:37,000
greed. So you make sure that they don't stand in your

91
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:40,600
way. If you imagine the worst thing that

92
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:44,500
can happen to you, and then make yourself be comfortable with

93
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:51,066
it, there's nothing more left to be afraid of. So you stand your ground,

94
00:04:51,933 --> 00:04:55,600
and you remember that it's worth living your life according

95
00:04:55,666 --> 00:05:02,266
to the principles that you believe in, even though this life can end up

96
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:07,933
being shorter than a longer life, but lived in slavery.

97
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:12,033
- Do you contemplate your mortality? Do you think about your death?

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,033
- Oh, yes.

99
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:14,600
- Are you afraid of it?

100
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:18,600
- In a way, you have to go against your instinct of

101
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:22,533
self-preservation. And it's not easy. We are all

102
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:27,833
biological beings hard-coded to be afraid of death. Nobody wants to die.

103
00:05:28,866 --> 00:05:32,533
But when you approach it rationally, you live and then you

104
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:36,333
die. There's no such thing as your death in your

105
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,366
life. You stop experiencing life once you die.

106
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,933
So you have to ask yourself this question, "Is it worth living a

107
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:47,966
life full of fear of death?" Or, it's

108
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:52,366
much more enjoyable to forget about this and live your life

109
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:58,166
in a way that makes you immune to this fear, at the same time

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,166
remembering that death exists so that every day would count.

111
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:08,166
- Yeah. Remembering that death exists makes you deeply feel

112
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,400
every moment that you do get.

113
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:15,366
- That's why I love reminding myself that I can die any day.

114
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:19,133
- In many ways you live a pretty stoic existence. I got a chance to

115
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:23,200
spend a couple of weeks with you. In many ways, you seek to

116
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:26,666
minimize the negative effects of the outside world on your

117
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,366
mind. You've written, quote,

118
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,666
"If you want to reach your full potential and maintain clarity of mind, stay

119
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:38,533
away from addictive substances. My success and health

120
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,633
are the result of 20 plus years of complete abstinence from

121
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:46,466
alcohol, tobacco, coffee, pills, and illegal

122
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:50,100
drugs. Short-term pleasure isn't worth your

123
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:53,933
future." Let's talk about each one of these. Alcohol.

124
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:57,766
What's been your philosophy behind that?

125
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:01,733
- That one is quite easy. When I was 11 years old, my

126
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:05,766
biochemistry teacher, he gave me this book he wrote, it

127
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,733
was called The Illusion of Paradise. In there, he

128
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:16,833
would describe the biological and chemical processes that happen in your

129
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:23,800
body once you consume this or that substance. It was mainly related to

130
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:28,166
illegal drugs, but alcohol was one of these addictive substances that he

131
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:36,100
covered. So it turns out that when you drink alcohol, the thing that happens is that

132
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:41,366
your brain cells become paralyzed. They become literally

133
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:49,966
zombies. And then next day, some time after the party is over, some of your brain

134
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,066
cells die and never get to normal. So think about

135
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:58,000
this. If your brain is this most valuable tool you have in your

136
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:03,733
journey to success and happiness, why would you destroy this tool for short-term

137
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:06,433
pleasure? This sounds ridiculous.

138
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,066
- In many ways, it's a poison we let in our body. But by way of

139
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,033
advice, what advice would you give to people who consider not drinking? You know, a

140
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,066
lot of people use alcohol to enable them to have a vibrant social

141
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,033
life. There's a lot of pressures from society,

142
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:27,733
you know, at a party to drink so they can

143
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:31,066
socialize. So, what advice would you give to them,

144
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:37,633
To people who imagine having a social life without alcohol?

145
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:41,732
- Well, first of all, don't be afraid to be contrarian. Set your own rules.

146
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,633
Secondly, if you feel you need to drink, there must

147
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:51,433
be some problem you're trying to conceal. There's something that, some

148
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:58,100
fear you're not ready to confront, and you have to address this fear.

149
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:02,866
If there is a good-looking girl you're afraid to approach,

150
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,000
get rid of this fear, approach her, practice, do it again and again. It's pretty

151
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:11,300
banal... but this advice works.

152
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:15,133
- Fix the underlying problem, which is usually at the very bottom is

153
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,566
always going to be fear. Work on that.

154
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,333
- I don't know. Very often, people are trying to escape something in their lives with

155
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:25,300
alcohol. What is it they're trying to escape? What is this

156
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:31,433
problem? You have to get to the bottom of it. Your mind is trying to tell you

157
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:38,033
something valuable, and instead of addressing it directly, you are

158
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:46,033
flooding it in alcohol, which is sort of a spiritual painkiller, but works

159
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:51,333
only temporarily, and then you have to pay the debt with interest.

160
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,233
- So, what do you do? I mean, you've been in a lot of gatherings, a lot of

161
00:09:54,266 --> 00:09:58,600
parties. Is there some challenges to saying no?

162
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:05,533
- For me, not at all. I've been always ready to stand my ground and say no when I feel

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,566
something's not right. And it's extraordinary how easily

164
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:18,833
we humans are affected by what we perceive as majority, because nobody since ancient

165
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:22,866
times, since millions of years ago, wants to be left

166
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:34,366
out by the tribe. We are scared that we won't become accepted anymore, which

167
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:37,833
thousands or millions of years ago meant we're going to starve to

168
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:46,133
death. So, we have to consciously fight this inclination

169
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:53,033
to be agreeable with everything that the majority imposes on you, because

170
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:56,200
it's quite clear that many things that the

171
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:59,766
majority... in many activities the majority is engaging in

172
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:02,933
are not bringing you any good.

173
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:06,233
- So, that's another fear you have to face. Going into a party and

174
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,100
the fear of being the outcast at that party, of being different than

175
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:15,066
others at that party, at that social gathering in the crowd

176
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,700
of humans, be different. That's a fear.

177
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:21,466
- That's a fear, and it's quite irrational if you think about it.

178
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:28,600
It was something that made a lot of sense 20,000 years ago.

179
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,100
It makes zero sense today, because if you think about it, if

180
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:36,100
you do the same thing everybody else around you is doing,

181
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:42,233
you don't have any competitive advantage, and you don't get to become outstanding

182
00:11:43,266 --> 00:11:45,066
at some point in your life.

183
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:48,100
- Yeah, that's one of the things we talked about

184
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,033
sort of by way of advice is, if you want to be successful in life, you want to be

185
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:53,833
different.

186
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:56,133
- Definitely.

187
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:59,733
- And perhaps, I think you said you want to achieve

188
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:03,233
mastery at a niche, so find a niche at which you can

189
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:06,866
pursue with all your effort and achieve mastery,

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,733
and the niche being different than anything that

191
00:12:10,766 --> 00:12:13,833
anybody else is doing. Can you explain that a little bit more?

192
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,166
- So, obviously, in order to contribute to the society

193
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,766
you're in, to the economy of the country you live

194
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:26,766
in, you have to do something that is valuable. But

195
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,133
if you're doing something that everybody else is doing anyway,

196
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:35,833
what's the value of it? Now, it sounds easier

197
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:39,266
than it is done to do something that nobody else is doing,

198
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:43,433
because we humans are surrounded by all kinds of information

199
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:46,833
which makes us want to copy what we are

200
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:50,800
perceiving. At the same time, there are so many areas which you can

201
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:54,466
explore that have nothing to do with the

202
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,566
information you receive on the daily basis. So, it's

203
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:01,933
extremely important to curate the information sources that you have,

204
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:08,700
so that you wouldn't be somebody who is left to

205
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:15,833
the will of AI-based algorithmic feed telling you what's

206
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:19,766
important, so that you end up consuming the same

207
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,233
information, the same stuff, the same memes, the same news as everybody

208
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:29,766
else. But rather, you should be proactive. You should deliberately try to

209
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:36,733
set a goal an area that you want to explore, and then actively search

210
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:42,866
information that is relevant to this field, so that one day,

211
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:47,466
you can become the world's number one

212
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,333
expert in this field. And it's not quite... it's not that

213
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,200
difficult to do that. You have to

214
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:59,100
just remain consistent, because nobody else is trying to do

215
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:03,033
that. Everybody else is just reading the same news and discussing the same

216
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:08,833
news every day. But this way, they don't get to have a competitive advantage.

217
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:12,566
- Yeah. The majority of the population become slaves to the

218
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:16,433
AI recommender systems, AI-driven recommender systems, and so the

219
00:14:16,466 --> 00:14:20,333
content everybody's fed is the same thing, and we all become the same.

220
00:14:20,366 --> 00:14:24,300
On that point, one of the different things you do is you

221
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:28,200
don't use a phone, except occasionally to test Telegram

222
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:31,833
features. But I've been with you for two weeks. I haven't seen you use a

223
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:35,533
phone at all in the way that most people use a phone, like, for their

224
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,966
social media. So, can you describe your philosophy behind that?

225
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:44,100
- I don't think a phone is a necessary device. I

226
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,533
remember growing up, I didn't have a mobile phone.

227
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:51,966
When I was a student at the university, I didn't have a mobile

228
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,833
phone. When I finally got to use a mobile phone, I

229
00:14:55,866 --> 00:15:03,600
never used phone calls. I was always in airplane mode or mute. I hated the

230
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:14,900
idea of being disturbed. My philosophy here is pretty simple. I want to define

231
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:21,700
what is important in my life. I don't want other

232
00:15:21,766 --> 00:15:29,400
people or companies, all kinds of organizations telling me what is

233
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:33,300
important today and what

234
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:37,333
I should be thinking about. Just set up your own agenda, and

235
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,066
the phone gets in your way.

236
00:15:40,066 --> 00:15:44,000
- It provides distractions. It guides what you

237
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:47,833
should be looking at, what you will be looking at, so you don't want that. You want to

238
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:54,933
quiet the mind. You want to choose what kind of stuff you let inside your mind.

239
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:57,166
- Yes, because this way I can contribute

240
00:15:57,966 --> 00:16:01,933
to the progress of society, or at least I like to think this way, and

241
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:03,300
this makes me happier.

242
00:16:03,366 --> 00:16:07,033
- How often do you find quiet time to just think and focus deeply on

243
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,166
work without any distractions? You mentioned to me that you value quiet mornings.

244
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:18,366
- Yes. So the thing I'm trying to do, I try to allocate as much time as possible

245
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,733
for sleep. Now, even if I allocate, say, 11 or

246
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:27,700
12 hours for sleep, I won't sleep for 11 or 12 hours.

247
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:31,466
So what I end up doing is I end up

248
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:35,433
lying in bed thinking, and some people hate it. They

249
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:39,166
say, "Oh, you have to take a sleeping pill," but I never take pills.

250
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,366
I love these moments. I get

251
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,166
so many brilliant ideas, or at least they seem brilliant to me at

252
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,166
the moment, while I'm lying in bed, either

253
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:56,166
late in the evening or early in the morning. That's my favorite time of the day.

254
00:16:56,233 --> 00:17:01,466
Sometimes I wake up, I go take a shower, still without the

255
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,366
phone. Beautiful ideas can come to you

256
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,366
while you're doing your morning exercise, your

257
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,000
morning routine, without a phone. If you open your phone first thing in the morning,

258
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:19,165
what you end up being is a creature that is

259
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,165
told what to think about for the rest of the day. Same is true in a way if

260
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,666
you've been consuming news from social media late at night.

261
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:35,866
But then how do you define what is important and

262
00:17:35,966 --> 00:17:39,866
what you really want to become in life? Now, I'm not saying

263
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,833
you have to completely stay away from all sources of

264
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:47,633
information, but take some time to think about what's really

265
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,433
important for you and what you want to change in this world.

266
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,333
- So you definitely try to avoid digital devices for as many hours as possible in the morning,

267
00:17:56,866 --> 00:18:00,300
just to have the quiet thinking time? Plus the crazy amounts of

268
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,266
push-ups and squats.

269
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:05,633
- I know it's kind of counterintuitive because

270
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,033
I founded one of the largest social networks in the world, after which I

271
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:14,000
founded the second-largest messaging app in the world, and

272
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:19,000
you're supposed to be really connected. But the

273
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:22,800
conclusion you reach very early is that the more connected and

274
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:26,333
accessible you are, the less productive you are.

275
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:32,400
And then how can you run this thing if you're constantly

276
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:38,966
bombarded by all kinds of information, most of which is irrelevant to the success

277
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,933
of what you're trying to build? You know, the entire world can be fascinated

278
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,266
by a fight, a quarrel between the world's richest man and

279
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,266
the world's most powerful man. But for the vast majority of these people

280
00:18:55,366 --> 00:19:01,866
following this saga, it's irrelevant. It won't change their lives.

281
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:08,033
And in any case, they can't affect it, so it's a bit pointless. Of course, there are

282
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:11,866
people who are engaged in activities

283
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:15,500
that require them to be up-to-date of everything that's going

284
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:19,566
on, but 99% of people aren't.

285
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:24,400
- Yeah. The internet, social media presents to us drama

286
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,000
in such a way that we think it's the biggest thing in the world, the most important thing in

287
00:19:30,066 --> 00:19:33,833
which the tides of history will turn when in reality, most things

288
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,866
will not turn the tides of history. And so, I guess our challenge

289
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,766
is to figure out what is the timeless thing? What is

290
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,066
the thing that's happening today that's still going to be true in 10, 20

291
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,800
years? And from that,

292
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:52,566
decide what you're going to do. And that's very difficult on social media

293
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,466
'cause everybody's outraged. The news of the day, whatever the quarrel is,

294
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,866
that's the thing that everyone thinks the world will end because

295
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,733
of this thing, and then another thing happens the next day.

296
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:07,766
- And they're trying to influence your emotions.

297
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:13,900
And that's how you get into trouble, because you can be forced to make conclusions

298
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:17,066
that are not in your best interest.

299
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,500
- I've seen you be, once again, quite stoic about your

300
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,900
emotions. Do you ever get angry? Do you ever get

301
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,366
lonely? You ever get sad? The rollercoaster of human

302
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:31,133
emotion. And what do you do with that? What do you make difficult decisions?

303
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,466
- I'm a human being like everybody else. I do get to experience

304
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,400
emotions, and some of them are not very pleasant. But I

305
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:42,700
believe that it's the responsibility of every one of us-

306
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:47,566
...to cope with these emotions and to learn to

307
00:20:48,366 --> 00:20:52,166
work through them. Self-discipline is particularly

308
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:57,100
important, because without it, how can you overcome

309
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:03,500
this seemingly endless loop of negativity or

310
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:09,566
despair that ultimately leads to depression for some people? I normally never

311
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:13,400
have depression. I don't remember having depression in the last 20

312
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:21,233
years at least, maybe when I was a teenager. But one of the reasons for that is, I

313
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:30,266
start doing things. I identify the problem, I can see a solution, and I start

314
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:39,033
executing the strategy. If you are stuck in this loop of

315
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:42,566
being worried about something, nothing's ever going to change.

316
00:21:43,566 --> 00:21:47,566
And people often make this mistake, thinking, "Oh, I should just

317
00:21:48,466 --> 00:21:52,300
have some rest and then regain energy." This is

318
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,866
not how it works. You gain energy by doing

319
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:59,766
something. So if you start doing something, then it happens. You

320
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:05,733
feel motivated, you feel inspired, and then ultimately you do

321
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:09,800
something else, a little bit more, a little bit more, and in a few years,

322
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,666
who knows, you may end up achieving great things.

323
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,300
- Yeah, that's the thing that people really confuse. If you're stuck

324
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:20,700
in a depressive cycle, even when you really,

325
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:23,966
really, really, really don't wanna do anything, just do

326
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:27,966
something. Try to make progress because the good feeling comes

327
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:31,800
in the end of that. The whole point is to do first and then feel, not feel and then do.

328
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:37,066
- Exactly. And going to the gym is a good example.

329
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,000
There are many days when you don't want to start working

330
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,466
out, but you have to overcome this initial reluctance, and

331
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:50,500
then you get to a point that you enjoy it, and you think,

332
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:54,200
"Oh my God, it was such a good idea to come to the gym today." But

333
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:00,200
it's similar to pretty much every activity. You get to write some

334
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:04,133
code, write a small piece of code first, and

335
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,966
then you get inspired. Then you come up with more

336
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:12,033
ideas. You need to write a novel or just write the program.

337
00:23:13,166 --> 00:23:15,500
This is pretty obvious, and

338
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,300
it's not a secret, but because we are bombarded with all kinds

339
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:25,933
of information that is not really important for us in terms of becoming

340
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:32,533
successful, we often forget the important things, and this is one of them.

341
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:38,366
- We've been working out every single day. You have been working out for many years

342
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:43,666
pretty intensively, so I think a lot of people would love to

343
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:46,766
know what's your perfect daily workout regimen,

344
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,300
let's say on a daily, on a weekly basis?

345
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,766
- I do 300 push-ups and 300 squats every morning, and in

346
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:58,633
addition to that, I go to the gym normally five or six

347
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,966
times a week, spending between one and two hours every day.

348
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:07,200
- So push-ups and squats are still a big part of your routine?

349
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:10,800
- Yes, this is how I start my day. I'm not sure they

350
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:16,633
do a lot in terms of changing your body, but they're definitely a good way to

351
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:19,300
practice self-discipline,

352
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:24,333
because you don't want to do these push-ups in the morning most of the days.

353
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:27,766
Squats are particularly boring. They're not that

354
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:35,033
hard. They're just boring. But you overcome it, and then it's much easier to

355
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:43,000
start doing other things related to your work, for example. When I

356
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:47,000
can, I also take an ice bath because it's another exercise of

357
00:24:47,033 --> 00:24:50,866
self-discipline. I think the main muscle you can exercise is this

358
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,833
muscle, the muscle of self-discipline. You know,

359
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:59,266
not your biceps or your pecs or anything else,

360
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:07,500
because if you get to train that one, everything else just comes by itself.

361
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:11,533
- Yeah, everything else becomes easy. We should mention, I went with you

362
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,133
to Banya, and I think it's fair to say you're nuts

363
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:21,366
in terms of how much you can handle, and I didn't

364
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,033
even see the worst of it. Can you just speak to your crazy escapades in the Banya,

365
00:25:25,533 --> 00:25:29,100
what value you get from it, so both the heat and the cold?

366
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:36,333
- I don't know if it's crazy. I think it's quite natural and normal by this time.

367
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:42,433
But maybe I just got used to it. So Banya is this extreme kind of

368
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:47,000
sauna practiced by Eastern Europeans.

369
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:55,766
But it is done in a way that maximizes heat, and they also

370
00:25:55,833 --> 00:26:01,566
use all kinds of herbs and branches, and it's a much more holistic and natural

371
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,133
experience. Then a necessary part of it is you get the cold

372
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,200
plunge, and then you go back. And

373
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:16,166
again, this is one of those things that maybe in the moment

374
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:20,200
is not always that pleasant, particularly if you go to extreme

375
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:24,700
temperatures. You don't feel great. I don't always

376
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:29,433
feel great, but this feeling is passing. It's only a few minutes.

377
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,900
Same with the ice bath. You have to suffer a bit,

378
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:40,866
and then you get to feel great for hours and days after.

379
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:46,600
What's more, it gives you these long-term health benefits. In a

380
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:50,466
way, you can look at it as alcohol in

381
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:54,366
reverse. Alcohol will give you this short, fleeting

382
00:26:54,666 --> 00:27:00,600
pleasure for an hour, for a couple of hours, but then you will be paying

383
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:09,033
for it with long-term negative consequences. I'd rather do Banya and ice bath.

384
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:13,033
- We swam the length of a large lake in France a couple times. Can you

385
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:17,366
talk through why you value these multi-hour swims?

386
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:25,100
- I love swimming for hours. The longest I swam was five and a half hours in

387
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,100
Finland, it was quite cold. I got lost in the process,

388
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,233
barely could find my way back. But

389
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:39,400
the reason I do it, yes, you feel great after. You're shaking a little

390
00:27:39,466 --> 00:27:43,033
bit, but you feel great after. We cross a huge lake, and I cross many

391
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:50,133
lakes, Geneva Lake, Zurich Lake. And every time, you feel this achievement

392
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:56,900
which makes you happy, makes you feel strong, and then you're

393
00:27:56,933 --> 00:28:04,633
more ready to other challenges. And of course, when you know you are going to start

394
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,300
a journey that will last a few hours, you're reluctant to do

395
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,966
it. But you swim for 10 minutes, and then for 20 minutes, and then for 30 minutes,

396
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:18,566
and it teaches you this incredible patience

397
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,833
that I think is necessary if you want to achieve anything in life.

398
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:27,500
- And it's pretty meditative, lake versus ocean.

399
00:28:27,566 --> 00:28:33,833
- Yes. And you don't have to go too fast. You can be slow and enjoy the moment.

400
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:37,733
- Until you get lost, and it's five and a half hours. Did you panic if you were

401
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,900
gonna be able to find the shore or find your way out?

402
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:46,100
- Not really. I'm a reasonably stress-resilient person. I didn't panic at that moment,

403
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:49,433
and there were worse swims I had that were shorter, but

404
00:28:50,266 --> 00:28:53,933
involved accidents, and you know about some of them. So

405
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,066
that wasn't the worst by far. But an important thing

406
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:05,733
about swimming and physical activity in general is that it makes your mind clear,

407
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:12,200
and your thinking process is becoming more efficient. Because at the end

408
00:29:12,233 --> 00:29:19,366
of the day, the efficiency of our brain is limited by how much sugar and oxygen our

409
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,666
heart can push through blood to our brain. So how can you make

410
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:29,233
this go faster, or how do you make your lungs more efficient? How do you make

411
00:29:30,533 --> 00:29:34,466
your heart more efficient in doing that? Physical activity is

412
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:40,033
the only way I know of. So it's not just staying healthy

413
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:52,200
or trying to look good. It's also being productive. It's also being

414
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,233
stress-resilient. All of these qualities

415
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,400
are necessary if you want to run a large company, if you want to start a company.

416
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,300
I'm surprised, when I started doing this

417
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:12,800
more than 10 years ago, that more CEOs didn't engage in sports.

418
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,033
The situation changed in the last several years, which is

419
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,666
great. Because back in the day, if you take 20 years ago, there was this stereotype

420
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,433
that if you were strong, you must be not very smart, and vice

421
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:34,300
versa, which is complete lunacy. Very often, these two things go together.

422
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:38,266
- So for you, working out is not just about staying healthy. It's actually valuable for the work that

423
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,300
you do as a tech leader, as an engineer, as a technologist?

424
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:49,700
- Oh, yes. When I can't train, I can instantly feel

425
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:55,366
that stress is creeping on me. Like...

426
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:59,933
So even in situations where I'm constrained, I can't go to the

427
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,933
gym, I just keep doing push-ups. I just keep doing squats.

428
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:09,966
- Yeah. I mean, that's the cool thing about bodyweight exercise, you

429
00:31:10,033 --> 00:31:13,933
can just do it anywhere. You could just pop

430
00:31:13,966 --> 00:31:16,300
off 50 or 100 push-ups before a meeting.

431
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,100
- Don't you feel weird when you have a day without physical activity?

432
00:31:21,366 --> 00:31:25,533
- Yeah. If I go a day without doing push-ups, at the very minimum,

433
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:27,666
that's a shitty day.

434
00:31:27,766 --> 00:31:30,033
- And if you can do pull-ups, it's even better.

435
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,433
- Yeah. I gotta ask you about your diet, too. No processed

436
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,333
sugar, no fast food, no soda, intermittent fasting sometimes

437
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:41,433
once a day only, sometimes a couple times a day. So take me

438
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:47,900
through your philosophy on the no sugar, no soda, just clean food.

439
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:51,800
- Well, sugar is pretty easy, because it's addictive.

440
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,766
The more you consume sugar, the more you want it, the hungrier you get.

441
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,766
So if you want to stay efficient and healthy,

442
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,666
why consume processed sugar? You'll just end up snacking all the time.

443
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,900
Intermittent fasting, eating only within six

444
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:20,266
hours or not eating for 18 hours every day also brings

445
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:27,800
structure into your day and into your eating habits, so you

446
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:31,300
don't crave sugar anymore. Because, you know, if you eat sugar and

447
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:39,000
then you're unable to snack, you're just punishing yourself. I read a few books on

448
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,233
longevity. I think something everybody agrees on is that sugar is

449
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:53,933
harmful. Now, I'm not militant about sugar. You can eat berries, fruit, if you

450
00:32:54,033 --> 00:32:59,366
feel your body needs it. But it's not true to think

451
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,733
it's necessary to consume sweet things, not for

452
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,633
children, not for adults. Red meat, I

453
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,533
stopped eating it about 20 years ago, because I just felt heavy

454
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:17,100
every time I had it. So I guess it's individual. It's my

455
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:25,333
metabolism, my digestive system isn't agreeing with this kind of

456
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:32,266
food. So I normally eat seafood of all kinds and vegetables. This is

457
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,966
the basic source of calories for me.

458
00:33:37,033 --> 00:33:41,000
- Yeah, and like all things you said, short-term pleasure isn't

459
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:44,966
worth your future. So, a lot of things we all know, that alcohol is destructive to the

460
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,600
body, tobacco, pills, processed food, sugar. But society puts that on you, makes it

461
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:56,300
very difficult to avoid. So, I guess it all boils down to just discipline.

462
00:33:56,333 --> 00:34:02,400
- Yes, and trying to identify the real cause of an issue you're

463
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:10,033
experiencing. If you're experiencing a headache, one solution would be to take

464
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:16,400
a pill, and then the headache disappears. What this pill would actually do, in most

465
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:24,400
cases, it would mute the consequence, your feeling of pain. It's a painkiller.

466
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,400
It will not eliminate the root cause, so you have to ask

467
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:34,733
yourself, "What is it that is causing this headache? Do I need to drink some

468
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,199
water? Is the air quality here bad? Do I need to start getting more

469
00:34:41,233 --> 00:34:44,632
sleep? Is there something wrong with people around me

470
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,233
that are stressing me out?" There must be some reason why you're

471
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:53,233
experiencing a headache. But if you take a pill,

472
00:34:53,266 --> 00:34:58,733
you're not removing this reason. You're actually making it worse, because this

473
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,966
harmful factor is still there. It's like you're piloting a helicopter,

474
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,666
and there are some red signals, some red lamps start to blink

475
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:13,300
and it starts producing bad, unpleasant

476
00:35:13,366 --> 00:35:16,833
noise. What would you do? You would try to figure

477
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,700
out the cause and eliminate it. Maybe there is some

478
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:25,100
mountain next to you and you have to avoid it, or you take a hammer

479
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:28,700
and smash the signal.

480
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:32,633
I think the good answer is quite obvious. So, why are we constantly doing

481
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:36,400
this regardless? Well, because everybody else is doing it, because there's a whole

482
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,433
industry trying to persuade you that this is the right

483
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:44,266
thing to do. So it's incredibly important

484
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,866
to analyze yourself and try to get to the bottom of things.

485
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,100
- So, you generally try to avoid all pills, all pharmaceutical products?

486
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:57,133
- Yes. I've been staying away from all of that since

487
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:01,666
I became an adult. When you're a teenager, your mom would typically

488
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:07,866
say, "We need to take this pill, otherwise, you know, the world collapses."

489
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:14,700
Once I became a grown-up, I said, "No, I don't think that the producers of pills are

490
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:20,533
incentivized in the right way." They are not really interested in

491
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:29,033
eliminating the root of the problem. They would rather have me dependent on

492
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:33,300
the pills they're producing so that I could buy them

493
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:37,333
forever. And then I also realized... No, I'm not saying

494
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,433
that you should never take pills. There are obviously some diseases

495
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,566
that you can only fight with antibiotics, for example,

496
00:36:50,633 --> 00:36:54,500
so I'm not suggesting we go back to the Middle Ages.

497
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,100
But what I'm saying is we overuse pills.

498
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:03,066
- Yeah, it's always good to study and deeply understand the incentives under which

499
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,033
the world operates

500
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,433
so that you don't get swept up into the forces that operate under these

501
00:37:08,466 --> 00:37:11,766
incentives. And big pharma is certainly one of

502
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,433
them. Pharmaceutical companies have a huge incentive to keep the

503
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,533
problem going versus solving the problem. It's wise.

504
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,500
- Well, this is something I practice every day. I

505
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:30,400
read some piece of news, and I ask myself, "Who benefits from me reading this?"

506
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:34,933
then you can end up coming to this conclusion that

507
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:39,866
maybe 95% of things we read in the news have been written

508
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,533
and published because somebody wanted you to buy some product,

509
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,133
support some political cause, fight some war, donate some money, just do something

510
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,600
that would benefit other people. And this is not a problem

511
00:38:01,766 --> 00:38:05,300
to support causes that you truly believe in, as

512
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:10,833
long as it was your intentional choice, and you're not being manipulated

513
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:14,133
into fighting other people's wars.

514
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:17,200
- And that takes us back to the original thing we started talking about, which is

515
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:21,133
freedom. One of the ways to achieve freedom of thought is to

516
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:29,133
remove your mind from the influences, the forces that manipulate you. That's really

517
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:32,700
important to realize. The content you

518
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:36,700
consume, especially on the internet, when a large percentage of it

519
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:40,700
is designed to manipulate your mind, you have to disconnect yourself

520
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:44,933
and be very proactive, understanding what the bias is, what the incentives

521
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:50,900
are, so you can think clearly, independently, and objectively.

522
00:38:50,966 --> 00:38:56,300
- And again, it ties back with restraint from alcohol.

523
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:01,266
Because if your mind is clouded, how can you

524
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:09,200
analyze yourself? You'll always be dependent on opinions of others. You will

525
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:12,900
always follow the mainstream, and w-

526
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,100
then whatever the authorities or whoever in charge

527
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,933
will tell you, you'll believe it, because you don't have a tool

528
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:26,433
of your own to rely on to come to your own conclusions.

529
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,233
- I have to ask you, this is something that came up. You don't watch

530
00:39:31,266 --> 00:39:35,066
porn. I don't think I've heard you talk about this before. What's the

531
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,800
philosophy behind not watching porn? You know, there's a lot of people that talk

532
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:43,700
about porn in general having a very negative effect on young men,

533
00:39:44,533 --> 00:39:47,933
on their view of the world, on their development of their sexuality, and how

534
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,966
they get into relationships, and all that kind of stuff. So what's

535
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,166
your philosophy in not consuming porn?

536
00:39:55,366 --> 00:39:59,033
- I don't watch porn because I just feel it's a

537
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:03,733
surrogate, a substitute for the real thing that

538
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:11,333
is not necessary in my life. If anything, it just forces

539
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,566
you to exchange some energy,

540
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:20,833
some inspiration, to a fleeting moment of pleasure. It doesn't

541
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:24,433
make sense. And i- in any case, as I

542
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,000
said, it's not the real thing. So as long as you

543
00:40:28,566 --> 00:40:32,166
can access the real thing, you don't need to watch

544
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:35,833
porn. But then, if you can't access the real thing,

545
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,800
it's... you shouldn't watch porn as well, because it

546
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,533
means there's some deficiency in your life, some problem that you have to overcome.

547
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:48,500
- Yeah, analyze the underlying cause.

548
00:40:49,733 --> 00:40:53,300
And again, this goes back to the theme of investing in a

549
00:40:53,866 --> 00:41:01,233
long-term flourishing versus short-term pleasure. There's a theme

550
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,833
to the way you approach life.

551
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,733
- I try to be strategic. I try to act

552
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:09,466
under the assumption that I'm not going to die in one hour from

553
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,433
now, and I'm going to stick around for a bit, despite

554
00:41:13,433 --> 00:41:17,000
the fact that we are all mortal. So why would I

555
00:41:18,133 --> 00:41:23,000
exchange the mid and long-term for the short-term? Doesn't make any sense.

556
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,700
- Quick pause, bathroom break.

557
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,466
- Yeah, let's take a break.

558
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,400
- All right, we took a break, and now we're back. I gotta ask you about Telegram,

559
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:33,600
the company. I got to meet some of the brilliant engineers that work there.

560
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,166
Telegram runs lean. Relative to other technology

561
00:41:38,233 --> 00:41:42,000
companies that achieve the scale that Telegram does, it has very few employees.

562
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,566
So how many people are on the core team, let's say the core engineering team?

563
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:54,600
- The core engineering team is about 40 people. This includes

564
00:41:56,066 --> 00:42:02,733
backend, frontend designers, system administrators.

565
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:10,200
- Can you speak to the philosophy behind running a company with so few employees?

566
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:12,566
- Well, what we realized really early is that

567
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,600
quantity of employees doesn't translate to quality of the product they

568
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:22,800
produce. In many cases, it's the opposite.

569
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:28,333
If you have too many people, they have to coordinate their efforts, constantly

570
00:42:28,366 --> 00:42:32,833
communicate, and 90% of their time will be spent on

571
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:39,766
coordinating the small pieces of work they're responsible for between each other.

572
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:45,766
The other problem with having too many employees is that

573
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:51,133
some of them won't get enough work to do. And if

574
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:54,966
they don't get enough work to do, they demotivate everybody else by their mere

575
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,500
existence. They're still there, they're still getting the

576
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:02,233
salary, but they don't do anything. And if they don't do

577
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,533
anything, more often than not, they will start trying to

578
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:12,800
find their purpose elsewhere, maybe inside your team,

579
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:20,633
but not by doing productive work, but by finding problems that don't exist

580
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:25,800
within the team. And that can disrupt the team and

581
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:32,900
the mood inside it even further. Also, when you

582
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:38,400
intentionally don't allow some of your team members

583
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:46,433
to hire more people to help them, they will be forced to automate things. In

584
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,233
our case, you know, we have

585
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:58,533
tens of thousands of servers around the world, almost 100,000, distributed across

586
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,900
several continents and data centers. If you try to manage this system

587
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:09,333
manually without automation,

588
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:14,033
you will probably end up hiring thousands of people, tens of thousands of people.

589
00:44:14,066 --> 00:44:19,500
But if you rely on algorithms and the team is forced to

590
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:25,700
put together algorithms in order to manage it, then it becomes much more

591
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,633
scalable, and much more efficient, and interestingly, much more reliable as well.

592
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,833
- And more resilient to the changing geopolitics, to

593
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:39,100
the changing technology, all of that. Because if you automate

594
00:44:40,233 --> 00:44:43,500
the distributed aspect of the data storage and all the

595
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:47,300
compute, then that's going to be resilient to everything the world throws at

596
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:54,166
you. I suppose if you have people managing all of it, it becomes stale quickly.

597
00:44:54,266 --> 00:45:01,600
- Yes. Humans are attack vectors. And if you have a distributed system

598
00:45:01,633 --> 00:45:05,533
that runs itself automatically, you have a

599
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:09,433
a chance at increasing the security and speed of your service.

600
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,500
and speed of your service. This is what we did with Telegram,

601
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:17,933
while also making it much more

602
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,933
reliable. Because if some part of the network goes down,

603
00:45:21,966 --> 00:45:25,666
can still switch to the other parts of it.

604
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:29,566
- Yeah. One of the big ways to protect user privacy

605
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:33,533
is that you store the data. The infrastructure side of Telegram

606
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:36,933
infrastructure side of Telegram is distributed across many legal jurisdictions

607
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,766
many legal jurisdictions with the decryption keys. So it's encrypted in the cloud,

608
00:45:40,866 --> 00:45:44,833
keys. So it's encrypted in the cloud, the decryption keys are split

609
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:48,933
and kept in different locations so that no single government or entity

610
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,466
entity can access the data. Can you explain the strength of this approach?

611
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,533
- The way we designed Telegram is

612
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:07,266
we never wanted to have any humans, any employees have any access

613
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:15,800
to private messaging data. That's why since 2012, when we've been trying to come up with this design,

614
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:19,633
been trying to come up with this design, we always invested a lot of effort

615
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:23,000
invested a lot of effort into making sure that nobody can mess with it.

616
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:27,366
into making sure that nobody can mess with it. Like if you hire an employee

617
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,833
employee or any of the existing employee, they can't break the system

618
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:33,933
they can't break the system in a way that would allow them to access messages of users.

619
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,833
access messages of users. And then of course, we launched end-to-end encrypted messaging

620
00:46:38,266 --> 00:46:42,166
end-to-end encrypted messaging that is even more protected, but it has certain limitations,

621
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,800
but it has certain limitations, so you still have to rely on encrypted cloud. So an interesting

622
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:49,833
encrypted cloud. So an interesting

623
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,733
engineering challenge was how do you make sure that no point of failure can be created

624
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,633
that no point of failure can be created within your team or outside?

625
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,533
- So no employee can even access user messages. So that's the thing. You know, we talk about encryption,

626
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:06,466
thing. You know, we talk about encryption, we talk about privacy, we talk about security, all these kinds of things.

627
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:10,500
all these kinds of things. I think the number one thing that people are concerned about, about which there's also

628
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:16,366
about which there's also misinformation, is about private messages. So Telegram is very, very protective

629
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,900
private messages. So Telegram is very, very protective of the private messages of users. So you're saying

630
00:47:22,933 --> 00:47:28,866
saying employees never can access the private messages.

631
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,700
Have any governments or intelligence agencies ever accessed private user messages in the past?

632
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:38,333
agencies ever accessed private user messages in the past?

633
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:42,066
- No, never. Telegram has never shared a single private message with anyone,

634
00:47:42,133 --> 00:47:45,733
a single private message with anyone, including governments and intelligence services.

635
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:53,066
including governments and intelligence services. If you try to access any server in any of the data center

636
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:58,433
data center locations, it's all encrypted. You can extract all the hard drives

637
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:03,200
and analyze it, but you won't get anything. It's all encrypted in a way that is undecipherable.

638
00:48:04,133 --> 00:48:07,166
It's all encrypted in the way that is undecipherable.

639
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:13,933
That was very important for us. That's why we can say with confidence

640
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:23,600
there hasn't been ever a leakage of data, any leak of data from Telegram.

641
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,400
Not in terms of private messages, not in terms of, say, contact lists.

642
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:34,933
- Do you see in the future a possible scenario where you might share user private messages

643
00:48:35,033 --> 00:48:39,833
where you might share user private messages with governments or with intelligence agencies?

644
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,533
- No. We designed the system in a way that it's impossible.

645
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,533
impossible. It would require us to change the system, and we won't do that because we made a promise to our

646
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,500
and we won't do that because we made a promise to our

647
00:48:50,566 --> 00:48:56,733
We would rather shut Telegram down in a certain country than do that.

648
00:48:56,766 --> 00:49:00,633
- So that's one of the principles you operate under: you're going to

649
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:03,166
protect user privacy.

650
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:10,333
- I think it's fundamental. Without the right to privacy, people can't feel fully free

651
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,233
and protected.

652
00:49:11,266 --> 00:49:15,233
- I mean, this is a good place to ask. I'm sure you're pressured by all

653
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,266
kinds of people, all kinds of organizations to share

654
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:23,400
private data. Where do you find the strength

655
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,566
and the fearlessness to say no to everybody, including

656
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:32,533
powerful intelligence agencies, including powerful governments, influential powerful

657
00:49:32,566 --> 00:49:33,800
people?

658
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:38,800
- I guess part of it is just me being me. I stood up

659
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:45,200
for myself and for my values since I was a little kid.

660
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:49,233
I had issues with my teachers because I would

661
00:49:49,266 --> 00:49:53,166
point out their mistakes during classes. And at the end of

662
00:49:53,233 --> 00:49:57,166
the day, what's important is to remind yourself that you have nothing to lose.

663
00:49:57,233 --> 00:50:01,033
They can think they blackmail you with something, they can threaten you with something.

664
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,833
But what is it they really can do to you?

665
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,100
Worst case, they can kill you. But that brings us back to the first part of our discussion.

666
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:15,366
But that brings us back to the first part of our discussion.

667
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:20,233
There's no point living your life in fear.

668
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:25,433
As for Telegram, it's incredibly successful. But if

669
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,333
we lose one market or two markets, or pretty much all of the markets,

670
00:50:31,366 --> 00:50:35,133
I don't care that much. It won't affect me, it won't affect my lifestyle in any

671
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:41,300
way. I will still be doing my push-ups, you know? So...

672
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:47,000
You don't like encryption, you don't like privacy, you think you

673
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:50,900
should ban encryption in your country, like the European Union

674
00:50:50,966 --> 00:50:54,266
is trying to do now for all the member states.

675
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:57,833
Well, go ahead and do that. We'll just quit this

676
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,800
market. We won't operate there. It's not that important. They all think that

677
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:09,833
somehow we profit from their citizens and the only goal tech companies have is

678
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,366
extracting revenues. And it's true, most tech companies are like this.

679
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:18,233
But there are projects like Telegram which are a bit

680
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:23,133
different. And I'm not sure they realize that.

681
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,833
- So for you, the value of maintaining your integrity

682
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,733
in relation to your principles is

683
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,666
more important than anything else. And of course, we should say

684
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:37,466
that you also have full ability and control to do just that because

685
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:44,600
you, Pavel Durov, own 100% of Telegram. So there's nobody else

686
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:47,600
with a say on this question.

687
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:51,400
- There are no shareholders, which is quite unique.

688
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,200
- Very unique. I don't think there's anything even close to that in any major tech

689
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:56,333
company.

690
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,133
- And this allows us to operate the way we operate.

691
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,500
build this project and maintain it based on certain

692
00:52:08,533 --> 00:52:12,566
fundamental principles which, by the way, I think everybody believes in.

693
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,766
I think the right to privacy

694
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:19,433
is included in the constitution of most countries, at least most

695
00:52:19,466 --> 00:52:22,266
Western countries. But it's still under attack

696
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,500
almost every week, and it often starts with

697
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,300
well-meaning proposals: "Oh, we have to fight crime.

698
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:36,300
We have to do that. We have to protect the children." But at the end of

699
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:39,966
the day, the result is the same. People lose their right

700
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:44,300
to such a fundamental thing as privacy. They sometimes lose their right

701
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:48,233
to express themselves, to assemble, and this is a slippery slope

702
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,633
that we witnessed in pretty much every autocratic

703
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,766
country, or country that used to be free and then became autocratic.

704
00:52:55,833 --> 00:53:03,900
No dictator in the world ever said, "Let's just strip you away from your rights

705
00:53:04,566 --> 00:53:08,500
because I want more power to myself and I

706
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:11,600
want you to be miserable." They all justified it

707
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:21,000
with very reasonable-sounding justifications, and then it came in stages, gradually.

708
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,933
And after a few years, people would find themselves in

709
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,933
a position when they're helpless. They can't protest. Every

710
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:38,966
message they send is monitored. They can't assemble. It's over.

711
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,366
- So you see Telegram as a place that people from all walks of

712
00:53:42,433 --> 00:53:45,033
life, from every nation can have a place

713
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,066
to speak their mind, to have a voice. In the

714
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,000
context, in the geopolitical context that you're mentioning that governments

715
00:53:54,033 --> 00:53:57,733
when they become autocratic, naturally it's the way of the

716
00:53:57,766 --> 00:54:01,566
world, human nature and the nature of governments, they become more censorious.

717
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,200
They begin to censor, and always justifying it in their

718
00:54:06,233 --> 00:54:08,766
minds perhaps assuming that they are doing good.

719
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,766
- Perhaps some of them assume they are doing good, but

720
00:54:12,833 --> 00:54:20,200
interestingly, it always results in the state accumulating more power at the

721
00:54:20,233 --> 00:54:27,700
expense of the individual. And then where does it stop? You know, we

722
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,733
humans are not very good at finding the right

723
00:54:30,833 --> 00:54:34,700
balance, and in this case, the right balance between chaos

724
00:54:34,733 --> 00:54:44,000
and order, between freedom and structure. We tend to go to extremes.

725
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:47,933
- I think you still consider yourself a libertarian. There is something about

726
00:54:47,966 --> 00:54:54,366
government that always, over time, naturally builds a larger and larger

727
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:58,333
bureaucracy, and in that machine of bureaucracy, it

728
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,900
accumulates more and more power. And it's not always that some one individual

729
00:55:04,966 --> 00:55:06,966
member of that bureaucracy

730
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,633
is the one that corrupts the initial principles on which the government was founded, but

731
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:19,000
just something over time, you forget. You begin to censor. You begin to limit

732
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,000
the freedoms of the individual, the ability of the individuals

733
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:28,233
to speak, to have a voice, to vote. It just gradually happens that way.

734
00:55:29,066 --> 00:55:32,366
- And the government is not some abstract notion. The government

735
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:39,700
consists of people, and these people have goals. They would naturally be

736
00:55:39,733 --> 00:55:43,666
inclined to increase their level of influence,

737
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,333
to have more subordinates, to have more resources,

738
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:55,300
and that's how you end up in an endless loop of, you know, ever-increasing

739
00:55:55,366 --> 00:56:03,233
taxes, ever-increasing regulation, which ultimately just suffocates

740
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,766
free market, free enterprise, and free speech. So, you

741
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:15,333
do want to have very, very strict limitations on the extent the

742
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,433
government can increase its powers at the expense of

743
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:22,500
citizens. Ironically, you don't have those limitations.

744
00:56:22,533 --> 00:56:28,333
You're supposed to, in all countries which are considered to be free.

745
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,700
It's supposed to be the Constitution that protects everybody,

746
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:39,100
but interestingly, it doesn't always work this way. They are able to find

747
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,400
very tricky phrasings in order to carve out exceptions,

748
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,400
and then the exception becomes the rule.

749
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,100
- On this topic,

750
00:56:51,933 --> 00:56:55,900
I'd love to talk to you about the recent saga of you being arrested in

751
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,633
August of last year in France. I think I should say that

752
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:08,066
it's one of the worst overreaches of power I've seen as applied to a tech leader in

753
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,233
recent history, in all history.

754
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,533
So it's tragic, but I think speaks to the thing that we've

755
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:20,400
been talking about. So maybe can you tell the full

756
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:24,233
saga what happened? You arrive in France...

757
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:29,466
- I arrived in France last year in August just for a short two-day trip,

758
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:38,466
and then I see a dozen armed policemen greeting me and asking me to follow

759
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:50,133
them. They read me a list of something like 15 serious crimes that I'm accused of,

760
00:57:52,900 --> 00:58:00,533
which was mind-boggling. At first, I thought there must be some mistake. Then I

761
00:58:00,566 --> 00:58:02,066
realized they're being serious,

762
00:58:03,633 --> 00:58:07,666
and they're accusing me of all possible crimes that the users of Telegram have

763
00:58:09,066 --> 00:58:17,533
allegedly committed, or some users. And they think I should be responsible for this,

764
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:22,333
which again, like you said, is something that never happened in the history

765
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,500
of this planet. No country, not even an

766
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:35,566
authoritarian one, did that to any tech leader, at

767
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:41,166
least at this scale. There are good reasons for that, because you're sacrificing

768
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,366
a big part of your economic growth by sending these kinds of messages

769
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:54,200
to the business and tech community. So they put me in

770
00:58:54,233 --> 00:59:01,700
a police car, and I found myself in police custody.

771
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:10,466
A small room, no windows. Just a narrow bed

772
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,733
made of concrete. I spent almost four days there.

773
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:20,866
In the process, I had to answer some questions of the

774
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:29,866
policemen. They were interested in how Telegram operates.

775
00:59:31,966 --> 00:59:37,033
Most of it is public anyway, and I was struck by

776
00:59:39,233 --> 00:59:43,500
very limited understanding, or should I say, even a lack of understanding

777
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:51,100
on behalf of the people who initiated this investigation against me about how

778
00:59:51,966 --> 00:59:57,600
technology works, how encryption works, how social media work.

779
00:59:57,666 --> 01:00:01,066
- I mean, there's something darkly poetic about a tech founder of a

780
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,933
platform where a billion people are communicating with each other, and

781
01:00:04,966 --> 01:00:08,866
you're on concrete, no pillow, for days,

782
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:12,800
no windows. It's like a book. I mean, it reminds me, I'm a huge fan of Franz

783
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:16,166
Kafka, and he's written about the absurdity of these kinds of

784
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,166
situations, hence the Kafkaesque stories. There's a story

785
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:24,200
literally about the situation that he wrote, perhaps predicted,

786
01:00:24,233 --> 01:00:27,766
called "The Trial," where a person is arrested for no

787
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,766
reason that anybody can explain and is stuck in the judicial

788
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:38,366
system for a long time. Fascinatingly, in that story, neither the person

789
01:00:38,366 --> 01:00:42,266
arrested nor any individual member of the system itself

790
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:47,000
fully understands what is happening. Nobody can truly answer the questions,

791
01:00:47,966 --> 01:00:51,900
and eventually the person, spoiler alert, is mentally broken

792
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:55,833
by the whole system, which is what bureaucracy can do in

793
01:00:55,866 --> 01:01:01,400
its most absurd forms. It breaks the spirit, the human spirit latent in all of us.

794
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,166
That's the negative side of bureaucracy.

795
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:14,200
- I agree with you on the absurdity of this thing, because if this was a

796
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,366
good faith attempt to fix an issue,

797
01:01:19,266 --> 01:01:23,233
there were so many ways to reach out to Telegram,

798
01:01:23,233 --> 01:01:28,400
to reach out to me personally, voice their concerns, and solve

799
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:36,366
any alleged problem in a way that is conventional and diplomatic, the way every

800
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,300
other country on this planet solves its problems,

801
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:43,433
including with Telegram, and we did it dozens of times.

802
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:47,466
- Yeah, you have a nice page showing this. This is kind of like details that most

803
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:54,666
people don't really think about. But Telegram was at the forefront of

804
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:02,766
moderating CSAM and terrorist groups. There's a nice page, telegram.org/moderation,

805
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,433
that shows just the incredible amount of groups and

806
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,333
channels that are engaged in terrorist activity and CSAM

807
01:02:10,566 --> 01:02:14,333
activity that are blocked, actively blocked, found and

808
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,300
blocked by Telegram. And a lot of this work, like you said, because of the automation

809
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:22,200
that's done with machine learning, just the scale is insane. This

810
01:02:22,266 --> 01:02:26,233
is stuff that most noobs like me who are just chatting it up on Telegram don't

811
01:02:26,266 --> 01:02:29,433
think about. But there's just an immense number of

812
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,266
people essentially doing things that violate the

813
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:39,233
law on there, and you have to find them immediately and catch it. I guess

814
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,833
all platforms have to deal with it, and Telegram was doing a great job of

815
01:02:43,566 --> 01:02:47,700
dealing with that kind of content. And what you're saying is the French government

816
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,500
had no idea.

817
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,233
- Do they even know what machine learning is?

818
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:57,400
- It's a concept that is challenging to explain to them,

819
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,200
but I think they will learn much more about it by the end of this

820
01:03:01,233 --> 01:03:02,633
investigation. That's my hope.

821
01:03:03,766 --> 01:03:08,400
In any case, you're right. I mean, if you look at Telegram, we've been fighting

822
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:14,466
harmful content that is publicly distributed on our platform

823
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:19,200
since 10 years ago, actually, since the

824
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:23,766
time we launched public channels on Telegram. And since

825
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,666
something like eight years ago, we had daily transparency reports

826
01:03:31,666 --> 01:03:38,400
on how many channels related to child abuse or terrorist propaganda

827
01:03:39,466 --> 01:03:46,433
we've taken down daily. Every day, we've taken like, maybe hundreds of them.

828
01:03:47,633 --> 01:03:54,833
And if you include all kinds of content that we remove, all the accounts,

829
01:03:54,866 --> 01:03:59,166
groups, channels, posts, that would amount to

830
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,900
millions of pieces of content every week, hundreds of thousands every day.

831
01:04:05,766 --> 01:04:09,366
And then somebody would read the newspaper, get enraged

832
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:15,600
because they would read something about child porn, and this is a subject that

833
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:24,800
is very emotionally charged, and start doing something not based on data

834
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:35,700
and logical thinking and laws, but based on emotions driven from inaccurate input.

835
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:39,966
- Yeah, I think we should make it pretty clear that there's no world, no reason that the

836
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,366
French government should have arrested you, but here we are. That's the situation you're

837
01:04:43,433 --> 01:04:47,200
in. So to be clear, you have to show up in front of a

838
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,233
judge. Now all of this is beautifully absurd. It would be hilarious if it wasn't

839
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,533
extremely serious. You have to show up in front of a judge

840
01:04:55,933 --> 01:05:01,766
every certain amount of time. And what is that experience like?

841
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:05,566
- In France, they have this role of investigative judge. I don't think you have it

842
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,133
in many other places in the world. It means I'm not on trial,

843
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:12,733
I'm being investigated.

844
01:05:14,366 --> 01:05:18,166
And in France, it's not just the police or prosecutor asking me

845
01:05:18,233 --> 01:05:23,433
questions, it's a judge, which, in my experience, is more like

846
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:32,133
still a prosecutor, but it's called a judge, and that makes it harder to appeal. So

847
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:35,800
if you're limited in, say, countries where you can

848
01:05:35,833 --> 01:05:39,700
travel, then to appeal that restriction will take you a lot of time.

849
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:49,666
The investigation itself should have never been started. It's an absurd and harmful

850
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:57,366
way of solving an issue as complicated as

851
01:05:58,966 --> 01:06:03,033
regulating social media. It's just the wrong tool.

852
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:10,600
So we objected and appealed the investigation

853
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:15,933
itself. We did last year, I believe. We're still not even given

854
01:06:17,766 --> 01:06:25,033
a hearing date for the appeal, because the process is painfully slow,

855
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,733
not just for me but for everybody, which made

856
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:35,866
me realize the system may be broken on many levels. You have

857
01:06:36,933 --> 01:06:41,266
other entrepreneurs affected by the French justice system

858
01:06:42,633 --> 01:06:49,833
telling me horror stories about their experiences, where businesses

859
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:58,500
got paralyzed by very unnecessary actions of investigative judges that ended

860
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:06,533
up being unjustified and biased. And in the end, you can perhaps solve it when

861
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,933
you reach a higher court

862
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:17,533
and you'll get justice, but you'll lose a lot of time and energy in the process.

863
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:22,366
So this is the only thing that is, I hope, different,

864
01:07:23,633 --> 01:07:31,000
and will be different in this case compared to the story you told from Kafka.

865
01:07:31,066 --> 01:07:34,566
- I mean, but it does, as Kafka describes, break a lot of people

866
01:07:34,966 --> 01:07:38,800
with time. So when do you hope... We should say that you were

867
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:42,033
for a long time not allowed to travel out of France. Now

868
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,233
you can travel to Dubai. We're now in Dubai. Got to

869
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:51,033
meet many of the people that work at Telegram.

870
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:54,900
Telegram is headquartered in Dubai. But you're not allowed to travel anywhere

871
01:07:54,966 --> 01:08:01,233
else. When do you think you're coming to Texas to hang out with me over there?

872
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:07,033
- That's a hard question to answer because it doesn't depend on just my actions.

873
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:19,533
I can just say this: I am patient. I will not let this limitation on my

874
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:31,800
freedom dictate my actions. I will, if anything, double down on defending

875
01:08:31,832 --> 01:08:40,399
freedoms because I experienced firsthand what the absence of freedom feels like, at

876
01:08:40,466 --> 01:08:45,433
least during those four days in police custody when you are stuck,

877
01:08:47,566 --> 01:08:54,000
just stuck, unable to communicate with people

878
01:08:55,200 --> 01:09:00,300
that are important to you. When you don't even know what's going on in the world

879
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,332
in relation to you personally. So I have no crystal ball that

880
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,800
would tell me the future. I can't say that I'm

881
01:09:09,832 --> 01:09:15,033
pessimistic. I think we've been able to gradually remove

882
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:23,566
most of the restrictions initially imposed on my freedom last August.

883
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:26,600
- If the French government or the French intelligence agency

884
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:32,533
want to have a backdoor to access private user messages,

885
01:09:34,033 --> 01:09:37,832
what would you say to them? Is there

886
01:09:37,866 --> 01:09:42,933
anything they can do to get access to the private user messages?

887
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:50,700
- Nothing. My response would be very clear... but it

888
01:09:50,765 --> 01:09:52,765
won't be very polite, so I'm not sure.

889
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,500
- It's good to say here.

890
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,933
- It's good to say because you're wearing a tie and-

891
01:09:58,033 --> 01:10:01,266
- Yeah. This is a serious adult gentleman-like

892
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:05,233
program. But it is a concern that people have is when

893
01:10:05,366 --> 01:10:09,200
you have so much pressure from governments, that over time, they'll

894
01:10:09,266 --> 01:10:14,733
wear you down and you'll give in. And then, of course, other places

895
01:10:15,833 --> 01:10:19,733
use that as propaganda, try to attack you. You get attacked by basically every nation.

896
01:10:19,766 --> 01:10:22,800
So it's a difficult

897
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:26,866
medium in which to operate. It's difficult to be you, fighting for

898
01:10:26,866 --> 01:10:30,733
freedom, fighting to preserve people's privacy. But is there something you could say

899
01:10:30,766 --> 01:10:34,500
to reassure people that you're not going to sacrifice

900
01:10:35,066 --> 01:10:38,933
any of the principles that you've just expressed? If the

901
01:10:38,966 --> 01:10:42,133
French government just keeps wearing you down?

902
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:47,466
- I think the French government is losing this battle. This battle is wrong.

903
01:10:48,633 --> 01:10:59,300
The more pressure I get, the more resilient and defiant I become.

904
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,166
And I think I have proven that in the last several

905
01:11:03,233 --> 01:11:10,900
months, when there were attempts to use my situation, being stuck here in France, by

906
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:14,000
approaching me and asking me to do things

907
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,300
in other countries, blocking certain channels,

908
01:11:19,733 --> 01:11:23,233
changing the way Telegram works. And not only I

909
01:11:23,266 --> 01:11:28,666
refused, I told the world about it, and I'm going to keep telling the world

910
01:11:29,566 --> 01:11:31,066
about every instance

911
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:36,666
any government, in this case, in particular, the French government,

912
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:41,466
tries to force me to do anything.

913
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,666
And I would rather lose everything I have than yield to

914
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,233
this pressure, because if you

915
01:11:50,333 --> 01:11:54,133
submit to this pressure and agree with something that is fundamentally

916
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:58,233
wrong and violates the rights of other people as well,

917
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:04,633
you become broken inside. You become a shell of your former self

918
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:09,500
on a deep biological and spiritual level.

919
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:14,300
So, I wouldn't do that. There are probably other people in the world that would

920
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:20,733
consider that, but I don't care. Telegram disappears, too. Something people don't

921
01:12:20,766 --> 01:12:27,533
understand, including in these intelligence services or governments. I don't

922
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:37,433
care. I'll be fine. If they put me into prison for 20 years,

923
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:42,933
which, let's be clear, it's not something that I think is realistic, but let's

924
01:12:45,033 --> 01:12:50,133
just think about it as a hypothetical situation,

925
01:12:51,466 --> 01:12:56,833
I would rather starve myself to death and die there, reboot the whole game,

926
01:12:58,533 --> 01:12:59,833
than do something stupid.

927
01:13:01,466 --> 01:13:05,233
- Let me ask you about an example of the thing you're talking about. Tell the saga of

928
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:08,666
Telegram in the Romanian election. So, amidst all

929
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:12,066
this, you are still fighting to preserve the freedom of

930
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:16,266
speech. What happened, and what were some of the decisions you had to make?

931
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:25,066
- So, when I got stuck in France, unable to leave the country for a few months, I was

932
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:31,233
offered to meet the head of state foreign intelligence services through a person I

933
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:33,866
know quite well. He's actually a

934
01:13:35,466 --> 01:13:39,333
well-known tech entrepreneur in France, and he's well-connected, and he

935
01:13:39,433 --> 01:13:43,400
said, "This guy wants to meet you." I said, "Okay, fine. Let's do that, but I'm

936
01:13:43,433 --> 01:13:48,500
not promising anything." I took the meeting, and in this

937
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:57,400
meeting, I was asked to restrict what I see as restriction of freedom of

938
01:13:57,466 --> 01:14:05,966
speech in Romania. I don't know if you follow the whole saga with the Romanian

939
01:14:05,966 --> 01:14:09,933
elections. They had presidential elections last year.

940
01:14:09,966 --> 01:14:13,200
The results were- got canceled.

941
01:14:13,266 --> 01:14:17,233
Now, Romania, at that point when I had this meeting, was preparing for

942
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:23,900
a new presidential election. The conservative candidate was not somebody who

943
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:28,733
the French government was supportive of, so they asked me

944
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:34,133
whether I would be shutting down, or ready to shut down,

945
01:14:35,666 --> 01:14:41,933
channels on Telegram that supported the conservative candidate, or protest

946
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,733
against the pro-European candidates, so they

947
01:14:46,766 --> 01:14:50,666
called the guy they liked. I said, "Look,

948
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:54,366
if there is no violation of the rules of Telegram, which are quite

949
01:14:54,433 --> 01:15:00,233
clear, you can't call to violence. But if it's a peaceful

950
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:07,166
demonstration, if it's a peaceful debate, we can't do this. It would be political

951
01:15:07,233 --> 01:15:11,066
censorship. We protected freedom of speech in

952
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:15,033
many countries in the world, including in Asia, in Eastern

953
01:15:15,133 --> 01:15:20,766
Europe, in the Middle East. We're not going to start engaging in censorship in

954
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,166
Europe, no matter who's asking

955
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:29,066
us." I was very clear to the guy who was the head of French intelligence.

956
01:15:30,366 --> 01:15:35,933
I said, "If you think that because I'm stuck here, you can tell me what to

957
01:15:35,966 --> 01:15:42,200
do, you're very wrong. I would rather do the opposite every

958
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:53,033
time." And in a way, that's what I did. I um... had a small debate with

959
01:15:53,066 --> 01:15:56,966
him about the morality of this, this whole thing, and then

960
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,966
at a certain point, just disclosed the content of this

961
01:16:00,966 --> 01:16:04,866
entire conversation, because I never signed an NDA. I don't ever sign

962
01:16:04,933 --> 01:16:10,433
NDAs with any people like that. I want to be able to tell the world what's going on.

963
01:16:12,933 --> 01:16:16,766
And that's quite shocking to me,

964
01:16:17,566 --> 01:16:24,200
that you would have people in the French government trying to get an advantage

965
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:29,300
of this situation. Of course, if, you know, they had nothing

966
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:33,366
to do with the start of this investigation itself,

967
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:45,800
and use it to reach their political or geopolitical goals. I consider it

968
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,833
an attempt to humiliate myself personally and

969
01:16:51,266 --> 01:16:55,066
millions of Telegram users collectively. And it's quite

970
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:59,133
strange that the same agency asked us to do certain things in Moldova as well.

971
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:03,100
do certain things in Moldova as well. So even before that, I

972
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,733
think it was October of last year, or September. I

973
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:10,766
was arrested in Paris in late August,

974
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:16,633
and then again approached through an intermediary, and asked, "Would you

975
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:22,833
mind taking down some channels in Moldova? Because there is an election going on,

976
01:17:23,666 --> 01:17:29,266
and we're afraid there's going to be some interference with these elections.

977
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:38,333
Could you please connect with the representatives of the government of Moldova

978
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:44,200
and take care of it?" We said, "We're happy to take a look at it and see if

979
01:17:45,766 --> 01:17:48,666
there is content there that is in violation of our rules." And they sent us a list

980
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:52,033
rules." And they sent us a list of channels and bots.

981
01:17:52,066 --> 01:17:56,000
bots. Some of them were... So it was a very short list, and

982
01:17:56,033 --> 01:17:59,966
some of these channels and bots were

983
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
in violation indeed of our rules, and we took them down, only a few of them.

984
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,833
The rest were okay. Then they said, "Thank you," and sent us another list of

985
01:18:12,866 --> 01:18:15,500
dozens of channels, many, many channels.

986
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,366
We looked at these channels, we realized that there is no solid foundation

987
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:29,133
to justify banning them, and we refused to do that. But interestingly

988
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:44,966
enough, the French intelligence services that were asking us to do this in Moldova

989
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,233
let me know through their contact

990
01:18:52,466 --> 01:18:58,133
that after Telegram banned the few channels that were in

991
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:03,833
violation of our rules in Moldova, they talked to my

992
01:19:03,966 --> 01:19:07,666
judge, the investigative judge in this investigation that is

993
01:19:08,266 --> 01:19:10,600
started, is has been started against me,

994
01:19:12,433 --> 01:19:17,433
and told the judge good things about me, which I found very

995
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:22,700
confusing, and in a way shocking, because

996
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:28,333
these two matters have nothing in common. Why would

997
01:19:29,166 --> 01:19:36,433
anyone talk to an investigative judge that is trying to find out whether Telegram

998
01:19:37,066 --> 01:19:40,366
did a good enough job in

999
01:19:41,866 --> 01:19:50,166
removing illegal content in France? What does Moldova have to do with it?

1000
01:19:50,233 --> 01:19:55,500
I got very suspicious at that moment. Remember, it happened after we

1001
01:19:56,933 --> 01:20:00,666
blocked a few channels that violated our rules, but

1002
01:20:00,766 --> 01:20:04,633
before we refused to block a long list of other channels

1003
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:08,866
that were completely fine, which is people expressing political

1004
01:20:08,966 --> 01:20:15,600
views, which I may not agree with, but it's their right to express them.

1005
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:22,033
Not extreme views, not views that call to violence.

1006
01:20:23,833 --> 01:20:29,333
That was extremely alarming. That was a moment when

1007
01:20:30,933 --> 01:20:34,800
I told myself that there may be more

1008
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,966
going on here that I initially thought. Initially, I thought,

1009
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:46,766
"Yeah, some people are confused about how technology works." And here,

1010
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,666
after this case in Moldova,

1011
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:59,266
I got much more suspicious. So by the time the head of intelligence

1012
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:06,366
services met me to ask about Romania, to help them silencing conservative

1013
01:21:06,433 --> 01:21:18,100
voices in Romania, I was already wary of what could be going on next.

1014
01:21:18,133 --> 01:21:21,700
- Yeah, so clearly this was a systematic

1015
01:21:21,966 --> 01:21:25,800
attempt to pressure you to censor political voices that the French

1016
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:29,666
government doesn't agree with. And we should say that you have fought for

1017
01:21:29,766 --> 01:21:35,566
freedom of speech for left-wing groups and right-wing groups, it really doesn't

1018
01:21:35,633 --> 01:21:39,233
matter. So it's not, you don't have a

1019
01:21:39,266 --> 01:21:43,300
political affiliation, political ideology that you fight for. You're

1020
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:50,233
creating a platform that, as long as they don't call for violence, allows

1021
01:21:50,266 --> 01:21:54,233
people from all walks of life, from all ideologies to speak their mind. That's the whole

1022
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,100
point. And it happens to be conservative voices in the Romanian

1023
01:21:58,133 --> 01:22:01,933
election that the French government wanted to censor, because currently the

1024
01:22:01,933 --> 01:22:04,900
French government leans left. But if you flip everything around

1025
01:22:05,766 --> 01:22:09,433
and the government would be right-wing, you'd be fighting against

1026
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:13,466
censorship of left-wing voices. And you have in the past, many times.

1027
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:17,700
- Exactly. Ironically, we received a request from the

1028
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:23,600
French police to take down a channel of far-left protesters on Telegram

1029
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:32,200
in France. We refused to do that. We looked at the channel, peaceful protesters.

1030
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,333
It doesn't matter for us whether we're defending the freedom of speech of people

1031
01:22:39,133 --> 01:22:44,700
leaning right or leaning left. During COVID, we were protecting

1032
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:51,433
activists that were organizing the Black Lives Matter

1033
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:58,866
events, and the other side, the protesters against

1034
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:04,266
lockdowns. We protect everybody as long as they are

1035
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:10,100
not crossing the lines and not starting to

1036
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:18,000
call to violence or incite damage to public

1037
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:25,233
property. It's a fundamental right to assemble. It's interesting that

1038
01:23:28,133 --> 01:23:33,566
people who haven't had this experience of living in countries

1039
01:23:34,433 --> 01:23:38,766
that don't have freedoms don't always realize

1040
01:23:40,366 --> 01:23:45,833
how dangerous it is to gradually compromise

1041
01:23:48,233 --> 01:23:51,733
your values, your principles, your freedoms, your rights,

1042
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:56,500
because they don't understand what's at stake.

1043
01:23:56,533 --> 01:24:00,400
- Yeah, these things become a slippery slope. So for many,

1044
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:05,200
many years, including currently, you have spoken very highly of France. You love

1045
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:13,700
French history, French culture. I think this situation, this historic wrong that's

1046
01:24:13,733 --> 01:24:20,733
been done is simply just a gigantic PR mistake

1047
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,133
for France. There's no entrepreneur that aspires to

1048
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:29,033
be the next Pavel Durov to create the next Telegram, sees this

1049
01:24:29,233 --> 01:24:32,800
and wants to operate in France after seeing this. There is

1050
01:24:33,733 --> 01:24:37,500
no justification for this arrest, there's a misapplication of the law, all

1051
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:39,266
kinds of pressures, all kinds of

1052
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:44,033
behavior that seems politically motivated, all that kind of stuff, all the excessive

1053
01:24:44,066 --> 01:24:47,866
regulation and bureaucracy. A nightmare for entrepreneurs that

1054
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:51,833
dream to create something impactful and positive for the world. So what do

1055
01:24:51,900 --> 01:24:55,400
you think needs to be fixed about the French government, the French

1056
01:24:55,433 --> 01:24:59,133
system? And then zooming out, because you have seen similar kinds of things in

1057
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:04,000
Europe that could enable entrepreneurs, that could

1058
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:08,000
reverse the trend that we seem to be seeing in Europe

1059
01:25:08,033 --> 01:25:13,166
that is becoming less and less friendly to entrepreneurs.

1060
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,533
What can be fixed? What should be fixed?

1061
01:25:20,733 --> 01:25:30,633
- I think the European society must decide where they want the ever-increasing

1062
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:36,600
public sector to stop increasing, what they think

1063
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:43,700
should be the right size of government. Because today, if you take France, for

1064
01:25:43,733 --> 01:25:50,000
example, which is a beautiful country with a lot of talented people, but

1065
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:56,566
public expenses are 58% of the country's GDP. It's

1066
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:04,200
maybe as much or more than in the latest stage of the Soviet Union.

1067
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:13,033
So you have this balance where you have many more

1068
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:20,400
people representing the state as opposed to people trying to bring the country's

1069
01:26:20,433 --> 01:26:26,533
economy forward by creating great products and great companies.

1070
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:32,800
The startup field, in my field, social media field, has been affected by it immensely.

1071
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:43,300
There was one great startup in this realm in France in the last 10 years. It was

1072
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:47,200
a location-based social network. It was eventually sold

1073
01:26:47,233 --> 01:26:51,066
to Snapchat, but before it was sold, the founder asked me

1074
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,600
whether he should sell. I told him, "Never

1075
01:26:54,733 --> 01:26:58,700
sell. You have a great thing going. You have lots of users.

1076
01:26:58,733 --> 01:27:02,666
You have organic traction in many countries."

1077
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:07,166
And the first of this kind of success story in France.

1078
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:13,300
But then he sold anyway in a couple weeks. And later, I met

1079
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,366
him, he's trying to do a new thing now. I met him and I asked him,

1080
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:22,700
I was trying to understand what went wrong. And one of the things he told me about

1081
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:31,400
is that while he was trying to run his company, you know, competing with Facebook,

1082
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,833
Instagram, Snapchat, having all this pressure from

1083
01:27:34,866 --> 01:27:40,333
investors, trying to hire the best people and persuade them to go to Paris,

1084
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,033
and he did a great job, by the way. But while he was trying to do that,

1085
01:27:47,133 --> 01:27:57,166
he got also attacked by some silly investigation, again involving data protection

1086
01:27:57,266 --> 01:28:04,933
issues, which lasted forever, and was gradually sucking the blood of

1087
01:28:04,966 --> 01:28:10,166
his team and his company, constant interrogations,

1088
01:28:11,466 --> 01:28:15,666
disclosure requests. And this is a young company.

1089
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:21,633
It significantly increases the level of stress, and at some

1090
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:28,066
point, I think the pressure was too much. He decided, "I'm going to just sell

1091
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:32,666
it." Eventually, it turned out that

1092
01:28:34,233 --> 01:28:37,766
there was no issue. The investigation ended, as far as I understand,

1093
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:43,700
with no charges. But such investigations, they have a price, they have a

1094
01:28:43,733 --> 01:28:49,966
cost. And unless the society realizes the cost

1095
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:54,533
of projects, of companies, of startups

1096
01:28:55,033 --> 01:28:58,833
that are never created, or are sold to the United States at the very early

1097
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:06,333
stage, or other countries, resulting in decreased economic growth,

1098
01:29:06,366 --> 01:29:12,433
things won't change. I think we just talked to a guy a few days ago

1099
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:18,033
who left France and started a business here in Dubai, and one of the

1100
01:29:18,066 --> 01:29:22,766
reasons he had to leave France is that the government started an investigation

1101
01:29:24,933 --> 01:29:29,633
on his company, and they froze his bank accounts, and this investigation

1102
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:34,600
that involved taxes lasted for many, many years. I believe he said eight

1103
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,466
years. And at the end of these eight

1104
01:29:37,566 --> 01:29:41,400
years, the government reached the conclusion that there

1105
01:29:41,433 --> 01:29:47,066
was nothing wrong. "He's good. It's okay." In the meantime,

1106
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:53,633
his corporate bank accounts were frozen. His business died.

1107
01:29:55,933 --> 01:30:00,033
The only reason why he was able

1108
01:30:02,066 --> 01:30:05,766
to retain sanity is because he moved to Dubai and started a new

1109
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,600
company, which is incredibly successful, and now he's

1110
01:30:10,066 --> 01:30:16,066
enriching this city, which we're in right now, with his great ideas and creativity.

1111
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,666
- And by the way, having interacted with him, there's like a

1112
01:30:20,933 --> 01:30:23,833
fire in his eyes, the human spirit that fuels

1113
01:30:23,866 --> 01:30:27,633
entrepreneurship. Whatever that is, he doesn't have to do. He's made a lot of

1114
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:31,533
money. He probably doesn't have to do anything, but he still wants to create.

1115
01:30:31,633 --> 01:30:35,433
And that fire's what fuels great nations. Build, build, build,

1116
01:30:35,466 --> 01:30:40,100
build new stuff, expand, all of that, and regulation suffocates that.

1117
01:30:40,133 --> 01:30:41,500
- You have to cherish those people.

1118
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:46,200
But I guess the French public, or some part of the French public, was

1119
01:30:46,233 --> 01:30:50,133
misled, and I don't know when, perhaps since

1120
01:30:50,166 --> 01:30:53,233
the time of the French Revolution, to believe

1121
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:59,333
that entrepreneurs are somehow their enemies. They're the evil rich people

1122
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:05,433
that are the cause of all problems, as if only you could

1123
01:31:06,833 --> 01:31:12,966
make the rich share their ill-gotten wealth with the rest

1124
01:31:13,866 --> 01:31:16,666
of the population, then every problem will be magically

1125
01:31:16,733 --> 01:31:20,700
solved. In reality though, a lot of these people, that are

1126
01:31:20,733 --> 01:31:24,666
starting such companies with fire in their eyes, are

1127
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,766
sacrificing their lives, their livelihood. They're working 20 hours

1128
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:35,966
a day. They're experiencing immense stress in order to fulfill their vision

1129
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:40,866
and bring value and good to the society around them. They

1130
01:31:40,966 --> 01:31:44,333
create jobs. They create great services. They create great

1131
01:31:44,433 --> 01:31:48,000
goods. They make your country grow. They make your people

1132
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:52,100
proud. You have to cherish them. But

1133
01:31:52,133 --> 01:31:59,900
what does the system do to them? It squeezes them out, because, perhaps there

1134
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:09,066
was somebody in the tax authority that decided to advance their career, and

1135
01:32:09,133 --> 01:32:12,600
perhaps, you know, was too ambitious and not too

1136
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:15,466
smart, so as a result, the company was

1137
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:19,266
destroyed. And now the same entrepreneur, by the way, who we

1138
01:32:19,366 --> 01:32:23,300
talked to, is invited to come back to France. He's

1139
01:32:23,366 --> 01:32:26,866
being offered really good terms. He said, "Are you gonna open this new

1140
01:32:26,966 --> 01:32:30,366
venue on the Champs-Élysées? We're gonna give you the best

1141
01:32:30,433 --> 01:32:34,266
location. We're gonna fund part of it, tax breaks."

1142
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:38,266
And he said, "Never. Just forget about it."

1143
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:41,766
"It's impossible. I'm not coming back to France."

1144
01:32:41,866 --> 01:32:45,766
He's traumatized by the experience, and he's French. He was

1145
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:49,400
born there. He has a French passport. So,

1146
01:32:49,466 --> 01:32:53,300
unless things like this change, France will,

1147
01:32:53,366 --> 01:32:57,533
and the rest of Europe, will keep struggling with economic growth,

1148
01:32:58,533 --> 01:33:04,966
with budget deficits, with unemployment, and all the other relevant social and

1149
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,333
economic metrics.

1150
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:10,333
- Yeah, it's heartbreaking. As many of these nations, I

1151
01:33:10,366 --> 01:33:14,300
appreciate the historic and the cultural value, and I hope Europe

1152
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:19,333
and France flourish, but these are not the components required for

1153
01:33:19,366 --> 01:33:26,133
flourishing. Quick pause, I need a bathroom break. All right, we had

1154
01:33:26,133 --> 01:33:29,966
some tea. We're back.

1155
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,966
Let's go back a bunch of years to the beginning. You mentioned you went

1156
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,833
to school with a super intensive education. So, I thought it'd be really

1157
01:33:37,866 --> 01:33:41,566
interesting to look at some of the powerful aspects of that

1158
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:44,433
education, from the languages to the math. Can you actually

1159
01:33:44,466 --> 01:33:48,466
describe some of the rigorous aspects of it and what you gained from it?

1160
01:33:48,466 --> 01:33:52,266
- At the age of 11, I got the opportunity to enter

1161
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:56,566
an experimental school in St. Petersburg where I

1162
01:33:56,566 --> 01:34:01,100
lived, and we had to pass a rigorous test to get accepted.

1163
01:34:02,166 --> 01:34:09,733
The idea behind the school was that if you try to squeeze as

1164
01:34:09,766 --> 01:34:16,100
much information as possible into a brain of a teenager,

1165
01:34:16,366 --> 01:34:23,266
making a focus on math and foreign languages, then there will be

1166
01:34:23,433 --> 01:34:27,266
some changes in the brain of the student that will

1167
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:34,566
allow the student to understand most other disciplines. But we had a

1168
01:34:34,666 --> 01:34:38,533
class as a result that didn't have any single focus. It was

1169
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,800
very widespread across a lot of disciplines.

1170
01:34:42,866 --> 01:34:48,433
You would have at least four foreign languages, including Latin, English, French,

1171
01:34:48,733 --> 01:34:52,066
German. In addition, you can get Ancient

1172
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:58,766
Greek. You would have classes like biochemistry or psychoanalysis, evolutionary

1173
01:34:58,766 --> 01:35:05,866
psychology. The difference of this class as opposed to other classes in the

1174
01:35:05,933 --> 01:35:09,166
same school, which was part of the Saint Petersburg State University

1175
01:35:10,233 --> 01:35:12,333
and called Academic Gymnasium, was that

1176
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:17,166
unlike other classes, which were specialized in some

1177
01:35:18,233 --> 01:35:24,733
single subject like physics or math or history, this one tried to get

1178
01:35:26,666 --> 01:35:30,633
the best from all of these specialized classes and bring it into

1179
01:35:30,733 --> 01:35:38,366
one curriculum. Since it was an experimental class, it

1180
01:35:38,466 --> 01:35:43,633
wasn't possible to become a straight-A student, to be excellent in all the

1181
01:35:43,666 --> 01:35:48,666
subjects. It was considered crazy to even try.

1182
01:35:48,733 --> 01:35:52,066
- So just assume nobody's able to handle it, you're just pushing the limits of the human

1183
01:35:52,133 --> 01:35:55,733
mind. Four languages in parallel, math,

1184
01:35:55,766 --> 01:35:59,666
evolutionary psychology, just overwhelming the mind and see what happens.

1185
01:35:59,766 --> 01:36:02,333
- Yes, see what happens. This was an experiment.

1186
01:36:02,666 --> 01:36:05,200
And it was in the middle of the '90s, remember, when

1187
01:36:06,366 --> 01:36:09,766
Russia, particularly its educational system, wasn't

1188
01:36:09,966 --> 01:36:13,533
regulated as much as it is today. It was

1189
01:36:15,666 --> 01:36:19,033
in the middle between the two stages of the Russian

1190
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:23,033
history, the Soviet's history and the modern Russian history

1191
01:36:23,833 --> 01:36:32,833
of the 21st century. In any case, I learned a lot from that experience. First of

1192
01:36:32,866 --> 01:36:36,766
all, why I got into this course is because I kept being

1193
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,533
kicked out from other schools.

1194
01:36:38,566 --> 01:36:39,833
- Challenging authority?

1195
01:36:39,866 --> 01:36:43,466
- I was good at all subjects, but not behavior, you know. We had this

1196
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,233
behavior grade in the Soviet Union, in early

1197
01:36:48,233 --> 01:36:51,633
'90s. Perhaps they even have it today, I'm not

1198
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:55,600
sure. I was very bad at behavior. Always

1199
01:36:55,666 --> 01:36:59,166
challenging the teachers, always pointing out their mistakes.

1200
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:02,000
- By the way, that's not such a bad thing, right? Like, if you were looking

1201
01:37:02,033 --> 01:37:05,666
back, there's some value to that, right? For young people

1202
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:14,166
to, maybe respectfully, but challenge the authority, the wisdom of old, right?

1203
01:37:14,333 --> 01:37:19,466
- I think I was very lucky to be able to do that

1204
01:37:19,566 --> 01:37:22,933
and to be able to get away with it in the end.

1205
01:37:22,933 --> 01:37:26,066
Because normally if you keep challenging authorities,

1206
01:37:27,533 --> 01:37:31,266
you just get kicked out of all schools, and then you end up

1207
01:37:31,333 --> 01:37:34,866
nowhere. So I eventually got into a school where

1208
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:39,833
challenging teachers was not fully okay, but

1209
01:37:39,866 --> 01:37:43,666
it was something that you could do and then you would start a

1210
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:50,466
debate with the teacher, and normally they would allow you to express your point of

1211
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:55,166
view, and then some objective truth may come out of it as a result.

1212
01:37:58,333 --> 01:38:01,966
But at that point, I was pretty bored with my life, you

1213
01:38:02,033 --> 01:38:05,633
know? Every teenager gets to a point when they have this sort of

1214
01:38:05,666 --> 01:38:11,533
existential crisis. What's the point of life? What am I even doing here?

1215
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:18,700
At some point, I decided since I have to go to school anyway,

1216
01:38:20,133 --> 01:38:23,633
I might as well try to do something impossible and become the best

1217
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:29,866
student and get an A, or what we called five in the Russian system,

1218
01:38:31,766 --> 01:38:38,166
on every single subject. And that kept me busy for a while.

1219
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:46,933
It was incredibly difficult because you didn't have enough time.

1220
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:50,400
Even if you just studied all the time,

1221
01:38:51,566 --> 01:38:57,233
not doing anything else, you didn't have any time left to prepare all the homework

1222
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:02,100
tasks and get ready for all the tests. So I

1223
01:39:02,133 --> 01:39:07,333
ended up using the breaks between classes, but I got to

1224
01:39:08,233 --> 01:39:12,633
the result I wanted to get to. I got the excellent

1225
01:39:14,033 --> 01:39:19,633
mark in every subject, and that kept me happy for a while.

1226
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:20,666
- What did you understand about

1227
01:39:21,766 --> 01:39:25,066
an effective education system from studying foreign languages at the same time,

1228
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:29,766
doing such a diversity? Like, if you were to design an education system from scratch

1229
01:39:30,633 --> 01:39:34,333
for young people, especially in the 21st century, what would that look

1230
01:39:34,433 --> 01:39:39,433
like? You posted about the value of mathematics as a foundation for everything.

1231
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:43,400
- Yeah, I still think math is essential. It's something that

1232
01:39:43,466 --> 01:39:51,266
shapes your brain. It teaches you to rely on your logical thinking to split big

1233
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:58,500
problems into smaller parts, put them in the right sequence, solve them patiently,

1234
01:39:59,966 --> 01:40:03,733
trying again if it doesn't work. And this is exactly the

1235
01:40:03,833 --> 01:40:07,166
same skill you need in programming,

1236
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,033
in project management, and start it when you start your own company.

1237
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:19,166
And it's one of the few subjects in school which encourages you to

1238
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:25,633
develop your own thinking as opposed to rely on

1239
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:32,833
what other people have to say and just repeating their opinions. That is extremely

1240
01:40:32,866 --> 01:40:40,200
valuable. And of course, once you're good at math, you can apply it in physics, in

1241
01:40:40,266 --> 01:40:46,266
engineering, in coding. And it's not surprising there that

1242
01:40:47,566 --> 01:40:53,433
most of the most successful tech founders and CEOs are very good at math and coding

1243
01:40:54,633 --> 01:41:05,733
because ultimately, it's the same mental skill that you rely on. But

1244
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,866
back then in the school, I realized something else as well: it's that

1245
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:20,700
competition is really important. Competition is key. This is what motivates a lot

1246
01:41:20,733 --> 01:41:22,600
of teenagers

1247
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:30,000
when they're at school. And if you remove competition out of the education

1248
01:41:30,066 --> 01:41:36,933
system, you will end up forcing kids to start competing elsewhere, for

1249
01:41:36,933 --> 01:41:39,700
example, in video games.

1250
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:43,733
It's a trend you see now in many countries, including in the West,

1251
01:41:45,133 --> 01:41:49,000
when well-meaning authorities or parents say, "We don't want our

1252
01:41:49,033 --> 01:41:55,966
kids to be too stressed. We don't want them to feel anxiety. So let's just get rid

1253
01:41:56,033 --> 01:42:00,300
of all the public grading system, all these

1254
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:04,433
rankings of who won, who lost. We don't want any

1255
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:08,966
of that." And part of it is justified, but as a result,

1256
01:42:11,733 --> 01:42:15,633
some kids lose interest. Yes, you

1257
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:21,666
eliminate the losers, but you end up eliminating the winners as well.

1258
01:42:22,666 --> 01:42:31,100
And then if you're overprotective of the kids in that age, they grow up,

1259
01:42:32,233 --> 01:42:36,133
graduate schools or universities, and they are still not prepared for real

1260
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:41,466
life because real life is constant competition for jobs, for promotions,

1261
01:42:43,133 --> 01:42:49,433
for customers, and it's more brutal. What you have as a result is

1262
01:42:49,533 --> 01:42:53,266
high suicide rates, high unemployment, all the

1263
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,333
things and negative trends you see now in many

1264
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:01,900
countries which thought eliminating competition from their education systems

1265
01:43:02,833 --> 01:43:03,566
was a good idea,

1266
01:43:05,933 --> 01:43:09,700
they still persist. They still think competition's a bad thing. They try to

1267
01:43:09,733 --> 01:43:15,800
eliminate competition from their economy as well to an extent, saying, "We're gonna

1268
01:43:16,900 --> 01:43:26,966
make sure the losers don't lose and the winners don't get too much."

1269
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,233
But as a result, they make their entire systems less

1270
01:43:30,266 --> 01:43:34,866
competitive, their entire economies. Some of them in Europe

1271
01:43:36,466 --> 01:43:41,400
are now struggling to keep up with China, with South

1272
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:45,333
Korea, with Singapore, with Japan, and other places

1273
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:53,433
where the education system was based on ruthless competition. So this is a hard

1274
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,166
choice any civilization has to make.

1275
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:02,133
We support competition, understanding that eventually it leads to

1276
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:08,533
progress in science and technology and abundance for society at large.

1277
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:15,066
Or we remove competition thinking that somehow we can shield the future generations

1278
01:44:16,233 --> 01:44:21,833
from the stress that competition inevitably causes.

1279
01:44:22,266 --> 01:44:26,200
- Yeah, I mean, it's grounded in a good instinct of compassion. You don't want people

1280
01:44:26,266 --> 01:44:30,100
who are, who suck at a thing to feel pain, but it seems like

1281
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:33,200
struggle is a part of life. Either you do it early or you do it later.

1282
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:38,300
And it's true, that's such a good point that competition does

1283
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:41,533
seem to be a really powerful driver of skill

1284
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:45,533
development, like you mentioned, pursuing mastery.

1285
01:44:46,433 --> 01:44:49,600
There's something in human nature that, especially for young

1286
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:53,566
people, if you can compete at a thing, you're gonna be really driven to

1287
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:57,533
get good at that thing. If you can direct that in the education system as China does, as

1288
01:44:57,566 --> 01:45:01,333
many, as many nations like you mentioned do, then you're going to

1289
01:45:01,366 --> 01:45:05,200
develop a lot of brilliant people, resilient people, people that

1290
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,300
are ready to create epic stuff in the world.

1291
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:11,366
- I think there is a lot of evidence proving that we are biologically

1292
01:45:11,433 --> 01:45:17,400
wired to compete and establish our understanding of

1293
01:45:19,133 --> 01:45:25,300
what our qualities are and talents are in relation to other people around us.

1294
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:30,300
And this is one of the ways society self-regulates.

1295
01:45:30,433 --> 01:45:34,166
- Speaking of competition, your brother, Nikolai,

1296
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:40,633
he's a mathematician, programmer, expert in cryptography. He has won the IMO,

1297
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,433
International Mathematics Olympiad. He got gold medal three

1298
01:45:44,533 --> 01:45:51,566
times, ICPC Programming two times, has two PhDs in mathematics.

1299
01:45:51,633 --> 01:45:55,233
And you have worked together for many years, creating incredible

1300
01:45:55,266 --> 01:45:59,433
technologies that we've been talking about. So what have you learned about

1301
01:46:00,366 --> 01:46:02,300
just life from your brother?

1302
01:46:02,333 --> 01:46:05,800
- Well, first of all, I must say I learned pretty much

1303
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:12,433
everything from my brother, everything I know. Because when we used to be kids,

1304
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:18,366
we slept in the same bedroom, like beds a few feet away from each other.

1305
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:26,800
and I kept bugging him with questions. I would ask him about dinosaurs and

1306
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:31,866
galaxies and black holes and Neanderthals,

1307
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:36,733
everything I could think of, and he was my Wikipedia

1308
01:46:37,466 --> 01:46:41,400
back in the time when we didn't have internet access. He's a

1309
01:46:41,500 --> 01:46:45,366
unique prodigy kid, probably one in a billion.

1310
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:49,766
He started reading at the age of three, I think, and

1311
01:46:49,866 --> 01:46:53,866
he pretty fast got so advanced in math that

1312
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:57,766
by the age of six, he could already read really sophisticated

1313
01:46:57,966 --> 01:47:03,366
books on astronomy. Sometimes when he did it in public places like

1314
01:47:04,433 --> 01:47:12,333
buses or metro, my mom was criticized by people who were witnessing it.

1315
01:47:13,166 --> 01:47:16,800
They would tell her, "Why are you mocking your own kid with this

1316
01:47:16,866 --> 01:47:20,700
serious book? It's obvious the kid can't understand

1317
01:47:20,766 --> 01:47:24,666
everything there. It's too complicated. Even we don't understand anything there.

1318
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:28,866
There are some formulas." And he was already

1319
01:47:31,233 --> 01:47:36,766
sucking in this knowledge. He just has this thirst for

1320
01:47:36,800 --> 01:47:42,166
information. So, he was the source of all kinds of

1321
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:48,900
great facts, useful things, inspiring things.

1322
01:47:50,133 --> 01:47:53,400
He taught me pretty much everything I know. At the same

1323
01:47:53,433 --> 01:47:59,933
time, he is incredibly modest and kind, and this is

1324
01:48:01,066 --> 01:48:04,400
something I think a lot of people

1325
01:48:05,733 --> 01:48:09,733
that think they're smart but not genuinely intelligent, lack.

1326
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:16,366
More often than not, people who are truly intelligent, they're also kind

1327
01:48:17,166 --> 01:48:18,866
and compassionate.

1328
01:48:18,866 --> 01:48:20,466
- And he is that.

1329
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,866
- Definitely.

1330
01:48:22,066 --> 01:48:25,966
- You actually have been staying out of the public eye for the most part. You've done very

1331
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,733
few interviews. You're pretty low-key. But your brother is on

1332
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:34,233
another level. He's been staying out of the public eye. What's behind that?

1333
01:48:34,266 --> 01:48:40,600
- Part of it is his natural modesty. He doesn't need to do it.

1334
01:48:42,766 --> 01:48:48,200
He doesn't feel this urge to show off, brag about stuff.

1335
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:53,266
I tried to avoid it as well, but at a certain point, I realized that

1336
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:57,233
me being too private, too secretive,

1337
01:48:57,933 --> 01:49:02,733
becomes a liability because it creates this void, this emptiness that

1338
01:49:06,033 --> 01:49:11,033
people and organizations that don't like Telegram very much are willing to fill

1339
01:49:11,933 --> 01:49:15,666
with inaccurate information, and they're willing to spread narratives

1340
01:49:15,866 --> 01:49:19,666
about Telegram, which can result in

1341
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:27,800
strange situations, some of which we discussed earlier,

1342
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,400
for example, this French investigation.

1343
01:49:32,466 --> 01:49:36,266
- Yeah. I've gotten to know you more and more, and there's a deep

1344
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:40,166
integrity to you that I think is good to show to the

1345
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:44,133
world. There's a lot of attack vectors on user privacy, and I

1346
01:49:44,133 --> 01:49:45,766
think the most important, the last

1347
01:49:47,166 --> 01:49:51,133
wall of protection is the actual people that are running the company.

1348
01:49:51,166 --> 01:49:54,500
So it's important to some degree for you to be out there, showing your true self.

1349
01:49:55,233 --> 01:49:59,600
So we should say that also you didn't mention, but you're a programmer

1350
01:50:00,700 --> 01:50:04,566
From an early age, you started coding at 10. First things you

1351
01:50:04,666 --> 01:50:08,300
built were a video game at 11, and then

1352
01:50:08,366 --> 01:50:12,066
eventually 10 years later, at 21, you programmed the initial versions of

1353
01:50:12,100 --> 01:50:15,966
VK single-handedly. Can you talk to me about your programming

1354
01:50:16,033 --> 01:50:19,300
journey that led to the creation of VK? What was the VK

1355
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:25,300
stack? Was it PHP mostly? How did you figure out how to program websites,

1356
01:50:26,133 --> 01:50:26,666
all of that?

1357
01:50:27,466 --> 01:50:31,333
- I wasn't interested in programming websites at first. I didn't even have access to

1358
01:50:31,966 --> 01:50:35,766
the internet when I was 10 years old. But I liked video

1359
01:50:35,866 --> 01:50:43,500
games. I didn't have enough of them, and the scarcity forced me to start

1360
01:50:43,533 --> 01:50:47,566
building them, more computer games just to play myself.

1361
01:50:49,266 --> 01:50:51,333
It's actually an interesting thing that

1362
01:50:52,866 --> 01:50:55,800
we sometimes don't realize it, but scarcity leads to

1363
01:50:55,866 --> 01:51:01,100
creativity, and one of the reasons you have so many people who love to

1364
01:51:02,266 --> 01:51:07,566
code coming from the Soviet Union or other places which

1365
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:13,200
didn't have much access to modern technology, and more importantly, modern

1366
01:51:13,366 --> 01:51:22,300
entertainment, is that perhaps we were not so much distracted by all this abundance

1367
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:27,166
of different entertainment options, which is not to say it's bad to

1368
01:51:27,200 --> 01:51:31,200
have those options. It's just a fact

1369
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:35,966
that we sometimes don't appreciate. So I started to build computer games.

1370
01:51:37,633 --> 01:51:42,633
My brother would sometimes guide me. For example, I would create this turn-based

1371
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,766
strategy, of course two-dimensional. Back then, three-dimensional was too much for

1372
01:51:48,833 --> 01:52:00,133
me. But it wasn't as slick in terms of the scrolling FPS, frames per second,

1373
01:52:01,133 --> 01:52:06,400
parameter, and asked my brother how to optimize it.

1374
01:52:06,466 --> 01:52:12,600
He would guide me, and this kind of learning and

1375
01:52:14,766 --> 01:52:21,766
training really shaped my coding skills when I was younger. Then I started to

1376
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:25,633
create video games for my classmates. When we

1377
01:52:25,700 --> 01:52:29,633
played, for example, tic-tac-toe on an infinite field in

1378
01:52:29,700 --> 01:52:34,500
my class during the breaks, you know, and not tic-tac-toe, the three in a row.

1379
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:38,566
This was a bit five in a row, and an infinite field.

1380
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,433
This is a much more interesting game,

1381
01:52:41,466 --> 01:52:44,600
and it gets quite complicated if you keep playing

1382
01:52:44,633 --> 01:52:48,400
it. My classmates used to love it, and some of my

1383
01:52:48,433 --> 01:52:51,933
classmates were really smart, you know, champions of math

1384
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:55,466
Olympians, sons and daughters of professors at the

1385
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:59,000
university, and I decided, "No, I want to win every single time."

1386
01:53:00,166 --> 01:53:03,666
I don't want to lose even a single time, so how do I win? I need to practice

1387
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:07,400
more. But how do I practice more? I need an opponent stronger than

1388
01:53:07,433 --> 01:53:11,300
myself. So, I coded this game so that I would

1389
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:15,300
play against the computer, and the computer would

1390
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:21,533
calculate, I think, four moves in advance to choose the optimal

1391
01:53:21,666 --> 01:53:25,533
strategy. That wasn't enough, four moves

1392
01:53:25,666 --> 01:53:29,000
in advance. I would still win over it. If I tried to

1393
01:53:29,333 --> 01:53:33,266
calculate five or six, it was too slow. So, I asked my brother, "Help

1394
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:39,666
me out here." So, he made this algorithm. Eventually, I

1395
01:53:41,833 --> 01:53:45,766
trained myself to win every single time, even with the computer back

1396
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:53,466
then. We didn't have modern CPUs and I could still retain some

1397
01:53:53,533 --> 01:54:00,300
self-confidence. I would go back to school during breaks, play with my classmates, and

1398
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:04,400
soon people started to lose interest. None of my classmates wanted

1399
01:54:04,433 --> 01:54:13,233
to play this game anymore. I killed the game. There's no- So after that, when I

1400
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,333
got into St. Petersburg State University,

1401
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:22,866
it was quite boring just to study because it was too easy.

1402
01:54:22,933 --> 01:54:26,633
So, I thought, "What can I do there?" I created a website for the

1403
01:54:26,733 --> 01:54:34,800
students of my faculty first. I organized the creation of digital

1404
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:42,533
answers to all exams and a digitized version of all lectures, which was

1405
01:54:42,633 --> 01:54:48,433
something very unique back then. Remember, it was 25 years ago.

1406
01:54:49,966 --> 01:54:54,800
I would put together a website where I would

1407
01:54:55,733 --> 01:54:59,866
publish all these materials, and pretty soon it became super popular.

1408
01:55:01,066 --> 01:55:05,000
I opened a discussion forum there. In a few years, I expanded

1409
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:10,233
to the university with all of its other

1410
01:55:10,333 --> 01:55:14,566
departments, and then to other universities. We ended up having

1411
01:55:16,433 --> 01:55:22,866
tens of thousands of users just as a student support tool. We had all kinds of

1412
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:31,033
social features there: friends lists, photo albums, profiles, blogs, all of it. It was

1413
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:35,833
quite successful, and after I graduated the university,

1414
01:55:36,633 --> 01:55:39,933
one of my ex-classmates from the school

1415
01:55:40,633 --> 01:55:44,433
reached out to me after reading about my successes in

1416
01:55:44,533 --> 01:55:48,066
a newspaper, the main business newspaper of St.

1417
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:50,800
Petersburg, and he asked me, "Are you trying to build

1418
01:55:51,833 --> 01:55:58,766
a Russian Facebook?" I said, "I'm not sure. What's Facebook?" So, we

1419
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:02,666
met. He, since he graduated in American

1420
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,566
university two years before that, he showed me Facebook. I thought,

1421
01:56:07,566 --> 01:56:13,500
"Well, I kind of already have all of this technology, but it's valuable to know

1422
01:56:14,633 --> 01:56:19,600
which elements I should get rid of in order to scale this thing

1423
01:56:21,233 --> 01:56:27,866
and have millions of users." This is also something people don't appreciate that

1424
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:34,100
sometimes in order to move forward and have more success, you have to

1425
01:56:35,033 --> 01:56:39,933
get rid of things, including technology. Getting rid of features is super important.

1426
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,266
- Simplify, both for scaling and for making it

1427
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:50,733
amenable to just growing the user base where people get it immediately.

1428
01:56:50,833 --> 01:56:54,600
- Yes. Otherwise, it's just too complicated for the new user. The

1429
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:57,900
existing users will be happy. They'll be praising you. They'll

1430
01:56:57,933 --> 01:57:04,533
be asking you to add more stuff to make it even more complicated. So, it's easy to

1431
01:57:06,733 --> 01:57:15,566
lose track and get disoriented if you are only relying on the feedback of existing

1432
01:57:15,666 --> 01:57:23,233
users. As a result, I started the website called Vkontakte, or

1433
01:57:23,300 --> 01:57:27,200
VK. It means "in touch" in Russian. Initially to

1434
01:57:27,266 --> 01:57:31,033
solve my own personal problem, I graduated the

1435
01:57:31,066 --> 01:57:34,533
university that same year and I wanted to be in touch, remain in

1436
01:57:34,633 --> 01:57:38,600
touch with my ex-classmates from the university and other fellow students. And of course, as a 20-year-old,

1437
01:57:38,633 --> 01:57:42,633
other fellow students. And of course, as a 20-year-old,

1438
01:57:42,766 --> 01:57:46,733
I wanted to meet other people, including good-looking girls.

1439
01:57:46,766 --> 01:57:50,500
So, I started to build it from scratch. For that one

1440
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:55,733
I thought, "I'm not going to use any third-party libraries,

1441
01:57:56,633 --> 01:58:02,833
modules because I want to make it as efficient as possible." I was obsessing

1442
01:58:02,933 --> 01:58:06,800
over every line of code. But then how

1443
01:58:06,866 --> 01:58:10,433
do you start something that large? Like, I didn't have any

1444
01:58:10,766 --> 01:58:17,133
prior experience of creating a project of that scale, which would involve

1445
01:58:17,200 --> 01:58:23,600
everything. Before, I would reuse some existing

1446
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:28,300
solutions. Here, I wanted to build from scratch, so I called my brother.

1447
01:58:29,733 --> 01:58:33,533
He was a postdoc student in Germany at the

1448
01:58:33,666 --> 01:58:37,533
time in the Max Planck University, and I asked him,

1449
01:58:38,866 --> 01:58:45,100
"What should I start from?" And he told me, "Just build

1450
01:58:47,100 --> 01:58:53,600
a module to authorize users." Just not a way to log in, you know?

1451
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,766
Not even to sign up, just to log in,

1452
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:01,933
because you can pre-populate the database with credentials and emails

1453
01:59:01,933 --> 01:59:06,100
and passwords. It doesn't really matter, but once you see that you can

1454
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:12,400
type in your password and email and you're in, and it tells you "hello"

1455
01:59:13,333 --> 01:59:21,566
using your name. Then you will have a clear understanding where to go from there.

1456
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:24,266
- Yeah, I mean, that's true.

1457
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:28,300
- That's one of the best advice I've ever got in my life.

1458
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:33,000
It worked perfectly, by the way. I started to build it and before I knew it,

1459
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:37,833
there on that website, photo albums, private

1460
01:59:37,866 --> 01:59:40,833
messages. This guest book we used to call "the wall"

1461
01:59:41,633 --> 01:59:46,033
back on VK and, I guess, in the early days of Facebook,

1462
01:59:47,033 --> 01:59:50,666
we ended up building something even more sophisticated

1463
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:53,033
than Facebook at the time, with more

1464
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:57,100
features. I had a girlfriend at the time, I asked her, "We need to

1465
01:59:58,200 --> 02:00:04,733
somehow come up with a database of all Russian schools and

1466
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:10,600
universities and their departments and subdivisions." She did a great job

1467
02:00:10,633 --> 02:00:14,333
trying to source all this information online or sometimes writing

1468
02:00:14,466 --> 02:00:17,800
emails to universities saying, "Which departments do you have

1469
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:21,900
exactly at this point? We need to know," or

1470
02:00:21,933 --> 02:00:24,066
reaching out to the Department of Education,

1471
02:00:25,366 --> 02:00:27,733
both in Russia and then in Ukraine, and then

1472
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:33,500
eventually in Belarus, in Kazakhstan, and other countries where VK ended up

1473
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:40,900
to be the largest and most popular social network. So we did a few things that were

1474
02:00:42,233 --> 02:00:50,066
quite unique at the time, and for the first almost a year, I was the single

1475
02:00:50,333 --> 02:00:55,633
employee of the company. I was the backend engineer, the frontend

1476
02:00:55,700 --> 02:01:02,933
engineer, the designer. I was the customer support officer.

1477
02:01:03,866 --> 02:01:07,800
I was the marketing guy as well, coming

1478
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:10,600
up with all the wordings and the announcements,

1479
02:01:12,066 --> 02:01:15,266
coming up with competitions to promote

1480
02:01:15,333 --> 02:01:20,266
VK, which worked quite well. That was an incredible experience that

1481
02:01:22,633 --> 02:01:30,033
gave me knowledge of every aspect of a social networking platform.

1482
02:01:30,100 --> 02:01:32,666
- Also, an understanding of how much a single person can do.

1483
02:01:32,733 --> 02:01:36,700
- Exactly. It's one of the reasons why I like to think I'm an

1484
02:01:36,733 --> 02:01:44,333
efficient project manager and product manager inside Telegram, because

1485
02:01:45,633 --> 02:01:55,800
I will not take anything but ambitious deadlines from my team members. If somebody

1486
02:01:56,900 --> 02:02:00,800
gives me, "Oh, I need three weeks to do that." I would reply, "Well, I

1487
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:04,000
built the first version of VK in just two weeks. Why would you need three

1488
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:08,000
weeks? It seems like something you could

1489
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:13,600
make real in just three days. Three weeks? What are you

1490
02:02:13,633 --> 02:02:17,066
going to do the rest of the three weeks apart from those three days?"

1491
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:22,133
And, you know, the team knows me, and that's why

1492
02:02:22,233 --> 02:02:26,666
we are able, today at Telegram, to move at a very good

1493
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:32,100
pace of innovation every month. We're pushing

1494
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:38,600
several meaningful features, I think, out-competing everybody else in this

1495
02:02:39,600 --> 02:02:43,300
industry in terms of what you can do

1496
02:02:44,266 --> 02:02:48,400
within a short timeframe. So yes, that experience was

1497
02:02:49,366 --> 02:02:54,900
invaluable. As for the stack, I started from

1498
02:02:55,733 --> 02:03:02,200
PHP and MySQL, Debian Linux, but very soon I

1499
02:03:02,233 --> 02:03:07,366
realized I needed to optimize this. I started using

1500
02:03:07,433 --> 02:03:15,033
Memcached. Apache servers were not enough anymore. We had to set up NGINX,

1501
02:03:15,033 --> 02:03:18,966
and my brother was still living in Germany, so he couldn't help me much

1502
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:24,200
for the first year of building VK. Sometimes I would manage to get through

1503
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:29,700
to him through a call. I would use an old-school phone to call him with wires

1504
02:03:30,966 --> 02:03:34,366
and say, "What do I do? How do I install this thing called NGINX? I'm not a

1505
02:03:34,466 --> 02:03:38,600
Linux guy." If he felt

1506
02:03:39,633 --> 02:03:43,433
particularly kind that day and not too busy, he would show me the way to do it

1507
02:03:43,466 --> 02:03:51,166
or set it up himself, but for the most part, I had to rely on just myself.

1508
02:03:53,166 --> 02:03:59,000
Having him there, though, helped when we started to grow fast and scale

1509
02:03:59,033 --> 02:04:02,200
it, because at first

1510
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:07,900
you realize, "Right now, one server is not enough. I need to buy another one,

1511
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:12,433
then another one and another one. The database should

1512
02:04:12,500 --> 02:04:16,266
be in a different server. Then you have to

1513
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:20,233
split the database into tables. Then you have to come up with a

1514
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,633
way to shard the tables using some

1515
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:26,733
criteria that would make sense, that wouldn't break your user

1516
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,266
experience. When we got to over a million

1517
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:34,200
users and beyond, a dozen servers surviving

1518
02:04:34,233 --> 02:04:38,133
without the input from my brother in terms of taking

1519
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:45,000
care of the scaling aspect of it, became impossible. I remember asking him to come

1520
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:49,000
back. I said, "You need to help me with this thing. It's starting

1521
02:04:49,033 --> 02:04:53,166
to be really big." What was worse is that

1522
02:04:54,033 --> 02:04:57,966
since we became popular, somebody started to

1523
02:04:58,066 --> 02:05:01,700
do DDoS attacks on us, as it always happens.

1524
02:05:02,166 --> 02:05:03,166
- Right.

1525
02:05:03,166 --> 02:05:07,500
- And then we had people that wanted to buy a share of VK.

1526
02:05:08,433 --> 02:05:14,166
And interestingly, every time we had a negotiation day, the DDoS attacks

1527
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:21,066
intensified. So we had to come up with a way to

1528
02:05:22,366 --> 02:05:30,066
fight it. I remember having many sleepless nights trying to figure it out.

1529
02:05:30,100 --> 02:05:34,400
- So that was your introduction to all kinds of bad actors, DDoS,

1530
02:05:35,533 --> 02:05:40,566
business. Then later you'd find out there's such a thing called politics,

1531
02:05:41,466 --> 02:05:49,000
and then later geopolitics. But this is the initial stages. That it's not just

1532
02:05:49,033 --> 02:05:52,900
about creating cool stuff. It's having to deal with,

1533
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,900
as you now have to deal with with Telegram, is seas of bad

1534
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:02,366
actors trying to test the limits of the system, trying to break the system.

1535
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:06,866
- Unfortunately, if we didn't have bad actors and pressure,

1536
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:12,066
it would be the best job ever. You just get to create.

1537
02:06:12,100 --> 02:06:15,966
- Yeah. Yeah. And so the help from

1538
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:21,466
your brother, like you mentioned, NGINX and sharding the tables, some of the scaling

1539
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,966
issue is algorithmic in nature. It's almost like theoretical computer

1540
02:06:26,033 --> 02:06:29,866
science. So it's not just about, like, buying more computers. It's figuring

1541
02:06:29,966 --> 02:06:39,166
out how to algorithmically make everything work extremely fast. So some of it is

1542
02:06:39,166 --> 02:06:44,466
mathematics. Some of it is pure engineering, but some of it is mathematics.

1543
02:06:44,533 --> 02:06:48,266
- Yeah, so at that stage I could do the basic stuff. I could

1544
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:56,066
understand how I implement scalability into the codebase, how I sharded my tables

1545
02:06:57,766 --> 02:07:03,666
in the database, where I include Memcached instead of direct

1546
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:09,333
requests to the database. That was quite easy

1547
02:07:10,266 --> 02:07:15,666
because it was still PHP back in the day. When my brother got back

1548
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,300
from Germany somewhere around 2008,

1549
02:07:22,633 --> 02:07:25,666
I asked him, "Can we make it even more efficient? Can we make it

1550
02:07:26,733 --> 02:07:30,033
super fast, and at the same time so that we would require even

1551
02:07:31,133 --> 02:07:34,933
fewer servers to maintain the load?" And he said, "Yes, but, you know,

1552
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:40,633
PHP is not enough. I'll have to rewrite a big part of your

1553
02:07:42,033 --> 02:07:47,933
data engines in C and C++. I said, "Okay, let's do that." He invited

1554
02:07:49,566 --> 02:07:56,166
a friend of his to help him, another absolute champion in world's

1555
02:07:56,200 --> 02:08:02,300
programming contest twice in a row, and they

1556
02:08:03,766 --> 02:08:07,466
they put together the first customized data engine, which

1557
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:14,066
was far more efficient than just relying on MySQL and Memcached, because it

1558
02:08:15,366 --> 02:08:19,566
was, first of all, more specialized, more low level.

1559
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:21,433
- So they rewrote it in C, C++?

1560
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:25,766
- A large chunk of it, like, for example, the search, the

1561
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:29,766
ad engine, because VK had targeted ads. They built

1562
02:08:29,766 --> 02:08:33,733
that. It was, it was very efficient what they did. Eventually

1563
02:08:33,766 --> 02:08:37,666
the private messaging part, the public messages part.

1564
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:47,566
At some point, we realized there are very few websites online that load faster than

1565
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:48,800
VK.

1566
02:08:48,900 --> 02:08:49,600
- Nice.

1567
02:08:49,733 --> 02:08:53,166
- I remember in 2009, I went to Silicon Valley

1568
02:08:53,966 --> 02:09:01,200
and I met Mark Zuckerberg the first time and some of the other core team members of,

1569
02:09:01,933 --> 02:09:04,266
of early Facebook. Remember, Facebook was just

1570
02:09:05,166 --> 02:09:09,000
four or five years old then. And everybody kept asking

1571
02:09:09,033 --> 02:09:12,700
me, "How come even here in Silicon Valley, VK loads

1572
02:09:12,766 --> 02:09:14,600
faster than Facebook? Everything seems to

1573
02:09:16,766 --> 02:09:19,900
appear instantly on your website. What's the secret

1574
02:09:19,933 --> 02:09:24,966
sauce?" It was one of the things that made them very curious.

1575
02:09:24,966 --> 02:09:28,900
- And that was always important to you to have very low latency to make sure the thing loads

1576
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:32,633
and... because that's one of the things Telegram is really known for. Even on

1577
02:09:32,766 --> 02:09:36,633
crappy connections and all that kind of stuff, it just works extremely fast. Everything is

1578
02:09:36,666 --> 02:09:37,600
fast.

1579
02:09:37,733 --> 02:09:43,000
- It's one of the core technological ideas. We prioritize

1580
02:09:43,066 --> 02:09:46,966
speed. We think that people can notice

1581
02:09:47,033 --> 02:09:50,700
the difference even if it's just, like, 50 millisecond

1582
02:09:50,766 --> 02:09:58,366
difference. The difference is subconscious. It also allows us not just to be faster

1583
02:09:58,766 --> 02:10:03,400
and more responsive, but also more efficient when it comes to

1584
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:06,700
the infrastructure, the expenses,

1585
02:10:07,666 --> 02:10:11,733
because if your code executes faster, it means you need fewer

1586
02:10:13,066 --> 02:10:16,800
computational resources to run it. So there is no

1587
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:20,433
way you can lose in making things faster, and that's why we have

1588
02:10:20,533 --> 02:10:28,233
always been very careful when hiring people. I would only hire a person if

1589
02:10:28,333 --> 02:10:34,433
I'm ultimately certain it's the best option. Because if you hire somebody who is

1590
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:41,200
maybe a little bit distracted, inexperienced, you may end up with

1591
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:45,666
inefficiencies in your codebase that results in tens of

1592
02:10:45,766 --> 02:10:49,200
millions of dollars of losses. And think about the

1593
02:10:49,233 --> 02:10:56,933
responsibility. If we jump to today from the VK days, Telegram is used by

1594
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:02,333
over a billion people. They open it dozens of times every day.

1595
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,933
Imagine the app opens with a slight delay, say half a

1596
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:14,666
second delay. Multiply it by dozens of times by a billion. It's...

1597
02:11:15,866 --> 02:11:20,300
centuries, millennia lost for humanity without any reason

1598
02:11:22,833 --> 02:11:24,633
other than just being sloppy.

1599
02:11:24,700 --> 02:11:27,900
- That is so important to understand and so wise,

1600
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:32,733
that if you're just a little bit careless as a developer,

1601
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:36,333
you can introduce inefficiencies that are going to be very difficult to track

1602
02:11:36,366 --> 02:11:40,333
down, because you don't know that it can be faster. The code doesn't

1603
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:44,333
scream at you, saying, "This could be much faster." So you have to actually, as

1604
02:11:44,366 --> 02:11:48,300
a craftsman, be very careful when you're writing the code

1605
02:11:48,333 --> 02:11:52,200
and always thinking, "Can this be done much more efficiently?" And it can

1606
02:11:52,233 --> 02:11:55,900
be tiny things, because they all propagate throughout the

1607
02:11:55,933 --> 02:11:59,766
code. And so there's a real cost in having a

1608
02:11:59,833 --> 02:12:03,300
careless developer anywhere in the company.

1609
02:12:03,766 --> 02:12:07,533
Because they can introduce that inefficiency, and all the other developers won't

1610
02:12:07,533 --> 02:12:11,933
know. They'll just assume it kind of has to be that way. And so

1611
02:12:13,300 --> 02:12:16,633
there's a real responsibility for every single individual developer that's

1612
02:12:16,633 --> 02:12:19,833
building any component of an app like Telegram

1613
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,133
to just always ask, you know, "Can this be done more

1614
02:12:24,133 --> 02:12:27,966
efficiently? Can this be done more simply?" And

1615
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,900
that's like one of the most beautiful aspects, the art forms of programming, right?

1616
02:12:32,966 --> 02:12:36,766
- Oh, yes, because when you manage to discover

1617
02:12:37,866 --> 02:12:44,733
a way to simplify things, make them more efficient, you feel incredibly happy.

1618
02:12:45,066 --> 02:12:48,733
...and proud and accomplished. And to your point, I

1619
02:12:48,833 --> 02:12:51,900
can recall a few instances in my career when

1620
02:12:53,733 --> 02:12:57,033
firing an engineer actually resulted in an increase in

1621
02:12:57,066 --> 02:13:03,066
productivity. Let's say you have 200 engineers building the app, and then

1622
02:13:04,833 --> 02:13:08,833
just... they just can't make it. They're not keeping up with

1623
02:13:08,866 --> 02:13:12,966
the pace of the feature release schedule, and

1624
02:13:15,033 --> 02:13:18,900
you think, "I probably have to hire a third one." But then you

1625
02:13:18,966 --> 02:13:25,933
notice that one of them is really weird, falling behind the schedule, complaining

1626
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,500
some of the time, doesn't assume responsibility.

1627
02:13:30,233 --> 02:13:32,833
And you ask, "So what if I just fire this person?" And you fire this

1628
02:13:32,833 --> 02:13:36,766
person. In a few weeks, you realize you

1629
02:13:36,833 --> 02:13:40,633
actually don't need, I mean, you never needed the third engineer.

1630
02:13:41,600 --> 02:13:49,666
The problem was this guy who created more issues and more problems than he solved.

1631
02:13:49,833 --> 02:13:55,400
That is so counterintuitive because, you know, in developing

1632
02:13:57,066 --> 02:14:01,033
tech projects we tend to think that you just throw more people into

1633
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:07,466
something and then things get solved miraculously by themselves just because

1634
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:12,133
more people means more attention from them. No.

1635
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:16,000
- That's, again, extremely powerful. The you know, Steve Jobs talked about A

1636
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:19,833
players and B players, and there's something that happens when you have

1637
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:23,433
B players, which is kind of like the folks you're talking about,

1638
02:14:23,800 --> 02:14:27,433
introduced into a team. They can somehow slow everybody down. They

1639
02:14:27,533 --> 02:14:31,033
demotivate everybody. And it's very counterintuitive.

1640
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:35,266
They basically... Part of the work of creating a great team

1641
02:14:36,233 --> 02:14:40,233
is removing the B players. It's not just hiring

1642
02:14:40,333 --> 02:14:44,200
more in generally speaking. It's finding the A players,

1643
02:14:44,266 --> 02:14:47,400
quote unquote, and removing the people that are slowing things down.

1644
02:14:48,066 --> 02:14:51,866
- Oh, yes, because the other thing that people don't realize is how

1645
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:55,366
demotivating working with a B player is.

1646
02:14:55,433 --> 02:14:59,966
Everybody can tell if the other person, the other engineer they're working with

1647
02:15:01,166 --> 02:15:05,100
is really competent. And it's very visible if

1648
02:15:05,133 --> 02:15:07,966
the person is not comfortable, they're asking the wrong questions,

1649
02:15:09,766 --> 02:15:14,100
they keep lagging behind. And at a certain point

1650
02:15:15,700 --> 02:15:23,400
if you're an A player, you get this dissatisfaction, this feeling that you are not

1651
02:15:23,533 --> 02:15:27,300
able to realize your full potential, accomplish what

1652
02:15:27,333 --> 02:15:31,966
you're really meant to accomplish because of this person

1653
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:37,033
working next to you or pretending to work next to you.

1654
02:15:37,033 --> 02:15:39,600
And, by the way, in some cases it's not because the person's

1655
02:15:39,633 --> 02:15:45,466
lazy. In some cases it's just, you know, their mental, their intellectual

1656
02:15:45,933 --> 02:15:51,733
ability is not there. It's not about experience. Most often it's about

1657
02:15:53,533 --> 02:16:01,000
natural ability and persistence. In 90% of cases, it's just the inability to

1658
02:16:01,133 --> 02:16:08,000
focus on one task for an extended period of time. Not everybody has this ability.

1659
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:15,233
So for people who do have this ability, it's an insult to work alongside someone

1660
02:16:16,666 --> 02:16:25,933
who is distracted and cannot go deep in the projects that they're responsible for.

1661
02:16:26,066 --> 02:16:29,500
- What's on this small tangent, what's your hiring

1662
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:33,500
process? You've shown, you've talked about

1663
02:16:33,532 --> 02:16:36,933
how you use competitions often, coding competitions, to hire, to find great

1664
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,500
engineers. What- what's your thinking behind that?

1665
02:16:40,532 --> 02:16:44,266
- Well, it's in line with my overall philosophy. I

1666
02:16:44,299 --> 02:16:47,799
think competition leads to progress. If you want to create

1667
02:16:47,833 --> 02:16:55,366
an ideal process to- for selecting the most qualified people for certain specific

1668
02:16:55,366 --> 02:16:58,100
tasks you have in mind. What can be better than a

1669
02:16:58,133 --> 02:17:01,866
competition? A coding contest where

1670
02:17:01,933 --> 02:17:05,866
everybody who wants to join your company as an engineer, or just wants to get

1671
02:17:05,900 --> 02:17:11,165
some prize money or validation, can demonstrate their skills,

1672
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:15,500
and then we just select the best. Or if we are not

1673
02:17:15,566 --> 02:17:18,900
certain because there's not enough data

1674
02:17:20,333 --> 02:17:25,200
to hire somebody, we just repeat the contest with another task,

1675
02:17:26,433 --> 02:17:29,600
get more data, get more winners. Then

1676
02:17:30,133 --> 02:17:34,600
repeat again. At some point, you realize, "Oh, actually, this guy

1677
02:17:35,799 --> 02:17:42,000
has competed in 10 of our contests since he was 16 years old, or 14 year old.

1678
02:17:43,766 --> 02:17:47,299
Now he's 20 or 21. He won in eight of these

1679
02:17:47,333 --> 02:17:54,400
competitions. He seems to be really good in JavaScript, in Android Java, and also

1680
02:17:54,400 --> 02:17:58,933
C++. Why not hire this person?

1681
02:17:59,966 --> 02:18:07,799
There's some consistency there. And a lot of these people, they have never worked in

1682
02:18:07,866 --> 02:18:12,900
a big company before, which is priceless. Because in a big company,

1683
02:18:14,733 --> 02:18:18,200
people tend to shift responsibility. They have this shared

1684
02:18:18,233 --> 02:18:23,466
responsibility wherein nobody fully understands

1685
02:18:25,266 --> 02:18:28,633
who can take credit for a project, who can take blame for a project.

1686
02:18:30,866 --> 02:18:36,766
Inside Telegram, it's pretty clear, and these competitions are

1687
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:45,633
the closest experience to what people will have when working at Telegram.

1688
02:18:46,299 --> 02:18:50,066
So for example, we want to implement some very tricky

1689
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:54,299
animation and redesign to our profile page of the Telegram

1690
02:18:55,600 --> 02:19:02,900
Android version. And the Android app, it's an open-source app. Anybody can take its

1691
02:19:02,966 --> 02:19:06,466
code and play with it. So as a result, we would

1692
02:19:06,566 --> 02:19:10,266
not just select the best person and hire this

1693
02:19:10,299 --> 02:19:14,133
person, we would also select the best solution to the problem, because we would

1694
02:19:14,266 --> 02:19:17,833
not suggest the contestants to solve trivial

1695
02:19:17,966 --> 02:19:21,799
problems. It's something that's valuable, it saves a lot of time

1696
02:19:21,866 --> 02:19:25,633
for us in terms of development. And because I always

1697
02:19:25,866 --> 02:19:29,700
had these large social media platforms which

1698
02:19:29,866 --> 02:19:33,266
I could use to promote these competitions...

1699
02:19:33,966 --> 02:19:40,266
...somehow both VK and Telegram were very popular among engineers

1700
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:43,900
and designers, other tech people.

1701
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:48,900
I had no issue to promote this contest and find the

1702
02:19:48,933 --> 02:19:54,000
right people, ever. And what can be better than

1703
02:19:55,266 --> 02:19:58,866
for an employee of your company, somebody who has been a user of

1704
02:19:58,933 --> 02:20:02,266
it? If this person has no prior experience

1705
02:20:03,166 --> 02:20:06,066
of using Telegram, their understanding would be very

1706
02:20:06,166 --> 02:20:10,900
limited. Why would I even try to hire somebody from LinkedIn who

1707
02:20:12,466 --> 02:20:20,233
worked at Google and other companies, is used to receiving a salary for nothing,

1708
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:26,600
is used to shifting responsibility and being stuck in endless meetings,

1709
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:35,200
and has very limited understanding of what Telegram stands for?

1710
02:20:36,733 --> 02:20:39,066
It's just crazy if you think about it.

1711
02:20:39,366 --> 02:20:43,333
- Yeah, and then because of that, you're extremely selective and slow

1712
02:20:43,366 --> 02:20:47,266
in hiring. So the people really have to

1713
02:20:47,300 --> 02:20:51,233
earn their spot. And as a result, I got a chance to sit in

1714
02:20:51,466 --> 02:20:55,100
one of the team meetings where people discuss the different

1715
02:20:55,166 --> 02:20:58,866
features that are being developed, the different ideas, some of which are at the very

1716
02:20:58,966 --> 02:21:02,800
cutting edge. So you get to see behind the scenes how it's possible to

1717
02:21:02,833 --> 02:21:04,200
have such a fast rate of

1718
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:08,966
idea generation. So you generate the idea, you implement the prototype and

1719
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,900
then eventually it becomes an actual

1720
02:21:12,966 --> 02:21:17,700
feature in the product. And so that's why you have this kind of half-hilarious,

1721
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:24,600
half-incredible fact that for many as compared to WhatsApp and

1722
02:21:24,700 --> 02:21:28,600
Signal, you've led the way in many other features. Many of the features we take

1723
02:21:28,633 --> 02:21:35,866
for granted now, many of which we know and love, like the auto-delete timer.

1724
02:21:35,933 --> 02:21:41,566
That was seven years ahead of any other messenger. Message editing,

1725
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,866
replies, these are all obvious things you...

1726
02:21:47,166 --> 02:21:50,766
I've even forgotten for some of them that they were never part.

1727
02:21:51,100 --> 02:21:54,433
I mean, I think the auto-delete timer is a really brilliant idea.

1728
02:21:54,466 --> 02:21:57,666
- We implemented it in 2013 in the secret

1729
02:21:57,700 --> 02:22:01,666
chats. The funny thing about it is then when other apps started to copy

1730
02:22:01,766 --> 02:22:09,266
it, like WhatsApp seven years after, and then Signal and some other apps,

1731
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:12,266
they initially even copied the exact

1732
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:17,066
timestamps. So for example, if we had like one, three, and five seconds, they would

1733
02:22:17,100 --> 02:22:18,800
also have one, three, and five seconds.

1734
02:22:19,433 --> 02:22:21,833
They tried not to change it because they were not sure

1735
02:22:22,833 --> 02:22:24,833
what was the magic sauce behind the feature.

1736
02:22:25,466 --> 02:22:29,466
And ironically, it happens with many of these things.

1737
02:22:29,500 --> 02:22:36,166
For example, when we design how you reply to a message, and you have a small snippet

1738
02:22:36,633 --> 02:22:40,200
showing that you're replying to this message and now you're typing your

1739
02:22:40,266 --> 02:22:43,966
response, then there is a small snippet in the message itself

1740
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,900
that, well, if you tap on it, highlights the original message

1741
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:51,966
you're replying to. Seems pretty obvious. But there are

1742
02:22:52,033 --> 02:22:55,866
certain design decisions that we were implementing at the time, and

1743
02:22:55,933 --> 02:22:59,533
we got this vertical line on the left, and all these other

1744
02:23:00,033 --> 02:23:03,366
small things that are completely arbitrary, right? You can do it in a different

1745
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:07,033
way. But somehow, the entire industry ended up

1746
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:10,600
copying exactly that solution, so now wherever you go,

1747
02:23:11,166 --> 02:23:15,033
WhatsApp, Instagram Direct, Facebook Messenger, Signal, it

1748
02:23:15,100 --> 02:23:18,900
doesn't matter, you would see exactly the same or pretty much

1749
02:23:19,633 --> 02:23:24,133
similar experience because nobody really wants to take the risk

1750
02:23:25,266 --> 02:23:31,700
and innovate. If something works, why not just copy it?

1751
02:23:31,766 --> 02:23:35,133
- Yeah, but we should say that it's done extremely well. The vertical line and the

1752
02:23:35,233 --> 02:23:39,133
highlighting, I mean, all of these are tiny little strokes of genius

1753
02:23:40,133 --> 02:23:43,300
by highlighting the text in a certain way that, from a design

1754
02:23:43,333 --> 02:23:46,766
perspective, makes it very clear that

1755
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:50,233
this part was written before and the thing under it is your

1756
02:23:50,266 --> 02:23:54,233
reply. The distinction between the different formatting of the text. I mean, there's

1757
02:23:54,300 --> 02:24:01,733
a... listen, I know how much typography is an art form. There's a lot of interacting

1758
02:24:02,433 --> 02:24:08,333
graphic artistic elements inside Telegram that all have to play together extremely

1759
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:12,266
well. Like you pointed out to me, there's this thing that just blew my

1760
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:18,100
mind, which is the background gradient of Telegram shifts. It changes

1761
02:24:19,266 --> 02:24:24,233
and it adjusts really nicely to the bubbles, the chat bubbles, and then there's like

1762
02:24:25,100 --> 02:24:28,766
graphic elements on top of the gradient that all interplay together. So

1763
02:24:28,966 --> 02:24:32,233
all of that has to work really nicely without sacrificing

1764
02:24:32,333 --> 02:24:36,133
clarity. Everything is just intuitive. That's very

1765
02:24:36,233 --> 02:24:40,633
difficult to create. That is art. And on top of that, it's super fast.

1766
02:24:40,700 --> 02:24:44,566
- That's the hardest part. To make it look so that designers love

1767
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:48,400
it is one thing. The real challenge is make

1768
02:24:48,466 --> 02:24:52,300
it look the way the designers love it and make it

1769
02:24:52,366 --> 02:24:56,066
work on the weakest device as possible, the oldest,

1770
02:24:56,133 --> 02:24:59,633
cheapest smartphones you can imagine. So if

1771
02:25:00,466 --> 02:25:04,300
you take the moving gradient on the background of

1772
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:08,200
every Telegram chat, this is something most people

1773
02:25:08,333 --> 02:25:12,033
don't notice, but they can feel it.

1774
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:16,033
- Yeah, yeah. They notice it subconsciously or something like that. There is a pleasant

1775
02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:19,533
feeling. There's a feeling, there's a pleasant

1776
02:25:19,566 --> 02:25:22,733
feeling when you're reading a chat and that's

1777
02:25:22,800 --> 02:25:26,500
where the design contributes to that. I think a

1778
02:25:26,533 --> 02:25:30,233
gradient really does. I really love that about Telegram, the

1779
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:34,200
gradient. Not the technical thing you described, but the feeling of it.

1780
02:25:34,400 --> 02:25:37,000
And then the technical aspect of creating that feeling is

1781
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,566
incredible. I could probably come up with all kinds of algorithms of

1782
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:44,500
rendering that gradient that's going to be super inefficient.

1783
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:46,800
And so doing that efficiently is like...

1784
02:25:46,833 --> 02:25:50,100
- Or efficient, but not too beautiful, because-

1785
02:25:50,133 --> 02:25:50,600
- Right.

1786
02:25:50,600 --> 02:25:55,800
- ...even doing something so trivial as a gradient can result

1787
02:25:56,033 --> 02:25:59,900
in noticeable lines in the gradient. The

1788
02:25:59,933 --> 02:26:03,566
person can instantly say, "Oh, no, it's not the right thing." So you have to

1789
02:26:03,633 --> 02:26:05,133
introduce certain randomness there

1790
02:26:06,100 --> 02:26:09,666
and then you have the gradient, but it's not enough. It's too plain. You want

1791
02:26:09,733 --> 02:26:13,633
to have certain pattern as an overlay, but it

1792
02:26:13,666 --> 02:26:17,600
should be simple enough not to distract you from the content,

1793
02:26:17,666 --> 02:26:21,633
but it has to be entertaining enough to create a good feeling about

1794
02:26:21,700 --> 02:26:26,200
the whole app. And another question, what kind of objects

1795
02:26:27,033 --> 02:26:31,500
you want to include in this pattern? And how would this pattern work? Will it be

1796
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:38,500
based on pixels or would it be vector-based? And would it be vector-based

1797
02:26:39,300 --> 02:26:41,800
so they will be infinitely scalable and high quality?

1798
02:26:43,033 --> 02:26:46,633
And then, I think for the default pattern and the default

1799
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:50,400
background, which is based on four colors. It's not a gradient based on two

1800
02:26:50,433 --> 02:26:56,633
colors; it's four colors, and they're constantly shifting. I probably looked through

1801
02:26:57,500 --> 02:27:00,133
several thousand variations of them

1802
02:27:01,133 --> 02:27:04,866
because this is such an important decision to make. It's the default back. Of course, you can change

1803
02:27:04,933 --> 02:27:09,400
it. Actually, you can set up your own four colors for that. You can change it.

1804
02:27:09,466 --> 02:27:10,433
- No way. Really?

1805
02:27:10,466 --> 02:27:14,300
- Yes. You can do it. And you want to rely on certain

1806
02:27:14,300 --> 02:27:18,133
deeply hard-coded biological properties of the

1807
02:27:18,133 --> 02:27:21,000
human mind, right? So which color do you want to

1808
02:27:21,066 --> 02:27:25,033
use? Is it gonna be blue? Is it gonna be yellow? Is

1809
02:27:25,033 --> 02:27:28,833
it going to be green? Because each color has a

1810
02:27:28,866 --> 02:27:32,833
different meaning in our brain. And what kind of objects

1811
02:27:32,900 --> 02:27:35,533
you want to put there. Something from

1812
02:27:36,666 --> 02:27:40,500
our childhood, something from nature, or something that

1813
02:27:40,533 --> 02:27:43,900
can create a different kind of mood. And this is just one detail of the

1814
02:27:43,966 --> 02:27:47,700
app. So there are many details. When you send a

1815
02:27:47,766 --> 02:27:51,600
message, you are done typing a message, and you then tap send

1816
02:27:51,933 --> 02:27:56,866
and then the message gradually appears in the chat. How does it happen? So you want

1817
02:27:57,733 --> 02:28:03,133
the input field to slowly morph into the actual message.

1818
02:28:03,133 --> 02:28:04,500
- To the message, yeah.

1819
02:28:04,533 --> 02:28:08,266
- And, and you want this to be done regardless of the

1820
02:28:08,333 --> 02:28:12,000
contents of the message, because sometimes the width would be different, sometimes it

1821
02:28:12,033 --> 02:28:17,366
would be containing media or a link preview or other stuff that will change

1822
02:28:18,200 --> 02:28:25,433
the message bubble. So you go through countless different

1823
02:28:25,500 --> 02:28:29,400
scenarios and make sure every one of them works

1824
02:28:29,433 --> 02:28:36,900
great, even if this message contains 4,000 characters. And then you

1825
02:28:36,933 --> 02:28:40,933
look at all the platforms: iOS, Android, and all the old devices

1826
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:45,800
of all kinds of outdated operating systems

1827
02:28:47,233 --> 02:28:52,333
and the hardware and you cross the two because you can have this really

1828
02:28:53,233 --> 02:28:57,233
bad old phone but using the newest operating

1829
02:28:57,333 --> 02:29:03,200
system version, so what do you do? What kind of bugs do you get there?

1830
02:29:04,133 --> 02:29:08,000
And then, of course, since Telegram works on tablets as

1831
02:29:08,066 --> 02:29:11,900
well, and our iOS version works on an iPad,

1832
02:29:11,966 --> 02:29:15,766
which I love a lot. You have to understand that

1833
02:29:15,866 --> 02:29:21,200
everything can be really big, so it can consume a lot of space on your screen.

1834
02:29:22,466 --> 02:29:29,066
and then it will trigger using more computational resources to render it. So,

1835
02:29:29,133 --> 02:29:34,066
there are a lot of nuances to it, but as long as you obsess over every small detail,

1836
02:29:34,966 --> 02:29:38,700
at least every detail that really counts, you can get to a

1837
02:29:38,766 --> 02:29:42,500
user experience. If you're really used to Telegram, if you've been a

1838
02:29:42,533 --> 02:29:48,333
regular user for at least a few weeks, going back to any other messaging app feels

1839
02:29:48,366 --> 02:29:53,500
like a serious downgrade.

1840
02:29:53,566 --> 02:29:57,633
- Yeah, I mean, there are so many really magical moments. Like, for example,

1841
02:29:58,566 --> 02:30:04,466
the way a message evaporates when you delete it. That is a really pleasant

1842
02:30:04,566 --> 02:30:05,466
experience.

1843
02:30:05,633 --> 02:30:07,666
- Oh, yeah. And boy,

1844
02:30:08,733 --> 02:30:14,166
was it hard to make, particularly on Android? This is this Thanos

1845
02:30:14,566 --> 02:30:18,100
snap effect, right? So, the message is broken into

1846
02:30:18,533 --> 02:30:22,266
tens of thousands of particles which go away like dust

1847
02:30:22,433 --> 02:30:28,066
in the wind. It looks great, but it was so hard to make.

1848
02:30:28,066 --> 02:30:37,666
- probably one of my favorite GUI graphical things. It's just art. It's

1849
02:30:37,733 --> 02:30:41,533
it's pure art. It's incredible. So, it's good to hear that it's been

1850
02:30:41,566 --> 02:30:45,866
really thought over and thought through, because it's extremely well done.

1851
02:30:45,900 --> 02:30:49,166
- No, you can't pull it off if you're not

1852
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:55,000
going deep into this. And then you don't want to distract people from

1853
02:30:56,433 --> 02:30:59,666
their communication with all this

1854
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:06,100
additional information, so you want them to be invisible in a way.

1855
02:31:06,566 --> 02:31:08,966
- They create the feeling, but they don't create distraction.

1856
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:13,833
- Yes, and in order to do that, you have to overcome even more

1857
02:31:14,833 --> 02:31:18,566
challenges. For example, you mentioned this deletion

1858
02:31:18,633 --> 02:31:22,600
effect: message evaporates. If you do the animation,

1859
02:31:22,666 --> 02:31:26,266
if you show the animation first, and then the message that

1860
02:31:26,333 --> 02:31:30,233
is preceding the deleted message that is going after the just deleted

1861
02:31:30,266 --> 02:31:36,066
message moves closer to each other, then it doesn't feel right. It feels

1862
02:31:36,866 --> 02:31:44,566
too long, too imposing. So, what you want to do is you want the message to disappear

1863
02:31:45,266 --> 02:31:52,633
while the messages around it go closer to each other to fill the resulting gap.

1864
02:31:53,333 --> 02:31:55,133
And then you imagine what that involves,

1865
02:31:56,233 --> 02:32:04,066
redrawing the entire screen. So, on top of this very complicated animation,

1866
02:32:04,133 --> 02:32:07,666
you have to think about things like which kind of messages were

1867
02:32:09,033 --> 02:32:13,833
there before it, after. That just adds to complexity.

1868
02:32:13,866 --> 02:32:17,700
- And once again, on all kinds of devices, all kinds of operating systems, all kinds

1869
02:32:17,766 --> 02:32:21,133
of tablets, phones, desktop, all of that.

1870
02:32:21,166 --> 02:32:25,066
- But, you know, once you accomplish it, it gives you this immense

1871
02:32:26,300 --> 02:32:29,933
sense of pride because nobody's doing this.

1872
02:32:30,033 --> 02:32:36,600
Nobody really cares. In a way, maybe they're right not to care. Maybe nobody notices

1873
02:32:36,666 --> 02:32:40,533
this. But there is something about it that feels

1874
02:32:40,533 --> 02:32:43,300
wrong when such things are neglected because I understand that every

1875
02:32:43,466 --> 02:32:47,900
day, tens of millions of people around the world are deleting messages.

1876
02:32:50,900 --> 02:32:52,333
What kind of experience do they get?

1877
02:32:53,566 --> 02:32:58,066
Is this an experience that maybe even subconsciously inspires them

1878
02:32:59,833 --> 02:33:04,900
and makes their heart sing even a little bit,

1879
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:15,533
fills them with joy, lightens up their mood even a little bit by 0.001%?

1880
02:33:15,533 --> 02:33:20,300
Or is it something that is just basic? And I think if we can

1881
02:33:22,666 --> 02:33:26,433
bring some value into people's lives, even through

1882
02:33:26,466 --> 02:33:32,233
these subtle details, we have to definitely invest our time in it.

1883
02:33:32,266 --> 02:33:36,200
- And some joy, not just sort of value, value like productivity, but

1884
02:33:36,333 --> 02:33:40,300
joy. I think Steve Jobs, Jony Ive talked about this. They would

1885
02:33:40,333 --> 02:33:44,066
put so much love and effort into the design of everything,

1886
02:33:44,133 --> 02:33:48,066
including things that weren't visible in the initial PCs, personal computers,

1887
02:33:48,133 --> 02:33:51,100
because they believe that somehow through

1888
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:55,000
osmosis, the users will be able to feel the love that the

1889
02:33:55,033 --> 02:33:58,500
designers put into the thing, and you're absolutely right. I mean,

1890
02:33:58,566 --> 02:34:02,966
it's not about deleting messages. I feel a little

1891
02:34:03,833 --> 02:34:10,733
inkling of joy when I see that evaporation animation. It's just nice.

1892
02:34:12,166 --> 02:34:16,033
I'm happier because of it, and so I feel that effort, and I

1893
02:34:16,066 --> 02:34:20,166
think, you know, a billion users feel that.

1894
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,233
- People like when other people care.

1895
02:34:23,300 --> 02:34:26,566
- Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what it

1896
02:34:26,666 --> 02:34:30,533
is. And of course, there are the more sexy things like all the

1897
02:34:30,566 --> 02:34:38,933
emojis and the stickers, the GIFs. Many of those are just little art pieces.

1898
02:34:39,966 --> 02:34:43,566
- That's, again, an intersection of art and technology because you look at the

1899
02:34:43,633 --> 02:34:48,400
stickers, which Telegram launched way before most of these other apps.

1900
02:34:48,433 --> 02:34:50,266
- Three years and eight months ahead.

1901
02:34:50,433 --> 02:34:52,333
- Ahead of WhatsApp, yes.

1902
02:34:52,366 --> 02:34:55,666
But the stickers that WhatsApp ended up launching three years and

1903
02:34:56,333 --> 02:35:00,166
eight months after, the first version was not really

1904
02:35:00,200 --> 02:35:08,466
good because they just did regular GIFs or WebM videos, which were

1905
02:35:08,466 --> 02:35:11,533
not based on vector graphics.

1906
02:35:12,533 --> 02:35:17,533
What we did is vector animations. Each of these stickers is only

1907
02:35:18,433 --> 02:35:22,266
several kilobytes, sometimes maybe a maximum of 20, 30 kilobytes

1908
02:35:22,433 --> 02:35:29,400
in size. But it's 180 frames. We were able to run them at 60 frames per

1909
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:33,466
second on all devices. And it's also very

1910
02:35:33,566 --> 02:35:37,433
challenging. It was a challenging thing to do. We had so much headache

1911
02:35:37,733 --> 02:35:41,400
trying to make it work. Nobody even tried to do anything like this

1912
02:35:41,433 --> 02:35:47,466
before us because it's crazily difficult. But as a result, you have these fluid

1913
02:35:47,533 --> 02:35:51,466
animations, you have this really nice user experience. Somebody sends

1914
02:35:51,500 --> 02:35:55,166
you a sticker, you don't have to wait for it to load because it's so lightweight

1915
02:35:55,933 --> 02:35:59,866
and it starts moving instantly. And then of course, it's not just

1916
02:35:59,933 --> 02:36:07,233
engineering. You have to find designers that are able to create the stickers

1917
02:36:07,266 --> 02:36:10,366
using vector graphics, which means they're based on

1918
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:14,466
curves described by formulas, not just created

1919
02:36:14,533 --> 02:36:17,766
as photographs with pixels. Where do you find these

1920
02:36:17,766 --> 02:36:25,133
people? Again, we did competitions but it was not easy to assemble a team

1921
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:28,800
of artists, slash engineers, I would say, that are able to do something like

1922
02:36:28,866 --> 02:36:32,800
engineers I would say that are able to do something like

1923
02:36:32,833 --> 02:36:39,366
this. This is a unique form of art. And this allowed us to

1924
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:43,033
do a revolution in stickers, then another revolution

1925
02:36:43,266 --> 02:36:47,133
in animated emoji that you can add into messages,

1926
02:36:47,166 --> 02:36:51,166
custom animated emoji. I don't think anybody did that. I think Telegram is

1927
02:36:51,233 --> 02:36:54,533
still the only one allowing users to do that because you can

1928
02:36:54,566 --> 02:36:57,533
include a hundred of animated emoji in a message

1929
02:36:58,366 --> 02:37:03,366
and they will be animated and they will be moving and your device won't crash.

1930
02:37:04,200 --> 02:37:08,000
It's probably unnecessary and crazy but we think somewhere in this

1931
02:37:08,033 --> 02:37:11,366
intersection of art and engineering true

1932
02:37:11,700 --> 02:37:15,433
quality is created and then of course more recently

1933
02:37:16,333 --> 02:37:19,666
we expanded into what we call Telegram GeMs.

1934
02:37:20,266 --> 02:37:24,066
which are essentially blockchain based collectibles that

1935
02:37:24,133 --> 02:37:28,066
you can demonstrate on your Telegram profile so that they

1936
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:32,066
get social relevance but you can also use them to congratulate your

1937
02:37:32,566 --> 02:37:37,000
friends and close ones with their birthdays and other holidays

1938
02:37:38,166 --> 02:37:41,566
and that was received extremely well.

1939
02:37:41,633 --> 02:37:45,600
- Yeah, they can hold value, they can increase in value, you could trade them for that in that aspect, but

1940
02:37:45,733 --> 02:37:53,633
to me, still the... The vector graphics, and it's not just simple graphics, it's

1941
02:37:53,666 --> 02:37:57,533
incredibly intricate graphics so the vector makes it very

1942
02:37:57,566 --> 02:38:04,066
efficient but it also allows you to create, maybe it incentivizes the artist,

1943
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:10,433
enables them, incentivizes them to create super detailed intricate

1944
02:38:11,333 --> 02:38:15,266
elements and then the final result like you would think it wouldn't matter but the final

1945
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:18,733
result has like a lot of stuff going on and it's, and it allows you to

1946
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:21,833
scale on arbitrary devices and not, now it's like this

1947
02:38:21,866 --> 02:38:28,800
little... you know like usually GIFs from like back in the day and still in

1948
02:38:28,833 --> 02:38:35,266
meme form are low resolution and so usually people don't put details and

1949
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:39,000
intricate art into it but here with vector graphics it's

1950
02:38:39,066 --> 02:38:42,733
like, like a million things going on and it allows you to play with different

1951
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:46,300
animations like you showed me this thing where you send and you

1952
02:38:46,533 --> 02:38:50,233
hold for a while on the send button and so

1953
02:38:50,366 --> 02:38:54,300
you can share with the person you sent a message to this

1954
02:38:54,366 --> 02:38:57,766
animation that you've encoded. Like there's a bunch of stuff going on when they read the

1955
02:38:57,833 --> 02:38:59,033
message.

1956
02:38:59,033 --> 02:39:02,566
- Yes, we have a lot of features like that when we use

1957
02:39:02,666 --> 02:39:06,200
this art to allow people to express themselves.

1958
02:39:07,866 --> 02:39:09,800
and most people don't even know about these features.

1959
02:39:09,866 --> 02:39:12,366
- I didn't know about it. That was cool. That was cool.

1960
02:39:12,400 --> 02:39:16,333
- The other application of the same technology is reactions on

1961
02:39:16,366 --> 02:39:25,266
Telegram because we made it a goal to make sure that

1962
02:39:25,266 --> 02:39:32,633
people feel joy when they just send you a like. Something so trivial

1963
02:39:32,700 --> 02:39:38,666
as just adding a like to a message should be an action that you

1964
02:39:39,633 --> 02:39:42,966
want to perform again and again and again.

1965
02:39:43,033 --> 02:39:46,800
- So another feature is on the more serious side is end-to-end encryption. So

1966
02:39:46,866 --> 02:39:50,566
you led the industry in that. It was

1967
02:39:50,666 --> 02:39:54,466
launched one year and three months ahead. Can you speak

1968
02:39:54,600 --> 02:39:58,233
to why you decided to add end-to-end encryption, how you

1969
02:39:58,300 --> 02:40:02,000
developed the current encryption algorithm in the beginning? What was your thinking behind

1970
02:40:02,066 --> 02:40:03,033
that?

1971
02:40:03,233 --> 02:40:08,133
- So in 2013 when we were launching Telegram,

1972
02:40:10,133 --> 02:40:15,833
we were aware of the serious issue with privacy

1973
02:40:17,033 --> 02:40:19,066
that Edward Snowden made very clear.

1974
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:25,000
And we thought, yes, we are designing this product in a way that is

1975
02:40:26,166 --> 02:40:29,400
already extremely secure, but we want to make

1976
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,133
sure that not even we can access user messages.

1977
02:40:34,066 --> 02:40:37,433
And we understood very clearly that a bunch of people who

1978
02:40:37,533 --> 02:40:41,466
were born in Russia don't necessarily inspire trust.

1979
02:40:42,566 --> 02:40:46,666
So that's why we made Telegram open source. So all our apps have been

1980
02:40:48,533 --> 02:40:51,066
open available on GitHub since 2013.

1981
02:40:52,733 --> 02:40:59,866
And then we added end-to-end encryption in our secret chats, which WhatsApp copied

1982
02:41:00,266 --> 02:41:04,233
a few years after. One year and three months ahead, they just started to test

1983
02:41:04,266 --> 02:41:08,633
it. They rolled it out I think 2016, which is

1984
02:41:10,466 --> 02:41:14,433
three years after us, and the only reason I think the rest of the industry

1985
02:41:14,466 --> 02:41:23,300
had to do it is because we set the standard.

1986
02:41:23,366 --> 02:41:26,966
It was incredibly important back in the day, and at the same time, we realized

1987
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:31,500
certain limitations of end-to-end encryption. So within that

1988
02:41:33,233 --> 02:41:37,933
design, that architecture, you can't support

1989
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:44,133
very large chat communities with consistent, persistent

1990
02:41:44,166 --> 02:41:50,700
chat histories. You can't support huge one-on-many channels. You'd have issues with

1991
02:41:51,866 --> 02:41:58,433
maintaining bots that have lots of incoming messages.

1992
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:03,366
Multiple device support becomes tricky. People

1993
02:42:03,433 --> 02:42:07,300
will end up losing some of the documents they share, so we

1994
02:42:07,366 --> 02:42:12,433
also saw a lot of issues, and we ended up having this sort of

1995
02:42:13,966 --> 02:42:20,200
hybrid experience, where depending on your use case

1996
02:42:20,233 --> 02:42:27,133
and your requirements, you can choose the level of encryption that we want to have.

1997
02:42:27,166 --> 02:42:31,133
- So that's why you chose to go opt-in for end-to-end encryption.

1998
02:42:31,166 --> 02:42:34,966
So the trade-off there that you're describing is between, for

1999
02:42:35,066 --> 02:42:39,000
people who really care about specific messages extreme privacy on

2000
02:42:39,066 --> 02:42:43,000
those messages, and usability, like being able to

2001
02:42:43,066 --> 02:42:46,700
sync across multiple devices, having groups that are 200,000

2002
02:42:46,766 --> 02:42:50,166
people. So all of those features,

2003
02:42:50,200 --> 02:42:54,133
that quality of life features, there's a trade-off between

2004
02:42:54,200 --> 02:42:58,066
those and end-to-end encryption. So you lean towards

2005
02:42:58,133 --> 02:43:02,033
letting users sort of enable end-to-end encryption for cases when

2006
02:43:02,066 --> 02:43:04,600
they want to be super secure.

2007
02:43:04,666 --> 02:43:08,466
- Yes, and Secret Chats are not just end-to-end encrypted, you know. There are certain

2008
02:43:08,500 --> 02:43:12,400
limitations that are both their feature and a bug. For example, you

2009
02:43:12,500 --> 02:43:18,366
can't screenshot them. You can't forward any document, any message from

2010
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:23,366
them, which is not necessarily something you need when you're

2011
02:43:24,566 --> 02:43:28,066
trying to get some work done and you're just

2012
02:43:28,133 --> 02:43:34,866
communicating with your team on a project. So it became very clear to us that there

2013
02:43:34,966 --> 02:43:42,233
are different needs here, and if you try to combine both in one type of chat,

2014
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:49,700
you will end up losing a lot of utility. You know, we at Telegram, we don't use any

2015
02:43:51,666 --> 02:43:55,300
collaboration tool for teamwork. We use Telegram to

2016
02:43:55,566 --> 02:43:59,433
build Telegram. So we felt instantly when we were trying to switch to, say,

2017
02:43:59,433 --> 02:44:09,100
Secret Chats to share large documents and try to get work done, it was just not

2018
02:44:10,333 --> 02:44:14,066
adapted for it. At the same time, if you

2019
02:44:14,100 --> 02:44:17,400
were really paranoid, you think, you know, "I don't wanna be

2020
02:44:17,533 --> 02:44:21,866
screenshotted, I don't wanna have any leaks,

2021
02:44:23,066 --> 02:44:30,866
I don't even trust Telegram; I only trust code," Secret Chats are the best option. I

2022
02:44:31,066 --> 02:44:35,433
believe it is the most secure means of communication today.

2023
02:44:36,066 --> 02:44:39,933
- And we should say that there's a lot of other aspects to this that are important.

2024
02:44:40,166 --> 02:44:44,066
For example, Telegram is the only app that has open source

2025
02:44:44,366 --> 02:44:49,166
reproducible builds for both Android and iOS. Why is this important?

2026
02:44:49,200 --> 02:44:55,133
- So, you need reproducible builds in order to verify that the app

2027
02:44:55,233 --> 02:44:59,166
really does what it claims, really encrypts data

2028
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:08,166
in a way that it is described on its website. For that, you need to make your apps

2029
02:45:09,333 --> 02:45:14,866
open source for any researchers to have a look at it.

2030
02:45:14,966 --> 02:45:21,566
So, Telegram has been open source since 2013. Apps like

2031
02:45:21,633 --> 02:45:25,566
WhatsApp have never been open source, so you don't really know what they're doing and

2032
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:31,600
how exactly they encrypt your messages. What's important here,

2033
02:45:31,633 --> 02:45:38,000
though, is to understand whether the version of the app that you download from the

2034
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:41,533
app store corresponds exactly

2035
02:45:42,433 --> 02:45:48,200
to the source code that you can view on GitHub. And for that, you need reproducible

2036
02:45:48,266 --> 02:45:54,966
builds. As you said, Telegram is the only popular messaging app that does that.

2037
02:45:55,033 --> 02:45:58,033
We allow people to make sure both on Android and

2038
02:45:58,066 --> 02:46:01,766
iOS that the source code of Telegram on

2039
02:46:01,800 --> 02:46:05,766
GitHub and the app you're actually using is the same app.

2040
02:46:05,833 --> 02:46:09,766
I think it's incredibly important, not just to gain people's trust, but just

2041
02:46:09,800 --> 02:46:13,500
to stay transparent and open about it. When I make this claim

2042
02:46:13,566 --> 02:46:17,400
that Telegram's Secret Chats are the most secure

2043
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:22,900
way of communicating, I really mean it, because I

2044
02:46:22,966 --> 02:46:26,933
haven't seen any fact contradicting this

2045
02:46:26,933 --> 02:46:32,600
claim. At least among the popular messaging apps, you say WhatsApp,

2046
02:46:33,766 --> 02:46:40,800
Signal, iMessage, none of them have reproducible builds on both iOS and Android.

2047
02:46:42,033 --> 02:46:47,000
None of them have, at least at the same level, put so much effort

2048
02:46:48,200 --> 02:46:53,833
into making sure that the algorithms that you

2049
02:46:53,933 --> 02:47:01,466
use in order to encrypt data are not algorithms that have been handed to you

2050
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:10,766
by some agency in order to create a honeypot.

2051
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:18,066
At least from what I know about our competitors,

2052
02:47:18,166 --> 02:47:22,633
I don't think they went through the same process.

2053
02:47:22,633 --> 02:47:26,600
- So, we should say that the entirety of the software stack in Telegram is done from

2054
02:47:26,700 --> 02:47:30,066
scratch internally to Telegram, so we're talking about not just the encryption

2055
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:32,533
but everything running on the servers.

2056
02:47:33,966 --> 02:47:36,800
So the servers are built out, the hardware and the software are all done

2057
02:47:36,866 --> 02:47:40,466
internally, which is one of the ways you reduce the attack surface

2058
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:45,333
on the entire stack that handles the messages.

2059
02:47:45,400 --> 02:47:51,966
- It does make it more secure, because if Snowden's revelations

2060
02:47:52,833 --> 02:47:59,233
taught us anything, is that very often open source tools, modules,

2061
02:47:59,266 --> 02:48:02,333
libraries that are used by everybody

2062
02:48:04,233 --> 02:48:06,966
ended up having certain flaws and security issues.

2063
02:48:09,266 --> 02:48:11,933
that make software vulnerable. It's also a way

2064
02:48:13,466 --> 02:48:18,533
to make sure you're doing things the most efficient way possible.

2065
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:25,100
But it's extremely difficult to do that. You really have to have

2066
02:48:25,166 --> 02:48:29,966
exceptional talent on your team to achieve this

2067
02:48:30,766 --> 02:48:34,566
level of thoroughness, to go to a low

2068
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:39,633
level of coding that allows you to recreate from scratch database engines,

2069
02:48:41,533 --> 02:48:45,433
web servers, entire programming languages.

2070
02:48:47,566 --> 02:48:51,133
Because the programming language we use on the backend

2071
02:48:53,333 --> 02:49:00,066
to develop the API for the client apps is also entirely built by our team.

2072
02:49:00,833 --> 02:49:04,433
- Yeah, so minimizing reliance on open source libraries is extremely difficult,

2073
02:49:04,466 --> 02:49:09,666
as most companies, they rely on open source libraries.

2074
02:49:09,733 --> 02:49:13,100
- Well, I wouldn't say we're completely independent from that.

2075
02:49:13,166 --> 02:49:17,133
We use Linux on the backend. There's no way of avoiding it for us at the moment.

2076
02:49:17,166 --> 02:49:26,733
But for the most part, we are much more self-reliant than most other apps.

2077
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:30,666
- You mentioned Edward Snowden. A long time ago, you wanted to work together with him,

2078
02:49:31,600 --> 02:49:38,033
perhaps to share expertise to understand the full realm of this...

2079
02:49:38,833 --> 02:49:42,666
of what it takes to achieve cybersecurity. What do you make of his case? What

2080
02:49:42,733 --> 02:49:46,066
lessons do you learn from what he has uncovered, and

2081
02:49:47,333 --> 02:49:53,366
maybe even broadly, what impact has his work had on the world, do you think?

2082
02:49:53,433 --> 02:49:59,000
- Well, the main lesson is not everything is what it seems. As you would

2083
02:50:00,433 --> 02:50:02,000
discover, and this is

2084
02:50:02,966 --> 02:50:06,833
something that I found quite shocking at the time, that a lot of people

2085
02:50:08,266 --> 02:50:15,233
who you thought were security and cryptography experts

2086
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:20,533
ended up being agents of the NSA in one way or the other,

2087
02:50:22,033 --> 02:50:28,333
promoting flawed encryption standards. You would end up discovering that

2088
02:50:31,233 --> 02:50:37,300
your government that was supposed to be limited in how it can surveil its people

2089
02:50:38,933 --> 02:50:43,833
actually doesn't consider itself that limited. And that was very

2090
02:50:45,633 --> 02:50:48,266
valuable for the world to understand.

2091
02:50:50,633 --> 02:50:54,333
I guess it also can be a lesson demonstrating that we

2092
02:50:54,366 --> 02:51:00,800
humans don't get the balance right. So 9/11 created

2093
02:51:02,500 --> 02:51:07,933
a situation when the government had to respond, and it

2094
02:51:07,966 --> 02:51:11,866
responded, but it overreacted. It ended

2095
02:51:11,966 --> 02:51:15,766
up eroding certain basic rights and freedoms, including the right to

2096
02:51:15,833 --> 02:51:18,866
privacy, because the government always wants to

2097
02:51:18,933 --> 02:51:22,633
increase its powers, and the government always

2098
02:51:22,666 --> 02:51:26,400
tries to do it at the expense of citizens. You have

2099
02:51:27,233 --> 02:51:34,433
this situation when the cure is worse than the disease. And I think it was

2100
02:51:34,466 --> 02:51:40,033
incredibly brave to do what Edward did. I didn't get to work with him

2101
02:51:41,166 --> 02:51:48,166
or ever see him in person. We keep in touch, we sometimes communicate,

2102
02:51:50,366 --> 02:51:55,566
but we're not close. I still think what he did is laudable.

2103
02:51:57,266 --> 02:51:58,700
I hope someday we'll meet.

2104
02:51:58,933 --> 02:52:06,900
- You yourself have faced the full force of various governments, intelligence

2105
02:52:06,966 --> 02:52:08,233
agencies.

2106
02:52:10,366 --> 02:52:15,633
Is there any intelligence agency you're afraid of? Any government you're afraid of?

2107
02:52:15,700 --> 02:52:19,466
- I think they should all be equally afraid of, or equally not afraid

2108
02:52:19,533 --> 02:52:23,200
of in a way. It's not that this

2109
02:52:23,233 --> 02:52:26,533
intelligence service can kill you and the other can't kill you.

2110
02:52:26,566 --> 02:52:27,566
- They all can kill you?

2111
02:52:27,633 --> 02:52:31,600
- I guess they all can kill me one way or the other, but

2112
02:52:31,633 --> 02:52:33,933
it's a matter of whether I'm afraid of death.

2113
02:52:33,966 --> 02:52:37,900
- This goes back to the beginning of our conversation, I think, multiple times.

2114
02:52:37,900 --> 02:52:42,566
So you're in general fearless in the face of the pressure.

2115
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:45,933
- That would be a very bold statement, but I proved to be quite stress

2116
02:52:45,933 --> 02:52:49,433
resilient. And it's not that you don't have

2117
02:52:49,466 --> 02:52:53,733
fear. You can have fear, but you overcome this fear.

2118
02:52:55,566 --> 02:53:03,433
I don't think there is anything

2119
02:53:04,633 --> 02:53:09,766
at this point that can happen to change the way I am.

2120
02:53:11,133 --> 02:53:14,600
- So you went through a lot from 2011 to 2014,

2121
02:53:15,066 --> 02:53:19,000
government pressure that you refused to give in to that led

2122
02:53:19,066 --> 02:53:26,466
you to create Telegram and let go of VK. And then in 2018,

2123
02:53:28,166 --> 02:53:30,933
Russia and Iran decided to ban

2124
02:53:31,033 --> 02:53:34,966
Telegram. That was another example of pressure. Can you take

2125
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
me through that saga in 2018?

2126
02:53:38,033 --> 02:53:43,166
- So in 2018, Telegram started to become popular. I think we had something like

2127
02:53:46,033 --> 02:53:54,700
200 million users, and it increasingly became popular in places like Iran and Russia,

2128
02:53:56,266 --> 02:54:01,400
and other countries where sometimes people

2129
02:54:03,400 --> 02:54:11,833
have something to hide from the government. In Iran, people used Telegram to protest

2130
02:54:11,900 --> 02:54:15,600
against the government. They had these huge channels

2131
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:21,300
that would use to organize the protests,

2132
02:54:23,400 --> 02:54:29,233
and eventually the government couldn't keep up. They decided to ban Telegram.

2133
02:54:30,866 --> 02:54:33,900
People would still keep using it, though, using

2134
02:54:33,933 --> 02:54:44,800
VPNs. It didn't help. The government invested a lot in coming up with their own

2135
02:54:44,833 --> 02:54:47,933
messaging app. They had several teams

2136
02:54:47,966 --> 02:54:51,933
competing for the title of the national Iranian

2137
02:54:52,033 --> 02:54:55,966
messaging app. All these apps failed. People

2138
02:54:56,033 --> 02:54:59,866
still preferred Telegram. Interestingly, Iran banned Telegram, but

2139
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:06,133
WhatsApp wasn't banned, or at least they unbanned WhatsApp soon

2140
02:55:06,200 --> 02:55:14,300
after. At the same time, starting in mid-2017 or late-2017, Russia

2141
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:18,933
demanded that Telegram hand them the

2142
02:55:18,966 --> 02:55:22,900
encryption keys. They thought these things exist, something

2143
02:55:23,033 --> 02:55:26,800
that would allow them to read messages of every

2144
02:55:26,833 --> 02:55:30,300
person on Telegram, or at least every person on Telegram in Russia.

2145
02:55:30,400 --> 02:55:37,600
And we told them, "That's impossible. If you have to ban us, ban us."

2146
02:55:37,800 --> 02:55:44,633
And this is what they ended up doing in spring 2018.

2147
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:49,666
And that was quite fun because they were

2148
02:55:49,766 --> 02:55:54,300
trying to block our IP addresses, but we were prepared for that,

2149
02:55:56,300 --> 02:55:59,133
and we came up with this technology that allowed us to

2150
02:56:00,066 --> 02:56:08,266
rotate IP addresses, replacing them with new ones every time the censor blocks our

2151
02:56:09,033 --> 02:56:14,400
existing addresses. And then it was completely automated. We had

2152
02:56:15,633 --> 02:56:22,166
millions of IP addresses. We would be burning through them. We set up this movement

2153
02:56:22,233 --> 02:56:27,066
called digital resistance when system administrators and engineers

2154
02:56:28,033 --> 02:56:31,766
all around the world, both inside and outside Russia, could set up their own

2155
02:56:31,800 --> 02:56:37,500
proxy servers and their own IP addresses for Telegram to rely

2156
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:41,500
on in order to bypass censorship. We

2157
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:45,233
ended up spending, I think, millions of dollars on that.

2158
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:54,233
And as a result, the censor got crazy there. They would ban IP addresses and larger

2159
02:56:54,366 --> 02:57:01,200
subnets of IP addresses then. Huge subnets which resulted in a weird

2160
02:57:01,233 --> 02:57:05,166
situation where parts of the country's infrastructure started to

2161
02:57:05,200 --> 02:57:10,533
Like people were trying to pay for groceries in the supermarkets, and

2162
02:57:12,566 --> 02:57:13,433
nothing would work

2163
02:57:14,433 --> 02:57:18,333
because the Russian censor blocked too many IP addresses. And some of the

2164
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:26,333
subnets were used to host other unrelated services. Even some Russian

2165
02:57:26,333 --> 02:57:30,633
social networks and media got affected, banks.

2166
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:36,500
So they had to start being more selective in how they combat

2167
02:57:38,166 --> 02:57:44,566
our anti-censorship tools. The biggest resistance we got at the time was from

2168
02:57:44,666 --> 02:57:53,833
Apple. Apple didn't allow us to update Telegram in their App Store, saying

2169
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:57,866
for at least four weeks that we

2170
02:57:57,933 --> 02:58:01,800
have to come to an agreement with Russia first. We said,

2171
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:08,166
"It's not possible." They said, "We will allow you to push your update

2172
02:58:09,033 --> 02:58:15,266
for Telegram worldwide, except for Russia." We didn't want to do that.

2173
02:58:15,433 --> 02:58:19,800
Almost lost hope. You know, at some point I said, "You know, maybe

2174
02:58:20,966 --> 02:58:25,400
this is the only way. Maybe we should leave the Russian market. Stop

2175
02:58:26,400 --> 02:58:30,200
allowing users from Russia to download the app from the App Store, which would

2176
02:58:30,266 --> 02:58:40,200
mean it's over." We helped organize certain protests in defense of Telegram

2177
02:58:40,233 --> 02:58:42,900
and privacy and freedom of speech in 2018 in Moscow.

2178
02:58:42,933 --> 02:58:47,633
There were hilarious people flying paper airplanes.

2179
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:48,400
- I saw that.

2180
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:53,533
- And at some point, I decided, "I have to make a statement. I have to

2181
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:59,366
say that Apple sided with the censor." That we are trying to do the right thing

2182
02:58:59,433 --> 02:59:04,200
here, but without Apple we can't do much,

2183
02:59:06,833 --> 02:59:11,366
'cause people can't download your app anymore.

2184
02:59:13,133 --> 02:59:18,200
I published it in my channel and then the New York Times picked it up with the

2185
02:59:19,266 --> 02:59:26,000
picture of the protestors flying paper airplanes. Apple was criticized in that story,

2186
02:59:27,066 --> 02:59:31,466
and I thought, "Well, Apple should probably

2187
02:59:33,033 --> 02:59:37,000
come back to the right side of history here." And I waited for

2188
02:59:37,033 --> 02:59:40,400
one day and two days. In the

2189
02:59:40,433 --> 02:59:45,000
meantime, since we've been unable to update Telegram for more than a month,

2190
02:59:46,733 --> 02:59:56,300
it started to fall apart because the new version of iOS came out,

2191
02:59:57,833 --> 03:00:04,333
and it made the old versions of Telegram obsolete. Some features that used to

2192
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:08,033
work stopped working and users all over the world started to suffer.

2193
03:00:08,100 --> 03:00:15,666
Like, people that had nothing to do with Russia from other parts of the world,

2194
03:00:15,700 --> 03:00:18,833
experienced issues with Telegram.

2195
03:00:20,366 --> 03:00:23,633
So it was really serious, and I said to my team, "You know what? If

2196
03:00:24,800 --> 03:00:26,966
by 6:00 PM today," I think it was a Friday,

2197
03:00:29,866 --> 03:00:33,800
"nothing changes and Apple doesn't allow us to push

2198
03:00:33,866 --> 03:00:37,733
the version of Telegram through, let's just forget about the

2199
03:00:37,766 --> 03:00:41,300
Russian market. Let's keep going because the rest of the world is more

2200
03:00:41,333 --> 03:00:44,533
important." It's sad, but what can we do?

2201
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:48,400
- Which, by the way, removes all the people that want to protest, all the people that

2202
03:00:48,433 --> 03:00:51,400
want to talk in Russia, it removes their ability to have a voice

2203
03:00:52,233 --> 03:00:55,133
in the most popular messaging app in that part of the world.

2204
03:00:55,800 --> 03:00:59,633
- Yes. Magically, 15 minutes to the time

2205
03:00:59,733 --> 03:01:03,700
I was planning to remove Telegram from the Russian App Store in order to

2206
03:01:03,733 --> 03:01:07,333
proceed globally, Apple reached

2207
03:01:08,300 --> 03:01:14,533
out to us and said, "It's okay. Your update is approved."

2208
03:01:14,566 --> 03:01:20,033
And we managed to keep playing.

2209
03:01:21,300 --> 03:01:28,000
this hide and seek game with the censor, bypassing censorship through digital

2210
03:01:28,033 --> 03:01:33,233
resistance. In Iran, it was a little bit different because we realized

2211
03:01:34,333 --> 03:01:37,666
it would've been too expensive to try to

2212
03:01:38,933 --> 03:01:43,700
come up with all those IP addresses. And in addition, it was

2213
03:01:45,133 --> 03:01:49,000
not clear whether we wouldn't be in violation of the sanctions regime,

2214
03:01:50,600 --> 03:01:55,300
so we did something else. We created an economic incentive

2215
03:01:56,200 --> 03:02:01,700
for people who would set up proxy servers for Telegram.

2216
03:02:01,800 --> 03:02:09,666
Any person, say an Iranian engineer, could come up with a proxy server, distribute

2217
03:02:10,233 --> 03:02:17,833
its address among users in Iran, and whoever connected through the proxy of this

2218
03:02:18,733 --> 03:02:23,533
person would be able to see a pinned chat, an ad

2219
03:02:24,733 --> 03:02:27,933
placed there by the system administrator, the owner of the

2220
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:33,933
proxy. And this is how you can monetize your proxy, so it created this

2221
03:02:36,800 --> 03:02:43,533
market, which resulted in Iranians

2222
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:49,000
fixing their own problem and as a result, we kept

2223
03:02:50,033 --> 03:02:52,600
millions, or maybe tens of millions, of Iranian

2224
03:02:52,700 --> 03:02:57,966
users. Up until this day, I think Telegram is still banned in Iran

2225
03:02:59,100 --> 03:03:01,766
today, but we probably have

2226
03:03:03,066 --> 03:03:08,433
something like 50 million people relying on Telegram from that country.

2227
03:03:08,500 --> 03:03:09,933
- So the people find a way around?

2228
03:03:09,966 --> 03:03:11,833
- People find a way around.

2229
03:03:11,833 --> 03:03:15,533
- That's ingenious. That's really great to hear.

2230
03:03:17,433 --> 03:03:20,500
I have to ask you about this. After having spent many days with

2231
03:03:20,600 --> 03:03:23,933
you, I learned of something that you've never talked about

2232
03:03:25,733 --> 03:03:28,433
at the time, have not talked about to this day,

2233
03:03:29,766 --> 03:03:35,666
that there was an assassination attempt on you using what appears to be poisoning in

2234
03:03:35,733 --> 03:03:42,733
2018. I think to me, it showed the seriousness of this fight to uphold the

2235
03:03:42,800 --> 03:03:48,666
freedom of speech for everyone, for all people of Earth that you're

2236
03:03:48,733 --> 03:03:54,500
doing. I have to say, it would mean a lot to me if you tell me this story.

2237
03:03:55,366 --> 03:03:59,066
- Well, this is something I never talked about publicly because I didn't

2238
03:03:59,133 --> 03:04:07,033
want people to freak out, particularly at the time. It was spring 2018.

2239
03:04:09,133 --> 03:04:11,500
We were trying to raise funds for

2240
03:04:12,466 --> 03:04:20,766
TON, a blockchain project, working with all kinds of VCs and investors. In the

2241
03:04:20,833 --> 03:04:26,633
meantime, we had a couple of countries trying to ban Telegram, so

2242
03:04:26,700 --> 03:04:30,666
it wasn't exactly the best moment for me to start

2243
03:04:30,733 --> 03:04:36,533
sharing anything related to my personal health. But

2244
03:04:37,833 --> 03:04:41,300
that was something that is hard to forget.

2245
03:04:43,400 --> 03:04:49,933
I never felt ill. I believe I have perfect health. I very rarely have headaches

2246
03:04:51,666 --> 03:04:56,366
or bad cough. I don't take pills because I don't have to take pills,

2247
03:04:57,900 --> 03:05:03,866
and that was the only instant in my life when I think I was

2248
03:05:03,900 --> 03:05:07,333
dying. I came back home, opened

2249
03:05:07,800 --> 03:05:12,100
the door of my townhouse, the place I rented. I had this weird neighbor

2250
03:05:13,033 --> 03:05:19,000
and he left something for me there around the door.

2251
03:05:20,466 --> 03:05:27,066
And one hour after, when I was already in my bed, so I was living alone,

2252
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:42,133
I felt very bad. I felt pain all over my body. I tried to get up and

2253
03:05:44,266 --> 03:05:48,600
go to the bathroom. But while I was going there,

2254
03:05:49,800 --> 03:05:54,866
I felt that functions of my body started to switch off. First, the

2255
03:05:55,900 --> 03:06:02,700
eyesight and hearing, then I had difficulty breathing, everything

2256
03:06:02,733 --> 03:06:15,633
accompanied by very acute pain, heart, stomach, all blood vessels.

2257
03:06:17,300 --> 03:06:21,033
It was... It's a difficult thing to explain,

2258
03:06:21,100 --> 03:06:24,866
but one thing I was certain about is, yeah, this is it.

2259
03:06:24,900 --> 03:06:26,533
- You thought you were gonna die?

2260
03:06:26,566 --> 03:06:30,400
- Yeah. This is it, because I couldn't breathe, I couldn't see anything.

2261
03:06:30,466 --> 03:06:34,300
It was very painful. I think it's over.

2262
03:06:34,933 --> 03:06:38,800
I thought, well, I have had a good life. I managed to accomplish a

2263
03:06:38,900 --> 03:06:40,600
few... accomplish a few things.

2264
03:06:42,966 --> 03:06:45,200
And then I collapsed on the floor, but I don't remember it,

2265
03:06:47,700 --> 03:06:53,200
because the pain covered everything. I found myself

2266
03:06:55,066 --> 03:06:58,566
on the floor next day. It was already bright.

2267
03:07:00,200 --> 03:07:05,933
And I couldn't stand up. I was super weak. I looked at my

2268
03:07:07,400 --> 03:07:13,033
arms and my body, blood vessels were broken all over my

2269
03:07:13,066 --> 03:07:16,866
body. Something like this never happened to me. I

2270
03:07:16,866 --> 03:07:21,500
couldn't walk for two weeks after. I stayed at my place,

2271
03:07:23,166 --> 03:07:27,100
and I decided not to tell most of my team about it, because,

2272
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:34,000
you know, I didn't want them to worry. But it was tough. That was tough.

2273
03:07:35,666 --> 03:07:44,033
- Did that make you afraid of the road you were walking?

2274
03:07:46,566 --> 03:07:50,500
Meaning all the governments, all the intelligence agencies, all

2275
03:07:50,500 --> 03:07:54,466
the people. Like we mentioned, it's like you're playing a video

2276
03:07:54,566 --> 03:07:58,366
game. You started with VK where you're just trying to

2277
03:07:58,400 --> 03:08:01,466
build a thing that scales and all of a sudden you find out there's

2278
03:08:02,366 --> 03:08:06,200
DDoS attacks attacking the security,

2279
03:08:06,300 --> 03:08:10,100
the integrity of the infrastructure, and then you realize there's

2280
03:08:10,100 --> 03:08:13,766
politics, and then you realize there's geopolitics,

2281
03:08:13,900 --> 03:08:20,066
and all of these forces are interested in controlling channels of

2282
03:08:20,133 --> 03:08:27,100
communication, and you're just a curious guy who created a platform for everybody

2283
03:08:27,166 --> 03:08:30,533
on Earth to talk, and all of a sudden you realize

2284
03:08:32,200 --> 03:08:34,833
there's a lot of people attacking you.

2285
03:08:36,800 --> 03:08:42,700
How did that change your view? Did that make you more scared of the world?

2286
03:08:42,766 --> 03:08:49,266
- Interestingly, not at all. If anything, I felt even more free after that.

2287
03:08:50,300 --> 03:08:56,700
It wasn't the first time I thought I was going to die. I had

2288
03:08:59,200 --> 03:09:01,466
an experience when I assumed

2289
03:09:03,766 --> 03:09:06,866
something bad is going to happen to me a few years before that,

2290
03:09:07,900 --> 03:09:12,233
also in relation to my work. But,

2291
03:09:14,233 --> 03:09:18,133
you know, after you survive something like this, you feel like you're living on

2292
03:09:18,766 --> 03:09:24,133
bonus time, so in a way, you died a long time ago,

2293
03:09:25,366 --> 03:09:30,000
and every new day you get is a gift.

2294
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:31,033
- As a bonus.

2295
03:09:31,100 --> 03:09:32,300
- Yes.

2296
03:09:32,333 --> 03:09:35,833
- And the first time you're referring to, is that... would that have to do with

2297
03:09:35,866 --> 03:09:38,700
the complexity that was happening with the pressure

2298
03:09:39,566 --> 03:09:43,000
from the government on VK? And then you had to figure out

2299
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:46,833
the increasing pressure and you had to figure out what to do, and

2300
03:09:48,166 --> 03:09:52,500
you understood that you're losing control of VK at that moment?

2301
03:09:52,533 --> 03:09:56,200
- The first of these instances was in December 2011.

2302
03:09:56,966 --> 03:10:03,666
In December 2011, you had this huge protest on the streets of Moscow.

2303
03:10:04,566 --> 03:10:09,566
They didn't trust in the integrity of the election results

2304
03:10:10,500 --> 03:10:14,466
to the State Duma in Russia. I remember in 2011, I still lived

2305
03:10:14,500 --> 03:10:18,400
in Russia, running VK. There was no Telegram.

2306
03:10:20,400 --> 03:10:24,266
So the government demanded that we take down

2307
03:10:25,766 --> 03:10:30,400
the opposition groups of Navalny from VK that had

2308
03:10:32,066 --> 03:10:39,133
hundreds of thousands of members and that were used to organize this protest,

2309
03:10:41,300 --> 03:10:45,266
and I very publicly refused to do that.

2310
03:10:45,366 --> 03:10:48,633
I just, you know, decided it's not the right thing to do.

2311
03:10:48,666 --> 03:10:51,466
People have the right to assemble, and

2312
03:10:51,533 --> 03:10:59,666
I mocked the prosecutor who handed me that demand and put out a scan of it,

2313
03:11:01,366 --> 03:11:07,666
and next to it, a photo of a dog in a hoodie with its tongue out,

2314
03:11:08,766 --> 03:11:12,766
and I said, "This is my official response to the prosecutor's request to

2315
03:11:12,900 --> 03:11:20,133
ban opposition groups." That was very funny at the moment, but then I had armed

2316
03:11:20,266 --> 03:11:24,766
policemen trying to get into my apartment,

2317
03:11:30,100 --> 03:11:34,900
and I thought about many things at that moment. I asked myself,

2318
03:11:36,133 --> 03:11:42,733
"Did I make the right choice?" And I came to the conclusion that I made the right

2319
03:11:42,800 --> 03:11:46,066
choice, and I asked myself, "What would be the next thing

2320
03:11:48,433 --> 03:11:55,300
that would logically follow from this?" And I realized, "They're probably going to

2321
03:11:56,566 --> 03:12:01,900
put me in prison." So what am I going to do about it? I asked

2322
03:12:01,966 --> 03:12:05,833
myself. And I told myself, "I'm going to starve

2323
03:12:05,900 --> 03:12:09,966
myself, starve to death." It's something that

2324
03:12:10,900 --> 03:12:14,400
probably many men have. They're ready to die for

2325
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:21,200
other people or certain principles they strongly believe in. I'm not alone here.

2326
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:27,400
I guess Edward Snowden was ready to die as well, or some other people like Assange.

2327
03:12:29,400 --> 03:12:33,233
Also, at that moment, I realized there is no way to communicate securely.

2328
03:12:33,266 --> 03:12:37,066
I need to tell my brother what's going on. They're probably going after him.

2329
03:12:37,100 --> 03:12:42,900
How do I tell him without betraying him? Because in

2330
03:12:42,933 --> 03:12:50,166
2011, remember, WhatsApp was already there. I think they launched it in

2331
03:12:50,300 --> 03:12:57,600
2009, but it had zero encryption. All messages were plaintext

2332
03:12:57,633 --> 03:13:04,100
in transit, meaning that even your system administrator, let alone your

2333
03:13:04,200 --> 03:13:07,600
carrier, had access to your messages.

2334
03:13:09,533 --> 03:13:15,833
It was only after Telegram started this push for encryption that these other apps

2335
03:13:16,666 --> 03:13:21,033
suddenly remembered that privacy was in their DNA,

2336
03:13:22,966 --> 03:13:28,566
as WhatsApp founders famously stated, but it must have been a dormant gene.

2337
03:13:30,100 --> 03:13:34,300
in 2011. So in 2011, there was no way...

2338
03:13:36,200 --> 03:13:40,200
to send a message in a secure way. And I also told

2339
03:13:40,233 --> 03:13:44,033
myself, "If I'm going to survive this, I'm definitely

2340
03:13:44,100 --> 03:13:48,166
launching a secure messaging app." Somehow

2341
03:13:49,133 --> 03:13:53,233
it ended up not being too bad. I was summoned to the prosecutor,

2342
03:13:55,800 --> 03:14:01,333
answered some silly questions, fewer questions that I had to answer

2343
03:14:02,933 --> 03:14:06,800
more recently in the French investigation case.

2344
03:14:08,533 --> 03:14:13,266
But it was the beginning of the end. It was clear that

2345
03:14:15,933 --> 03:14:21,466
there's no way I'm going to be allowed to run VK the way I wanted it to run.

2346
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:27,900
That was the moment I packed my backpack

2347
03:14:29,433 --> 03:14:35,800
and just started to wait. I moved to a hotel

2348
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:41,400
and realized any day I can leave the country. I kept

2349
03:14:43,100 --> 03:14:48,800
running VK. I started to design Telegram

2350
03:14:49,800 --> 03:15:01,233
and assembling the team, but I knew my days in Russia were numbered.

2351
03:15:01,300 --> 03:15:05,700
- Well, first, I really have to say for myself,

2352
03:15:06,566 --> 03:15:10,733
millions, maybe hundreds of millions, maybe the entirety of Earth, thank you

2353
03:15:11,600 --> 03:15:15,500
for putting your life on the line in those cases. I think freedom of speech is fundamental to

2354
03:15:15,533 --> 03:15:21,500
the flourishing of humanity, so. And it depends on people

2355
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:26,500
willing to put everything on the line for their principles. So, thank you.

2356
03:15:26,533 --> 03:15:33,366
Quick pause. I need a bathroom break. All right. We're back, and once

2357
03:15:33,400 --> 03:15:37,100
again, we had a super long day, and the fact that you would

2358
03:15:37,200 --> 03:15:40,400
spend many hours with me, thank you for powering

2359
03:15:40,433 --> 03:15:45,100
through. We got this. It's already late at night.

2360
03:15:45,300 --> 03:15:46,900
- Thanks for doing this.

2361
03:15:46,966 --> 03:15:55,133
- Okay. So there is increasing indication, I think, from things I've seen

2362
03:15:55,133 --> 03:15:58,900
online that Russia is considering banning Telegram.

2363
03:15:59,433 --> 03:16:03,400
First of all, do you think this might happen? And what effect do you think this might

2364
03:16:03,433 --> 03:16:07,933
have on humanity? And, in general, what do you think about this?

2365
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:11,966
- It can definitely happen. As you said, there are certain indications. There have

2366
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:18,933
been certain test attempts to partially ban it. Telegram is no longer

2367
03:16:19,000 --> 03:16:23,700
accessible in parts of Russia, such as Dagestan. It would be incredibly sad

2368
03:16:24,533 --> 03:16:28,700
if Russia restores its attempts to

2369
03:16:29,633 --> 03:16:35,200
ban Telegram, because currently it's being used by its population for all kinds of purposes,

2370
03:16:35,233 --> 03:16:41,433
not just personal communication or economic business activities. But also, it's

2371
03:16:41,500 --> 03:16:47,333
communication or economic business activities. But also, it's

2372
03:16:48,566 --> 03:16:55,200
the only platform which allows the Russian people to access independent sources of information.

2373
03:16:55,233 --> 03:17:02,300
If you think about media outlets such as BBC or any other non-Russian sources of information,

2374
03:17:03,633 --> 03:17:09,800
they're only accessible in Russia through Telegram in the form of Telegram channels.

2375
03:17:09,833 --> 03:17:22,333
The websites are banned. Some other social media sites are banned. And as you said,

2376
03:17:22,366 --> 03:17:26,966
like, there are indications that Russia is

2377
03:17:27,933 --> 03:17:34,600
planning to migrate users from existing messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram

2378
03:17:34,666 --> 03:17:38,833
to their own homegrown tool,

2379
03:17:40,200 --> 03:17:44,700
which would, of course, be fully transparent to the government

2380
03:17:45,733 --> 03:17:51,100
and wouldn't allow voices independent from the government to express themselves.

2381
03:17:51,133 --> 03:17:58,400
It's certainly an alarming trend. We see these attempts in countries that are not famous for

2382
03:17:59,000 --> 03:18:01,866
countries that are not famous for

2383
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:07,700
protecting freedom of speech, but also increasingly in countries that

2384
03:18:09,033 --> 03:18:13,933
have been known to protect freedoms. And this creates this

2385
03:18:15,633 --> 03:18:19,200
vicious circle, because in a way

2386
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:24,400
European countries trying to fight freedom of speech

2387
03:18:26,200 --> 03:18:31,233
under pretext that sound legitimate, such as combating

2388
03:18:31,266 --> 03:18:35,666
misinformation or election interference. They create precedents,

2389
03:18:36,733 --> 03:18:42,933
and they legitimize restrictions to freedom of speech, which then, in turn,

2390
03:18:43,333 --> 03:18:49,366
can be used by authoritarian regimes. And they would say,

2391
03:18:50,133 --> 03:18:55,700
in places like China or Iran that

2392
03:18:56,766 --> 03:19:06,200
they're not doing anything different. It's the norm now to restrict voices that

2393
03:19:07,533 --> 03:19:10,000
that don't go in line with the mainstream narrative.

2394
03:19:11,800 --> 03:19:14,633
That's sad, because one of the things that makes

2395
03:19:15,700 --> 03:19:21,333
our life interesting is this abundance of different

2396
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:29,400
viewpoints, of different people that we get to experience. You limit the

2397
03:19:29,433 --> 03:19:32,733
freedom of people, you inevitably decelerate

2398
03:19:33,400 --> 03:19:36,800
economic growth, level of happiness, the way people

2399
03:19:36,900 --> 03:19:40,433
can contribute to society, the way people can express

2400
03:19:40,466 --> 03:19:43,966
themselves. I personally think it would be a huge mistake

2401
03:19:45,400 --> 03:19:47,100
to ban a tool like Telegram

2402
03:19:49,200 --> 03:19:53,133
in any country, particularly a large country such as Russia, because

2403
03:19:53,166 --> 03:20:00,500
the Russian people are incredibly talented and resilient people. They are among the

2404
03:20:00,700 --> 03:20:07,333
first to start utilizing some of these recent innovations that Telegram

2405
03:20:07,433 --> 03:20:13,133
implements. They are the early adopters. I'd say them and

2406
03:20:14,400 --> 03:20:19,000
also the Americans, perhaps other people from Eastern Europe like Ukrainians

2407
03:20:20,100 --> 03:20:23,766
and Southeast Asians. They're among the first people to start

2408
03:20:23,866 --> 03:20:32,333
using any new addition that we launch. They're incredibly hungry for innovation.

2409
03:20:32,400 --> 03:20:34,100
- So all that said there's

2410
03:20:35,666 --> 03:20:39,633
as part of the propaganda, and in general, there's attacks on you all over the place.

2411
03:20:39,666 --> 03:20:43,566
There's misinformation. I've read a bunch of things that

2412
03:20:43,600 --> 03:20:51,700
are, I think, in a systematic way, lying about you, lying about Telegram

2413
03:20:51,766 --> 03:20:55,933
from all angles. Why do you get attacked so much by everybody?

2414
03:20:56,133 --> 03:21:02,766
- Well, protecting freedom of speech is not a way to make a lot of friends.

2415
03:21:03,533 --> 03:21:07,566
Because you would inevitably find yourself in a situation where

2416
03:21:10,266 --> 03:21:14,033
you would be protecting the freedom of the

2417
03:21:14,100 --> 03:21:18,333
opposition to the current government in any country

2418
03:21:20,766 --> 03:21:26,600
to express themselves. And then the initial reaction and a very

2419
03:21:27,833 --> 03:21:36,233
basic, instinctive reaction of any government would be to say, "Oh, our opposition

2420
03:21:37,800 --> 03:21:41,233
shouldn't be trusted and allowed to express themselves, because they're

2421
03:21:42,866 --> 03:21:46,433
actually agents of some foreign

2422
03:21:46,733 --> 03:21:50,366
rival, a geopolitical force that wants to destroy our

2423
03:21:50,400 --> 03:21:57,200
country." This is something that every authoritarian regime in history used. You take

2424
03:21:57,233 --> 03:22:05,933
Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany, Maoist China. They'd

2425
03:22:07,066 --> 03:22:10,900
always use the same trick. They'd say, "We need to limit your freedom of speech,

2426
03:22:11,000 --> 03:22:16,133
because these people who are masquerading as opposition are

2427
03:22:16,200 --> 03:22:21,300
actually the agents of this other country that wants to take

2428
03:22:21,366 --> 03:22:25,200
over. That's why, dear citizens, forget about your

2429
03:22:25,200 --> 03:22:29,933
freedoms." And now increasingly, you see similar attempts in

2430
03:22:30,900 --> 03:22:36,300
free countries. The initial instinct from, say, President Macron's team

2431
03:22:37,200 --> 03:22:41,133
when they're confronted with some footage,

2432
03:22:41,200 --> 03:22:46,366
for example, the footage of his wife slapping him, would be to say it's all fake

2433
03:22:48,033 --> 03:22:52,833
Russian imagery, something that is

2434
03:22:54,000 --> 03:23:01,400
inaccurate, something that is misinformation or interference. And then when they are

2435
03:23:01,433 --> 03:23:08,466
confronted with more information, they have to refine the narrative. So when

2436
03:23:11,033 --> 03:23:14,500
you find yourself in a situation that you're running this platform

2437
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:20,333
like Telegram, and then you protect the freedom to express

2438
03:23:21,433 --> 03:23:30,433
ideas that don't go in line with the mainstream narrative, you often find yourself

2439
03:23:32,500 --> 03:23:38,633
in this crossfire when the forces in power will say that

2440
03:23:38,700 --> 03:23:42,300
you must be working with some foreign government that they don't

2441
03:23:42,333 --> 03:23:45,966
like. Inevitably they would say that.

2442
03:23:46,033 --> 03:23:50,000
"Oh, if you're protecting these voices, it's not right."

2443
03:23:50,033 --> 03:23:55,733
They love you when you're protecting the freedom of speech in a country

2444
03:23:56,833 --> 03:24:00,800
that is far from them, or better yet, in a country

2445
03:24:00,866 --> 03:24:04,633
that is their geopolitical rival. They praise you for that, but

2446
03:24:04,666 --> 03:24:09,866
then they have this bipolar attitude

2447
03:24:11,366 --> 03:24:15,300
when you do the same in their own country. And they say, "No, no, no,

2448
03:24:15,333 --> 03:24:19,300
no, no. We loved you for protecting freedom of speech, but not here.

2449
03:24:19,400 --> 03:24:22,866
Not in my backyard. We don't need it here. We're all

2450
03:24:22,933 --> 03:24:31,600
right. We have free press." And then you will find yourself in this weird spot and

2451
03:24:31,666 --> 03:24:34,900
Ukrainians say you work for the Russians, the Russians say you work for the

2452
03:24:34,966 --> 03:24:43,800
Ukrainians. And all this schizophrenia is something that we had to deal with

2453
03:24:43,966 --> 03:24:50,300
for some time, because it's a very easy way to attack you. At

2454
03:24:50,433 --> 03:24:57,200
some point you don't understand where it is coming from. Is it our

2455
03:24:57,233 --> 03:25:01,000
competitors? And we must give credit to our competitors if

2456
03:25:01,066 --> 03:25:04,300
it's their invention to launch these kind of rumors, because

2457
03:25:06,466 --> 03:25:12,200
at a certain point they must have realized they can't compete technologically

2458
03:25:13,400 --> 03:25:17,333
on the product side, so they must do something like this. Or

2459
03:25:17,366 --> 03:25:20,800
it's just governments launching these rumors, trying to discredit the

2460
03:25:20,866 --> 03:25:24,833
platform, trying to scare their citizens away from

2461
03:25:24,900 --> 03:25:32,433
it, because they understand that their power and grip over their own country is in

2462
03:25:32,466 --> 03:25:39,066
danger, as long as they allow a pro-freedom platform to operate.

2463
03:25:39,100 --> 03:25:42,866
- And through all of this, we should say over and over that you are

2464
03:25:42,966 --> 03:25:46,966
simply preserving the freedom of speech for all

2465
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:49,866
people of Earth, no matter what they believe,

2466
03:25:51,066 --> 03:25:54,233
as long as they don't call for violence and as long as they're not

2467
03:25:54,266 --> 03:25:58,000
doing some of the criminal activity that we discussed, including terrorist

2468
03:25:58,600 --> 03:26:02,400
organizing. But other than that, it doesn't matter what their belief, left wing or right

2469
03:26:02,433 --> 03:26:06,166
wing. You're just preserving their freedom of speech. You think people of Ukraine, people of

2470
03:26:06,200 --> 03:26:09,866
Russia, and people of Iran, people of all over the world understand

2471
03:26:09,900 --> 03:26:14,033
that, despite the propaganda against you?

2472
03:26:14,100 --> 03:26:17,766
- I think people are smart. Every time I meet

2473
03:26:17,800 --> 03:26:21,366
somebody from one of these countries you mentioned, in real life, people

2474
03:26:21,400 --> 03:26:28,566
recognize me in the street. Say here in Dubai, they come over, they seem

2475
03:26:28,633 --> 03:26:35,566
incredibly grateful and understanding. The propaganda in each of these countries

2476
03:26:37,033 --> 03:26:41,500
would tell them a number of things, but they learned to discount it.

2477
03:26:42,700 --> 03:26:48,866
That's why they're so happy that Telegram exists, is because the way they can

2478
03:26:50,900 --> 03:26:55,166
understand the world around them is to receive

2479
03:26:56,033 --> 03:27:03,633
conflicting, mutually exclusive viewpoints from sources that hate each other,

2480
03:27:03,700 --> 03:27:07,466
and try to understand what really is

2481
03:27:07,466 --> 03:27:10,466
true, because there's no such thing as an unbiased source of

2482
03:27:10,533 --> 03:27:17,966
information. When the war in Ukraine started in 2022,

2483
03:27:19,866 --> 03:27:23,500
I instantly realized Telegram is going to be used

2484
03:27:24,366 --> 03:27:27,766
to spread propaganda by both sides,

2485
03:27:30,433 --> 03:27:34,266
and I didn't want Telegram to be used as a tool for war.

2486
03:27:34,366 --> 03:27:38,800
I said, and I posted it publicly, I suggested maybe we should just

2487
03:27:41,366 --> 03:27:44,900
suspend the activity of all politics- related

2488
03:27:45,000 --> 03:27:48,033
channels in both countries for the time of the war.

2489
03:27:50,566 --> 03:27:53,433
Maybe we shouldn't have channels in these two countries.

2490
03:27:55,200 --> 03:28:04,733
And then, interestingly, people from both countries revolted against this.

2491
03:28:07,000 --> 03:28:13,300
They told me, both people in Ukraine and in Russia, that I don't get to babysit them

2492
03:28:14,366 --> 03:28:19,166
and decide for them what sources of information that

2493
03:28:20,133 --> 03:28:25,700
they have to be granted access to. They are grownups that can

2494
03:28:26,733 --> 03:28:30,233
make these decisions for themselves. They

2495
03:28:30,266 --> 03:28:32,900
understand that there is a lot of propaganda.

2496
03:28:33,766 --> 03:28:40,600
They learn to see through this propaganda. They learn to be able to tell truth from

2497
03:28:40,666 --> 03:28:45,433
lie. And in this time of war, it was particularly valuable for them

2498
03:28:46,900 --> 03:28:53,700
to receive as much information as possible, because their relatives, their friends

2499
03:28:55,333 --> 03:28:59,166
were getting affected and are still getting affected. They

2500
03:28:59,200 --> 03:29:00,600
want to understand what was going on.

2501
03:29:02,200 --> 03:29:05,600
At that point, I realized people are smart, people get it.

2502
03:29:07,066 --> 03:29:11,066
People can see through it. If you ask most people in any of these

2503
03:29:11,100 --> 03:29:12,633
countries, "Do you agree that

2504
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:19,300
access to Telegram should be restricted for whatever reason?" They would say no.

2505
03:29:19,366 --> 03:29:21,000
- They hunger to have a voice.

2506
03:29:21,500 --> 03:29:27,166
- They need a voice and they need a place to share their opinion securely.

2507
03:29:28,166 --> 03:29:31,666
- I have to ask you, on the question of leadership in

2508
03:29:31,766 --> 03:29:39,366
the LaPointe interview, the journalist said that you're often compared to Elon Musk.

2509
03:29:39,466 --> 03:29:43,300
And you highlighted some interesting nuances around that, that you're

2510
03:29:43,300 --> 03:29:47,100
quite different; that Elon runs several companies at once

2511
03:29:47,166 --> 03:29:50,800
while you only run one, and Elon can

2512
03:29:50,866 --> 03:29:54,833
lean more on the emotional side while you deliberate and

2513
03:29:54,866 --> 03:29:57,800
think deeply before acting. Can you expand on

2514
03:29:57,833 --> 03:30:01,466
this? Also, there's an interesting point that you made that

2515
03:30:01,533 --> 03:30:05,133
everybody's weakness is also a strength. Everybody's strength is also a

2516
03:30:05,133 --> 03:30:11,800
weakness. There's a dual nature to all our characteristics. So, on the

2517
03:30:11,833 --> 03:30:15,766
topic of Elon, what have you learned from his style

2518
03:30:15,866 --> 03:30:20,066
of leadership? What do you respect about him?

2519
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:25,133
- First of all, I don't think there is such thing as

2520
03:30:26,466 --> 03:30:29,966
a negative personal trait. In most cases, our

2521
03:30:30,966 --> 03:30:34,300
bad traits and our good traits are the same trait or at least have the same

2522
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:38,800
source. Of course, there are some extreme examples, but

2523
03:30:39,600 --> 03:30:46,933
I'd say 99% of people, if you analyze their character, their bravery can be seen

2524
03:30:46,966 --> 03:30:50,566
in recklessness in other situations. Depending on circumstances,

2525
03:30:51,733 --> 03:30:59,633
you would see exactly the same personality trait, and it would be either a good

2526
03:30:59,666 --> 03:31:03,400
thing or a bad thing, because humanity is perfect

2527
03:31:04,333 --> 03:31:10,566
as a whole and each of us is different for a reason. We have evolved to be

2528
03:31:10,600 --> 03:31:18,700
different, to complement each other's abilities so that together we are invincible.

2529
03:31:20,666 --> 03:31:23,633
And even if you take a person

2530
03:31:25,100 --> 03:31:31,866
as complicated as Elon, I believe that certain traits that Elon

2531
03:31:31,933 --> 03:31:37,866
demonstrates, that people criticize about him, are

2532
03:31:37,900 --> 03:31:43,300
also the sources of his strength. For example, his emotionality

2533
03:31:44,900 --> 03:31:48,500
is derived from the fact that he cares about issues deeply

2534
03:31:50,100 --> 03:31:55,066
and he is willing to start as many wars and as many fights as it takes

2535
03:31:56,066 --> 03:32:00,833
to change the world in the direction that he thinks is right.

2536
03:32:01,766 --> 03:32:05,166
He also seems to be able to extract motivation

2537
03:32:06,166 --> 03:32:12,466
from all these wars and personal conflicts, which is, again, not something to be

2538
03:32:13,200 --> 03:32:18,900
underestimated. At a certain point in the life of a

2539
03:32:18,966 --> 03:32:22,733
successful entrepreneur, the question of

2540
03:32:22,800 --> 03:32:27,666
motivation starts to be the primary question. If we're talking about the most

2541
03:32:29,100 --> 03:32:33,066
richest person in the world and the most famous entrepreneur in

2542
03:32:33,100 --> 03:32:42,200
the world, you have to wonder, how does he motivate himself? And if starting

2543
03:32:45,466 --> 03:32:49,700
a war on X, debating certain issues,

2544
03:32:51,300 --> 03:32:58,700
or becoming personal with other CEOs, criticizing them, if these activities help

2545
03:32:59,200 --> 03:33:02,233
Elon to innovate

2546
03:33:04,633 --> 03:33:11,466
and start new projects, he should be doing more of it. There's nothing wrong in

2547
03:33:13,266 --> 03:33:20,100
being non-agreeable. Actually, it's one of the main traits of a successful

2548
03:33:20,100 --> 03:33:23,366
entrepreneur, not agreeing with things.

2549
03:33:24,833 --> 03:33:28,600
And every time somebody like Elon... But there is no somebody like Elon. There's just

2550
03:33:28,700 --> 03:33:32,500
Elon. I think, at least from the entrepreneurs I

2551
03:33:32,500 --> 03:33:39,233
know and I personally interacted with, he's unique in the sense that he keeps

2552
03:33:40,066 --> 03:33:43,666
launching new things, running them in parallel,

2553
03:33:45,266 --> 03:33:51,466
and he doesn't seem to be stretched too thin. Well, some people think he is, but

2554
03:33:53,166 --> 03:34:02,533
he manages to still demonstrate success in all or most of his endeavors.

2555
03:34:03,666 --> 03:34:07,433
So again, you can criticize Elon for being emotional, but would he be the

2556
03:34:07,500 --> 03:34:12,466
same person without this? I doubt that.

2557
03:34:12,500 --> 03:34:15,966
- and the incredible teams he's motivated too. There's an element of that,

2558
03:34:16,666 --> 03:34:21,533
which you've spoken about. The team at Telegram, you know,

2559
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:26,900
assembling a team of A-players, as

2560
03:34:26,966 --> 03:34:30,833
we've talked about, is a skill in itself. And that's also a

2561
03:34:30,866 --> 03:34:36,000
big part of the the leaders that we've discussed, is like what,

2562
03:34:36,833 --> 03:34:39,366
judged in part by the team you assemble.

2563
03:34:39,400 --> 03:34:44,100
- Yes. And one of the necessary character features to enable that is

2564
03:34:45,166 --> 03:34:50,666
to be ready to be unpleasant. You have to be ready to insult some people

2565
03:34:51,700 --> 03:34:56,833
if their work is inferior. You have to be ready to fire

2566
03:34:56,866 --> 03:35:02,266
them without remorse. So in order to be

2567
03:35:02,400 --> 03:35:06,766
an efficient and great entrepreneur and enrich the world of innovations,

2568
03:35:08,666 --> 03:35:13,366
you have to do unpleasant things. Most people will shy away from it. And

2569
03:35:17,066 --> 03:35:23,800
in a certain sense, entrepreneurs sacrifice their peace of mind in order to

2570
03:35:26,266 --> 03:35:31,566
contribute to the world around them. And Elon is a great example of that.

2571
03:35:31,633 --> 03:35:34,466
- I have to ask you about the big picture of Telegram.

2572
03:35:34,566 --> 03:35:39,066
We've already talked about the fact that you own 100% of it,

2573
03:35:40,033 --> 03:35:43,733
and there's a lot on the business side of it. The business structure of Telegram is

2574
03:35:43,800 --> 03:35:51,066
fascinating. You've invested 100, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars of your own

2575
03:35:51,100 --> 03:35:56,166
money. As far as I know, you take a salary of what? $1?

2576
03:35:57,200 --> 03:36:01,200
- One dirham is one-third of that.

2577
03:36:01,266 --> 03:36:06,900
- One-third of a dollar. And in 2024 was the first time

2578
03:36:07,100 --> 03:36:10,833
Telegram was profitable. So one of the interesting questions is,

2579
03:36:10,866 --> 03:36:14,866
here, that we could talk for many hours about, but I'd love to get a high-level

2580
03:36:15,133 --> 03:36:17,966
view picture. You've left what I

2581
03:36:18,633 --> 03:36:22,266
understand, what I think is a huge amount of money on the table

2582
03:36:22,833 --> 03:36:26,633
by sticking to your principles. For example, not doing advertisement

2583
03:36:27,133 --> 03:36:30,966
that's based on user private data, which basically every

2584
03:36:31,066 --> 03:36:34,766
social media company does. So, the only advertisement that

2585
03:36:34,766 --> 03:36:38,633
Telegram does is based on channels and groups, based on the topic,

2586
03:36:38,700 --> 03:36:42,666
not the private data of the individuals. And the other thing

2587
03:36:42,766 --> 03:36:46,666
is, which is also gangster and incredible, is you

2588
03:36:46,666 --> 03:36:51,133
don't do a news feed, which is the most addictive and

2589
03:36:52,166 --> 03:36:59,866
engagement-inducing aspect of social media, which feeds the very kind of addictive

2590
03:36:59,933 --> 03:37:05,333
downside of the internet: the distraction, the engagement drama, farming

2591
03:37:06,633 --> 03:37:10,433
aspect that we've talked about in the very beginning that you try to resist,

2592
03:37:10,533 --> 03:37:14,400
that you think is damaging the human mind at scale. So anyway, that's

2593
03:37:14,466 --> 03:37:18,333
just speaking to the fact that you're leaving a lot of money on the table. So,

2594
03:37:18,366 --> 03:37:22,233
how the hell were you able to be profitable? What are the ways that Telegram

2595
03:37:22,266 --> 03:37:23,466
makes money?

2596
03:37:23,500 --> 03:37:29,433
- Yeah. We had to innovate a lot in order to reach a point where we are profitable

2597
03:37:31,400 --> 03:37:37,966
without having to resort to dubious business activities involving

2598
03:37:38,333 --> 03:37:46,833
exploiting personal data of users, something that most of our competitors do.

2599
03:37:47,966 --> 03:37:55,366
Because money has never been the primary goal, at least not for me. When I sold

2600
03:37:56,733 --> 03:38:03,633
the remaining share of my first company, I had to do it below market price because

2601
03:38:05,533 --> 03:38:08,766
I didn't leave Russia completely without any pressures, you know?

2602
03:38:11,233 --> 03:38:16,600
I reinvested the vast majority of everything in Telegram.

2603
03:38:18,933 --> 03:38:22,800
Telegram is an operation that is losing money for me personally. I

2604
03:38:22,866 --> 03:38:27,766
never... I didn't extract more from Telegram than I invested in it. I never

2605
03:38:28,566 --> 03:38:31,766
sold a single share.

2606
03:38:33,333 --> 03:38:36,933
But I also didn't want to sell Telegram, so how do you reach a point when you're

2607
03:38:36,933 --> 03:38:40,766
profitable without sacrificing your values?

2608
03:38:40,866 --> 03:38:43,866
One of the ideas we explored was a subscription

2609
03:38:43,933 --> 03:38:47,666
model, but only for certain additional

2610
03:38:47,766 --> 03:38:54,666
features. We wanted to keep all the existing features free, and just add

2611
03:38:55,766 --> 03:39:02,133
more business-related tools or tools for advanced users

2612
03:39:02,666 --> 03:39:07,600
that they would have to pay for, say, four or five dollars a month.

2613
03:39:09,366 --> 03:39:14,166
It was quite unprecedented at the time. It wasn't considered

2614
03:39:14,466 --> 03:39:18,400
a viable option for messaging apps to do that. We launched the

2615
03:39:18,466 --> 03:39:24,633
premium subscriptions for Telegram in 2022,

2616
03:39:25,633 --> 03:39:32,033
and now we have over 15 million paid subscribers. This is

2617
03:39:33,566 --> 03:39:38,733
some very significant recurring revenue. So, we would

2618
03:39:38,766 --> 03:39:45,633
receive more than half a billion dollars from premium subscriptions

2619
03:39:45,700 --> 03:39:50,266
alone this year, and it's growing fast.

2620
03:39:51,766 --> 03:39:56,466
For that, we had to innovate a lot. We included over 50 different features

2621
03:39:57,466 --> 03:40:01,166
into the premium package. And then, how do you

2622
03:40:02,166 --> 03:40:06,000
make an app that is already more powerful than any other

2623
03:40:06,066 --> 03:40:07,433
messaging app on the market

2624
03:40:10,566 --> 03:40:13,866
even more useful so that people would be ready to pay for this

2625
03:40:14,633 --> 03:40:18,666
extra? That wasn't easy. That took a lot of effort.

2626
03:40:18,966 --> 03:40:20,666
- And you're constantly adding features.

2627
03:40:20,700 --> 03:40:21,900
- We're constantly adding features.

2628
03:40:21,933 --> 03:40:25,533
- That's actually fun to watch, just the rate of adding... And some of them are

2629
03:40:25,566 --> 03:40:32,400
subtle, like the updates to improvements, expansions of polls, for example.

2630
03:40:32,433 --> 03:40:35,733
- Yes. You keep improving the existing features and adding new

2631
03:40:35,800 --> 03:40:40,733
ones, and every time when you add a new feature, you don't want to clutter the app.

2632
03:40:41,333 --> 03:40:47,433
So, in a way, they're not in your way. They're invisible. That's not an

2633
03:40:47,466 --> 03:40:51,066
easy thing to do. And most of the features maybe are not even known

2634
03:40:51,766 --> 03:40:55,700
to the majority of our users. But when you need them, they're there.

2635
03:40:56,533 --> 03:41:00,466
So, premium is one source of our revenue. We also have ads,

2636
03:41:00,533 --> 03:41:06,400
but they're context-based, not targeted. Of course, we leave probably

2637
03:41:07,666 --> 03:41:14,533
80% of value on the table because we are not ready to engage in all those practices,

2638
03:41:14,566 --> 03:41:15,833
exporting personal data.

2639
03:41:15,866 --> 03:41:19,266
- Just to be clear, targeted ads is what most

2640
03:41:19,933 --> 03:41:23,600
social media companies, most tech companies that do any kind of advertisement

2641
03:41:23,633 --> 03:41:29,733
do, and that's the kind of advertisement that uses personal data from users,

2642
03:41:30,600 --> 03:41:34,633
just to clarify. And when you said 80%, that's a lot of money.

2643
03:41:34,666 --> 03:41:38,266
- Of course, because we would never use, for example, your personal

2644
03:41:38,366 --> 03:41:42,333
messaging data, or your contacts data, or your

2645
03:41:42,400 --> 03:41:46,400
metadata, or your activity data to target ads.

2646
03:41:47,666 --> 03:41:53,166
It's sad that it became synonymous with the internet

2647
03:41:53,266 --> 03:42:00,066
industry, this kind of exploitation, but we are happy

2648
03:42:00,066 --> 03:42:03,800
with the fact that we managed to make Telegram profitable despite

2649
03:42:03,833 --> 03:42:07,800
that. We're also experimenting a lot with

2650
03:42:08,700 --> 03:42:12,366
blockchain-based technologies. We're the first

2651
03:42:12,900 --> 03:42:16,133
app to allow people to directly own their username and

2652
03:42:16,233 --> 03:42:19,400
their digital identities using smart

2653
03:42:19,500 --> 03:42:23,366
contracts and NFTs, removing Telegram from the picture.

2654
03:42:23,400 --> 03:42:27,100
So, for example, Telegram cannot confiscate

2655
03:42:27,300 --> 03:42:34,766
your username from you. It's impossible. We do a lot of things related to

2656
03:42:35,900 --> 03:42:39,600
the ecosystem of Telegram. We have a thriving mini app

2657
03:42:39,866 --> 03:42:47,866
platform, millions of mini app developers launching their own bots and applications.

2658
03:42:48,266 --> 03:42:52,933
- So, a lot of people are making millions of dollars on the Telegram platform?

2659
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:56,700
- Yes, we enable them to receive

2660
03:42:58,300 --> 03:43:05,633
payments from the users through in-app purchase mechanisms provided by Apple and

2661
03:43:05,666 --> 03:43:10,966
Google, which I think was the first attempt of this kind

2662
03:43:12,566 --> 03:43:16,366
to allow that both on iOS and Android, and on a big platform, so

2663
03:43:16,400 --> 03:43:19,700
that third-party developers of mini apps, which are basically

2664
03:43:20,033 --> 03:43:23,666
websites so deeply integrated into Telegram

2665
03:43:24,033 --> 03:43:27,933
that you can't tell whether they're standalone or

2666
03:43:27,966 --> 03:43:33,400
they're part of the overall experience. And by providing this

2667
03:43:34,466 --> 03:43:43,533
payment option, we are able to extract a commission from these transactions. But

2668
03:43:43,566 --> 03:43:50,200
it's a very low commission. Presently, it's 5%. So we aren't greedy

2669
03:43:50,266 --> 03:43:53,800
here. We want people to succeed

2670
03:43:54,733 --> 03:44:01,100
in building these tools for our users. We understand that mini apps bring us users.

2671
03:44:03,266 --> 03:44:06,966
The more users we have, the more successful and relevant

2672
03:44:07,500 --> 03:44:11,466
Telegram becomes. We need third-party developers. I think,

2673
03:44:11,500 --> 03:44:18,900
at this point, Telegram gives developers, by far, the most powerful

2674
03:44:18,900 --> 03:44:20,966
tools to create.

2675
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:24,966
- Plus, there's a bot API, and you have to tell me about the TON

2676
03:44:25,066 --> 03:44:28,266
blockchain and the crypto ecosystem available through

2677
03:44:28,333 --> 03:44:34,200
Telegram. So what is TON, also known as, the Open Network Blockchain?

2678
03:44:34,266 --> 03:44:40,233
- TON is a blockchain technology that we initially developed in 2018 and 2019,

2679
03:44:41,066 --> 03:44:45,000
and we started to develop it because we needed a blockchain platform to

2680
03:44:45,066 --> 03:44:48,800
be integrated deeply into Telegram because we believe in

2681
03:44:48,800 --> 03:44:52,300
blockchain. We think it's one of the technologies that enable

2682
03:44:52,400 --> 03:45:00,233
freedom. But, at the time, if you look at Bitcoin, if you look at Ethereum, they were

2683
03:45:00,300 --> 03:45:04,166
not scalable enough to cope with the load that

2684
03:45:04,500 --> 03:45:09,366
our hundreds of millions of users would create. They would just become congested.

2685
03:45:10,833 --> 03:45:14,766
And I asked my brother, "Can we create a blockchain platform

2686
03:45:15,466 --> 03:45:21,866
that would be inherently scalable so that no matter how many users or transactions

2687
03:45:21,900 --> 03:45:25,900
there are, it would split into smaller pieces, which we

2688
03:45:25,933 --> 03:45:29,400
call shard chains, and would still process all

2689
03:45:29,466 --> 03:45:33,200
transactions?" And he thought for a few days and said,

2690
03:45:33,233 --> 03:45:37,000
"Yes, it's possible, but it's not easy." When we started building it,

2691
03:45:37,100 --> 03:45:41,733
we ended up succeeding in developing that technology, but we couldn't release it

2692
03:45:43,066 --> 03:45:50,100
because the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the

2693
03:45:50,166 --> 03:45:53,933
United States was unhappy with the way

2694
03:45:56,700 --> 03:46:02,633
the fundraise for TON was conducted. So we had to abandon the

2695
03:46:02,666 --> 03:46:10,366
project, and the open-source community took over. Luckily, because we

2696
03:46:10,400 --> 03:46:14,400
constantly conducted those contests with third-party

2697
03:46:14,433 --> 03:46:19,100
developers, there was a thriving community around TON,

2698
03:46:20,833 --> 03:46:24,766
which now stood for The Open Network as opposed to

2699
03:46:24,800 --> 03:46:30,233
its prior name, Telegram Open Network. And so this project

2700
03:46:31,633 --> 03:46:38,733
got eventually launched without our direct involvement, and it's

2701
03:46:38,966 --> 03:46:46,433
thriving now because everything we do, like I said, is blockchain-based,

2702
03:46:46,466 --> 03:46:50,466
tokenized, usernames, Telegram accounts

2703
03:46:51,400 --> 03:46:54,933
are all based on TON and its smart contracts.

2704
03:46:54,966 --> 03:46:59,566
It's the only way for third-party developers and creators

2705
03:47:02,300 --> 03:47:04,833
to withdraw the funds that they

2706
03:47:05,933 --> 03:47:09,733
earn through our revenue-sharing programs. For example, with

2707
03:47:09,766 --> 03:47:15,500
channel owners, we do a 50/50 split of ad revenues.

2708
03:47:16,633 --> 03:47:19,600
It's also the only way to transact on Telegram. For

2709
03:47:19,666 --> 03:47:24,500
example, if you want to buy ads on Telegram, you should use TON.

2710
03:47:25,600 --> 03:47:31,466
All the new things we launch, for example, gifts that we mentioned

2711
03:47:31,500 --> 03:47:40,200
earlier, which you can define as a reinvented socially relevant NFT

2712
03:47:41,266 --> 03:47:48,133
integrated into a billion-user ecosystem, but at the same time, available on-chain,

2713
03:47:48,200 --> 03:47:55,500
transferable, which you can own directly, also based on TON. Incredibly

2714
03:47:56,200 --> 03:48:03,433
fast-growing space. We only launched them about half a year ago. And now as a result of

2715
03:48:03,500 --> 03:48:11,233
these Telegram gifts, TON has become, I think, the largest or the second-largest

2716
03:48:12,300 --> 03:48:18,466
blockchain in terms of daily NFT trading volumes.

2717
03:48:19,033 --> 03:48:23,000
- So, like you mentioned, it is a Layer 1 technology as opposed

2718
03:48:23,033 --> 03:48:26,833
to being built on top of Ethereum or Bitcoin. And it's able to

2719
03:48:26,933 --> 03:48:30,466
achieve the scale and the speed of transactions that's

2720
03:48:30,533 --> 03:48:33,966
needed for something like Telegram. And like you also

2721
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:37,333
mentioned, the gifts. You recently launched

2722
03:48:39,233 --> 03:48:46,466
some Snoop Dogg gifts. Are there going to be some other celebrities in the pipeline?

2723
03:48:46,533 --> 03:48:50,466
- Yeah, I'm a big fan of Snoop, and that's why when they reached out,

2724
03:48:50,533 --> 03:48:53,266
suggesting to do something together, I said, "Let's launch some

2725
03:48:53,566 --> 03:48:59,400
Snoop-related gifts." And it was really fun. We managed to sell

2726
03:49:00,333 --> 03:49:04,466
12 million worth of gifts within 30 minutes.

2727
03:49:04,500 --> 03:49:08,933
- 30 minutes. Well, there you go. I even got a few, but yeah.

2728
03:49:08,933 --> 03:49:15,600
- After this, we have many requests from many really high-profile influencers

2729
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:19,000
that, in a way, are lining up.

2730
03:49:19,066 --> 03:49:22,800
- So, from my perspective as a fan, it's just interesting to see what kind of art you create for

2731
03:49:22,866 --> 03:49:26,833
any kind of celebrities, athletes, musicians, because the

2732
03:49:26,866 --> 03:49:30,500
the Snoop, the Snoop gifts are all

2733
03:49:30,566 --> 03:49:33,933
just, like, going back to our previous conversation, just beautiful pieces of art

2734
03:49:35,366 --> 03:49:42,366
that, like, encapsulate certain memes, certain aspects of Snoop that everybody

2735
03:49:42,433 --> 03:49:46,033
knows. These cultural icons that he represents. That's

2736
03:49:46,066 --> 03:49:49,800
cool. That's just... and they're, the detail, the incredible

2737
03:49:49,900 --> 03:49:53,600
detail of the art of the individual gifts is just incredible.

2738
03:49:53,666 --> 03:50:01,500
- And each of these gifts is scalable because it's vector-based. It references

2739
03:50:01,533 --> 03:50:08,633
certain points in Snoop's creative biography. And each of them has countless

2740
03:50:08,966 --> 03:50:15,833
different versions. We had to create over 50 distinctive versions of each.

2741
03:50:16,200 --> 03:50:19,833
And then each individual piece is unique because it also has unique

2742
03:50:19,866 --> 03:50:23,633
background, unique icon in the background. It's

2743
03:50:23,666 --> 03:50:26,366
something that we reinvented because we

2744
03:50:27,233 --> 03:50:30,133
didn't like the old school NFTs. First of all, they were

2745
03:50:31,133 --> 03:50:37,066
not relevant socially because, okay, you have an NFT. Where do you demonstrate

2746
03:50:37,133 --> 03:50:40,166
it? In a Telegram, a Telegram gift is

2747
03:50:40,900 --> 03:50:44,233
there next to your name. It's part of your digital identity on

2748
03:50:44,266 --> 03:50:48,233
Telegram. And then you can create collections of gifts and show it off on your

2749
03:50:48,266 --> 03:50:54,733
profile page. But it also... The other thing that we wanted to reinvent is

2750
03:50:55,666 --> 03:50:59,666
the aesthetic part of it. Most NFTs are just ugly

2751
03:51:01,466 --> 03:51:09,066
and they're not based on any sophisticated technology. So, what we did with

2752
03:51:09,133 --> 03:51:15,800
Snoop's gifts, I think represents an example of

2753
03:51:18,600 --> 03:51:25,033
beautiful, aesthetically pleasing, and at the same time very accurate in terms

2754
03:51:25,100 --> 03:51:29,933
of references to this specific artist's biography,

2755
03:51:30,833 --> 03:51:34,466
a mixture between art and technology, which I think is quite

2756
03:51:34,533 --> 03:51:38,200
rare. I'm quite proud of it. I think it's a new trend, a new

2757
03:51:38,233 --> 03:51:42,166
phenomenon. It's only half a year old. So,

2758
03:51:42,233 --> 03:51:47,766
let's see where it goes. We're gonna select our next influencer

2759
03:51:48,933 --> 03:51:51,433
or artist to be part of it.

2760
03:51:51,466 --> 03:51:55,133
- Hey, listen, I'm really proud I got a Snoop gift next to my name

2761
03:51:55,666 --> 03:51:59,533
and I figured out that you can add even more by pinning them. It's like a

2762
03:51:59,600 --> 03:52:01,966
cool little art icon.

2763
03:52:02,033 --> 03:52:05,766
- We didn't expect it, by the way. We just had a lot of fun

2764
03:52:05,833 --> 03:52:09,600
launching these things and then we realized

2765
03:52:09,666 --> 03:52:15,133
that one of the first collections we issued, we sold each piece at something like

2766
03:52:16,766 --> 03:52:25,266
$5. And then the minimum price of any items in these collections currently is

2767
03:52:25,333 --> 03:52:30,233
something like $10,000. And it keeps going up.

2768
03:52:31,133 --> 03:52:36,566
So, I was quite surprised with the reception. I realized, you know, when

2769
03:52:36,700 --> 03:52:40,533
you are trying to monetize a social media platform in a way

2770
03:52:40,600 --> 03:52:48,133
that is consistent with your values, you're forced to find ways that benefit your

2771
03:52:48,233 --> 03:52:55,533
users, not exploit them. People love these gifts. People love the fact that they can

2772
03:52:55,566 --> 03:52:59,400
congratulate a person close to them with something valuable

2773
03:52:59,766 --> 03:53:03,566
and at the same time something beautiful. Also, some people

2774
03:53:03,633 --> 03:53:06,666
make a business out of it, which is funny. They resell these

2775
03:53:06,733 --> 03:53:11,933
gifts. We recently met a guy who earned several million dollars

2776
03:53:14,500 --> 03:53:16,566
just from buying and selling gifts.

2777
03:53:16,566 --> 03:53:17,666
- It's a real market.

2778
03:53:17,700 --> 03:53:20,900
- It's a real market. And it's just something that he did in a few

2779
03:53:20,966 --> 03:53:24,366
months. And last year when we launched

2780
03:53:26,033 --> 03:53:30,100
many new features for the mini apps on Telegram and,

2781
03:53:31,000 --> 03:53:33,866
payments options for them and the other monetization

2782
03:53:33,933 --> 03:53:38,633
options, the same guy earned $12 million

2783
03:53:40,700 --> 03:53:44,100
from mini apps. And I know several people who

2784
03:53:44,133 --> 03:53:47,566
anecdotally, like, "I earned $10 million, I earned $3

2785
03:53:47,633 --> 03:53:51,033
million," just in a matter of months single-handedly.

2786
03:53:51,100 --> 03:53:53,600
Sometimes they would have a team of two, three

2787
03:53:53,666 --> 03:53:58,566
people. So, whenever I hear stories from people who

2788
03:54:00,366 --> 03:54:05,833
were able to build businesses on top of Telegram, this makes me incredibly proud.

2789
03:54:05,866 --> 03:54:09,733
- And mini apps include games, they include tools, services of

2790
03:54:09,766 --> 03:54:13,733
any kind. It's an app within the ecosystem of Telegram. Let

2791
03:54:13,766 --> 03:54:17,266
me ask you about crypto in general. So, you've been an early supporter of,

2792
03:54:17,366 --> 03:54:24,200
cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin. You bought into Bitcoin early on.

2793
03:54:24,233 --> 03:54:28,200
You kept buying. Maybe you could speak

2794
03:54:28,266 --> 03:54:30,466
to the reasoning why you kept buying Bitcoin.

2795
03:54:31,433 --> 03:54:35,133
Do you think Bitcoin will go to a million dollars? Do you think it'll keep increasing?

2796
03:54:36,066 --> 03:54:40,033
And Bitcoin and all the other cryptocurrencies.

2797
03:54:40,066 --> 03:54:43,800
- I was a big believer in Bitcoins since more or less the

2798
03:54:43,866 --> 03:54:49,233
start of it. I got to buy my first few thousand of Bitcoin in

2799
03:54:50,133 --> 03:54:54,000
2013, and I didn't care much. I

2800
03:54:54,033 --> 03:54:57,700
think I bought it at the local maximum. It's something like

2801
03:54:57,700 --> 03:55:01,600
$700 per Bitcoin, and I just threw a

2802
03:55:01,633 --> 03:55:08,700
couple millions there. And a lot of people after Bitcoin, later next year, went

2803
03:55:08,733 --> 03:55:15,066
down, somewhere close to 300, 200, started to express

2804
03:55:16,366 --> 03:55:22,100
their sympathy to me. They say, "Oh, you're a poor fellow. You made

2805
03:55:22,133 --> 03:55:27,366
this horrible mistake investing in this new thing, but don't feel bad about it.

2806
03:55:28,400 --> 03:55:31,900
We still have some respect for you." And I,

2807
03:55:32,300 --> 03:55:34,466
my response to them was, "I don't care. I'm not going to sell

2808
03:55:34,533 --> 03:55:41,300
it." I believe in this thing. I think this is the way money should

2809
03:55:41,366 --> 03:55:48,500
work. Nobody can confiscate your Bitcoin from you. Nobody can

2810
03:55:48,566 --> 03:56:01,066
censor you for political reasons. This is the ultimate means of exchange,

2811
03:56:02,666 --> 03:56:06,266
and again, I'm now talking about Bitcoin but it relates to

2812
03:56:06,900 --> 03:56:12,600
cryptocurrencies in general. So I have been able to fund my

2813
03:56:13,533 --> 03:56:18,066
lifestyle, so to say, from my Bitcoin investment. Some people think

2814
03:56:18,966 --> 03:56:21,766
if I'm able to rent nice locations or

2815
03:56:23,300 --> 03:56:26,633
fly private, it's because I somehow extract money from

2816
03:56:26,700 --> 03:56:33,500
Telegram. But like I said, Telegram is a money-losing operation for me personally.

2817
03:56:35,100 --> 03:56:39,800
Bitcoin is something that allowed me to

2818
03:56:41,466 --> 03:56:48,666
stay afloat, and I believe it will come to a point when Bitcoin is worth $1

2819
03:56:48,700 --> 03:56:52,366
million. Just look at the trends. The

2820
03:56:52,400 --> 03:56:55,900
governments keep printing money like no tomorrow.

2821
03:56:56,700 --> 03:56:58,466
Nobody's printing Bitcoin. There is

2822
03:57:00,133 --> 03:57:06,133
a predictable inflation and then it stops at a certain point.

2823
03:57:07,966 --> 03:57:13,000
Bitcoin is here to stay. All the fiat currencies, remains to be seen.

2824
03:57:13,100 --> 03:57:17,066
- Let me ask you a deeply philosophical, serious question. In your first Tucker interview

2825
03:57:17,133 --> 03:57:21,100
you had two interesting chairs in the background. I think they

2826
03:57:21,166 --> 03:57:28,900
reference a now legendary meme the choice is Пики точеные или хуи дрочёные.

2827
03:57:29,866 --> 03:57:33,433
What is the philosophical wisdom in the dilemma that these two

2828
03:57:33,566 --> 03:57:37,733
chairs present? Have you had to face the dilemma yourself personally?

2829
03:57:37,800 --> 03:57:45,266
- Not this exact dilemma. I think this is a riddle that people have to face in Russian

2830
03:57:45,366 --> 03:57:50,100
prisons. And metaphorically,

2831
03:57:52,066 --> 03:57:57,233
it's describing all the situations where you're presented a choice

2832
03:57:58,400 --> 03:58:02,366
between two suboptimal options. When you're running

2833
03:58:02,500 --> 03:58:06,100
a big business or when you're running a large country, it is

2834
03:58:06,133 --> 03:58:09,833
similar. You sometimes face this dilemma. What are you going to do?

2835
03:58:11,100 --> 03:58:14,400
This very horrible thing or this also very horrible

2836
03:58:14,466 --> 03:58:19,100
thing? So I think the right answer to this riddle is

2837
03:58:20,600 --> 03:58:27,133
not to do any of these things. Reframe the question.

2838
03:58:28,866 --> 03:58:38,500
Design a solution that turns a disadvantage into an advantage, and then use it

2839
03:58:39,700 --> 03:58:41,933
to cope with the other side of the problem.

2840
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:44,966
So, do you know the answer to that riddle?

2841
03:58:45,000 --> 03:58:51,500
- No, somebody on the internet said: "Не ходи туда, где задают такие вопросы." Which is

2842
03:58:51,566 --> 03:58:58,666
basically, "Try to avoid the situations where such

2843
03:58:58,700 --> 03:59:02,366
dilemmas present themselves, where there's no right answer."

2844
03:59:02,466 --> 03:59:05,700
- This is one of the ways to answer this question.

2845
03:59:05,800 --> 03:59:11,533
If you got to a tricky situation, that probably earlier you made a certain mistake.

2846
03:59:11,566 --> 03:59:12,633
- You fucked up already.

2847
03:59:12,633 --> 03:59:16,466
- It should have been avoided. But the other quite creative answer to this

2848
03:59:16,533 --> 03:59:19,366
question is that you

2849
03:59:22,733 --> 03:59:28,066
is you take the sharp objects from one of the chairs, or the spikes,

2850
03:59:29,200 --> 03:59:32,066
and then you use them to cut off

2851
03:59:33,033 --> 03:59:37,900
the objects from the other chair, and you know what objects I'm talking about.

2852
03:59:37,900 --> 03:59:41,100
- That's a very engineering solution. I'm glad somebody came up with that.

2853
03:59:41,133 --> 03:59:46,866
- I believe this is the right answer. We're often being manipulated

2854
03:59:48,633 --> 03:59:57,733
by politicians, by corporate leaders, to make a choice from two suboptimal options,

2855
03:59:57,766 --> 04:00:01,633
and then when we are forced to make the choice, and we make the choice, it's

2856
04:00:01,733 --> 04:00:06,333
almost as if it's something that we have to assume responsibility

2857
04:00:06,400 --> 04:00:11,466
for. I don't think we should be buying into that.

2858
04:00:12,400 --> 04:00:16,066
- Okay, on this theme of absurdity and ridiculousness, let

2859
04:00:16,100 --> 04:00:23,633
me... there's an object here that appeared in the... Not many people seem to have

2860
04:00:23,733 --> 04:00:27,433
noticed this. People should go watch your excellent conversation in

2861
04:00:27,466 --> 04:00:34,500
the Oslo Freedom Forum behind you. I'm no archeologist, but I believe this is

2862
04:00:34,600 --> 04:00:39,033
a... well, how should I put it? A

2863
04:00:40,600 --> 04:00:48,533
walrus penis bone, and it was behind you. You told me that you,

2864
04:00:48,633 --> 04:00:52,133
that you brought it with you to France and back to

2865
04:00:52,133 --> 04:00:59,233
Dubai. I assume it brings you luck of some sort. What's the... why did you bring

2866
04:00:59,300 --> 04:01:02,666
it with you everywhere? Is it kind of like, you know, in America they have a

2867
04:01:02,700 --> 04:01:06,633
wishbone? Is it just a large wishbone?

2868
04:01:06,666 --> 04:01:10,600
Because a wishbone brings you luck. And I should also point out that

2869
04:01:10,666 --> 04:01:13,366
just like with Telegram, with the art, there's tiny little

2870
04:01:13,433 --> 04:01:17,200
walruses. And thanks to you, I had to also find out that a lot of

2871
04:01:17,266 --> 04:01:21,233
mammals have a bone inside their penis, and the evolutionary

2872
04:01:21,300 --> 04:01:25,233
advantage, I guess, of having a bone is quite obvious. It actually raises

2873
04:01:25,266 --> 04:01:28,766
the question of why humans don't have an actual bone inside their

2874
04:01:28,800 --> 04:01:31,666
penis. A lot of questions there.

2875
04:01:31,700 --> 04:01:39,966
- That's a very interesting subject. The reason I have this is because a tribe that is

2876
04:01:40,966 --> 04:01:44,933
almost gone, extinct in Siberia and Mongolia, called

2877
04:01:44,966 --> 04:01:48,866
Evenki, passed me this gift from them.

2878
04:01:48,900 --> 04:01:52,700
Normally, they would craft something like this only for

2879
04:01:52,733 --> 04:02:00,366
their most respected leaders. It is supposed to be a token of their appreciation

2880
04:02:00,433 --> 04:02:07,933
for bravery, courage, leadership. Ironically, it also translates

2881
04:02:09,733 --> 04:02:16,966
in a very specific way into the Russian language. In Russian, "walrus's penis" means

2882
04:02:17,100 --> 04:02:24,900
something a bit funny, which is often used to describe nothing. So, for

2883
04:02:24,933 --> 04:02:30,533
example, if you've been requested by, say, a certain government

2884
04:02:32,100 --> 04:02:33,700
or a certain business partner

2885
04:02:35,766 --> 04:02:41,100
to provide something that you are not willing to provide, you can just politely

2886
04:02:41,966 --> 04:02:47,433
have this penis bone in the background while you're doing the video call

2887
04:02:50,000 --> 04:02:52,166
and hope that they would-

2888
04:02:52,200 --> 04:02:58,866
- through osmosis, figure out the deep message. It is an indirect rebellion.

2889
04:03:00,400 --> 04:03:04,366
By the way, in the former Soviet Union, there was, and a

2890
04:03:04,400 --> 04:03:08,333
lot of places throughout history, some of the rebellion had to take this kind of

2891
04:03:08,400 --> 04:03:12,233
symbolic, metaphoric form, through poetry, through children's

2892
04:03:12,300 --> 04:03:15,600
stories. It's the beauty of

2893
04:03:16,133 --> 04:03:20,033
human language and art that we're able to do that. Say "eff"

2894
04:03:20,133 --> 04:03:24,133
you to whatever forces that try to overpower us. We say "eff"

2895
04:03:24,200 --> 04:03:28,100
you through poetry, through art, and sometimes through a rather

2896
04:03:28,266 --> 04:03:34,300
large walrus penis bone... carried by what appears to be

2897
04:03:35,233 --> 04:03:38,900
either a happy sumo wrestler or a cat of some sort.

2898
04:03:38,933 --> 04:03:43,633
- They asked a lot of questions about this walrus's penis bone

2899
04:03:44,600 --> 04:03:50,533
in the airport, both here in the UAE and in France. They are always very

2900
04:03:50,566 --> 04:03:51,900
interested in this thing.

2901
04:03:51,933 --> 04:03:57,566
- Hmm. There seems to be some confusion over how many kids you have.

2902
04:03:59,200 --> 04:04:05,933
It's often said to be over 100. Can you explain how many kids you have?

2903
04:04:06,000 --> 04:04:08,833
- The truthful answer to this question is I don't really

2904
04:04:08,933 --> 04:04:11,900
know how many biological kids I have

2905
04:04:11,933 --> 04:04:19,000
exactly, because at a certain point in my life, about 15 years ago, I decided that

2906
04:04:22,533 --> 04:04:26,100
it was a good idea to be a sperm donor.

2907
04:04:26,100 --> 04:04:28,500
Initially, a friend of mine asked me to help,

2908
04:04:29,700 --> 04:04:33,200
because they were trying to have a baby with his wife, and

2909
04:04:36,100 --> 04:04:39,866
they experienced certain health issues that prevented them to do it the

2910
04:04:39,866 --> 04:04:43,833
natural way. And he asked me, he told me, "We don't want to

2911
04:04:43,933 --> 04:04:51,500
just rely on some random, anonymous genetic material. We want somebody we know

2912
04:04:52,600 --> 04:04:58,133
and respect to be the biological father of our kid." And I said,

2913
04:04:59,266 --> 04:05:03,100
"You gotta be kidding me. Sounds ridiculous. What are you even

2914
04:05:03,100 --> 04:05:06,866
talking about?" But then I realized it's, it's

2915
04:05:06,933 --> 04:05:10,933
actually a serious issue, and they were not the only couple struggling with

2916
04:05:10,966 --> 04:05:14,666
that. So eventually, I got persuaded into doing more of

2917
04:05:14,700 --> 04:05:18,700
it. I can't say I'm incredibly proud of that, but I think it was

2918
04:05:18,733 --> 04:05:22,700
the right thing to do, particularly at the time when I thought, "Okay, I probably don't have much

2919
04:05:22,733 --> 04:05:26,500
time on this planet left.

2920
04:05:27,700 --> 04:05:33,200
Things are getting trickier and trickier, so if I can help some couples

2921
04:05:34,233 --> 04:05:41,166
have babies, let's do it." And then more recently, when I was working on my will,

2922
04:05:42,333 --> 04:05:47,933
I realized that I shouldn't make a distinction between the kids

2923
04:05:48,366 --> 04:05:54,333
conceived naturally and the kids who are just my biological kids that I never

2924
04:05:54,400 --> 04:05:59,066
seen. As long as they can establish their

2925
04:06:03,166 --> 04:06:09,433
shared DNA with me, someday, maybe in 30 years from

2926
04:06:09,500 --> 04:06:16,200
now, they have to be entitled to a share

2927
04:06:17,000 --> 04:06:23,700
of my estate after I'm gone. And that made a lot of noise in the news for some

2928
04:06:23,733 --> 04:06:26,666
reason. People get very excited by this kind of

2929
04:06:26,700 --> 04:06:31,433
news. I got a lot of messages from people claiming they're my kids.

2930
04:06:32,533 --> 04:06:36,066
I got a lot of requests from people asking me to adopt them.

2931
04:06:37,533 --> 04:06:41,266
The memes were priceless, but understanding

2932
04:06:41,300 --> 04:06:45,233
that... no, it's not a thing that most people do.

2933
04:06:45,300 --> 04:06:49,633
I don't see anything wrong with it. If anything, I think more people should

2934
04:06:51,033 --> 04:06:52,333
be donating sperm.

2935
04:06:52,700 --> 04:06:56,500
- So, yeah, we should say that the 100-plus kids is from

2936
04:06:56,600 --> 04:07:02,633
that, and you also have naturally conceived kids. And it was a pretty bold decision

2937
04:07:03,066 --> 04:07:10,300
to, from a financial perspective, to treat them all equally. And

2938
04:07:10,400 --> 04:07:18,000
also quite interesting was that you kind of said that they don't receive any money

2939
04:07:19,066 --> 04:07:24,466
for the first few decades of their life. Can you describe that thinking?

2940
04:07:24,500 --> 04:07:30,733
- Yeah, I think overabundance paralyzes motivation and

2941
04:07:30,800 --> 04:07:34,600
willpower. It's extremely harmful,

2942
04:07:34,600 --> 04:07:38,400
particularly for young boys, to grow up in an environment

2943
04:07:38,500 --> 04:07:44,200
where they can be proud, not of their own achievements, but of

2944
04:07:45,466 --> 04:07:55,366
their father's achievements or their father's wealth. This removes the incentive to

2945
04:07:57,966 --> 04:08:04,900
work on developing their own skills, removes the incentive to study, to

2946
04:08:05,000 --> 04:08:10,000
work. So, I thought if they're going to have this

2947
04:08:12,400 --> 04:08:19,033
money, it should be something that they would only get

2948
04:08:19,966 --> 04:08:27,666
when they're already adult. It's still risky. But one of the reasons I

2949
04:08:27,666 --> 04:08:36,000
decided it makes more sense to divide this huge wealth that

2950
04:08:37,533 --> 04:08:41,066
I'm likely to leave behind among

2951
04:08:42,533 --> 04:08:47,800
100 or more than 100 people, is that it won't be too much

2952
04:08:49,400 --> 04:08:55,833
for every single descendant. But at the same

2953
04:08:55,900 --> 04:09:00,233
time, some people did the calculation. It's still

2954
04:09:02,200 --> 04:09:11,566
many, many millions of dollars for each child, so I'm not sure it helps too much.

2955
04:09:11,700 --> 04:09:15,200
- On the topic of abundance, offline, we had a lot of

2956
04:09:15,200 --> 04:09:18,833
fascinating philosophical discussions, one of which was about the mouse

2957
04:09:18,966 --> 04:09:25,666
paradise experiment, also known as Universe 25. It's an experiment from

2958
04:09:26,300 --> 04:09:33,566
the 1960s and early 70s, conducted by ethologist John B. Calhoun.

2959
04:09:33,633 --> 04:09:36,933
And we can talk about this one for hours also, I'm

2960
04:09:37,000 --> 04:09:43,700
sure. But it was an experiment with a few hundreds of individual mice compartments,

2961
04:09:44,733 --> 04:09:48,600
and they provided them with unlimited food, water, nesting,

2962
04:09:48,666 --> 04:09:51,766
no predators, stable temperatures, and frequent cleaning.

2963
04:09:51,800 --> 04:09:55,200
Basically, the definition of abundance as far as mice

2964
04:09:55,300 --> 04:09:58,933
go. And the interesting aspect of this experiment

2965
04:09:59,166 --> 04:10:02,600
is that at first the population doubled, it grew very

2966
04:10:02,666 --> 04:10:10,200
quickly, but then it leveled off, and certain really negative social things started

2967
04:10:10,366 --> 04:10:14,266
happening. Like mothers neglected or killed their young. Violent attacks and

2968
04:10:14,300 --> 04:10:16,233
hypersexual activity became widespread.

2969
04:10:17,100 --> 04:10:20,866
Some "beautiful" ones, largely inactive, well-groomed mice

2970
04:10:20,966 --> 04:10:24,400
withdrew, refusing to mate or interact. So, all of these kind of

2971
04:10:24,466 --> 04:10:27,966
societal qualities that we see as negative for the functioning of a

2972
04:10:28,000 --> 04:10:33,966
society started to emerge because of the abundance, and finally the

2973
04:10:34,033 --> 04:10:37,700
collapse. The reproduction rates crashed. Social

2974
04:10:37,733 --> 04:10:41,400
dysfunction spread to the next generation and eventually just went

2975
04:10:41,466 --> 04:10:45,333
extinct. It didn't just plummet to a low level,

2976
04:10:45,366 --> 04:10:49,333
it plummeted steadily to zero despite the fact that there

2977
04:10:49,400 --> 04:10:52,300
was ongoing resource abundance. As

2978
04:10:52,400 --> 04:10:58,833
the description states, "The last mice died surrounded by untouched food and

2979
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:02,900
water." So, I mean, there's deep wisdom to that

2980
04:11:02,966 --> 04:11:06,366
about abundance. It seems... You've mentioned this in different

2981
04:11:06,400 --> 04:11:10,066
contexts throughout this conversation, is it seems

2982
04:11:10,133 --> 04:11:16,833
like scarcity, it seems like constraints, it seems like non-abundance

2983
04:11:18,066 --> 04:11:22,200
is essential for human flourishing, which is a counterintuitive notion.

2984
04:11:23,166 --> 04:11:26,100
It's true for mice, and I think it's probably true for humans too.

2985
04:11:27,266 --> 04:11:33,200
- We have evolved to overcome scarcity. Almost by definition there

2986
04:11:33,200 --> 04:11:37,800
has never been such thing as infinite amount of food

2987
04:11:38,966 --> 04:11:49,200
or entertainment in our lives before now. We seem as a species to lose our ability

2988
04:11:50,566 --> 04:11:57,800
to identify purpose in a world where you have everything, and everything loses its

2989
04:11:57,866 --> 04:12:04,733
meaning. Restrictions are important. I think, though, that they should be

2990
04:12:04,800 --> 04:12:09,366
coming from within. It should be self-restriction rather than restriction

2991
04:12:10,633 --> 04:12:16,500
in order to create purpose and meaning in life. In a way, I was lucky in a very

2992
04:12:17,833 --> 04:12:21,233
counterintuitive way because I grew up

2993
04:12:21,266 --> 04:12:28,566
poor. I didn't have money when I was a teenager. I had the same jacket for years,

2994
04:12:30,500 --> 04:12:36,900
which was bought on a second-hand marketplace. My father wouldn't receive

2995
04:12:38,066 --> 04:12:41,866
his salary as a university professor for months because

2996
04:12:43,200 --> 04:12:49,066
the Russian state was almost bankrupt back then. My mom had to

2997
04:12:50,600 --> 04:12:54,800
juggle two jobs to take care of us. It was

2998
04:12:55,800 --> 04:13:02,266
not easy, but it also created purpose, it created meaning, it created

2999
04:13:02,366 --> 04:13:09,266
priorities. It allowed us to focus on things that mattered, allowed us

3000
04:13:09,366 --> 04:13:20,866
to develop our character and intellectual abilities. Now, if we had everything...

3001
04:13:22,133 --> 04:13:26,266
why do anything? These mice...

3002
04:13:30,666 --> 04:13:36,133
suffered societal collapse that was irreversible. And this

3003
04:13:37,400 --> 04:13:44,666
is not an accident. This kind of experiment has been repeated countless times. At a

3004
04:13:44,700 --> 04:13:52,233
certain point, social dysfunction and the erosion of social roles becomes

3005
04:13:52,300 --> 04:13:59,333
contagious, and the society gradually degrades into a

3006
04:13:59,400 --> 04:14:03,466
chaotic collection of individuals

3007
04:14:04,500 --> 04:14:09,866
unable to take care of the next generation or even to produce the next generation,

3008
04:14:11,800 --> 04:14:13,966
and it goes extinct.

3009
04:14:14,000 --> 04:14:17,300
- It's fascinating because we're creating technologies, and this is what AI

3010
04:14:17,400 --> 04:14:23,600
is proposing to our future generations as a problem to solve, which

3011
04:14:23,666 --> 04:14:27,600
is AI may very well create abundance. And so

3012
04:14:27,633 --> 04:14:31,566
we will be like these mice potentially, whether it's AI or

3013
04:14:31,666 --> 04:14:35,033
other kinds of technologies that increase and give more and

3014
04:14:35,066 --> 04:14:38,966
more to all of us, and it is a thing that will decrease the amount of

3015
04:14:39,000 --> 04:14:42,666
suffering in the world, increase the quality of life. But as we reach towards that

3016
04:14:42,733 --> 04:14:45,900
abundance, the fabric that connects us,

3017
04:14:46,866 --> 04:14:49,666
rooted in our biology that's developed by evolution

3018
04:14:50,966 --> 04:14:53,266
might create a real challenge for us.

3019
04:14:54,233 --> 04:14:57,000
- We should find the right balance between chaos and order,

3020
04:14:58,133 --> 04:15:02,033
between self-restriction and freedom for creativity.

3021
04:15:03,200 --> 04:15:06,833
- Your father recently celebrated his 80th birthday. You had a

3022
04:15:06,900 --> 04:15:09,666
conversation with him. He gave you some life

3023
04:15:09,700 --> 04:15:15,500
advice. I think you mentioned to me one of the things he said was not to just

3024
04:15:17,433 --> 04:15:20,800
speak of your principles, but to live them, to lead by

3025
04:15:20,866 --> 04:15:24,566
example. I think this is something you already

3026
04:15:24,700 --> 04:15:30,200
do well. Maybe can you speak to what you've learned about life from your father,

3027
04:15:32,333 --> 04:15:36,733
maybe some of the lessons he told you in the conversation you had with him

3028
04:15:37,933 --> 04:15:38,666
on his birthday?

3029
04:15:40,966 --> 04:15:47,533
- I'm incredibly lucky to have my father.

3030
04:15:48,366 --> 04:15:55,866
He's a person who wrote countless books on ancient Rome and ancient Roman

3031
04:15:55,900 --> 04:15:59,700
literature, dozens of

3032
04:16:00,766 --> 04:16:06,200
scientific papers, and I always remember him working. He would be

3033
04:16:06,466 --> 04:16:11,666
busy typing his books and articles on an old-school

3034
04:16:11,800 --> 04:16:16,300
typewriter back in the late '80s, early '90s.

3035
04:16:18,166 --> 04:16:24,033
He was relentless. The example he set to myself and my brother was

3036
04:16:24,066 --> 04:16:30,066
priceless. Some people make this mistake of thinking that

3037
04:16:32,100 --> 04:16:34,466
you can instill the right principles

3038
04:16:36,866 --> 04:16:40,300
in the future generation or into your kids by saying things to

3039
04:16:40,333 --> 04:16:47,533
them, but kids are smart. They discount words; they look at the actions.

3040
04:16:48,066 --> 04:16:54,133
So observing our father was a big lesson by itself.

3041
04:16:55,900 --> 04:16:58,266
It wasn't necessary for him to say anything to us.

3042
04:16:59,266 --> 04:17:03,900
And then at the same time, he was incredibly patient, emotionally

3043
04:17:04,000 --> 04:17:11,566
resilient. And, you know, my mom, great woman, incredibly smart, highly

3044
04:17:11,666 --> 04:17:21,900
educated, but she would sometimes try to test the patience of my father, and it's a

3045
04:17:23,800 --> 04:17:27,733
trait rooted in our biology. There's

3046
04:17:27,766 --> 04:17:34,200
an evolutionary explanation for that, that women sometimes tend to do that. And he

3047
04:17:34,333 --> 04:17:42,133
demonstrated incredible patience all the time. He told me recently, "You shouldn't

3048
04:17:42,966 --> 04:17:45,233
give the wrong example

3049
04:17:46,066 --> 04:17:49,966
to the people around you, and in particular, to your kids, because

3050
04:17:50,066 --> 04:17:53,300
you can do the right thing nine times out of

3051
04:17:53,333 --> 04:17:57,000
ten, but you make a mistake once, and they will

3052
04:17:57,066 --> 04:18:00,366
instantly copy it. If you're telling your kids not to use a

3053
04:18:00,433 --> 04:18:03,333
smartphone, but you're using a smartphone all the time yourself

3054
04:18:05,100 --> 04:18:09,066
and coming up with all kinds of sophisticated, brilliant explanations

3055
04:18:09,200 --> 04:18:15,633
why they shouldn't be using a smartphone, it won't land. It's bound to fail."

3056
04:18:17,000 --> 04:18:20,833
So you lead by example. And there are other numerous

3057
04:18:20,900 --> 04:18:25,266
lessons: staying positive, looking at the bright side,

3058
04:18:26,400 --> 04:18:34,100
never despair, be honest. And, you know, he told me last time I spoke to him that AI

3059
04:18:34,900 --> 04:18:40,233
can have consciousness, can be creative, but it cannot have

3060
04:18:40,966 --> 04:18:46,566
conscience. In a way, it cannot be moral. It cannot have

3061
04:18:47,733 --> 04:18:51,200
deeply rooted principles, cannot have integrity

3062
04:18:52,366 --> 04:18:56,633
in the meaning that we understand it as human beings.

3063
04:18:57,533 --> 04:19:01,500
- I love the fact that you're talking to your 80-year-old father and

3064
04:19:01,600 --> 04:19:09,866
you're talking about AGI. And the difference between human, the human

3065
04:19:09,966 --> 04:19:13,633
spirit, human nature and what AGI, AI is able to

3066
04:19:13,700 --> 04:19:16,800
achieve, and conscience is the thing that

3067
04:19:18,666 --> 04:19:23,566
humans have. The ability to know the right from wrong.

3068
04:19:23,666 --> 04:19:27,366
- This is the lesson that he gave me.

3069
04:19:29,200 --> 04:19:32,933
One of my goals in life is never to disappoint him.

3070
04:19:33,800 --> 04:19:37,733
- Another thing we've talked about, which I think is a

3071
04:19:38,300 --> 04:19:43,900
fascinating topic, is the power of the mind, power of thought.

3072
04:19:44,966 --> 04:19:48,800
Do you believe you can affect your life in reality

3073
04:19:48,833 --> 04:19:55,933
by thinking about it, by manifesting it into being? What do you think?

3074
04:19:55,966 --> 04:19:59,600
- There are many explanations why it works. One

3075
04:19:59,633 --> 04:20:05,800
thing most people agree on is that setting goals and staying positive and confident

3076
04:20:07,133 --> 04:20:12,666
does allow you to achieve the things you want to achieve.

3077
04:20:13,900 --> 04:20:17,266
It's very hard to believe, though, that you can just

3078
04:20:17,500 --> 04:20:23,166
manifest things into being without applying effort

3079
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:32,600
in the direction that seems to be logical. Maybe some people exist

3080
04:20:33,400 --> 04:20:35,466
that can just sit on the bank of a river

3081
04:20:36,733 --> 04:20:44,066
and materialize things by the power of their thought, but I'm not sure I'm one of

3082
04:20:44,100 --> 04:20:51,833
these people. I always found it more easy to believe that if you couple this

3083
04:20:51,900 --> 04:21:04,733
optimism and faith with logical action, then it is bound to be successful.

3084
04:21:04,766 --> 04:21:12,966
- Prolonged effort, hard work coupled with positive focus, thinking about the thing.

3085
04:21:13,066 --> 04:21:17,033
- Oh, yes, over many, many, many days. It is possible

3086
04:21:17,166 --> 04:21:21,533
to imagine our world as a high dimensional universe

3087
04:21:22,400 --> 04:21:29,100
where humans have the ability to navigate through it with the power of

3088
04:21:29,900 --> 04:21:34,000
belief, which is coupled with

3089
04:21:36,666 --> 04:21:43,566
positive emotion and logical thinking. But we are getting into

3090
04:21:43,600 --> 04:21:47,633
an esoteric realm. We don't have any proof of that,

3091
04:21:49,300 --> 04:21:55,466
but we also know that we probably, at this point, haven't discovered even 1%

3092
04:21:58,000 --> 04:22:00,600
about this universe.

3093
04:22:00,666 --> 04:22:04,566
- I agree with you fully, and I like what you said in the way you

3094
04:22:04,600 --> 04:22:08,033
were thinking about it. You've told me

3095
04:22:08,066 --> 04:22:12,033
before that maybe there's a way that with effort and with

3096
04:22:12,033 --> 04:22:16,000
a focused mind, you can shape, you can morph the

3097
04:22:16,066 --> 04:22:19,433
sort of landscape of probabilities around

3098
04:22:19,500 --> 04:22:23,766
you, and it's a nice way to visualize it, that somehow our effort

3099
04:22:24,666 --> 04:22:34,266
and our focus changes the things that are likely and less likely, and

3100
04:22:34,300 --> 04:22:38,100
by focusing on it, we make the thing more and more likely. At least as an

3101
04:22:38,200 --> 04:22:42,900
estimate, as a kind of field that we through our thoughts and through our actions

3102
04:22:43,866 --> 04:22:49,766
change that field, and there's eight billion of us doing so. And

3103
04:22:49,833 --> 04:22:53,333
together there's this collective intelligence that creates the world we see around

3104
04:22:53,400 --> 04:23:01,966
us, like the mice. And like you said, us as a humanity together are

3105
04:23:02,033 --> 04:23:04,700
perfect. I like that you said that.

3106
04:23:05,800 --> 04:23:10,200
- I admire your belief in the fact that we get to experience

3107
04:23:12,000 --> 04:23:15,033
this together, because it's not obvious.

3108
04:23:15,833 --> 04:23:20,200
Maybe each of us experiences his own or her own universe,

3109
04:23:21,266 --> 04:23:25,033
and maybe every second the universe splits into a billion of different

3110
04:23:25,066 --> 04:23:30,933
universes, and everything that can happen, happens. And there is a universe where,

3111
04:23:33,166 --> 04:23:40,833
say I died in 2013, maybe every time I die I actually get to shift to a parallel

3112
04:23:40,900 --> 04:23:46,433
universe where I don't die and then it keeps going and at certain points

3113
04:23:47,666 --> 04:23:52,533
we achieve this quantum immortality when we are 1,000 years old,

3114
04:23:54,100 --> 04:24:04,600
but a lot of people from other versions of reality think we are long gone.

3115
04:24:04,666 --> 04:24:08,566
- Yeah, this is something that you explained to me, the idea of quantum immortality, which is a thought

3116
04:24:08,633 --> 04:24:11,800
experiment, which I find deeply fascinating. People should look into it.

3117
04:24:11,833 --> 04:24:15,333
it. Which is very crisp, clean

3118
04:24:15,466 --> 04:24:18,800
consequence of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics,

3119
04:24:19,566 --> 04:24:23,533
that we as conscious beings can't experience our death. We can

3120
04:24:23,566 --> 04:24:31,300
only... As we branch into these many worlds, only the living

3121
04:24:32,000 --> 04:24:35,733
consciousnesses get to experience it. So in some sense,

3122
04:24:35,800 --> 04:24:39,600
yeah, there's many universes. If we're to

3123
04:24:39,633 --> 04:24:43,600
seriously take the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, there's many universes where you

3124
04:24:43,633 --> 04:24:47,500
died many times, especially you. And I'm glad we're in a universe where we get to share the table

3125
04:24:47,533 --> 04:24:50,600
we're the, in a universe where we get to share the table

3126
04:24:51,866 --> 04:24:54,900
with this impressive bond, a little humor and a lot of

3127
04:24:55,000 --> 04:25:02,066
serious topics covered today. Once again, I can't say enough, a giant thank you from

3128
04:25:02,100 --> 04:25:05,966
me and a giant thank you from hundreds of millions of people that follow your

3129
04:25:06,066 --> 04:25:13,866
work for you fighting for the freedom of all of us to speak and creating a

3130
04:25:13,866 --> 04:25:17,700
platform where we can do so. And thank you so much for talking

3131
04:25:17,700 --> 04:25:21,600
today, brother. It's been an honor getting to know you and to be able

3132
04:25:21,666 --> 04:25:22,833
to call you a friend.

3133
04:25:22,900 --> 04:25:27,566
- Thank you for saying that. I'm also incredibly grateful

3134
04:25:29,200 --> 04:25:32,833
to you and to the fact that I happen to be in this version of reality.

3135
04:25:33,800 --> 04:25:38,266
When I haven't died, at least yet. And hopefully

3136
04:25:39,933 --> 04:25:44,000
we'll get to spend more fun moments in the years to come together.

3137
04:25:44,000 --> 04:25:44,666
- Thank you, brother.

3138
04:25:45,666 --> 04:25:47,266
Thank you for listening to this conversation

3139
04:25:47,266 --> 04:25:48,700
with Pavel Durov.

3140
04:25:48,700 --> 04:25:49,800

And now, let me try

3143
04:25:53,566 --> 04:25:56,000
to articulate some things I've been thinking about.

3144
04:25:56,000 --> 04:25:59,600
If you would like to submit questions or topics like this

3145
04:25:59,600 --> 04:26:01,400
for me to talk about in the future,

3146
04:26:01,400 --> 04:26:04,500
go to lexfridman.com/ama.

3147
04:26:05,666 --> 04:26:08,900
I'd like to use this opportunity to talk about Franz Kafka,

3148
04:26:08,900 --> 04:26:10,333
one of my favorite writers.

3149
04:26:11,166 --> 04:26:12,833
The reason he has been on my mind

3150
04:26:12,833 --> 04:26:15,000
is that his work, "The Trial,"

3151
04:26:15,000 --> 04:26:17,466
and the case of Pavel Duro in France

3152
04:26:17,466 --> 04:26:20,366
has, let's say, eerie parallels,

3153
04:26:20,366 --> 04:26:23,300
both metaphorically and literally.

3154
04:26:23,300 --> 04:26:25,666
Of course, "The Trial" is a work of fiction,

3155
04:26:25,666 --> 04:26:27,133
but I think it is often useful

3156
04:26:27,133 --> 04:26:29,700
to go to the surreal world of literature,

3157
04:26:29,700 --> 04:26:32,566
even of the over-the-top dystopian variety

3158
04:26:32,566 --> 04:26:35,233
like "1984," "Animal Farm,"

3159
04:26:35,233 --> 04:26:37,133
"Brave New World," "The Trial,"

3160
04:26:37,133 --> 04:26:39,000
"The Castle," "Metamorphosis,"

3161
04:26:39,000 --> 04:26:42,033
even "The Plague" by Albert Camus,

3162
04:26:42,033 --> 04:26:44,800
all to better understand our real world

3163
04:26:44,800 --> 04:26:46,433
and the destructive paths

3164
04:26:46,433 --> 04:26:49,400
we have the potential to go down together,

3165
04:26:49,400 --> 04:26:52,666
which also hopefully helps us understand

3166
04:26:52,666 --> 04:26:54,366
how to avoid doing so.

3167
04:26:55,400 --> 04:26:58,233
So lemme zoom out and speak about Franz Kafka.

3168
04:26:58,233 --> 04:26:59,500
Who was he?

3169
04:26:59,500 --> 04:27:02,966
He was an insurance clerk who wrote at night.

3170
04:27:02,966 --> 04:27:05,600
He died young and almost completely unknown,

3171
04:27:05,600 --> 04:27:09,633
and he asked for his manuscripts to be burned.

3172
04:27:09,633 --> 04:27:12,566
Luckily for us, his friend, Max Brod,

3173
04:27:12,566 --> 04:27:14,033
refused to do so,

3174
04:27:14,033 --> 04:27:16,500
giving us the work of what I consider

3175
04:27:16,500 --> 04:27:19,233
to be one of 20th century's greatest writers.

3176
04:27:20,200 --> 04:27:21,800
In his work, Kafka wrote

3177
04:27:21,800 --> 04:27:24,033
about the cold, machine-like reduction

3178
04:27:24,033 --> 04:27:25,766
of humanistic case files

3179
04:27:25,766 --> 04:27:28,500
through the labyrinth of institutional power.

3180
04:27:28,500 --> 04:27:32,266
He wrote about an individual's feeling of guilt

3181
04:27:32,266 --> 04:27:35,066
even when a crime has not been committed.

3182
04:27:35,066 --> 04:27:36,300
Or more generally,

3183
04:27:36,300 --> 04:27:38,100
he wrote about the feeling of anxiety

3184
04:27:38,100 --> 04:27:39,966
that is part of the human condition

3185
04:27:39,966 --> 04:27:42,500
in our modern, chaotic world.

3186
04:27:42,500 --> 04:27:46,233
His writing style was to use short, declarative sentences

3187
04:27:46,233 --> 04:27:48,633
to describe the surreal and the absurd,

3188
04:27:48,633 --> 04:27:51,100
and in so doing, effectively, I think,

3189
04:27:51,100 --> 04:27:53,200
convey the feeling of an experience

3190
04:27:53,200 --> 04:27:56,866
versus simply describing the experience.

3191
04:27:56,866 --> 04:27:58,566
For example, famously,

3192
04:27:58,566 --> 04:28:00,266
his work, "The Metamorphosis"

3193
04:28:00,266 --> 04:28:02,066
opens with the following lines,

3194
04:28:03,200 --> 04:28:06,966
"As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams,

3195
04:28:06,966 --> 04:28:09,566
he found himself transformed in his bed

3196
04:28:09,566 --> 04:28:11,366
into a gigantic insect.

3197
04:28:12,433 --> 04:28:15,100
He was lying in his hard, armor-plated back,

3198
04:28:15,100 --> 04:28:17,233
and when he lifted his head a little,

3199
04:28:17,233 --> 04:28:19,366
he could see his dome-like brown belly

3200
04:28:19,366 --> 04:28:22,733
divided into stiff arched segments,

3201
04:28:22,733 --> 04:28:26,700
on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position

3202
04:28:26,700 --> 04:28:29,566
and was about to slide off completely.

3203
04:28:29,566 --> 04:28:31,066
His numerous legs,

3204
04:28:31,066 --> 04:28:33,100
which were pitifully thin

3205
04:28:33,100 --> 04:28:34,866
compared to the rest of his bulk,

3206
04:28:34,866 --> 04:28:37,366
waved helplessly before his eyes."

3207
04:28:38,566 --> 04:28:41,866
Kafka, I think, effectively uses this image

3208
04:28:41,866 --> 04:28:45,466
of being transformed into a giant bug stuck on his back

3209
04:28:45,466 --> 04:28:47,733
to convey a feeling of helplessness

3210
04:28:47,733 --> 04:28:50,666
and uselessness to his family,

3211
04:28:50,666 --> 04:28:53,666
to his job, to society.

3212
04:28:53,666 --> 04:28:56,000
The feeling of being a burden to everyone,

3213
04:28:56,000 --> 04:28:59,866
dehumanized, alienated, and abandoned,

3214
04:28:59,866 --> 04:29:02,633
the feeling of being only temporarily valued

3215
04:29:02,633 --> 04:29:04,966
as long as he served some function

3216
04:29:04,966 --> 04:29:07,966
for his job or for his family,

3217
04:29:07,966 --> 04:29:09,833
and quickly discarded otherwise.

3218
04:29:10,966 --> 04:29:13,600
I will probably talk about this work in more depth

3219
04:29:13,600 --> 04:29:14,900
at another time,

3220
04:29:14,900 --> 04:29:16,666
because it is so haunting

3221
04:29:16,666 --> 04:29:19,600
and I think it is such a profound description

3222
04:29:19,600 --> 04:29:22,433
of the burden of existence in modern society

3223
04:29:22,433 --> 04:29:23,433
for many people.

3224
04:29:24,333 --> 04:29:27,966
But here, lemme talk about another of his work, "The Trial."

3225
04:29:28,966 --> 04:29:31,800
In this novel, the main character, Josef K,

3226
04:29:31,800 --> 04:29:33,900
is a successful bank officer,

3227
04:29:33,900 --> 04:29:38,700
and he's arrested on his birthday for an unspecified crime

3228
04:29:38,700 --> 04:29:41,866
by a kind of amorphous court

3229
04:29:41,866 --> 04:29:44,566
whose authority is everywhere and nowhere.

3230
04:29:44,566 --> 04:29:46,966
He navigates a labyrinth-like legal system

3231
04:29:46,966 --> 04:29:49,066
where everyone knows about his case,

3232
04:29:49,066 --> 04:29:51,366
but no one can really explain it.

3233
04:29:51,366 --> 04:29:53,100
The so-called trial

3234
04:29:53,100 --> 04:29:56,133
never actually occurs in any conventional sense.

3235
04:29:56,133 --> 04:29:58,366
Instead, Josef K's entire life

3236
04:29:58,366 --> 04:30:01,700
becomes the proceedings leading up to the trial.

3237
04:30:01,700 --> 04:30:04,200
In a sense, "The Trial" is the state

3238
04:30:04,200 --> 04:30:05,866
of being accused itself,

3239
04:30:05,866 --> 04:30:09,200
a permanent condition rather than a singular event.

3240
04:30:10,300 --> 04:30:13,333
Kafka's genius in this work was to show

3241
04:30:13,333 --> 04:30:16,833
that modern institutions don't need to hold trials,

3242
04:30:16,833 --> 04:30:18,333
they just need to hold you

3243
04:30:18,333 --> 04:30:20,600
in the permanent looming possibility of one.

3244
04:30:21,633 --> 04:30:22,966
Public attention to this case,

3245
04:30:22,966 --> 04:30:24,266
both positive and negative,

3246
04:30:24,266 --> 04:30:25,433
gives Josef K a feeling

3247
04:30:25,433 --> 04:30:28,366
of constantly being judged by people around him.

3248
04:30:28,366 --> 04:30:30,500
This wears at his mind

3249
04:30:31,366 --> 04:30:34,533
and his psychological wellbeing begins to deteriorate.

3250
04:30:35,400 --> 04:30:38,200
In a sense, the trial doesn't need to convict him.

3251
04:30:38,200 --> 04:30:40,066
The internal psychological turmoil

3252
04:30:40,066 --> 04:30:43,500
and the external social scrutiny performs a conviction

3253
04:30:43,500 --> 04:30:45,166
and the eventual execution.

3254
04:30:46,233 --> 04:30:48,200
And exactly one year after his arrest,

3255
04:30:48,200 --> 04:30:51,066
Josef K is visited by two men

3256
04:30:51,066 --> 04:30:54,300
who walk him courteously through the city

3257
04:30:54,300 --> 04:30:56,266
to an abandoned quarry

3258
04:30:56,266 --> 04:30:58,666
and stab him in the heart,

3259
04:30:58,666 --> 04:31:00,200
without Josef K resisting.

3260
04:31:01,800 --> 04:31:03,766
To me, "The Trial" shows

3261
04:31:03,766 --> 04:31:07,866
that tyranny's final victory isn't when it kills you,

3262
04:31:07,866 --> 04:31:10,333
but when you hold still for the knife,

3263
04:31:10,333 --> 04:31:12,166
not because you're forced,

3264
04:31:12,166 --> 04:31:14,933
but because you've been exhausted into submission.

3265
04:31:16,666 --> 04:31:18,966
Once again, it is a haunting story

3266
04:31:18,966 --> 04:31:21,500
of the soullessness of bureaucracy

3267
04:31:21,500 --> 04:31:23,866
and its suffocation of the human spirit.

3268
04:31:24,900 --> 04:31:26,933
I highly recommend this short book,

3269
04:31:26,933 --> 04:31:29,733
and I'll probably talk about it even more in the future.

3270
04:31:30,866 --> 04:31:32,833
I don't think it's especially useful for me

3271
04:31:32,833 --> 04:31:35,266
to speak any parallels between "The Trial"

3272
04:31:35,266 --> 04:31:36,800
and Pavel Durov's case,

3273
04:31:36,800 --> 04:31:40,066
because after all, "The Trial" is a work of fiction.

3274
04:31:41,100 --> 04:31:44,400
But on a positive note, let me report that as far as I saw,

3275
04:31:44,400 --> 04:31:46,700
Pavel has maintained optimism

3276
04:31:46,700 --> 04:31:48,100
and a general positive outlook

3277
04:31:48,100 --> 04:31:49,966
throughout this whole process.

3278
04:31:49,966 --> 04:31:52,066
What I always fear in such cases

3279
04:31:52,066 --> 04:31:54,933
is that a bureaucratic system can wear people down,

3280
04:31:54,933 --> 04:31:57,266
exhaust them into surrendering.

3281
04:31:57,266 --> 04:31:59,866
I saw none of that with Pavel.

3282
04:31:59,866 --> 04:32:02,666
I don't think he knows how to give up or give in,

3283
04:32:02,666 --> 04:32:05,400
no matter how much pressure he's under.

3284
04:32:05,400 --> 04:32:08,066
Again, this is truly inspiring to me.

3285
04:32:09,166 --> 04:32:11,933
Also, now that we're talking about it,

3286
04:32:11,933 --> 04:32:14,000
let me mention some other of Kafka's work

3287
04:32:14,000 --> 04:32:17,566
that was moving to me, "The Castle."

3288
04:32:17,566 --> 04:32:19,800
A similar description as "The Trial" does

3289
04:32:19,800 --> 04:32:22,800
of the absurd inaccessibility of those in authority

3290
04:32:22,800 --> 04:32:25,100
of the nightmarish bureaucracy.

3291
04:32:25,100 --> 04:32:27,566
The character in "The Castle" is also named K.

3292
04:32:27,566 --> 04:32:30,466
Both bureaucracies operate through exhaustion,

3293
04:32:30,466 --> 04:32:34,066
endless deferrals, procedures, waiting rooms.

3294
04:32:34,066 --> 04:32:37,366
Again, highly relevant to modern times.

3295
04:32:37,366 --> 04:32:39,300
I can also highly recommend Kafka's

3296
04:32:39,300 --> 04:32:42,733
"In the Penal Colony" and "Hunger Artist."

3297
04:32:42,733 --> 04:32:46,266
Both are too interesting and weird

3298
04:32:46,266 --> 04:32:49,300
to explain in depth here.

3299
04:32:49,300 --> 04:32:51,200
But let me say, "The Hunger Artist" is a story

3300
04:32:51,200 --> 04:32:52,066
that I think is relevant

3301
04:32:52,066 --> 04:32:54,166
to our modern-day attention economy,

3302
04:32:54,166 --> 04:32:56,700
where so many people want to be famous.

3303
04:32:56,700 --> 04:33:00,466
It tells the story of a, let's say, professional faster

3304
04:33:00,466 --> 04:33:04,633
who performs starvation in a cage as entertainment,

3305
04:33:04,633 --> 04:33:08,099
and he slowly loses his audience to newer spectacles,

3306
04:33:08,099 --> 04:33:08,933
so much so

3307
04:33:08,933 --> 04:33:11,065
that eventually when he starves himself

3308
04:33:11,065 --> 04:33:13,200
to death, nobody cares.

3309
04:33:14,766 --> 04:33:16,933
Kafka's work is heavy.

3310
04:33:16,933 --> 04:33:19,200
It serves as a warning for the nightmare

3311
04:33:19,200 --> 04:33:21,166
that civilization can become,

3312
04:33:21,166 --> 04:33:23,933
and yet I think it is also a source of optimism,

3313
04:33:23,933 --> 04:33:25,866
because when we can recognize elements

3314
04:33:25,866 --> 04:33:28,200
of our own world in Kafka's stories,

3315
04:33:28,200 --> 04:33:30,233
when we can see elements of our institutions

3316
04:33:30,233 --> 04:33:31,966
in "The Trial" or in "The Castle,"

3317
04:33:31,966 --> 04:33:34,766
when we can see ourselves in Gregor Samsa,

3318
04:33:34,766 --> 04:33:37,166
we're not just diagnosing the disease,

3319
04:33:37,166 --> 04:33:39,800
we're proving that we're still human

3320
04:33:39,800 --> 04:33:42,065
and wise enough to see it and name it.

3321
04:33:42,933 --> 04:33:44,866
Kafka gave us the goal

3322
04:33:44,866 --> 04:33:48,500
to resist against such systems that try to dehumanize us

3323
04:33:48,500 --> 04:33:50,832
and to ensure that individual freedom

3324
04:33:50,832 --> 04:33:53,400
and the human spirit keep flourishing.

3325
04:33:53,400 --> 04:33:54,866
I think it will.

3326
04:33:54,866 --> 04:33:57,466
I have faith in us humans.

3327
04:33:57,466 --> 04:33:58,400
I love you all.
