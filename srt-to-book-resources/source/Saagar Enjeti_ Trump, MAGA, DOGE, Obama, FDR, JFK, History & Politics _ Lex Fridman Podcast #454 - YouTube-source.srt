1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,020
- So people need to go back

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,540
and read the history of the first 100 days under FDR,

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,400
the sheer amount of legislation that went through,

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,440
his ability to bring Congress to heel

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,273
and the Senate.

6
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:09,420
He gets all this stuff through.

7
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,290
But as you and I know,

8
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,540
legislation takes a long time to put into place, right?

9
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,100
We've had people starving on the streets

10
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,830
all throughout 1933 under Hoover.

11
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,000
The difference was, Hoover was seen as this do nothing joke,

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,250
who would dine nine course meals in the White House

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,870
and he is a filthy rich banker,

14
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,820
FDR comes in there

15
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,250
and every single day has seen fireside chats,

16
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,870
he's passing legislation.

17
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,040
But more importantly,

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,320
so he tries various different programs.

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,840
Then they get ruled unconstitutional, he tries even more.

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,340
So what does America take away from that?

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,480
Every single time,

22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,310
if he gets knocked down, he comes back fighting.

23
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,230
And that was a really part of his character

24
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,900
that he developed after he got polio.

25
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,250
And it was, it gave him the strength to persevere through

26
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,750
personally what he could transfer in his calm demeanor

27
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,740
and his feeling of fight that America really got

28
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,360
that spirit from him

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,360
and was able to climb itself out of the Great Depression.

30
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,769
He's such an inspirational figure.

31
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,170
I think of Johnson and of Nixon,

32
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,690
of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR,

33
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,790
I can give you a laundry list of

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,100
personal problems that all those people had.

35
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,080
I think they had a really, really good judgment

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,670
and I'm not sure

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,850
how intrinsic their own personal character was

38
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,180
to their exploration and thinking about the world.

39
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,940
So JFK is actually, JFK might be our best example

40
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,330
because he had the best judgment out of anybody in a room

41
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,360
as a brand new president in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,790
And he got us out and avoided nuclear war,

43
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,890
which he deserves eternal credit for that.

44
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,730
And I encourage people out there, this is a brutal text.

45
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,070
We were forced to read it in graduate school.

46
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,140
The "Essence of Decision" by Graham Allison.

47
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,490
I'm so thankful we did.

48
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,040
It's one of the foundations of political science

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,740
because it lays out theories of how government works.

50
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,710
People really need to understand Washington.

51
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,590
Washington is a creature with traditions,

52
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,440
with institutions that don't care about you.

53
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,360
They don't even really care about the president.

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,400
They have self-perpetuating mechanisms

55
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,170
which have been done a certain way.

56
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,600
And it usually takes a great shocking event

57
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,450
like World War II to change really anything

58
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,770
beyond the marginal.

59
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,603
Every once in a while,

60
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:15,990
you have a figure like Teddy Roosevelt

61
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,060
who's actually able to take peacetime presidency

62
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,200
and transform the country,

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,790
but it needs an extraordinary individual

64
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,410
to get something like that done.

65
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,710
So the question around the "Essence of Decision" was

66
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,450
the theory behind the Cuban Missile Crisis

67
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,900
of how Kennedy arrived at his decision.

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,910
And there are various different schools of thought,

69
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,950
but one of the things I love about the book is it presents

70
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,680
a case for all three, the organizational theory,

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
the bureaucratic politics theory,

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,640
and then kind of the great man theory as well.

73
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,927
So there's a, you know, you and I could sit here

74
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:46,380
and I could tell you a case about PT-109

75
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,620
and about how John F. Kennedy experienced World War II

76
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,960
and how he literally swam miles

77
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,350
with a wounded man's life jacket strap in his teeth

78
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,967
with a broken back and he saved him

79
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,830
and he ended up on the cover of Life Magazine

80
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,160
and he was a war hero and he was a deeply smart individual

81
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,760
who wrote a book in 1939 called "Why England Slept,"

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,810
which to this day is considered a text,

83
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,350
which at the moment was able to describe in detail

84
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,520
why Neville Chamberlain

85
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,560
and the British political system arrived

86
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,520
at the policy of appeasement.

87
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,380
I actually have a original copy.

88
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,000
It's one of my most prized possessions.

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
Because, and from 1939,

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,450
because this is a 23-year-old kid,

91
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,520
who the fuck are you, John F. Kennedy?

92
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,960
Turns out he's a brilliant man.

93
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,390
And another just favorite aside is that

94
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,010
at the Potsdam Conference, you know,

95
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,260
where Harry Truman is there with Stalin and everybody.

96
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,850
So in the room at the same time,

97
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,740
Harry S. Truman, president of the United States,

98
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,260
Dwight D. Eisenhower, the general, right,

99
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,430
who will succeed him,

100
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,880
26-year-old John F. Kennedy as a journalist.

101
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,430
And all three of those presidents were in the same room

102
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,110
with Joseph Stalin and others.

103
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,270
And that's the story of America right there.

104
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,110
It's kind of amazing.

105
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,060
I'm gonna give you one of the most depressing quotes,

106
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,590
which is deeply true.

107
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,690
Roger Ailes, who is a genius,

108
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,580
shout out to "The Loudest Voice in the Room"

109
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,250
by Gabriel Sherman, that book changed my life too,

110
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,230
because it really made me understand media.

111
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,080
People don't wanna be informed, they wanna feel informed.

112
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,780
- The following is a conversation with Saagar Enjeti,

113
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,760
his second time in the podcast.

114
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,519
Saagar is a political commentator, journalist,

115
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,149
co-host of "Breaking Points" with Krystal Ball

116
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,150
and of "The Realignment" podcast with Marshall Kosloff.

117
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,570
Saagar is one of the most well-read people I've ever met.

118
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,000
His love of history and the wisdom gained

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,910
from reading thousands of history books radiates through

120
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,593
every analysis he makes of the world.

121
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:41,280
In this podcast, we trace out the history

122
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,920
of the various ideological movements that led up

123
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,960
to the current political moment.

124
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,760
In doing so, we mention a large number of amazing books.

125
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,280
We'll put a link to them in the description

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,880
for those interested to learn more about each topic.

127
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,130
This is a "Lex Fridman Podcast."

130
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,990
And now, dear friends, here is Saagar Enjeti.

131
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,120
So let's start with the obvious big question.

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,310
Why do you think Trump won?

133
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,510
Let's break it down.

134
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,690
Before the election, you said that if Trump wins,

135
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,970
it's going to be because of immigration.

136
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,120
- Hmm. - So aside from immigration,

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,290
what are the maybe less than obvious reasons that Trump won?

138
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,330
- Yes, we absolutely need to return to immigration,

139
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,060
but without that multifaceted explanation,

140
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,770
let's start with the easiest one.

141
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,860
There has been a wave of anti-incumbent energy

142
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,693
around the world.

143
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:38,340
Financial Times chart recently went viral showing,

144
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,560
so the first time, I think since World War II,

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,290
possibly since 1905, I need to look at the dataset,

146
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,200
that all anti-incumbent parties all across the world

147
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,190
suffered major defeat.

148
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,800
So that's a very, very high level analysis

149
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,630
and we can return to that if we talk about

150
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,057
Donald Trump's victory in 2016

151
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:56,070
'cause there were similar like global precursors.

152
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,320
That individual level in the United States,

153
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,030
there's a very simple explanation as well,

154
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,680
which is that Joe Biden was very old,

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,050
he was very unpopular, inflation was high.

156
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,330
Inflation is one of the highest determiners

157
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,740
of people switching their votes

158
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,930
and of putting their primacy on that

159
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,180
ahead of any other issue at the ballot box.

160
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,000
So that's that, but I think it's actually much deeper

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,840
at a psychological level for who America is and what it is.

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,520
And fundamentally, I think what we're gonna spend

163
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,390
a lot of time talking about today is the evolution

164
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,790
of the modern left and its collapse

165
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,560
in the Kamala Harris candidacy

166
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,340
and eventually, the loss to Donald Trump in the popular vote

167
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,090
where really is like an apotheosis of several social forces.

168
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,070
So we're gonna talk about the great awakening,

169
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,560
or so-called awokening, which is very important

170
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,270
to understanding all of this.

171
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,070
There's also really Donald Trump himself,

172
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,080
who was really one of the most unique

173
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,430
individual American politicians that we've seen in decades.

174
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,560
At this point, Donald Trump's victory makes him

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,660
the most important and transformative figure

176
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,240
in American politics since FDR.

177
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,570
And a thought process for the audience is, in 2028,

178
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,330
there will be an 18-year-old who's eligible to vote,

179
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,580
who cannot remember a time

180
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,490
when Donald J. Trump was not the central American figure.

181
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,010
And there's stories in World War II

182
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,480
where troops were on the front lines.

183
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,130
Some of they were 18, 19 years old,

184
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,517
FDR died and they literally said,

185
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:16,710
"Well, who's the president?"

186
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,480
And they said, "Harry Truman, you dumb ass."

187
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,590
And they go, "Who?"

188
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,750
They couldn't conceive of a universe

189
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,140
where FDR was not the president of the United States.

190
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,730
And, you know, Donald Trump,

191
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,880
even during the Biden administration, he was the figure.

192
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,070
Joe Biden defined his entire candidacy

193
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,080
and his legacy around defeating this man

194
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,490
and obviously, he's failed.

195
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,050
We should talk a lot about Joe Biden as well

196
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,780
for his own failed theories of the presidency.

197
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,270
So I think, at a macro level,

198
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,500
it's easy to understand.

199
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,930
At a basic level, inflation, it's easy to understand.

200
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,390
But what I really hope that a lot of people can take away is

201
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,760
how fundamentally unique Donald Trump is

202
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,670
as a political figure and what he was able to do

203
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,950
to realign American politics really forever.

204
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,260
I mean in the white working class realignment

205
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,150
originally of 2016,

206
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,000
the activation really of a multiracial

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,650
kind of working class coalition

208
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,260
and of really splitting American lines

209
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,380
along a single individual question of did you attend

210
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,350
a four-year college degree institution or not?

211
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,660
And this is a crazy thing to say,

212
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,500
Donald Trump is one of the most racially depolarizing

213
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,110
electoral figures in American history.

214
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,460
We lived in 2016 at a time when racial groups, you know,

215
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,790
really voted in blocks, Latinos, Blacks, whites.

216
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,260
There was some, of course, division

217
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,850
between the white working class

218
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:37,289
and the white college educated, white collar workers.

219
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,870
But by and large, you could pretty fairly say

220
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,630
that Asians were gonna, Indians, everyone,

221
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,720
80, 90% were gonna vote for the Democratic Party.

222
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,860
Latinos as well.

223
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm born, you know, here in Texas, in the State of Texas,

224
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,440
George W. Bush shocked people when he won some 40%

225
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,610
of the Latino vote.

226
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,090
Donald Trump just beat Kamala Harris with Latino men

227
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,190
and he ran up the table for young men.

228
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,110
So really fundamentally,

229
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,770
we have witnessed a full realignment in American politics.

230
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,780
And that's a really fundamental problem

231
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,370
for the modern left is erase

232
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,250
a lot of the conversation around gerrymandering,

233
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,530
around the electoral college,

234
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,800
the so-called electoral college bias towards Republicans.

235
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,680
Really the, being able to win the popular vote

236
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,230
for the first time since 2004 is shocking

237
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,720
and landmark achievement by a Republican.

238
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,660
In 2008, I have a book on my shelf and I never,

239
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,550
and I always look at it to remind myself

240
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,810
how much things can change,

241
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,360
James Carville and it says "40 More Years,"

242
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,630
how Democrats will never lose an election again.

243
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,050
2008, they wrote that book after the Obama coalition

244
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,950
and the landslide.

245
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,490
And something I love so much about this country,

246
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,860
people change their minds all the time.

247
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,710
I was born in 1992, I watched red states go blue,

248
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,150
I've seen blue states go red.

249
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,010
I've seen swing states go red or blue.

250
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,530
I've seen millions of people pick up and move

251
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,900
the greatest internal migration in the United States

252
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,100
since World War II.

253
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,840
And it's really inspiring

254
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,270
because it's a really dynamic, interesting place.

255
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,250
And I love covering and I love thinking about it,

256
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,960
talking about it, talking to people.

257
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,160
It's awesome.

258
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,470
- One of the reasons I'm a big fan of yours is

259
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,520
you're a student of history

260
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,570
and so you've recommended a bunch of books to me and they,

261
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,820
and others thread the different movements

262
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,320
throughout American history.

263
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,140
Some movements take off and do hold power for a long time.

264
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,250
Some don't and some are started by a small number of people

265
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,990
and are controlled by a small number of people,

266
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,160
some are mass movements

267
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
and it's just fascinating to watch

268
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,200
how those movements evolve

269
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,440
and then fit themselves maybe into the constraints

270
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,910
of a two-party system.

271
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,710
And I'd love to sort of talk about

272
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,360
the various perspectives of that.

273
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,010
So would it be fair to say that this election was turned

274
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,810
into a kind of class struggle?

275
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,370
- Well, I won't go that far

276
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,580
because to say it's a class struggle really implies

277
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,040
that things fundamentally align on economic lines.

278
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,170
And I don't think that's necessarily accurate.

279
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,110
Although if that's your lens, you could get there.

280
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,070
So there's a very big statistic going around right now

281
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,320
where Kamala Harris increased her vote share

282
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,410
and won households over $100,000 or more,

283
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,870
and Donald Trump won households under 100,000.

284
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,930
So you could view that in an economic lens.

285
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,940
The problem again that I have is that

286
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,290
that is much more a proxy

287
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,540
for four-year college degree and for education.

288
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,240
And so one of my favorite books is called "Coming Apart"

289
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,620
by Charles Murray.

290
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,590
And that book really, really underscores

291
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,850
how the cultural milieu that people swim in

292
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,740
when they attend a four-year college degree

293
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,210
and the trajectory of their life,

294
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,090
not only on where they move to, who they marry,

295
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,870
what type of grocery store they go to, their cultural,

296
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,580
what television shows that they watch.

297
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,690
One of my favorite questions

298
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,030
from Charles Murray is called a "Bubble Quiz."

299
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,740
I encourage people to go take it by the way,

300
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,150
which it asks you a question.

301
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,480
It's like, what does the word Branson mean to you?

302
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,890
And it has a couple of answers.

303
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,260
One of them is Branson is Richard Branson,

304
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,310
Sir Richard Branson.

305
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,810
Number two is Branson, Missouri,

306
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,450
which is like a country music tourist style destination.

307
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,010
Three is, it means nothing.

308
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,950
So you are less in a bubble if you say country music.

309
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,110
And you're very much in the bubble

310
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,500
if you say Richard Branson.

311
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,817
And I remember taking that test for the first time, I go,

312
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:16,920
"Obviously, Sir Richard Branson,

313
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,300
Virgin Atlantic, like what?"

314
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,730
And then I was like, "Wait, I'm like, I'm in the bubble."

315
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,440
And there are other things in there like,

316
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,480
can you name various different military ranks?

317
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,820
I can 'cause I'm a history nerd but the vast majority

318
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,830
of college educated people don't know anybody served

319
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,060
in the United States military.

320
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,310
They don't have family members who do.

321
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,057
The most popular shows in America are like

322
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,450
"The Big Bang Theory" and "NCIS."

323
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,870
Whereas people in our probably cultural milieu,

324
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,973
our favorite shows are "White Lotus," "The Last of Us."

325
00:12:41,973 --> 00:12:44,130
This is prestige television, right,

326
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,560
with a very small audience, but high income, high education.

327
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,520
So the point is, is that culture really defines who we are

328
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,320
as Americans where we live.

329
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,840
And rural urban is one way to describe it,

330
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,600
but honestly with the work from home revolution

331
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,160
and more rich people

332
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,070
and highly educated people moving to more rural suburban

333
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,770
or areas they traditionally weren't able to commute in,

334
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,603
that's changing.

335
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:08,250
And so really, and the internet is everything.

336
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,990
The stuff that you consume on the internet,

337
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,580
the stuff that you spend your time doing,

338
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,413
type of books you read,

339
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:14,070
whether you read a book at all, frankly,

340
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,130
whether you travel to Europe, whether you have a passport,

341
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,290
you know, all the things that you value in your life,

342
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,630
that is the real cultural divide in America.

343
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,160
And I actually think that's what,

344
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,910
this revolution of Donald Trump was activating

345
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,860
and bringing people to the polls,

346
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,740
bringing a lot of those traditional working class voters

347
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,590
of all races away from the Democratic Party

348
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,550
along the lines of elitism, of sneering,

349
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,560
and of a general cultural feeling

350
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,270
that these people don't understand me

351
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,190
and my struggles in this life.

352
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,757
- And so the trivial formulation is that is the wokeism,

353
00:13:47,757 --> 00:13:49,350
the anti-wokeism movement.

354
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,750
- Yeah. - So it's not necessarily

355
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,942
that Trump winning was a statement against wokeism,

356
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:57,780
it was the broader anti-elitism.

357
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,210
- It's difficult to say because I wouldn't dismiss

358
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,810
anti-wokeism or wokeism as an explanation.

359
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,340
But we need to understand

360
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,380
like the electoral impacts of woke.

361
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,840
So there's varying degrees of like

362
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,423
how you're going to encounter quote unquote "wokeism."

363
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:15,360
And this is a very difficult thing to define.

364
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,710
So let me just try and break it down,

365
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,960
which is there are the types of things

366
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,660
that you're going to interact with on a cultural basis.

367
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,470
And what I mean by that is going to watch a TV show

368
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,990
and just for some reason there's like two trans characters

369
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,910
and it's never like particularly explained why,

370
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,640
they just are there, or watching a commercial

371
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,110
and it's the same thing.

372
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,120
Watching, I don't know, I remember I was watching,

373
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,730
I think it was "Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"

374
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,770
and the main, it was a terrible movie by the way,

375
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,820
I don't recommend it.

376
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,290
But one of the characters, I think is,

377
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,250
her name was like America

378
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,900
and she wore a gay pride flag, right?

379
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,940
Look, many left-wingers would make fun of me

380
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,840
for saying these things,

381
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,440
but that is obviously a social agenda to the point

382
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,710
as in they believe it is like deeply acceptable that is used

383
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,450
by Hollywood and cultural elites

384
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,570
who really value those progress, you know,

385
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,820
in sexual orientation and others,

386
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,930
really believe it's important

387
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,300
to quote unquote "showcase" it for representation.

388
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,040
So that's like one way that we may encounter

389
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,300
quote unquote "wokeism,"

390
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,090
but the more important ways, frankly, are the ways

391
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,000
that affirmative action, which really has its roots in,

392
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,250
you know, American society all the way going back

393
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,330
to the 1960s and how those have manifested in our economy

394
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,180
and in our understanding of quote unquote "discrimination."

395
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,680
So two books I can recommend.

396
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,510
One is called "The Origins of Woke,"

397
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,190
that's by Richard Hanania.

398
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,320
There's another one by "The Age of Entitlement"

399
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,670
by Christopher Caldwell.

400
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,190
And they make a very strong case that,

401
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,020
Caldwell in particular, that he calls it

402
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,570
like a new founding of America, was the passage

403
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,030
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

404
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,970
because it created an entire new legal regime

405
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,760
and understanding of race in the American character

406
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,190
and how the government was going to enforce that.

407
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,800
And that really ties in with another one of the books

408
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,140
that I recommended to you about the origins of Trump

409
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,280
by Jim Webb.

410
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,000
And Senator Jim Webb. incredible, incredible man.

411
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,040
He's so underappreciated.

412
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,230
Intellectual, he was anti-war

413
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,820
and he was, people may remember him from the 2016 primary

414
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,710
and they asked him,

415
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,543
they'd asked him a question,

416
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,560
I don't exactly remember about one of his enemies.

417
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,163
And he is like, "Well, one of them was a guy

418
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:16,800
I shot in Vietnam."

419
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
And he was running against Hillary.

420
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,360
And that guy the, he wrote the book "Born Fighting,"

421
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,430
I think it's history of the Scots-Irish people,

422
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,510
something like that.

423
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,200
And that book really opened my eyes to the way

424
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,020
that affirmative action and racial preferences

425
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,280
that were playing out, you know,

426
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,520
through the HR, managerial elite,

427
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,180
really turned a lot of people within the white working class

428
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,310
away from the Democratic Party

429
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,860
and felt fundamentally discriminated against

430
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,500
by the professional managerial class.

431
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,097
And so there's a lot of roots to this,

432
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:50,670
"The Managerial Revolution" by James Burnham.

433
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,520
And in terms of the origin of kind of how we got here,

434
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,407
but the crystallization of like DEI

435
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:58,890
and/or affirmative action,

436
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,720
I prefer to use the term affirmative action,

437
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,030
in the highest echelons of business.

438
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,710
And there became this idea

439
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,440
that representation itself was the only thing that mattered.

440
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,569
And I think that right around 2014

441
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,130
that really went on steroids.

442
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,270
And that's why it's not an accident

443
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,819
Donald J. Trump elected in 2016.

444
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,839
- At this point.

445
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,000
Do you think this election is the kind of statement

446
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,280
that wokeism as a movement is dead?

447
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,240
- I don't know.

448
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,560
I mean it's very difficult to say

449
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,900
because wokeism itself is not a movement

450
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,069
with a party leader.

451
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,360
It's a amorphous belief that has worked its way

452
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,960
through institutions now for almost 40 or 50 years.

453
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,700
I mean, it's effectively a religion

454
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,680
and part of the reason why it's difficult

455
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,270
to find is it means done different things

456
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,230
to different people.

457
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,690
So for example, there are varying degrees

458
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,270
of how we would define quote unquote "woke."

459
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:47,700
Do I think that the Democrats will be speaking

460
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,590
in so-called academic language?

461
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,730
Yes, I do think they will.

462
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,490
I think that the next democratic nominee will not do that.

463
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,370
However, Kamala Harris actually did move

464
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,890
as much as she could away from quote unquote "woke"

465
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,070
but she basically was punished for a lot of the sins

466
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,530
of both herself from 2019,

467
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,750
but a general cultural feeling that her

468
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,270
and the people around her do not understand me

469
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,620
and not only do not understand me,

470
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,380
but have racial preferences or a regime

471
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,090
or an understanding that would lead

472
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,950
to a quote unquote "equity mindset,"

473
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,525
you know, equal outcomes for everybody

474
00:18:18,525 --> 00:18:20,730
as opposed to equality of opportunity,

475
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,070
which is more of a colorblind philosophy.

476
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,160
So I can't say, I think it's way too early

477
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,690
and, you know, again, like you can not use the word Latinx,

478
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,820
but do you still believe

479
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,777
in an effective affirmative action regime?

480
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:37,020
You know, in terms of how you would run

481
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,610
your Department of Justice?

482
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,920
In terms of how you view the world?

483
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,220
In terms of what you think the real dividing lines

484
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,180
in America are?

485
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,650
'Cause I would say that's still actually

486
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,760
kind of a woke mindset.

487
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,010
And that's part of the reason why the term itself

488
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,360
doesn't really mean a whole lot.

489
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,430
And we have to get actually really specific

490
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,860
about what it looks like in operations.

491
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,990
In operation, it means affirmative action,

492
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,600
it means the Nasdaq passing some law

493
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,520
that if you wanna go public or something,

494
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,840
that you have to have a woman

495
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,400
and a person of color on your board.

496
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,030
Like this is a blatant and extraordinary look racialism

497
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,580
that they've enshrined in their bylaws.

498
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,830
So you can get rid of ESG, that's great,

499
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,440
but, you know, you can get rid of DEI, I think that's great,

500
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,867
but it's really about a mindset and a view of the world

501
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,730
and I don't think that's going anywhere.

502
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,550
- And you think the reason it doesn't work well

503
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,680
in practice is because it,

504
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,070
there's a big degree to which it's anti-meritocracy,

505
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,390
- It's anti-American, really.

506
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,340
I mean, you know, DEI and woke,

507
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,350
and affirmative action make perfect sense

508
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,420
in a lot of different countries, okay?

509
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,830
There are a lot of countries out there

510
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:41,910
that are multi-ethnic and they're heterogeneous

511
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,000
and they were run by basically quasi dictators.

512
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,790
And the way it works is that you pay off the Christians

513
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,430
and they pay off the Muslims and they get this guy

514
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,963
and they get that guy and everybody kinda shakes it.

515
00:19:51,963 --> 00:19:53,310
It's very explicit where they're like,

516
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,990
we have 10 spots and they go to the Christians,

517
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,000
we have 10 spots, and there goes the Hindus,

518
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,833
you know, I'm talking,

519
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,160
India's a country I know pretty well

520
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,780
and this does kind of work like that

521
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,850
on state politics level in some respect.

522
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,640
But in America, you know, fundamentally, we really believe

523
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,760
that no matter where you are from that you come here

524
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,380
and basically, within a generation,

525
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,690
especially if you migrate here legally

526
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,750
and you integrate that you leave a lot of that stuff behind.

527
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,450
And the story, the American dream that is ingrained

528
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,010
in so many of us is one that really does not mesh well

529
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,190
with any sort of racial preference regime

530
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,340
or anything that's not meritocratic.

531
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,980
And I mean, I will give the left-wingers some,

532
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,520
you know, credit in the idea that meritocracy itself,

533
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,440
you know, could have preference for people

534
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,550
who have privileged backgrounds.

535
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,990
I think that's true.

536
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,130
And so, you know,

537
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,800
the way I would like to see it is to increase

538
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,200
everybody's equality of opportunity

539
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,540
to make sure that they all have a chance

540
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,640
at quote unquote "willing out the American dream."

541
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,400
But that doesn't erase meritocracy, hard work,

542
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,800
and many of the other things that we associate

543
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,320
with the American character, with the American frontier.

544
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,590
So these are two ideologies which are really at odds,

545
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,840
like in a lot of ways, like wokeism, racialism,

546
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,820
and all this is a third world ideology.

547
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,470
It's one that's very prevalent in Europe

548
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,380
and in all across Asia but it doesn't mix well here.

549
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,760
And it shouldn't and I'm really glad

550
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,280
that the America feels the same way.

551
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,130
- Yeah, I got to go back to Jim Webb in that book.

552
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,933
What a badass, fascinating book.

553
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:19,766
- [Saagar] Oh, my God.

554
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:20,820
It's the most amazing. - "Born Fighting:

555
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,830
How the Scots-Irish Shaped America."

556
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,040
So I did not realize to the degree,

557
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,070
first of all how badass the Scots-Irish are

558
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,360
and that to the degree,

559
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,000
many of the things that kind of identify as American

560
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,920
and part of the American spirit were defined

561
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,680
by this relatively small

562
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,180
group of people. - Yes, yeah.

563
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,130
- As he describes the motto could be summarized

564
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,990
as fight, think, drink and pray.

565
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,440
So there's the principles of fierce individualism,

566
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,230
the principles of a deep distrust of government, the elites,

567
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,080
the authorities, bottom-up governance,

568
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,200
over 2000 years of a military tradition,

569
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,250
they made up 40% of the Revolutionary War army

570
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,440
and produced numerous military leaders

571
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,620
including Stonewall Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant,

572
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,840
George S. Patton, and a bunch of presidents.

573
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,673
- Yeah.

574
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,300
- Some of the more gangster presidents,

575
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,630
Andrew Jackson, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson,

576
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,700
Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.

577
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,533
- Hmm. - Just the,

578
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:18,930
the whole cultural legacy of country music.

579
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,130
- We owe them so much

580
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,560
and they really don't get their due, unfortunately.

581
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,690
A lot of big, for the reasons that I just described

582
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,670
around racialism is because

583
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,520
post, you know, mass immigration from Europe,

584
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,910
the term white kind of became blanket applied to new Irish,

585
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,430
to Italians, to Slovenians.

586
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:37,230
And, you know, as you and I both know,

587
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,390
if you travel those countries, people are pretty different.

588
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,720
And it's not different here in the United States,

589
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,420
Scots-Irish are some of the original settlers here

590
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,180
in America, and particularly in Appalachia,

591
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,700
and their contribution to the fighting spirit

592
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,280
and their own culture and like who we are as individualists

593
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,130
and some of the first people to ever settle the frontier.

594
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,590
And that frontier mindset really does come from them.

595
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,690
We owe them just as much we do the Puritans

596
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,430
but they don't ever really get their due.

597
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,020
And the reason I recommend that book is

598
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,360
if you read that book and you understand then,

599
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,280
you know, how exactly could this group

600
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,550
of white working class voters forgo from 2012 voting

601
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,180
for a man named Barack Hussein Obama to Donald J. Trump.

602
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,360
You really seem to, it makes perfect sense if you combine it

603
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,460
with a lot of the stuff I'm talking about here,

604
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,310
about affirmative action, about distrust of the elites,

605
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,940
about feeling as if institutions are not seeing through

606
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,840
to you and specifically also not valuing your contribution

607
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,980
to American history.

608
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,177
And in some cases, actively looking down.

609
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:36,780
You know, I'm glad you pointed out not only their role

610
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,600
in the Revolutionary War but in the Civil War as well.

611
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,210
And, you know, just how much of a contribution

612
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,670
culturally really that we owe them

613
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,620
for setting the groundwork that so many of us

614
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,390
who came later could build upon

615
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,950
and adopt some of their own ideas

616
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,420
and their culture as our own.

617
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,100
It's one of the things that makes America great.

618
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,663
- Mark Twain. - Yeah.

619
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,680
- I mean, so much of the culture, so much of the, yeah,

620
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,010
the American spirit, the whole idea, the whole shape

621
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,420
and form and type of populism that represents our democracy.

622
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,870
So you, would you trace that fierce individualism

623
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,090
that we think of back to them?

624
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,880
- Definitely, it's a huge part of them about who they were,

625
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,830
about the screw-you attitude.

626
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,980
I mean, that book actually kind of had a renaissance

627
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,290
back in 2016 when "Hillbilly Elegy" came out.

628
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,700
- Oh, yeah. - I'm sure you remember this.

629
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,710
Which, it's kind of weird to think that he,

630
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,960
he's now the Vice President-elect of the United States.

631
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,450
It's kind of wild, honestly to think about.

632
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,460
But JD Vance's book, "Hillbilly Elegy,"

633
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,000
I think was really important for a lot of American elites

634
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,617
who were like, "How do these people support Trump?"

635
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:39,810
"Where does this shit come from?"

636
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,800
That they really, I mean that

637
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,620
if you really think back to that time, it was shocking

638
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,760
to the elite character

639
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,370
that any person in the world could ever vote

640
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,070
for Donald Trump and, not just vote, he won the election.

641
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,903
How does that happen?

642
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:53,250
And that's "Hillbilly Elegy" guided people

643
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,083
in an understanding

644
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,610
of what that's like on a lived day-to-day basis.

645
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,910
And JD, to his credit, talks about Scots-Irish heritage

646
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,770
about Appalachia and the legacy

647
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,510
of what that culture looks like today

648
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,250
and how a lot of these people voted for Donald Trump,

649
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,890
but we got to give credit to Jim Webb who wrote the history

650
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,810
of these people and taught me and you

651
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,820
about, you know, their original fight

652
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,540
against the oppressors in Scotland, in Ireland

653
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,160
and their militant spirit

654
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,890
and how they were able to bring that over here.

655
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,560
And, you know, they got their due in Andrew Jackson

656
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,630
and some of our other populous presidents

657
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,980
who set us up on the road

658
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,450
to Donald Trump to where we are today.

659
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,820
- Dude, you got me pumped, excited to be an American.

660
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,050
- Me too, I love that book.

661
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,450
- It's crazy that JD, the same guy,

662
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,770
because that's, "Hillbilly Elegy" is what I kind of

663
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,970
thought of him as.

664
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,080
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'll tell you,

665
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
for me, it's actually pretty surreal.

666
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,470
I met JD Vance in like 2017.

667
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,510
I didn't ever, in like a bar,

668
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,150
I didn't ever think he would be the vice president-elect

669
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,185
of the United States.

670
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:50,760
I mean, just kind of wild.

671
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,590
One of my friends went back and dug up

672
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,120
the email that we originally sent him,

673
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,260
just like, "Hey, do you wanna meet up?"

674
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,877
And he was like, "Sure," you know, okay. (laughs)

675
00:25:56,877 --> 00:25:59,550
And I was watching on television.

676
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,020
I mean, the first time that it really hit me,

677
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,030
I was like, "Whoa, and he's like name in a history book."

678
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,263
It's whenever he became the vice presidential nominee,

679
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,470
I was watching him on TV and the confetti was falling

680
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,930
and he was waving with his wife and I was like, "Wow."

681
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,763
Like, that's it, you're in,

682
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:13,110
you're in the history books now forever,

683
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,860
especially now so as the literal vice president-elect

684
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,693
of the U.S.

685
00:26:17,693 --> 00:26:20,553
But his own evolution is actually a fascinating,

686
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:23,670
a fascinating story for us too.

687
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,380
Because I think a lot of the time

688
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,610
I've spent right now is kind of, this,

689
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,470
a lot of what I'm giving right now are like

690
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,190
2016 kind of takes about like why Trump won that time.

691
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,270
But we just spent a lot of time

692
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,530
on how Donald Trump won this election

693
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:37,410
and like how, what happened, some of the failures

694
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,850
of the Biden administration,

695
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,310
some of the payback for the great awokening.

696
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,550
But also if you look at the evolution of JD Vance,

697
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,980
this is a person who wrote "Hillbilly Elegy."

698
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,570
And not a lot of people pay attention to this,

699
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,730
but if you read "Hillbilly Elegy,"

700
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,270
JD was much more of a traditional conservative at that time.

701
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,770
He was citing, you know, report.

702
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,930
I think the famous passage is about like payday loans

703
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,670
and why they're good or something like that.

704
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,750
I don't know his position today,

705
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,870
but I would assume that he's probably changed that.

706
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,510
But the point is, is that his ideological evolution

707
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:10,140
from watching somebody who really was more

708
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,990
of a traditional Republican with a deep empathy

709
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:16,290
for the white working class than eventually become

710
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:19,110
a champion and a disciple of Donald Trump.

711
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,570
And to believe that he himself was the vehicle

712
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,090
for accomplishing and bettering the United States,

713
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:26,340
but specifically for working class Americans,

714
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,480
really of all stripes.

715
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,480
And that story is really one of the rise of the modern left

716
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,170
as it exists as a political project, as an ideology.

717
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,500
It's also one of the Republican party which coalesced now

718
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,900
with Donald Trump as a legitimate figure

719
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,540
and as the single bulwark against cultural leftism

720
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,420
and elitism that eventually was normalized to the point

721
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,960
that majority of Americans decided to vote for him in 2024.

722
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,520
- So let's talk about 2024.

723
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,180
What happened with the left?

724
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,230
What happened with Biden?

725
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,820
What's your take on Biden?

726
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,507
- Biden is, I try to remove myself from it

727
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:07,200
and I try not to give like hit big history takes

728
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,580
while you're in the moment.

729
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,990
But it's really hard not to say

730
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:12,060
that he's one of the worst presidents in modern history.

731
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,020
And I think the reason why I'm gonna go with it is because

732
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,720
I wanna judge him by the things that he set out to do.

733
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,050
So Joe Biden has been the same person

734
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,730
for his entire political career.

735
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,560
He is a basically C student who thinks he's an A student.

736
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,040
The chip on his shoulder against the elites has played

737
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,320
to his benefit in his original election

738
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,700
to the United States Senate

739
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,530
through his entire career as a United States Senator,

740
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,760
where he always wanted to be the star

741
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,780
and the center of attention

742
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,210
and to his 1988 presidential campaign.

743
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,370
And one of the most fascinating things about Biden

744
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:47,160
and watching him age is watching him become even more

745
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,420
of what he already was.

746
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,690
And so, book recommendation, it's called "What It Takes."

747
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,760
And it was written in 1988

748
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,460
and there's actually a long chapter on Joe Biden

749
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,290
and about the plagiarism scandal.

750
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,220
And one of the things

751
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,200
that comes across is his sheer arrogance

752
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,610
and belief in himself

753
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,710
as to why he should be the center of attention.

754
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,240
Now the reason I'm laying all this out is

755
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,560
the arrogance of Joe Biden,

756
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,410
the individual and his character is fundamentally the reason

757
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:12,120
that his presidency went awry.

758
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,180
This is a person who was elected in 2020,

759
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:19,470
really because of a feeling of chaos of Donald Trump,

760
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,060
of we need normalcy,

761
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,150
decides to come into the office, portrays himself

762
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,070
as a quote unquote "transitional president."

763
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,760
Slowly, you know, begins to lose a lot of his faculties

764
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,520
and then surrounds himself with sycophants,

765
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,710
the same ones who have been around him for so long,

766
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,130
that he had no single input into his life to tell him

767
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:40,620
that he needed to stop and he needed to drop out of the race

768
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,160
until it became truly undeniable to the vast majority

769
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,810
of the American people.

770
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,580
And that's why I'm trying to keep it

771
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,680
as like him as an individual, as a president,

772
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,513
'cause we could separate him

773
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:51,900
from some of his accomplishments

774
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,130
and the things that happened on,

775
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,780
some I support, some I don't.

776
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,610
But generally a lot of people are not gonna look back

777
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,260
and think about Joe Biden and the CHIPS Act.

778
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,640
A lot of people are not gonna look back

779
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,100
and think about Joe Biden and the Build Back Better Bill

780
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,310
or whatever his Lina Khan Antitrust policy.

781
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,480
They're going to look back on him

782
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,310
and they're going to remember high inflation.

783
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:10,260
They're going to remember somebody

784
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,110
who fundamentally never was up to the job

785
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,690
in the sense that, one of, again,

786
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,160
book recommendation, "Freedom from Fear,"

787
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,640
by David Kennedy is about the Roosevelt years.

788
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,230
And one of the most important things

789
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,380
people don't understand is the New Deal didn't really work

790
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,840
in the way that a lot of people wanted it to, right?

791
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,700
Like there was still high unemployment,

792
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,860
there was still a lot of suffering,

793
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,090
but you know what changed?

794
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,760
They felt that they had a vigorous commander-in-chief

795
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,090
who was doing everything in his power to attack the problems

796
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,260
of the everyday American.

797
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,420
So even though things didn't even materially change

798
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,330
the vigor, that's a term that was often associated

799
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:47,338
with John F. Kennedy at vigah,

800
00:30:47,338 --> 00:30:49,170
you know, in the Massachusetts accent.

801
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,750
We had this young vibrant president in 1960

802
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,193
and he was running around and he wanted to convince us

803
00:30:53,193 --> 00:30:56,100
that he was working every single day tirelessly.

804
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,440
And when you have an 80-year-old man

805
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,000
who is simply just eating ice cream

806
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,270
and going to the beach while people's grocery prices

807
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,980
and all this thing go up by 25%

808
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,690
and we don't see the same vigor,

809
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,690
we don't see the same action, the bias to action,

810
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,330
which is so important in the modern presidency,

811
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,970
that is fundamentally why I think the Democrats

812
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,160
part of the reason why the Democrats lost the election

813
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,680
and also why I think that he missed his moment

814
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,540
in such a dramatic way.

815
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,670
And he had the opportunity, he could have done it,

816
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,160
you know, if he wanted to, but maybe 20 years ago,

817
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,650
but the truth is that his own narcissism,

818
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,590
his own misplaced belief in himself

819
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,120
and his own accidental rise

820
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,480
to the presidency ended up in his downfall.

821
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,890
And it's kind of amazing

822
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,440
because again, if we look back

823
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,810
to his original campaign speech 2019,

824
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,790
why I'm running for president, it was Charlottesville.

825
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,770
And he said, "I want to defeat Donald Trump forever

826
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,600
and I wanna make sure that he never gets back

827
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,650
in the White House again."

828
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,090
So by his own metric, he did fail.

829
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,121
That was his, it was the only thing he wanted to do.

830
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,450
And he failed them, he failed from.

831
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,650
- You said a lot of interesting stuff.

832
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,310
- Yeah. - So one FDR

833
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,340
that's really interesting.

834
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,620
It's not about the specific policy,

835
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,507
it's about like fighting for the people

836
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,430
and doing that with charisma

837
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,823
and just uniting the entire country for a,

838
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,940
this is the same with Bernie. - Yeah.

839
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,260
- Like maybe there's a lot of people

840
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,190
that disagree with Bernie

841
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,540
that still supporting him 'cause like,

842
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,800
we just want somebody- - He feels authentic.

843
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,700
- Yeah. - That's it.

844
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,950
- We just want somebody to fight authentically

845
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,783
for us. - Yes.

846
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:23,460
Yes, FDR, people really need, FDR was like a king.

847
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:26,070
He was like Jesus Christ, okay, in the U.S.

848
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,560
and some of it was because of what he did,

849
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,790
but it was just the fight.

850
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,810
So people need to go back

851
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,300
and read the history of the first 100 days under FDR,

852
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,160
the sheer amount of legislation that went through,

853
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,890
his ability to bring Congress to heel and the Senate.

854
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,180
He gets all this stuff through.

855
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,050
But as you and I know,

856
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,300
legislation takes a long time to put into place, right?

857
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,890
We've had people starving on the streets

858
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,000
all throughout 1933 under Hoover.

859
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,170
The difference was Hoover was seen as this do nothing joke

860
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:54,420
who would dine nine course meals in the White House.

861
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,040
And he is a filthy rich banker.

862
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,990
FDR comes in there

863
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,450
and every single day has seen fireside chats,

864
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,010
he's passing legislation,

865
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,210
but more importantly,

866
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,490
so he tries various different programs,

867
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,930
then they get ruled unconstitutional.

868
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,010
He tries even more.

869
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,510
So what does America take away from that?

870
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,650
Every single time,

871
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,540
if he gets knocked down, he comes back fighting.

872
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,400
And that was a really part of his character

873
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,070
that he developed after he got polio.

874
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:21,420
And it was, it gave him the strength to persevere through

875
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,920
personally what he could transfer in his calm demeanor

876
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,710
and his feeling of fight that America

877
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,500
really got that spirit from him

878
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,530
and was able to climb itself out of the Great Depression.

879
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,940
He's such an inspirational figure.

880
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,773
He really is.

881
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:39,000
And people think of him for World War II

882
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,800
of course, you know, we can spend forever on that.

883
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,147
But in my opinion, the early years are not studied enough.

884
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,630
'33 to '37 is one of the most remarkable periods

885
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,463
in American history.

886
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:50,370
We were not ruled by a president.

887
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,010
We were ruled by king, by a monarch, and people liked it.

888
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,010
He was a dictator and he was a good one.

889
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,980
- Yeah, so to sort of push back against the implied thing

890
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,843
that you said.

891
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:03,676
- Sure. - So when saying

892
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:04,860
Biden is the worst president-

893
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,270
- No second worst in modern history,

894
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,103
that's what I said.

895
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:07,936
Second- - In modern history.

896
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:08,768
- Yeah. - Who's the worst?

897
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,750
- W. with no question.

898
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,746
- I see. Because of the horrible wars probably.

899
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:13,500
- [Saagar] I mean Iraq is just so bad.

900
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,460
- It is just mess, yeah. - Like a,

901
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,219
One of my favorite authors is a guy, Jean Edward Smith.

902
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,290
He's ruined a bunch of presidential biographies

903
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,290
and in the opening of his W biography, he's like,

904
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,190
there's just no question

905
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,080
this is a single worst foreign policy mistake

906
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,210
in all of American history.

907
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,670
And W is one of our worst presidents ever.

908
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,310
He had terrible judgment and got us into a war

909
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,420
of his own choosing.

910
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,570
It was a disaster and it set us up for failure.

911
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,190
By the way, we talked a lot about Donald Trump.

912
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,199
Nobody is more responsible for the rise

913
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,550
of Donald Trump than George W. Bush.

914
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,429
But I could go off on Bush for a long time.

915
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:45,263
Oh we will. - Yeah.

916
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,096
- We will return there. - Yeah.

917
00:34:46,096 --> 00:34:47,940
Yeah. - So as part of the pushback

918
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,820
I'd like to say 'cause I agree with your criticism

919
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,610
of arrogance and narcissism against Joe Biden.

920
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:56,034
The same could be said about Donald Trump.

921
00:34:56,034 --> 00:34:57,001
- You're absolutely right. - Of arrogance.

922
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:57,834
- Yeah. - So,

923
00:34:57,834 --> 00:35:00,600
and I think you've also articulated that a lot of presidents

924
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,450
throughout American history have suffered

925
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,760
from a bad case of arrogance and narcissism.

926
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,590
- Absolutely, but sometimes fewer benefit,

927
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,750
you know, you have to be a pretty crazy person to be,

928
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,160
to wanna be president.

929
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,600
I, you know, I had put out a tweet

930
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,800
that got some controversy,

931
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,310
and I think it was Joe Rogan who I love,

932
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,480
but he was like, "I wanna find out

933
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,107
who Kamala Harris is as a human being."

934
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:22,050
And I was like, I'm actually not interested

935
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,860
in who politicians are as human beings at all.

936
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,210
I was like, I've read too much about them to know,

937
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,590
I know who you are.

938
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,910
If you spend your life

939
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,110
and because I live in Washington

940
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,840
and I spend a lot of time around would be politicians,

941
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,000
I know what it takes to actually become the president.

942
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,833
It's crazy.

943
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:38,790
You have to give up everything,

944
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,810
everything.

945
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,060
Every night, you're not spending it with your wife.

946
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,040
You're spending it at dinner with potential donors,

947
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,500
with friends, with people who can connect you every,

948
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,790
even after you get elected,

949
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,620
that's even more so, now you got to raise money

950
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,970
and now you're onto the next thing.

951
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,680
Now you wanna get your political thing through,

952
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,150
you're gonna spend all your time on your phone.

953
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,370
You and your staff are gonna be more like this.

954
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,590
Your entire life revolves around your career.

955
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,560
It's honestly, you need an insane level of narcissism

956
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,243
to do it because you have to believe

957
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:05,670
that you are better than everybody else,

958
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,710
which is already pretty crazy.

959
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,850
And not only that, your own personal characteristics

960
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,600
and foibles lead you to the pursuit of this office

961
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,570
and to the pursuit of the idolatry of the self

962
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,010
and everything around you.

963
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,839
There's a famous story of Lady Bird Johnson

964
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:24,540
after Johnson becomes the president

965
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,890
and he's talking to the White House butler.

966
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,810
And she was like, "Everything in this house revolves

967
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,830
around my husband.

968
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,387
Whatever's left goes to the girls," her two children,

969
00:36:31,387 --> 00:36:32,910
"and I'll take the scraps."

970
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,520
So everything revolved

971
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,020
around Johnson's political career

972
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,730
and his daughters, when they're honest,

973
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,890
'cause they like to paper over some of the things

974
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,790
that happened under him,

975
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,479
but they didn't spend any time with him.

976
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:46,530
Saturday morning was for breakfast with, you know,

977
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,850
Richard Russell, I forget,

978
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,740
these are all in the Robert A. Caro books.

979
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,690
Sunday was for Rayburn.

980
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,080
There was no time for, you know, for his kids.

981
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,913
That's what it was.

982
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,930
And by the way, he's one of the greatest politicians

983
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,830
to ever live,

984
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,230
but he also died from a massive heart attack.

985
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,360
And he was a deeply sad and depressed individual.

986
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,730
- Yeah, I saw that tweet to go back to that.

987
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,980
- Yeah. - And also I listened

988
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,540
to your incredible debate about it

989
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,803
with Marshall on "The Realignment" podcast.

990
00:37:11,803 --> 00:37:13,590
And I have to side with Marshall.

991
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,550
- Okay. - I think you're just wrong

992
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,413
on this. - All right.

993
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:18,120
- Because I think revealing the character

994
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,920
of a person is really important to understand

995
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,410
how they will act in a room full of generals

996
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,940
and full of- - Yeah.

997
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,170
This gets to the judgment question.

998
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,070
- The judgment. - And that's,

999
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,680
I think of Johnson and of Nixon,

1000
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,410
of Teddy Roosevelt, even of FDR,

1001
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,590
I can give you a laundry list of personal problems

1002
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,850
that all those people had.

1003
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,800
I think they had a really, really good judgment.

1004
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,420
And I'm not sure

1005
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,570
how intrinsic their own personal character was

1006
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,930
to their exploration and thinking about the world.

1007
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,660
So JFK is actually, JFK might be our best example

1008
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,080
because he had the best judgment out of anybody in a room

1009
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
as a brand new president in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

1010
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,510
And he got us out and avoided nuclear war,

1011
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,640
which he deserves eternal credit for that.

1012
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,751
But how did he arrive to good judgment?

1013
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,250
Some of it certainly was his character.

1014
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,920
And we can go again though into his laundry list of that.

1015
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,310
But most of it was around being with his father,

1016
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,530
seeing some of the mistakes that he would make.

1017
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,080
And he was also had a deeply inquisitive mind

1018
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,720
and he experienced World War II

1019
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,910
at the personal level after PT-109.

1020
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,890
So it is, look, I get it.

1021
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,260
I actually could steel man and I could,

1022
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,320
the response to what I'm saying is judgment is not divisible

1023
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,640
from personal character.

1024
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,340
But just because I know a lot of politicians,

1025
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,837
and I've read enough with the really great ones,

1026
00:38:33,837 --> 00:38:37,173
the people who I revere the most.

1027
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,720
There's really bad personal stuff

1028
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,370
basically every single time.

1029
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,527
- But you're saying the judgment was good.

1030
00:38:43,527 --> 00:38:44,910
- His judgment was great.

1031
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,050
His judgment was great. - On through a missile crisis.

1032
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,710
- Yes. - Some of the best judgment

1033
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,930
and decision-making in the history of America.

1034
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,430
- Yes, and we should study a lot of it.

1035
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,440
And I encourage people out there,

1036
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,210
this is a brutal text.

1037
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,550
We were forced to read it in graduate school,

1038
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,650
the "Essence of Decision" by Graham Allison.

1039
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,000
I'm so thankful we did.

1040
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,520
It's one of the foundations of political science

1041
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,220
because it lays out theories of how government works.

1042
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,870
This is also a useful transition, by the way,

1043
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,660
if we want to talk about Trump and some of his cabinet

1044
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,280
and how bad it's shaping up

1045
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,760
because people really need to understand Washington.

1046
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,670
Washington is a creature with traditions,

1047
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,520
with institutions that don't care about you.

1048
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,440
They don't even really care about the president.

1049
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,450
They have self-perpetuating mechanisms

1050
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,220
which have been done a certain way.

1051
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,650
And it usually takes a great shocking event

1052
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,500
like World War II to change really anything

1053
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,850
beyond the marginal.

1054
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,070
Every once in a while you have a figure like Teddy Roosevelt

1055
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,110
who's actually able to take peacetime presidency

1056
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,250
and transform the country.

1057
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,870
But it needs an extraordinary individual

1058
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,040
to get something like that done.

1059
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,470
So the question around the essence

1060
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,530
of decision was the theory behind the Cuban Missile Crisis

1061
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:52,980
of how Kennedy arrived at his decision.

1062
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,990
And there are various different schools of thought,

1063
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:57,000
but one of the things I love about the book is it presents

1064
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,760
a case for all three, the organizational theory,

1065
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,410
the bureaucratic politics theory,

1066
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,690
and then kind of the great man theory as well.

1067
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,280
So there's a, you know, you and I could sit here

1068
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,430
and I could tell you a case about PT-109

1069
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,670
and about how John F. Kennedy experienced World War II

1070
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,860
as this, I think he was like a first lieutenant

1071
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,693
or something like that.

1072
00:40:14,693 --> 00:40:17,190
And how he literally swam miles

1073
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,580
with a wounded man's life jacket strap in his teeth

1074
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,197
with a broken back and he saved him.

1075
00:40:22,197 --> 00:40:24,060
And he ended up on the cover of Life Magazine.

1076
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,140
And he was a war hero.

1077
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,390
And he was a deeply smart individual

1078
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,990
who wrote a book in 1939 called "Why England Slept,"

1079
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,040
which to this day is considered a text,

1080
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,580
which at the moment was able to describe in detail

1081
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,410
why Neville Chamberlain

1082
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,480
and the British political system arrived

1083
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,440
at the policy of appeasement.

1084
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,300
I actually have a original copy,

1085
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,400
it's one of my most prized possessions because,

1086
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,340
and from 1939, because this is a 23-year-old kid,

1087
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,440
who the fuck are you, John F. Kennedy?

1088
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,880
Turns out he's a brilliant man.

1089
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,310
And another just favorite aside is that

1090
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,690
at the Potsdam Conference,

1091
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,860
you know, where Harry Truman is there

1092
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,150
with Stalin and everybody.

1093
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,550
So in the room at the same time, Harry S. Truman,

1094
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,630
president of the United States,

1095
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,150
Dwight D. Eisenhower, the general, right,

1096
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,320
who will succeed him,

1097
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,800
26-year-old John F. Kennedy as a journalist,

1098
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,750
some shithead journalist on the side,

1099
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,300
and all three of those presidents were in the same room

1100
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,950
with Joseph Stalin and others.

1101
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,530
And that's the story of America right there.

1102
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,637
It's kind of amazing.

1103
00:41:20,637 --> 00:41:23,400
And I loved people to say that because you never know

1104
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,680
about who will end up rising to power.

1105
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,580
But- - Are you announcing

1106
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,230
that you're running for- - No, absolutely not.

1107
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,260
Yeah, yeah.

1108
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,093
- Okay. - I don't have what it takes.

1109
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:31,860
I don't think so, I'm self-aware.

1110
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,440
- Yeah, well, maybe humility necessary for greatness.

1111
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,740
Okay, so yeah, actually, can we just linger on that book?

1112
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,337
- Yeah. - So the book,

1113
00:41:39,337 --> 00:41:42,870
"Essence of Decision: Explaining the Cuban Missile Crisis,"

1114
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:44,430
by Graham Allison,

1115
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,440
it presents three different models

1116
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,090
of how government works.

1117
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,350
The Rational Actor Model,

1118
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,513
so seeing government as one entity,

1119
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,290
trying to maximize the national interest,

1120
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:59,730
also seeing government as through the lens of the momentum

1121
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,020
of standard operating procedures,

1122
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:05,760
sort of this giant organization that's just doing things,

1123
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,830
how it's always been done,

1124
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,680
and the government politics model of

1125
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,190
there's just these individual internal

1126
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,873
power struggles within government.

1127
00:42:15,873 --> 00:42:17,760
- Yes. - And all of that is like

1128
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,650
a different way to view,

1129
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,290
and they're probably all true to a degree

1130
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,153
of how decisions are made.

1131
00:42:24,153 --> 00:42:25,590
- Yes. - Within this giant

1132
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,520
machinery of government.

1133
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,360
- That's why it's so important

1134
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,220
is because you cannot read that book and say

1135
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,390
one is true and one is not.

1136
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,400
You can say one is may more true than the other,

1137
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,050
but all of them are deeply true.

1138
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:36,150
And this is one or this is probably a good transition

1139
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,127
to Donald Trump because,

1140
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:39,577
and I guess for the people out there

1141
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:41,400
who think I've been up too obsequious,

1142
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,660
he'll be my criticism,

1143
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,010
Trump says something very fundamental

1144
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,600
and interesting on the Joe Rogan podcast,

1145
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,700
probably the most important thing that he ever said,

1146
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,030
which is he said, "I like to have people like John Bolton

1147
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,410
in my administration.

1148
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,150
Well, because they scare people

1149
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,580
and it makes me seem like the most rational individual

1150
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,413
in the room."

1151
00:42:57,413 --> 00:42:59,700
So at a very intuitive level,

1152
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,230
a lot of people can understand that.

1153
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,690
And then they can rationalize while there are picks

1154
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,760
that Donald Trump has brought into his White House,

1155
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,120
people like Mike Waltz and others that have espoused views

1156
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,050
that are directly at odds with a quote unquote "anti-neocon

1157
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,120
anti-Liz Cheney agenda."

1158
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,700
Now, Trump's theory of this is that

1159
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,310
he likes to have quote unquote "like psychopaths"

1160
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,950
like John Bolton in the room with him

1161
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,020
while he's sitting across from Kim Jong Un,

1162
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,400
because it gets scared.

1163
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,317
What I think Trump never understood when he was president,

1164
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:30,510
and I honestly question if he still does now,

1165
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,970
is those two theories that you laid out,

1166
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,680
which are not about the rational interest

1167
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,940
as the government is one model,

1168
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,440
but the bureaucratic theory

1169
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,390
and the organizational theory of politics.

1170
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,690
And because what Trump I don't think quite gets is that

1171
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:46,050
there are 99% of the decisions that get made in government

1172
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,730
never reach the president's desk.

1173
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,237
One of the most important Obama quotes ever is,

1174
00:43:49,237 --> 00:43:51,652
"By the time it gets to my desk, nobody else can solve it.

1175
00:43:51,652 --> 00:43:53,400
All the problems here are hard.

1176
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,020
All the problems here don't have an answer.

1177
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,580
That's why I have to make the call."

1178
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,463
So the theory that Trump has,

1179
00:43:59,463 --> 00:44:01,170
that you can have people in there who are,

1180
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,060
let's say war mongers, neocons or whatever,

1181
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,280
who don't necessarily agree with you is that

1182
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,770
when push comes to shove at the most important decisions,

1183
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,010
that I'll still be able to reign those people in

1184
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,220
as an influence.

1185
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,720
Here's the issue.

1186
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,040
Let's say for Mike Waltz,

1187
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,807
who's gonna be the national security advisor,

1188
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:18,210
a lot of people don't really understand, you know,

1189
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,160
there's this theory of national security advisor

1190
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,590
where you call me into your office and you're the president

1191
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,060
you're like, "Hey, what do we think about Iran?"

1192
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,440
And I'm like, "I think you should do X, Y, and Z."

1193
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,490
No, that's not how it works.

1194
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,710
The national security advisor's job is to coordinate

1195
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,030
the inter-agency process.

1196
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,300
So his job is actually convene meetings, him and his staff,

1197
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,390
where in the situation room CIA, State Department,

1198
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,030
Sec Def, others before the POTUS even walks in,

1199
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,050
we have options.

1200
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,900
So we're like, "Hey, Russia just invaded Ukraine,

1201
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,970
weed a package of options

1202
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,430
Those packages options are gonna concede of three things.

1203
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,270
We're gonna have one group,

1204
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,740
we're gonna call it the dovish option,

1205
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,360
two, we're gonna call it the middle ground,

1206
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,160
three, the hardcore package."

1207
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,290
Trump walks in, this is how it's supposed to work.

1208
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:57,930
Trump walks in and he goes, "Okay, Russia invaded Ukraine.

1209
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:58,763
What do we do?"

1210
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,570
"Mr. President, we've prepared three options for you.

1211
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:01,860
We've got one, two, and three."

1212
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:02,970
Now who has the power?

1213
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:04,710
Is it Trump when he picks one, two, or three?

1214
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,810
Or is the man who decides what's even in option

1215
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,550
one, two, and three?

1216
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,610
That is the part where Trump needs to really understand

1217
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,960
how these things happen.

1218
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,793
And I watched this happen to him

1219
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:15,930
in his first administration.

1220
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,520
He hired a guy, Mike Flynn,

1221
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,200
who was his national security advisor.

1222
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,190
You could say a lot about Flynn,

1223
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,400
but him and Trump were at least like this on foreign policy.

1224
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,630
Flynn gets outed

1225
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:28,350
because what I would call an FBI coup, whatever, 33 days,

1226
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,690
he's out as a national security advisor.

1227
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,800
H.R. McMaster, he's got a nice, shiny uniform,

1228
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,900
four star, all of this,

1229
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,457
Master doesn't agree with Donald Trump at all.

1230
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:41,670
And so Trump says, "I ran on pulling out of Afghanistan,

1231
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:42,780
I want to get out of Afghanistan."

1232
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,250
They're like, "Yeah, we'll get out Afghanistan,

1233
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:46,320
but before we get out we got to go back in

1234
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,790
as we need more troops in there."

1235
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,620
And he is like, "oh, okay."

1236
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,050
You know, it's like all this and yeah, approves a plan

1237
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,930
and effectively gives a speech in 2017

1238
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,180
where he ends up escalating

1239
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,220
and increasing the number of troops in Afghanistan.

1240
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,843
And it's only till February 2020

1241
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:03,480
that he gets to sign a deal, the Taliban peace deal.

1242
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,450
Which in my opinion, you should have done in 2017.

1243
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,790
But the reason why that happened was because of that

1244
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:11,550
organizational theory, of that bureaucratic politics theory

1245
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,010
where H.R. McMaster is able to guide

1246
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,360
the interagency process,

1247
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,580
bring the uniform recommendations

1248
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,920
of the joint chiefs of staff and others to give Donald Trump

1249
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,560
no option but to say we must put troops.

1250
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,517
Another example of this is a book called

1251
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:26,130
"Obama's War" by Bob Woodward.

1252
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,720
I highly encourage people to read this book

1253
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,310
because this book talks about

1254
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,407
how Obama comes into the White House in 2009

1255
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:33,210
and he says, "I wanna get out of Iraq

1256
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,380
and I don't wanna increase,

1257
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,260
I wanna fight the Good War in Afghanistan," right?

1258
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,990
And he's doing, Obama's a thoughtful guy

1259
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,340
too thoughtful actually.

1260
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,070
And so he sits there and he's working out his opinions.

1261
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:48,810
And what he starts to watch is that very slowly his narrow,

1262
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,580
his options begin to narrow

1263
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,160
because strategic leaks start to come out

1264
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,960
from the White House situation room

1265
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,490
about what we should do in Afghanistan.

1266
00:46:56,490 --> 00:47:00,030
And pretty soon David Petraeus and Stan McChrystal

1267
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:03,810
and the entire national security apparatus has Obama pegged

1268
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,170
where he basically politically at the time decides

1269
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:10,110
to take the advantage position

1270
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,820
of increasing troops in Afghanistan,

1271
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,987
but then tries to have it both ways, but by saying,

1272
00:47:13,987 --> 00:47:15,810
"but in two years, we're gonna withdraw."

1273
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,910
That book really demonstrates

1274
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,210
how the deep state can completely remove

1275
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:25,230
any of your options to be able to move by presenting you

1276
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:27,840
with ones which you don't even want,

1277
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,930
and then making it politically completely infeasible

1278
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,300
to travel down the extreme directions.

1279
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,507
That's why when Trump says things like,

1280
00:47:34,507 --> 00:47:35,940
"I wanna get out of Syria,"

1281
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,490
that doesn't compute up here for the Pentagon,

1282
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,840
because first of all, you know,

1283
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,760
if I even asked you how many troops we have in Syria,

1284
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,170
and you could go on the DOD website,

1285
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,003
it'll tell you a number.

1286
00:47:44,003 --> 00:47:44,836
The number's bullshit,

1287
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:46,200
because the way that they do it is

1288
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,060
if you're only there for 179 days,

1289
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,310
you don't count as active military contracts.

1290
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:51,900
The real numbers, let's say five times.

1291
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,178
And so Trump would be like, "Hey, I wanna get out of Syria."

1292
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:55,440
They're like, "Yeah, yeah, we'll do it six months," right?

1293
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,300
We need six months and after six months ago,

1294
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,800
so are we out of Syria yet?

1295
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,600
And they're like, "No, well we got to wrap this up.

1296
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,910
We got this base, we got that,

1297
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:02,850
and we have this important mission."

1298
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,900
And you know, next thing you know,

1299
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,550
you're out of office and it's over.

1300
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,650
So that, there's all these things

1301
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,960
which I don't think he quite understands.

1302
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,850
I know that some of the people around him who disagree

1303
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,310
with these picks do is the reason why these picks

1304
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,170
really matter is not only are the voices

1305
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,003
in the situation room

1306
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:18,690
for the really, really high profile stuff,

1307
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:19,830
it's for all the little things

1308
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,480
to never get to that president's desk

1309
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,610
of which can shape extraordinary policy.

1310
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,640
And I'll give you the best example.

1311
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,087
There was never a decision by FDR as president

1312
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:32,490
of the United States to oil embargo Japan.

1313
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,230
One, which he thought about

1314
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:35,790
as deeply as you and I would want.

1315
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,040
It was a decision kind of made within the State Department.

1316
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,680
It was a decision that was made by some of his advisors.

1317
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,390
I think he eventually signed off on it.

1318
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,260
It was a conscious choice,

1319
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:46,140
but it was not one whichever was understood

1320
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,210
the implications that by doing that

1321
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,730
we invite a potential response like Pearl Harbor.

1322
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,990
So think about, you know,

1323
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,050
what the organizational bureaucratic model can tell us

1324
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,360
about the extraordinary blowback that we can get

1325
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,060
and why we want people with great judgment

1326
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,670
all the way up and down the entire national security chain

1327
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,840
in the White House.

1328
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,750
Also, I just realized I did not talk about immigration,

1329
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:07,980
which is so insane.

1330
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,380
One of the reasons Donald Trump won in 2024,

1331
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,410
of course was because of the massive change

1332
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,190
to the immigration status quo.

1333
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,700
The truth is, is that it may actually be second to inflation

1334
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,680
in terms of the reason that Trump did win

1335
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,560
the presidency was because Joe Biden fundamentally changed

1336
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,390
the immigration status quo in this country.

1337
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,700
That was another thing about the Scots-Irish people

1338
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,710
and others that we need to understand is that

1339
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,900
when government machinery and elitism

1340
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,230
and liberalism appears to be more concerned

1341
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:36,660
about people who are coming here in a disorderly

1342
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,120
and illegal process and about their rights

1343
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,140
and their, you know,

1344
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,810
ability to quote unquote "pursue the American dream,"

1345
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:44,640
while the American dream is dying

1346
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,290
for the native-born population,

1347
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:49,140
that is a huge reason why people are turning

1348
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,670
against mass immigration.

1349
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:52,200
Historically as well,

1350
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,427
my friend Reihan Salam wrote a book called

1351
00:49:54,427 --> 00:49:56,190
"Melting Pot or Civil War"

1352
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,410
and one of the most important parts

1353
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,870
about that book is the history

1354
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,830
of mass migration to the United States.

1355
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:04,260
So if we think about the transition

1356
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,050
from Scots-Irish America to the opening

1357
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,727
of America to the Irish

1358
00:50:08,727 --> 00:50:11,073
and to mass European immigration,

1359
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,520
what a lot of people don't realize is it caused

1360
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,750
a ton of problems.

1361
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,730
There were mass movements at that time,

1362
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,950
the Know-Nothings and others in the 1860s

1363
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,950
who rose up against mass European migration,

1364
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:26,280
they were particularly concerned about Catholicism by,

1365
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,830
as the religion of a lot of the new immigrants.

1366
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:31,110
But really what it was is about the changing

1367
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:33,360
of the American character by people

1368
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,700
who are not have the same traditions,

1369
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,670
values and skills as the native-born population

1370
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,680
and their understanding of what they're owed

1371
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,080
and their role in American society is very different

1372
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,750
from the way that people previously had.

1373
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,130
One of the most tumultuous periods

1374
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,580
of U.S. politics was actually during the resolution

1375
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,050
of the immigration question,

1376
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,560
where we had massive waves of foreign-born population

1377
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,330
come to the United States.

1378
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:00,300
We had them, you know, integrated,

1379
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,040
luckily, actually at the time

1380
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,170
with the Industrial Revolution.

1381
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:06,000
So we actually did have jobs for them.

1382
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,970
One of the problems is that today in the United States

1383
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:10,470
we have one of the highest levels

1384
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,450
of foreign-born population than ever before,

1385
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:15,750
actually since that time in the early 1900s,

1386
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,300
but we have all of the same attendant problems.

1387
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,460
But even worse is we don't live

1388
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,230
in an industrial economy anymore.

1389
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,960
We live in a predominantly service-based economy

1390
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,240
that has long, you know, moved past manufacturing.

1391
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,460
Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't bring some of that back,

1392
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,710
but the truth is, is that manufacturing today is not

1393
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:34,620
what it was to work in a steel mill in 1875.

1394
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,350
I think we can all be reasonable and we can agree on that.

1395
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,080
And part of the problems with extremely high levels

1396
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,230
of foreign-born population, particularly unskilled,

1397
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,990
and the vast majority of the people who are coming here

1398
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,880
and who are claiming asylum are doing so

1399
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,350
under fraudulent purposes.

1400
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,900
They're doing so because they are economic migrants

1401
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,150
and they're abusing, you know, asylum law

1402
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,190
to basically gain entrance to the United States

1403
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,000
without going through a process of application or of merit.

1404
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,320
And this has, its all of its traces back to 1965

1405
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,271
where the Immigration Naturalization Act of 1965

1406
00:52:07,271 --> 00:52:11,010
really reversed and changed the status quo of immigration

1407
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:15,870
from the 1920s to 1960, which really shut down

1408
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,790
levels of immigration to the United States.

1409
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:19,650
In my opinion, it was one of the most important things

1410
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,520
that ever happened

1411
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,190
and one of the reasons why is it forced

1412
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:24,690
and caused integration.

1413
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:28,020
It also forced by slowing down the increase

1414
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,940
in the number of foreign-born population,

1415
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,580
it redeveloped an American character

1416
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:35,100
and an understanding that was more homogenous

1417
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,020
and was the ability for you and me to understand

1418
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,090
despite the difference in our background.

1419
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:41,520
If you accelerate and you continue this trend

1420
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,580
of the very high foreign-born unskilled population,

1421
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:48,123
you unfortunately are basically creating a mass, you know,

1422
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,690
it's basically it's a non-citizen population

1423
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,800
of illegal immigrants.

1424
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,190
People who are not a skilled, you know, I think it was,

1425
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,590
I read 27% of the people who've come

1426
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:02,280
under Joe Biden illegally don't even have a college degree.

1427
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,480
That means that we are lucky

1428
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,600
if they're even literate in Spanish, let alone English.

1429
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,760
So there are major problems about integrating

1430
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,593
that type of person.

1431
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:11,820
You know, even in the past,

1432
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,950
whenever we had a mass industrial economy,

1433
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:16,650
now imagine today the amount of strain

1434
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,330
that would put on social services

1435
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,610
if mass citizenship happened, you know,

1436
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,430
to that population would be extraordinary.

1437
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:25,740
And even if we were to do, I don't think it's a good idea,

1438
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:28,410
but even if we were to do so,

1439
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:30,840
we would still need to pair it with a dramatic change.

1440
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,030
And part of the problem right now is

1441
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,047
I don't think a lot of people understand

1442
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,730
the immigration system.

1443
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:37,380
The immigration system in the United States,

1444
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,650
effectively they call it family-based migration.

1445
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,399
I call it chain migration.

1446
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:46,710
Chain migration is the term which implies that

1447
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:48,180
let's say you come over here

1448
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,890
and you get your green card,

1449
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:52,200
you can use sponsorship and others by gaming

1450
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,390
the quota system to get your cousin

1451
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:55,980
or whatever to be able to come.

1452
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,660
The problem with that is who is your cousin?

1453
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,680
Like is he a plumber?

1454
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,690
Is he, you know, is he a coder?

1455
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:01,770
You know, that doesn't actually matter

1456
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,780
'cause he's your cousin so he actually has preference.

1457
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,970
The way that it should work is it should be,

1458
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,770
nobody cares if he's your cousin.

1459
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:08,610
What does he do?

1460
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,290
You know, what does she do?

1461
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,820
What is she gonna bring to this country?

1462
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,650
All immigration in the United States, in my opinion,

1463
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,530
should be net positive without doing fake statistics about,

1464
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,450
oh, they actually increased the GDP or whatever.

1465
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,120
It's like we need a merit-based immigration system.

1466
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,000
We are the largest country in the world

1467
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,890
and one of the only non-Western

1468
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,420
or one of the only Western countries in the world

1469
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,770
that does not have a merit-based

1470
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,500
points-based immigration system like Australia

1471
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,580
and or Canada.

1472
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:35,190
And I mean, I get it because a lot of people did come

1473
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,410
to this country under non-merit-based purposes.

1474
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,750
So they're really reluctant to let that go.

1475
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,100
But I do think that Biden,

1476
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,960
by changing the immigration status quo

1477
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,620
and by basically just allowing, you know, tens of millions,

1478
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,230
potentially tens of millions at the very least 12 million,

1479
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:53,400
new entrants to come to the U.S. under these pretenses

1480
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,090
of complete disorder and of no conduct

1481
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:00,510
really broke a lot of people's understanding

1482
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:03,240
and even like mercy in that regard.

1483
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,880
And so that was obviously a massive part of Trump's victory.

1484
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,850
- Speaking of illegal immigration,

1485
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:11,640
what do you think about the border are Tom Homan?

1486
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,500
- Tom Holman is a very legit dude,

1487
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,333
got to know him a little bit

1488
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:18,960
in Trump 1.0, he is an original,

1489
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,960
like true believer on enforcing immigration law as it is.

1490
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,430
Now notice how I just said it that,

1491
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,095
that's a politically correct way of saying mass deportation.

1492
00:55:30,095 --> 00:55:33,450
And I will point out from my left-wing critics in that,

1493
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,843
yeah, he really believes in the ability,

1494
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:42,180
in the ability, in the necessity of mass deportation.

1495
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,370
And he has the background to be able to carry that out.

1496
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,880
I will give some warnings and this will apply to DOGE too.

1497
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,230
Czar has no statutory or constitutional authority.

1498
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,810
Czar has as much authority as the president

1499
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,280
of the United States gives him.

1500
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,160
Donald Trump, I think it's fair to say even his critics

1501
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,540
or even the people who love him could say

1502
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,970
he can be capricious at times

1503
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:05,220
and he can strip you or not strip you

1504
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,260
or give you the ability to compel.

1505
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,920
So Czar in and of itself is frankly a very flawed position

1506
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,850
in the White House

1507
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,520
and it's one that I really wish we would move away from.

1508
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,810
I understand why we do it.

1509
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,740
It's basically to do a national security advisor

1510
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,290
interagency convener to accomplish certain goals.

1511
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:24,810
That said, there is a person, Steven Miller,

1512
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:25,680
who will be in the White House,

1513
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,300
the Deputy White House Chief of Staff

1514
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,470
who has well-founded beliefs experience in government

1515
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,910
and rock solid ideology on this,

1516
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,300
which I think would also give him the ability

1517
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,250
to work with home and to pull that off.

1518
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:40,950
That said, a corollary to this,

1519
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:44,400
and frankly this is the one I'm the most mystified yet,

1520
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,590
is Kristi Noem,

1521
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:49,170
as the Department of Homeland Security Secretary.

1522
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,360
So let me just lay this out for people

1523
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,590
'cause people don't know what this is.

1524
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,897
Department of Homeland Security, 90% of the time,

1525
00:56:54,897 --> 00:56:56,820
the way you're gonna interact with them is TSA,

1526
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:59,430
you don't think about it, but people don't know,

1527
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:00,915
the Department of Homeland Security is one

1528
00:57:00,915 --> 00:57:03,480
of the largest law enforcement if maybe the largest

1529
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,400
law enforcement agency in the world.

1530
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,570
It's gigantic.

1531
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,150
You have extraordinary statutory power

1532
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:12,090
to be able to prove investigations,

1533
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,240
you have border patrol, ICE, TSA, CBP,

1534
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,700
all these other agencies that report up to you.

1535
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:21,120
But most importantly for this, you will be the public face

1536
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,800
of mass deportation.

1537
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,870
So I was there in the White House briefing room

1538
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,580
last time around when Kirstjen Nielsen,

1539
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,100
who was the DHS secretary under Donald Trump,

1540
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,410
and specifically the one who enforced child separation

1541
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:33,990
for a limited period of time.

1542
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:36,030
She was a smart woman.

1543
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:38,340
She has long experience in government

1544
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,910
and honestly she melted under the criticism.

1545
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:44,340
Kristi Noem is the governor of South Dakota.

1546
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,173
I mean, that's great,

1547
00:57:45,173 --> 00:57:46,680
you have a little bit of executive experience,

1548
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,513
but to be honest,

1549
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:49,740
I mean you have no law enforcement background.

1550
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,810
You have no ability to,

1551
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:54,420
you have no frankly with understanding

1552
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,690
of what it is going to be like to be the secretary

1553
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:59,850
of one of the most controversial programs

1554
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,320
in modern American history.

1555
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,730
You have to go on television

1556
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,040
and defend that every single day.

1557
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,170
A literal job requirement under Donald Trump.

1558
00:58:07,170 --> 00:58:09,000
And you will have to have.

1559
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,830
extraordinary command of the facts.

1560
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,720
You have to have a very high intellect.

1561
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,540
You have to have the ability to really break through.

1562
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,210
And I mean, we all watch how she handled that situation

1563
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:20,040
with her dog in her interviews.

1564
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:21,840
And that does not give me confidence

1565
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,610
that she will be able to do all that well

1566
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,860
in the position so. - What do you think

1567
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,246
is behind that?

1568
00:58:26,246 --> 00:58:29,576
So crystal ball's theory on breaking points-

1569
00:58:29,576 --> 00:58:30,450
- Yeah. - Is that

1570
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,100
there's some kind of interpersonal,

1571
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,713
like I didn't know-

1572
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,590
- I can explain it. - I should know this,

1573
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,709
but I didn't know any of the-

1574
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:40,620
- Yeah. - There was some cheating

1575
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,360
or whatever. - There's a rumor nobody knows

1576
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,250
if it's true that Corey Lewandowski

1577
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,170
and Kristi Noem had a previous relationship

1578
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,290
and ongoing Corey Lewandowski is a Trump official

1579
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,750
and that he maybe put her in front, I don't know.

1580
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,715
- Is this like the Real Housewives of DC?

1581
00:58:53,715 --> 00:58:54,904
- Yeah, kind of, although,

1582
00:58:54,904 --> 00:58:56,970
I mean it was the most open secret in the world allegedly.

1583
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,252
I don't know if it's true. Okay, all right.

1584
00:58:58,252 --> 00:58:59,700
I mean, I don't like to traffic too much

1585
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,930
in personal theories,

1586
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:03,990
but I mean, in this respect it might actually be correct

1587
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,790
in terms of how it all came down.

1588
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,910
I have no idea what he's thinking to be, I truly don't.

1589
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,987
I mean, maybe it's like he was last time he said,

1590
00:59:10,987 --> 00:59:14,790
"I want a woman who's like softer and like emotionally

1591
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:18,057
and the ability to be the face of my immigration program."

1592
00:59:19,195 --> 00:59:20,820
I mean, again, like I said,

1593
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,390
I don't see it in terms of her experience and her media.

1594
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,730
It's frankly like not very good.

1595
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,010
- So you think she needs to be able to articulate,

1596
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:33,240
not just be like the softer face of this radical-

1597
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,830
- Yeah, so- - Policy, but also be able

1598
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:37,020
to articulate the what's happening with the reasoning

1599
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:37,853
behind all that? - Yes.

1600
00:59:37,853 --> 00:59:39,150
You need to give justification for everything.

1601
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,190
Here's the thing, under mass deportation,

1602
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,750
the media will drag up

1603
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:46,980
every sob story known to planet Earth about this person

1604
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,440
and that person who came here illegally

1605
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,760
and why they deserve to stay.

1606
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,230
And really what the quasi thing is,

1607
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:53,760
that's why the program itself is bad.

1608
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,800
And we should legalize everybody who's here illegally.

1609
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,740
Okay, so the thing is, is that you need to be able

1610
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,450
to have extraordinary oversight.

1611
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:01,500
You need a great team with you.

1612
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,640
You need to make sure

1613
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,590
that everything is being done by the book.

1614
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:07,140
The way that the media is being handled is that

1615
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,210
you throw every question back in their face

1616
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:12,300
and you say, well, you know, you either talk about crime

1617
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:14,610
or you talk about the enforceability of the law,

1618
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,380
then necessity, I mean I just,

1619
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,810
I think articulated a very coherent case

1620
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:21,180
for why we need much less high levels

1621
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,620
of immigration to the United States.

1622
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:26,880
And I am the son of people who immigrated to this country.

1623
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,040
But one of the favorite phrases I heard from this,

1624
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,870
from a guy named Mark Krikorian

1625
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,730
who's a center for immigration studies is

1626
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,250
we don't make immigration policy

1627
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,470
for the benefit of our grandparents.

1628
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,870
We make immigration policy for the benefit

1629
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,070
of our grandchildren.

1630
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,230
And that is an extraordinary and good way to put it.

1631
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:44,760
And in fact, I would say it's a triumph

1632
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:45,990
of the American system

1633
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,150
that somebody whose parent family benefited

1634
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,610
from the immigration regime and was able to come here.

1635
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:53,370
My parents had PhDs, came here legally,

1636
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:56,340
applied, spent thousands of dollars through the process,

1637
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,670
can arrive at the conclusion that actually we need to care

1638
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:02,430
about all of our fellow American citizens.

1639
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:03,960
I'm not talking about other Indians

1640
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,310
or you know, other whatever.

1641
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,143
I'm talking about all of us.

1642
01:01:06,143 --> 01:01:08,610
I care about everybody who is here in this country,

1643
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,710
but fundamentally, that will mean

1644
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,270
that we are going to have to exclude

1645
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:13,500
some people from the U.S.

1646
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,750
And I mean, another thing

1647
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:19,380
that the open borders people don't ever really grapple with

1648
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,840
is that even within their own framework,

1649
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,860
it makes no sense.

1650
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,240
So for example, a common left-wing talking point is that

1651
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,530
it's America's fault that El Salvador and Honduras

1652
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,030
and Central America is fucked up.

1653
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:35,400
And so because of that, we have a responsibility

1654
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,300
to take all those people in

1655
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,400
'cause it's our fault or Haiti, right?

1656
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,550
But you know, if you think about it, America is responsible,

1657
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,320
and I'm just being honest for destroying

1658
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,970
and ruining a lot of countries.

1659
01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:48,480
They just don't benefit from the geographic like ability

1660
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,250
to walk to the United States.

1661
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:52,740
So I mean, if we're doing grievance politics,

1662
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:55,500
Iraqis have way more of a claim to be able to come here

1663
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,910
than anybody from El Salvador

1664
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:59,730
who's talking about something that happened in 1982.

1665
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:03,360
So within its own logic, it doesn't make any sense.

1666
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:05,813
Even under the asylum process, you know, people,

1667
01:02:05,813 --> 01:02:07,320
I mean, people don't even know this.

1668
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,880
You're literally able to claim asylum

1669
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,803
from domestic violence, okay?

1670
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:14,490
I mean, imagine that like that's frankly,

1671
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:16,860
that is a local law enforcement

1672
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,500
and problem of people who are experiencing that

1673
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,520
in their home country.

1674
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,560
I know how cold-hearted this sounds,

1675
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,320
but maybe honestly it could be because I'm Indian.

1676
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,050
One of the things that whenever you visit India

1677
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,850
and you see a country with over a billion people,

1678
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,070
you're like, holy shit, you know this,

1679
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:32,970
this is crazy.

1680
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:36,750
And you understand both the sheer numbers

1681
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,280
of the amount of people involved.

1682
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,100
And also, there is nothing in the world you could ever do

1683
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,510
to solve all problems for everybody.

1684
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,820
It's a very complex and dynamic problem.

1685
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,380
And it's really nice to be bleeding heart

1686
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,647
and to say, "Oh, well, we have responsibility to this

1687
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:50,305
and to all mankind and all that."

1688
01:02:50,305 --> 01:02:51,270
But it's just, it doesn't work.

1689
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,650
It doesn't work with a nation state,

1690
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,300
it doesn't work with the sovereign nation.

1691
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,550
We're the luckiest people in the history

1692
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,180
of the world live here in this country.

1693
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,220
And you need to protect it.

1694
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,930
And protecting it requires

1695
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:04,290
really thinking about the fundamentals of immigration itself

1696
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,670
and not telling us stories.

1697
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:09,180
Like there's a famous moment from the Trump White House

1698
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:13,110
where Jim Acosta, CNN White House correspondent got into it

1699
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,697
with Stephen Miller, the current, you know,

1700
01:03:15,697 --> 01:03:17,700
who'll be the current deputy chief.

1701
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,350
And he was like, what do you say,

1702
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:21,090
something along the lines to people who say

1703
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,380
you're violating, you know,

1704
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,970
that quote on the Statue of Liberty,

1705
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:24,870
like give me, you're tired,

1706
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,730
you're poor, you're hungry, all of that,

1707
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:27,840
the Emma Lazarus quote,

1708
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,180
and Stephen very logically was like,

1709
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,820
what level of immigration comports

1710
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,140
with the Emma Lazarus quote?

1711
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:35,760
Is it 200,000 people a year?

1712
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,920
Is it 300? Is it 1 million?

1713
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,540
Is it 1.5 million?

1714
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,400
And that's such a great way of putting it

1715
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,950
because there is no limiting principle

1716
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,420
on Emma Lazarus quote.

1717
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,030
There is, when you start talking, honestly, you're like,

1718
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:52,560
okay, we live in X, Y, and Z society with X, Y and Z GDP,

1719
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,780
people who are coming here should be able to benefit

1720
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,780
for themselves and us not rely on welfare,

1721
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,260
not, you know, be people who we have to take care of after

1722
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,210
because we have our own problems here right now.

1723
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,137
And who are the population

1724
01:04:04,137 --> 01:04:06,210
and the types of people that we can study and look at

1725
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,440
who will be able to benefit?

1726
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:10,020
And based on that, yeah, immigration is great,

1727
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,260
but there are a lot of economic, legal,

1728
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,070
and societal reasons for why

1729
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,080
you definitely don't want the current level.

1730
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:24,030
But another thing is, even if we turn the switch

1731
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:27,630
and we still let in 1,000,005 people a year

1732
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,930
under the chain family-based migration,

1733
01:04:30,930 --> 01:04:32,460
I think it would be a colossal mistake

1734
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,183
because it's not rooted in the idea that people

1735
01:04:35,183 --> 01:04:38,400
who are coming to America are explicitly doing so

1736
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:39,630
at the benefit of America.

1737
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,480
It's doing so based on the familial connections of people

1738
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,670
who already gamed the immigration system

1739
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:45,600
to be able to come here.

1740
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,460
I have a lot of family in India

1741
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:48,930
and you know, I love them, but,

1742
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,910
and some of them are actually very talented and qualified.

1743
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,020
If they wanted to come here,

1744
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,150
I think they should be able to apply on their own merit.

1745
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,137
And that should have nothing to do

1746
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:56,550
with their familial status

1747
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:59,010
of the fact that I'm a U.S. citizen.

1748
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,080
- Like you mentioned the book "Melting Pot or Civil War"

1749
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,180
by Reihan Salam,

1750
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,640
he makes an argument against open borders.

1751
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,813
The thesis there is assimilation should be a big part.

1752
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,320
I guess there's some kind of optimal rate of immigration

1753
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,670
which allows for assimilation.

1754
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,470
- Yeah, and there are ebbs and flows

1755
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:18,150
and that's kinda what I was talking about historically

1756
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:21,020
where, you know, I mean the truth is,

1757
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,620
is you could walk the streets of New York City

1758
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,660
in the early 1900s and late 1890s

1759
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,010
and you're not gonna hear any English.

1760
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:27,210
And I think that's bad.

1761
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:30,210
I mean, really what you had was ethnic enclaves

1762
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,730
of people who were basically practicing their way of life

1763
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,230
just like they did previously,

1764
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,807
bringing over a lot of their ethnic problems that they had

1765
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:40,050
and even some of their cultural like unique capabilities

1766
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,880
or whatever, bringing it to America.

1767
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,200
And then New York City police

1768
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,220
and others are figuring out like,

1769
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,810
what the hell do we do with all this?

1770
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,540
And it literally took shutting down immigration

1771
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:51,090
for an entire generation to do away with that.

1772
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,560
And there's actually still some.

1773
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,930
The point about assimilation is twofold.

1774
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:58,170
One is that you should have the capacity

1775
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:02,490
to inherit the understanding of the American character

1776
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,870
that has nothing to do with race.

1777
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,120
And that's so unique that I can sit here

1778
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,400
as a child of people from India

1779
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,283
and has such a deep appreciation for the Scots-Irish.

1780
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,240
I consider myself, you know, American first.

1781
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,790
And one of the things that I really love about that is that

1782
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:21,510
I have no historical relationship to anybody

1783
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:23,010
who fought in the Civil War,

1784
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:26,610
but I feel such kinship with a lot of the people who did

1785
01:06:26,610 --> 01:06:30,330
and reading the memoirs and the ideas of those that did,

1786
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:34,320
because that same mindset of the victors

1787
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,460
and the values that they were able to instill in the country

1788
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,300
for 150 years later gives me the ability to connect to them.

1789
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,097
And that's such an incredible victory on their part.

1790
01:06:44,097 --> 01:06:45,710
And that's such a unique thing

1791
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,520
in almost every other country in the world,

1792
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,500
in China and India or wherever,

1793
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,140
you're kind of like what you are,

1794
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,270
you're a Hindu, you're a Jew, you're a, you know,

1795
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:56,280
you're Han Chinese, you're a Uyghur,

1796
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:58,140
or you're Tibetan, something like that.

1797
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:00,750
You're born into it, but really here,

1798
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,340
one of the only places in the world

1799
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,380
where you can really connect to that story

1800
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:06,660
and that spirit and the compounding effect

1801
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,210
of all of these different people who come to America.

1802
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,790
And that is a celebration of immigration as an idea.

1803
01:07:11,790 --> 01:07:14,430
But immigration is also a discreet policy

1804
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,980
and that policy was really screwed up by

1805
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:18,600
the Biden administration.

1806
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:20,880
And so we can celebrate the idea

1807
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,530
and also pursue a policy

1808
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:26,130
for all of the people in the U.S., our citizens,

1809
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,570
to actually be able to benefit

1810
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,600
and, look, it's gonna be messy.

1811
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,550
And honestly, I still don't know yet

1812
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,700
if Trump will be able to pursue actual mass deportation

1813
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:37,260
just because I think that

1814
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,640
I'm not sure the public is ready for it.

1815
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,080
I do support mass deportation.

1816
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,120
I don't know if the public is ready for it.

1817
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,520
I think, I don't know, I'll have to see,

1818
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,170
because there's a lot of different ways that you can do it.

1819
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:48,930
There's mandatory E-Verify, which requires businesses

1820
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:50,940
to basically verify you're a U.S. citizen

1821
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,890
or you're here illegally whenever they employ you.

1822
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:54,360
Which is not the law of the land currently,

1823
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,190
which is crazy by the way.

1824
01:07:56,190 --> 01:07:58,200
There's, you know, you can cut off

1825
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,480
for tax remittance payments,

1826
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,250
which are payments that are sent back

1827
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:05,400
to other countries like Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala.

1828
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,130
Again, illustrating my economic migrant point.

1829
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,270
There are a lot of various different ways

1830
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,290
where you can just make it more difficult

1831
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:13,350
to be illegally here in the U.S. so people will self-deport,

1832
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:17,133
but you know, if he does pursue like real mass deportation,

1833
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:19,859
that will be a flashpoint in America.

1834
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:21,870
- Aren't you talking about things like

1835
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:25,470
what Tom Holman said that works at raids,

1836
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,357
sort of increasing the rate of that?

1837
01:08:27,357 --> 01:08:29,005
- Yeah, we used to do that, you know.

1838
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:29,837
- But. - Yeah,

1839
01:08:29,837 --> 01:08:33,029
- But there's a rate at which you can do that,

1840
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:38,029
where it would lead to, I mean, radical social upheaval.

1841
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:38,962
- Yeah, it will, I mean,

1842
01:08:38,962 --> 01:08:41,069
and I think some people need to be honest here.

1843
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:43,890
And this actually flies in the face of,

1844
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:47,760
I mean one of the most common liberal critiques is

1845
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,260
this is gonna raise prices.

1846
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,990
And yeah, I think it's true.

1847
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,823
I think it's worth it.

1848
01:08:52,823 --> 01:08:55,529
But that's easy for me to say, I'm making a good living.

1849
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:57,810
If you care about inflation, you voted for Donald Trump

1850
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:00,149
and your price of groceries or whatever goes up

1851
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:02,399
because of this immigration policy.

1852
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,680
I think that needs to be extremely well articulated

1853
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,513
by the president.

1854
01:09:05,513 --> 01:09:07,290
And of course, he needs to think about it.

1855
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:10,380
The truth is is America right now is built on cheap labor.

1856
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:12,330
It's not fair to the consumer,

1857
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:14,310
it's not fair to the immigrants,

1858
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:15,810
the illegal immigrants themselves.

1859
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:18,120
And it's not fair to the natural-born citizen.

1860
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,700
The natural-born citizen has his wages suppressed

1861
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,067
for competition by tens of millions of people

1862
01:09:23,067 --> 01:09:25,500
who are willing to work at lower wages.

1863
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,319
They have to compete for housing, for social services.

1864
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,370
I mean just even, you know,

1865
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:33,390
like basic stuff at a societal level, it's not fair to them.

1866
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:34,680
It's definitely not fair to the other person

1867
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,390
'cause I mean when everyone,

1868
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:39,000
people say like who's gonna build your houses or whatever,

1869
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
you're endorsing this quasi-legal system where,

1870
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:48,149
you know, uninsured laborers from Mexico,

1871
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:50,910
they have no guarantee of wages.

1872
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,920
They're getting paid cash under the table.

1873
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,130
They are living, you know, 10 to a room.

1874
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:58,770
They're sending Mexican remittance payments back

1875
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:00,060
just so that their children can eat.

1876
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:01,906
I mean, that's not really fair to that person either.

1877
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:03,570
So that's the point.

1878
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:05,340
The point is, is that it will lead

1879
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:06,990
to a lot of social upheaval.

1880
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:09,900
But this gets to my Kristi Noem point as well is

1881
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,880
you need to be able to articulate

1882
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,900
a lot of what I just said here,

1883
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,842
because if you don't, it's gonna go south real quick.

1884
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:18,990
- The way that Vivek articulates this is that

1885
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:21,600
our immigration system is deeply dishonest.

1886
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,810
Like we don't acknowledge some of the things you just said.

1887
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:25,890
- Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1888
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:27,300
- And he wants to make it honest.

1889
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,100
So if we don't do mass deportation,

1890
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,540
at least you have to be really honest

1891
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:34,410
about the living conditions of illegal immigrants,

1892
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:37,800
about basically mistreatment of them.

1893
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,420
- Yes, it's true, I mean, you know,

1894
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:42,450
if you support mass illegal migration,

1895
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,780
you're basically supporting tens of millions

1896
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,030
who are living lives as second class citizens.

1897
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:49,560
That's not fair to them.

1898
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,960
I also think it's deeply paternalistic.

1899
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:56,670
So there's this idea that America has so ruined

1900
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,230
these Central American countries

1901
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:00,330
that they have no agency whatsoever

1902
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,280
and they can never turn things around.

1903
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,511
What does that say about our confidence in them?

1904
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:05,850
You know, one of the things they always say there,

1905
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:08,160
oh, they're law abiding, they're great people and all that.

1906
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,690
I agree, okay?

1907
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,580
By and large, I'm not saying these are bad people,

1908
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,040
but I am saying like if they're not bad

1909
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,620
and they're law abiding and they're citizens and thoughtful

1910
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,510
and all that, they can fix their own countries.

1911
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:20,190
And they did in El Salvador.

1912
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,660
That's the perfect example.

1913
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,360
Look at the dramatic drop in their crime rate.

1914
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,580
Bukele is one of the most popular leaders

1915
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,797
in all of South America

1916
01:11:27,797 --> 01:11:31,170
that is proof positive that you can change things around

1917
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,050
despite perhaps the legacy of U.S. intervention.

1918
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:38,220
So you know, to just say this idea that, you know,

1919
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,260
because it's America's fault that they're screwed up,

1920
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,060
it takes agency away from them.

1921
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,400
You know, another really key part of this dishonesty,

1922
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,890
this really gets to Springfield and the whole Haitian thing

1923
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,150
because everybody, you know,

1924
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:50,550
beyond the eating cats and dogs,

1925
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:52,560
everybody does not even acknowledge

1926
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,510
'cause when they're like the Haitians are here legally,

1927
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:56,070
they need to actually think about the program.

1928
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,420
The program is called TPS.

1929
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,620
So let me explain that.

1930
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,500
TPS is called temporary protected status,

1931
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,120
note, what's the first word in that?

1932
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,990
Temporary.

1933
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,070
What does that mean?

1934
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:08,250
TPS was developed under a regime in which,

1935
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,710
let's say that there was a catastrophic,

1936
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,030
I think this is a real example.

1937
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:13,110
I think there was like a volcano

1938
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:14,730
or an earthquake or something

1939
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:16,350
where people were granted TPS

1940
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:17,550
to come to the United States.

1941
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:19,950
And the idea was they were gonna go back after it was safe.

1942
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:20,970
They just never went back.

1943
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:25,140
There are children born in the United States today

1944
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,450
who are literally the descent,

1945
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,640
who are adults, who are the descendants of people

1946
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,910
who are still living in the U.S. under TPS.

1947
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:36,270
That's a perfect example of what Vivek says is dishonest.

1948
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,000
You know, you can't mass defacto legalize people

1949
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,980
by saying that they're here temporarily

1950
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:44,400
because of a program or because of something that happened

1951
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,030
in their home country when the reality is is that in,

1952
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,560
for all intents and purposes,

1953
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:52,560
we are acknowledging them as full legal migrants.

1954
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,480
So you know, even the term migrant

1955
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,717
to these Haitians in Springfield makes no sense

1956
01:12:56,717 --> 01:13:00,030
'cause they're supposed to be here under TPS, that's not,

1957
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,280
migrant implies permanency.

1958
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,680
So the language is all dishonest.

1959
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,630
And people don't wanna tell you about the things

1960
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:07,627
I just said about chain migration.

1961
01:13:07,627 --> 01:13:09,777
You know, the vast majority of Americans don't even know

1962
01:13:09,777 --> 01:13:11,430
the immigration system works.

1963
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,113
They don't understand what I just said about TPS.

1964
01:13:13,113 --> 01:13:16,050
They don't really understand the insanity of asylum law

1965
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:17,977
where you can just literally throw up your hands and say,

1966
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,080
"I fear for my life."

1967
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:21,030
And you get to live here for four, five years

1968
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:22,680
before your court date even happens.

1969
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,700
And you know, by that time, get a work permit or whatever,

1970
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,050
you can, you know,

1971
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:30,930
get housing like you just said in substandard conditions

1972
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:33,270
and you can kind of just play the game and wait

1973
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,860
before a deportation order comes.

1974
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:36,420
And even if it does, you never have to leave

1975
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,650
because there's no ICE agent

1976
01:13:37,650 --> 01:13:39,090
or whatever who's gonna enforce it.

1977
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:40,617
So the whole system is nuts right now,

1978
01:13:40,617 --> 01:13:43,320
and we need complete systematic reform

1979
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,820
that burns it all to the ground.

1980
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,950
- That said sort of the image

1981
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:49,830
and the reality of a child being separated

1982
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:54,830
from their parents seems deeply un-American, right?

1983
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:58,740
- Well, I mean look, it gets, okay, so, you know,

1984
01:13:58,740 --> 01:13:59,610
I'm not gonna defend it,

1985
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:01,770
but I'll just put it this way.

1986
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,270
Nobody- - Do you hate children?

1987
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:04,770
- Yeah. See, this is what I mean.

1988
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:05,850
Do you think twice

1989
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:08,010
whenever you see a drug addict who's put in prison

1990
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:10,563
and their child is put in protective services?

1991
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:14,160
Nobody in America thinks twice about that, right?

1992
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,450
- Yeah. - So I mean,

1993
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:17,010
well, that's kind of screwed up.

1994
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,450
Well, what we should think about,

1995
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:19,887
why did we come to that conclusion?

1996
01:14:19,887 --> 01:14:21,660
The conclusion was is that

1997
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:24,360
these adults willingly broke the law

1998
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:27,630
and pursued a path of life which put them on a, you know,

1999
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,190
which put them on a trajectory

2000
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:31,320
where the state had to come in and determine

2001
01:14:31,320 --> 01:14:34,470
that you are not allowed to be a parent basically

2002
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,960
to this child while you serve your debt to society.

2003
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:38,730
Now, child separation was very different.

2004
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:39,831
Child separation was also a product

2005
01:14:39,831 --> 01:14:44,831
of extremely strange circumstances in U.S. immigration law,

2006
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,950
where basically at the time,

2007
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,407
the reason why it was happening was

2008
01:14:48,407 --> 01:14:51,150
'cause there was no way to prosecute people

2009
01:14:51,150 --> 01:14:54,180
for illegal entry without child separation.

2010
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,590
Because previous doctrine,

2011
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:58,830
I believe it's called the Flores Doctrine under,

2012
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,360
it's some asylum law,

2013
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:02,070
people will have to go check my work on this.

2014
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,630
But basically, the whole reason

2015
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:05,190
this evolved is illegal regime

2016
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:07,650
was because people figured out

2017
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:08,910
that if you bring a kid with you

2018
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:11,460
because of the so-called Flores Doctrine or whatever,

2019
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:14,250
that you couldn't be prosecuted for illegal entry.

2020
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,890
So it was a defacto way of breaking the law.

2021
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:20,430
And in fact, a lot of people were bringing children here

2022
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:22,170
who weren't even theirs, who weren't,

2023
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,730
they weren't even related to or couldn't even,

2024
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,350
you know, prove it.

2025
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:28,140
We're bringing them to get around

2026
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:30,060
the prosecution for illegal entry.

2027
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:31,710
So I'm not defending child separation,

2028
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:33,300
I think it was horrible or whatever.

2029
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,610
But you know, if I gave you the context,

2030
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:37,800
it does seem like a very tricky problem

2031
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,440
in terms of do we enforce the law or not,

2032
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,030
how are we able to do that.

2033
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:44,223
And the solution, honestly,

2034
01:15:45,076 --> 01:15:47,160
is it's just what Donald Trump did was remain in Mexico

2035
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,730
and then pursue a complete rewrite of the way that we have

2036
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:55,560
U.S. asylum law applied and of asylum adjudication

2037
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,860
and really just about enforcing our actual laws.

2038
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,660
So when I try to explain

2039
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:04,500
to people is the immigration system right now is a patchwork

2040
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,350
of this deeply dishonest, such a great word,

2041
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:12,350
deeply dishonest system in which you use the system

2042
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,310
and set it up in such ways

2043
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:16,920
that illegal immigration is actually one

2044
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,150
of the easiest things to do

2045
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:21,000
to accomplish immigration to the United States.

2046
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,170
That is wrong.

2047
01:16:22,170 --> 01:16:23,940
My parents had to apply.

2048
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:24,960
It wasn't easy.

2049
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,120
Do you know in India there's a temple called

2050
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,690
the Visa Temple where you walk 108 times around it,

2051
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:32,010
which is like a lucky number.

2052
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,470
And if you do it when you're applying for a visa

2053
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,430
to the United States, all right,

2054
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,170
it costs a lot of money and it's hard.

2055
01:16:37,170 --> 01:16:38,460
People get rejected all the time.

2056
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,900
There's billions of people across the world

2057
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,970
who would love to be able to come here.

2058
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,980
And many of them want to do so legally,

2059
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:45,840
and they should have to go through a process.

2060
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,580
The current way it works is it's easier

2061
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,350
to get here illegally than it is legally.

2062
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,183
I think that's fundamentally right.

2063
01:16:50,183 --> 01:16:51,870
It's also unfair to people like us

2064
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,370
whose parents did come here legally.

2065
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:55,800
- Can you steer me on the case against mass deportation?

2066
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,480
What are the strongest arguments?

2067
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:58,830
- The strongest argument would be that

2068
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,630
these people contribute to society.

2069
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:03,810
That these people, many of whom, millions of here,

2070
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,660
have been here for many years, who have children,

2071
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:09,630
natural-born citizens because of birthright citizenship.

2072
01:17:09,630 --> 01:17:11,130
It would require something

2073
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:13,620
that's fundamentally inhumane in an American, as you said,

2074
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,960
the idea of separating families, you know,

2075
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,250
across different borders

2076
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,580
simply because of what is quote unquote

2077
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,190
like "small decision" of coming here illegally.

2078
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:27,240
And the best case beyond any of this moral stuff

2079
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:31,020
for no mass deportation is, it's good for business.

2080
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:33,780
Illegal immigration is great for big business.

2081
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:36,060
It is great for big agriculture.

2082
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:39,300
So if you want the lowest prices of all time,

2083
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,670
then yeah, mass deportation is a terrible idea.

2084
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,593
- But first of all, very convincing.

2085
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,080
And second of all- - Yeah.

2086
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:49,140
- I mean you can't just do mass deportation

2087
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,240
without also fixing the immigration system,

2088
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,200
right? - Yes, exactly.

2089
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,490
And I mean there are,

2090
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:55,710
there's several pieces of legislation, H.R.2,

2091
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:56,880
that's something that the Republicans have

2092
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:58,140
really coalesced around.

2093
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,010
It's a border bill.

2094
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:00,270
I encourage people to go read it

2095
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:01,590
and see some of the different fixes

2096
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,270
to the U.S. immigration system.

2097
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:05,940
I'm curious whether it'll actually pass or not.

2098
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:07,980
Remember, there's a very slim majority

2099
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:10,200
of the House of Representatives for Republicans

2100
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,040
this time around.

2101
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,600
And people vote for a lot of things

2102
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:13,440
when they're not in power,

2103
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,050
but when it's actually about to become the law, we'll see.

2104
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,180
There's a lot of swing state people out there

2105
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:20,910
who may think twice before casting that vote.

2106
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:23,790
So I'm definitely curious to see how that one plays out.

2107
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:26,640
The other thing is, is that, like I just said,

2108
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,772
the biggest beneficiary

2109
01:18:27,772 --> 01:18:29,760
of illegal immigration is big business.

2110
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,340
So if you think they're gonna take this one lying down,

2111
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,600
absolutely not.

2112
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,150
They will fight for everything that they have

2113
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:38,100
to keep their pool of cheap labor

2114
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,000
because it's great for them.

2115
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,813
You know, I think JD said a story,

2116
01:18:40,813 --> 01:18:43,560
I think he was on Rogan about how he talked

2117
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,260
to a hotelier chain guy

2118
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,450
and he was just, he was like, "Yeah, it's just terrible.

2119
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:49,590
You know, it's like they would take away

2120
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,760
our whole workforce."

2121
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,770
And he was like, "Do you hear yourself?

2122
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,240
In terms of what you're talking,

2123
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,040
you're bragging about," but that's real.

2124
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,090
That's a real thing.

2125
01:18:57,090 --> 01:18:59,580
And that, you know, Tyson's Foods

2126
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,520
and all these other people like, you know,

2127
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:05,520
that's another really sad part is,

2128
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,310
what I mean by second class citizenship is this presumption

2129
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:10,920
first of all that Americans think it's too disgusting

2130
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,230
to process meat or to work in a field.

2131
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:14,400
I think anybody will do anything

2132
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,470
for the right wage first of all.

2133
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,450
But second is, you know,

2134
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:20,850
the conditions in a lot of those facilities are horrible

2135
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:22,260
and they're covered up for a reason.

2136
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:25,140
Not only in terms of the way that businesses, you know,

2137
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,250
like do they actually conduct themselves,

2138
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,770
but also to cover up their illegal immigrant workforce.

2139
01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:29,603
So honestly, I think

2140
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,140
it could make things better for everything.

2141
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,880
- You have studied how government works.

2142
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,590
What are the chances of mass deportation happens?

2143
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:35,550
- Well, it depends how you define it.

2144
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:38,040
So I mean, mass deportation could lean one million.

2145
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:38,970
I mean, nobody even knows

2146
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:39,990
how many people are here illegally.

2147
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:42,030
It could be 20 million, it could be 30 million.

2148
01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:44,220
I've seen estimates of up to 30 million, which is crazy.

2149
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,650
That's almost 1/11 of the entire U.S. population.

2150
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:50,070
- What number do you think will feel like mass deportation?

2151
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:51,210
One million people?

2152
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,380
- A million people is a lot.

2153
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,767
I mean, if you think about- - That's a lot of people.

2154
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:54,600
- It's a lot, I mean,

2155
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,210
but the crazy part is that's only 1/12

2156
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:57,750
of what Joe Biden led to the country.

2157
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:01,470
So it's one of those that just to give people the scale

2158
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:04,410
of what it will all look like.

2159
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:06,630
Do I think mass deportation will happen?

2160
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,250
It depends on the definition.

2161
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,370
Will one million over four years?

2162
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:13,470
Yeah, I feel relatively confident in that.

2163
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,730
Anything over that, it's gonna be tough to say.

2164
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,520
Like I said, probably the most efficient way

2165
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,430
to do it is to have mandatory E-Verify

2166
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,470
and to have processes in place

2167
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:27,480
where it becomes very difficult

2168
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,370
to live in the United States illegally.

2169
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:31,800
And then you'll have mass self-deportation

2170
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,590
and they will take the victory lap on that.

2171
01:20:34,590 --> 01:20:38,520
But actual, like rounding millions of people up

2172
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,640
and putting them in deportation facilities

2173
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:42,930
and then arranging flights

2174
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:45,660
to God knows all across the globe,

2175
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:47,370
that's a logistical nightmare.

2176
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:48,840
It would also cost a lot of money.

2177
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,200
And don't forget, Congress has to pay for all of this.

2178
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:55,200
So you know, we can have DOGE

2179
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:57,480
or we can have, you know, mass deportation.

2180
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,780
So those two things are kind of irreconcilable actually.

2181
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:03,270
There's a lot of competing influences at play

2182
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:06,060
that people are not being real about at all.

2183
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:09,090
- Yeah, that was one of the tensions I had talking to Vivek,

2184
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:11,490
is he's big on mass deportation

2185
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:15,000
and big on making government more efficient.

2186
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,190
And it really feels like there's a tension

2187
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:19,080
between those two in the short-term.

2188
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:20,460
- Well, yes, absolutely.

2189
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:22,290
Also, I mean, this is a good segue.

2190
01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:23,700
I've been wanting to talk about this.

2191
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,160
I'm sympathetic to DOGE,

2192
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,030
to the whole Department of Government Efficiency.

2193
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,513
- How unreal is it that it's called DOGE.

2194
01:21:29,513 --> 01:21:31,290
- Actually with Elon, it's quite real.

2195
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:33,680
I guess I've just, you know, I've accepted Elon

2196
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,240
as a major political figure in the U.S.,

2197
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,370
but the DOGE Committee,

2198
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:42,390
the Department of Government Efficiency is a non-statutory

2199
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:44,550
agency that has zero funding

2200
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:47,490
that Donald Trump says will advise OMB,

2201
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,290
the Office of Management and Budget.

2202
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:50,820
Now, two things.

2203
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:53,550
Number one is, as I predicted,

2204
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:56,490
DOGE would become a quote unquote "Blue Ribbon Commission."

2205
01:21:56,490 --> 01:21:58,890
So this is a non-statutory Blue Ribbon Commission

2206
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:02,220
that has been given authority to Vivek Ramaswamy

2207
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:03,450
and to Elon Musk.

2208
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,230
Secondary, their recommendations

2209
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:08,400
to government should be complete by July of 2026,

2210
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,190
according to the press release released by Trump.

2211
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:12,090
First of all,

2212
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:14,130
what that will mean is they're probably gonna need

2213
01:22:14,130 --> 01:22:15,750
private funding to even set all this up.

2214
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:17,430
That's great, not a problem for Elon,

2215
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:20,443
but you're basically gonna be able to have to commission

2216
01:22:20,443 --> 01:22:22,816
GAO Reports, Government Accountability Office

2217
01:22:22,816 --> 01:22:25,620
and other reports and fact finding missions

2218
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,350
across the government, which is fantastic.

2219
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:30,060
Trump can even empower you

2220
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,091
to go through to every agency and to collect figures.

2221
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:34,980
None of it matters one iota

2222
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:36,480
if Republican appropriators

2223
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,000
in the House of Representatives care what you have to say,

2224
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,620
historically, they don't give a shit

2225
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,570
what the executive office has to say.

2226
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:46,200
So every year, the president releases his own budget.

2227
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,550
It used to mean something,

2228
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,080
but in the last decade or so,

2229
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:50,790
it's become completely meaningless.

2230
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:52,260
The House Ways and Means Committee

2231
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,270
and the People's House are the ones who originate

2232
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:56,640
all appropriations and set up spending.

2233
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,810
So that's one is that DOGE in and of itself has no power,

2234
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:03,960
it has no ability to compel

2235
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,940
or force people to do anything.

2236
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:08,910
Its entire case for being,

2237
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:10,680
really, if you think about it mechanically,

2238
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:12,990
is to try and convince and provide a report

2239
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:15,720
to Republican legislators to be able to cut spending.

2240
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:16,560
So that's that.

2241
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,000
Now we all know how Congress takes to government reports

2242
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,860
and whether they get acted on or not.

2243
01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:24,030
So that's number one.

2244
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:28,050
Number two is the figures that Elon is throwing out there.

2245
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:29,940
I, again, I wanna give them some advice

2246
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,680
because people do not understand

2247
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,880
federal government spending.

2248
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,220
The absolute vast majority

2249
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,950
of government spending is entitlement programs

2250
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:40,380
like Social Security and Medicare,

2251
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,660
which are untouchable under Donald Trump

2252
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,880
and the most politically popular programs in the world.

2253
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,600
And military spending, discretionary, non-military spending,

2254
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:50,310
I don't have the exact figure in front of me,

2255
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:53,190
is a very, very small part of the federal budget.

2256
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:56,059
Now, within that small slice,

2257
01:23:56,059 --> 01:23:59,580
about 90% of that eight is bipartisan

2258
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,530
and is supported by like everybody.

2259
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:03,840
NOAA the, you know, the hurricane guys,

2260
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:04,673
like people like that.

2261
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:05,640
You know, people who are flying

2262
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,870
into the eye of the hurricane,

2263
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:10,800
people who are government inspectors of X, Y, and Z.

2264
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,330
The parts that are controversial

2265
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:14,190
that you're actually able to touch,

2266
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:16,170
things like welfare programs,

2267
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:19,860
like food stamps is an extraordinary small slice.

2268
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:21,420
So there, what's the number he put out there?

2269
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:23,160
5 trillion, something like that.

2270
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,480
There is only one way to do that.

2271
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:26,790
And realistically, under the current thing,

2272
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:28,530
you have to radically change the entire way

2273
01:24:28,530 --> 01:24:31,380
that the Pentagon buys everything.

2274
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:34,680
And I support that, but I just wanna be very, very clear,

2275
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,340
but I haven't seen enough energy around that.

2276
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:40,470
There's this real belief in the U.S.

2277
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:44,460
that we spend billions on all of these programs

2278
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,660
that are doing complete bullshit.

2279
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:48,360
But like the truth, the absolute vast majority

2280
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,760
of it is military spending and entitlements.

2281
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,290
Trump has made clear entitlements are off the table,

2282
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:53,123
it's not gonna happen.

2283
01:24:53,123 --> 01:24:55,830
So the way that you're gonna be able to cut

2284
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:57,840
realistically military spending

2285
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:02,550
over a decade long period is to really change the way

2286
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:05,460
that the United States procures, you know,

2287
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:09,090
procures military equipment, hands out government contracts.

2288
01:25:09,090 --> 01:25:11,070
Elon actually does have the background to be able

2289
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:13,920
to accomplish this because he has had to wrangle with SpaceX

2290
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,660
and the bullshit that Boeing has been pulling for

2291
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:16,830
over a decade.

2292
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:19,530
But I really want everybody's expectations

2293
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:21,000
to be very set around this.

2294
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,120
Just remember non-statutory, Blue Ribbon.

2295
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,400
So if he's serious about it,

2296
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,050
I just laid out all of these hurdles

2297
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:30,150
that he's gonna have to overcome.

2298
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:32,460
And I'm not saying him and Vivek aren't serious dudes,

2299
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,800
but you got to really know the system

2300
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,970
to be able to accomplish this.

2301
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:39,840
- So you just laid out the reality of how Washington works.

2302
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,510
To give the counterpoint

2303
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:46,230
that I think you're probably also rooting for is that

2304
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:48,300
one as a statement like Peter Thiel said,

2305
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,310
don't bet against Elon. - True.

2306
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:53,010
- One of the things that you don't usually have

2307
01:25:53,010 --> 01:25:56,880
with Blue Ribbon is the kind of megaphone that Elon has.

2308
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,830
- True. - And

2309
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:02,010
I would even set the financial aspects aside,

2310
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:06,120
just the influence he has with the megaphone,

2311
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:09,390
but also just with other people

2312
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:11,670
who are also really influential.

2313
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,710
I think that can have real power

2314
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:15,930
when backed by sort of a populous movement.

2315
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:16,770
- I don't disagree with you,

2316
01:26:16,770 --> 01:26:18,660
but let me give you a case where this just failed.

2317
01:26:18,660 --> 01:26:21,780
So Elon endorsed who for Senate Majority Leader?

2318
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:23,130
Rick Scott, right?

2319
01:26:23,130 --> 01:26:25,740
Who got the least amount of votes in the U.S. Senate

2320
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,300
for GOP leader?

2321
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,410
Rick Scott.

2322
01:26:28,410 --> 01:26:30,090
John Thune is the person who got it.

2323
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:32,430
Now, the reason I'm bringing that up,

2324
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:34,620
one of my favorite books, "Master of the Senate"

2325
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,610
by Robert Caro,

2326
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:37,110
part of the LBJ series,

2327
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,980
the Senate has an institution, it reveres independence,

2328
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:44,490
it reveres, I mean, the entire theory of the Senate

2329
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:47,190
is to cool down the mob

2330
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:49,740
that is in the House of Representatives and to deliberate.

2331
01:26:49,740 --> 01:26:51,690
That's its entire body.

2332
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:55,020
They are set up to be immune from public pressure.

2333
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:56,730
Now, I'm not saying they can't be pressured,

2334
01:26:56,730 --> 01:26:58,320
but that example I just gave

2335
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:00,450
on Rick Scott is a very important one of.

2336
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:02,610
He literally endorsed somebody for leader.

2337
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:03,870
So did Tucker Carlson.

2338
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:05,760
So did a lot of people online

2339
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,770
and only 13 senators voted for Rick Scott.

2340
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:09,300
The truth is, is that they don't care.

2341
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:10,410
Like they're set up

2342
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:13,950
where they're marginally popular in their own home states,

2343
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,570
they'll be able to win their primaries

2344
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:17,460
and that's all they really need to do to get elected.

2345
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,740
And they have six year terms, not even up for four years.

2346
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,390
So will Elon still be interested

2347
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:22,770
in politics six years from now?

2348
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:25,290
That's a legitimate question for a Republican senator.

2349
01:27:25,290 --> 01:27:27,900
So maybe he could get the House of Representatives

2350
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:29,790
to sign off maybe on some of his things.

2351
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:31,470
But there's no guarantee

2352
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:33,990
that the Senate is going to agree with any of that.

2353
01:27:33,990 --> 01:27:36,360
There's a story that Caro's tells

2354
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,670
in the "Master of the Senate" book, which I love,

2355
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,400
where Thomas Jefferson was in Paris

2356
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,410
during the writing of the Constitution.

2357
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:45,337
And he asked Washington, he said,

2358
01:27:45,337 --> 01:27:49,620
"Why did you put in a senate, a bicameral legislature?"

2359
01:27:49,620 --> 01:27:51,097
And Washington said,

2360
01:27:51,097 --> 01:27:53,880
"Why did you pour your tea into a saucer?"

2361
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,770
And Jefferson goes, "To cool it."

2362
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,350
And Washington says, "Just so."

2363
01:27:58,350 --> 01:28:00,150
That's how to explain it.

2364
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,530
He was a man of very few words.

2365
01:28:01,530 --> 01:28:03,240
He was a brilliant man.

2366
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:07,200
- Okay, so you actually outlined the most likely thing

2367
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,610
that's going to happen with DOGE

2368
01:28:08,610 --> 01:28:11,640
as it hits the wall of Washington.

2369
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,360
What is the sort of the most successful thing

2370
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,250
that can be pulled off?

2371
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,350
- The most successful thing they could do is,

2372
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,820
right now I think they're really obsessed

2373
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:24,030
with designing cuts, right?

2374
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:25,770
And identifying cuts.

2375
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:28,830
I would redesign systems, systems of procurement.

2376
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:33,060
I would redesign the way that we have processes in place

2377
01:28:33,060 --> 01:28:34,830
to dispense taxpayer dollars.

2378
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:39,000
Because the truth is, is that appropriations itself, again,

2379
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,100
are set by the United States Congress.

2380
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:45,660
But the way that those appropriations are spent

2381
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:46,560
by the government,

2382
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,620
the executive has some discretionary authority.

2383
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:53,280
So your ability as the executive to be a good steward

2384
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,920
of the taxpayer money and to redesign a system

2385
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,690
which I actually think Elon could be good at this

2386
01:28:57,690 --> 01:29:00,270
and Vivek too, in terms of their entrepreneurial spirit,

2387
01:29:00,270 --> 01:29:02,400
is the entire Pentagon procurement thing,

2388
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,780
it needs to be burned to the ground.

2389
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,520
Number one, it's bad for the Pentagon.

2390
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,440
It does, it gives them substandard equipment.

2391
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:11,340
It rewards very old weapon systems and programs

2392
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,803
and thinking that can be easily defeated by people

2393
01:29:13,803 --> 01:29:16,290
who are studying that for vulnerabilities.

2394
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:19,410
The perfect example is all of this drone warfare

2395
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:20,940
in Ukraine and in Russia.

2396
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,360
I mean, drone warfare costs almost nothing.

2397
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:27,570
And yet drone swarms and hypersonic missiles pose

2398
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:30,210
huge dangers to U.S. systems,

2399
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:31,790
which cost hundreds of billion,

2400
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,900
of more than hundreds of billions of dollars.

2401
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:37,470
So my point is that giving nimble procurement

2402
01:29:37,470 --> 01:29:39,480
and systemic change in the way

2403
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:41,580
that we think about executing the mission

2404
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,870
that Congress does give you

2405
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:44,820
actually could save the most amount of money

2406
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:45,810
in the long run.

2407
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:48,600
That's where I would really focus in on.

2408
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,433
The other one is,

2409
01:29:49,433 --> 01:29:52,020
you know, counter to everything I just said

2410
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:53,257
is maybe they would listen.

2411
01:29:53,257 --> 01:29:55,207
You know, maybe the Republicans are like,

2412
01:29:55,207 --> 01:29:57,450
"yeah, okay, let's do it."

2413
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:00,960
The problem again though is swing state people

2414
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,210
who need to get reelected, they need to do one thing,

2415
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:04,980
they need to deliver for their district.

2416
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:06,570
They need to run on stuff.

2417
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:10,200
And nobody has ever run on cutting money for your state.

2418
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,690
They have run on bringing money to your state.

2419
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:14,910
And that's why earmarks

2420
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:17,610
and a lot of these other things are extraordinarily popular

2421
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:20,370
in Congress is because it's such an easy way

2422
01:30:20,370 --> 01:30:22,770
to show constituents how you're working for them

2423
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:25,440
whenever it does come reelection time.

2424
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:28,140
So it's a very difficult system

2425
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:30,540
and I also wanna tell people who are frustrated by this,

2426
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:32,040
I share your frustration,

2427
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:34,273
but the system is designed to work this way.

2428
01:30:34,273 --> 01:30:37,920
And for two centuries the Senate has stood as a bulwark

2429
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,710
against literally every popular change.

2430
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:43,260
And because of that, it's designed to make sure

2431
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:46,020
that it's so popular for long enough

2432
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,550
that it has to become inevitable

2433
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:49,170
before the status quo can change.

2434
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:50,850
That's really, really frustrating.

2435
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,900
But you should take comfort

2436
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:53,070
in that it's always been that way.

2437
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:54,720
So it's been okay.

2438
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,430
- Well, as I've learned

2439
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:59,910
from one of the recommendations of "The Age of Acrimony,"

2440
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:02,190
is I feel embarrassed that I didn't know

2441
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:04,260
that senators used to not be elected.

2442
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:05,460
- What a crazy system, huh?

2443
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:09,330
- Yeah, I mean many of the things we take for granted now

2444
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:14,330
as defining our democracy was kind of invented,

2445
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,190
developed after the Civil War.

2446
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:18,900
- Right. - In the sort of 50 years

2447
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,740
after the Civil War.

2448
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:20,737
- Absolutely correct.

2449
01:31:20,737 --> 01:31:23,040
- "Age of Acrimony." Oh my god, I love that book.

2450
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,190
I cannot recommend it enough, it is so important.

2451
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:28,050
And one of the biggest mistakes

2452
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:30,540
that Americans make is that we study periods

2453
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:31,620
where greatness happened,

2454
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:34,170
but we don't often study periods where nothing happened

2455
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:36,000
or where really bad shit happened.

2456
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:37,260
- Yeah. - You know,

2457
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:38,670
we don't spend nearly enough.

2458
01:31:38,670 --> 01:31:40,230
Americans know about FDR,

2459
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:41,640
they don't really know anything about the depression

2460
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:43,350
or how we got there.

2461
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:46,290
What was it like to be alive in the United States

2462
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:47,790
in 1840, right?

2463
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:49,097
Nobody thinks about that really,

2464
01:31:49,097 --> 01:31:51,480
'cause it's kind of an in-between time in history.

2465
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,980
There are people who lived their entire lives,

2466
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:55,110
who were born, who had to live through those times,

2467
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,870
who were just as conscientious and intelligent

2468
01:31:57,870 --> 01:32:00,090
as you and I are, and we're just trying to figure shit out

2469
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:01,710
and things felt really big.

2470
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:03,510
So "The Age of Acrimony" is a time

2471
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:05,160
where it's almost completely ignored

2472
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,930
outside of the Gilded Age aspect.

2473
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:08,040
But like you just said,

2474
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,650
it was a time where progressive reform of government

2475
01:32:10,650 --> 01:32:13,590
and of the tension between civil rights,

2476
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:17,850
extraordinary wealth and democracy

2477
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:20,790
and really the reigning in of big business,

2478
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:24,480
so many of our foundations happened exactly in that time.

2479
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,010
And I take a lot of comfort from that book

2480
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:29,130
because one of the things I learned from the book is that

2481
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,810
voter participation is highest

2482
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:32,100
when people are pissed off,

2483
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,150
not when they're happy. - Yeah.

2484
01:32:33,150 --> 01:32:35,670
- And that's such a counterintuitive thing.

2485
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:37,830
But voter participation goes down

2486
01:32:37,830 --> 01:32:39,090
when the system is working.

2487
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,230
So 2020, right.

2488
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:42,570
I think we can all agree it was very tense election.

2489
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:46,020
That's also why it had the highest voter participation ever.

2490
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,410
2024, very high rates of participation, same thing.

2491
01:32:49,410 --> 01:32:50,310
People are pissed off

2492
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,410
and that's actually what drives them to the vote.

2493
01:32:52,410 --> 01:32:54,690
But something that I take comfort in that is that

2494
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:56,880
people being pissed off and people going out to vote,

2495
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,220
it actually does have major impact on the system

2496
01:32:59,220 --> 01:33:01,860
because otherwise, the status quo is basically

2497
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:03,420
allowed to continue.

2498
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:05,040
And so, yeah, like you just said,

2499
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,170
I mean, direct election of senators wasn't,

2500
01:33:07,170 --> 01:33:10,170
I mean, there are probably people alive today who are like,

2501
01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:13,230
who were born when there was no direct election of senators.

2502
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:15,030
Which is an insane thing to think about.

2503
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:16,800
I mean, it'd be almost a hundred or so.

2504
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,710
But the point is, is that at that time

2505
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:21,750
it was so deeply corrupt

2506
01:33:21,750 --> 01:33:24,570
and it was one where the quasi aristocracy

2507
01:33:24,570 --> 01:33:27,420
from the early days leading into the Gilded Age were able

2508
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:29,340
to enforce their will upon the people,

2509
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,200
but you can take comfort in that,

2510
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,610
that was one of those areas

2511
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:34,590
where Americans were so fed up with it,

2512
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:36,300
they changed the constitution

2513
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:38,460
and actually forced the aristocrats in power

2514
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:39,293
to give their own power.

2515
01:33:39,293 --> 01:33:41,670
- Yeah. - It's like our version

2516
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:43,050
of when they flipped power

2517
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:44,900
and took away the legislative power

2518
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,710
of the House of Lords in the UK.

2519
01:33:46,710 --> 01:33:47,970
I just think that's amazing.

2520
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:51,090
And it's such a cool thing about our country and the UK too.

2521
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:54,120
- It's the continued battle between

2522
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,460
the people and the elite.

2523
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,320
Right, and we should mention

2524
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:01,050
not just the direct election of senators,

2525
01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:05,077
but the election of candidates for a party.

2526
01:34:05,077 --> 01:34:07,230
- Yes. - That was also invented.

2527
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:10,230
It used to be that the quote unquote "party bosses,"

2528
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:15,120
I say that with a half a chuckle, chose the candidate.

2529
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,920
- Yeah, the whole system is nuts.

2530
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:19,440
The way that we currently experience politics is such

2531
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:20,438
a modern invention.

2532
01:34:20,438 --> 01:34:21,543
- With a little asterisk

2533
01:34:21,543 --> 01:34:22,590
with Kamala Harris,

2534
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:23,423
but you know. - Right.

2535
01:34:23,423 --> 01:34:24,480
Yeah, good point.

2536
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,060
- But, well, that was actually more

2537
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,720
of a mean reversion, right? - Yeah.

2538
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:29,520
- We're living in an extraordinarily new era

2539
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,170
where we actually have more input than ever

2540
01:34:31,170 --> 01:34:32,490
on who our candidates are.

2541
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:34,560
It used to be, this is crazy.

2542
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,870
So the conventions have always taken place

2543
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:37,860
two months before, right?

2544
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,450
Imagine a world where you did not know

2545
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:42,030
who the pre-nominee was gonna be before that convention.

2546
01:34:42,030 --> 01:34:45,570
And the nominee literally was decided at that convention

2547
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:46,890
by those party bosses.

2548
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:49,830
Even crazier, there used to be a standard

2549
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:51,120
in American politics

2550
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:53,910
where presidents did not directly campaign.

2551
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:56,550
They in fact did not even comment about the news

2552
01:34:56,550 --> 01:34:58,320
or mention their opponent's names.

2553
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,870
They would give speeches from their doorstep,

2554
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:03,870
but it was unseemly for them to engage

2555
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:05,010
in direct politics.

2556
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:07,013
- You would not get a Bernie Sanders.

2557
01:35:07,013 --> 01:35:08,370
- No, no. - You would not get

2558
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:09,300
a Donald Trump,

2559
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:10,680
- Obama, Bill Clinton,

2560
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:12,360
I mean, basically every president

2561
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,700
from John F. Kennedy onwards has been a product

2562
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,630
of the new system.

2563
01:35:15,630 --> 01:35:17,820
Every president prior to that has been much more

2564
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:18,653
of the older system.

2565
01:35:18,653 --> 01:35:21,000
There was a in-between period post FDR

2566
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:22,500
where things were really changing.

2567
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:26,130
But the primary system itself had its first true

2568
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:28,170
big win under John F. Kennedy.

2569
01:35:28,170 --> 01:35:29,730
- I think that the lesson from that is

2570
01:35:29,730 --> 01:35:32,220
there's a collective wisdom to the people, right?

2571
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:33,053
- I think so.

2572
01:35:33,053 --> 01:35:33,886
- I think it works.

2573
01:35:33,886 --> 01:35:38,010
- Yeah. I mean, well, okay, I'll steel man it.

2574
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:40,440
We had some great presidents in the party boss era.

2575
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,360
FDR was a great president.

2576
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:46,110
FDR was the master of coalitional politics of his ability.

2577
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:48,300
In fact, what really made him a genius was his ability

2578
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:49,890
to get this overthrow

2579
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:52,500
the support of a lot of the corruption

2580
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,470
and the elite democrats to take part,

2581
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:56,670
to take control in there at the convention.

2582
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:58,478
And then combine his personal popularity

2583
01:35:58,478 --> 01:36:01,200
to fuse all systems of power.

2584
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:05,430
Where he had the elites basically under his boot

2585
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:08,610
'cause he was the king and he used his popular power

2586
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:10,290
and his support from the people

2587
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:12,573
to be able to enforce things up and down.

2588
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:15,660
I mean, you know, even in the party boss era,

2589
01:36:15,660 --> 01:36:16,983
we would have no,

2590
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:20,370
a lot of the people we revere really came out of that,

2591
01:36:20,370 --> 01:36:21,900
people like Abraham Lincoln.

2592
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:24,480
I mean, I don't think Abraham Lincoln would have won

2593
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,130
a party primary in 1860.

2594
01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:27,720
There's no chance he won.

2595
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:30,210
He won, luck, thank God,

2596
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:34,800
from an insane process in the 1860 Republican Convention.

2597
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,020
People should go read about that because that was wild.

2598
01:36:37,020 --> 01:36:39,540
I think we were this close to not having Lincoln

2599
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,310
as president and yeah,

2600
01:36:41,310 --> 01:36:42,480
I mean, Teddy Roosevelt.

2601
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,920
There's so many that I could point to

2602
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,810
who made great impacts on history.

2603
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:49,260
So the system does find a way to still produce good stuff.

2604
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,480
- That was a kind of beautiful diversion

2605
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,190
from the DOGE discussion.

2606
01:36:53,190 --> 01:36:54,330
If you're gonna return briefly

2607
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:55,830
to DOGE. - Sure.

2608
01:36:55,830 --> 01:36:58,980
- So we kind of talked about cost cutting,

2609
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:01,473
but there's also increasing the efficiency of government.

2610
01:37:01,473 --> 01:37:02,670
- Yes. - Which you also kind

2611
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:04,590
of talked about procurement. - Yeah-

2612
01:37:04,590 --> 01:37:07,710
- So, and maybe we can throw into the pile

2613
01:37:07,710 --> 01:37:10,290
the 400 plus federal agencies.

2614
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:12,495
So let's take another perspective

2615
01:37:12,495 --> 01:37:14,460
on what success might look like.

2616
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:18,480
So like radically successful DOGE,

2617
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:22,230
would it basically cut a lot of federal agencies?

2618
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:23,430
- Probably combine.

2619
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:25,110
- Combine? - Okay, so I can give

2620
01:37:25,110 --> 01:37:27,120
great examples of this 'cause I have great insight.

2621
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:29,580
Like for each agency,

2622
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:32,100
we'll often use different like payroll systems.

2623
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,680
They'll have different internal processes, right?

2624
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:36,180
That makes no sense.

2625
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,460
And it's all because it's antiquated.

2626
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:40,950
Now, everybody always talks about changing it,

2627
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:45,090
but there are a lot of like party interests

2628
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:47,670
about why certain people get certain things.

2629
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:48,870
The real problem with government,

2630
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:51,810
the people like us who are private and like for example,

2631
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:53,880
when you wanna do something, you can just do it.

2632
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,000
So I was listening to a really interesting analysis

2633
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,630
about law enforcement and the military.

2634
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:05,630
So I think the story was that the military was assigned,

2635
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:07,620
National Guard guys were assigned to like help

2636
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:09,870
with the border and they were trying to provide,

2637
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:11,880
I think it was translation services

2638
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,260
to people at border patrol.

2639
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:14,580
But somebody had to come down

2640
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:16,470
and be like, "Hey, this has got to stop,

2641
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:19,380
according to U.S. code X, Y, and Z,

2642
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:22,650
the United States Military cannot help with law enforcement,

2643
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:24,030
you know, abilities here."

2644
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:27,540
And so even though that makes absolutely no sense,

2645
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:30,150
because there all work, there are literal legal statutes

2646
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:31,890
in place that prevent you from doing

2647
01:38:31,890 --> 01:38:33,390
the most efficient thing possible.

2648
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:36,240
So for some reason we have to have a ton of Spanish speakers

2649
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:39,900
in SOUTHCOM, you know, in the U.S. Command

2650
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:41,940
that is responsible for South America,

2651
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,520
who literally cannot help with a crisis at the border.

2652
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,790
Now maybe you can find some legal chicanery

2653
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:49,710
to make that work, but man,

2654
01:38:49,710 --> 01:38:51,510
you got to have an attorney general

2655
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:52,500
who knows what he's doing,

2656
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:53,730
you need a White House counsel,

2657
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:56,040
you need to make sure that shit stands up in a court of law.

2658
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,570
I mean, it's not so simple.

2659
01:38:57,570 --> 01:38:59,730
Whereas let's say, you know, you have a software right here

2660
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:01,380
and you wanna get a new software, you can just do it.

2661
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,270
You can hire whoever you want.

2662
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,460
When you're the government, there's a whole process

2663
01:39:05,460 --> 01:39:07,830
you got to go through about bidding

2664
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:11,970
and it just takes forever and it is so inefficient.

2665
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:15,690
But unfortunately, the inefficiency is really derivative

2666
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:17,850
of a lot of legal statutes.

2667
01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:20,730
And that is something that,

2668
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:21,900
yeah, again, actually, you know,

2669
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,240
radically successful "DOGE," quote unquote,

2670
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:28,200
would be study the law and then change it, you know, like,

2671
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:30,810
figure, instead of cost cutting,

2672
01:39:30,810 --> 01:39:32,910
like cut this program or whatever,

2673
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:36,000
like I just said about why do different systems use payroll?

2674
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,600
Just say that you can change the statute

2675
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,180
under which new software can be updated,

2676
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,740
let's say after 90 days.

2677
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,630
You know, I've heard stories of people who work

2678
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:48,360
for the government who still have like IBM mainframe,

2679
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,700
that they're still, in 2024, that they're still working

2680
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:53,370
'cause those systems have never been updated.

2681
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:54,420
There's also a big problem

2682
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:55,980
with a lot of this clearance stuff.

2683
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:57,840
That's where a lot of inefficiency happens

2684
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,870
because a lot of contractors can only work based upon

2685
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:02,910
previous clearance that they already got.

2686
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:04,800
Achieving a clearance is very expensive.

2687
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,420
It's very lengthy process.

2688
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:08,070
I'm not saying it shouldn't be,

2689
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:09,300
talking about security clearance,

2690
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:11,460
but it does naturally, you know,

2691
01:40:11,460 --> 01:40:12,900
create a very small pool

2692
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,667
that you can draw some contracts from.

2693
01:40:14,667 --> 01:40:16,890
And I even mean stuff like,

2694
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:18,690
like the janitor at the Pentagon needs

2695
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:20,190
a security service, right?

2696
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:23,130
So clearance, so there's only like five people who are,

2697
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:25,890
or can even apply for that contract.

2698
01:40:25,890 --> 01:40:28,620
Well, naturally, in an interim monopoly like that,

2699
01:40:28,620 --> 01:40:30,210
he's gonna jack his price up

2700
01:40:30,210 --> 01:40:33,240
because he literally has a moat around his product.

2701
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:35,850
Whereas if you or I are hiring a gen, whatever,

2702
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:37,200
anybody for anything,

2703
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,240
that type of credentialism and legal regime,

2704
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,380
it doesn't matter at all.

2705
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:42,510
So there are million problems like this

2706
01:40:42,510 --> 01:40:44,400
that people in government run into,

2707
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,730
and that is what I would say as the most successful.

2708
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:49,440
- You know, paperwork slows everything down

2709
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:54,000
and it feels impossible to break through that

2710
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,023
in a sort of incremental way.

2711
01:40:55,023 --> 01:40:57,000
- It's so hard. - It feels like the only way

2712
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,960
to do it is literally

2713
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,200
shut down agencies in some kind of radical way

2714
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:07,140
and then build up from scratch.

2715
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:11,084
Of course, as you highlight, that's going to be opposed

2716
01:41:11,084 --> 01:41:13,110
by a lot of people within government.

2717
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:15,043
- Yeah, well, historically there's only one way to do it

2718
01:41:15,043 --> 01:41:17,160
and it's a really bad answer, war,

2719
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:17,993
war, that's the- - Yeah.

2720
01:41:17,993 --> 01:41:19,560
So I was gonna say,

2721
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,940
basically, you have the kind of consensus where,

2722
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,980
okay, all this stupid bureaucratic bullshit

2723
01:41:25,980 --> 01:41:26,813
we've been doing,

2724
01:41:26,813 --> 01:41:29,130
we need to like put that shit aside.

2725
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:31,530
Get the fuck out of here, we need to win a war.

2726
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:32,910
So like all

2727
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:33,743
the paperwork. - That's it,

2728
01:41:33,743 --> 01:41:35,160
yeah. - You know, all the lawyers

2729
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,856
go leave, please.

2730
01:41:36,856 --> 01:41:37,973
- Yeah, exactly.

2731
01:41:37,973 --> 01:41:39,877
No, but I want people to really understand that,

2732
01:41:39,877 --> 01:41:44,100
you know, up until 1865 or 1860, I forget the exact year,

2733
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,140
we didn't even have national currency.

2734
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:49,560
And then we were like, well, we need a greenback.

2735
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:52,500
And prior to that, people would freak out

2736
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,390
if we were talking about having national currency

2737
01:41:54,390 --> 01:41:56,100
greenback backed by the, you know,

2738
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,570
the U.S. government and all that.

2739
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:59,610
Not even a question passed in like two weeks

2740
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:00,780
in the U.S. Congress.

2741
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,940
An income tax eventually went away,

2742
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:06,030
but not even in the realm of possibility

2743
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:07,140
and they decide to pass it.

2744
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,083
Same thing after World War I

2745
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:11,340
and you think about how World War II,

2746
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,500
I mean, World War II just fundamentally changed

2747
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,410
the entire way the United States government works.

2748
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:18,630
Even the DHS, which I mentioned earlier,

2749
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:20,250
the Department of Homeland Security,

2750
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:22,410
it didn't even exist prior to 9/11.

2751
01:42:22,410 --> 01:42:25,380
It was done as response to 9/11 to coalesce

2752
01:42:25,380 --> 01:42:28,470
all of those agencies under one branch to make sure

2753
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:31,440
that nothing like that could ever happen again.

2754
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,750
And so historically, unfortunately,

2755
01:42:33,750 --> 01:42:38,010
absolute shit show disaster war is the only thing

2756
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:41,430
that moves and throws the paperwork off the table.

2757
01:42:41,430 --> 01:42:44,490
And I wish I wasn't such a downer, but I've just,

2758
01:42:44,490 --> 01:42:46,290
I've both, I've read too much

2759
01:42:46,290 --> 01:42:48,900
and I've had enough experience now in Washington

2760
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:52,650
to just see how these dreams get crushed instantly.

2761
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:54,503
And I wish it wasn't that way.

2762
01:42:54,503 --> 01:42:56,130
I mean, it's a cool idea

2763
01:42:56,130 --> 01:42:57,930
and I want people who are inspired,

2764
01:42:57,930 --> 01:42:59,040
who are getting into politics

2765
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,480
to think that they can do something,

2766
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:01,980
but I want them to be realistic too.

2767
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,930
And I want them to know what they're signing up for

2768
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:04,950
whenever they do something like that.

2769
01:43:04,950 --> 01:43:06,990
And the titanic amount of work it's going to take

2770
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:08,310
for you to be able to accomplish something.

2771
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:10,500
- Yeah, but I've also heard a lot of people

2772
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:13,650
in Silicon Valley laughing when Elon rolled in

2773
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:15,630
and fired 90% of Twitter.

2774
01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:17,486
Here's this guy, Elon Musk, that-

2775
01:43:17,486 --> 01:43:19,620
- You are absolutely correct. - Knows nothing about running

2776
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:21,300
a social media company.

2777
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:22,770
Of course, you need all these servers,

2778
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:24,300
of course, you need all these employees.

2779
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:25,852
- Right. - And nevertheless,

2780
01:43:25,852 --> 01:43:27,300
the service keeps running.

2781
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:28,980
- He figured it out and you have to give him

2782
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:30,360
eternal credit for that.

2783
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:31,710
I guess the difference is no,

2784
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:33,450
there was no law that he could fire him.

2785
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:34,600
You know, there was no,

2786
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,190
like at the end of the, he owned the company.

2787
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:40,920
You know, he had total discretion of his ability to move.

2788
01:43:40,920 --> 01:43:42,870
So I'm not even saying his ideas are bad.

2789
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:45,660
I'm saying that the ability that's,

2790
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:49,050
what makes him such an incredible visionary entrepreneur?

2791
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:53,910
Its movement, its deference at times to the right people,

2792
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:57,360
but also, the knowledge of every individual piece

2793
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,790
of the machine and his ability to come in

2794
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:02,190
and to execute his full vision at any time

2795
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:04,350
and override any of the managers.

2796
01:44:04,350 --> 01:44:05,340
So I talked previously

2797
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:07,260
about the professional managerial class

2798
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:08,730
and the managerial revolution.

2799
01:44:08,730 --> 01:44:10,440
Elon is one of the few people who's ever built

2800
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,820
a multi-billion dollar company

2801
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:14,160
who has not actually fallen victim

2802
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:17,070
to the managerial revolution and against entrepreneurship

2803
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:18,840
and innovation that happens there.

2804
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,780
There are very few people who can do it, Elon, Steve Jobs.

2805
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:24,630
But you know, what do we learn is that unfortunately

2806
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:26,970
after Steve died, Apple basically needs succumb

2807
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:28,380
to the managerial revolution

2808
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:30,930
and has become like the product, you know,

2809
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:33,150
they make all their money by printing services

2810
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:36,060
and making it impossible to leave this ecosystem

2811
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:39,540
as opposed to building the most cool product ever.

2812
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,730
As much as I love my Vision Pro, don't get me wrong.

2813
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:44,190
- I think you just admitted that you're part of a cult.

2814
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:45,023
- I know, I literally am.

2815
01:44:45,023 --> 01:44:47,160
- Yeah. - I am. I'm fully admit it.

2816
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,780
- Yeah. - Yeah. I miss Steve.

2817
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:50,370
- Grass is greener on the other side.

2818
01:44:50,370 --> 01:44:52,590
Come join us. Okay.

2819
01:44:52,590 --> 01:44:54,300
Whether it's Elon or somebody else,

2820
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:57,240
what gives you hope about something like

2821
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,710
a radical transformation of government towards efficiency,

2822
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:03,363
towards being more slim?

2823
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:07,260
What gives you hope that that would be possible?

2824
01:45:07,260 --> 01:45:08,550
- Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

2825
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,520
I don't think slimness in and of itself is a good thing.

2826
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,120
What I care about is the relationship to people

2827
01:45:14,120 --> 01:45:15,150
at its government.

2828
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:18,030
So the biggest problem that we have is that

2829
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:21,120
we have a complete loss of faith in all of our institutions.

2830
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,940
And I really encourage people,

2831
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:26,340
I don't think people can quite understand

2832
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,260
what the relationship between America

2833
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:30,870
and its government was like after World War II

2834
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:32,340
and after FDR,

2835
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:35,370
like 90% of the people trusted the government.

2836
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:36,780
That's crazy.

2837
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:38,280
Like when the president said something,

2838
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:41,010
they were like, okay, he's not lying.

2839
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:44,340
Think about our cynical attitude towards politicians today.

2840
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:45,660
That is largely the fault

2841
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:47,850
of Lyndon Johnson and of Richard Nixon.

2842
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:50,880
And that entire fallout period of Vietnam.

2843
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,670
Vietnam in particular really broke the American character

2844
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:56,250
and its ability and its relationship with government.

2845
01:45:56,250 --> 01:45:57,510
And we've never recovered

2846
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:59,340
faith in institutions ever since that.

2847
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,630
And it's really unfortunate.

2848
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:02,610
So what makes me hopeful,

2849
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:05,550
at least this time is anytime a president wins

2850
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:08,700
a popular vote and an election is they have the ability

2851
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:11,640
to reset and to actually try and build something

2852
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:12,870
that is new.

2853
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:16,440
And so what I would hope is that this is different

2854
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:20,280
from the first Trump administration in which the mandate

2855
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:24,930
for Donald Trump is actually carried out competently.

2856
01:46:24,930 --> 01:46:27,660
Yes, he can do his antics, which got him elected.

2857
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,070
You know, at this point we can't deny it.

2858
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:32,010
McDonald's thing is hilarious, it's funny, well, it is.

2859
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:33,150
People love it.

2860
01:46:33,150 --> 01:46:34,530
People like the podcasting.

2861
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:36,000
People like- - Garbage truck.

2862
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,350
- The garbage truck. Yeah, exactly.

2863
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:39,720
They like the stunts and he will always excel

2864
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:41,760
and he will continue to do that.

2865
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,010
There are policy and other things that he can and should do

2866
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:45,480
like the pursuit of no war,

2867
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,210
like solving the immigration question

2868
01:46:48,210 --> 01:46:51,900
and also, really figuring out our economy

2869
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:54,960
the way that it currently runs and changing it

2870
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:59,460
so that the actual American dream is more achievable.

2871
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,920
And housing is one of the chief problems

2872
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,270
that we have right now.

2873
01:47:03,270 --> 01:47:05,220
The real thing is Donald Trump was elected

2874
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:06,570
on the backs of the working man.

2875
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:07,800
I mean, it's just true.

2876
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,470
Households under $100,000 voted for Donald Trump.

2877
01:47:10,470 --> 01:47:12,060
Maybe they didn't do so for economic reasons.

2878
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:13,780
I think a lot of them did for economic,

2879
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:16,200
a lot of them did for immigration, for cultural,

2880
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,670
but you still owe them something.

2881
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:19,440
And there is a,

2882
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,660
I would hope that they could carry something out

2883
01:47:21,660 --> 01:47:25,665
in that respect that is not a similar continuation

2884
01:47:25,665 --> 01:47:27,270
and chaotic vibe of the first time

2885
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:29,620
where everything felt like it exploded any time

2886
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:33,930
with staffing, with even his policy or what he cared about

2887
01:47:33,930 --> 01:47:35,277
or his ability to pursue.

2888
01:47:35,277 --> 01:47:37,590
And a lot of that does come back to personnel.

2889
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:39,450
So I'm concerned in some respects,

2890
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:42,060
I'm like, you know, not thrilled in some respects

2891
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:43,620
I'm happy in some respects,

2892
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:46,710
but it remains to be seen how he's gonna do it.

2893
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:49,478
- To the degree it's possible to see Trumpism

2894
01:47:49,478 --> 01:47:51,480
and MAGA as a coherent ideology.

2895
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:54,330
What do you think are the central pillars of it?

2896
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:57,930
- MAGA is a rejection of cultural elitism.

2897
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,010
That's what I would say.

2898
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:03,570
Cultural elitism though has many different categories.

2899
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:05,160
Immigration is one, right,

2900
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:06,480
is that cultural elitism

2901
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:09,360
and cultural liberalism has a fundamental belief

2902
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,910
that immigration in and of itself is a natural good

2903
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:13,260
at any and all levels.

2904
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:15,600
That all immigrants are like replacement level,

2905
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,580
that there is no difference between them.

2906
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:21,660
Cultural elitism in a foreign policy context comes back

2907
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:25,260
to a lot of that human rights democracy stuff

2908
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:26,460
that I was talking about earlier,

2909
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:28,350
which divorces American values

2910
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:30,000
from American interests and says

2911
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,540
that actually American values are American interests.

2912
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:37,500
Cultural elitism and liberalism leads to the worship

2913
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:39,570
of the postal rights era of bureaucracy

2914
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:41,310
that I talked about from those two books

2915
01:48:41,310 --> 01:48:43,260
of DEI of quote unquote "woke"

2916
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:45,960
and of progressive social ideology.

2917
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:48,930
So I would put all those together

2918
01:48:48,930 --> 01:48:51,810
as ultimately what MAGA is.

2919
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:54,030
It is a screw you.

2920
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:56,910
I once drove past, it was in rural Nevada,

2921
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,010
and I was driving and I drove past

2922
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:01,020
the biggest sign I've ever seen,

2923
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:02,370
political sign to this day.

2924
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:03,477
And it's just, it was in 2020

2925
01:49:03,477 --> 01:49:06,720
and just said, "Trump, fuck your feelings."

2926
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,553
And I still believe

2927
01:49:07,553 --> 01:49:10,770
that is the most coherent MAGA thing I've ever seen.

2928
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:12,570
Because everyone's always like,

2929
01:49:12,570 --> 01:49:17,570
how can a neocon and Tulsi Gabbard and RFK

2930
01:49:17,687 --> 01:49:18,520
and all these other people,

2931
01:49:18,520 --> 01:49:21,540
how can they all exist under the same umbrella?

2932
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:22,860
And I'm like, it's very simple.

2933
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:25,199
All of them have rejected the cultural elite

2934
01:49:25,199 --> 01:49:27,450
in their own way certainly,

2935
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:29,490
but they've arrived at the same place.

2936
01:49:29,490 --> 01:49:30,750
It's an umbrella

2937
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:32,610
and it's an umbrella fundamentally,

2938
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:35,107
which has nothing to do with the status quo

2939
01:49:35,107 --> 01:49:36,540
and with the, you know,

2940
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:39,150
currently established cultural elite,

2941
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:40,230
that doesn't mean they're not elite

2942
01:49:40,230 --> 01:49:41,640
and they're not rich in their own regards,

2943
01:49:41,640 --> 01:49:42,960
that doesn't mean they don't disagree,

2944
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,510
but that's the one thing that unites the entire party.

2945
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:46,950
And so that's the way I would put it.

2946
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:49,410
- Anti-cultural elite.

2947
01:49:49,410 --> 01:49:51,900
Is that synonymous with anti-establishment?

2948
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:54,480
So basic distrust of all institutions.

2949
01:49:54,480 --> 01:49:56,790
Is elitism connected to institutions?

2950
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:57,810
- Yes, absolutely.

2951
01:49:57,810 --> 01:50:00,840
Because elites are the ones who runs our institutions.

2952
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,870
That said anti-establishment is really not the right word

2953
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:05,640
because there are a lot of left-wingers

2954
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:07,500
who are anti-establishment, right?

2955
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:08,333
They are against that,

2956
01:50:08,333 --> 01:50:10,170
but they're not anti-cultural leftism.

2957
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:12,870
And that's the key distinction between MAGA

2958
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:14,490
and like left populism.

2959
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:17,400
Left populism basically does agree.

2960
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:19,410
They agree with like basic conceits,

2961
01:50:19,410 --> 01:50:23,280
like racism is one of the biggest problem facing America.

2962
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,120
They're like, one of the ways

2963
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:27,180
that we would fix that is through class-oriented

2964
01:50:27,180 --> 01:50:29,550
economic programs in order to address that.

2965
01:50:29,550 --> 01:50:31,800
But we believe in, I don't know,

2966
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:33,870
like reparations as a concept.

2967
01:50:33,870 --> 01:50:35,790
It's just more about how we arrive there.

2968
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:38,160
Whereas in MAGA we would say no,

2969
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,390
we actually don't think that at all.

2970
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:40,860
We think we've evolved past that

2971
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:43,410
and we think that the best way to fix it is,

2972
01:50:43,410 --> 01:50:44,820
actually similar policy prescription.

2973
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:47,190
But the mindset matters a lot.

2974
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:50,040
So the real distinction between MAGA

2975
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:52,560
and like left populism really is on culture.

2976
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,010
Trans in particular, orientation about,

2977
01:50:56,010 --> 01:50:57,960
actually immigration may be the biggest one

2978
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:00,990
because if you look at the history of Bernie Sanders,

2979
01:51:00,990 --> 01:51:02,730
you know, Bernie Sanders was a person

2980
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:04,590
who railed against open borders

2981
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:06,900
and against mass migration for years.

2982
01:51:06,900 --> 01:51:09,450
There are famous interviews of him on YouTube

2983
01:51:09,450 --> 01:51:13,050
with Lou Dobbs, who's one of the hardcore immigration guys,

2984
01:51:13,050 --> 01:51:14,520
and they agree with each other.

2985
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:17,400
And Lou is like, "Bernie's one of the only guys out there,"

2986
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:18,870
Bernie, at the end of the day,

2987
01:51:18,870 --> 01:51:21,180
he had to succumb to the cultural left.

2988
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:24,420
And its changing attitudes on mass immigration.

2989
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:27,397
There's some famous clips from 2015 in a Vox interview

2990
01:51:27,397 --> 01:51:29,310
that he gave where he started,

2991
01:51:29,310 --> 01:51:30,210
I think he started talking about

2992
01:51:30,210 --> 01:51:32,190
how the open borders is a Koch brothers

2993
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:34,440
libertarian concept, right?

2994
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:36,450
Because Bernie is a basically

2995
01:51:36,450 --> 01:51:38,520
of a European welfare state tradition.

2996
01:51:38,520 --> 01:51:42,030
European welfare states are very simply understood.

2997
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:45,540
We have high taxes, high services, low rates of immigration

2998
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:48,030
because we have high taxes and high services,

2999
01:51:48,030 --> 01:51:49,620
we have a limited pool of people

3000
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:51,750
who can experience and take those services.

3001
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:52,870
He used to understand that.

3002
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:55,380
He changed a lot of his attitude.

3003
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:58,260
Bernie also, I will say, look, he's a courageous man

3004
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:59,550
and a courageous politician.

3005
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:01,320
You know, as late as 2017,

3006
01:52:01,320 --> 01:52:03,300
he actually endorsed a pro-life candidate

3007
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:06,510
because he said that that pro-life candidate was,

3008
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:07,350
you know, pro-worker.

3009
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:08,250
And he's like, "At the end of the day,

3010
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:09,840
I care about pro-worker policy."

3011
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:10,707
He took a ton of shit for it

3012
01:52:10,707 --> 01:52:12,240
and I don't think he's done it since.

3013
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:15,360
So the sad part that's really happened is that

3014
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,690
a lot of left populist, you know, agenda,

3015
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:21,360
and other has become subsumed, you know,

3016
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:25,080
in the hysteria around cultural leftism wokeism,

3017
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:26,580
whatever the hell you wanna call it.

3018
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:29,550
And that ultimately that cultural leftism was the thing

3019
01:52:29,550 --> 01:52:32,400
that really united, you know, the two wings of that party.

3020
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,580
And that's really why MAGA is very opposed to that.

3021
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:36,570
They're really not the same,

3022
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:39,390
but the left populist can still be anti-establishment.

3023
01:52:39,390 --> 01:52:40,650
That's the key.

3024
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:42,990
- It's interesting to think of the left

3025
01:52:42,990 --> 01:52:47,990
cultural elite subsuming consuming Bernie Sanders,

3026
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:49,200
the left populist.

3027
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:50,550
So you think that's what happened?

3028
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:51,660
- That's what I would say.

3029
01:52:51,660 --> 01:52:54,270
- What do you think happened in 2016 with Bernie?

3030
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:58,050
Is there a possible future where he would've won?

3031
01:52:58,050 --> 01:53:00,750
You and Krystal wrote a book on populism in 2020.

3032
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:04,350
So from that perspective, just looking at 2016,

3033
01:53:04,350 --> 01:53:07,410
if he rejected wokeism at that time,

3034
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:10,023
by the way, that would be pretty gangster June 2016.

3035
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:13,050
Would he have,

3036
01:53:13,050 --> 01:53:17,460
because I think Hillary went towards the left more, right?

3037
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:18,293
Am I remembering that correctly?

3038
01:53:18,293 --> 01:53:19,860
- It was a very weird time.

3039
01:53:19,860 --> 01:53:21,990
So yes and no,

3040
01:53:21,990 --> 01:53:26,610
it wasn't full on BLM mania like it was in 2020,

3041
01:53:26,610 --> 01:53:28,560
but the signs were all there.

3042
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:31,710
So the Great Awokening was in 2014.

3043
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:33,060
I know it's a ridiculous term.

3044
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:33,960
I'm sorry. - I love it.

3045
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:35,605
Please keep saying it. - But-

3046
01:53:35,605 --> 01:53:36,540
- There's a ring to it. - Well, just to give

3047
01:53:36,540 --> 01:53:38,430
the origin, the Great Awakening is about

3048
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:40,380
the great religious revival in the United States.

3049
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:43,350
So people had, you know, because wokeism is a religion,

3050
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:44,610
you know, that's a common refrain.

3051
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,200
They were like, the Great Awokening is a really

3052
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,033
good term so.

3053
01:53:47,033 --> 01:53:48,090
- Thank you for explaining the joke.

3054
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:48,923
Yep. - Yeah.

3055
01:53:48,923 --> 01:53:52,050
So the Great Awokening is basically when racial attitudes

3056
01:53:52,050 --> 01:53:53,730
amongst college educated whites

3057
01:53:53,730 --> 01:53:55,350
basically flipped on its head.

3058
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:58,200
There are a variety of reasons why this happened.

3059
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,570
I really believe that Ta-Nehisi Coates's case

3060
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:02,730
for reparations in the Atlantic is one of those,

3061
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:05,250
it radicalized an entire generation

3062
01:54:05,250 --> 01:54:07,950
of basically like white college educated women

3063
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:10,020
to think completely differently on race.

3064
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:11,580
It was during Ferguson,

3065
01:54:11,580 --> 01:54:13,170
and then it also happened immediately

3066
01:54:13,170 --> 01:54:15,090
after the Trayvon Martin case.

3067
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:18,030
Those two things really set the stage

3068
01:54:18,030 --> 01:54:21,360
for the eventual BLM takeover of 2020.

3069
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:23,700
But fundamentally what they did is they changed

3070
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:26,130
racial attitudes amongst college educated elites

3071
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:28,650
to really think in a race first construct.

3072
01:54:28,650 --> 01:54:32,520
And worse is that they were rejected in 2016

3073
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,890
at the ballot box by the election of Donald Trump.

3074
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:37,200
And in response, they ramped it up

3075
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:39,630
because they believed that that was the framework

3076
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:40,463
to view the world.

3077
01:54:40,463 --> 01:54:42,720
That people voted for Trump because he was racist

3078
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:44,730
and not for a variety of other reasons

3079
01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:45,720
that they eventually did.

3080
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:49,500
And so the point around this on question

3081
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:52,650
of whether Bernie could have won in 2016, I don't know,

3082
01:54:52,650 --> 01:54:56,580
Krystal seems to think so, I'm skeptical.

3083
01:54:56,580 --> 01:54:58,530
I'm skeptical for a variety of reasons.

3084
01:54:58,530 --> 01:55:00,690
I think the culture is honestly one of them.

3085
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:04,110
One of Trump's core issues in 2016 was immigration.

3086
01:55:04,110 --> 01:55:06,840
And Bernie and him did not agree on immigration.

3087
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:10,110
And if immigration, you know, even if people did, you know,

3088
01:55:10,110 --> 01:55:11,520
support Bernie Sanders and his vision

3089
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,860
for working class people like the debates

3090
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:16,470
and the understanding about what it would look like,

3091
01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:18,450
like a healthcare system which literally would pay

3092
01:55:18,450 --> 01:55:20,250
for illegal immigrants,

3093
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:22,527
I think he would've gotten killed on that.

3094
01:55:22,527 --> 01:55:24,030
But I could be wrong, I honestly,

3095
01:55:24,030 --> 01:55:26,070
I will never know, you know what that looked like.

3096
01:55:26,070 --> 01:55:28,590
- Let me reference you from earlier

3097
01:55:28,590 --> 01:55:30,390
in the conversation with FDR.

3098
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:31,770
It's not the policy.

3099
01:55:31,770 --> 01:55:35,700
I think if he went more anti-establishment

3100
01:55:35,700 --> 01:55:40,650
and more populist as opposed to trying to court,

3101
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:42,840
trying to be friendly with the DNC.

3102
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,300
- Yeah, I mean, that's a good counterfactual.

3103
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,280
Nobody will really know.

3104
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:51,270
Look, I have a lot of love for the Bernie 2016 campaign.

3105
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:53,820
He has a great ad from 2016 called "America."

3106
01:55:53,820 --> 01:55:55,590
You should watch it, it's a great ad.

3107
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:56,820
That's another very interesting thing.

3108
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:58,800
It's unapologetically patriotic

3109
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:01,050
and that is not something that you see

3110
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:03,000
in a lot of left-wing circles these days.

3111
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,060
So he understood politics at a base level

3112
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,980
that a lot of people did not.

3113
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:10,170
But you know, Bernie himself,

3114
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:13,050
and then a lot of the Bernie movement was basically crushed

3115
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:16,260
by the elite Democratic Party for a variety of reasons.

3116
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:17,093
They hated them.

3117
01:56:17,093 --> 01:56:17,926
You know, they basically,

3118
01:56:17,926 --> 01:56:20,130
they attacked Joe Rogan for even having him on

3119
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:23,490
and for giving him a platform that was ridiculous.

3120
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:26,610
Obviously, it backfired their face, which is really funny.

3121
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:29,580
There is, but there were a lot of million examples

3122
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:31,500
like that, you know, when they attacked Bernie

3123
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:34,020
for endorsing a pro-life politician,

3124
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:35,190
he never did it again.

3125
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:36,630
They attacked Bernie for run,

3126
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:38,010
for having Bernie bros,

3127
01:56:38,010 --> 01:56:41,490
you know, people online, the bros who were Super Bro Bernie.

3128
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:42,540
And it was his fault.

3129
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:46,020
His supporters would say nasty things about Elizabeth Warren

3130
01:56:46,020 --> 01:56:47,700
and he would like defend straight himself

3131
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:50,160
and be like, "Yes, I'm sorry, you know, please my bro."

3132
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:51,570
He was like, "stop that."

3133
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:54,030
- I think that his biggest problem is he never went

3134
01:56:54,030 --> 01:56:56,890
full Trump, like he didn't go,

3135
01:56:56,890 --> 01:56:58,500
like he kept saying sorry.

3136
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,120
- Yeah, I agree. I totally agree.

3137
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,350
It, actually, in 2020,

3138
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:03,360
I did a ton of analysis on this at the time.

3139
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,680
He would always do stuff like, "Joe Biden, my friend."

3140
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:08,310
And it's like, no, he's not your friend.

3141
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:09,870
He stands for everything

3142
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:10,890
that you disagree with. - Yeah.

3143
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:11,790
- Everything.

3144
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:13,500
He'd be like, "Yeah, he's a nice guy,

3145
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:14,970
but he's not my friend."

3146
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:17,520
But he would always be like, "Joe and I are great friends,

3147
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,220
but you know, we have a small disagreement on this,"

3148
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:21,510
but you know, like you just said,

3149
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:22,980
in terms of going full Trump,

3150
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:25,710
they wanted to see Trump up there humiliating

3151
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:26,883
all of the GOP politicians

3152
01:57:26,883 --> 01:57:28,440
that they didn't trust anymore.

3153
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,880
That's what people really wanted.

3154
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:33,000
But the other side of this is that the Democratic base

3155
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,610
in 2020 was very different than 2016

3156
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:38,820
because by 2020 they full on had TDS

3157
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:40,800
and they were basically like,

3158
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,070
we need to defeat Trump at all costs.

3159
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:46,170
We don't give a shit what your name is,

3160
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:48,690
Bernie, Biden, whatever,

3161
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:51,660
whichever of you is gonna best defeat Trump,

3162
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:52,860
you get the knob.

3163
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,880
2016 is different

3164
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,400
because they didn't full on have that

3165
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,040
like love and necessity of winning.

3166
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,750
By the way, this is a strategic advantage

3167
01:58:00,750 --> 01:58:02,550
that the Democrats have.

3168
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:03,990
Democrats just care about winning,

3169
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:05,730
the current base of the party.

3170
01:58:05,730 --> 01:58:06,840
All they wanna do is win.

3171
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:08,760
Republican base, they don't give a shit about winning.

3172
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:09,660
They just love Trump.

3173
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:11,310
So it's nice to win.

3174
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:15,810
But one of those where they will express their id

3175
01:58:15,810 --> 01:58:17,250
for what they really want.

3176
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:18,870
Now it's worked out for them because it turns out

3177
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:21,000
that's a very palpable political force.

3178
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,220
But one of the reasons why, you know,

3179
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:26,077
you won't see me up here doing James Carville,

3180
01:58:26,077 --> 01:58:27,300
"40 More Years,"

3181
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:29,370
is there is a law of something called

3182
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:30,990
thermostatic public opinion,

3183
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:33,690
where, you know, the thermostat,

3184
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:36,360
it changes a lot whenever you actually,

3185
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:38,130
so when you have a left-wing president in power,

3186
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:39,120
the country goes right.

3187
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:40,410
When you have a right-wing president in power,

3188
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:41,370
the country goes left.

3189
01:58:41,370 --> 01:58:42,660
Amazing, right?

3190
01:58:42,660 --> 01:58:44,430
You can actually look at a graph

3191
01:58:44,430 --> 01:58:47,610
of economic attitudes from the two months

3192
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:50,160
where Joe Biden became president after Donald Trump.

3193
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:51,660
So Republicans, Trump was president

3194
01:58:51,660 --> 01:58:53,730
of the last year in office, economy's great,

3195
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:56,040
two months later, the economy is horrible.

3196
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:59,610
That is a perfect example of thermostatic opinion.

3197
01:58:59,610 --> 01:59:01,800
And I'm not counting these Democrats out.

3198
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:05,160
2004, George W. Bush wins the popular vote.

3199
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,860
He has a historic mandate to continue in Iraq

3200
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:09,552
by '06, he's toasted.

3201
01:59:09,552 --> 01:59:11,730
We have a massive midterm election,

3202
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:13,767
and by '08, we're writing books about 40 more years

3203
01:59:13,767 --> 01:59:15,480
and how there's never gonna be Republican

3204
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:16,710
in office ever again.

3205
01:59:16,710 --> 01:59:19,410
So things can change a lot in a very short period of time.

3206
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:22,560
- I think also for me personally, maybe I'm deluded,

3207
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,080
sort of the great man view of history.

3208
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:27,780
I think some of it, it's in programming circles,

3209
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:29,610
the term skills issue.

3210
01:59:29,610 --> 01:59:33,150
I think some of it just has to do how good you are,

3211
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:35,880
how charismatic you are, how good you are as a politician.

3212
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,560
I, maybe, you disagree with this.

3213
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:39,030
I'd love to see what you think.

3214
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:42,300
I think if Obama, if you were allowed to run for many terms,

3215
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:43,920
I think Obama would just keep winning.

3216
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:46,830
He would win 2016, he would win 2020,

3217
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:49,050
he would win this year, 2024.

3218
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:50,970
- It's possible, but I would flip it on you

3219
01:59:50,970 --> 01:59:52,770
and I would say Obama would never be elected

3220
01:59:52,770 --> 01:59:54,150
if there were no term limits

3221
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:55,517
because Bill Clinton would've still been president.

3222
01:59:55,517 --> 01:59:56,350
- Right. - Yeah.

3223
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:57,744
- So, well those two, right? - Yeah. Yeah.

3224
01:59:57,744 --> 01:59:59,880
- Those two examples of exactly,

3225
01:59:59,880 --> 02:00:03,540
they, extremely skilled politicians

3226
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:07,830
and somehow can appear like populists.

3227
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:10,860
- Man, Bill Clinton was a force in his time.

3228
02:00:10,860 --> 02:00:13,260
And it's honestly sad what's happened to him.

3229
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,240
I was actually just talking with a friend the other day.

3230
02:00:15,240 --> 02:00:16,530
I'm like, I kind of don't think

3231
02:00:16,530 --> 02:00:18,690
that presidents should become president when they're young

3232
02:00:18,690 --> 02:00:22,620
because they live to see themselves become irrelevant.

3233
02:00:22,620 --> 02:00:24,180
And that must be really painful.

3234
02:00:24,180 --> 02:00:25,013
- Yeah. - Because I know

3235
02:00:25,013 --> 02:00:27,120
what it takes to get there.

3236
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:29,130
Imagine being Clinton, I mean,

3237
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:30,990
your entire legacy was destroyed

3238
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:33,210
with Hillary Clinton in 2016.

3239
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:36,420
And then imagine being Obama, who in 2016,

3240
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:38,040
you could argue it's a one-off

3241
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:40,860
and say that Trump is just, oh, Hillary was a bad candidate,

3242
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:45,480
but Michelle and Barack Obama went so hard for Kamala Harris

3243
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:47,220
and they just got blown out in the popular vote.

3244
02:00:47,220 --> 02:00:49,350
I mean, the Obama era officially ended

3245
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:51,970
with Donald Trump's reelection to the presidency in 2024.

3246
02:00:51,970 --> 02:00:54,480
And that was a 20-year period

3247
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:57,060
where Obama was one of the most popular central figures

3248
02:00:57,060 --> 02:00:58,374
in American politics.

3249
02:00:58,374 --> 02:01:00,450
But I wanna return to what you're saying

3250
02:01:00,450 --> 02:01:02,100
because it is important, and by the way,

3251
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:04,680
I do not support term limits on American presidents.

3252
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:05,513
- Are you a fascist?

3253
02:01:05,513 --> 02:01:07,110
- Well, that would imply,

3254
02:01:07,110 --> 02:01:09,540
that would imply that I don't believe in democracy.

3255
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,220
I actually do believe in democracy

3256
02:01:11,220 --> 02:01:13,860
because I think the people, if they love their president,

3257
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:15,270
should be able to reelect him.

3258
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:17,070
I think FDR was amazing.

3259
02:01:17,070 --> 02:01:20,220
I think that the term limit change was a,

3260
02:01:20,220 --> 02:01:22,620
basically what happened is,

3261
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:25,260
is that Republicans and a lot of elite Democrats

3262
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:28,320
always wanted to speak against FDR, but he was a God.

3263
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,020
So they couldn't, so they waited until he died,

3264
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:33,000
and then after he died, they were like, yeah,

3265
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,550
this whole third, fourth term, that can never happen again.

3266
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:38,517
And America didn't really think that hard about it,

3267
02:01:38,517 --> 02:01:40,410
but they were like, yeah, okay, whatever.

3268
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:43,020
But I mean, it had immense consequences

3269
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:44,460
for American history.

3270
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:46,380
Clinton is the perfect example.

3271
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:47,400
I mean, just-

3272
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:48,690
Bill Clinton left office,

3273
02:01:48,690 --> 02:01:50,370
even despite the Lewinsky bullshit,

3274
02:01:50,370 --> 02:01:52,650
he had a 60% approval rating.

3275
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:56,910
Okay, no way George W. Bush gets elected, impossible.

3276
02:01:56,910 --> 02:01:58,650
Clinton would've blown his ass out.

3277
02:01:58,650 --> 02:02:00,810
And imagine the consequences of that.

3278
02:02:00,810 --> 02:02:02,340
We would've no Iraq.

3279
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:03,960
I mean, I'm not saying he was a great man,

3280
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:06,375
like we probably still would've had the financial crisis

3281
02:02:06,375 --> 02:02:08,670
and there's still a lot of bad stuff that would've happened.

3282
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:09,900
But he was a popular dude.

3283
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:10,733
And you know,

3284
02:02:10,733 --> 02:02:13,320
I wouldn't say he had the best judgment at times,

3285
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:16,230
presidentially, not personally, definitely not personally,

3286
02:02:16,230 --> 02:02:17,610
but you know, presidentially.

3287
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:19,950
But I'm pretty confident we would've not gone

3288
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:21,300
into the Iraq war.

3289
02:02:21,300 --> 02:02:23,370
And so that's where it really cost us.

3290
02:02:23,370 --> 02:02:25,590
If you're left-wing and you're talking about Obama, yeah,

3291
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:28,380
I think Obama probably would've won in 2016,

3292
02:02:28,380 --> 02:02:31,080
although it's a counterfactual.

3293
02:02:31,080 --> 02:02:35,340
Because Obama was never challenged in the same way

3294
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:37,470
that MAGA was able to,

3295
02:02:37,470 --> 02:02:38,790
to the liberal consensus.

3296
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:42,630
Like Romney really ran this like awful campaign, honestly,

3297
02:02:42,630 --> 02:02:43,667
about cutting spending.

3298
02:02:43,667 --> 02:02:45,540
It was very traditional Republican.

3299
02:02:45,540 --> 02:02:46,950
It was deeply unpopular.

3300
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:50,070
The autopsy of that election was,

3301
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:52,050
we actually need to be more pro-immigration.

3302
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:54,030
That literally was the autopsy.

3303
02:02:54,030 --> 02:02:56,850
But Trump understood the assignment.

3304
02:02:56,850 --> 02:02:59,730
There are two people who I so deeply respect

3305
02:02:59,730 --> 02:03:03,060
for their political bets, Peter Thiel and Donald Trump.

3306
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:05,227
So one of the books that I recommended called

3307
02:03:05,227 --> 02:03:07,050
"The Unwinding" by George Packer,

3308
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:08,670
he actually talks about Peter Thiel there,

3309
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:10,380
this is in 2013.

3310
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:13,117
And Thiel talks about, he was like,

3311
02:03:13,117 --> 02:03:15,900
"You know, whoever runs for office next,

3312
02:03:15,900 --> 02:03:18,390
they don't need to run on an optimistic message.

3313
02:03:18,390 --> 02:03:19,680
They need to run on a message

3314
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:22,080
that everything is fucked up and that we need to fix."

3315
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:26,190
And if you think about, that's why Thiel's endorsement

3316
02:03:26,190 --> 02:03:29,957
of Trump with the American carnage message is,

3317
02:03:29,957 --> 02:03:33,150
I mean it took, it was shocking, right, at the time.

3318
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:34,800
But he had that fundamental insight

3319
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,690
that that's what the American people wanted.

3320
02:03:36,690 --> 02:03:40,030
Trump too comes out of an election in 2012

3321
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:42,240
where the literal GOP autopsy,

3322
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:43,800
the report produced by the party says,

3323
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,260
we need to be pro mass immigration.

3324
02:03:46,260 --> 02:03:47,093
What happens?

3325
02:03:47,093 --> 02:03:51,990
Immediately after 2012, they start to go for mass immigrant,

3326
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:54,780
basically they go for like these amnesty plans,

3327
02:03:54,780 --> 02:03:57,210
the so-called Gang of Eight plan, Marco Rubio,

3328
02:03:57,210 --> 02:03:59,700
and all of this in 2013, it falls apart,

3329
02:03:59,700 --> 02:04:04,700
but Republicans get punished by their base in 2014.

3330
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:08,100
So Eric Cantor, who was the House majority leader,

3331
02:04:08,100 --> 02:04:09,270
the number two Republican,

3332
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:10,983
spent more on stake in his campaign

3333
02:04:10,983 --> 02:04:13,453
than his primary opponent who successfully defeated him,

3334
02:04:13,453 --> 02:04:14,640
a guy named Dave Brat.

3335
02:04:14,640 --> 02:04:17,220
Dave Brat kicked his ass on the issue of immigration

3336
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:19,560
and said that Eric Cantor, is pro-amnesty.

3337
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:21,120
All of the forces were there.

3338
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:23,880
And then in 2015, Trump comes down the escalator

3339
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,220
and he gives the message on immigration

3340
02:04:26,220 --> 02:04:29,100
that the GOP base has been roaring and wanting to hear now,

3341
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:31,350
but that nobody wanted to listen to them.

3342
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:33,690
And that was his fundamental insight.

3343
02:04:33,690 --> 02:04:35,520
That bet was a colossal

3344
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,050
and a Titanic political bet

3345
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:40,710
at a time when all political ideology

3346
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:42,270
and thought process would've said

3347
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:43,680
that you should come out on the other side,

3348
02:04:43,680 --> 02:04:46,200
which is where Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz

3349
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,880
and all these other guys were effectively there,

3350
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:50,010
you know, in varying different ways

3351
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:51,540
like they were hawkish or whatever.

3352
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:53,220
But Trump was just so,

3353
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:56,250
had such a monopoly on that as an idea.

3354
02:04:56,250 --> 02:04:58,560
That's why he wins in 2016 primary.

3355
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:00,630
And then paired with immigration,

3356
02:05:00,630 --> 02:05:02,400
a hard line position on immigration,

3357
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,770
is this American carnage idea

3358
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:06,540
that actually everything is wrong.

3359
02:05:06,540 --> 02:05:08,970
The American dream has gone.

3360
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:12,090
You know, we will stop this American carnage.

3361
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:14,118
And I think American carnage is one

3362
02:05:14,118 --> 02:05:16,470
of the most important inaugural speeches ever given

3363
02:05:16,470 --> 02:05:18,300
in American history.

3364
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:20,880
Put it up against every single other speech.

3365
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,500
There's nothing else like it.

3366
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:25,350
But that was what the country wanted at the time.

3367
02:05:25,350 --> 02:05:28,050
And that's what great politicians are able to do,

3368
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:29,700
is they're able to suss something out.

3369
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:32,040
That's also why Peter Thiel is who he is,

3370
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:34,080
because he saw that in 2000.

3371
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:36,047
Imagine, you know, what it takes to come out

3372
02:05:36,047 --> 02:05:37,737
of the 2012 election to be,

3373
02:05:37,737 --> 02:05:40,620
and to be honestly totally contrarian

3374
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:41,820
to the entire national mood

3375
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:45,000
and this entire theory of Obama-esque star politics

3376
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:46,770
and say, no, you need somebody

3377
02:05:46,770 --> 02:05:49,230
who runs on the opposite of that to win.

3378
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:50,310
- Well, we'll never know.

3379
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:53,400
And I love this kind of Mike Tyson versus Muhammad Ali.

3380
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:56,670
I still think I would've loved to see Obama versus Trump.

3381
02:05:56,670 --> 02:05:57,960
- Me too. I agree.

3382
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:01,830
- And first of all, Obama versus Trump in 2008,

3383
02:06:01,830 --> 02:06:03,390
Obama wins hands down.

3384
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:04,820
- Well, yes, definitely.

3385
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:07,200
- So this is, I love how this is a boxing talk.

3386
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:09,330
- Yeah. - Now when 2016,

3387
02:06:09,330 --> 02:06:12,030
Obama has a bunch of,

3388
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:14,190
you know, Iraq and Afghanistan.

3389
02:06:14,190 --> 02:06:15,840
- He's vulnerable though, I'll tell you why.

3390
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:17,490
DACA, that's what nobody ever talks about

3391
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:18,660
in the Obama Trump thing.

3392
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:22,170
Don't forget Obama takes his 2012 victory.

3393
02:06:22,170 --> 02:06:24,930
Basically says, "Oh, the GOP even now agrees

3394
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:26,010
with me on immigration."

3395
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:28,320
And then he does DACA and he legalizes,

3396
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,120
you know, X million in a number

3397
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:32,130
of illegal immigrants who are here,

3398
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:33,630
who are brought here as children.

3399
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:35,730
That also fundamentally changed

3400
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:38,130
the immigration consensus on the Republican side,

3401
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:39,840
'cause they were like, "Wait, holy shit,

3402
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:41,040
you can just do that?

3403
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,990
because we don't agree with that at all."

3404
02:06:42,990 --> 02:06:44,880
And that really ignited the base as well.

3405
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,610
So I'm not sure, I mean, a moment I think about a lot

3406
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:52,320
with Trump and just like being able to unleash the rage

3407
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:55,050
of the Republican bases, in the 2012 debate,

3408
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:57,600
Candy Crowley was the moderator with Mitt Romney

3409
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,610
And she fact-check him famously.

3410
02:06:59,610 --> 02:07:02,430
This was when fact checking was shocking in a present.

3411
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:05,490
And she said something about Benghazi

3412
02:07:05,490 --> 02:07:07,320
and she was like, "No, he did say that,"

3413
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:09,990
she like corrected Romney on behalf of Obama

3414
02:07:09,990 --> 02:07:12,840
to this day it's questionable whether she was even right.

3415
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:15,480
But, and Romney was just like, "Oh, he did? Okay."

3416
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:17,840
Trump would've been like, "Excuse me, excuse me."

3417
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:19,530
Be like, "Look at this woman."

3418
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:21,000
And you know, he would've gone off.

3419
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,460
And I was like, and I think about that moment

3420
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:26,910
because that's what the Republican base wanted to hear.

3421
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:29,280
But also, it turns out America had a lot

3422
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,470
of festering feelings about the mainstream media

3423
02:07:31,470 --> 02:07:33,390
that it needed unleashed.

3424
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:36,660
And Trump was just this incredible vector

3425
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:38,820
to just blow up this system.

3426
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:40,650
Which, I mean, if you ask me about optimism,

3427
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:41,483
that's the thing

3428
02:07:41,483 --> 02:07:42,316
I'm most optimism about. - Yeah.

3429
02:07:42,316 --> 02:07:44,250
Don't you think Obama had a good sense

3430
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:45,870
in how to turn it on?

3431
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:47,760
How to be anti-establishment correctly?

3432
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:48,593
- I will not deny

3433
02:07:48,593 --> 02:07:50,250
that he's one of the most talented politicians, literally,

3434
02:07:50,250 --> 02:07:51,600
to ever play the game.

3435
02:07:51,600 --> 02:07:55,920
And he is, I mean, just unbelievable rhetorical talent.

3436
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:57,000
Look, as a counterfactual,

3437
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,260
would he be in more talented than Hillary?

3438
02:07:58,260 --> 02:07:59,613
Yeah. Okay. No question.

3439
02:08:00,750 --> 02:08:03,360
In terms of anybody would've been for that one.

3440
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,600
But at the same time, all the signs were there.

3441
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:08,640
All the signs for the Trump victory

3442
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:11,130
and for the backlash against Obama-ism

3443
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:12,780
kind of as a political project.

3444
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:13,650
It all existed.

3445
02:08:13,650 --> 02:08:14,483
You know, the tea,

3446
02:08:14,483 --> 02:08:16,290
if you like, I just laid the tea leaves out there

3447
02:08:16,290 --> 02:08:18,990
from 2012 to 2015,

3448
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:21,210
in retrospect, it's the most predictable thing in the world

3449
02:08:21,210 --> 02:08:22,590
that Donald Trump will get elected.

3450
02:08:22,590 --> 02:08:23,790
But it was crazy in the moment,

3451
02:08:23,790 --> 02:08:24,623
I got to live through that,

3452
02:08:24,623 --> 02:08:27,210
which was really fun, like professionally.

3453
02:08:27,210 --> 02:08:30,010
- I think it's unfortunate that he kind of

3454
02:08:30,990 --> 02:08:33,453
let Kamala Harris borrow his reputation.

3455
02:08:33,453 --> 02:08:36,575
- Oh it's, I mean it's like, you know better, dude.

3456
02:08:36,575 --> 02:08:37,890
You know.

3457
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:39,070
You defeated these people.

3458
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:41,250
- Yeah. - The Clinton machine,

3459
02:08:41,250 --> 02:08:42,630
you destroyed them

3460
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:44,490
and it was awesome in '08.

3461
02:08:44,490 --> 02:08:45,584
- What is that?

3462
02:08:45,584 --> 02:08:46,920
Why do you,

3463
02:08:46,920 --> 02:08:47,753
why did he,

3464
02:08:47,753 --> 02:08:51,124
like, he's so much bigger and better than the machine.

3465
02:08:51,124 --> 02:08:52,134
- I don't get it. - It's interesting, right?

3466
02:08:52,134 --> 02:08:53,640
- Yeah. It's so weird though.

3467
02:08:53,640 --> 02:08:54,930
I just think- - I think this was

3468
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:55,763
a wake up call,

3469
02:08:55,763 --> 02:08:56,850
2024 was a wake up call.

3470
02:08:56,850 --> 02:08:59,040
Like the DNC machine doesn't work.

3471
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:00,660
- Absolutely, I mean- - There needs to be

3472
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:03,690
new blood, new candidate, new Obama-like candidates.

3473
02:09:03,690 --> 02:09:04,523
- Well, I'm glad you brought that up.

3474
02:09:04,523 --> 02:09:06,990
'Cause that's important too, in terms of the process,

3475
02:09:06,990 --> 02:09:08,790
and the way that things currently stand.

3476
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:12,300
The DNC actually rigged its entire primary system

3477
02:09:12,300 --> 02:09:15,000
under Biden way to the,

3478
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,920
not to the benefit of Obama.

3479
02:09:16,920 --> 02:09:18,690
So for example, you know how they moved away

3480
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:20,130
from the Iowa caucuses

3481
02:09:20,130 --> 02:09:22,260
and they actually moved some other primaries

3482
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:25,890
and moved the calendar to reward traditional states

3483
02:09:25,890 --> 02:09:27,120
that vote much more in line

3484
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:28,500
with the Democratic establishment.

3485
02:09:28,500 --> 02:09:31,290
So the story of Barack Obama is one that not many,

3486
02:09:31,290 --> 02:09:32,790
actually, probably a lot of young people today

3487
02:09:32,790 --> 02:09:34,500
don't even remember how it happened.

3488
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:37,560
In 2008, Obama was the underdog, right?

3489
02:09:37,560 --> 02:09:39,270
And actually, here's the critical thing,

3490
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:41,550
Obama was losing with Black people.

3491
02:09:41,550 --> 02:09:42,383
Why?

3492
02:09:42,383 --> 02:09:44,220
Black Democrats simply did not believe

3493
02:09:44,220 --> 02:09:45,990
that white people would vote for a Black guy.

3494
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:49,380
So Barack Obama goes to this white state, Iowa,

3495
02:09:49,380 --> 02:09:51,330
all in on the Iowa caucuses

3496
02:09:51,330 --> 02:09:54,600
and shocks the world by winning the Iowa caucuses.

3497
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:57,570
Overnight, there is a shift in public opinion

3498
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:59,677
amongst the Black population in South Carolina that says,

3499
02:09:59,677 --> 02:10:01,290
"Oh, shit, he actually could win."

3500
02:10:01,290 --> 02:10:03,150
And he comes out and he wins South Carolina.

3501
02:10:03,150 --> 02:10:05,040
And that's basically was near the death now

3502
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,390
for the Hillary Clinton campaign.

3503
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:09,630
The problem is by moving South Carolina up

3504
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:11,070
and by making it first

3505
02:10:11,070 --> 02:10:14,220
along with other more pro-establishment friendly places,

3506
02:10:14,220 --> 02:10:15,090
what do we do?

3507
02:10:15,090 --> 02:10:17,460
We make it so that Barack Obama could never happen again.

3508
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:20,220
We make it so that an older, you know,

3509
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:22,740
base of Democratic Party voters

3510
02:10:22,740 --> 02:10:24,360
who listens to the elites

3511
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:27,930
can never have their assumptions challenged.

3512
02:10:27,930 --> 02:10:30,420
And that's one of the worst things Joe Biden did.

3513
02:10:30,420 --> 02:10:32,010
You know, I talked about his arrogance.

3514
02:10:32,010 --> 02:10:33,000
He was so arrogant,

3515
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,130
he changed the freaking primary system.

3516
02:10:35,130 --> 02:10:37,560
He was so arrogant, he refused to do a debate.

3517
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:39,677
I mean, imagine history.

3518
02:10:39,677 --> 02:10:41,850
How lucky are we, honestly,

3519
02:10:41,850 --> 02:10:44,910
that Joe Biden agreed to do that debate

3520
02:10:44,910 --> 02:10:46,110
with Donald Trump early.

3521
02:10:46,110 --> 02:10:47,970
And again, that was his arrogance.

3522
02:10:47,970 --> 02:10:49,530
I think we're so lucky for it

3523
02:10:49,530 --> 02:10:52,020
because if we hadn't gotten,

3524
02:10:52,020 --> 02:10:55,620
we got to understand as a country how cooked he was

3525
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:57,330
and how fake everything was

3526
02:10:57,330 --> 02:11:00,090
behind the scenes in front of all of our eyes.

3527
02:11:00,090 --> 02:11:01,530
And they tried for three straight years

3528
02:11:01,530 --> 02:11:03,570
to make sure that that would never happen.

3529
02:11:03,570 --> 02:11:07,050
So, I mean, it's still such a crime, honestly,

3530
02:11:07,050 --> 02:11:08,880
against the American people.

3531
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:10,650
- I've been thinking about who I want to talk to

3532
02:11:10,650 --> 02:11:13,967
for three hours and that's why I bring up Obama

3533
02:11:13,967 --> 02:11:18,967
'cause he's probably the number one person on the left.

3534
02:11:19,890 --> 02:11:24,180
I would like to hear, analyze what happened in this election

3535
02:11:24,180 --> 02:11:26,670
and what happened to the United States of America

3536
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:29,520
over the past 20 plus years.

3537
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:31,350
I can't imagine anybody else.

3538
02:11:31,350 --> 02:11:32,850
- Look, if anybody could do it, it'd be you.

3539
02:11:32,850 --> 02:11:35,070
But there are layers upon layers with that man.

3540
02:11:35,070 --> 02:11:37,770
I would love to actually sit with talk with him for real.

3541
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:39,900
- I think it's fair to say

3542
02:11:39,900 --> 02:11:44,190
that we talked about the great man view of history.

3543
02:11:44,190 --> 02:11:47,092
I think you have a psychopath view of history

3544
02:11:47,092 --> 02:11:50,100
where all great leaders are for sure psychopaths.

3545
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:50,933
- Not for sure.

3546
02:11:50,933 --> 02:11:52,380
There are many who are good people, Harry Truman was-

3547
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:53,213
- You're like some

3548
02:11:53,213 --> 02:11:54,046
of my best friends. - Yeah.

3549
02:11:54,046 --> 02:11:55,072
Some- - Harry Truman.

3550
02:11:55,072 --> 02:11:57,472
Harry Truman, okay. - I assume are good people.

3551
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,330
To be fair though, (Lex laughing)

3552
02:12:00,330 --> 02:12:03,420
most of the good ones are accidents like Harry Truman.

3553
02:12:03,420 --> 02:12:04,650
He never would've gotten himself elected.

3554
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:05,610
He was a great dude.

3555
02:12:05,610 --> 02:12:07,230
- How do you know he's a great dude?

3556
02:12:07,230 --> 02:12:08,400
- David McCullough book,

3557
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:09,984
I highly recommended everybody should read it.

3558
02:12:09,984 --> 02:12:11,700
Truman loved his wife.

3559
02:12:11,700 --> 02:12:12,570
I think that's really awesome.

3560
02:12:12,570 --> 02:12:13,980
I love when politicians love their wife.

3561
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:15,240
It's so rare.

3562
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:17,160
He adored his wife,

3563
02:12:17,160 --> 02:12:20,010
he adored his daughter, spent time with them.

3564
02:12:20,010 --> 02:12:22,380
He made family life a priority.

3565
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:25,080
He had really good small town judgment

3566
02:12:25,080 --> 02:12:27,240
that he would apply to foreign affairs.

3567
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:31,590
He was just a very well considered, very standup man.

3568
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:34,050
And I so appreciate that about him.

3569
02:12:34,050 --> 02:12:35,430
Another one is John Adams.

3570
02:12:35,430 --> 02:12:36,990
I love and revere John Adams.

3571
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:38,580
He's my favorite Founding Father.

3572
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:39,660
Him and John Quincy,

3573
02:12:39,660 --> 02:12:42,570
they don't get nearly enough of their due.

3574
02:12:42,570 --> 02:12:46,110
They were some of the most intelligent, well-considered,

3575
02:12:46,110 --> 02:12:49,200
they were family men that he, you know,

3576
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:51,030
the love, the relationship between

3577
02:12:51,030 --> 02:12:53,280
John and Abigail Adams is literally legendary.

3578
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:54,300
And I think it's amazing, you know,

3579
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:56,160
especially in the context of the 1700s,

3580
02:12:56,160 --> 02:12:58,500
the way that he would take her counsel

3581
02:12:58,500 --> 02:13:02,430
and into conversations and her own ability.

3582
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:04,410
And she would sit there and go toe to toe

3583
02:13:04,410 --> 02:13:06,450
as much with Thomas Jefferson.

3584
02:13:06,450 --> 02:13:07,800
There are some who are great,

3585
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:10,440
who are really, really good presidents,

3586
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:11,610
who have good judgment

3587
02:13:11,610 --> 02:13:13,170
and who are really good people

3588
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:15,240
and really think deeply about the world

3589
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:17,160
and have really cool personal lives.

3590
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:19,140
But there's also the vast majority of them,

3591
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:20,850
especially in the, I would say,

3592
02:13:20,850 --> 02:13:23,160
especially in the modern era

3593
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:25,380
and where the price of the presidency extracts

3594
02:13:25,380 --> 02:13:27,150
everything that you have.

3595
02:13:27,150 --> 02:13:28,050
You have to be able to,

3596
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:31,410
you have to be willing to give everything and it's just,

3597
02:13:31,410 --> 02:13:33,960
that's not a price that most people wanna pay.

3598
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:36,990
- Is it possible that some of the people

3599
02:13:36,990 --> 02:13:39,810
who you think are sociopaths in politics are in fact

3600
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:41,130
really good people?

3601
02:13:41,130 --> 02:13:44,100
And some of the people you think are good, like Truman-

3602
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:45,780
- Yeah, - And Adams

3603
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:46,920
are actually sociopaths?

3604
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:48,210
- Definitely, I mean, I could just be reading

3605
02:13:48,210 --> 02:13:49,350
the wrong books, right?

3606
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:50,430
- Yeah, that's right. - Yeah.

3607
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:51,820
Yeah. - It sounds like you're-

3608
02:13:51,820 --> 02:13:53,130
- Yeah. - You just read

3609
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:55,080
some really compelling biographies.

3610
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:57,690
- Well, okay, to be fair, I don't base this on one book.

3611
02:13:57,690 --> 02:14:00,180
I read a lot of them, and I'll get like a,

3612
02:14:00,180 --> 02:14:02,460
for example, I've read books about LBJ,

3613
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:04,170
you wouldn't know any of his foibles,

3614
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:05,820
but then you find out that they're written

3615
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:07,860
by his friend or, you know, it was written by,

3616
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:08,850
and you read it through- - I just,

3617
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:11,250
I really worry about this kind of general,

3618
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:16,250
especially now the sense of the anti-establishment sense

3619
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:19,650
that every politician must be a sociopath.

3620
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:21,780
Now, while it could,

3621
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:24,549
the reason I worry about that is it feels true.

3622
02:14:24,549 --> 02:14:27,240
- Yeah. - So it's,

3623
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:32,240
you can fall into this bubble of beliefs

3624
02:14:32,580 --> 02:14:34,560
where every politician is a sociopath

3625
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:36,570
and because of that-

3626
02:14:36,570 --> 02:14:37,560
- It can be self-reinforcing.

3627
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:38,880
- Self-reinforcement. - Yeah, I understand

3628
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:39,713
what you're saying.

3629
02:14:39,713 --> 02:14:41,760
I agree by the way, we do need to dramatically change it.

3630
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:42,877
But the problem is, is that,

3631
02:14:42,877 --> 02:14:45,000
you know, people vote with their eyeballs

3632
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:45,960
and with their interests

3633
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:48,030
and people love like to, you know,

3634
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:50,700
dissect people's personal lives.

3635
02:14:50,700 --> 02:14:53,610
And one of the reasons why you were probably more likely

3636
02:14:53,610 --> 02:14:56,070
in the pre-modern era to get a quote unquote "good people"

3637
02:14:56,070 --> 02:14:58,200
is they were not subject to the level of scrutiny

3638
02:14:58,200 --> 02:15:01,500
and to the insanity of the process that you are currently.

3639
02:15:01,500 --> 02:15:02,850
Like I just said about,

3640
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:05,400
I mean, theoretically, you could run for president

3641
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:08,610
and you would just get your nomination at the convention.

3642
02:15:08,610 --> 02:15:10,980
It's only two months to election day, that's not so bad.

3643
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:12,960
But you know, you run for president today,

3644
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:15,660
you got your ass on the road for two years

3645
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:17,610
and then two years before that,

3646
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:19,560
and then you have to run the damn government.

3647
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:23,100
So the price is so extraordinarily high.

3648
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,810
I also think that,

3649
02:15:24,810 --> 02:15:28,080
oh God, and just Washington as a system, it will burn you.

3650
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:28,913
It will just,

3651
02:15:28,913 --> 02:15:31,980
it will extract absolutely everything

3652
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:33,330
that you can give it.

3653
02:15:33,330 --> 02:15:35,670
And at the end of the day, you know,

3654
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:38,310
I mean, everyone always talks about this, it's hilarious,

3655
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:41,490
how Trump is the only president not to age in office.

3656
02:15:41,490 --> 02:15:43,290
I think, I actually think it's crazy.

3657
02:15:43,290 --> 02:15:44,490
Like when you look at the photos

3658
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:46,230
of how he actually looks better today than he did

3659
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:48,060
whenever he went into the office.

3660
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:49,020
That's amazing.

3661
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:52,260
And it actually says a lot about how his mind works.

3662
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:53,910
I think Trump is pure id.

3663
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:56,880
Like I think he's having observed him a little bit

3664
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,470
and you know, both at the White House

3665
02:15:58,470 --> 02:16:00,450
and having interviewed him, it's pure,

3666
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:02,670
just like it's calculating, but it's also pure id,

3667
02:16:02,670 --> 02:16:03,930
which is very interesting.

3668
02:16:03,930 --> 02:16:06,450
The ones who are the thinkers, guys like Obama,

3669
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:08,970
and others who are really in their heads, it's a nightmare.

3670
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:10,320
It's a nightmare.

3671
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:13,170
They will, I mean, apparently Obama would only sleep

3672
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:14,880
four hours a night, you know?

3673
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:16,590
- Yeah, add like some empathy on top of that.

3674
02:16:16,590 --> 02:16:18,360
- Oh. - It's gonna destroy you.

3675
02:16:18,360 --> 02:16:19,980
- It will kill you, man.

3676
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:22,260
- All right, speaking about the dirty game of politics,

3677
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:26,070
several people, different people told me

3678
02:16:26,070 --> 02:16:28,290
that of everyone they have ever met in politics,

3679
02:16:28,290 --> 02:16:31,367
Nancy Pelosi is the best at attaining

3680
02:16:31,367 --> 02:16:33,030
and wielding political power.

3681
02:16:33,030 --> 02:16:34,559
Is there any truth to that?

3682
02:16:34,559 --> 02:16:36,000
- In the modern era? Yeah, I think that's fair.

3683
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,522
In the last 25 years, definitely.

3684
02:16:37,522 --> 02:16:38,670
Let's think about it.

3685
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:39,870
Number one is longevity.

3686
02:16:39,870 --> 02:16:43,110
So she's had the ability to control the caucus

3687
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:44,580
for a long period of time.

3688
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:46,709
So that's impressive because as I just laid out

3689
02:16:46,709 --> 02:16:48,900
with Clinton, Obama, and these figures come and they go,

3690
02:16:48,900 --> 02:16:51,570
but over a 25 almost year period,

3691
02:16:51,570 --> 02:16:53,549
you've been at the very top

3692
02:16:53,549 --> 02:16:55,469
in the center of American politics.

3693
02:16:55,469 --> 02:16:57,209
The other case I would be is that

3694
02:16:57,209 --> 02:17:00,030
in this modern era has been defined by access to money,

3695
02:17:00,030 --> 02:17:01,559
she's one of the greatest fundraisers

3696
02:17:01,559 --> 02:17:02,969
in Democratic Party history.

3697
02:17:02,969 --> 02:17:05,850
And again, consistently, Obama, Kamala,

3698
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:07,020
all those people come and go,

3699
02:17:07,020 --> 02:17:10,590
but she's always had a very central understanding

3700
02:17:10,590 --> 02:17:14,370
of the ability to fundraise, to cultivate good relationships

3701
02:17:14,370 --> 02:17:16,860
with Democratic Party elites all across the country,

3702
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:19,230
used that money and dole it out to her caucus.

3703
02:17:19,230 --> 02:17:23,040
She's also was really good at making sure that legislation

3704
02:17:23,040 --> 02:17:25,830
that came to the floor actually had the votes to do so.

3705
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:28,639
She ran an extremely well-ordered process

3706
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:30,299
in the House of Representatives

3707
02:17:30,299 --> 02:17:33,750
one in which you were able to reconcile like problems

3708
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:34,770
within her office.

3709
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:36,510
It didn't usually go public

3710
02:17:36,510 --> 02:17:37,799
and then it would make it to the floor

3711
02:17:37,799 --> 02:17:40,139
and it would pass so that there would be no general

3712
02:17:40,139 --> 02:17:44,010
like media frenzy and you know, Democrats in disarray

3713
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:44,879
or any of that,

3714
02:17:44,879 --> 02:17:46,680
put that on display with the Republicans,

3715
02:17:46,680 --> 02:17:49,200
and we've had multiple speakers all resign

3716
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:51,389
or get fired in a 16-year period.

3717
02:17:51,389 --> 02:17:52,469
That's pretty remarkable.

3718
02:17:52,469 --> 02:17:55,139
Basically ever since John Boehner decided to leave in,

3719
02:17:55,139 --> 02:17:56,430
what was it, 2012?

3720
02:17:56,430 --> 02:17:57,570
I forget the exact year.

3721
02:17:57,570 --> 02:18:00,540
My point is that if you compare her record

3722
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:03,420
to the longevity on the Republican side, it is astounding.

3723
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:07,020
The other interesting thing is that she also has pulled off,

3724
02:18:07,020 --> 02:18:08,459
one of the real tests

3725
02:18:08,459 --> 02:18:10,422
of political power is can you rule

3726
02:18:10,422 --> 02:18:12,360
even when you don't have the title anymore?

3727
02:18:12,360 --> 02:18:15,480
So she gave up the leader position to Hakeem Jeffries,

3728
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:18,600
but everybody knows she pulled Joe Biden out of the race.

3729
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:20,160
That's pretty interesting, right?

3730
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:22,350
So she's a, technically, just a back bencher,

3731
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:25,590
nobody member of Congress, but we all know that's bullshit.

3732
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:28,020
So that's actually a very important case

3733
02:18:28,020 --> 02:18:31,980
of political power is can you rule without the title?

3734
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:34,469
And if you can, then you truly are powerful.

3735
02:18:34,469 --> 02:18:36,540
So I would make a good case for her.

3736
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:39,629
Yeah, she's done a lot of remarkable stuff for her party.

3737
02:18:39,629 --> 02:18:41,940
I will say they played Trump like a fiddle man.

3738
02:18:41,940 --> 02:18:42,900
Last time around,

3739
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:45,900
they were able to, I mean they really got him.

3740
02:18:45,900 --> 02:18:49,590
One of the craziest elements that I covered was

3741
02:18:49,590 --> 02:18:52,590
during the Trump basically threatened

3742
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:54,147
to shut down the government and actually did shut down

3743
02:18:54,147 --> 02:18:55,889
the government for a period of time

3744
02:18:55,889 --> 02:18:57,959
over a dispute over border wall funding

3745
02:18:57,959 --> 02:18:59,790
and Pelosi and Schumer,

3746
02:18:59,790 --> 02:19:03,570
despite like genuine mass hysteria in the Democratic Party

3747
02:19:03,570 --> 02:19:05,580
with even some people who are willing to try

3748
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:07,049
and to strike a deal,

3749
02:19:07,049 --> 02:19:11,700
never wavered and actually basically won and forced Trump

3750
02:19:11,700 --> 02:19:13,139
to back down.

3751
02:19:13,139 --> 02:19:15,330
Not a lot of MAGA people want to admit it,

3752
02:19:15,330 --> 02:19:17,370
but that was honestly really embarrassing

3753
02:19:17,370 --> 02:19:19,530
for the Trump administration at the time.

3754
02:19:19,530 --> 02:19:22,590
And yeah, I mean the amount of discipline that it took

3755
02:19:22,590 --> 02:19:25,559
for her and for Chuck to a lesser extent,

3756
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:27,959
but for the two of them to pull that off,

3757
02:19:27,959 --> 02:19:30,240
it was honestly impressive that they were able to do that.

3758
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:32,246
Even when the president has so much political power

3759
02:19:32,246 --> 02:19:34,740
and it literally shut down the government over it.

3760
02:19:34,740 --> 02:19:36,690
- Speaking of fundraising,

3761
02:19:36,690 --> 02:19:39,540
Kamala raised $1 billion.

3762
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:40,500
- Insane.

3763
02:19:40,500 --> 02:19:44,459
- But I guess the conclusion is she spent it poorly.

3764
02:19:44,459 --> 02:19:46,143
How would you spend it?

3765
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:48,780
- I don't think money matters that much.

3766
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:50,850
I think Donald Trump has proven to us twice

3767
02:19:50,850 --> 02:19:54,090
that you can win an underdog campaign through earned media.

3768
02:19:54,090 --> 02:19:57,480
And I don't think that paid advertisement moves

3769
02:19:57,480 --> 02:19:58,497
the needle that much.

3770
02:19:58,497 --> 02:20:00,480
Now don't notice, I didn't say that it does matter,

3771
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:05,220
but am I buying $425,000 a day spots on the Vegas sphere?

3772
02:20:05,220 --> 02:20:06,330
No, we're not doing that.

3773
02:20:06,330 --> 02:20:08,580
Are we building? I can't, okay.

3774
02:20:08,580 --> 02:20:10,230
As people who do this for a living,

3775
02:20:10,230 --> 02:20:13,290
how do you even spend $100,000

3776
02:20:13,290 --> 02:20:15,660
to build a set for one interview?

3777
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:17,280
- Is this the Call Her Daddy? - The Call Her Daddy thing.

3778
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:18,840
- Okay. - How's that possible?

3779
02:20:18,840 --> 02:20:21,120
So think about the dollar per hour cost.

3780
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,620
That's like running a jet airplane

3781
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:23,884
in terms of what they did.

3782
02:20:23,884 --> 02:20:25,110
You become- - You know what I wanna note

3783
02:20:25,110 --> 02:20:26,160
behind the scenes?

3784
02:20:26,160 --> 02:20:28,170
- Yeah. - Haven't got,

3785
02:20:28,170 --> 02:20:29,490
and I'm not good with this.

3786
02:20:29,490 --> 02:20:31,500
I get really frustrated and I shouldn't,

3787
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:34,050
but dealing with PR and comms people

3788
02:20:34,050 --> 02:20:35,580
can sometimes break my soul.

3789
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:36,413
- It's maddening.

3790
02:20:36,413 --> 02:20:37,530
Can we not talk about this

3791
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:40,260
and we need to pull them at 2:12 PM,

3792
02:20:40,260 --> 02:20:41,910
and you're like, but that's only 30 minutes.

3793
02:20:41,910 --> 02:20:42,743
You know, it's like.

3794
02:20:42,743 --> 02:20:45,750
- Yeah, that, but there's stuff like,

3795
02:20:45,750 --> 02:20:47,010
like where to put the camera?

3796
02:20:47,010 --> 02:20:48,330
It's not that I don't- - Oh yeah.

3797
02:20:48,330 --> 02:20:50,160
- It's not actually hypothetically,

3798
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:53,490
I don't even disagree with any of the suggestions or,

3799
02:20:53,490 --> 02:20:55,260
but it's like- - The micromanagement.

3800
02:20:55,260 --> 02:20:57,780
- Just the micromanagement and your,

3801
02:20:57,780 --> 02:21:01,650
and the politeness, but the fake politeness.

3802
02:21:01,650 --> 02:21:03,480
And it just makes me feel like,

3803
02:21:03,480 --> 02:21:06,414
I think like what would Kubrick do?

3804
02:21:06,414 --> 02:21:08,250
Would he murder all of them right now?

3805
02:21:08,250 --> 02:21:09,720
- He would just ban them

3806
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:11,340
after he became Stanley Kubrick.

3807
02:21:11,340 --> 02:21:13,470
But he dealt with it for a while.

3808
02:21:13,470 --> 02:21:15,990
By the way, I just went on a Kubrick binge,

3809
02:21:15,990 --> 02:21:16,823
man, he was awesome.

3810
02:21:16,823 --> 02:21:18,630
- Yeah. - I watched that World War I

3811
02:21:18,630 --> 02:21:20,220
movie of his, the one from the '50s.

3812
02:21:20,220 --> 02:21:22,980
That is such an underrated film.

3813
02:21:22,980 --> 02:21:24,840
I feel like people don't, whatever,

3814
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:25,950
we'll get past it.

3815
02:21:25,950 --> 02:21:27,480
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah, like,

3816
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:29,760
but she, dag yeah, I guess she paid for-

3817
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,110
- A hundred grand, bro.

3818
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:34,050
- A hundred and the Oprah thing,

3819
02:21:34,050 --> 02:21:35,190
she paid for the interviews.

3820
02:21:35,190 --> 02:21:37,350
- So, you know, that's another one.

3821
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:38,370
I do this for a living

3822
02:21:38,370 --> 02:21:40,860
and as you can tell, I'm a very cynical person.

3823
02:21:40,860 --> 02:21:42,990
I did not even know that celebrities got paid

3824
02:21:42,990 --> 02:21:44,220
for their endorsements.

3825
02:21:44,220 --> 02:21:47,130
I could never have imagined a universe

3826
02:21:47,130 --> 02:21:48,960
where Oprah Winfrey has paid $1 million

3827
02:21:48,960 --> 02:21:51,120
to endorse Kamala Harris.

3828
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,280
I'm like, first of all, you're a billionaire.

3829
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,590
Second, I thought you do this 'cause you believe,

3830
02:21:55,590 --> 02:21:57,630
you know? - No, I think to be fair,

3831
02:21:57,630 --> 02:22:01,260
I think the million just helps do the thing

3832
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:02,280
you would like to do.

3833
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:03,570
It's like, it's a nudge,

3834
02:22:03,570 --> 02:22:06,090
'cause I don't think any celebrity would endorse,

3835
02:22:06,090 --> 02:22:07,020
like- - Yeah, they're not doing it

3836
02:22:07,020 --> 02:22:08,190
because of the money,

3837
02:22:08,190 --> 02:22:10,380
but you should just do it for free.

3838
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:13,620
I can't even believe that you're doing this for money.

3839
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:16,110
I mean, and the fact, what was it, Alanis Morissette,

3840
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:17,070
you know how they were able,

3841
02:22:17,070 --> 02:22:18,030
they had to cut her

3842
02:22:18,030 --> 02:22:19,830
because they didn't have the funds to pay her.

3843
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:21,300
I'm like, first of all, if you believe

3844
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:22,470
you should just play for free.

3845
02:22:22,470 --> 02:22:25,800
But second, again, as a person who is deeply cynical,

3846
02:22:25,800 --> 02:22:28,800
I still am genuinely shook

3847
02:22:28,800 --> 02:22:30,253
that we are paying celebrities for their endorsements.

3848
02:22:30,253 --> 02:22:33,060
- Yeah, it's really fucked up. - That's insane.

3849
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:36,030
- Why do you think people on the left

3850
02:22:36,030 --> 02:22:38,880
who are actually in the political arena are afraid

3851
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:41,250
of doing anything longer than an hour?

3852
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:42,940
- That's a great question. - So let me just say-

3853
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:45,783
- Yeah. - Probably most of the people

3854
02:22:45,783 --> 02:22:48,250
I've talked to on this podcast are left-wing

3855
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:50,763
or have been for a long time.

3856
02:22:50,763 --> 02:22:53,100
They just don't sort of out

3857
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:56,550
and say it like most scientists are left-wing.

3858
02:22:56,550 --> 02:23:00,960
Most sort of vaguely political people are left-wing

3859
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,793
that I've talked to.

3860
02:23:01,793 --> 02:23:03,990
- Yeah. - But the closer you get

3861
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:07,233
to the actual political arena, and I've tried really hard.

3862
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:12,360
They just is the, nope, I had a bunch of people,

3863
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:14,670
the highest profile people say 15 minutes.

3864
02:23:14,670 --> 02:23:15,840
- Yeah. - 20 minutes.

3865
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:16,770
- Yeah. - And I say, nope.

3866
02:23:16,770 --> 02:23:18,732
- I'm used to that, so welcome, yeah.

3867
02:23:18,732 --> 02:23:20,250
(Saagar laughs) - Well,

3868
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:24,660
I just can't, you know, like I can't imagine

3869
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:27,940
a conversation with Kamala or with Joe Biden

3870
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:31,890
or AOC- - Obama.

3871
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:36,480
- Or Obama that's of any quality at all of any,

3872
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:39,480
the shows, any kind of humanity of the person,

3873
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:41,651
the genius of the person,

3874
02:23:41,651 --> 02:23:44,820
the interesting nuance of the person in like 30 minutes.

3875
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:46,628
Like I just can't,

3876
02:23:46,628 --> 02:23:48,270
I can't like, I don't know,

3877
02:23:48,270 --> 02:23:50,250
maybe there's people that are extremely skilled

3878
02:23:50,250 --> 02:23:51,810
that can do that.

3879
02:23:51,810 --> 02:23:52,860
You just can't.

3880
02:23:52,860 --> 02:23:54,060
- You should be optimistic

3881
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:56,670
because a huge narrative out of this election is that

3882
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:58,290
the Democrats massively fucked up

3883
02:23:58,290 --> 02:24:00,480
by not coming on this show or a real good show.

3884
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:02,520
So I actually fundamentally, number one,

3885
02:24:02,520 --> 02:24:03,690
that's gonna change dramatically.

3886
02:24:03,690 --> 02:24:04,650
- I hope so. - So be optimistic

3887
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:05,670
and keep pushing.

3888
02:24:05,670 --> 02:24:08,940
But two is, this is a good segue actually is,

3889
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:10,594
I've been thinking a lot about,

3890
02:24:10,594 --> 02:24:12,240
I know a lot of people listening to this show

3891
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:14,580
who are in tech and may have some influence on the admin.

3892
02:24:14,580 --> 02:24:16,440
So this is kind of some,

3893
02:24:16,440 --> 02:24:18,930
this is something I want people to take really seriously,

3894
02:24:18,930 --> 02:24:22,050
is I was a White House correspondent for The Daily Caller.

3895
02:24:22,050 --> 02:24:23,460
It's a conservative outlet

3896
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:25,590
in Washington during the Trump years.

3897
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:30,180
And the most important thing I learned from that was that

3898
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:33,420
under the White House Correspondents' Association,

3899
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:36,810
the way that the media cartel has everything set up

3900
02:24:36,810 --> 02:24:38,040
for access for press

3901
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:42,270
to the President is fundamentally broken, anti-American,

3902
02:24:42,270 --> 02:24:44,490
and bad for actual democracy.

3903
02:24:44,490 --> 02:24:47,100
So let me lay this out at a very mechanical level

3904
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:48,420
'cause nobody knows this.

3905
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:49,530
And I was a former

3906
02:24:49,530 --> 02:24:51,360
White House Correspondents' Association member.

3907
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:53,700
So anybody who says I'm full of shit, I was there.

3908
02:24:53,700 --> 02:24:56,520
For example, number one, all the seats in the briefing room,

3909
02:24:56,520 --> 02:24:57,720
those seats are assigned

3910
02:24:57,720 --> 02:24:59,880
by the White House Correspondents' Association,

3911
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:01,680
not by the White House itself.

3912
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:03,930
The White House Correspondents' Association requires you

3913
02:25:03,930 --> 02:25:06,000
to apply for a seat, right?

3914
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,330
That adjudication process can take literally years

3915
02:25:09,330 --> 02:25:11,700
for bylaws, elections and all these things to do.

3916
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:14,400
This means that they can slow roll the entrance

3917
02:25:14,400 --> 02:25:18,030
of new media online outlets who are allowed into the room.

3918
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:20,130
The reason it really matters not having a seat is

3919
02:25:20,130 --> 02:25:22,110
if you don't have a seat, you have to get there early

3920
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:24,120
and stand in the wings like I used to

3921
02:25:24,120 --> 02:25:25,770
and raise your hand like this and just hope

3922
02:25:25,770 --> 02:25:27,600
and pray that the press secretary can see,

3923
02:25:27,600 --> 02:25:28,860
it's extremely inconvenient.

3924
02:25:28,860 --> 02:25:30,570
I'm talking, I have to get there hours early

3925
02:25:30,570 --> 02:25:32,940
at a chance during a 15-minute briefing.

3926
02:25:32,940 --> 02:25:35,640
So one of the things is that Trump has,

3927
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:37,770
is he owes a huge part of his election

3928
02:25:37,770 --> 02:25:40,710
to coming on podcast and to new media.

3929
02:25:40,710 --> 02:25:43,350
Now because of that, it's really important

3930
02:25:43,350 --> 02:25:45,450
that the White House Correspondents' Association,

3931
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:49,290
which is a literal guild cartel that keeps people out

3932
02:25:49,290 --> 02:25:52,170
of the White House and credentials itself

3933
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:54,990
and creates this opaque mechanism

3934
02:25:54,990 --> 02:25:56,557
through which they control access.

3935
02:25:56,557 --> 02:25:58,050
You know, to asking

3936
02:25:58,050 --> 02:26:00,570
the press secretary questions is destroyed.

3937
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:02,460
And there are a lot of different ways you can do this

3938
02:26:02,460 --> 02:26:05,460
because nobody gets too is that

3939
02:26:05,460 --> 02:26:07,920
all of these rules are unofficial.

3940
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:10,080
So for example, they're just traditions.

3941
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,700
The White House is like, yeah, it's our building,

3942
02:26:11,700 --> 02:26:13,020
but you guys figure it out, right?

3943
02:26:13,020 --> 02:26:15,240
Because that's a longstanding tradition.

3944
02:26:15,240 --> 02:26:17,130
Let me give you another insane tradition

3945
02:26:17,130 --> 02:26:19,050
that currently exists in the White House.

3946
02:26:19,050 --> 02:26:21,390
The Associated Press, the White Press Secretary

3947
02:26:21,390 --> 02:26:24,090
or the Associated Press correspondent gets

3948
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:26,070
to start the briefing, traditionally,

3949
02:26:26,070 --> 02:26:27,150
they get the first question.

3950
02:26:27,150 --> 02:26:28,830
They also get to end the briefing

3951
02:26:28,830 --> 02:26:29,663
when they think it's been enough time,

3952
02:26:29,663 --> 02:26:32,070
they'll be like, "Okay, Cringe Jean Pierre,

3953
02:26:32,070 --> 02:26:32,970
Thank you," right?

3954
02:26:32,970 --> 02:26:34,470
And that calls the briefing over.

3955
02:26:34,470 --> 02:26:35,790
What, who?

3956
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:37,710
You're not even the White House Correspondents' Association.

3957
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:40,530
You literally just happen to work for the associated press.

3958
02:26:40,530 --> 02:26:43,050
Why? Like why do we allow that to happen?

3959
02:26:43,050 --> 02:26:45,660
So number one, stop doing that.

3960
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,610
To their credit, the Trump people didn't really do that,

3961
02:26:47,610 --> 02:26:49,080
but it's a longstanding tradition.

3962
02:26:49,080 --> 02:26:52,920
The other thing is that what nobody gets either is that

3963
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:54,780
the first row is all television networks

3964
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:55,830
for logistical reasons.

3965
02:26:55,830 --> 02:26:58,140
So that they can do their little standups with their mic

3966
02:26:58,140 --> 02:26:59,880
and say, "Oh, I'm reporting online for the White House."

3967
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:03,810
Well, what people don't seem to know is that

3968
02:27:03,810 --> 02:27:06,030
all the television networks are basically going

3969
02:27:06,030 --> 02:27:08,340
to ask some version of the same question.

3970
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:11,970
The reason they do that is because they need a clip

3971
02:27:11,970 --> 02:27:14,460
of their correspondent going after

3972
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:16,860
the White House Press Secretary all out Robert Mueller,

3973
02:27:16,860 --> 02:27:18,060
like whenever I was there.

3974
02:27:18,060 --> 02:27:20,970
So you get the same God damn version

3975
02:27:20,970 --> 02:27:23,760
of the stupid political questions over and over again.

3976
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:26,940
The briefing room is designed for traditional media

3977
02:27:26,940 --> 02:27:29,100
and they have all the access in the world.

3978
02:27:29,100 --> 02:27:31,800
So in an election where you owe your victory to,

3979
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:33,630
at least in part to new media

3980
02:27:33,630 --> 02:27:36,090
and recognizing and changing landscape,

3981
02:27:36,090 --> 02:27:39,390
you need to change the conduit of information

3982
02:27:39,390 --> 02:27:41,070
to the American people.

3983
02:27:41,070 --> 02:27:44,370
And in an election, I don't know if you saw this,

3984
02:27:44,370 --> 02:27:48,240
but election night coverage on cable news was down 25%,

3985
02:27:48,240 --> 02:27:49,860
just in four years, 25%.

3986
02:27:49,860 --> 02:27:53,400
That's astound, that's cable news had a monopoly

3987
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:56,010
on election night for my entire lifetime.

3988
02:27:56,010 --> 02:27:58,590
And yet, my show had record ratings that night.

3989
02:27:58,590 --> 02:28:00,810
And I, look, I'm a small slice of the puzzle here.

3990
02:28:00,810 --> 02:28:04,410
We've got Candace Owens, Patrick Bet-David, Tim Pool,

3991
02:28:04,410 --> 02:28:06,900
David Pakman, TYT, all these other people,

3992
02:28:06,900 --> 02:28:07,950
every, from what I understand,

3993
02:28:07,950 --> 02:28:09,540
all of us blew it out that night

3994
02:28:09,540 --> 02:28:12,840
because millions of Americans watched it on YouTube.

3995
02:28:12,840 --> 02:28:15,570
We even partnered with some, Decision Desk HQ,

3996
02:28:15,570 --> 02:28:18,150
so we had live data, we could make state calls

3997
02:28:18,150 --> 02:28:20,340
and we're just a silly little YouTube show.

3998
02:28:20,340 --> 02:28:22,890
My point though is that in an election

3999
02:28:22,890 --> 02:28:24,330
where the vast majority of Americans

4000
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:27,030
under the age of 55 are listening to podcasts,

4001
02:28:27,030 --> 02:28:27,870
consuming new media

4002
02:28:27,870 --> 02:28:32,220
and are not watching cable news where the median age of CNN,

4003
02:28:32,220 --> 02:28:34,290
which is the youngest viewership is 68.

4004
02:28:34,290 --> 02:28:35,790
68 is the median.

4005
02:28:35,790 --> 02:28:38,340
So statistically what does that tell us, right?

4006
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:41,550
There's a decent number of people

4007
02:28:41,550 --> 02:28:45,000
who are watching CNN who are in their 80s

4008
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,740
and in their 90s.

4009
02:28:46,740 --> 02:28:48,390
Yeah, I'm glad you brought up Alex

4010
02:28:48,390 --> 02:28:51,150
'cause he deserves a tremendous shout out Alex Bruesewitz.

4011
02:28:51,150 --> 02:28:53,912
He was the pioneer of the podcast strategy

4012
02:28:53,912 --> 02:28:56,070
for the Donald J. Trump campaign.

4013
02:28:56,070 --> 02:28:57,240
He got on your show,

4014
02:28:57,240 --> 02:29:00,540
he was able to get on Andrew Schulz's show, Rogan.

4015
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:03,810
He was the internal force that pushed a lot of this.

4016
02:29:03,810 --> 02:29:07,410
My personal hope is that somebody like Alex is elevated

4017
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:09,450
in the traditional White House bureaucracy.

4018
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:12,210
That the number of credentials that are issued

4019
02:29:12,210 --> 02:29:14,100
to these mainstream media outlets is cut.

4020
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:16,590
And there is a new lottery process put in place

4021
02:29:16,590 --> 02:29:18,810
where people with large audiences are invited.

4022
02:29:18,810 --> 02:29:21,450
And I also wanna make a case here for

4023
02:29:21,450 --> 02:29:22,920
why I think it's really important

4024
02:29:22,920 --> 02:29:24,630
for people like you and others

4025
02:29:24,630 --> 02:29:27,360
who don't have as much traditional media experience

4026
02:29:27,360 --> 02:29:30,540
to come in and practice some Capital J journalism

4027
02:29:30,540 --> 02:29:32,280
'cause it will sharpen you too,

4028
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:35,700
giving you access in that pressure cooker environment

4029
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:38,520
and having to really like sit there

4030
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:40,530
and spar a little bit with a public official

4031
02:29:40,530 --> 02:29:43,080
and not have as long necessarily as you're used to.

4032
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,930
It really hones your news media skills,

4033
02:29:45,930 --> 02:29:47,580
your news gathering skills.

4034
02:29:47,580 --> 02:29:50,310
And it will make you a better interviewer in the long run.

4035
02:29:50,310 --> 02:29:51,930
Because a lot of the things that I have learned

4036
02:29:51,930 --> 02:29:53,190
have just been through osmosis.

4037
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:55,620
I've just lived in DC, I've been so lucky.

4038
02:29:55,620 --> 02:29:57,120
I've had a lot of cool jobs

4039
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:00,360
and I've just been able to experience a lot of this stuff.

4040
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:03,420
So I'm really hoping that people who are listening to this

4041
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:06,600
who may have some influence or even the viewership,

4042
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:08,310
if you wanna, you know, reach out to them

4043
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:09,270
and all of them,

4044
02:30:09,270 --> 02:30:11,880
this is a very easily changeable problem.

4045
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:14,880
It's a cartel which has no official power.

4046
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:18,090
It's all power by tradition and it needs to be blown up.

4047
02:30:18,090 --> 02:30:20,280
It has, it does not serve America's interests

4048
02:30:20,280 --> 02:30:22,380
to have 50, 48 seats, I think in the White House

4049
02:30:22,380 --> 02:30:24,180
press briefing room with two people

4050
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:25,980
who have audiences of like five.

4051
02:30:25,980 --> 02:30:27,960
It's just makes absolutely zero.

4052
02:30:27,960 --> 02:30:31,380
Workspace, seats, access, credentials

4053
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:34,590
and also, credentials that are issued to press

4054
02:30:34,590 --> 02:30:37,290
and to other, like new media journalists

4055
02:30:37,290 --> 02:30:40,350
at major events should take precedence

4056
02:30:40,350 --> 02:30:43,620
because it's not even about rewarding the creator.

4057
02:30:43,620 --> 02:30:46,740
The American people are here, you need to meet them.

4058
02:30:46,740 --> 02:30:48,180
That's your job.

4059
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:50,640
And I'll just end with a historical thing.

4060
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:54,390
Barack Obama shocked the White House Press Corps in 2009

4061
02:30:54,390 --> 02:30:57,510
because he took a question from The Huffington Post,

4062
02:30:57,510 --> 02:30:58,710
a brand new blog.

4063
02:30:58,710 --> 02:31:00,120
But they were stunned

4064
02:31:00,120 --> 02:31:03,300
because he knew, he said, "These blog people,

4065
02:31:03,300 --> 02:31:05,670
they went all in for me and I got to reward them."

4066
02:31:05,670 --> 02:31:07,890
So there's longstanding precedence of this,

4067
02:31:07,890 --> 02:31:09,840
they'll bitch and they'll moan, they'll be upset,

4068
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:11,790
but it's their fault, you know,

4069
02:31:11,790 --> 02:31:13,530
that they don't have as much credibility

4070
02:31:13,530 --> 02:31:16,980
and it's incumbent upon the White House,

4071
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:18,300
which serves the public

4072
02:31:18,300 --> 02:31:19,650
to actually meet them where they are.

4073
02:31:19,650 --> 02:31:20,700
So I really hope that

4074
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:23,370
at least some of this is implemented inside of them.

4075
02:31:23,370 --> 02:31:25,890
- Yeah, if you break apart the cartel,

4076
02:31:25,890 --> 02:31:29,804
I think you can actually enable greater journalism, frankly.

4077
02:31:29,804 --> 02:31:31,110
- Of course. - With the capital J.

4078
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:33,180
Because actually in the long form is

4079
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:36,150
when you can do better journalism of,

4080
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:38,130
from even just the politician perspective,

4081
02:31:38,130 --> 02:31:39,870
you can disagree, you can get criticized,

4082
02:31:39,870 --> 02:31:41,460
'cause you can defend yourself.

4083
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:42,540
- I had an idea, actually.

4084
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:43,373
You tell me what you think.

4085
02:31:43,373 --> 02:31:45,390
I think a really cool format would be,

4086
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:47,730
there's a room right near the press briefing room

4087
02:31:47,730 --> 02:31:48,930
called the Roosevelt Room.

4088
02:31:48,930 --> 02:31:50,790
Beautiful room by the way, it's awesome.

4089
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:52,980
It has the Medal of Honor for Teddy Roosevelt

4090
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:55,350
and it has a portrait of him and a portrait of FDR.

4091
02:31:55,350 --> 02:31:56,183
It's one of my favorite rooms in the White House.

4092
02:31:56,183 --> 02:31:57,870
- Okay. - It's so cool.

4093
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:00,630
And so my idea would be, in the Roosevelt Room,

4094
02:32:00,630 --> 02:32:04,170
which traditionally used for press briefings and stuff,

4095
02:32:04,170 --> 02:32:08,970
is like you as the press secretary sit there,

4096
02:32:08,970 --> 02:32:11,010
I think there's like 12 seats, something like that.

4097
02:32:11,010 --> 02:32:12,630
And you set it all up and you have, let's say,

4098
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:14,490
Shure microphones like this,

4099
02:32:14,490 --> 02:32:16,110
and that person, that secretary is gonna commit

4100
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:17,610
to being there for like two hours.

4101
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:20,640
And new media people like can sit around the room,

4102
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:22,170
all of this being streamed live by the way,

4103
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:24,120
just like the White House press briefing room.

4104
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:26,220
But the expectation is that

4105
02:32:26,220 --> 02:32:28,710
the type of questions have to be substantive.

4106
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:30,180
Obviously, nothing is off limits.

4107
02:32:30,180 --> 02:32:31,920
You should never, ever, you know,

4108
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:34,020
except I'm not gonna be asked about this.

4109
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:35,760
Especially as a journalist, you can't do that.

4110
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:37,650
Every time they're like, "Hey, please don't ask about this."

4111
02:32:37,650 --> 02:32:38,640
It's like, actually that's probably

4112
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:40,260
one thing you should ask about.

4113
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:42,510
But my point being that

4114
02:32:42,510 --> 02:32:44,430
the expectation is that there's no interference

4115
02:32:44,430 --> 02:32:45,510
on the White House side,

4116
02:32:45,510 --> 02:32:48,510
but that the format itself will lend exactly

4117
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:51,030
to what you're saying to allow people to explain.

4118
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:52,770
And again, in a media era

4119
02:32:52,770 --> 02:32:54,570
where we need to trust the consumer,

4120
02:32:54,570 --> 02:32:58,560
like my show is routinely over two hours long

4121
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:00,810
on cable television.

4122
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:02,400
On cable television,

4123
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:03,780
you know, the Tucker Carlson program,

4124
02:33:03,780 --> 02:33:05,310
whenever it was on Fox News,

4125
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:08,310
without commercial breaks was about 42, 43 minutes

4126
02:33:08,310 --> 02:33:09,690
something like that of runtime.

4127
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:11,850
So I'm speaking for almost triple

4128
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:14,730
what that is on a regular basis.

4129
02:33:14,730 --> 02:33:19,200
The point is that millions are willing to sit and to listen

4130
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:21,090
but you just have to meet them where they are.

4131
02:33:21,090 --> 02:33:23,700
So I really hope that a format like that,

4132
02:33:23,700 --> 02:33:25,500
like a streamer briefing

4133
02:33:25,500 --> 02:33:27,630
or something like that, I think it's,

4134
02:33:27,630 --> 02:33:29,760
look, I know they would dunk on it endlessly,

4135
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:31,290
but I think it could work.

4136
02:33:31,290 --> 02:33:33,150
- Yeah, I think the incentives are different.

4137
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:35,733
I think it works because you don't have to,

4138
02:33:36,930 --> 02:33:39,030
like you, Saagar, don't have to signal

4139
02:33:39,030 --> 02:33:41,430
to the other journalists that you're part of the clique.

4140
02:33:41,430 --> 02:33:42,690
- Oh, I'm so glad you brought that up

4141
02:33:42,690 --> 02:33:44,250
because that was another lesson I learned.

4142
02:33:44,250 --> 02:33:46,560
I go, oh, none of you are asking important questions

4143
02:33:46,560 --> 02:33:47,393
for the people.

4144
02:33:47,393 --> 02:33:49,020
You're asking questions because you all hang out

4145
02:33:49,020 --> 02:33:51,060
with each other and you're like, oh wait.

4146
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:54,450
So this entire thing is a self-reinforcing guild

4147
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:57,900
to impress each other at cocktail parties

4148
02:33:57,900 --> 02:34:00,900
and not to actually ask anything interesting.

4149
02:34:00,900 --> 02:34:02,550
I remember people were so mad at me

4150
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:06,030
because, this was 2018 or maybe 2017,

4151
02:34:06,030 --> 02:34:10,110
and I said, "Do you think that Kim Jong Un is sincere

4152
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:12,570
in his willingness to meet with you?"

4153
02:34:12,570 --> 02:34:14,400
Something like that, to that effect.

4154
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:16,350
They were furious 'cause I didn't ask about

4155
02:34:16,350 --> 02:34:18,720
some bullshit political controversy

4156
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:19,650
that was happening at the time.

4157
02:34:19,650 --> 02:34:23,910
So in the historical legacy, what was more important,

4158
02:34:23,910 --> 02:34:25,290
the Mueller question,

4159
02:34:25,290 --> 02:34:28,950
or Donald Trump breaking 50 years

4160
02:34:28,950 --> 02:34:31,590
or whatever of tradition with America's relationship

4161
02:34:31,590 --> 02:34:33,690
with North Korea and meeting him in Singapore

4162
02:34:33,690 --> 02:34:36,720
and basically resetting that relationship for all time?

4163
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,100
As you can tell, I read a lot of book.

4164
02:34:38,100 --> 02:34:39,600
I like to take the long view.

4165
02:34:39,600 --> 02:34:42,570
Every time I would ask a question, I go, okay,

4166
02:34:42,570 --> 02:34:46,020
when the future Robert Caro is writing books

4167
02:34:46,020 --> 02:34:48,210
and he sees, he's reading the transcript

4168
02:34:48,210 --> 02:34:49,260
of the White House press briefing,

4169
02:34:49,260 --> 02:34:50,550
you don't even know who this kid is.

4170
02:34:50,550 --> 02:34:52,530
He goes, "Oh, that was a pretty good question right there."

4171
02:34:52,530 --> 02:34:54,417
That's pretty relevant, you know.

4172
02:34:54,417 --> 02:34:55,950
You got to think about all the bullshit

4173
02:34:55,950 --> 02:34:57,330
that gets left on the cutting room floor.

4174
02:34:57,330 --> 02:34:59,520
- I love that view of journalism actually.

4175
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:03,120
The goal is to end up as one line

4176
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:04,620
in a history book- - Yeah.

4177
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:05,820
- 50 years from now. - I just want a quote

4178
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:06,840
of what the president said

4179
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:07,673
to something that I ask. - Yeah.

4180
02:35:07,673 --> 02:35:09,060
- In a book, I'd be happy,

4181
02:35:09,060 --> 02:35:10,440
I would die happy with that.

4182
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:12,090
If you told me that when I'm like a 90-year-old man,

4183
02:35:12,090 --> 02:35:15,150
I'd be like, man, and I, that means I succeeded.

4184
02:35:15,150 --> 02:35:17,290
- Yeah, when the AIs write the history-

4185
02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:19,680
- Yeah, that's right. - Of human civilization.

4186
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:22,620
One of the things I continuously learned from you

4187
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:26,720
when looking back through history is how crazy

4188
02:35:26,720 --> 02:35:27,780
(Saagar laughing)

4189
02:35:27,780 --> 02:35:29,760
American politics has been throughout history.

4190
02:35:29,760 --> 02:35:31,380
It makes me feel a lot better about the current day.

4191
02:35:31,380 --> 02:35:32,213
- It should.

4192
02:35:32,213 --> 02:35:33,453
- Corruption. - Yes.

4193
02:35:34,950 --> 02:35:38,100
- Just the divisiveness also.

4194
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:39,420
- Just the- - It's been way worse.

4195
02:35:39,420 --> 02:35:41,220
- Stealing elections.

4196
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:42,053
- Yes.

4197
02:35:42,053 --> 02:35:44,850
- At all levels of government and direct stealing

4198
02:35:44,850 --> 02:35:47,760
and indirect stealing, all kinds of stuff so.

4199
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:50,820
Is there stuff that jumps out to mind throughout history

4200
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:51,653
that's just like

4201
02:35:53,880 --> 02:35:58,200
the craziest corruptions or stealing of elections

4202
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:59,370
that come to mind?

4203
02:35:59,370 --> 02:36:00,870
- I'll give them micro and the macro.

4204
02:36:00,870 --> 02:36:03,600
So my favorite example is Robert Caro,

4205
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:05,550
who I've probably talked about him a lot.

4206
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:06,420
God bless you, Robert.

4207
02:36:06,420 --> 02:36:08,220
I hope you live to write your last book

4208
02:36:08,220 --> 02:36:10,350
because we really need that from you.

4209
02:36:10,350 --> 02:36:13,770
But Robert came to Texas,

4210
02:36:13,770 --> 02:36:16,290
he only intended on writing three books

4211
02:36:16,290 --> 02:36:17,940
about Lyndon Johnson.

4212
02:36:17,940 --> 02:36:20,280
He's currently completed four and he is on his fifth

4213
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:22,140
and it's taken over 40 years to write those.

4214
02:36:22,140 --> 02:36:24,870
And one of the reasons is he just kept uncovering

4215
02:36:24,870 --> 02:36:25,710
so much stuff.

4216
02:36:25,710 --> 02:36:29,010
And one of them is book two, "Means of Ascent,"

4217
02:36:29,010 --> 02:36:30,660
he never intended to write it.

4218
02:36:30,660 --> 02:36:33,780
But as he began to investigate Lyndon Johnson's

4219
02:36:33,780 --> 02:36:37,710
1948 Senate election, he realizes in real time

4220
02:36:37,710 --> 02:36:39,870
how rigged and stolen it was.

4221
02:36:39,870 --> 02:36:42,780
And so I often tell people,

4222
02:36:42,780 --> 02:36:45,990
what if I told you that we lived in the most secure

4223
02:36:45,990 --> 02:36:48,190
election period in modern history?

4224
02:36:48,190 --> 02:36:49,680
- Yeah. - They wouldn't believe it.

4225
02:36:49,680 --> 02:36:51,780
But if you read through that shit,

4226
02:36:51,780 --> 02:36:55,290
I'm talking about bags of cash, millions of dollars,

4227
02:36:55,290 --> 02:36:57,840
literal stuffed ballot boxes.

4228
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:59,550
It's great to be back here in Texas

4229
02:36:59,550 --> 02:37:01,560
because I always think about that place like

4230
02:37:01,560 --> 02:37:03,930
down in Zapata and Starr County.

4231
02:37:03,930 --> 02:37:06,840
I'm talking like basically Mexico,

4232
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:10,260
where these dons were in power in the 1940s

4233
02:37:10,260 --> 02:37:12,990
and they would literally stuff the ballot boxes

4234
02:37:12,990 --> 02:37:14,430
with the rolls and they wouldn't even allow

4235
02:37:14,430 --> 02:37:15,540
people to come and vote,

4236
02:37:15,540 --> 02:37:18,270
they just checkmarked it all for you based upon the amount

4237
02:37:18,270 --> 02:37:19,507
that you paid.

4238
02:37:19,507 --> 02:37:23,760
"Means of Ascent" is the painstaking detail of exactly

4239
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:26,760
how Lyndon Johnson stole the 1948 Senate election.

4240
02:37:26,760 --> 02:37:29,250
And so nothing like that

4241
02:37:29,250 --> 02:37:31,110
as far as I know is still happening.

4242
02:37:31,110 --> 02:37:35,190
Macro, we can talk about the 1876 election,

4243
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:36,240
Rutherford B. Hayes,

4244
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:38,880
one of the closest elections in modern history.

4245
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:40,260
It was one of those that got kicked

4246
02:37:40,260 --> 02:37:41,130
with the House of Representative

4247
02:37:41,130 --> 02:37:43,560
that was an insane, insane time.

4248
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:45,540
The corrupt bargain that was struck

4249
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:47,250
to basically end reconstruction

4250
02:37:47,250 --> 02:37:49,110
and federal occupation of the South.

4251
02:37:49,110 --> 02:37:51,750
And of course, the amount of wheeling and dealing

4252
02:37:51,750 --> 02:37:54,690
that happened inside of that was absolutely

4253
02:37:54,690 --> 02:37:55,950
bonkers and nuts.

4254
02:37:55,950 --> 02:37:57,930
That was what an actual stolen election looks like.

4255
02:37:57,930 --> 02:37:59,700
Just so people know.

4256
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:01,470
So on a micro and a macro,

4257
02:38:01,470 --> 02:38:03,630
yeah, that's what it really looks like.

4258
02:38:03,630 --> 02:38:06,360
And so, look, I understand where people are coming from,

4259
02:38:06,360 --> 02:38:08,550
also, let's do what, 1960.

4260
02:38:08,550 --> 02:38:09,390
That was pretty wild.

4261
02:38:09,390 --> 02:38:12,870
I mean in 1960, there was all those allegations

4262
02:38:12,870 --> 02:38:15,330
about Illinois going for Kennedy.

4263
02:38:15,330 --> 02:38:16,890
If you look at the actual vote totals

4264
02:38:16,890 --> 02:38:18,570
of Kennedy and Nixon, wow.

4265
02:38:18,570 --> 02:38:22,950
I mean, it's such an insanely close presidential election.

4266
02:38:22,950 --> 02:38:24,840
And even though the electoral college victory looks

4267
02:38:24,840 --> 02:38:26,070
a little bit differently,

4268
02:38:26,070 --> 02:38:28,117
Nixon would openly talk about, he's like,

4269
02:38:28,117 --> 02:38:32,220
"Oh, old Joe Kennedy rigged Illinois for his boy."

4270
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:34,650
And he'd be like, "And we didn't even have a chance in Texas

4271
02:38:34,650 --> 02:38:36,030
with Lyndon pulling," you know,

4272
02:38:36,030 --> 02:38:40,170
like Lyndon stuffing the ballot boxes down there.

4273
02:38:40,170 --> 02:38:41,913
So, and this is open on the,

4274
02:38:41,913 --> 02:38:43,710
like they openly admit this stuff.

4275
02:38:43,710 --> 02:38:44,543
They talk about it.

4276
02:38:44,543 --> 02:38:48,120
So actually there's a funny story.

4277
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:49,647
LBJ lost his,

4278
02:38:49,647 --> 02:38:54,030
I think it's 1941 Senate primary

4279
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:57,510
and it's because the, his opponent Pappy O'Daniel

4280
02:38:57,510 --> 02:38:59,760
actually outstole Lyndon.

4281
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:00,930
So they were both corrupt.

4282
02:39:00,930 --> 02:39:03,440
But Pappy O'Daniel stuffed the ballot box

4283
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:06,540
in like the fifth day of the seven days to count the votes.

4284
02:39:06,540 --> 02:39:08,940
And FDR loved LBJ.

4285
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:13,710
And it's interesting right, that FDR recognized Johnson's,

4286
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:17,550
his talent and he goes, "Lyndon, you, you know,

4287
02:39:17,550 --> 02:39:20,877
in New York we sit on the ballot boxes till we count them."

4288
02:39:20,877 --> 02:39:22,980
You know, 'cause he's admitting that he,

4289
02:39:22,980 --> 02:39:25,320
you know, participated in a lot of this stuff.

4290
02:39:25,320 --> 02:39:27,990
So this high level chicanery

4291
02:39:27,990 --> 02:39:31,530
of stolen elections is actually an American pastime

4292
02:39:31,530 --> 02:39:34,140
that we luckily have moved on from.

4293
02:39:34,140 --> 02:39:37,530
And quite a lot of people do not know the exact

4294
02:39:37,530 --> 02:39:40,290
intricate details of how wild it was back in the day.

4295
02:39:40,290 --> 02:39:42,180
- Yeah, it's actually one of the things,

4296
02:39:42,180 --> 02:39:44,160
it's harder to pull off a bunch of bullshit

4297
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:46,170
with all these cameras everywhere now.

4298
02:39:46,170 --> 02:39:48,810
- Transparency too, lack of cash, banking regulations,

4299
02:39:48,810 --> 02:39:50,370
there's a variety of reasons, but yeah.

4300
02:39:50,370 --> 02:39:53,580
- So that said, let's talk about the 2020 election.

4301
02:39:53,580 --> 02:39:55,410
Seems like forever ago.

4302
02:39:55,410 --> 02:39:58,500
Do you think it was rigged the way that Trump claimed?

4303
02:39:58,500 --> 02:39:59,790
- No.

4304
02:39:59,790 --> 02:40:02,340
- And was it rigged in other ways?

4305
02:40:02,340 --> 02:40:05,490
- Look, this is the problem with language like rigged.

4306
02:40:05,490 --> 02:40:07,550
And by the way, when I interviewed Vivek Ramaswamy,

4307
02:40:07,550 --> 02:40:08,730
he said the exact same thing.

4308
02:40:08,730 --> 02:40:11,460
So for all the MAGA, people who are gonna get mad at me,

4309
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:12,870
Vivek agrees, all right?

4310
02:40:12,870 --> 02:40:14,793
And if, okay,

4311
02:40:16,424 --> 02:40:19,950
I have observed, and I'm gonna put my analyst hat on,

4312
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:22,680
there are two theories of "Stop the Steal."

4313
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:24,750
One I call low IQ "Stop the Steal"

4314
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:27,000
and one I call high IQ "Stop the Steal."

4315
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,190
Low IQ "Stop the Steal" is basically

4316
02:40:29,190 --> 02:40:31,140
what Donald Trump has advocated,

4317
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:35,520
where, you know, Dominion voting machines and bamboo ballots

4318
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:38,100
and Venezuela and Sidney Powell

4319
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:40,080
and all the people involved basically got indicted

4320
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:40,913
by the State of Georgia.

4321
02:40:40,913 --> 02:40:41,970
I'm not saying that that was correct,

4322
02:40:41,970 --> 02:40:43,920
I'm just like, that's what that actually looked like,

4323
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:45,990
Rudy Giuliani, et cetera.

4324
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:49,440
High IQ "Stop the Steal" is basically,

4325
02:40:49,440 --> 02:40:52,530
and actually, I mean these are not illegitimate arguments.

4326
02:40:52,530 --> 02:40:56,460
The school of thought is, it was illegitimate

4327
02:40:56,460 --> 02:40:59,190
for the State of Pennsylvania and other swing states

4328
02:40:59,190 --> 02:41:03,780
to change mail-in balloting laws as a response to COVID,

4329
02:41:03,780 --> 02:41:05,820
which enabled millions of people more

4330
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:07,200
to vote that wouldn't have

4331
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:10,140
and that those change in regulations became

4332
02:41:10,140 --> 02:41:11,310
enough to swing the election.

4333
02:41:11,310 --> 02:41:12,660
I actually think that that is true.

4334
02:41:12,660 --> 02:41:15,420
Now, would you say that that's rigged?

4335
02:41:15,420 --> 02:41:16,890
That's a very important question

4336
02:41:16,890 --> 02:41:19,170
'cause we're talking about a Republican state legislature,

4337
02:41:19,170 --> 02:41:21,060
a Republican state supreme court, right?

4338
02:41:21,060 --> 02:41:23,070
The two that actually ruled on this question.

4339
02:41:23,070 --> 02:41:24,360
So could you say that it was rigged

4340
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:26,310
by the Democrats to do that?

4341
02:41:26,310 --> 02:41:28,920
Another problem with that theory is that

4342
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:31,080
while you can say that that's unfair

4343
02:41:31,080 --> 02:41:33,060
to change the rules last time around,

4344
02:41:33,060 --> 02:41:35,430
you can also understand it to a certain extent.

4345
02:41:35,430 --> 02:41:37,410
And I'm not justifying it, I'm just giving you an example.

4346
02:41:37,410 --> 02:41:42,210
So for example, after the hurricane hit North Carolina,

4347
02:41:42,210 --> 02:41:45,540
Republican officials were like, "Hey, we need to make sure

4348
02:41:45,540 --> 02:41:47,640
that these people who in Western North Carolina,

4349
02:41:47,640 --> 02:41:49,890
who were affected by the hurricane could still be able

4350
02:41:49,890 --> 02:41:51,420
to have access to the ballot box."

4351
02:41:51,420 --> 02:41:53,160
And people were like, "Oh, so you're saying

4352
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:54,630
in an extraordinary circumstance

4353
02:41:54,630 --> 02:41:56,130
that you should change voting reg, you know,

4354
02:41:56,130 --> 02:41:58,890
access and regularity to make sure that people have access?"

4355
02:41:58,890 --> 02:42:01,800
So my point is, you can see the logic

4356
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:03,210
through which this happened.

4357
02:42:03,210 --> 02:42:06,810
And the high IQ version is basically the one

4358
02:42:06,810 --> 02:42:09,000
that was adopted by Josh Hawley

4359
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,250
whenever he voted against certification.

4360
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:13,950
He said that the State of Pennsylvania,

4361
02:42:13,950 --> 02:42:15,600
particularly election law,

4362
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:17,490
and that those changes were unfair

4363
02:42:17,490 --> 02:42:20,040
and led to the quote unquote "rigging" of the election

4364
02:42:20,040 --> 02:42:21,120
against Donald Trump.

4365
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:22,740
Now there's an even higher IQ,

4366
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:24,510
galaxy brain "Stop the Steal."

4367
02:42:24,510 --> 02:42:28,320
Galaxy brain "Stop the Steal" is one that you saw,

4368
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:31,170
with great love and respect, my friend JD Vance,

4369
02:42:31,170 --> 02:42:33,060
at his debate with Tim Walz.

4370
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:36,390
When Tim Walz asked him, what did he see,

4371
02:42:36,390 --> 02:42:38,460
he said, "Did Donald Trump win the 2020 election?"

4372
02:42:38,460 --> 02:42:40,500
He's like, "Tim, I focus on the future."

4373
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:43,650
And then he started talking about censorship,

4374
02:42:43,650 --> 02:42:45,660
the Hunter Biden laptop story.

4375
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:48,210
If you take a look at the Joe Rogan interview,

4376
02:42:48,210 --> 02:42:49,770
Rogan actually asked JD this.

4377
02:42:49,770 --> 02:42:51,240
He's like, what do you mean you in the election?

4378
02:42:51,240 --> 02:42:52,470
Some version of that.

4379
02:42:52,470 --> 02:42:53,970
And JD was like, "Well,

4380
02:42:53,970 --> 02:42:57,030
what I get really frustrated by is people will bring up

4381
02:42:57,030 --> 02:42:59,910
all these insane conspiracy theories but they ignore

4382
02:42:59,910 --> 02:43:03,150
that the media censored the Hunter Biden laptop story

4383
02:43:03,150 --> 02:43:06,270
and that big tech had its finger on the thumb

4384
02:43:06,270 --> 02:43:07,590
for the Democrats."

4385
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:09,390
Now that is empirically true, okay?

4386
02:43:09,390 --> 02:43:10,560
That is true, right?

4387
02:43:10,560 --> 02:43:13,290
Now would you say that that's rigged?

4388
02:43:13,290 --> 02:43:14,123
I'm not gonna use that word

4389
02:43:14,123 --> 02:43:15,480
'cause that's a very different word.

4390
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:17,190
Now, would you say that that's unfair?

4391
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:19,230
Yeah, I think it's unfair.

4392
02:43:19,230 --> 02:43:20,850
So there's another, there's,

4393
02:43:20,850 --> 02:43:23,820
a lot of MAGA folks picked up on this one.

4394
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:25,737
There was a Time Magazine article in 2020

4395
02:43:25,737 --> 02:43:28,680
and that's very famous in their crowd called, you know,

4396
02:43:28,680 --> 02:43:30,780
it was like the fight to fortify the election.

4397
02:43:30,780 --> 02:43:33,930
And it was about all of these institutions

4398
02:43:33,930 --> 02:43:35,550
that put their fingers on the scale

4399
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:37,800
for Joe Biden against Donald Trump.

4400
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:39,780
So I will put it this way.

4401
02:43:39,780 --> 02:43:43,500
Was Donald Trump up against the titanic forces

4402
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:46,800
of billionaires, tech censorship,

4403
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:51,600
and elite institutions who all did absolute damnedest

4404
02:43:51,600 --> 02:43:53,250
to defeat him in 2020?

4405
02:43:53,250 --> 02:43:54,840
Yes, that is true.

4406
02:43:54,840 --> 02:43:56,640
And, in a sense,

4407
02:43:56,640 --> 02:44:00,990
the galaxy brain case is the only one of those

4408
02:44:00,990 --> 02:44:03,060
which I think is truly legitimate.

4409
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:05,130
And I'm not gonna put it off the table,

4410
02:44:05,130 --> 02:44:07,530
but this is the problem,

4411
02:44:07,530 --> 02:44:09,090
that's not what Trump means.

4412
02:44:09,090 --> 02:44:09,923
You know, Trump,

4413
02:44:09,923 --> 02:44:11,040
he, Trump, by the way,

4414
02:44:11,040 --> 02:44:13,500
will never tell you what I just told you, right?

4415
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:14,580
JD will.

4416
02:44:14,580 --> 02:44:18,420
If you go and you ask any of these Republican politicians

4417
02:44:18,420 --> 02:44:19,470
when they're challenged on it

4418
02:44:19,470 --> 02:44:22,440
and they don't wanna say that Trump a loss of 2020 election,

4419
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:25,470
they'll give the the galaxy brain case that I just gave.

4420
02:44:25,470 --> 02:44:27,570
And again, I don't think it's wrong,

4421
02:44:27,570 --> 02:44:28,620
but it's like, guys,

4422
02:44:28,620 --> 02:44:31,140
that's not what he means when he says it.

4423
02:44:31,140 --> 02:44:33,480
And that's the important parsing of the case, right?

4424
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:36,060
- So first at a high level Trump or otherwise,

4425
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:38,790
I don't like anyone who whines when they lose, period.

4426
02:44:38,790 --> 02:44:40,693
- Yeah, although he did tell you he lost, you notice that?

4427
02:44:40,693 --> 02:44:43,560
That's the only time he's ever said it, ever.

4428
02:44:43,560 --> 02:44:45,150
You're famous, you're in history for that one.

4429
02:44:45,150 --> 02:44:46,777
- Lost by the whisker. - Yeah, yeah.

4430
02:44:46,777 --> 02:44:48,507
- "I lost by a whisker."

4431
02:44:49,830 --> 02:44:51,990
- I mean, there is a case to be made that he was joking,

4432
02:44:51,990 --> 02:44:53,090
I don't know. - Yeah.

4433
02:44:54,090 --> 02:44:55,620
But there is a kind of weaving

4434
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:56,730
that he does with humor

4435
02:44:56,730 --> 02:44:59,310
where sometimes the sarcasm, sometimes not,

4436
02:44:59,310 --> 02:45:03,750
much easier to showcase in a three-hour interview, I'll say.

4437
02:45:03,750 --> 02:45:04,890
- Good call, go ahead.

4438
02:45:04,890 --> 02:45:06,635
- I couldn't even like play with that

4439
02:45:06,635 --> 02:45:07,980
when you have 40 minutes.

4440
02:45:07,980 --> 02:45:09,480
- I know, bro. - You're like,

4441
02:45:10,890 --> 02:45:13,830
you know, I could do just 40 minutes on weaving alone.

4442
02:45:13,830 --> 02:45:15,570
- For your style, it doesn't work.

4443
02:45:15,570 --> 02:45:18,420
And I can tell you how the way I interview politicians is

4444
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:20,070
I just do pure policy.

4445
02:45:20,070 --> 02:45:22,085
So when I, the first time I interviewed Trump,

4446
02:45:22,085 --> 02:45:24,120
I compiled a list of 15 subjects.

4447
02:45:24,120 --> 02:45:27,150
Me and my editor, Vince Coglianese, shout out to Vince,

4448
02:45:27,150 --> 02:45:29,130
and the two of us sat in an office

4449
02:45:29,130 --> 02:45:31,890
and then we had questions by priority in each category.

4450
02:45:31,890 --> 02:45:33,930
And if we felt like we were running short on time,

4451
02:45:33,930 --> 02:45:36,030
we would move around those different ones.

4452
02:45:36,030 --> 02:45:37,740
But that was purely, he's the president,

4453
02:45:37,740 --> 02:45:38,970
we're asking him for his opinions

4454
02:45:38,970 --> 02:45:40,800
on an immigration bill or whatever.

4455
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:42,500
For what you do, it's impossible to do

4456
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:46,500
in 40 minutes. - Yeah, I just wanna say that

4457
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:48,210
thank you for everybody involved,

4458
02:45:48,210 --> 02:45:50,940
for making my conversation with Donald Trump possible,

4459
02:45:50,940 --> 02:45:53,970
but I've learned a lot from that, that I just,

4460
02:45:53,970 --> 02:45:57,840
if I'm told that all I have is 40 minutes,

4461
02:45:57,840 --> 02:46:01,590
I'm very politely sparing, in that case,

4462
02:46:01,590 --> 02:46:04,260
Donald Trump the 40 minutes and just walking away

4463
02:46:04,260 --> 02:46:05,941
'cause I don't think I could do a good job

4464
02:46:05,941 --> 02:46:06,870
in 40 minutes. - I think that is the correct

4465
02:46:06,870 --> 02:46:07,830
decision on your part.

4466
02:46:07,830 --> 02:46:08,663
- [Lex] Yeah.

4467
02:46:08,663 --> 02:46:10,380
- And also would encourage you

4468
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:12,180
to have the confidence at this point

4469
02:46:12,180 --> 02:46:14,790
that you are in a position of something

4470
02:46:14,790 --> 02:46:16,680
that we call in the business,

4471
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:18,510
the ability to compel the interview.

4472
02:46:18,510 --> 02:46:21,840
And by to compel means to be able to bring

4473
02:46:21,840 --> 02:46:24,360
somebody else to you and not the other way around.

4474
02:46:24,360 --> 02:46:25,350
- Yeah. - And,

4475
02:46:25,350 --> 02:46:26,730
I think that you and Rogan

4476
02:46:26,730 --> 02:46:29,340
and a few others are in that very unique position.

4477
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:32,340
And I would really encourage you guys to stick to your guns

4478
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:34,800
on things that make you feel comfortable.

4479
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,540
Because, you know, those of us in news,

4480
02:46:36,540 --> 02:46:37,830
we will always negotiate.

4481
02:46:37,830 --> 02:46:39,540
We'll all, we're willing to do short form

4482
02:46:39,540 --> 02:46:40,620
'cause we're asking about policy.

4483
02:46:40,620 --> 02:46:43,050
But for the style that you help popularize

4484
02:46:43,050 --> 02:46:45,390
and I think that you're uniquely talented and good at,

4485
02:46:45,390 --> 02:46:47,790
that's very important not to compromise on so.

4486
02:46:47,790 --> 02:46:48,900
- Thank you for saying those words.

4487
02:46:48,900 --> 02:46:50,910
And that's not just in the interest of journalism

4488
02:46:50,910 --> 02:46:52,170
and the interest of conversation,

4489
02:46:52,170 --> 02:46:54,210
it's the interest of the guest as well.

4490
02:46:54,210 --> 02:46:55,043
Right? - Yeah, absolutely.

4491
02:46:55,043 --> 02:46:55,931
- [Lex] To bring out the best in them.

4492
02:46:55,931 --> 02:46:58,650
- Yeah, I mean, I would feel really at a disservice

4493
02:46:58,650 --> 02:47:01,350
and I would feel like people would not get a unique

4494
02:47:01,350 --> 02:47:03,750
understanding of like my own thought process

4495
02:47:03,750 --> 02:47:05,790
and my backstory if I was not able to sit here

4496
02:47:05,790 --> 02:47:09,600
for literally hours and to explain in deep detail

4497
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:11,370
like how I think about the world.

4498
02:47:11,370 --> 02:47:12,750
Not that anyone cares that much,

4499
02:47:12,750 --> 02:47:14,010
but, you know, it's just like,

4500
02:47:14,010 --> 02:47:16,890
I hope, all I can do, is I hope it's helpful.

4501
02:47:16,890 --> 02:47:18,630
I wanna help people think

4502
02:47:18,630 --> 02:47:20,310
because when I was growing,

4503
02:47:20,310 --> 02:47:21,870
I was growing up not far from here,

4504
02:47:21,870 --> 02:47:24,060
90 minutes from here in College Station,

4505
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:27,300
I felt very uniquely closed off from the world.

4506
02:47:27,300 --> 02:47:29,250
And I found the world through books.

4507
02:47:29,250 --> 02:47:30,740
And books saved my life.

4508
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:33,360
They've been many, so many different times.

4509
02:47:33,360 --> 02:47:35,610
And I hope to encourage that in other people.

4510
02:47:35,610 --> 02:47:38,910
I really, no matter where you are, no matter who you are,

4511
02:47:38,910 --> 02:47:41,640
no matter how busy you are, you have some time

4512
02:47:41,640 --> 02:47:44,340
to either sit down with a book or put on an audiobook

4513
02:47:44,340 --> 02:47:47,460
and you can transport yourself into a different world.

4514
02:47:47,460 --> 02:47:48,510
It's so important.

4515
02:47:48,510 --> 02:47:50,280
And that's something that your show

4516
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:51,630
really helps me with too.

4517
02:47:51,630 --> 02:47:53,070
I love listening to your show whenever,

4518
02:47:53,070 --> 02:47:54,070
sometimes when I'm too into politics

4519
02:47:54,070 --> 02:47:55,350
and I need to listen to something,

4520
02:47:55,350 --> 02:47:57,360
I'll listen to that Mayan historian guy.

4521
02:47:57,360 --> 02:47:58,710
I love stuff like that.

4522
02:47:58,710 --> 02:48:00,090
Absolutely. - I've been a deep dive

4523
02:48:00,090 --> 02:48:01,620
on Genghis Kahn.

4524
02:48:01,620 --> 02:48:04,680
Reading "Genghis Kahn and the Making of the Modern World."

4525
02:48:04,680 --> 02:48:05,880
- Yeah, Jack Weatherford.

4526
02:48:05,880 --> 02:48:07,500
Fantastic. - Yeah, he's coming on.

4527
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:08,333
- Is he?

4528
02:48:08,333 --> 02:48:09,420
- Yeah. - Amazing.

4529
02:48:09,420 --> 02:48:11,550
And again, shout out to Dan Carlin.

4530
02:48:11,550 --> 02:48:13,710
- The goat, the OG,

4531
02:48:13,710 --> 02:48:15,390
Dan, I've never met you before.

4532
02:48:15,390 --> 02:48:17,220
I would love to have correspondence at some point.

4533
02:48:17,220 --> 02:48:18,150
I love you so much.

4534
02:48:18,150 --> 02:48:19,170
You changed my life, man.

4535
02:48:19,170 --> 02:48:20,850
- I met him once before

4536
02:48:20,850 --> 02:48:21,797
and it felt

4537
02:48:21,797 --> 02:48:22,630
I mean I was, - I listened in your interview

4538
02:48:22,630 --> 02:48:24,060
with him, it was amazing. - I was starstruck.

4539
02:48:24,060 --> 02:48:25,950
Very, very starstruck.

4540
02:48:25,950 --> 02:48:27,404
And his, I mean there's so much

4541
02:48:27,404 --> 02:48:28,885
"Painfotainment" that I've listened to

4542
02:48:28,885 --> 02:48:29,760
many times. - You know, I think his

4543
02:48:29,760 --> 02:48:32,017
best series, one of his best series he gets no credit for,

4544
02:48:32,017 --> 02:48:33,300
"Ghost of the Ostfront."

4545
02:48:33,300 --> 02:48:34,980
Nobody gives him credit for that one.

4546
02:48:34,980 --> 02:48:37,290
That's OG, this is 2011 series.

4547
02:48:37,290 --> 02:48:41,430
But his "Ghost of the Ostfront" on the eastern front

4548
02:48:41,430 --> 02:48:45,450
of the Nazi war against Russia fundamentally changed

4549
02:48:45,450 --> 02:48:47,280
my view of warfare forever.

4550
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:49,530
And also, at that time I was very young,

4551
02:48:49,530 --> 02:48:52,170
and to me, World War II was "Saving Private Ryan."

4552
02:48:52,170 --> 02:48:54,360
I wasn't as well read as I am now.

4553
02:48:54,360 --> 02:48:57,930
And I was like, oh, shit, this entire thing happened,

4554
02:48:57,930 --> 02:48:59,760
which actually decided the Second World War

4555
02:48:59,760 --> 02:49:02,280
and I don't know anything about this.

4556
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:04,290
So shout out to Dan, God bless you, man.

4557
02:49:04,290 --> 02:49:06,957
- And his quote unquote "short episodes,"

4558
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:10,440
I think on slavery in general throughout human history-

4559
02:49:10,440 --> 02:49:11,850
- That was an awesome episode.

4560
02:49:11,850 --> 02:49:13,980
I actually bought a bunch of Hugh Thomas books

4561
02:49:13,980 --> 02:49:14,970
because of that episode.

4562
02:49:14,970 --> 02:49:17,610
I'd never really read about African slavery

4563
02:49:17,610 --> 02:49:20,490
or the slave trade outside of the Civil War context.

4564
02:49:20,490 --> 02:49:21,870
So again, shout out to him for that one.

4565
02:49:21,870 --> 02:49:23,160
That was an amazing episode.

4566
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:24,480
His Japan series too.

4567
02:49:24,480 --> 02:49:25,950
I'm going to Japan in a few days.

4568
02:49:25,950 --> 02:49:26,880
- Yeah. - And

4569
02:49:26,880 --> 02:49:28,680
I keep thinking of what he always talked about

4570
02:49:28,680 --> 02:49:30,277
in his "Supernova in the East,"

4571
02:49:30,277 --> 02:49:33,810
"The Japanese are like everyone else, but only more so."

4572
02:49:33,810 --> 02:49:35,940
And, God, I love that quote.

4573
02:49:35,940 --> 02:49:36,773
- Okay, he's great.

4574
02:49:36,773 --> 02:49:41,773
And we, ironically arrived at this tangent

4575
02:49:41,790 --> 02:49:44,070
while talking about the 2020 election.

4576
02:49:44,070 --> 02:49:44,903
- Yeah, yeah.

4577
02:49:45,756 --> 02:49:47,340
That's why podcasting is fun.

4578
02:49:47,340 --> 02:49:48,960
- 'Cause you said lost by a whisker.

4579
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:49,793
- [Saagar] Yeah.

4580
02:49:49,793 --> 02:49:52,260
- And now we're dragging us screaming back

4581
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:53,613
to the topic.

4582
02:49:55,410 --> 02:50:00,410
One of the things I was bothered by is Trump claiming

4583
02:50:01,230 --> 02:50:04,360
that there's widespread, as you're saying, low IQ theory.

4584
02:50:04,360 --> 02:50:06,660
- Yeah. - The widespread voter fraud.

4585
02:50:06,660 --> 02:50:10,413
And I saw no evidence of that that he provided.

4586
02:50:11,370 --> 02:50:14,850
And all right, well that's, let's put that on the table.

4587
02:50:14,850 --> 02:50:17,460
And then the other thing I was troubled by

4588
02:50:17,460 --> 02:50:21,150
that maybe you can comfort me in the context of history,

4589
02:50:21,150 --> 02:50:24,990
how easily the base ate that up.

4590
02:50:24,990 --> 02:50:26,680
- Yeah. - That they were

4591
02:50:27,810 --> 02:50:31,200
able to believe the election was truly rigged based on

4592
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:33,900
no clear evidence that I saw.

4593
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:35,604
And they just love the story.

4594
02:50:35,604 --> 02:50:38,130
And there is something compelling to this story

4595
02:50:38,130 --> 02:50:41,760
that, you know, like this DNC type, like with Bernie,

4596
02:50:41,760 --> 02:50:44,250
the establishments just, they're corrupt,

4597
02:50:44,250 --> 02:50:48,199
and they steal the will of the people.

4598
02:50:48,199 --> 02:50:53,199
And like the lack of desire

4599
02:50:53,220 --> 02:50:56,550
from the base or from people to see any evidence of that,

4600
02:50:56,550 --> 02:50:57,960
what's really troubled me.

4601
02:50:57,960 --> 02:50:59,760
- Yeah, I'm gonna give you one of the most

4602
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:02,310
depressing quotes, which is deeply true.

4603
02:51:02,310 --> 02:51:04,957
Roger Ailes, who is a genius, shout out to

4604
02:51:04,957 --> 02:51:07,290
"The Loudest Voice in the Room" by Gabriel Sherman.

4605
02:51:07,290 --> 02:51:08,970
That book changed my life too

4606
02:51:08,970 --> 02:51:10,897
because it really made me understand media.

4607
02:51:10,897 --> 02:51:14,130
"People don't wanna be informed, they wanna feel informed."

4608
02:51:14,130 --> 02:51:15,840
That is one of the most fundamental

4609
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:17,760
media insights of all time. - What the fuck,

4610
02:51:17,760 --> 02:51:18,593
what a line.

4611
02:51:18,593 --> 02:51:19,440
- Roger Ailes.

4612
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:20,790
A genius.

4613
02:51:20,790 --> 02:51:22,410
A genius in his own right.

4614
02:51:22,410 --> 02:51:24,630
Who, you know, he changed the world.

4615
02:51:24,630 --> 02:51:25,770
He certainly did.

4616
02:51:25,770 --> 02:51:30,030
He, you know, he's the one who kind of gets credit for

4617
02:51:30,030 --> 02:51:31,770
one of the greatest debate lines of all time

4618
02:51:31,770 --> 02:51:34,230
'cause he was an advisor to President Reagan.

4619
02:51:34,230 --> 02:51:36,037
Whenever he broke in, he was like,

4620
02:51:36,037 --> 02:51:37,140
"Mr. President, people wanna know

4621
02:51:37,140 --> 02:51:39,000
if you're too damn old for this job or not."

4622
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:42,360
And he inspired that joke that Reagan made

4623
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:45,300
where he was like, "I will not use age in this campaign.

4624
02:51:45,300 --> 02:51:46,920
I will not hold my opponent's youth

4625
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:48,780
and inexperience against him."

4626
02:51:48,780 --> 02:51:49,920
That was Ailes, man.

4627
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:52,470
You got, he did the Nixon Town Halls.

4628
02:51:52,470 --> 02:51:56,010
He did it all, he's a fucking genius.

4629
02:51:56,010 --> 02:51:57,510
And I'm not advocating necessarily

4630
02:51:57,510 --> 02:51:59,220
for the world he created for us,

4631
02:51:59,220 --> 02:52:02,010
but he did it and people should study him more.

4632
02:52:02,010 --> 02:52:03,930
If you're interested in media in particular,

4633
02:52:03,930 --> 02:52:05,400
that book is one of the most important books

4634
02:52:05,400 --> 02:52:06,233
you'll ever read.

4635
02:52:06,233 --> 02:52:07,440
- Yeah, you know what,

4636
02:52:07,440 --> 02:52:08,703
that quote just really connected with me.

4637
02:52:08,703 --> 02:52:09,553
- Yes. - 'Cause,

4638
02:52:11,250 --> 02:52:13,400
you know, there's all this talk about truth

4639
02:52:14,700 --> 02:52:16,890
and I think what people wanna,

4640
02:52:16,890 --> 02:52:19,260
they want to feel like they're in possession of the truth.

4641
02:52:19,260 --> 02:52:20,477
- Correct. - Not actually being

4642
02:52:20,477 --> 02:52:22,113
in the possession of the truth.

4643
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:25,590
- Yeah, I know. It's one of the, it hit me too.

4644
02:52:25,590 --> 02:52:27,840
Actually, Russell Crowe does an amazing job

4645
02:52:27,840 --> 02:52:30,510
of delivering that line in the Showtime miniseries.

4646
02:52:30,510 --> 02:52:32,940
So if you have the chance, you should watch it.

4647
02:52:32,940 --> 02:52:34,350
And look, this is the problem.

4648
02:52:34,350 --> 02:52:37,200
Liberals will be like, "Yeah, see these idiot Republicans."

4649
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:38,520
I'm like, yeah, you guys have bought

4650
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:40,350
a lot of crazy stupid shit too, okay?

4651
02:52:40,350 --> 02:52:42,570
And if actually I would say "liberal misinformation,"

4652
02:52:42,570 --> 02:52:45,300
quote unquote, is worse than Republican disinformation

4653
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:48,990
because it pervades the entire elite media like Russiagate

4654
02:52:48,990 --> 02:52:52,560
or Cambridge Analytica or any of these other hoaxes

4655
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:55,200
that have been foisted on the American people.

4656
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:57,090
The people who listen to The Daily

4657
02:52:57,090 --> 02:53:00,630
and from the New York Times are just as brainwashed,

4658
02:53:00,630 --> 02:53:03,270
lack of informed, wanna feel informed

4659
02:53:03,270 --> 02:53:05,610
as people who watch Fox News.

4660
02:53:05,610 --> 02:53:07,110
So let me just say that out there,

4661
02:53:07,110 --> 02:53:10,290
it's an equal opportunity cancer in the American people.

4662
02:53:10,290 --> 02:53:11,630
- Actually, we started early on

4663
02:53:11,630 --> 02:53:13,863
in the conversation talking about bubbles.

4664
02:53:16,530 --> 02:53:20,160
What's your advice about how to figure out

4665
02:53:20,160 --> 02:53:22,137
if you're in a bubble and how to get out of it?

4666
02:53:22,137 --> 02:53:24,150
- Oh, that's such a fantastic question.

4667
02:53:24,150 --> 02:53:26,610
Unfortunately, I think it comes really naturally

4668
02:53:26,610 --> 02:53:29,250
to someone like me because I'm the child of immigrants

4669
02:53:29,250 --> 02:53:31,230
and I was raised in College Station, Texas,

4670
02:53:31,230 --> 02:53:33,450
so I was always on the outside.

4671
02:53:33,450 --> 02:53:36,600
And when you're on the outside, this isn't a sob story.

4672
02:53:36,600 --> 02:53:38,010
It's a deeply useful skill

4673
02:53:38,010 --> 02:53:39,540
because when you're on the outside,

4674
02:53:39,540 --> 02:53:41,340
you're forced to kind of observe.

4675
02:53:41,340 --> 02:53:42,600
And you're like, "Oh."

4676
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:45,210
So like where I was raised was the Bible Belt

4677
02:53:45,210 --> 02:53:47,790
and people really, you know,

4678
02:53:47,790 --> 02:53:50,340
people were hardcore evangelical Christians.

4679
02:53:50,340 --> 02:53:52,290
And I could tell, I'm like, they really believe this stuff

4680
02:53:52,290 --> 02:53:53,404
and, you know, they,

4681
02:53:53,404 --> 02:53:56,400
you know, were always trying to proselytize and all of that.

4682
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:58,470
And then the other gift that my parents gave me is

4683
02:53:58,470 --> 02:54:00,210
I got to travel the entire world.

4684
02:54:00,210 --> 02:54:04,020
I probably visited 25, 30 countries by the time I was 18.

4685
02:54:04,020 --> 02:54:07,620
And one of the things that that gave me was the ability

4686
02:54:07,620 --> 02:54:11,340
to just put yourself in the brain of another person.

4687
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:13,860
So one of the reasons I'm really excited to go to Japan,

4688
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:17,670
and I picked it as a spot for my honeymoon, was because

4689
02:54:17,670 --> 02:54:20,430
Japan is a first world developed country

4690
02:54:20,430 --> 02:54:22,980
where the vast majority of them don't speak English.

4691
02:54:22,980 --> 02:54:26,430
It's distinguishably non-Western

4692
02:54:26,430 --> 02:54:28,380
and they just do shit their own way.

4693
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:31,020
So they have a subway, but it's not the same as ours.

4694
02:54:31,020 --> 02:54:33,390
They have restaurants, things don't work the same way.

4695
02:54:33,390 --> 02:54:35,910
They have, you know, I could go a laundry list.

4696
02:54:35,910 --> 02:54:39,600
Their entire philosophy of life, of the daily rhythm,

4697
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:42,840
even though it merges with service-based

4698
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:45,780
managerial capitalism and they're fucking good at it too,

4699
02:54:45,780 --> 02:54:47,940
they do it their own way.

4700
02:54:47,940 --> 02:54:51,120
So exposure to other countries in the world gave me,

4701
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:53,160
and also just being an outsider myself,

4702
02:54:53,160 --> 02:54:55,590
gave me a more detached view of the world.

4703
02:54:55,590 --> 02:54:56,970
So if you don't have that,

4704
02:54:56,970 --> 02:54:59,370
what I would encourage you is to flex that muscle.

4705
02:54:59,370 --> 02:55:03,030
So go somewhere that makes you uncomfortable.

4706
02:55:03,030 --> 02:55:04,650
This will be a very boomer take,

4707
02:55:04,650 --> 02:55:07,830
but I hate the fact that you have 5G everywhere you go

4708
02:55:07,830 --> 02:55:08,663
in the world.

4709
02:55:08,663 --> 02:55:09,990
Because some of the best experiences

4710
02:55:09,990 --> 02:55:13,860
I've ever had in my life is walking around Warsaw, Poland,

4711
02:55:13,860 --> 02:55:15,630
trying to find a bus station

4712
02:55:15,630 --> 02:55:19,080
to get my ass to Lithuania with a printed out bus ticket.

4713
02:55:19,080 --> 02:55:21,150
I have no idea where the street is.

4714
02:55:21,150 --> 02:55:23,370
I'm in a country where not that many people speak English.

4715
02:55:23,370 --> 02:55:25,530
We're pointing and gesturing, right,

4716
02:55:25,530 --> 02:55:26,850
and I figured it out.

4717
02:55:26,850 --> 02:55:27,690
And it was really used,

4718
02:55:27,690 --> 02:55:29,670
I got to meet a lot of cool Polish people.

4719
02:55:29,670 --> 02:55:30,510
Same in Thailand.

4720
02:55:30,510 --> 02:55:33,420
I've been in rural like bumfuck, Thailand, Colombia,

4721
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:36,090
places where people speak zero English.

4722
02:55:36,090 --> 02:55:40,230
And your ability to gesture and use pigeon

4723
02:55:40,230 --> 02:55:43,150
really connects you and gives you like the ability

4724
02:55:44,068 --> 02:55:46,410
to get an exposure to others.

4725
02:55:46,410 --> 02:55:48,540
And so, I know this is a very like

4726
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:50,640
wanderlust like travel thing,

4727
02:55:50,640 --> 02:55:53,520
but unironically, if you're raised in a bubble, pierce it.

4728
02:55:53,520 --> 02:55:56,040
Like that's the answer is seek something out

4729
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:57,450
that makes you uncomfortable.

4730
02:55:57,450 --> 02:55:58,560
So if you're raised rich,

4731
02:55:58,560 --> 02:56:00,270
you need to go spend some time with poor people.

4732
02:56:00,270 --> 02:56:02,940
- And consider that they might actually understand

4733
02:56:02,940 --> 02:56:03,960
the world better than you.

4734
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:05,040
- Well, in some respects.

4735
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:05,873
So I think a lot

4736
02:56:05,873 --> 02:56:07,650
of rich people have really screwed up personal lives.

4737
02:56:07,650 --> 02:56:09,960
So if you're poor and you really value family,

4738
02:56:09,960 --> 02:56:11,610
you say, "Oh, that's interesting."

4739
02:56:11,610 --> 02:56:13,620
There seems to be a fundamental trade off

4740
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:16,560
between extraordinary wealth and something that I value.

4741
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:19,230
But what can I take away from that person?

4742
02:56:19,230 --> 02:56:21,750
Oh, put my money in index funds.

4743
02:56:21,750 --> 02:56:25,080
Make sure that I am conscientious about my budgeting,

4744
02:56:25,080 --> 02:56:26,610
common sense shit, right?

4745
02:56:26,610 --> 02:56:29,400
And say vice versa.

4746
02:56:29,400 --> 02:56:32,100
People who are very wealthy get so caught up

4747
02:56:32,100 --> 02:56:35,310
in the rat race about their kids going to private school

4748
02:56:35,310 --> 02:56:36,330
and all of this.

4749
02:56:36,330 --> 02:56:38,730
And then, you know, they very rarely engage with,

4750
02:56:38,730 --> 02:56:39,690
there's that famous study

4751
02:56:39,690 --> 02:56:41,250
where they ask people on their deathbed

4752
02:56:41,250 --> 02:56:42,750
like what they valued in life.

4753
02:56:42,750 --> 02:56:43,777
And every single one of them was like,

4754
02:56:43,777 --> 02:56:45,930
"I wish I'd spend more time with my children,"

4755
02:56:45,930 --> 02:56:47,250
I think about that every time

4756
02:56:47,250 --> 02:56:50,040
that I am thinking about pursuing a new work endeavor

4757
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:52,680
or something that's gonna have me spend significant time

4758
02:56:52,680 --> 02:56:53,910
away from my wife.

4759
02:56:53,910 --> 02:56:57,300
And almost always these days,

4760
02:56:57,300 --> 02:56:59,760
now that I've achieved a certain level of success,

4761
02:56:59,760 --> 02:57:03,780
the answer is I'm not doing it unless you can come with me.

4762
02:57:03,780 --> 02:57:05,190
- One of the bubbles I'm really concerned

4763
02:57:05,190 --> 02:57:06,270
about is San Francisco bubble.

4764
02:57:06,270 --> 02:57:08,267
I visited there recently 'cause there's,

4765
02:57:08,267 --> 02:57:12,930
I have so many friends there that I respect deeply.

4766
02:57:12,930 --> 02:57:15,766
There's so many brilliant people-

4767
02:57:15,766 --> 02:57:17,130
- Absolutely, absolutely. - In San Francisco.

4768
02:57:17,130 --> 02:57:18,630
The Silicon Valley.

4769
02:57:18,630 --> 02:57:19,730
But there's just this,

4770
02:57:21,840 --> 02:57:23,100
I don't even want to criticize it,

4771
02:57:23,100 --> 02:57:25,020
but there's definitely a bubble.

4772
02:57:25,020 --> 02:57:26,100
- Yeah. - Of thought.

4773
02:57:26,100 --> 02:57:26,940
- I'm with you.

4774
02:57:26,940 --> 02:57:30,420
I'm friends with some SV, Silicon Valley people as well.

4775
02:57:30,420 --> 02:57:34,680
I'm similarly struck by that every time I go.

4776
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:36,570
And honestly, I do admire them,

4777
02:57:36,570 --> 02:57:40,710
because they, what I respect the most amongst entrepreneurs,

4778
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:42,960
business and political thinkers is systems thinking.

4779
02:57:42,960 --> 02:57:44,490
Nobody thinks systems better

4780
02:57:44,490 --> 02:57:45,780
than people who are in tech. - Yeah.

4781
02:57:45,780 --> 02:57:48,180
- Because they deal with global shit, right?

4782
02:57:48,180 --> 02:57:49,170
Not even just America.

4783
02:57:49,170 --> 02:57:51,090
They have to think about the whole world,

4784
02:57:51,090 --> 02:57:53,820
about the human being and his relationship with technology

4785
02:57:53,820 --> 02:57:57,120
And coding in some ways is an expression of the human mind

4786
02:57:57,120 --> 02:57:59,490
and about how that person wants to achieve this thing.

4787
02:57:59,490 --> 02:58:02,850
And how you mechanically can type that into a keyboard

4788
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:05,220
or even code something to code for you

4789
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:06,390
to be able to achieve that.

4790
02:58:06,390 --> 02:58:08,670
That's a remarkable accomplishment.

4791
02:58:08,670 --> 02:58:10,530
I do think those people,

4792
02:58:10,530 --> 02:58:13,920
and people like that too, who think very linearly

4793
02:58:13,920 --> 02:58:16,710
through math and they're, the geniuses are the ones

4794
02:58:16,710 --> 02:58:18,210
who can take their creativity

4795
02:58:18,210 --> 02:58:20,130
and merge it with linear thinking,

4796
02:58:20,130 --> 02:58:23,460
but I do think that that actually, those are the people

4797
02:58:23,460 --> 02:58:27,240
who probably most need to get out of the bubble,

4798
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:29,040
check themselves a little bit.

4799
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:31,410
And, look, it's really hard, you know,

4800
02:58:31,410 --> 02:58:33,990
once you achieve a certain level of economic success

4801
02:58:33,990 --> 02:58:36,300
and others, like what do most rich people do?

4802
02:58:36,300 --> 02:58:38,640
They close themselves off from the world, right?

4803
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:39,900
The vast majority of the time,

4804
02:58:39,900 --> 02:58:40,740
what do you do?

4805
02:58:40,740 --> 02:58:44,070
Economy is annoying, flying, they fly first class.

4806
02:58:44,070 --> 02:58:45,810
Living a small house is annoying.

4807
02:58:45,810 --> 02:58:47,490
They buy a bigger house.

4808
02:58:47,490 --> 02:58:49,050
Dealing with a lot of these inconveniences

4809
02:58:49,050 --> 02:58:49,883
of life is annoying.

4810
02:58:49,883 --> 02:58:51,060
You pay a little bit more to make sure

4811
02:58:51,060 --> 02:58:52,170
you don't have to do that.

4812
02:58:52,170 --> 02:58:54,600
There's a deep insidious thing within that.

4813
02:58:54,600 --> 02:58:56,760
Each one of those individual choices,

4814
02:58:56,760 --> 02:58:59,310
where the more and more removed that you get from that,

4815
02:58:59,310 --> 02:59:00,600
the more in the bubble that you are.

4816
02:59:00,600 --> 02:59:02,340
So you should actually seek out those experiences

4817
02:59:02,340 --> 02:59:05,373
or create them in a concerted way.

4818
02:59:06,810 --> 02:59:07,923
- Speaking of bubbles,

4819
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:10,170
Sam Harris.

4820
02:59:10,170 --> 02:59:11,003
- Oh.

4821
02:59:11,880 --> 02:59:13,590
- He has continued to criticize me

4822
02:59:13,590 --> 02:59:16,380
directly and indirectly, I think unfairly,

4823
02:59:16,380 --> 02:59:18,120
but I love Sam.

4824
02:59:18,120 --> 02:59:20,250
I deeply respect him.

4825
02:59:20,250 --> 02:59:22,530
Everybody should listen to the "Making Sense" podcast.

4826
02:59:22,530 --> 02:59:23,780
It always makes me think.

4827
02:59:24,690 --> 02:59:26,959
It's definitely in the rotation for me.

4828
02:59:26,959 --> 02:59:28,710
- That's a very admirable view.

4829
02:59:28,710 --> 02:59:33,570
- I mean, he's, I think, one of the sharpest minds

4830
02:59:33,570 --> 02:59:35,190
of our generation.

4831
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:36,887
And for a long time I looked up to him,

4832
02:59:36,887 --> 02:59:39,760
it was one of the weird moments for me to meet him

4833
02:59:40,650 --> 02:59:42,900
'cause you listen to somebody for such a long time.

4834
02:59:42,900 --> 02:59:44,230
- I feel that way with you.

4835
02:59:44,230 --> 02:59:45,063
(Lex laughing)

4836
02:59:45,063 --> 02:59:46,290
I'm serious.

4837
02:59:46,290 --> 02:59:48,641
- Yeah, it was, it's a beautiful moment.

4838
02:59:48,641 --> 02:59:49,474
I mean, same with Joe

4839
02:59:49,474 --> 02:59:50,582
and stuff like this. - Oh, absolutely.

4840
02:59:50,582 --> 02:59:51,527
- It's- - It is one

4841
02:59:51,527 --> 02:59:54,353
of the most surreal moments of your life

4842
02:59:54,353 --> 02:59:55,410
to be able to meet somebody

4843
02:59:55,410 --> 02:59:58,140
who you spend like hours listening to.

4844
02:59:58,140 --> 03:00:00,270
I actually think about that when people come up to me.

4845
03:00:00,270 --> 03:00:01,770
Because I'm like, oh, they're feeling what I felt

4846
03:00:01,770 --> 03:00:02,910
whenever I... - Yeah, uh-huh.

4847
03:00:02,910 --> 03:00:04,050
Yeah. - Yeah.

4848
03:00:04,050 --> 03:00:07,077
- And you have to like, you see it, you feel it,

4849
03:00:07,077 --> 03:00:08,430
and you have to celebrate that

4850
03:00:08,430 --> 03:00:09,986
because there's an intimacy to it.

4851
03:00:09,986 --> 03:00:12,480
- [Saagar] Uh-huh.

4852
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:14,580
- I think it's real that people really do form

4853
03:00:14,580 --> 03:00:17,190
a real connection, a real friendship.

4854
03:00:17,190 --> 03:00:18,300
It happens to be one way,

4855
03:00:18,300 --> 03:00:20,820
but I think it actually can upgrade

4856
03:00:20,820 --> 03:00:22,470
to a two-way pretty easily.

4857
03:00:22,470 --> 03:00:24,930
It happens with me like in a matter of like five minutes

4858
03:00:24,930 --> 03:00:27,330
when I meet somebody at an airport or something like that.

4859
03:00:27,330 --> 03:00:32,330
Anyway, Sam took a pretty strong position on Trump.

4860
03:00:32,370 --> 03:00:33,570
- And has for a long time.

4861
03:00:33,570 --> 03:00:38,490
- Yeah, he has been consistent and unwavering.

4862
03:00:38,490 --> 03:00:43,330
So he thinks that Trump is a truly dangerous person

4863
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:47,283
for a democracy, for maybe for the world.

4864
03:00:48,210 --> 03:00:49,920
Can you steel man his position?

4865
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:51,750
- Well, you see, I think a lot

4866
03:00:51,750 --> 03:00:53,580
of this podcast has been steelmanning it

4867
03:00:53,580 --> 03:00:56,460
because Sam is a big character matters guy.

4868
03:00:56,460 --> 03:00:59,250
Like, he focuses a lot on Trump's personality.

4869
03:00:59,250 --> 03:01:00,330
By the way, I'm like you,

4870
03:01:00,330 --> 03:01:01,560
I've listened to Sam Harris for years.

4871
03:01:01,560 --> 03:01:03,120
I bought his meditation app.

4872
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:06,030
So nobody's gonna accuse me of being some Sam Harris hater.

4873
03:01:06,030 --> 03:01:08,280
I listened to him for way before,

4874
03:01:08,280 --> 03:01:10,620
long before even Donald Trump was elected.

4875
03:01:10,620 --> 03:01:14,070
That's how far back I go with the Sam Harris podcast.

4876
03:01:14,070 --> 03:01:15,600
I have a lot of respect for the dude.

4877
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:18,210
I enjoy a lot of his older interviews.

4878
03:01:18,210 --> 03:01:21,330
I do think after Trump, he did succumb a little bit,

4879
03:01:21,330 --> 03:01:24,150
in my opinion, to the elite liberalism view,

4880
03:01:24,150 --> 03:01:27,240
both of the impetus behind Donald Trump

4881
03:01:27,240 --> 03:01:29,730
and why he was able to be successful.

4882
03:01:29,730 --> 03:01:32,520
So in some ways, very denigrating to the Trump voter,

4883
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:34,710
but also a fundamental misunderstanding

4884
03:01:34,710 --> 03:01:36,120
of the American presidency.

4885
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:38,910
Because like I said, he really is the one who believes that

4886
03:01:38,910 --> 03:01:40,620
that narcissism, that character,

4887
03:01:40,620 --> 03:01:43,620
and all of that that makes Trump tick itself will eventually

4888
03:01:43,620 --> 03:01:47,010
override any potential benefit that he could have in office.

4889
03:01:47,010 --> 03:01:50,280
And I just think that's a really wrong way of looking at it.

4890
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:54,570
And I mean, for example, I had this debate with Krystal,

4891
03:01:54,570 --> 03:01:57,420
and this gets to the whole Trump, you know,

4892
03:01:57,420 --> 03:01:59,250
talking about the enemy from within.

4893
03:01:59,250 --> 03:02:00,083
And she was like,

4894
03:02:00,083 --> 03:02:02,160
"He wants to prosecute his political opponents.

4895
03:02:02,160 --> 03:02:03,240
Do you disagree with that?"

4896
03:02:03,240 --> 03:02:04,890
And I was like, "No, I don't."

4897
03:02:04,890 --> 03:02:06,660
And she was like, "So you're not worried about it?"

4898
03:02:06,660 --> 03:02:08,370
And I go, "No, I'm not."

4899
03:02:08,370 --> 03:02:09,203
And she's like, "Well, how do you square that?"

4900
03:02:09,203 --> 03:02:12,900
And I was like, "Well, I actually unironically believe

4901
03:02:12,900 --> 03:02:14,490
in the American system

4902
03:02:14,490 --> 03:02:16,650
of institutional checks and balances,"

4903
03:02:16,650 --> 03:02:19,740
which kept him quote unquote "in check" last time around.

4904
03:02:19,740 --> 03:02:22,926
I also believe in democracy where,

4905
03:02:22,926 --> 03:02:24,450
you know, this is really interesting.

4906
03:02:24,450 --> 03:02:27,690
But you know, in 2022, a lot of the Republicans

4907
03:02:27,690 --> 03:02:29,940
who were the most vociferous about "Stop the Steal,"

4908
03:02:29,940 --> 03:02:32,370
they got their asses kicked at the ballot box.

4909
03:02:32,370 --> 03:02:36,120
You know, Americans also then in 2024 decided

4910
03:02:36,120 --> 03:02:37,950
to forgive some of that from Donald Trump.

4911
03:02:37,950 --> 03:02:39,720
It's definitely didn't help, right?

4912
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:42,870
But they were able to oversee that for their own interests.

4913
03:02:42,870 --> 03:02:46,290
As in democratically, people are able to weigh

4914
03:02:46,290 --> 03:02:47,550
in terms of checks and balances

4915
03:02:47,550 --> 03:02:50,340
what they should and should not challenge a politician by.

4916
03:02:50,340 --> 03:02:52,800
But also, we have the American legal system,

4917
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:55,800
and I also know the way that the institutions

4918
03:02:55,800 --> 03:02:58,170
in Washington themselves work that,

4919
03:02:58,170 --> 03:03:01,920
you know, fundamentally, the way that certain processes

4920
03:03:01,920 --> 03:03:04,200
and other things could play out will not play out

4921
03:03:04,200 --> 03:03:06,420
to some Hitlerian fantasy.

4922
03:03:06,420 --> 03:03:09,057
And this gets to the whole like Kamala

4923
03:03:09,057 --> 03:03:11,273
and them calling him a fascist and Hitler,

4924
03:03:11,273 --> 03:03:14,550
you know, you and I probably spent hours of our lives,

4925
03:03:14,550 --> 03:03:18,330
maybe more, thinking and reading about Adolf Hitler,

4926
03:03:18,330 --> 03:03:19,330
Weimar, Germany and a certain,

4927
03:03:19,330 --> 03:03:21,381
and I just find it so insulting, you know,

4928
03:03:21,381 --> 03:03:24,970
because it becomes this moniker of like fascist, you know,

4929
03:03:24,970 --> 03:03:27,430
I say these terms have meaning

4930
03:03:28,630 --> 03:03:30,660
beyond just the dictionary definition,

4931
03:03:30,660 --> 03:03:34,440
the circumstances through which Hitler is able to rise

4932
03:03:34,440 --> 03:03:37,440
to power are not the same as today.

4933
03:03:37,440 --> 03:03:41,100
It's like, stop denigrating America to the point

4934
03:03:41,100 --> 03:03:43,350
where you think like, really you should flip it around.

4935
03:03:43,350 --> 03:03:45,330
Why do you think America is Weimar, Germany?

4936
03:03:45,330 --> 03:03:47,100
That's a ridiculous thing to say.

4937
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:48,987
Do you unironically believe that?

4938
03:03:48,987 --> 03:03:50,220
No, you don't believe that.

4939
03:03:50,220 --> 03:03:54,210
So that is personally what drives me a little bit crazy.

4940
03:03:54,210 --> 03:03:58,350
And I think that Sam has found in a mental framework

4941
03:03:58,350 --> 03:03:59,430
where he's not willing,

4942
03:03:59,430 --> 03:04:02,460
he's not able to look past the man

4943
03:04:02,460 --> 03:04:04,410
and his quote unquote "danger."

4944
03:04:04,410 --> 03:04:08,100
And at the end of the day, his worldview was rejected

4945
03:04:08,100 --> 03:04:09,677
wholly by the American people.

4946
03:04:09,677 --> 03:04:12,390
And that, 'cause the character argument,

4947
03:04:12,390 --> 03:04:14,550
the fascist argument, the Hitler argument,

4948
03:04:14,550 --> 03:04:18,990
he's uniquely bad argument has been run twice before 2016

4949
03:04:18,990 --> 03:04:21,240
and in 2000, actually, all three times,

4950
03:04:21,240 --> 03:04:22,770
I guess it won in 2020.

4951
03:04:22,770 --> 03:04:24,240
But two out of the three times

4952
03:04:24,240 --> 03:04:25,650
Donald Trump has won the presidency.

4953
03:04:25,650 --> 03:04:26,850
And in his latest one,

4954
03:04:26,850 --> 03:04:29,670
where that argument has never been made before

4955
03:04:29,670 --> 03:04:30,960
for a longer period of time

4956
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:33,900
and more in strength by a political candidate,

4957
03:04:33,900 --> 03:04:35,280
was rejected completely.

4958
03:04:35,280 --> 03:04:37,710
And I would ask him to reconcile himself

4959
03:04:37,710 --> 03:04:39,630
to the America that he lives in.

4960
03:04:39,630 --> 03:04:41,820
- I think one thing maybe

4961
03:04:41,820 --> 03:04:43,350
to partially steel man his case,

4962
03:04:43,350 --> 03:04:45,660
but also just to steel man,

4963
03:04:45,660 --> 03:04:50,010
the way the world works is that there is some probability

4964
03:04:50,010 --> 03:04:54,480
that Kamala Harris will institute

4965
03:04:54,480 --> 03:04:55,890
a communist state.

4966
03:04:55,890 --> 03:04:59,910
And there is some probability that Donald Trump will indeed,

4967
03:04:59,910 --> 03:05:01,980
that like will fly a swastika.

4968
03:05:01,980 --> 03:05:05,280
- Right. - With and deport,

4969
03:05:05,280 --> 03:05:08,070
I don't know everybody who's not Scot-Irish.

4970
03:05:08,070 --> 03:05:09,240
Like, I don't know.

4971
03:05:09,240 --> 03:05:10,230
- Yeah. You and I are screwed then.

4972
03:05:10,230 --> 03:05:12,250
- Maybe is there a spirit test? Okay.

4973
03:05:12,250 --> 03:05:15,600
Like, but that probability is small and you have to,

4974
03:05:15,600 --> 03:05:19,047
if you allow yourself to focus on a particular trajectory

4975
03:05:20,700 --> 03:05:22,860
with a small probability,

4976
03:05:22,860 --> 03:05:24,867
it can become all encompassing

4977
03:05:24,867 --> 03:05:26,520
'cause you could see it, you could see a path.

4978
03:05:26,520 --> 03:05:28,740
There's certain character qualities to Trump.

4979
03:05:28,740 --> 03:05:29,573
- [Saagar] Yes.

4980
03:05:29,573 --> 03:05:31,770
- Where he wants to hold onto power.

4981
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:34,740
First of all, every politician wants to hold onto power.

4982
03:05:34,740 --> 03:05:39,740
Joe Biden, maybe because he's part of the machine,

4983
03:05:40,290 --> 03:05:43,500
can't even conceive of the notion of a third term.

4984
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:46,110
But he has the arrogance to want to hold onto power,

4985
03:05:46,110 --> 03:05:47,010
do everything he can.

4986
03:05:47,010 --> 03:05:47,850
- Absolutely.

4987
03:05:47,850 --> 03:05:49,470
- And like with Trump, I could see that

4988
03:05:49,470 --> 03:05:53,430
if it was very popular for him to have a third term,

4989
03:05:53,430 --> 03:05:56,670
I think he would not be the kind of person

4990
03:05:56,670 --> 03:05:59,190
who doesn't advocate for a third term.

4991
03:05:59,190 --> 03:06:00,180
- So what?

4992
03:06:00,180 --> 03:06:02,190
That would require the Senate

4993
03:06:02,190 --> 03:06:05,850
and the House or 70, what is it, 75% of the states to pass

4994
03:06:05,850 --> 03:06:07,920
and change the Constitution.

4995
03:06:07,920 --> 03:06:09,180
Do you think that's gonna happen?

4996
03:06:09,180 --> 03:06:10,230
No, I don't think it's gonna happen.

4997
03:06:10,230 --> 03:06:11,460
So I'm not that worried about it.

4998
03:06:11,460 --> 03:06:13,470
Now, you can make a norms argument,

4999
03:06:13,470 --> 03:06:15,120
and I actually think that's kind of fair,

5000
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:16,830
is that he's the norms buster.

5001
03:06:16,830 --> 03:06:19,410
But you know, with extraordinary candidates

5002
03:06:19,410 --> 03:06:21,090
and people like Trump,

5003
03:06:21,090 --> 03:06:22,620
you get the good and the bad.

5004
03:06:22,620 --> 03:06:23,940
There is the true duality,

5005
03:06:23,940 --> 03:06:27,840
like the norms he busts around foreign policy, I love.

5006
03:06:27,840 --> 03:06:30,480
The norms he busts around the economy, I love.

5007
03:06:30,480 --> 03:06:32,370
The norms he busts around

5008
03:06:32,370 --> 03:06:34,290
just so much of the American political system,

5009
03:06:34,290 --> 03:06:36,600
saying it, how it's et cetera, I love that.

5010
03:06:36,600 --> 03:06:37,433
You know what I hate?

5011
03:06:37,433 --> 03:06:39,540
This 2020 election bullshit.

5012
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:41,713
You know what else I hate, you know, this,

5013
03:06:41,713 --> 03:06:44,640
I don't know, just the lack of discipline

5014
03:06:44,640 --> 03:06:46,380
that I would want to think

5015
03:06:46,380 --> 03:06:47,610
that a great leader could have.

5016
03:06:47,610 --> 03:06:48,510
Like when he was president

5017
03:06:48,510 --> 03:06:50,640
and tweeting about Mika Brzezinski's facelift,

5018
03:06:50,640 --> 03:06:52,320
that was objectively ridiculous.

5019
03:06:52,320 --> 03:06:53,640
Like it was crazy. Okay.

5020
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:55,440
Was it funny? Yeah, but it was crazy.

5021
03:06:55,440 --> 03:06:58,800
Like, and it's not how I would conceive

5022
03:06:58,800 --> 03:07:01,440
and have conceived of some of my favorite presidents.

5023
03:07:01,440 --> 03:07:02,940
I wouldn't think that they would do that,

5024
03:07:02,940 --> 03:07:03,773
but that's what you get.

5025
03:07:03,773 --> 03:07:06,450
You know, you, everyone should be clear-eyed

5026
03:07:06,450 --> 03:07:07,830
about who this man is.

5027
03:07:07,830 --> 03:07:09,210
And that's another problem.

5028
03:07:09,210 --> 03:07:11,280
The deification of politicians is sick.

5029
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:14,417
It's sickening like about Trump, around Obama,

5030
03:07:14,417 --> 03:07:17,610
around like, these people are just people.

5031
03:07:17,610 --> 03:07:20,550
Like the idea that they are God-like creatures

5032
03:07:20,550 --> 03:07:22,320
with extraordinary judgment.

5033
03:07:22,320 --> 03:07:23,640
You know, one of the really cool things

5034
03:07:23,640 --> 03:07:25,500
about you and I's job is we actually get to meet

5035
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:26,610
very important people.

5036
03:07:26,610 --> 03:07:27,750
After you meet a few billionaires,

5037
03:07:27,750 --> 03:07:29,040
you're like, yeah, there's definitely something there.

5038
03:07:29,040 --> 03:07:30,961
But you know, some of them get lucky.

5039
03:07:30,961 --> 03:07:34,680
Like after you meet a few politicians, you're like,

5040
03:07:34,680 --> 03:07:36,750
oh, they're like, they're not that smart.

5041
03:07:36,750 --> 03:07:38,430
That was a rude awakening for me, by the way,

5042
03:07:38,430 --> 03:07:40,560
being here in Texas, reading about these people.

5043
03:07:40,560 --> 03:07:43,050
And pretty soon I was on Capitol Hill,

5044
03:07:43,050 --> 03:07:45,090
I was like 19 years old, I was an intern.

5045
03:07:45,090 --> 03:07:47,280
I'm actually interacting and I see them behave

5046
03:07:47,280 --> 03:07:48,390
in ridiculous manners

5047
03:07:48,390 --> 03:07:50,580
and, you know, whatever, treat people badly

5048
03:07:50,580 --> 03:07:51,780
or say something stupid.

5049
03:07:51,780 --> 03:07:54,450
And I was like, oh, I'm like, this is not "The West Wing."

5050
03:07:54,450 --> 03:07:56,231
I'm like, this is not like a book.

5051
03:07:56,231 --> 03:07:57,960
These people are just, this is just reality.

5052
03:07:57,960 --> 03:08:00,270
And the weirdest part of my life is I've now been

5053
03:08:00,270 --> 03:08:01,620
in Washington long enough.

5054
03:08:01,620 --> 03:08:04,140
I know some of the people personally,

5055
03:08:04,140 --> 03:08:06,510
the vice president of the United States,

5056
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:08,700
literally, the vice president-elect,

5057
03:08:08,700 --> 03:08:11,110
future cabinet secretaries, future, you know,

5058
03:08:11,110 --> 03:08:13,680
these people I literally have met, had dinner with,

5059
03:08:13,680 --> 03:08:16,740
had a drink with whatever, that's a wild thing.

5060
03:08:16,740 --> 03:08:19,140
And that's even more bringing you down to earth.

5061
03:08:19,140 --> 03:08:19,973
You're like, oh shit,

5062
03:08:19,973 --> 03:08:21,600
you're actually gonna have a lot of power.

5063
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:22,770
That's kind of scary.

5064
03:08:22,770 --> 03:08:23,940
But you're just a person.

5065
03:08:23,940 --> 03:08:25,337
And so even though you don't have to say,

5066
03:08:25,337 --> 03:08:27,840
I have my same life experience,

5067
03:08:27,840 --> 03:08:29,340
take it from me or anybody else

5068
03:08:29,340 --> 03:08:31,980
who's ever met really famous people,

5069
03:08:31,980 --> 03:08:33,990
rich, successful, powerful people,

5070
03:08:33,990 --> 03:08:34,823
they're just people.

5071
03:08:34,823 --> 03:08:35,910
There's nothing that,

5072
03:08:35,910 --> 03:08:37,860
there's some things that are unique about them,

5073
03:08:37,860 --> 03:08:41,040
but they have just as many human qualities as you

5074
03:08:41,040 --> 03:08:43,260
or anybody else who's listening to this right now.

5075
03:08:43,260 --> 03:08:45,420
- Yeah, there's, for each candidate,

5076
03:08:45,420 --> 03:08:47,720
Trump is probably the extreme version of that.

5077
03:08:48,734 --> 03:08:51,420
There's a distribution of the possible trajectories

5078
03:08:51,420 --> 03:08:52,980
that administration might result in.

5079
03:08:52,980 --> 03:08:54,870
- Yes. - And like,

5080
03:08:54,870 --> 03:08:56,940
the range of possible trajectories is just

5081
03:08:56,940 --> 03:08:58,000
much wider with Trump.

5082
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,600
- Yeah, you're describing like a Bayesian theory, right?

5083
03:09:00,600 --> 03:09:03,630
Like, and I think that's actually a really useful framework

5084
03:09:03,630 --> 03:09:05,850
for the world is that people are really too binary.

5085
03:09:05,850 --> 03:09:06,750
So like you said, you know,

5086
03:09:06,750 --> 03:09:08,220
there's a theoretical possibility,

5087
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:11,640
I guess, of a communist takeover of government

5088
03:09:11,640 --> 03:09:14,490
and of a fascist takeover of government

5089
03:09:14,490 --> 03:09:16,567
under Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.

5090
03:09:16,567 --> 03:09:20,490
You know, the realistic probability I would give it 0.05%

5091
03:09:20,490 --> 03:09:22,710
probably in both directions.

5092
03:09:22,710 --> 03:09:24,510
But there are, you know, there are a lot of things

5093
03:09:24,510 --> 03:09:25,830
that can happen that are bad,

5094
03:09:25,830 --> 03:09:27,750
that are not Hitlerian and or fascist.

5095
03:09:27,750 --> 03:09:29,580
There are a lot of things that happen that are really good,

5096
03:09:29,580 --> 03:09:32,460
that are not FDR New Deal style.

5097
03:09:32,460 --> 03:09:35,160
One of the worst things politicians do is they describe

5098
03:09:35,160 --> 03:09:37,410
themselves in false historical ways.

5099
03:09:37,410 --> 03:09:39,090
So in Washington,

5100
03:09:39,090 --> 03:09:42,870
one of the most overused phrases is made history.

5101
03:09:42,870 --> 03:09:46,740
And I'm like, you know, if you actually read history,

5102
03:09:46,740 --> 03:09:49,650
most of these things are just, they're not even footnotes.

5103
03:09:49,650 --> 03:09:52,290
They're the stuff that the historians flip past.

5104
03:09:52,290 --> 03:09:54,200
And they're like, what a stupid bucking thing.

5105
03:09:54,200 --> 03:09:56,670
I mean, and I'm talking about things that will,

5106
03:09:56,670 --> 03:09:58,320
that ruled American politics.

5107
03:09:58,320 --> 03:09:59,610
Like what if I told you that

5108
03:09:59,610 --> 03:10:02,490
the Panama Canal Treaty was one of the most important fights

5109
03:10:02,490 --> 03:10:04,290
in modern American politics?

5110
03:10:04,290 --> 03:10:06,750
Nobody thinks about that today.

5111
03:10:06,750 --> 03:10:09,480
It ruled American politics at that time, you know,

5112
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:11,130
it genuinely is a footnote,

5113
03:10:11,130 --> 03:10:12,500
but that's not how it felt at the time.

5114
03:10:12,500 --> 03:10:15,570
So that's another thing I want people to take away.

5115
03:10:15,570 --> 03:10:19,980
- You tragically missed the UFO hearings.

5116
03:10:19,980 --> 03:10:21,060
- Oh man, my brothers,

5117
03:10:21,060 --> 03:10:22,050
I'm really sad.

5118
03:10:22,050 --> 03:10:23,550
- My brothers. (chuckles)

5119
03:10:23,550 --> 03:10:24,383
- Let me tell you.

5120
03:10:24,383 --> 03:10:26,337
- Yeah. - I love them so much.

5121
03:10:26,337 --> 03:10:30,150
The UFO community are some of the best people

5122
03:10:30,150 --> 03:10:31,500
I've ever met in my life.

5123
03:10:31,500 --> 03:10:33,840
Shout out to my brother Jeremy Corbell,

5124
03:10:33,840 --> 03:10:35,700
to George Knapp, the OG,

5125
03:10:35,700 --> 03:10:38,160
to all of the people who fly from all around the world

5126
03:10:38,160 --> 03:10:39,420
to come to these hearings.

5127
03:10:39,420 --> 03:10:40,590
It was so fun.

5128
03:10:40,590 --> 03:10:42,630
I got to meet so many of them last time.

5129
03:10:42,630 --> 03:10:43,680
Just walk the rope line

5130
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:46,413
like as people were coming in, the excitement,

5131
03:10:48,924 --> 03:10:51,240
I truly love the UFO community.

5132
03:10:51,240 --> 03:10:52,350
Shout out to all of us.

5133
03:10:52,350 --> 03:10:53,213
- This is the second one, I guess.

5134
03:10:53,213 --> 03:10:54,360
- This is the second one.

5135
03:10:54,360 --> 03:10:55,860
- Do you hope they continue happening?

5136
03:10:55,860 --> 03:10:57,180
- It's gonna be a slow burn.

5137
03:10:57,180 --> 03:10:59,400
So one of the things I always tell the guys

5138
03:10:59,400 --> 03:11:04,080
and everybody is consider how long it took

5139
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:06,270
to understand the sheer insanity

5140
03:11:06,270 --> 03:11:08,490
of the CIA in the 1950s and '60s.

5141
03:11:08,490 --> 03:11:11,640
So if we think back to the church committee.

5142
03:11:11,640 --> 03:11:13,350
I forget the exact year of the church committee.

5143
03:11:13,350 --> 03:11:14,850
I think it was in the '70s,

5144
03:11:14,850 --> 03:11:18,360
the entire church committee and knowledge of why this,

5145
03:11:18,360 --> 03:11:21,600
of how the CIA and the FBI were up

5146
03:11:21,600 --> 03:11:24,420
to all of this insane shit throughout the '50s and '60s

5147
03:11:24,420 --> 03:11:27,120
is because some people broke into a warehouse,

5148
03:11:27,120 --> 03:11:28,650
discovered some documents,

5149
03:11:28,650 --> 03:11:31,980
got the names of programs which were able to be FOIA'd

5150
03:11:31,980 --> 03:11:33,870
and we were able to break open that case.

5151
03:11:33,870 --> 03:11:36,570
It would never have happened with real transparency,

5152
03:11:36,570 --> 03:11:38,010
like in the official process.

5153
03:11:38,010 --> 03:11:39,840
So we owe those people a great debt.

5154
03:11:39,840 --> 03:11:40,673
I guess I could say

5155
03:11:40,673 --> 03:11:42,903
now the statute of limitations has passed.

5156
03:11:43,860 --> 03:11:47,820
My point about the UFOs is I don't know what is real or not.

5157
03:11:47,820 --> 03:11:49,230
I have absolute confidence

5158
03:11:49,230 --> 03:11:51,900
and absolute ton is being hid from the American people

5159
03:11:51,900 --> 03:11:54,810
and that all of the official explanations are bullshit.

5160
03:11:54,810 --> 03:11:57,210
I have had the opportunity to interface

5161
03:11:57,210 --> 03:11:59,466
with some of the whistleblowers and other of the activists

5162
03:11:59,466 --> 03:12:01,761
and the community people who I trust,

5163
03:12:01,761 --> 03:12:04,050
people who have great credentials,

5164
03:12:04,050 --> 03:12:05,550
who have no reason to lie,

5165
03:12:05,550 --> 03:12:08,520
who have assured us that there is a lot going on

5166
03:12:08,520 --> 03:12:09,353
behind the scenes.

5167
03:12:09,353 --> 03:12:11,580
There has been too much misinformation

5168
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:14,550
and effort by the deep state to cover up this topic.

5169
03:12:14,550 --> 03:12:16,800
So I would ask people to keep the faith.

5170
03:12:16,800 --> 03:12:21,120
It's 2024 and we still don't have all the JFK files, okay?

5171
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:22,320
Everyone involved is dead.

5172
03:12:22,320 --> 03:12:24,090
There's no reason to let it go.

5173
03:12:24,090 --> 03:12:26,070
And even though we basically know what happened,

5174
03:12:26,070 --> 03:12:26,940
we don't know.

5175
03:12:26,940 --> 03:12:29,040
If you read that fantastic book,

5176
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,590
the Tom O'Neill book about the Manson murders.

5177
03:12:31,590 --> 03:12:34,230
I mean, again, you know, it took him 20 years to write

5178
03:12:34,230 --> 03:12:36,450
that book and he still didn't get the full story.

5179
03:12:36,450 --> 03:12:40,230
So sometimes it takes an extraordinarily long

5180
03:12:40,230 --> 03:12:41,550
agonizing period of time.

5181
03:12:41,550 --> 03:12:43,890
And I know how deeply frustrating that is.

5182
03:12:43,890 --> 03:12:45,990
But when you think about a secret,

5183
03:12:45,990 --> 03:12:49,290
a program and knowledge of this magnitude,

5184
03:12:49,290 --> 03:12:50,610
it would only make sense

5185
03:12:50,610 --> 03:12:52,622
that it would require a titanic effort

5186
03:12:52,622 --> 03:12:54,720
to reveal a titanic secret.

5187
03:12:54,720 --> 03:12:57,663
- You think Trump might be able to push further,

5188
03:12:58,620 --> 03:13:00,780
like aggressively break through the secrecy,

5189
03:13:00,780 --> 03:13:02,880
let's say even on the JFK files?

5190
03:13:02,880 --> 03:13:05,670
- I hope so, I have moderate confidence.

5191
03:13:05,670 --> 03:13:08,400
You know, RFK Junior has pushed him to do so.

5192
03:13:08,400 --> 03:13:10,200
I would like to think so.

5193
03:13:10,200 --> 03:13:12,090
At the same time I saw him got rolled last time.

5194
03:13:12,090 --> 03:13:13,680
So I'm, you know, I'll hold my breath.

5195
03:13:13,680 --> 03:13:14,730
- Why do you think that happens?

5196
03:13:14,730 --> 03:13:15,570
Why do you think it gets-

5197
03:13:15,570 --> 03:13:17,460
- Remember that whole interagency thing I told you about?

5198
03:13:17,460 --> 03:13:18,540
That's how it happens.

5199
03:13:18,540 --> 03:13:19,373
That's another thing.

5200
03:13:19,373 --> 03:13:21,000
You're presuming that the president has the power

5201
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:22,560
to declassify this stuff.

5202
03:13:22,560 --> 03:13:24,510
I'm saying that I'm not even sure we're there.

5203
03:13:24,510 --> 03:13:25,800
Like in terms of-

5204
03:13:25,800 --> 03:13:26,633
- So it's basic

5205
03:13:26,633 --> 03:13:27,466
like stability. - Yeah.

5206
03:13:27,466 --> 03:13:29,137
- He basically says like,

5207
03:13:29,137 --> 03:13:31,350
"I would like to declassify JFK files."

5208
03:13:31,350 --> 03:13:32,400
And they say, "Yes, sir,

5209
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:34,260
we'll get that to you in three months."

5210
03:13:34,260 --> 03:13:35,700
And three months comes by.

5211
03:13:35,700 --> 03:13:38,430
And then they're like, "Well, there's these hurdles."

5212
03:13:38,430 --> 03:13:39,787
- Well, the way you get around it is go,

5213
03:13:39,787 --> 03:13:40,710
"Let's release some.

5214
03:13:40,710 --> 03:13:43,230
But these in particular, there's national security secrets.

5215
03:13:43,230 --> 03:13:45,450
There's a good case for not releasing them X, Y and Z."

5216
03:13:45,450 --> 03:13:46,830
You know, it's like you get around that,

5217
03:13:46,830 --> 03:13:47,663
you go, "Oh, okay."

5218
03:13:47,663 --> 03:13:48,720
You know, that makes sense, you know.

5219
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:49,920
And again, he's a busy guy.

5220
03:13:49,920 --> 03:13:51,750
He's the president, he got way bigger shit to worry about.

5221
03:13:51,750 --> 03:13:52,620
So this is the,

5222
03:13:52,620 --> 03:13:53,970
that's the problem is that

5223
03:13:53,970 --> 03:13:55,920
unless you have that true urgency,

5224
03:13:55,920 --> 03:13:58,440
I mean, look, people of immense power have tried,

5225
03:13:58,440 --> 03:13:59,610
everyone forgets this.

5226
03:13:59,610 --> 03:14:01,890
John Podesta was the White House Chief of Staff.

5227
03:14:01,890 --> 03:14:04,350
He's a UFO true believer in his heart.

5228
03:14:04,350 --> 03:14:06,360
He tried, he's talked about it.

5229
03:14:06,360 --> 03:14:08,940
He tried at the top level,

5230
03:14:08,940 --> 03:14:11,520
the number two to the White House to get the Pentagon

5231
03:14:11,520 --> 03:14:13,200
and others to tell him what was going on

5232
03:14:13,200 --> 03:14:14,033
and they stonewalled him.

5233
03:14:14,033 --> 03:14:16,650
So people need to understand what you're up against.

5234
03:14:16,650 --> 03:14:18,327
And you know, I would,

5235
03:14:18,327 --> 03:14:20,130
and people are like, how is that even possible?

5236
03:14:20,130 --> 03:14:24,327
It's like, well, go read about the terror that LBJ

5237
03:14:24,327 --> 03:14:27,300
and the Kennedys and others had in confronting

5238
03:14:27,300 --> 03:14:28,320
J. Edgar Hoover,

5239
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:32,220
go and read how terrified, you know, Eisenhower,

5240
03:14:32,220 --> 03:14:34,440
and some of them were of the Dulles brothers.

5241
03:14:34,440 --> 03:14:35,273
They were scared.

5242
03:14:35,273 --> 03:14:37,170
Like they knew where the power lies.

5243
03:14:37,170 --> 03:14:39,243
So, you know, the presidency,

5244
03:14:40,590 --> 03:14:43,380
look, government, deep state, et cetera,

5245
03:14:43,380 --> 03:14:44,700
they've been there a long time

5246
03:14:44,700 --> 03:14:47,910
and they know what's happening and presidents come and go,

5247
03:14:47,910 --> 03:14:49,170
but they stay forever.

5248
03:14:49,170 --> 03:14:52,590
And so that's the paradigm

5249
03:14:52,590 --> 03:14:54,120
that you're gonna have to fight against.

5250
03:14:54,120 --> 03:14:56,670
- Yeah, I mean, it's a bit of a meme,

5251
03:14:56,670 --> 03:15:00,600
but I wonder how deep the deep state is.

5252
03:15:00,600 --> 03:15:02,760
- Much deeper than anyone can even imagine.

5253
03:15:02,760 --> 03:15:03,693
And the worst part is

5254
03:15:03,693 --> 03:15:06,420
with the deep state is it's not even individuals.

5255
03:15:06,420 --> 03:15:07,650
It's actually an ideology.

5256
03:15:07,650 --> 03:15:09,067
And ideology is the most power.

5257
03:15:09,067 --> 03:15:11,730
You know, people often think that

5258
03:15:11,730 --> 03:15:13,230
if we took money out of politics,

5259
03:15:13,230 --> 03:15:14,070
that it would change everything.

5260
03:15:14,070 --> 03:15:15,780
I'm not saying it wouldn't change everything,

5261
03:15:15,780 --> 03:15:17,250
but it wouldn't change a lot.

5262
03:15:17,250 --> 03:15:18,607
But people are like,

5263
03:15:18,607 --> 03:15:20,850
"Oh, so-and-so's only against universal healthcare

5264
03:15:20,850 --> 03:15:21,683
'cause they're getting paid."

5265
03:15:21,683 --> 03:15:22,516
I'm like, no, no, no.

5266
03:15:22,516 --> 03:15:23,700
That's not why they actually believe it.

5267
03:15:23,700 --> 03:15:26,700
Or it's like, "Oh, so-and-so's only wants to advocate

5268
03:15:26,700 --> 03:15:29,490
for war with Iran because they're on the payroll of APAC."

5269
03:15:29,490 --> 03:15:31,290
And it's like, well, yeah, the APAC trips

5270
03:15:31,290 --> 03:15:32,123
and the money helps,

5271
03:15:32,123 --> 03:15:34,920
but they think that, actually, the system itself,

5272
03:15:34,920 --> 03:15:38,760
this is a very Chomsky as systemic critique, is that,

5273
03:15:38,760 --> 03:15:41,970
any journalist worth their salt would never have the ability

5274
03:15:41,970 --> 03:15:43,560
to get hired in a mainstream.

5275
03:15:43,560 --> 03:15:45,360
So he's like, it's not that you're bad

5276
03:15:45,360 --> 03:15:46,470
in the mainstream media,

5277
03:15:46,470 --> 03:15:50,010
it's that anyone good is not allowed to be elevated

5278
03:15:50,010 --> 03:15:53,070
to your position because they have an ideology.

5279
03:15:53,070 --> 03:15:57,000
And so, you know, that is the most self-reinforcing,

5280
03:15:57,000 --> 03:15:58,680
pernicious mechanism of them all.

5281
03:15:58,680 --> 03:16:01,650
And that's really Washington in a nutshell.

5282
03:16:01,650 --> 03:16:03,540
- It's again, a bubble,

5283
03:16:03,540 --> 03:16:05,490
but a bubble that has a lot of power.

5284
03:16:05,490 --> 03:16:07,040
- Yes. - Who do you think

5285
03:16:07,040 --> 03:16:10,080
is the future of the Republican party after Trump?

5286
03:16:10,080 --> 03:16:12,690
What happens to Trumpism after Trump?

5287
03:16:12,690 --> 03:16:15,570
- Like you just said, Bayesian, let's take various theories.

5288
03:16:15,570 --> 03:16:16,500
- Yes. - Right?

5289
03:16:16,500 --> 03:16:20,043
So let's say it's '04, it's Bush Cheney.

5290
03:16:20,940 --> 03:16:23,070
In 2004, the day after the election,

5291
03:16:23,070 --> 03:16:24,030
I would've told you this,

5292
03:16:24,030 --> 03:16:26,490
we live in a Bible belt, Jesus land America,

5293
03:16:26,490 --> 03:16:28,860
this America wants to protect America,

5294
03:16:28,860 --> 03:16:31,240
a war on terror against Iraq

5295
03:16:32,520 --> 03:16:34,830
and the axis of evil

5296
03:16:34,830 --> 03:16:37,440
and American people just voted for George W. Bush.

5297
03:16:37,440 --> 03:16:38,880
And so I would've predicted

5298
03:16:38,880 --> 03:16:41,340
that it would've been somebody in that vein.

5299
03:16:41,340 --> 03:16:42,173
And they tried that.

5300
03:16:42,173 --> 03:16:44,880
His name was John McCann got blown the out by Barack Obama.

5301
03:16:44,880 --> 03:16:47,310
So I cannot sit here and confidently say,

5302
03:16:47,310 --> 03:16:48,935
- What year would you be able to predict Obama?

5303
03:16:48,935 --> 03:16:51,207
It was just his first time he gave the speech,

5304
03:16:51,207 --> 03:16:53,130
- The 2004 speech at the DNC.

5305
03:16:53,130 --> 03:16:55,020
That was his, we don't live in Black America,

5306
03:16:55,020 --> 03:16:57,870
white America, the John Kerry, DNC speech.

5307
03:16:57,870 --> 03:17:01,020
You honestly could not have predicted it until '07

5308
03:17:01,020 --> 03:17:02,760
whenever he actually announced his campaign

5309
03:17:02,760 --> 03:17:05,280
and activated a lot of anti-war energy.

5310
03:17:05,280 --> 03:17:06,570
I mean, maybe '06,

5311
03:17:06,570 --> 03:17:09,690
actually, I could have said in '06 if I was, you know,

5312
03:17:09,690 --> 03:17:11,216
kind of the contrarian man now

5313
03:17:11,216 --> 03:17:13,020
I'm like, yeah, there's a lot of anti-war energy.

5314
03:17:13,020 --> 03:17:14,700
I think the next president will be somebody

5315
03:17:14,700 --> 03:17:15,780
who's able to vote.

5316
03:17:15,780 --> 03:17:19,380
You know, the explosion of Keith Olbermann and MSNBC that,

5317
03:17:19,380 --> 03:17:21,120
it makes logical sense in hindsight,

5318
03:17:21,120 --> 03:17:23,280
but you know, at the same time you're going up against

5319
03:17:23,280 --> 03:17:25,680
the Clinton machine who's never lost an election.

5320
03:17:25,680 --> 03:17:27,183
So I would've been afraid.

5321
03:17:28,560 --> 03:17:29,580
I cannot confidently say,

5322
03:17:29,580 --> 03:17:32,310
so I'll say if things go in different directions,

5323
03:17:32,310 --> 03:17:34,800
if Trump is a net positive president,

5324
03:17:34,800 --> 03:17:36,150
then I think it'll be JD Vance,

5325
03:17:36,150 --> 03:17:39,960
his vice president who believes in the,

5326
03:17:39,960 --> 03:17:41,910
a lot of the things that I've talked about here today

5327
03:17:41,910 --> 03:17:44,880
about foreign policy restraint, about the working class,

5328
03:17:44,880 --> 03:17:49,260
about changing Republican attitudes to the economy.

5329
03:17:49,260 --> 03:17:51,750
And he would be able to build upon that legacy

5330
03:17:51,750 --> 03:17:53,910
in the way that George H.W Bush was able

5331
03:17:53,910 --> 03:17:55,800
to get elected off the back of Reagan.

5332
03:17:55,800 --> 03:17:58,110
But H.W Bush was fundamentally his own man.

5333
03:17:58,110 --> 03:17:59,520
He's a very misunderstood figure.

5334
03:17:59,520 --> 03:18:01,680
Very different than Ronald Reagan,

5335
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:03,720
didn't end up working out for him, but you know,

5336
03:18:03,720 --> 03:18:05,160
he did get himself elected once.

5337
03:18:05,160 --> 03:18:06,240
So that's one path.

5338
03:18:06,240 --> 03:18:08,700
That's if you have a net positive Trump presidency.

5339
03:18:08,700 --> 03:18:11,703
The other path is the '04 path that I just laid out.

5340
03:18:12,720 --> 03:18:15,630
If George W. Bush, if Trump does what Bush does,

5341
03:18:15,630 --> 03:18:19,710
misinterprets his mandate, screws things up, creates chaos,

5342
03:18:19,710 --> 03:18:22,170
and it makes it just generally annoying

5343
03:18:22,170 --> 03:18:23,940
to live in American society,

5344
03:18:23,940 --> 03:18:27,390
then you will see somebody in the Republican party.

5345
03:18:27,390 --> 03:18:29,430
I mean still it could even be JD Vance.

5346
03:18:29,430 --> 03:18:31,440
'cause he could say JD is my natural

5347
03:18:31,440 --> 03:18:32,730
and my chosen successor,

5348
03:18:32,730 --> 03:18:34,920
but then he would lose an election

5349
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:37,050
and then he would no longer be the so-called leader

5350
03:18:37,050 --> 03:18:38,250
of the Republican Party.

5351
03:18:38,250 --> 03:18:41,490
So I could see it swing in the other direction.

5352
03:18:41,490 --> 03:18:44,670
I could see, you know, Republicans or others,

5353
03:18:44,670 --> 03:18:46,290
let's say if it's a total disaster

5354
03:18:46,290 --> 03:18:48,810
and we'd get down like 20% approval ratings

5355
03:18:48,810 --> 03:18:51,810
and the economy is bad and stuff like that.

5356
03:18:51,810 --> 03:18:54,660
Glenn Youngkin or somebody like that

5357
03:18:54,660 --> 03:18:58,500
who's very diametrically opposed to Donald Trump,

5358
03:18:58,500 --> 03:19:01,470
or at least you know, aesthetically is somebody like that

5359
03:19:01,470 --> 03:19:03,150
who could rise from the ashes.

5360
03:19:03,150 --> 03:19:05,010
And I'm just saying like in terms of his aesthetic,

5361
03:19:05,010 --> 03:19:06,270
not him per se.

5362
03:19:06,270 --> 03:19:09,000
So there's a variety of different directions.

5363
03:19:09,000 --> 03:19:11,100
It's a big question about the Republican base.

5364
03:19:11,100 --> 03:19:13,560
I mean, a shit ton of people voted Republican now

5365
03:19:13,560 --> 03:19:15,300
for the first time ever.

5366
03:19:15,300 --> 03:19:17,250
So are they gonna vote in party primaries?

5367
03:19:17,250 --> 03:19:18,083
I don't know.

5368
03:19:18,083 --> 03:19:20,730
You know, the traditional party primary voter is like

5369
03:19:20,730 --> 03:19:24,215
a white boomer is like 58, 59,

5370
03:19:24,215 --> 03:19:26,430
is the Latino guy in California

5371
03:19:26,430 --> 03:19:28,290
who turned out to vote for Trump with a MAGA hat

5372
03:19:28,290 --> 03:19:30,480
and rolling around, you know,

5373
03:19:30,480 --> 03:19:32,400
suburban Los Angeles with that.

5374
03:19:32,400 --> 03:19:33,960
Is he gonna vote in the Republican party?

5375
03:19:33,960 --> 03:19:34,793
That could change,

5376
03:19:34,793 --> 03:19:36,960
so the type of candidate themselves could come.

5377
03:19:36,960 --> 03:19:39,030
So this just, it's way too early to say, you know,

5378
03:19:39,030 --> 03:19:42,210
we have so many variety paths that we go down.

5379
03:19:42,210 --> 03:19:45,390
- Yeah, I think Trump is a singular figure

5380
03:19:45,390 --> 03:19:49,613
in terms of like, if you support Trump there,

5381
03:19:51,390 --> 03:19:53,970
I just, there's a vibe.

5382
03:19:53,970 --> 03:19:56,370
I know Kamala has a vibe,

5383
03:19:56,370 --> 03:19:59,280
but there's definitely a vibe to Trump and MAGA

5384
03:19:59,280 --> 03:20:02,130
and I just, I think even with JD,

5385
03:20:02,130 --> 03:20:04,800
that that's no longer going to be there.

5386
03:20:04,800 --> 03:20:06,253
So if JD runs and wins,

5387
03:20:06,253 --> 03:20:08,430
that would be on principles

5388
03:20:08,430 --> 03:20:10,890
and he's a very different human being.

5389
03:20:10,890 --> 03:20:13,230
- He is so different than Trump, right?

5390
03:20:13,230 --> 03:20:14,850
You can see his empathy, right?

5391
03:20:14,850 --> 03:20:16,260
Remember in the VP debate

5392
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:17,520
when he was like, "Christ, have mercy"

5393
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:19,050
when Tim Wallace was talking about his son.

5394
03:20:19,050 --> 03:20:20,617
I mean, that's not something Donald Trump's saying,

5395
03:20:20,617 --> 03:20:23,942
okay, he's just not like in terms of,

5396
03:20:23,942 --> 03:20:25,100
I mean, you know,

5397
03:20:25,100 --> 03:20:27,030
and this, by the way, this is my own bubble test.

5398
03:20:27,030 --> 03:20:29,130
I have no idea how somebody listens to Trump

5399
03:20:29,130 --> 03:20:30,120
and JD Vance is like,

5400
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:31,950
Trump is the guy who should be the president over him.

5401
03:20:31,950 --> 03:20:33,600
I honestly, I don't get it.

5402
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:34,980
That's my own cards on the table.

5403
03:20:34,980 --> 03:20:39,060
I am in too much of a bubble where I am,

5404
03:20:39,060 --> 03:20:41,340
my bias is to, you know,

5405
03:20:41,340 --> 03:20:44,700
being well-spoken and being empathetic

5406
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:46,140
or at least being able to play empathetic

5407
03:20:46,140 --> 03:20:49,470
and being extremely well-read about the world and thoughtful

5408
03:20:49,470 --> 03:20:51,000
and somebody who's, you know,

5409
03:20:51,000 --> 03:20:53,250
somebody like him who's engaged in the political process,

5410
03:20:53,250 --> 03:20:55,200
but also has been able to retain his values

5411
03:20:55,200 --> 03:20:57,660
and be extremely well-articulate his worldview.

5412
03:20:57,660 --> 03:20:58,620
That's my bias.

5413
03:20:58,620 --> 03:21:01,050
That's who I would want to be the president.

5414
03:21:01,050 --> 03:21:03,090
But you know, that's a big country.

5415
03:21:03,090 --> 03:21:03,923
People think differently

5416
03:21:03,923 --> 03:21:04,807
- By the way. I Sure you're bias.

5417
03:21:04,807 --> 03:21:06,540
- Yeah. - And I sometimes try

5418
03:21:06,540 --> 03:21:08,100
to take myself out of that bubble.

5419
03:21:08,100 --> 03:21:11,310
Like it's maybe it's not important to have read a book

5420
03:21:11,310 --> 03:21:15,210
or multiples of books on history.

5421
03:21:15,210 --> 03:21:17,280
- I'm not saying everybody should be like me,

5422
03:21:17,280 --> 03:21:18,113
but that's my point.

5423
03:21:18,113 --> 03:21:21,090
I'm checking myself by being like, because of who I am,

5424
03:21:21,090 --> 03:21:22,350
that's how I see the world,

5425
03:21:22,350 --> 03:21:24,030
and that's how I would choose a leader.

5426
03:21:24,030 --> 03:21:26,640
But that is not how people vote, period.

5427
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:28,020
And I've, nothing has taught me

5428
03:21:28,020 --> 03:21:29,460
that more than this election.

5429
03:21:29,460 --> 03:21:31,410
- I wish they did, I mean, I don't know if that,

5430
03:21:31,410 --> 03:21:32,830
I don't know if that's the lesson to take away, I think.

5431
03:21:32,830 --> 03:21:35,010
- Yeah, but who are we to say people are allowed to do

5432
03:21:35,010 --> 03:21:35,843
what they want.

5433
03:21:35,843 --> 03:21:36,870
You know, I'm not gonna tell somebody how to vote.

5434
03:21:36,870 --> 03:21:39,573
- No, what I'm saying is you take everything Trump,

5435
03:21:40,800 --> 03:21:43,680
everything Trump is doing, everything, the whole,

5436
03:21:43,680 --> 03:21:45,720
the dance, all of it,

5437
03:21:45,720 --> 03:21:49,129
and add occasional saga like references

5438
03:21:49,129 --> 03:21:50,880
to history books.

5439
03:21:50,880 --> 03:21:52,590
I think that's just a better candidate.

5440
03:21:52,590 --> 03:21:53,423
- I agree with you.

5441
03:21:53,423 --> 03:21:56,406
I mean, listen, you know, it's my bias.

5442
03:21:56,406 --> 03:21:57,239
- Yeah. I don't know. - Yeah.

5443
03:21:57,239 --> 03:21:58,710
- I don't think that's bias.

5444
03:21:58,710 --> 03:22:01,170
I think that's not bubble thinking, I think.

5445
03:22:01,170 --> 03:22:02,340
- It's amazing to me, right?

5446
03:22:02,340 --> 03:22:05,160
Like listen to the JD interview with Rogan.

5447
03:22:05,160 --> 03:22:09,060
I mean JD, I mean, he'll drop obscure references

5448
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:12,480
to studies to like papers

5449
03:22:12,480 --> 03:22:15,450
that have come out, essays, books.

5450
03:22:15,450 --> 03:22:18,990
Like this is a very well-read high IQ,

5451
03:22:18,990 --> 03:22:22,770
well-thought out individual who also, you know,

5452
03:22:22,770 --> 03:22:25,380
has given his life to the political process, right?

5453
03:22:25,380 --> 03:22:28,620
And decided to like deal with all the bullshit

5454
03:22:28,620 --> 03:22:30,780
that this entire system is gonna throw at you

5455
03:22:30,780 --> 03:22:32,820
whenever you start to engage.

5456
03:22:32,820 --> 03:22:34,290
That's who I would wanna be president.

5457
03:22:34,290 --> 03:22:36,360
But you know, I'm biased, so what can I say?

5458
03:22:36,360 --> 03:22:37,890
- I like how you keep saying you're biased.

5459
03:22:37,890 --> 03:22:39,390
- Yeah. - As if there's some percent

5460
03:22:39,390 --> 03:22:42,180
of the population doesn't like people to read at all.

5461
03:22:42,180 --> 03:22:43,013
Okay.

5462
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:44,820
What about the future?

5463
03:22:44,820 --> 03:22:47,310
You kind of hinted at it the future of the Democratic Party.

5464
03:22:47,310 --> 03:22:49,260
- Yeah. - Did you see any talent

5465
03:22:49,260 --> 03:22:50,430
out there that's promising?

5466
03:22:50,430 --> 03:22:51,720
Is it gonna be Obama-like figure

5467
03:22:51,720 --> 03:22:53,070
that just rolls out of nowhere?

5468
03:22:53,070 --> 03:22:54,870
- Clinton is the better example

5469
03:22:54,870 --> 03:22:58,230
because the Democratic Party was destroyed for 12 years,

5470
03:22:58,230 --> 03:23:01,830
from 1980, the 1980 election to 1992.

5471
03:23:01,830 --> 03:23:03,780
They're 12 years out of power

5472
03:23:03,780 --> 03:23:07,380
in periods of that long of an era,

5473
03:23:07,380 --> 03:23:10,470
it takes somebody literally brand new who is not tainted

5474
03:23:10,470 --> 03:23:13,080
by the previous to convince the base that you can won

5475
03:23:13,080 --> 03:23:13,950
and convince the country

5476
03:23:13,950 --> 03:23:15,540
that you're going in a new direction.

5477
03:23:15,540 --> 03:23:19,140
So I would not put my money on anybody tainted

5478
03:23:19,140 --> 03:23:21,900
by the Great Awokening by TDS,

5479
03:23:21,900 --> 03:23:23,910
by the insanity of the Trump era

5480
03:23:23,910 --> 03:23:25,787
that has to be somebody post that

5481
03:23:25,787 --> 03:23:29,280
and/or somebody who is able to reform themselves.

5482
03:23:29,280 --> 03:23:30,720
It will, in my opinion,

5483
03:23:30,720 --> 03:23:35,720
it will likely not be any establishment politician of today

5484
03:23:35,790 --> 03:23:37,950
who will emerge for the future.

5485
03:23:37,950 --> 03:23:39,813
Like I said, my dark horse is Dean,

5486
03:23:40,894 --> 03:23:42,690
I think the Democratic base is gonna give Dean

5487
03:23:42,690 --> 03:23:45,795
a shit ton of credit, and they should, for him being out.

5488
03:23:45,795 --> 03:23:47,010
- Interesting. - And look, let's be honest,

5489
03:23:47,010 --> 03:23:49,650
he is a no-name congressman from Minnesota.

5490
03:23:49,650 --> 03:23:51,210
Nobody cared who Dean Phillips was,

5491
03:23:51,210 --> 03:23:54,000
but just like Obama, he had courage and he came out

5492
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:55,890
and spoke early when it mattered.

5493
03:23:55,890 --> 03:23:58,020
And by doing that, he showed good judgment

5494
03:23:58,020 --> 03:23:59,970
and he showed that he's willing to take risks.

5495
03:23:59,970 --> 03:24:02,220
So I would hope in America's political system

5496
03:24:02,220 --> 03:24:03,537
that we award something like that.

5497
03:24:03,537 --> 03:24:05,940
And I do think the Democrats will reward him,

5498
03:24:05,940 --> 03:24:07,740
but I'm not saying it'll be him per se,

5499
03:24:07,740 --> 03:24:09,827
but it will be a figure like that

5500
03:24:09,827 --> 03:24:12,300
who is not nationally known,

5501
03:24:12,300 --> 03:24:14,520
who has read the tea leaves correctly,

5502
03:24:14,520 --> 03:24:15,720
who took guesses

5503
03:24:15,720 --> 03:24:17,880
and did things differently than everybody else.

5504
03:24:17,880 --> 03:24:22,320
And most of all, I'm hoping that heterodox attitudes,

5505
03:24:22,320 --> 03:24:26,220
ideas, behaviors, by definition after a blowout,

5506
03:24:26,220 --> 03:24:28,260
those will likely be the ones that are rewarded.

5507
03:24:28,260 --> 03:24:29,160
So I cannot give a name,

5508
03:24:29,160 --> 03:24:30,454
but I can just describe the circumstances

5509
03:24:30,454 --> 03:24:31,440
for what it will look like.

5510
03:24:31,440 --> 03:24:33,510
- Can you imagine an amorphous figure

5511
03:24:33,510 --> 03:24:36,180
that's a progressive populist?

5512
03:24:36,180 --> 03:24:38,250
- It would be very difficult at this point

5513
03:24:38,250 --> 03:24:39,990
just because a huge portion

5514
03:24:39,990 --> 03:24:44,190
of the multiracial working class has shifted to the right.

5515
03:24:44,190 --> 03:24:45,660
But I could see it,

5516
03:24:45,660 --> 03:24:47,880
I mean, look, people change their minds all the time.

5517
03:24:47,880 --> 03:24:51,180
Like there are people out there who voted for Barack Obama

5518
03:24:51,180 --> 03:24:53,220
who've now voted for Donald Trump three times.

5519
03:24:53,220 --> 03:24:55,890
So, you know, a lot can change in this country.

5520
03:24:55,890 --> 03:24:58,380
If you make a credible case, you've got a track record,

5521
03:24:58,380 --> 03:24:59,730
you speak authentically,

5522
03:24:59,730 --> 03:25:04,730
and you can try to divide the country along class lines

5523
03:25:04,740 --> 03:25:06,930
and be authentic and real about it.

5524
03:25:06,930 --> 03:25:08,190
Maybe I think you have a shot.

5525
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:11,040
I still think you're probably gonna get dinged on culture,

5526
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:13,170
just because I think this election has really showed us

5527
03:25:13,170 --> 03:25:15,030
how important immigration and culture is.

5528
03:25:15,030 --> 03:25:17,040
But you know, actually,

5529
03:25:17,040 --> 03:25:19,620
what the left populist should pray for,

5530
03:25:19,620 --> 03:25:20,580
and they won't admit this,

5531
03:25:20,580 --> 03:25:22,470
is that Trump actually solves immigration.

5532
03:25:22,470 --> 03:25:24,720
Like in terms of changing the status quo.

5533
03:25:24,720 --> 03:25:28,050
You know how, in the way that the Supreme Court just ended

5534
03:25:28,050 --> 03:25:29,640
the conversation around gay marriage.

5535
03:25:29,640 --> 03:25:31,140
So all Republicans were like, yeah, whatever.

5536
03:25:31,140 --> 03:25:32,370
We support gay marriage.

5537
03:25:32,370 --> 03:25:33,810
Because they're like, that's the law of the land.

5538
03:25:33,810 --> 03:25:35,160
It is what it is.

5539
03:25:35,160 --> 03:25:36,210
They should just hope

5540
03:25:36,210 --> 03:25:40,080
that their unpopular issue is resolved by the president

5541
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:42,480
and thus they just don't have to talk about it anymore.

5542
03:25:42,480 --> 03:25:45,030
And now the battleground is actually favorable for them.

5543
03:25:45,030 --> 03:25:46,890
They get to talk about the economy and abortion.

5544
03:25:46,890 --> 03:25:50,280
So their least popular issue gets solved

5545
03:25:50,280 --> 03:25:53,010
by the president by consensus from his mandate.

5546
03:25:53,010 --> 03:25:55,140
And then they can run on a brand new platform

5547
03:25:55,140 --> 03:25:56,850
for the new issues that are facing America.

5548
03:25:56,850 --> 03:25:59,640
- All right, let's put our historian hat back on.

5549
03:25:59,640 --> 03:26:01,530
- Okay. - Will the American Empire

5550
03:26:01,530 --> 03:26:02,730
collapse one day?

5551
03:26:02,730 --> 03:26:07,110
And if it does, when it does, what would be the reason?

5552
03:26:07,110 --> 03:26:08,926
- Statistically likely,

5553
03:26:08,926 --> 03:26:11,340
(Lex laughing) the, (laughs)

5554
03:26:11,340 --> 03:26:12,813
statistically yes.

5555
03:26:14,040 --> 03:26:15,690
You know, it's the famous Fight Club quote.

5556
03:26:15,690 --> 03:26:16,950
It's like, "On a long enough timeline,

5557
03:26:16,950 --> 03:26:19,710
the survival rate for everything drops to zero."

5558
03:26:19,710 --> 03:26:21,930
And you know...

5559
03:26:21,930 --> 03:26:23,700
- I like for all the books you've quoted.

5560
03:26:23,700 --> 03:26:24,778
- Yeah. - You went to Fight Club.

5561
03:26:24,778 --> 03:26:26,220
- Okay. - I guess the movie, right?

5562
03:26:26,220 --> 03:26:28,680
- The book's good though, people should read that too,

5563
03:26:28,680 --> 03:26:30,690
in terms of why,

5564
03:26:30,690 --> 03:26:33,600
again, statistically the answer's quite simple.

5565
03:26:33,600 --> 03:26:38,600
It usually comes back to a series of unpopular wars,

5566
03:26:39,210 --> 03:26:43,410
which are pursued because of the elite's interests.

5567
03:26:43,410 --> 03:26:48,090
Then it usually leads to a miscalculation

5568
03:26:48,090 --> 03:26:50,670
and a not a catastrophic defeat normally,

5569
03:26:50,670 --> 03:26:52,533
it comes gradually.

5570
03:26:53,550 --> 03:26:57,000
And most of the times when these things end,

5571
03:26:57,000 --> 03:26:59,100
the crazy part is most people who are living

5572
03:26:59,100 --> 03:27:00,600
through end of empire have no idea

5573
03:27:00,600 --> 03:27:02,280
that they're living through the end of the empire.

5574
03:27:02,280 --> 03:27:04,537
And I actually think about that a lot from, you know,

5575
03:27:04,537 --> 03:27:07,650
"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" by Edward Gibbon.

5576
03:27:07,650 --> 03:27:09,420
Actually, your episode on Rome was fantastic.

5577
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:10,260
People should go listen to that.

5578
03:27:10,260 --> 03:27:11,520
So there you go.

5579
03:27:11,520 --> 03:27:13,110
Another really good one.

5580
03:27:13,110 --> 03:27:15,330
I like to think a lot about the British Empire

5581
03:27:15,330 --> 03:27:17,730
and if what eventually led to that collapse,

5582
03:27:17,730 --> 03:27:22,730
and nobody in 1919 said the British Empires just collapsed,

5583
03:27:22,800 --> 03:27:24,540
basically, nobody still thought that.

5584
03:27:24,540 --> 03:27:26,940
They were like, yeah, the first World War is horrible.

5585
03:27:26,940 --> 03:27:29,580
But actually, we came out of this okay, we still have India,

5586
03:27:29,580 --> 03:27:31,770
you know, we still have all these African colonies

5587
03:27:31,770 --> 03:27:35,130
and all that, but you know, long periods of servitude

5588
03:27:35,130 --> 03:27:38,220
of debt to the United States of degradation,

5589
03:27:38,220 --> 03:27:40,830
of social upheaval, of bolshevism,

5590
03:27:40,830 --> 03:27:42,840
of American industrial might.

5591
03:27:42,840 --> 03:27:44,790
And next thing you know,

5592
03:27:44,790 --> 03:27:46,590
you find yourself at Potsdam

5593
03:27:46,590 --> 03:27:48,300
and Churchill's like, "Holy shit,

5594
03:27:48,300 --> 03:27:51,000
I have barely any power in this room," right?

5595
03:27:51,000 --> 03:27:54,330
So it revolutions happened slowly and then all at once.

5596
03:27:54,330 --> 03:27:56,880
And so could you really put a, you know,

5597
03:27:56,880 --> 03:27:59,460
a real like pin in the end of the British Empire?

5598
03:27:59,460 --> 03:28:01,770
It took almost 40 years for it to end.

5599
03:28:01,770 --> 03:28:05,340
So America's empire will eventually end

5600
03:28:05,340 --> 03:28:08,250
either from rising geopolitical competition,

5601
03:28:08,250 --> 03:28:11,100
likely China, could be India, nobody knows.

5602
03:28:11,100 --> 03:28:14,490
It will likely be because of being overstretched

5603
03:28:14,490 --> 03:28:19,200
of an elite capture is usually the reason why.

5604
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:23,677
And a misreading of what made your original society work,

5605
03:28:23,677 --> 03:28:25,650
you know, in the first place.

5606
03:28:25,650 --> 03:28:27,840
And that is one where I honestly,

5607
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:30,540
like all three of those things will happen all at once.

5608
03:28:30,540 --> 03:28:33,240
And it will happen over an extremely long period of time.

5609
03:28:33,240 --> 03:28:35,580
And it's very difficult to predict.

5610
03:28:35,580 --> 03:28:37,303
I would not bet against America right now.

5611
03:28:37,303 --> 03:28:38,562
I think we have a lot of fundamental strengths.

5612
03:28:38,562 --> 03:28:40,380
It's such a unique and dynamic country.

5613
03:28:40,380 --> 03:28:42,150
It really is fucking crazy.

5614
03:28:42,150 --> 03:28:43,362
Every time I travel the world,

5615
03:28:43,362 --> 03:28:45,840
as much as I love all these different places I go,

5616
03:28:45,840 --> 03:28:49,170
man, I just, I love the United States so much.

5617
03:28:49,170 --> 03:28:50,550
You'll love it more when you leave.

5618
03:28:50,550 --> 03:28:51,930
I really, I really believe that so.

5619
03:28:51,930 --> 03:28:54,330
- Yeah, and it's nice to remember

5620
03:28:54,330 --> 03:28:57,540
how quickly the public opinion shifts.

5621
03:28:57,540 --> 03:29:00,913
Like we're very dynamic and adaptable, which, and annoys me.

5622
03:29:00,913 --> 03:29:02,910
I understand that's part of the political discourse,

5623
03:29:02,910 --> 03:29:05,940
saying like, if Trump wins, it's the end of America.

5624
03:29:05,940 --> 03:29:07,830
If Kamala wins, it's the end of America.

5625
03:29:07,830 --> 03:29:08,700
- So stupid.

5626
03:29:08,700 --> 03:29:09,810
Yeah. - But I,

5627
03:29:09,810 --> 03:29:11,490
I understand that the radical nature

5628
03:29:11,490 --> 03:29:13,863
of that discourse is necessary to,

5629
03:29:13,863 --> 03:29:15,000
like who mentioned-

5630
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:17,370
- Yeah, to drive out votes. - To drive up votes.

5631
03:29:17,370 --> 03:29:19,740
- I like to think about Americans in 1866.

5632
03:29:19,740 --> 03:29:22,560
I cannot imagine going through a war where some x percent,

5633
03:29:22,560 --> 03:29:24,210
I think it was like 2 or 3% or whatever,

5634
03:29:24,210 --> 03:29:26,250
the entire population was just killed.

5635
03:29:26,250 --> 03:29:29,100
Our president, who was this visionary genius

5636
03:29:29,100 --> 03:29:31,710
who were blessed to have, is assassinated

5637
03:29:31,710 --> 03:29:33,240
at Forks Theater immediately

5638
03:29:33,240 --> 03:29:35,160
after the surrender of Lee.

5639
03:29:35,160 --> 03:29:36,810
Andrew Johnson, who's a bumbling,

5640
03:29:36,810 --> 03:29:39,570
like fucktard is the one who is in charge.

5641
03:29:39,570 --> 03:29:42,690
And you know, we are having all these insane crises

5642
03:29:42,690 --> 03:29:44,700
over like internal management

5643
03:29:44,700 --> 03:29:47,130
while we're also trying to decide

5644
03:29:47,130 --> 03:29:48,780
like this new order in the South

5645
03:29:48,780 --> 03:29:49,950
and whether to bring these people,

5646
03:29:49,950 --> 03:29:51,820
how to bring these people back into the union.

5647
03:29:51,820 --> 03:29:54,963
I mean, I would've despaired like in that year,

5648
03:29:54,963 --> 03:29:57,210
I've like, it's over, this is it.

5649
03:29:57,210 --> 03:29:59,430
You know the war, I'd be like, was it worth anything?

5650
03:29:59,430 --> 03:30:01,770
You know, if Andrew Johnson is gonna be doing this,

5651
03:30:01,770 --> 03:30:04,380
or even in the South, I mean, I can't even imagine

5652
03:30:04,380 --> 03:30:05,587
for what they were going through too.

5653
03:30:05,587 --> 03:30:07,200
You know, they have to go home

5654
03:30:07,200 --> 03:30:09,030
and their entire cities are burned to the ground

5655
03:30:09,030 --> 03:30:10,230
and they're trying to readjust

5656
03:30:10,230 --> 03:30:11,550
and you know, their entire,

5657
03:30:11,550 --> 03:30:14,550
economy and way of life is overthrown in five years.

5658
03:30:14,550 --> 03:30:17,070
I mean, that's an insane time to be alive.

5659
03:30:17,070 --> 03:30:17,903
And what do we know?

5660
03:30:17,903 --> 03:30:22,830
It worked out, you know, by 1890s or so,

5661
03:30:22,830 --> 03:30:24,750
there were people shaking hands, you know, union.

5662
03:30:24,750 --> 03:30:29,700
And there's a cool video on YouTube actually of FDR

5663
03:30:29,700 --> 03:30:32,550
who is addressing some of the last Gettysburg veterans,

5664
03:30:32,550 --> 03:30:34,920
I think it was like the 75th anniversary or whatever.

5665
03:30:34,920 --> 03:30:36,720
And you can literally see these old men

5666
03:30:36,720 --> 03:30:40,140
who are shaking hands across the stone wall.

5667
03:30:40,140 --> 03:30:41,610
It gives me hope. Yeah.

5668
03:30:41,610 --> 03:30:43,290
- Let's linger on that hope.

5669
03:30:43,290 --> 03:30:46,680
What is the source of optimism you have

5670
03:30:46,680 --> 03:30:48,660
for the 21st century,

5671
03:30:48,660 --> 03:30:51,480
for the century beyond that,

5672
03:30:51,480 --> 03:30:54,990
for human civilization in general is, you know,

5673
03:30:54,990 --> 03:30:58,713
it's easy to learn cynical lessons from history, right?

5674
03:30:59,610 --> 03:31:02,130
That shit eventually goes wrong,

5675
03:31:02,130 --> 03:31:04,230
but sometimes it doesn't.

5676
03:31:04,230 --> 03:31:06,270
So what gives you hope?

5677
03:31:06,270 --> 03:31:10,770
- I think that the fundamentals

5678
03:31:10,770 --> 03:31:12,630
of what makes humanity great

5679
03:31:12,630 --> 03:31:15,270
and has for a long time are best expressed

5680
03:31:15,270 --> 03:31:17,160
in the American character.

5681
03:31:17,160 --> 03:31:19,920
And that despite all of our problems,

5682
03:31:19,920 --> 03:31:22,950
that as a country with our ethos,

5683
03:31:22,950 --> 03:31:24,510
a lot of the stuff we talked about today,

5684
03:31:24,510 --> 03:31:26,580
individualism, the frontier mindset,

5685
03:31:26,580 --> 03:31:28,140
the blessings of geography,

5686
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:29,910
the blessings of our economy,

5687
03:31:29,910 --> 03:31:32,370
of the way that we're able to just incorporate

5688
03:31:32,370 --> 03:31:34,020
different cultures and the best of each

5689
03:31:34,020 --> 03:31:35,760
and put them all together,

5690
03:31:35,760 --> 03:31:38,670
give us the best opportunity to succeed

5691
03:31:38,670 --> 03:31:40,950
and to accomplish awesome things.

5692
03:31:40,950 --> 03:31:42,810
We're the country that put a man on the moon,

5693
03:31:42,810 --> 03:31:44,991
which is the epitome of the human spirit.

5694
03:31:44,991 --> 03:31:47,910
I hope to see more of that.

5695
03:31:47,910 --> 03:31:50,430
And you know, I think last time I was here I shouted out,

5696
03:31:50,430 --> 03:31:52,110
and I love Antarctic exploration.

5697
03:31:52,110 --> 03:31:53,310
I've read basically every book

5698
03:31:53,310 --> 03:31:55,770
that there is on the exploration of Antarctica.

5699
03:31:55,770 --> 03:31:58,140
And one of the reasons I love to do so is because

5700
03:31:58,140 --> 03:32:00,750
there is no reason to care about Antarctica.

5701
03:32:00,750 --> 03:32:03,300
None, there's nothing down there. Zero.

5702
03:32:03,300 --> 03:32:07,080
Going to the South Pole is a truly useless exercise.

5703
03:32:07,080 --> 03:32:09,780
And yet, we went,

5704
03:32:09,780 --> 03:32:11,850
we went twice, actually two people went there

5705
03:32:11,850 --> 03:32:14,280
in the span of five weeks and they competed to do so.

5706
03:32:14,280 --> 03:32:16,440
- Yeah. - And the spirit

5707
03:32:16,440 --> 03:32:20,010
that propelled Amundsen and Scott's expedition

5708
03:32:20,010 --> 03:32:22,020
and people like Shackleton who's like,

5709
03:32:22,020 --> 03:32:24,630
if you were to ask me my hero of all heroes,

5710
03:32:24,630 --> 03:32:28,080
it's Ernest Shackleton is because his spirit,

5711
03:32:28,080 --> 03:32:30,180
I think lives on in the United States.

5712
03:32:30,180 --> 03:32:32,160
It unfortunately died in Great Britain.

5713
03:32:32,160 --> 03:32:35,550
And interestingly enough, the Brits even understand that.

5714
03:32:35,550 --> 03:32:36,600
They're like, "It's very interesting

5715
03:32:36,600 --> 03:32:38,760
how popular Shackleton is in America."

5716
03:32:38,760 --> 03:32:41,550
And even though he was Irish

5717
03:32:41,550 --> 03:32:43,020
and he was a British subject,

5718
03:32:43,020 --> 03:32:44,670
to me, he's a spiritual American.

5719
03:32:44,670 --> 03:32:47,280
And I think that his spirit lives on within us

5720
03:32:47,280 --> 03:32:50,010
and has always been here to a certain extent.

5721
03:32:50,010 --> 03:32:52,680
And everywhere else, I think it's dying.

5722
03:32:52,680 --> 03:32:55,530
But here, I love it here,

5723
03:32:55,530 --> 03:32:56,790
there's so many cool things about America.

5724
03:32:56,790 --> 03:32:57,990
People move around all the time.

5725
03:32:57,990 --> 03:33:00,690
They buy new houses, they start families.

5726
03:33:00,690 --> 03:33:02,430
There's no other place you can just reset your whole life

5727
03:33:02,430 --> 03:33:04,380
in the same country, it's wild.

5728
03:33:04,380 --> 03:33:05,790
You can reinvent yourself.

5729
03:33:05,790 --> 03:33:07,350
You can go broke, you can get rich,

5730
03:33:07,350 --> 03:33:09,840
you can go back and forth multiple times

5731
03:33:09,840 --> 03:33:11,160
and there's nobody there

5732
03:33:11,160 --> 03:33:13,230
and there's nowhere else where you have enough freedom

5733
03:33:13,230 --> 03:33:15,000
and opportunity to pursue that.

5734
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:16,860
I definitely have a lot of problems,

5735
03:33:16,860 --> 03:33:19,533
but I've traveled enough of the world now to know

5736
03:33:19,533 --> 03:33:22,920
that it's a special place and that gives me a lot of hope.

5737
03:33:22,920 --> 03:33:25,500
- I wish I could do a Bostonian accent

5738
03:33:25,500 --> 03:33:27,149
of we do these things.

5739
03:33:27,149 --> 03:33:27,982
- Yeah. - Not because they're easy,

5740
03:33:27,982 --> 03:33:28,815
but 'cause they're hard.

5741
03:33:28,815 --> 03:33:30,180
- Because they're hard. - Thank you.

5742
03:33:30,180 --> 03:33:32,550
- Yeah. (Lex laughs)

5743
03:33:32,550 --> 03:33:33,660
- That's so true.

5744
03:33:33,660 --> 03:33:36,240
The Scot-Irish guts. - Yeah.

5745
03:33:36,240 --> 03:33:39,240
- Well, listen, I'm a huge fan of yours, Saagar.

5746
03:33:39,240 --> 03:33:40,920
I hope to see you

5747
03:33:40,920 --> 03:33:43,740
in the White House interviewing the president.

5748
03:33:43,740 --> 03:33:44,573
- Yeah, there you go. That's right.

5749
03:33:44,573 --> 03:33:45,840
That's the only situation

5750
03:33:45,840 --> 03:33:46,920
you're gonna see me in the White House.

5751
03:33:46,920 --> 03:33:48,253
- Yeah. (chuckles) - Yeah.

5752
03:33:49,290 --> 03:33:53,412
- Front row and just talking free.

5753
03:33:53,412 --> 03:33:54,283
I would just,

5754
03:33:54,283 --> 03:33:58,080
I would love to live in a country and in a world

5755
03:33:58,080 --> 03:34:00,420
where it's you who gets to talk

5756
03:34:00,420 --> 03:34:03,363
to the press secretary, to the president,

5757
03:34:05,010 --> 03:34:06,534
'cause I think you're real,

5758
03:34:06,534 --> 03:34:09,060
you're one of the good ones as far as journalists goes,

5759
03:34:09,060 --> 03:34:09,930
as far as human beings.

5760
03:34:09,930 --> 03:34:11,577
So I hope to see you in there

5761
03:34:11,577 --> 03:34:15,260
and I hope you get to ask a question that-

5762
03:34:15,260 --> 03:34:16,650
- It ends up in a book.

5763
03:34:16,650 --> 03:34:18,210
- It ends up in a good history book.

5764
03:34:18,210 --> 03:34:19,770
- Absolutely, well, likewise,

5765
03:34:19,770 --> 03:34:21,300
I'm a huge fan of yours.

5766
03:34:21,300 --> 03:34:22,710
For anybody out there who's interested,

5767
03:34:22,710 --> 03:34:25,950
I compiled a list and I will go and retroactively edit it.

5768
03:34:25,950 --> 03:34:28,440
Just go to SaagarEnjeti.io.

5769
03:34:28,440 --> 03:34:31,230
I created a newsletter with a website that has all the links

5770
03:34:31,230 --> 03:34:32,580
to all the books I'm gonna talk about here.

5771
03:34:32,580 --> 03:34:35,067
- Beautiful, the hundreds of books that were mentioned here.

5772
03:34:35,067 --> 03:34:36,930
All right, brother, thank you so much for talking today.

5773
03:34:36,930 --> 03:34:38,490
- Thank you.

5774
03:34:38,490 --> 03:34:40,020
- Thanks for listening to this conversation

5775

5779
03:34:48,967 --> 03:34:52,827
"History is the study of the world's crime."

5780
