1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, What is the difference between a madman and a genius?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,800
Success.

3
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:15,673
The following is a conversation with Javier Milei, the president of Argentina.

4
00:00:16,323 --> 00:00:21,432
He is a libertarian, anarcho capitalist, and economist who

5
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:26,433
campaigned with a chainsaw, that symbolized his promise to slash the

6
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,162
corrupt bureaucracy of the state.

7
00:00:29,258 --> 00:00:33,197
He stepped into the presidency one year ago, with a country

8
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:37,127
on the brink of hyperinflation, deep in debt, and suffering from

9
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,017
mass unemployment and poverty.

10
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:45,248
He took this crisis head on, transforming one of Latin America's largest economies

11
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:47,888
through pure free market principles.

12
00:00:48,718 --> 00:00:53,377
In just a few months in office, he already achieved Argentina's first fiscal

13
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:59,593
surplus in 16 years, And not just avoided hyperinflation, but brought inflation

14
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,553
down to its lowest in three years.

15
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:06,503
We discuss all of this in detail, both the successes and the challenges.

16
00:01:07,258 --> 00:01:11,408
His depth of knowledge of economic principles, metrics, and data was

17
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:15,067
truly impressive, and refreshing to hear from a world leader.

18
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:19,807
But even bigger than the economic transformation of Argentina, Javier

19
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,518
represents the universal fight against government corruption

20
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,008
and the fight for freedom.

21
00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:29,043
Economic freedom, political freedom, and freedom of speech.

22
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:33,663
He has many critics, many of whom are part of the corrupt establishment

23
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,243
he's seeking to dismantle.

24
00:01:35,673 --> 00:01:41,153
But many are simply Argentinian citizens, scared of the pain his radical policies

25
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:43,522
may bring, at least in the short term.

26
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,993
But whether one disagrees with his methods or not, no one can deny, that his

27
00:01:48,993 --> 00:01:53,683
presidency marks one of the most ambitious attempts at economic transformation in

28
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:59,343
modern history and that Javier Milei is truly a force of nature, combining

29
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:03,452
the rigor of an economist with the passion of a revolutionary in the

30
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:06,723
fight for freedom of a nation he loves.

31
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,818
Argentina is one of my favorite countries.

32
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:12,598
So, I sincerely hope he succeeds.

33
00:02:13,538 --> 00:02:17,668
This interview was conducted with the president speaking Spanish and me

34
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:23,067
speaking English with an interpreter simultaneously translating, we make

35
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:27,568
the episode available, overdubbed and subtitled in both English and Spanish.

36
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:28,668
Thanks to our

37
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:30,967
great friends at ElevenLabs.

38
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,248
If you're watching on YouTube, you can switch between English and Spanish by

39
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,798
clicking the gear icon, selecting audio track, and then choosing the language.

40
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,558
Same with the captions.

41
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:45,078
If you're watching on X, I'll post both Spanish and English versions separately.

42
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,957
If you're watching on Spotify or listening elsewhere, I'll probably

43
00:02:48,957 --> 00:02:50,215
only post the English version.

44
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:55,448
This is the first time for me doing something like this, in a foreign language.

45
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:57,192
It was challenging, but illuminating.

46
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:02,173
I hope to continue talking to many world leaders for two to three hours in this

47
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:08,972
way, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, and Xi Jinping.

48
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:14,672
I want to explore who they are, how they think, and how they hope to help

49
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,702
their country and humanity flourish.

50
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:19,322
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

52
00:03:22,693 --> 00:03:26,092
And now, dear friends, here's Javier Milei

53
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:32,073
When did you first understand the value of freedom, especially economic freedom?

54
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:37,832
Well, actually, I came to understand the ideas of freedom

55
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:45,232
as an economic growth specialist back in the years of 2013 to 2014.

56
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:53,183
I could see that per capita GDP statistics over the last 2,000 years of the

57
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:59,312
Christian era, essentially looked like a hockey stick, indicating that per capita

58
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:06,912
GDP remained almost constant until around 1800, after which it accelerated sharply.

59
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:12,612
In the same context of that phenomenal increase in productivity and per capita

60
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:19,252
GDP, the population had multiplied sevenfold over the preceding 200 years.

61
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:26,373
So basically, in economics, that means you get increasing returns and the

62
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:32,772
presence of increasing returns implies the existence of monopolies, concentrated

63
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:38,123
structures, and according to traditional neoclassical economic theory, the

64
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:42,772
presence of monopolies and concentrated structures is not a good thing.

65
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:48,293
But at the same time, one could see that living standards had increased

66
00:04:48,303 --> 00:04:53,392
tremendously, and that middle income people ended up living far better

67
00:04:53,412 --> 00:04:59,017
than emperors did in the Roman era, and the population had gone

68
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:05,547
from having 95% of people in extreme poverty, to less than 10%.

69
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:10,787
And in that context, the question was how it could be that something that had

70
00:05:10,787 --> 00:05:15,397
lifted so many people out of poverty, that had improved human condition so

71
00:05:15,397 --> 00:05:20,357
much, could be something bad for economic theory, meaning something was not right.

72
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:27,348
So, in that context, I remember that one of the people who worked

73
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:32,957
on my team, suggested I read an article by Murray Newton Rothbard

74
00:05:32,998 --> 00:05:35,187
called 'Monopoly and Competition'

75
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,568
I remember reading it like it was today.

76
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:43,652
And after reading it carefully, I said, 'Everything I've taught about

77
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:49,003
market structure in the last 20 years in courses on microeconomics is wrong`.

78
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:56,592
This caused a very strong internal commotion in me, so I called this person,

79
00:05:56,592 --> 00:06:02,282
who used to work with me, and they recommended a place to buy Austrian School

80
00:06:02,282 --> 00:06:08,883
of Economics books, and I remember I bought at least 20 or 30 books, which I

81
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:11,943
went to pick up one Saturday afternoon.

82
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:16,763
And when I visited the bookstore, I was fascinated by

83
00:06:16,763 --> 00:06:18,423
all the stuff they had there.

84
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:22,883
So I went back the next day and I started calculating how much money

85
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,223
I needed to pay for my dog's food.

86
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,173
That's my four legged child.

87
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:32,383
And how much I needed to spend on the taxi fare and food.

88
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:38,163
And then, with what I have left, I spend all of it on more books.

89
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:43,088
And then I started to read very intensively and I remember,

90
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:49,308
for example, the experience of reading 'Human Action' by Mises.

91
00:06:49,637 --> 00:06:52,217
And this was a book that I didn't know about.

92
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:57,918
And I remember that on the following weekend, I started to read this

93
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,177
book right from the first page.

94
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,488
And I didn't stop until I finished it.

95
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:06,028
And that was a true revolution in my head.

96
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:14,178
And having the chance to read Austrian authors like Rothbard, Mises, Hayek,

97
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:21,947
Hoppe, and JesÃºs Huerta de Soto, or others like Juan Ramon Ralo, Philipp

98
00:07:21,977 --> 00:07:25,488
Bagus, and Walter Block, for example.

99
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:29,448
That was very inspirational.

100
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:35,417
And at one point, I got the opportunity to read related to the

101
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,958
works of Alberto Benegas Lynch Jr..

102
00:07:38,488 --> 00:07:41,588
And I also had the pleasure and honor to meet him.

103
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,718
And today, we are actually friends.

104
00:07:46,638 --> 00:07:50,587
So that paved the way for me to approach the ideas of freedom.

105
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:55,358
And another book that was a very significant influence and impact

106
00:07:55,358 --> 00:08:00,297
on me, was the 'Principles of Political Economics' by Menger.

107
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:02,928
It was truly eye opening.

108
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:10,818
Or let's say, for reading Eugen von BÃ¶hm-Bawerk these were things that really, that really

109
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:13,068
challenged all of my former thinking.

110
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:20,938
I had a vague idea and poor about the Austrian school.

111
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:26,738
The only thing I had read about the Austrian school until then had been 'Money

112
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:35,658
and Time', a very good book by Garrison, but, but now that I understand a little

113
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:38,138
bit more about Austrian economics.

114
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:41,388
I know that it was rather poor.

115
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:46,138
This doesn't mean that the book isn't good, but there were a

116
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:51,928
whole lot of things, to read, that ended up being truly fascinating.

117
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:59,197
So from that, what is now today, and maybe you can talk about the evolution, is your,

118
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:02,203
philosophy, economics philosophy.

119
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:07,413
You've described yourself as an anarcho capitalist, market anarchist, libertarian.

120
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:08,573
That's the ideal.

121
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:12,103
And then maybe in practice and reality, you've said that

122
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:13,473
you're more of a minarchist.

123
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:16,132
So lay it all out.

124
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:18,372
What's your economics philosophy today?

125
00:09:19,413 --> 00:09:22,413
Strictly speaking, I am an anarcho capitalist.

126
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:25,583
I despise the state, government.

127
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:26,993
I despise violence.

128
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:32,008
Let us suppose, we take the definition of liberalism.

129
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:35,918
I usually use the definition of liberalism given by Alberto Benegas

130
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:39,328
Lynch Jr., which is very much in line

131
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:46,303
with the definition of John Locke, which essentially matches the definition by

132
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:52,253
Alberto Benegas Lynch, Jr., who said that liberalism is the unrestricted

133
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:56,322
respect for the life project of, others based on the principle of

134
00:09:56,322 --> 00:10:01,032
non aggression and in defense of the right to life, liberty, and property.

135
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:08,083
So I frame all of the discussions within those term,  and the fact is that when you

136
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:13,683
get to that notion, I would dare say, that you become an anarcho capitalist de facto.

137
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:19,883
And what that describes, it is an idea, which represents my ideal world.

138
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:22,442
I mean, that is the ideal world.

139
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,812
Now, real life poses a whole lot of restraints.

140
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:31,668
And some of those you can lift, and those restrictions and others you can't.

141
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,697
So, in real life I am a minarchist.

142
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,457
I advocate for minimizing state size.

143
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:43,393
I tried to remove as many regulations as possible.

144
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:47,062
In fact, that is what I used to say during my campaign.

145
00:10:47,323 --> 00:10:49,273
And let's say that is what I'm now carrying out.

146
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:54,023
We have just carried out the largest structural reform in Argentine history.

147
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:58,302
It is a structural reform, that is eight times larger than Menem's, which had been

148
00:10:58,302 --> 00:11:00,513
the largest structural reform in history.

149
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:04,613
And we did that with 15 % of the representatives and

150
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,073
10 % of the senators.

151
00:11:06,783 --> 00:11:10,023
Furthermore, we have a deregulation ministry, where

152
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:14,633
basically every day we eliminate between one and five regulations.

153
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:20,322
On the other hand, we have 3,200 additional structural reforms pending to

154
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:25,622
the point that, the day we finish all these reforms, we will be the freest country

155
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:30,203
on the planet, with the consequences they have in terms of wellbeing.

156
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:31,703
Think about this.

157
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:36,433
When Ireland started market reforms just over 40 years ago, it was

158
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,093
the poorest country in Europe.

159
00:11:38,503 --> 00:11:43,983
Today, its GDP per capita is 50 % higher than that of the United States.

160
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:52,223
So this, I have a current situation and what I am constantly

161
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:57,022
looking for, whether from my academic works and my outreach notes and

162
00:11:57,032 --> 00:12:00,023
books, is the world we have today.

163
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:07,413
That every day we are closer, that every day we gain more freedom, because

164
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:08,552
null

165
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:10,253
Interesting things here.

166
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:14,533
First, I would like to quote Milton Friedman.

167
00:12:15,453 --> 00:12:19,273
There is a moment when they do an interview with Milton Friedman,

168
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,232
and they ask him about liberals.

169
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:24,723
And then he says that there are three types of liberals.

170
00:12:25,182 --> 00:12:29,098
There are the classical liberals, where, for example, Adam Smith or

171
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:31,228
Milton Friedman himself could fit.

172
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:34,578
Some say that Hayek could fit into that category.

173
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,278
For me, Hayek is a minarchist.

174
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,598
Then you have the minarchists, where you could clearly find

175
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:45,058
in that place Mises, Hayek.

176
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:49,268
One could find in philosophical terms Nozick.

177
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:56,803
And basically, Ayn Rand, and at one point, Milton Friedman, based on his own

178
00:12:56,803 --> 00:13:01,893
son, he says, but if you look closely, there are some who are anarchists.

179
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:07,832
Let's say, probably from my point of view, the person, who has been the

180
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:13,713
greatest inspiration in my life is essentially Murray Newton Rothbard.

181
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:19,813
So therefore, there, uh, there are two dimensions.

182
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:21,593
One is where I want to go.

183
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,558
And the topic is where I stand.

184
00:13:24,788 --> 00:13:29,038
So the most important thing is to try each day to advance further toward

185
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:31,617
that ideal of anarcho capitalism.

186
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:40,197
In that sense, sometimes we face strong and harsh criticism

187
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:42,227
regarding that ideal vision.

188
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:44,858
I think that's the Nirvana fallacy.

189
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:49,388
If you compare yourself against paradise, everything is horrible

190
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:53,863
and miserable, but you don't live in paradise, you live on earth.

191
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:59,693
Basically, what you need to understand is something called the state conditions.

192
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:04,172
Let's suppose, uh, that you don't like rectangular tables,

193
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,672
you prefer circular tables.

194
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:11,932
Now, the reality is, I have only a few hours.

195
00:14:12,903 --> 00:14:17,823
until I go and catch my flight and the table is rectangular.

196
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:22,323
You like a circular table, a round one, but there isn't one.

197
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:26,352
What you have is a rectangular table.

198
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:30,352
So either we do the interview here or we just can't do it.

199
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:31,513
So what do you do?

200
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,832
You adapt to the current conditions.

201
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:34,913
This is what there is.

202
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:35,633
Now

203
00:14:36,338 --> 00:14:41,328
So then you have some restrictions, that you can change and others that you cannot.

204
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:46,158
The idea is to modify all the ones that can be changed in the short term

205
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:51,628
and start working on those that can be modified in the medium or long term.

206
00:14:52,427 --> 00:14:57,778
For example, for example, if you really like round tables, perhaps the

207
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,457
next interview we may do at a round table, we're going to try and solve it.

208
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:04,457
But today it's something that we couldn't possibly solve.

209
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:08,758
So, that's basically the idea, right?

210
00:15:09,128 --> 00:15:13,388
Let's say it's about understanding that some restrictions you can't

211
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:18,318
change, others you can, and there are institutional restrictions too.

212
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:24,538
There are many anarcho capitalists, who are dedicated to criticizing,

213
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:28,978
and incredibly they do so with more violence towards liberals.

214
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:36,553
And many of them actually criticize me, which truly makes no sense because

215
00:15:36,573 --> 00:15:40,123
it is precisely the Nirvana fallacy.

216
00:15:43,463 --> 00:15:52,083
The reality is that, in Argentina, for example, the most popular sport is soccer.

217
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,582
When you go to watch an Argentina match, it is beautiful.

218
00:15:57,543 --> 00:16:02,043
The stands are full and they're all painted with sky blue and white colors.

219
00:16:03,383 --> 00:16:04,713
There is a lot of joy.

220
00:16:04,753 --> 00:16:08,642
People sing songs that are very fun, that are very distinctive.

221
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:14,058
Very, it's very much part of Argentine folklore, so to speak.

222
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:20,098
You see, that beautiful show is external.

223
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,318
That is to say, it does not determine the outcome.

224
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:26,357
You place the ball in the middle of the field, and no matter how much

225
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:28,007
people shout, the ball doesn't move.

226
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:31,248
The one who moves the ball and scores the goals is Messi.

227
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,878
So what do I mean?

228
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:39,428
If you don't get involved and don't get into it, no, you don't do anything.

229
00:16:39,827 --> 00:16:46,068
So, I mean, what do I know is that there are many liberals, libertarians,

230
00:16:46,068 --> 00:16:51,047
and anarcho capitalists who are really useless, because all they do is criticize.

231
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,123
Let's say those of us who want to lead the world toward the ideas of

232
00:16:55,133 --> 00:17:00,513
freedom and what they don't realize is that power is a zero sum game.

233
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:04,073
And if we don't have it, then the left will have it.

234
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:09,781
Therefore, if you level your harshest criticism at those in

235
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:15,202
your own ranks, you end up being subservient to socialism, probably.

236
00:17:16,262 --> 00:17:23,772
And also, for instance, you have cases of strong hypocrisy, let's say.

237
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,442
I have seen cases of agorists.

238
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:33,502
I mean, it's the anarcho capitalists who criticize Rothbard because he said

239
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:38,332
that you have to get into politics, otherwise the socialists will advance?

240
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:44,118
And it's interesting because some of them, I have seen them

241
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:47,257
criticizing, proposing egorism.

242
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:55,368
And I remember one of them, one day, the police showed up, and

243
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:57,127
honestly, he was peeing himself.

244
00:17:57,718 --> 00:18:02,457
So, I mean, it's very easy to criticize, propose, and suggest.

245
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:06,598
But if he was truly such an agonist, he should have been

246
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:08,428
willing to endure going to jail.

247
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:13,058
However, when it was time to face the consequences of the idea he was

248
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:18,958
promoting, he froze, wet his pants, and ended up, let's say, accepting all the

249
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:24,088
restrictions because, clearly, it was better to be out of jail than in jail.

250
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:28,978
But in doing so, he sold out his ideas.

251
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:35,338
So it seems to me that no, not taking into account the restrictions

252
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:42,913
of the situation only serves to be functional to socialism, because all

253
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,143
it does is strike against one's own.

254
00:18:45,883 --> 00:18:48,483
So you became president 11 months ago.

255
00:18:48,853 --> 00:18:52,913
Can you again describe some of the actions you took?

256
00:18:53,292 --> 00:18:56,363
For example, you cut half the number of government ministries,

257
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,522
layoffs, removed price controls.

258
00:18:59,542 --> 00:19:00,722
It would be interesting to lay out.

259
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:02,498
The first steps.

260
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:03,888
And what's next?

261
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:09,188
If you allow me, I will first give you a description of the situation we received.

262
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:13,468
And based on that, I will tell you each of the things we did.

263
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:23,488
When, we first took office, basically what we found was that in the

264
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:29,458
first week of December, inflation was rising at a rate of 1 % per day,

265
00:19:29,988 --> 00:19:34,137
which means 3,700 % annually.

266
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:42,108
In the first half of December, it had accelerated to 7,500 % annually.

267
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,377
When you look at wholesale inflation in December of last year, it

268
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:52,747
was 54%, which, if annualized, would equate to an inflation

269
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:55,397
rate of 17,000 % per year.

270
00:19:57,257 --> 00:20:02,198
And, in addition, Argentina, for the previous 10 years, had not

271
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:07,648
been growing, with a drop in GDP per capita of approximately 15%.

272
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:15,673
And the reality was that nearly 50 % were living in poverty.

273
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:20,473
Now, later, I will get deeper into that discussion.

274
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:27,752
And the reality is that we had a fiscal deficit, which amounted to 15 % of

275
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:33,803
GDP, 5 points were in the treasury, 10 points were in the central bank,

276
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:37,013
which was endogenous monetary issuance.

277
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:43,257
And the reality is that we also had interest bearing liabilities at

278
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:49,588
the central bank equivalent to four monetary bases, maturing in one day,

279
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:53,827
meaning we could have quintupled the amount of money in one day.

280
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:58,237
We had peso denominated maturities amounting to the

281
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:00,627
equivalent of 90 billion dollars.

282
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:05,368
The central bank had negative net currency foreign reserves,

283
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:07,777
minus 12 billion dollars.

284
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:14,063
We had commercial debts in the central bank equivalent to 50 billion dollars.

285
00:21:14,593 --> 00:21:18,983
There were company dividends held back amounting to 10 billion dollars.

286
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:26,193
Therefore, if we, if we had instantly opened up, you see, I

287
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,383
say we are liberal libertarians.

288
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:30,223
We are not liberal fools.

289
00:21:31,452 --> 00:21:37,222
That's what some anarchist liberals suggested, meaning that we basically

290
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:39,352
open everything on the first day.

291
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:43,017
So in that, in that context, of course.

292
00:21:44,078 --> 00:21:47,807
If we had done that, we would have encountered hyperinflation.

293
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:53,247
Therefore, that would have led to the number of poor people being around

294
00:21:53,258 --> 00:22:00,918
95%, and probably, and by December, the Peronist party would have

295
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:05,458
organized supermarkets lootings and would have done all sorts of things

296
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,928
and would have probably been ousted.

297
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:12,778
And by the first part of the year, the Peronists would have gone back to office.

298
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:18,097
So to us, it was crucial to end fiscal deficit.

299
00:22:19,267 --> 00:22:23,788
One of the things we promised during the campaign had been to

300
00:22:23,788 --> 00:22:25,758
reduce the number of ministries.

301
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:32,017
And indeed we reduced to less than half the number of ministries

302
00:22:32,028 --> 00:22:33,528
because we went to nine ministries.

303
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:34,427
Today we have eight.

304
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:39,408
We have also laid off a large number of civil employees.

305
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:43,907
Today I can say that we've already dismissed about 50,000 of them.

306
00:22:45,198 --> 00:22:49,847
And we, we practically don't renew any contracts unless the

307
00:22:49,858 --> 00:22:54,097
positions are absolutely necessary.

308
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:59,803
At the same time, we have stopped public works and we have eliminated

309
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:02,603
discretionary transfers to the provinces.

310
00:23:04,263 --> 00:23:07,533
We have also diluted public sector wages.

311
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:14,302
Also, we have eliminated economic subsidies by restoring utility

312
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:15,713
rates to the right levels.

313
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:23,703
And well, uh, well, and in that, let's say in this context, we

314
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:27,293
achieved fiscal balance as far as the treasury is concerned.

315
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:33,453
This is very important because in the last 123 years, Argentina

316
00:23:33,473 --> 00:23:35,773
had a deficit for 113 of them.

317
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:38,913
And in the 10 years, it did not have a deficit because

318
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:40,303
it was not paying the debt.

319
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,903
So that was absolutely false.

320
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:47,313
And they told us it would be impossible to do that.

321
00:23:47,773 --> 00:23:49,732
We had planned to do so within a year.

322
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:54,747
And they said it wasn't possible to adjust by more than 1 %-point.

323
00:23:56,007 --> 00:24:00,938
And we achieved fiscal balance in the month of January.

324
00:24:00,938 --> 00:24:03,048
That is the first month of administration.

325
00:24:04,057 --> 00:24:09,488
At the same time, we also cut social plans linked to intermediation.

326
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:14,658
This is very important because we knew we were going to make a very tough

327
00:24:14,658 --> 00:24:22,128
adjustment, and we knew that this was going to have a cost in social terms.

328
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:28,502
And we knew that we had to offer support during the first month, I mean the first

329
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:30,702
quarter and second quarter in office.

330
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,862
One of the things we did was to eliminate what are known as poverty

331
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:38,382
managers, that is intermediaries.

332
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:45,663
Basically, people have a guard through which they receive assistance, but it

333
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:51,413
happens that they had to provide a counter service and that counter service was

334
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,953
verified by a group called the Picateros.

335
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:59,523
So in that context, when they were going to sign, the counter service

336
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:01,292
took away half of the money.

337
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:05,823
So by removing that payoff, they stopped extorting them,

338
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,773
stopped stealing their money.

339
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:12,173
And with the same amount of money, they received double the resources.

340
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:16,378
And of course, we also provided an additional boost.

341
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:23,228
So let's say that this is related to the five adjustment points in the treasury.

342
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,218
Now what happens?

343
00:25:25,888 --> 00:25:30,798
As we began to achieve fiscal balance and no longer needed to issue money to finance

344
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:36,238
ourselves, and as we also met interest payments and some capital repayments,

345
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:42,617
one of the things that happened is that the debt market began to be recreated.

346
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:46,383
So, we were able to take debt out of the central bank and

347
00:25:46,383 --> 00:25:49,583
transfer it to the treasury, where it should have always been.

348
00:25:50,323 --> 00:25:54,682
And that meant an adjustment of approximately 10 % of GDP.

349
00:25:55,072 --> 00:25:58,682
Everyone said this would be impossible and couldn't be fixed.

350
00:25:58,813 --> 00:26:03,053
Essentially, what we did was implement a fiscal adjustment at the central

351
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:05,503
bank amounting to 10 % of GDP.

352
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:11,818
So, if you ask me, it's clear that we have not only made the biggest fiscal

353
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:15,708
adjustment in the history of humanity, because we made a fiscal adjustment of

354
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:23,333
15 points of the GDP, but also, most of that went back to the people, as less

355
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:26,392
seigniorage, as a lower inflation rate.

356
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:30,153
It's true, that we temporarily raised the country tax, but

357
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,773
we lowered it in September.

358
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,713
And now in December, we're going to eliminate it.

359
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:38,212
Today, for example, we also announced that in December, we

360
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:39,872
are eliminating import taxes.

361
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:47,533
In fact, in that, in that regard, what you have is that we return to the people

362
00:26:47,543 --> 00:26:53,453
13 and a half points of GDP because the real tax burden is the size of the state.

363
00:26:54,112 --> 00:27:00,872
So, while back in December we were discussing hyperinflation, today

364
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:03,172
we are discussing 30 year loans.

365
00:27:03,483 --> 00:27:07,062
In other words, all those resources that the national government used to

366
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:09,783
take are now back in the private sector.

367
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:13,073
And that's what has allowed it to be very dynamic.

368
00:27:13,662 --> 00:27:16,422
And this has two very strong impacts.

369
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,253
The first one is that if you look at wholesale inflation,

370
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:26,272
it went down from 54% to 2%, so it went down by 27 times.

371
00:27:26,902 --> 00:27:29,092
It was divided into 27.

372
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:34,443
So we had inflation at a rate of 17,000% annually, and it's now

373
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:36,883
close to about 28 % a year.

374
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:39,383
But it's not only that.

375
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:42,783
You could consider consumer inflation.

376
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:46,003
The latest consumer inflation rate was 2.7%.

377
00:27:47,673 --> 00:27:52,983
Now, it happens that we, essentially due to a matter that is related to

378
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:58,703
the central bank's balance sheets and also due to the debt stocks, we still

379
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:02,703
have controls in place and we are eliminating restrictions day by day.

380
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:10,123
Now, the interesting thing is that we have a 2 % monthly devaluation standard

381
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:16,313
and there's international inflation, of course, which means that you then have

382
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:20,223
to subtract two and a half points from the inflation observed by the consumer.

383
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:25,553
This indicates that inflation in Argentina, the true inflation, not the induced one,

384
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:30,063
but the actual monetary inflation is 0.2% per month At 0.2 % per month.

385
00:28:30,993 --> 00:28:33,983
0.2 % per month, this equates to 2.4% annually.

386
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,752
What I'm saying is, the original discussion was about whether

387
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:42,592
inflation could reach 17,000%.

388
00:28:43,773 --> 00:28:47,243
Now we are bringing inflation down to levels of 2.5%

389
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:51,173
annually, and that is amazing.

390
00:28:51,493 --> 00:28:54,662
And we achieve this by considering a number of factors.

391
00:28:55,693 --> 00:29:01,263
The third one is that we did not experience a previous hyperinflation,

392
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:06,083
which would have simplified the process of implementing a stabilization program.

393
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:12,022
Typically, when hyperinflation occurs, monetary assets are diluted, leading

394
00:29:12,022 --> 00:29:14,402
to a natural restoration of demand.

395
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:18,818
And besides, we did not resort to any expropriation.

396
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:22,508
For example, before the Convertibility Plan, which was the most

397
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:25,788
successful program in Argentina's history, Argentina experienced

398
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,618
two instances of hyperinflation.

399
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:31,607
During AlfonsÃ­n's administration, inflation reached 5,000%, and

400
00:29:31,607 --> 00:29:33,878
under Menem, it was 1,200%.

401
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:37,818
Additionally, there was the Bonex Plan, under which debt was

402
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,858
exchanged on a compulsory basis.

403
00:29:40,198 --> 00:29:44,668
In other words, what we did instead was clean up the central bank balance sheet.

404
00:29:46,007 --> 00:29:50,958
So with that, we, we cleaned up the central bank's balance sheet.

405
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:55,788
We cleared a loss of 45 billion dollars all voluntarily.

406
00:29:56,448 --> 00:30:00,057
And the most amazing thing is that we did it in just six months.

407
00:30:00,768 --> 00:30:04,707
And at the same time, we have not controlled prices, nor have

408
00:30:04,707 --> 00:30:06,308
we fixed the exchange rate.

409
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:08,298
And this is very important.

410
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:12,748
All previous stabilization programs, in an effort to show

411
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:15,328
quick results, used to do this.

412
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:20,617
What they would do is, before announcing the plan, they would adjust

413
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:24,468
the rates, and once the rates were adjusted, they would launch the plan.

414
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:28,717
But in our case, we couldn't afford that luxury, so we had

415
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,508
to implement it on the go.

416
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:37,593
And also, over the past few months, that is to say, companies brought in rates

417
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:44,333
that covered only about 10%, whereas today they cover 80%, so you get the picture.

418
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:47,113
Just imagine the adjustment we are making.

419
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:52,652
And in that sense, it is also incredible what we have achieved, because if we were

420
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:57,798
to work with the inflation we have in our country today, considering the exchange

421
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:02,448
rate situation, the figures are even better than during the Convertibility

422
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:08,648
Program, which was the most successful economic program in Argentina's history.

423
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:14,177
And in fact, there is an article called 'Passing the Buck', which is by Gerardo

424
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:20,288
della Paolera Bozzoli and Irigoyen, that demonstrates that Menem's first government

425
00:31:20,298 --> 00:31:22,858
was the best government in history.

426
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,548
And basically, it argues two things.

427
00:31:26,113 --> 00:31:30,773
In the success of the stabilization of the Convertibility Program.

428
00:31:31,093 --> 00:31:37,433
So if you take a closer look, when you examine it carefully, when you account

429
00:31:37,443 --> 00:31:41,973
for all these factors, our disinflation process is actually much more genuine.

430
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:44,103
And not only that, it's also much deeper.

431
00:31:44,933 --> 00:31:52,157
We restored freedoms to Argentinians, while simultaneously implementing a

432
00:31:52,157 --> 00:31:52,936
structural reform eight times larger.

433
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:59,353
And we accomplished this with only, with 15 % of the representatives,

434
00:31:59,393 --> 00:32:03,572
10 % of the senators, and within the first six months of government.

435
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:09,003
In other words, our deregulation agenda continues daily and we still have

436
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:12,363
3,200 structural reforms pending.

437
00:32:12,843 --> 00:32:16,683
This will ultimately make Argentina the freest country in the world.

438
00:32:18,823 --> 00:32:23,698
Moreover, to have a sense of magnitude, The reforms that we already have made

439
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:29,468
with the Executive Order 7023 and with the Basis Law, we have actually jumped

440
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:31,788
90 places in terms of economic freedom.

441
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:36,967
What this means is that today, Argentina has institutions similar to those of

442
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:42,843
Germany, France, and Italy, and we obviously want this to continue and

443
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:47,243
let's say we are going to surpass no doubt the levels of economic freedom

444
00:32:47,243 --> 00:32:49,063
that Ireland reached in its best moment.

445
00:32:49,462 --> 00:32:53,332
And not only that, we're going to exceed the levels of economic freedom of

446
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,633
Australia, New Zealand, and Switzerland.

447
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:59,083
We are undoubtedly going to be the freest country in the world.

448
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:04,863
And this, and this means that thanks to what we've done today.

449
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:10,512
We are on a path that allows us to multiply our per capita GDP by

450
00:33:10,513 --> 00:33:14,263
2.5 times when you apply the relevant correction.

451
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:19,863
And this, of course, is something very interesting because it implies

452
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:21,863
a huge increase in well being.

453
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:26,233
And furthermore, today the Argentinian economy is already

454
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,353
strongly and amazingly recovering.

455
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:33,773
And we can say, analysts hypotheses were suggesting that next year we would

456
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:36,033
be growing between 5 and 6 %.

457
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:41,643
Today, JP Morgan has now corrected, or let's say revised,

458
00:33:41,653 --> 00:33:42,903
the projections upwards.

459
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:47,668
And besides, when we normalize the price situation, the true poverty rate came

460
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:50,318
up and it was 57 % in January.

461
00:33:50,658 --> 00:33:56,388
Today it is at 46%, meaning we lowered poverty by 11 percentage points.

462
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:00,368
Let's say, I mean, it seems truly like a miracle.

463
00:34:00,918 --> 00:34:04,578
And not only that, but actually not a single job was lost in the process.

464
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:08,027
When it comes to all of this inflation reduction process,

465
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:11,447
people said that our economy and economic activity would collapse.

466
00:34:12,453 --> 00:34:18,723
And actually, when you look at the deseasonalized data, you see that in August,

467
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:23,983
there was a recovery that took us back to December levels, to December levels.

468
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:28,262
That means that in the year, we made the largest fiscal adjustment

469
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:29,873
in the history of humanity.

470
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:34,293
We will end up with less inflation, fewer poor people, better real

471
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:39,003
wages, and additionally, a GDP higher than what we started with.

472
00:34:39,822 --> 00:34:43,893
And if you look at it in dollars, I can assure you that

473
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:45,632
the numbers are phenomenal.

474
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:50,123
Because basically, today the dollar is below the levels

475
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:51,893
we had when we took office.

476
00:34:52,938 --> 00:34:57,848
So the reality is that and all of this when you take my popularity levels

477
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:02,538
and the government's acceptance levels today, they are above the moment

478
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:08,118
we assumed office if you know that the moment of maximum popularity is when

479
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:15,403
you take office therefore this means that far from resting on our laurels

480
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:17,573
with this, we're going for more reforms.

481
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,483
We're going to deepen the reforms.

482
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:22,862
And I tell you, we won't stop until Argentina is the

483
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:25,033
freest country in the world.

484
00:35:26,593 --> 00:35:30,503
Furthermore, a recent work by an Argentinian economist named

485
00:35:30,533 --> 00:35:35,023
Juan Pablo Nicolini was presented at the central bank's monetary meetings.

486
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:40,703
And he works at the Federal Reserve, and it's interesting because he shows

487
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:45,152
that only on the basis of what we have done in fiscal matters, it ensures

488
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:51,002
that in the span of 10 years, we can double the GDP per capita, meaning

489
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:57,343
that Argentina could grow at rates of 7 % annually, which is thanks.

490
00:35:58,043 --> 00:36:03,133
Very much, very much, and that has strong consequences in terms of

491
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:08,003
improving quality of life, reducing poverty, reducing indigence.

492
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:15,112
Therefore, if during the worst moment our image didn't suffer and we stayed strong

493
00:36:15,123 --> 00:36:21,293
in our ideas, now that everything is working much better, why should we change?

494
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,813
On the contrary, we are ready to redouble the bet.

495
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:31,133
To redouble our efforts because we've done things that no one else has done.

496
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:33,313
I will give you an example.

497
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,652
There's something that seems trivial, but there's what's

498
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,843
called the single paper ballot.

499
00:36:39,682 --> 00:36:45,908
Argentina used to vote with huge ballots, which were very above all,

500
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:52,948
very costly, and that reform, it never, let's say it wasn't done because

501
00:36:52,968 --> 00:36:55,018
it always harmed the ruling party.

502
00:36:55,508 --> 00:36:59,597
So everyone talked about going to the single paper ballot, but no

503
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,377
one did it when they were in power.

504
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:05,257
They didn't want to implement it because they preferred to commit

505
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:08,877
fraud or use some kind of trickery.

506
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:14,128
To avoid applying that rule that makes the election more competitive.

507
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:17,948
Well, what's interesting, we sent that law and it was approved.

508
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:23,028
What's more, now we are finishing with the open, simultaneous and mandatory

509
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:28,118
primaries because it was a mechanism by which politics was also stealing.

510
00:37:28,717 --> 00:37:32,188
We are eliminating the financing of political parties.

511
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:38,618
If you look, we have reduced the fiscal pressure by 15 points to the Argentinians.

512
00:37:39,238 --> 00:37:45,098
We are restoring freedoms with a deep set of structural and regulatory reforms.

513
00:37:46,078 --> 00:37:52,438
That is, I think that any sensible liberal

514
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:58,323
could perceive, we are already delivering a wonderful government.

515
00:37:58,683 --> 00:38:01,393
In fact, it's the best government in the history of Argentina.

516
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:04,863
If the best had been that of Menem, we've already outpaced him.

517
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:10,803
Maybe you can explain to me the metrics of poverty and unemployment.

518
00:38:10,813 --> 00:38:14,082
As you said, unemployment went down, real unemployment went

519
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:16,062
down, real poverty went down.

520
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:20,602
But even that aside, what have been the most painful

521
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:26,858
impacts of these radical reforms and how many of them are required

522
00:38:26,868 --> 00:38:30,648
in the short term to have a big positive impact in the long term?

523
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:33,108
Let's take it step by step.

524
00:38:33,108 --> 00:38:33,608
Alright?

525
00:38:33,858 --> 00:38:39,088
That is we, in fact, we started to do things right.

526
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:41,187
Therefore we did not create poverty.

527
00:38:41,518 --> 00:38:44,188
The poverty was an inherited poverty.

528
00:38:45,718 --> 00:38:48,518
The point is that what we did was to reveal it.

529
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:53,733
I'll try to explain it with an example that I think clarifies

530
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:55,583
what's happening in Argentina.

531
00:38:57,023 --> 00:39:02,568
Argentina was an economy that had total price controls.

532
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,538
It had a fiscal deficit, which was financed through money printing.

533
00:39:08,778 --> 00:39:11,058
Just for you to give you an idea.

534
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:16,447
In the last year, Argentina financed 13 points of the gross domestic

535
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,247
product with money printing.

536
00:39:19,118 --> 00:39:20,937
In other words, a real disaster.

537
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:26,078
So, that situation provoke this artificially demand

538
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,258
and puts pressure on prices.

539
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:33,877
The issue is that price controls are applied additionally over the prices

540
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:40,827
that they enter the price index with which inflation was, I'm not saying they

541
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:42,778
were lying about it, it was distorted.

542
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:49,108
And, since Argentina measures poverty and indigence by income line, then.

543
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:51,393
What happens?

544
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:58,203
That distorted the true levels of poverty, of course, but that's not the only effect.

545
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:02,672
I mean, let's say the real poverty levels were higher, quite a bit higher than

546
00:40:02,672 --> 00:40:06,913
those shown by the previous government, which showed them at 41 % and

547
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:09,292
also did so on a six monthly basis.

548
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:15,323
So if you, let's say, have a growing trend, they are actually leaving you

549
00:40:15,323 --> 00:40:19,993
a bomb and you don't see it because, let's say, basically the indicator was

550
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:26,433
measured with a delayed form, but not only that, imagine that you are also

551
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:35,592
given, you are in the middle of an island, alone, and they give you one million

552
00:40:35,593 --> 00:40:36,953
dollars, what can you do with that?

553
00:40:38,923 --> 00:40:41,723
You cannot do anything because you cannot buy anything.

554
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:49,742
It's the same as if someone tells you that the price of glasses is 10, but when

555
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:52,563
you want to buy it, it's not available.

556
00:40:53,062 --> 00:40:57,033
Actually, there's a joke told by an Argentinian professor named

557
00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:02,683
Juan Carlos de Pablo, who says that a man goes to a bazaar and asks for a vase.

558
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:05,933
Then he says to him, well, I want that vase.

559
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,323
How much would you charge me?

560
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:10,422
Then he says 5,000 dollars

561
00:41:10,703 --> 00:41:15,103
Oh, okay 5,000 but why 5,000 if across the street?

562
00:41:15,103 --> 00:41:19,342
It's 1,000 he says well go buy it across the street for a thousand.

563
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:23,232
Ah, there's none for a thousand Well, then here when there's more it'll also

564
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:28,613
cost a thousand in other words prices at which they are available. So what happens

565
00:41:28,813 --> 00:41:34,583
when you are faced with that situation the supermarket shelves were empty so

566
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:38,468
What was the point of having a price at which you couldn't buy anything?

567
00:41:38,918 --> 00:41:41,008
You left those prices, the shelves were empty.

568
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:45,358
So the statistics show that you are much better, but the reality

569
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:46,538
is you couldn't buy anything.

570
00:41:47,073 --> 00:41:48,113
You couldn't make it happen.

571
00:41:48,563 --> 00:41:53,173
So if you left the situation as it was, people were going to starve

572
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:54,603
because they couldn't buy anything.

573
00:41:55,553 --> 00:41:58,813
Yes, they had a certain amount of money that could supposedly buy certain goods,

574
00:41:59,153 --> 00:42:01,233
but those goods were not available.

575
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:04,923
What the, what is the only thing you can do to save people?

576
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:08,908
Make the prices transparent and allow products to reappear.

577
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:12,188
Well, when you make the prices transparent, you also make transparent

578
00:42:12,198 --> 00:42:16,738
the cost of the basic food basket and the total basic basket, meaning the

579
00:42:16,738 --> 00:42:21,008
poverty line, sorry, the indigence line and the poverty line respectively.

580
00:42:21,298 --> 00:42:24,677
And when you do that, clearly, you will see a jump in poverty.

581
00:42:24,898 --> 00:42:27,678
That brought poverty up to 57%.

582
00:42:28,503 --> 00:42:32,453
Now, Argentina found its activity floor in the month of April.

583
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:38,133
From that moment, Argentina began to invent a cyclical recovery.

584
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:42,432
Real wages have been growing every month above inflation.

585
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:45,712
Therefore, nominal wages are beating inflation.

586
00:42:46,183 --> 00:42:50,423
In fact, we are already at levels similar to those we had in November.

587
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:52,593
The same goes for pensions.

588
00:42:53,013 --> 00:42:57,993
Moreover, Also, let's say there is a rebound in activity due to

589
00:42:57,993 --> 00:42:59,753
the recovery of the stock cycle.

590
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:03,883
Therefore, this is also contributing to more and better paid jobs.

591
00:43:04,073 --> 00:43:07,753
In fact, this is so strong and evident that the wages growing the

592
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:09,902
most are in the informal sector.

593
00:43:10,443 --> 00:43:14,073
This means that poverty and extreme poverty are decreasing

594
00:43:14,073 --> 00:43:15,813
much faster than we imagined.

595
00:43:16,213 --> 00:43:19,443
But not only that, by eliminating inflation, you

596
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:21,113
remove the inflationary tax.

597
00:43:21,698 --> 00:43:26,448
But the real burden is the fiscal deficit, which was 15 points of the GDP.

598
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:31,008
Okay, we temporarily raised the country tax, now we lower it, but

599
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,358
we return that to the Argentinians.

600
00:43:33,708 --> 00:43:36,558
We gave back 15 points of the GDP.

601
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:41,753
Not only that, but also when you eliminate inflation, you remove

602
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:43,763
the distortion of relative prices.

603
00:43:44,093 --> 00:43:47,003
Therefore, the allocation of resources is much better.

604
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:51,653
Not only that, but also with the strong fiscal adjustment we made,

605
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:57,053
we have reduced the country risk from 3,000 basis points to 770.

606
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,603
Today, Fitch raised Argentina's rating to triple C.

607
00:44:01,323 --> 00:44:03,893
So, what do I mean?

608
00:44:04,213 --> 00:44:08,613
That translates into a lower country risk and interest rates, and that

609
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:12,913
generates an increase in investment, also generates an increase in consumption.

610
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:17,023
In other words, the Argentinian economy is currently in an

611
00:44:17,033 --> 00:44:19,143
absolutely flourishing moment.

612
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:21,413
And how is that sustained in the long term?

613
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:25,943
With structural reforms, which we implement daily, deregulating the economy

614
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:30,013
and introducing new laws that free Argentinians from the burden of poverty.

615
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:35,923
From the many oppressive measures that have burdened it over the past 100 years.

616
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:41,123
You've spoken about the caste, the corrupt political establishment.

617
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:47,403
So there's a lot of powerful people and groups that are against your ideas.

618
00:44:47,683 --> 00:44:52,183
What does it take to fight when so much power is against you?

619
00:44:54,113 --> 00:44:58,643
Look, we have fought against corruption like never before in Argentina.

620
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:06,433
In fact, when we took office, for example, there were about 900 roadblocks per year.

621
00:45:07,093 --> 00:45:10,573
That is, people who made a habit of blocking the streets.

622
00:45:11,182 --> 00:45:13,033
They prevented free movement.

623
00:45:14,152 --> 00:45:16,373
And besides, they were given social plans.

624
00:45:17,153 --> 00:45:18,703
And they were given a lot of money.

625
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:23,703
If you remember, when I started by explaining the cuts, one of the

626
00:45:23,713 --> 00:45:28,263
things I said was that we removed the middlemen of poverty, in other words,

627
00:45:28,263 --> 00:45:33,513
the managers of poverty, those who lived by stealing from the poor, well,

628
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,943
that is a huge source of corruption.

629
00:45:35,943 --> 00:45:37,582
In fact, when we did that,

630
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:45,118
two days later, One of the most renowned and influential piqueteros

631
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:48,058
called for a demonstration.

632
00:45:48,198 --> 00:45:52,588
He claimed that 50,000 people would attend because he was

633
00:45:52,588 --> 00:45:55,557
actually expecting 100,000.

634
00:45:55,638 --> 00:45:59,087
So he wanted to showcase it as a success.

635
00:46:00,003 --> 00:46:04,603
And so then let's say with the decision made in Human Capital to

636
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:09,543
cut their funding, the anti blockade protocol was also enacted, where

637
00:46:09,543 --> 00:46:13,703
those who block the streets wouldn't receive welfare benefits, and those

638
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:15,922
who broke the law would go to jail.

639
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:17,712
All of that.

640
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:24,629
And also, we were informing this through transportation channels.

641
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:31,323
Well, in that march, they expected to have 100,000 people there, and actually

642
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:33,483
it turned out to be 3,000 people.

643
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:38,343
And from that point on, they didn't block the streets anymore.

644
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:41,613
We also evidently put an end to that corruption.

645
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:46,893
One of the things that also generated a lot of corruption was public works.

646
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:52,653
Another thing that led to significant acts of corruption were the

647
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:55,443
discretionary transfers to provinces.

648
00:46:56,003 --> 00:46:59,683
In general, these transfers were made to the provinces with

649
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,063
accounting as obscure as possible.

650
00:47:02,643 --> 00:47:09,833
So, the national government In collusion with the governors, let's say, the money

651
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:12,473
ended up being used for other things.

652
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:16,523
Not only that, with which we have already done many things.

653
00:47:16,743 --> 00:47:21,552
Furthermore, the Ministry of Human Capital is always filing complaints

654
00:47:21,553 --> 00:47:24,567
in court, not in the media in court.

655
00:47:25,798 --> 00:47:31,648
Acts of corruption like never before in Argentine history, not only that, but

656
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:34,018
also in terms of condemning corruption.

657
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:40,027
That is, we have done, for example, two days ago, it was condemned.

658
00:47:41,288 --> 00:47:44,568
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner got a sentence for corruption.

659
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:49,838
I mean, due to corruption, and the next day, that is yesterday, we

660
00:47:49,838 --> 00:47:51,968
took away their privileged pensions.

661
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:55,883
At the same time, we are, for example, we have discovered

662
00:47:55,883 --> 00:48:00,783
that Kirchnerism used disability pensions for acts of corruption.

663
00:48:01,383 --> 00:48:05,683
For example, there is a city that has more disability pensions than people.

664
00:48:06,993 --> 00:48:11,773
In other words, to give you an idea of the things being done in Argentina.

665
00:48:12,353 --> 00:48:15,553
And also in Argentina, we have restored freedom to the judiciary.

666
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,583
We do not pressure the judiciary.

667
00:48:19,362 --> 00:48:22,513
And this is so true that during my government, not only was

668
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:28,013
Cristina convicted, but also the two terrorist attacks carried

669
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:29,693
out by Iran were condemned.

670
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:37,743
If there is a government that is truly fighting against corruption, it is us.

671
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:43,652
Not only that, but also with each deregulation, it is a privilege that we

672
00:48:43,653 --> 00:48:49,523
take away either from a politician, a preliminary company, or a power group.

673
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:53,742
That is also very powerful.

674
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:59,372
No one in Argentina has ever fought against corruption the way we have.

675
00:49:00,542 --> 00:49:03,843
In fact, I will move on to something that is deeply corrupt

676
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:05,793
and one of my great battles.

677
00:49:09,303 --> 00:49:15,133
The corruption of the media and social media, that is to say, I removed the

678
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:19,612
official advertising, that's why you will see, that even though we generate

679
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:26,683
wonderful news, every week in large quantity, the media speak terribly.

680
00:49:27,413 --> 00:49:30,793
In other words, they demand to have a monopoly on the microphone.

681
00:49:31,003 --> 00:49:34,163
That is, they are entitled to insult, hurt, offend, and they

682
00:49:34,173 --> 00:49:35,863
don't want anyone to bother them.

683
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:38,423
And they expect me not to even respond.

684
00:49:38,813 --> 00:49:42,372
That's why a large part of journalism in Argentina hates the X Network.

685
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:45,992
And that's why we, the liberal libertarians, love the X Network.

686
00:49:46,473 --> 00:49:48,442
Because we can all say what we want.

687
00:49:49,108 --> 00:49:54,288
However, let's say these supposed journalists who defend freedom of

688
00:49:54,288 --> 00:49:59,287
expression, actually what they want is to censor the ideas they don't like.

689
00:49:59,837 --> 00:50:03,398
And of course, because they are leftists, because they are wokes, because they

690
00:50:03,398 --> 00:50:08,297
can't stand the competition, because if they had to fight face to face,

691
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:13,573
hand to hand, on a level playing field, When it comes to ideas they would lose

692
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:17,883
because they were a failure in the economic, social, and cultural aspects.

693
00:50:17,953 --> 00:50:21,603
And also, we must not forget that those murderers called socialists

694
00:50:21,623 --> 00:50:24,303
killed 150 million people.

695
00:50:24,693 --> 00:50:27,293
So they clearly cannot fight on equal terms.

696
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:32,328
Therefore, they demand that social networks, have censorship and that

697
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:34,168
the truth cannot be told to them.

698
00:50:35,018 --> 00:50:38,828
Because when you tell a socialist the truth, they cry,

699
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:40,368
claiming it's hate speech.

700
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:41,628
No, it's not hate speech.

701
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:47,178
It's that you are useless people who have ruined the planet.

702
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:49,878
They have made the planet much worse.

703
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:55,218
And fortunately today, thanks to social media, especially due to

704
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:59,458
the enormous and brave work of Elon Musk and the role of Twitter,

705
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:06,923
Today, X, right, allows information to flow, which makes it possible,

706
00:51:07,423 --> 00:51:10,193
let's say, to expose politicians.

707
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:14,223
And also expose the media.

708
00:51:14,783 --> 00:51:17,863
And that's why journalists in Argentina are so violent.

709
00:51:18,123 --> 00:51:18,633
Why?

710
00:51:18,793 --> 00:51:24,593
Because before they could, for instance, a journalist went and for example, he would

711
00:51:24,603 --> 00:51:29,602
go to a person and he would throw a folder at them and say, if you don't give me X

712
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:35,193
amount of money, I am going to publish all of this and tarnish your reputation.

713
00:51:35,603 --> 00:51:40,533
And I know for a fact, a case of a journalist who carried out this extortion

714
00:51:41,143 --> 00:51:45,503
twice to a businessman, that businessman told him that he wasn't going to pay,

715
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:47,953
and evidently the journalist did it.

716
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:50,913
Obviously they went to court, there was a trial, and that

717
00:51:50,913 --> 00:51:52,753
journalist lost both times.

718
00:51:53,953 --> 00:51:55,553
But that process is very slow.

719
00:51:55,553 --> 00:51:57,493
And in the meantime, they smeared.

720
00:51:57,493 --> 00:52:01,503
So since the justice system takes a long time, so what is the problem?

721
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:05,543
The problem is that in the meantime, your life got dirtied.

722
00:52:06,222 --> 00:52:08,312
So why can journalists do all this?

723
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:10,843
Well, that's why they dislike X.

724
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,673
They dislike social media.

725
00:52:12,673 --> 00:52:16,373
They dislike the new form of communication because it took away

726
00:52:16,373 --> 00:52:18,293
their monopoly over the microphone.

727
00:52:18,473 --> 00:52:22,838
And by taking away the monopoly over the microphone, It removed the economic

728
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:28,048
benefits of extortion, so clearly that's another battle I'm fighting.

729
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:34,318
You read a newspaper in Argentina and 85 % of what you read is a lie.

730
00:52:35,308 --> 00:52:40,167
That is to say, the fundamental characteristic of most journalists, not

731
00:52:40,188 --> 00:52:44,498
all, but the vast majority of journalists in Argentina, with some honorable

732
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:51,353
exceptions, is that they are liars, slanderers and defamers, and if the monopoly

733
00:52:51,353 --> 00:52:56,863
they demand were still in place that they want to reign again, I have no doubt that

734
00:52:56,863 --> 00:53:01,183
they would demand money in exchange for silence because that's what they are.

735
00:53:01,663 --> 00:53:04,723
They are extortionists, they are thieves, they are corrupt.

736
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:09,563
And then of course, obviously when you take away a privilege

737
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:11,903
from a sector, they get upset.

738
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:14,153
Well, welcome to freedom.

739
00:53:14,943 --> 00:53:17,373
So you're not only fighting for economic freedom, you're

740
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:18,478
fighting for freedom of speech.

741
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:20,328
Exactly.

742
00:53:20,358 --> 00:53:23,048
I fight for freedom in all aspects of life.

743
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:29,718
That is to say, one of the things that seems most interesting to me is that,

744
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:35,538
uh, when the Berlin Wall fell, it's true that it officially fell in the year

745
00:53:35,538 --> 00:53:43,708
1989, but the reality is that the wall, or socialism, fell in the year 1961.

746
00:53:44,073 --> 00:53:48,423
When they had to build the wall, I mean, they built it because people were leaving

747
00:53:48,423 --> 00:53:51,083
communist Germany for capitalist Germany.

748
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:57,723
They realized that those on the Western side were much better off.

749
00:53:59,012 --> 00:54:02,933
And of course, to prevent people from leaving, they put

750
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:04,813
what a wonderful system, right?

751
00:54:05,112 --> 00:54:07,753
So, I mean, They had to trap people.

752
00:54:07,753 --> 00:54:08,923
They couldn't let them go.

753
00:54:08,923 --> 00:54:13,443
I mean, these are such wonderful ideas that they had to apply them at gunpoint.

754
00:54:13,663 --> 00:54:19,103
It's quite, well, it's no coincidence that they killed 150 million human beings.

755
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:22,123
So, what happened then?

756
00:54:22,873 --> 00:54:27,793
The official fall of the wall in the year 1989 made it clear

757
00:54:27,793 --> 00:54:29,533
that socialism had failed.

758
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:37,723
In that context, the socialists, they moved the discussion of class struggle

759
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:41,688
in economics and took it to other areas.

760
00:54:42,368 --> 00:54:49,408
So for example, socialism, or what is of the 21st century, or cultural

761
00:54:49,438 --> 00:54:54,998
Marxism or post Marxism, whatever definition you want, is to take class

762
00:54:55,007 --> 00:54:58,557
struggle to different aspects of life.

763
00:54:58,807 --> 00:55:03,008
For example, one of the aspects of life where you, let's say,

764
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:06,308
have this, is in gender ideology.

765
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:11,238
I mean, it's incredible, because the first ones to defend equality

766
00:55:11,488 --> 00:55:13,428
before the law were the liberals.

767
00:55:13,948 --> 00:55:16,818
The first to defend women's rights were the liberals.

768
00:55:17,138 --> 00:55:21,567
Jeremy Bentham, in the year 1750, was the first to demand

769
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,478
equality before the law for women.

770
00:55:23,948 --> 00:55:29,508
I mean, the cause of equality, equality before the law for women, and equality

771
00:55:29,508 --> 00:55:33,448
of rights, The first ones who advocated for this were the liberals, did you know?

772
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:37,048
However, what does the left do?

773
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,648
They just go on to radicalize it.

774
00:55:40,698 --> 00:55:43,278
And then it moves to what is called female chauvinism.

775
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:46,728
Female chauvinism is, let's say, the fight against males.

776
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:49,178
And then, I mean, how do they do it?

777
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:50,978
They do it by assigning rights.

778
00:55:51,468 --> 00:55:57,038
But when you assign a right, Someone has to pay for it, and that has consequences.

779
00:55:57,588 --> 00:56:01,078
And in general, let's say, this always happens.

780
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:06,918
The consequences are that the results are worse than what you had before.

781
00:56:06,918 --> 00:56:13,398
I mean, uh, in any state intervention, the subsequent result is often

782
00:56:13,398 --> 00:56:15,168
worse than what you originally had.

783
00:56:15,518 --> 00:56:17,588
So that's one thing.

784
00:56:17,608 --> 00:56:21,528
And not only that, but the other side of this is the environmental agenda,

785
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:27,037
which sets man against nature, involving all aspects of environmentalism and

786
00:56:27,037 --> 00:56:28,947
everything related to climate change.

787
00:56:29,983 --> 00:56:33,363
In other words, they can't stand any serious discussion, therefore all

788
00:56:33,363 --> 00:56:37,633
environmental policies are nothing more than an excuse to collect taxes.

789
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:41,712
So that a group of parasitic bureaucrats can live at the expense

790
00:56:41,713 --> 00:56:44,612
of others and finance sinister ideas.

791
00:56:45,332 --> 00:56:48,472
Where the most sinister idea of all is that there is no room

792
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:50,112
for everyone on planet Earth.

793
00:56:50,882 --> 00:56:56,473
That is, An idea that failed with Malthus at the beginning of the 19th century,

794
00:56:56,473 --> 00:57:01,423
a murderous idea that was also applied by the Egyptians against the Jews.

795
00:57:01,423 --> 00:57:05,833
And this is famously recorded in the book of Shemot or Exodus.

796
00:57:07,013 --> 00:57:10,832
Or for example, another thing is Black Lives Matter.

797
00:57:11,673 --> 00:57:16,493
That is black people against white people or indigenous people against

798
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:18,133
the established communities.

799
00:57:18,988 --> 00:57:25,628
Or, I mean everything related to LGBT agendas, definitely these are some of

800
00:57:25,628 --> 00:57:31,537
the ways in which, you know, socialism extended the class struggle into

801
00:57:31,537 --> 00:57:37,377
other aspects of society, creating divisions and fostering deceit with

802
00:57:37,398 --> 00:57:41,153
the sole purpose of absorbing taxes.

803
00:57:41,453 --> 00:57:44,143
I mean, what was the Ministry of Women in Argentina doing?

804
00:57:44,363 --> 00:57:46,843
Did it manage to reduce a single femicide?

805
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:47,753
No.

806
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:48,873
None at all.

807
00:57:49,022 --> 00:57:51,682
The number of femicides exploded just the same.

808
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,302
In fact, the most feminist president in Argentine history,

809
00:57:55,302 --> 00:57:58,092
Mr. Alberto Fernandez, used to beat his wife.

810
00:57:59,822 --> 00:58:01,813
That is such a strange feminist.

811
00:58:02,113 --> 00:58:07,013
I mean, so, within the ranks of feminists, let's say, you will

812
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:10,913
essentially find the largest number of rapists and women beaters.

813
00:58:11,773 --> 00:58:16,003
And it's, um, quite interesting what they do.

814
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:19,153
Their hypocrisy is truly striking.

815
00:58:19,983 --> 00:58:21,503
It's not just about that, though.

816
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:22,003
I mean,

817
00:58:24,143 --> 00:58:26,103
the battle is on three fronts.

818
00:58:27,363 --> 00:58:32,922
You have the economic front, which is free enterprise capitalism.

819
00:58:34,953 --> 00:58:36,403
Then we have the political level.

820
00:58:37,343 --> 00:58:42,743
Currently, the system that the world has designed is a Republican liberal

821
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,752
democracy with checks and balances.

822
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:53,468
And, I mean, at the cultural battle level, notice that socialism has been

823
00:58:53,468 --> 00:58:55,588
very successful in the cultural battle.

824
00:58:56,608 --> 00:58:59,477
It has been very successful politically because it was able

825
00:58:59,478 --> 00:59:03,788
to translate that political battle in winning many elections.

826
00:59:04,538 --> 00:59:06,087
But why is it falling apart?

827
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:07,247
Why?

828
00:59:07,898 --> 00:59:12,708
Because it produces misery and because the economic system is a disaster,

829
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:16,108
so people eventually realize that it is making things worse for them.

830
00:59:17,608 --> 00:59:21,277
Liberal libertarians are very good when it comes to economics. Yes.

831
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:27,548
And those good economic results can actually lead, well, uh, to the

832
00:59:27,548 --> 00:59:30,038
generation of solid political processes.

833
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:31,588
But what happened?

834
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:34,238
The liberals neglected the cultural battle.

835
00:59:35,628 --> 00:59:39,728
Much of the blame was placed on Fukuyama when he said this is the end of history.

836
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:44,077
No, it was not the end of history because the following year, in 1990,

837
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:49,118
the socialists gathered at the Sao Paulo Forum and based on the ideas of Gramsci,

838
00:59:49,403 --> 00:59:54,133
designed a strategy to infiltrate the media, culture, and education, which

839
00:59:54,143 --> 00:59:56,243
ended up changing the entire discourse.

840
00:59:57,648 --> 01:00:03,278
And they established that what they said was politically correct and

841
01:00:03,278 --> 01:00:07,368
that any idea outside of it was to be considered reactionary and had

842
01:00:07,377 --> 01:00:09,537
to be censored or even persecuted.

843
01:00:10,197 --> 01:00:14,048
And they claimed to be the ones defending freedom, even though they

844
01:00:14,048 --> 01:00:16,138
were the ones persecuting people.

845
01:00:16,227 --> 01:00:19,068
It's the same with journalists who get upset with Twitter.

846
01:00:19,468 --> 01:00:22,538
They say they defend freedom, but can't stand it when those

847
01:00:22,538 --> 01:00:24,118
who think differently speak.

848
01:00:24,178 --> 01:00:25,208
Is that freedom?

849
01:00:25,268 --> 01:00:28,298
Yes for them, but not for those who think differently.

850
01:00:28,398 --> 01:00:30,178
That's not freedom, that's fascism.

851
01:00:30,607 --> 01:00:33,378
Then, what do we say?

852
01:00:33,858 --> 01:00:37,197
Then we must fight on the economic front, and I believe we are implementing an

853
01:00:37,198 --> 01:00:41,377
extremely successful economic program that is being recognized worldwide.

854
01:00:41,817 --> 01:00:47,878
In fact, the other night, the president elect, Donald Trump, indeed

855
01:00:47,888 --> 01:00:52,348
gave recognition for the achievements we are having in Argentina and the

856
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:53,818
speed at which we have done it.

857
01:00:54,638 --> 01:00:57,718
At the same time, you have to fight the political battle because,

858
01:00:57,748 --> 01:01:01,927
well, soccer matches are not won by shouting from the stands.

859
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:04,327
They are won by playing on the field.

860
01:01:04,848 --> 01:01:10,593
But that alone is not enough because you have to let's say you need to convey

861
01:01:10,593 --> 01:01:16,633
to society the values of capitalism, the free market, what liberalism

862
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:23,752
is, the value of freedom, right? and when you succeed in that, then we will

863
01:01:23,752 --> 01:01:25,593
indeed be able to advance steadily.

864
01:01:26,073 --> 01:01:30,133
If you don't fight the cultural battle, what happened in Chile will happen to you.

865
01:01:30,752 --> 01:01:32,413
They had economic success.

866
01:01:33,873 --> 01:01:38,423
It was, let's say, sustained over time, but at some point it collapsed.

867
01:01:38,423 --> 01:01:39,353
Why did it collapse?

868
01:01:39,848 --> 01:01:41,928
Because they hadn't fought the cultural battle.

869
01:01:42,668 --> 01:01:46,718
Then socialism, little by little, took control of institutions

870
01:01:46,738 --> 01:01:49,008
in education and the media.

871
01:01:49,637 --> 01:01:54,118
So, they took over the media and culture, and on that basis, they

872
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:55,808
attacked and broke up the system.

873
01:01:56,617 --> 01:02:00,457
And then they found themselves with increasing doses of socialism, and the

874
01:02:00,457 --> 01:02:02,807
only thing socialism generates is poverty.

875
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:08,347
Therefore, what you must keep in mind, is that you have to

876
01:02:08,347 --> 01:02:09,708
fight the battles on all fronts.

877
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:16,678
And if you don't keep that in mind, I can tell you you are headed towards collapse.

878
01:02:17,588 --> 01:02:22,338
Like you said, in this fight against corruption, you're challenging some very

879
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,088
powerful people, a powerful establishment.

880
01:02:26,738 --> 01:02:29,137
Are you ever afraid for your life?

881
01:02:30,928 --> 01:02:32,398
Potential assassinations?

882
01:02:33,078 --> 01:02:33,578
No.

883
01:02:34,638 --> 01:02:37,018
Tell me what good is it to live life?

884
01:02:38,148 --> 01:02:39,718
I mean, in slavery?

885
01:02:41,783 --> 01:02:47,603
Look, there is a song, um, by a Spanish singer called Nino Bravo.

886
01:02:49,063 --> 01:02:53,283
Just to be clear, he has already left this earth, so we can say

887
01:02:53,283 --> 01:02:56,122
he has passed on to the beyond.

888
01:02:57,703 --> 01:02:59,113
The song is called Libre.

889
01:03:00,703 --> 01:03:06,653
And the song, it tells the story of Peter Fetcher, an 18 year old boy

890
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:10,313
who, when the separation was made,

891
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:18,258
and I mean, the construction of the Berlin Wall begins, His family

892
01:03:18,258 --> 01:03:21,488
ends up on the Western side and he accidentally ends up on the Eastern side.

893
01:03:23,178 --> 01:03:29,488
And for a whole year, he plans his escape to the Western side, right?

894
01:03:30,428 --> 01:03:34,878
And in that context, when he tries to escape, he gets murdered.

895
01:03:36,877 --> 01:03:41,568
So really, what is the point of life if it's not in freedom, right?

896
01:03:43,418 --> 01:03:46,728
I mean, what is the point of living without fighting for your values?

897
01:03:47,973 --> 01:03:50,893
If I am willing to give my life for my values, then what is the

898
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,353
point of living without freedom?

899
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:55,303
Look, can I tell you something interesting that happened to

900
01:03:55,313 --> 01:03:56,842
me here in the United States?

901
01:03:59,772 --> 01:04:09,462
I, let's say, back in the year 1998, I came to the United States, to take a

902
01:04:09,462 --> 01:04:12,263
series of courses to improve my English,

903
01:04:14,342 --> 01:04:17,463
which I never use in formal terms because as president, as you can

904
01:04:17,463 --> 01:04:20,943
imagine, if I make a mistake, I can create a serious situation.

905
01:04:22,253 --> 01:04:28,363
Fortunately, I have an interpreter who is a superstar, and if I make a

906
01:04:28,363 --> 01:04:32,883
mistake even in Spanish, he corrects me in the version of the other language.

907
01:04:34,263 --> 01:04:37,853
And so back then, in that year, I went to San Francisco.

908
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:41,383
And I visited Alcatraz.

909
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:50,123
You're young, but, I mean, the visit was an audio tour.

910
01:04:50,993 --> 01:04:52,063
You got a walkman.

911
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:57,043
And you would choose the different tracks and listen to the story.

912
01:04:58,053 --> 01:05:01,863
The most interesting thing is that the Alcatraz tour ended in the

913
01:05:01,863 --> 01:05:07,773
recreation yard, where the basketball court, exercise areas, and all

914
01:05:07,783 --> 01:05:10,333
recreational facilities were located.

915
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:14,743
So anyone would have thought that this was the best part of Alcatraz.

916
01:05:17,133 --> 01:05:20,183
And yet, what they said in the guide was that that was the

917
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:21,733
hardest part for the inmates.

918
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:23,233
Why?

919
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:27,793
Because, I mean, that recreation area, in particular, is built,

920
01:05:28,813 --> 01:05:30,453
in front of the San Francisco Bay.

921
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:37,252
So, the inmates could all see how San Francisco continued to build up

922
01:05:37,252 --> 01:05:39,433
and evolve and develop every day.

923
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:43,663
While they were locked up in there, they couldn't take part in that.

924
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:48,353
They were confined in that prison, and that made them fully

925
01:05:48,383 --> 01:05:50,463
aware of the value of freedom.

926
01:05:53,393 --> 01:05:59,292
In my experience, for me, the fight for freedom is, is relentless, okay?

927
01:05:59,943 --> 01:06:03,133
I mean, my greatest hero in all of human history is Moses.

928
01:06:04,353 --> 01:06:10,853
The feat of Moses is like one person alone with his brother Aaron, both

929
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:19,333
confronting the combined forces of The United States, China, and Russia together.

930
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:23,473
And it was Moses who said to Ramses, let my people go.

931
01:06:25,313 --> 01:06:30,443
Well, Ramses resisted, and the forces of heaven ran him over.

932
01:06:31,682 --> 01:06:33,023
But what I mean is,

933
01:06:35,562 --> 01:06:38,972
I don't see any other possible way to live other than with freedom.

934
01:06:39,493 --> 01:06:41,793
And I would always fight for full freedom.

935
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:44,883
And I would be at the forefront of this cause.

936
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:51,253
I mean, it's a cause that I'm going to die with my boots on.

937
01:06:51,313 --> 01:06:54,903
I mean, I'm not going to make do with living any other

938
01:06:54,903 --> 01:06:56,292
way other than with freedom.

939
01:06:56,732 --> 01:06:57,763
I will fight everything.

940
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,292
I'm going to fight as much as it takes.

941
01:07:00,113 --> 01:07:02,483
Uh, at least that's the way I feel.

942
01:07:02,993 --> 01:07:06,583
So what good is it to be alive if you're confined?

943
01:07:07,203 --> 01:07:09,733
What good is it to be alive if you're not free?

944
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:11,263
It's no good.

945
01:07:12,523 --> 01:07:18,523
What good was it for Peter Fetcher to be alive in communist Germany?

946
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:25,848
Well, at least he had a moment of happiness while he tried to escape.

947
01:07:26,978 --> 01:07:30,128
Another guy who fights for freedom, freedom of speech in this case

948
01:07:30,128 --> 01:07:33,397
is your new friend, Elon Musk.

949
01:07:33,398 --> 01:07:39,438
What do you admire and what have you learned from your interactions with Elon?

950
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:40,577
I have.

951
01:07:41,908 --> 01:07:44,317
A huge admiration for Elon Musk.

952
01:07:45,998 --> 01:07:47,338
He is, uh,

953
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:53,188
He is an absolutely unconventional person.

954
01:07:55,258 --> 01:07:57,367
He's a great fighter for the ideas of freedom.

955
01:07:57,778 --> 01:08:05,778
What he has done on Twitter, now known as X, and how he is helping

956
01:08:05,778 --> 01:08:08,408
the world nowadays.

957
01:08:09,558 --> 01:08:14,288
to wake up once and for all and become aware of the socialist virus, the

958
01:08:14,288 --> 01:08:19,846
woke virus, that in itself makes him a hero in the history of humanity.

959
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,448
But it's not just that.

960
01:08:25,497 --> 01:08:30,058
One of the things that happened to me is that when I went to first talk

961
01:08:30,058 --> 01:08:34,837
to him, I thought, I was going to meet a successful businessman.

962
01:08:35,462 --> 01:08:40,783
And that I would have a typical successful businessman conversation who understands

963
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,742
business and that some of his business is some of his business slightly more exotic.

964
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:50,162
That's the kind of talk you would expect to have.

965
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:55,298
And business people are truly admirable, right?

966
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:57,678
Because they are true benefactors of society.

967
01:08:59,888 --> 01:09:04,258
They're usually very much focused on their own business.

968
01:09:05,697 --> 01:09:12,127
And one of the things that really, really shocked me, when I met

969
01:09:12,138 --> 01:09:19,448
Elon Musk, we had scheduled a meeting for no more than 15 minutes.

970
01:09:20,528 --> 01:09:21,968
The first time we were in the meeting.

971
01:09:22,808 --> 01:09:27,488
For a little over 45 minutes because he was about to miss his flight.

972
01:09:28,037 --> 01:09:31,567
So obviously if someone as important as him doesn't fly as

973
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,968
planned, it has to be rescheduled.

974
01:09:34,207 --> 01:09:36,328
And he loses a lot of hours.

975
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:39,218
Imagine, every minute is very valuable.

976
01:09:40,228 --> 01:09:45,133
And And one of the things that happened was that,

977
01:09:47,193 --> 01:09:52,693
basically, he brought up the topic of demography and we started

978
01:09:52,703 --> 01:09:54,533
discussing demographics and growth.

979
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:59,053
I never imagined that I would end up discussing demographics

980
01:09:59,053 --> 01:10:00,953
and growth with him, you know?

981
01:10:02,302 --> 01:10:07,753
And another very fun, Thing was that, something funny he said to

982
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:13,113
me was that since we shared our vision regarding demographic issues,

983
01:10:14,113 --> 01:10:17,573
and the need to populate the planet, he asked me, now, what about you?

984
01:10:18,143 --> 01:10:19,743
When are you going to move in that direction?

985
01:10:19,743 --> 01:10:21,712
I mean, I said, Oh, look, I have five children.

986
01:10:22,153 --> 01:10:24,903
And he said, well, the four legged ones don't count.

987
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:32,143
Uh, that was, uh, the first, the first meeting I had with Elon Musk, the second,

988
01:10:32,503 --> 01:10:42,578
the second meeting was, When here at the universities, we started seeing anti-

989
01:10:42,578 --> 01:10:47,148
Semitic demonstrations where basically Palestinian flags were displayed and

990
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,238
Jews were harassed and persecuted.

991
01:10:51,118 --> 01:10:58,348
And, at that moment when we had that second meeting, he showed himself to be

992
01:10:58,348 --> 01:11:03,298
very deeply involved with that and brought up the issue of the cultural battle.

993
01:11:04,118 --> 01:11:09,458
So, I mean, it's not quite conventional, even in the political field.

994
01:11:11,128 --> 01:11:18,003
During our last talk, which lasted for about two and a half hours, right?

995
01:11:19,823 --> 01:11:24,263
One of the things we talked about was freedom and what was at stake for the

996
01:11:24,263 --> 01:11:27,763
United States in this, in this election.

997
01:11:28,643 --> 01:11:37,013
Uh, therefore he is a person, you know, honestly, uh, I can say.

998
01:11:37,528 --> 01:11:39,378
He is well above average.

999
01:11:40,068 --> 01:11:44,988
I mean, a person of unconventional intelligence, right?

1000
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:48,078
And also he is very charming.

1001
01:11:48,078 --> 01:11:53,718
So I mean, again, I have a great admiration for him and I really

1002
01:11:53,728 --> 01:11:55,987
interact very closely with him.

1003
01:11:56,718 --> 01:12:00,908
He is very interested in what our ministry of deregulation is doing,

1004
01:12:01,798 --> 01:12:06,338
which seeks to remove regulations, but at the same time, he works with

1005
01:12:06,338 --> 01:12:11,018
another person who is also interested in the chainsaw approach, and so.

1006
01:12:13,878 --> 01:12:18,988
I'm very pleased because they are going to try and replicate the model

1007
01:12:19,018 --> 01:12:20,998
we are implementing in Argentina.

1008
01:12:21,458 --> 01:12:26,178
And also, uh, Donald Trump himself is very enthusiastic about this.

1009
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:31,288
So and anything in the way of reducing regulations and cutting public spending

1010
01:12:31,567 --> 01:12:35,427
and taking government out of the equation means more freedom for the people.

1011
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:42,248
So I'm very pleased with what's going on and with Trump's victory because

1012
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:44,108
the United States will be better off.

1013
01:12:45,308 --> 01:12:47,138
Argentina is going to be better too.

1014
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,618
And the whole world is going to be better off.

1015
01:12:49,848 --> 01:12:53,348
Today, the world is a much better place than it was just a few days ago.

1016
01:12:54,128 --> 01:12:59,028
Like you said, Elon and Vivek Ramaswamy are heading the DOGE,

1017
01:12:59,038 --> 01:13:00,767
Department of Government Efficiency.

1018
01:13:01,018 --> 01:13:05,668
So from your experience this year as president of Argentina and every

1019
01:13:06,128 --> 01:13:10,098
chainsaw economic policies that you've implemented, what advice would

1020
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:13,998
you give to Elon and Vivek about how to do it in the United States?

1021
01:13:14,828 --> 01:13:16,218
Just cut to the chase.

1022
01:13:16,728 --> 01:13:17,738
Cut to the chase.

1023
01:13:18,028 --> 01:13:18,878
Simple as that.

1024
01:13:19,148 --> 01:13:20,738
I'll tell you a story and you're going to love it.

1025
01:13:24,373 --> 01:13:29,773
Currently in Argentina, due to, to the political balance we've achieved, we

1026
01:13:29,773 --> 01:13:35,783
have had certain powers delegated from Congress to the executive branch, and

1027
01:13:35,783 --> 01:13:38,563
therefore, we can resolve it by decree

1028
01:13:40,723 --> 01:13:46,513
that the regulation minister, Federico Sturzenegger, in his ministry, shows a

1029
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:52,723
counter that displays in front of everyone there, He displays the number of days,

1030
01:13:52,753 --> 01:13:59,193
alright, during which the delegated powers will continue to be valid.

1031
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:05,682
Therefore, he has a whole deregulation division, also a public spending

1032
01:14:05,683 --> 01:14:09,812
cut division, and government structure reduction division.

1033
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:15,973
And he also has an elite core that's cleaning up all of the laws that hinder

1034
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:18,293
the economic system and progress.

1035
01:14:19,363 --> 01:14:24,523
And every day, he removes between one and five economic restrictions.

1036
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:30,223
So, my advice would be for them to go all the way, to push it to the very limit.

1037
01:14:31,663 --> 01:14:32,903
And do not give up.

1038
01:14:33,533 --> 01:14:34,993
Do not let down their guard.

1039
01:14:35,923 --> 01:14:39,493
Furthermore, that agenda does not have political purpose.

1040
01:14:39,873 --> 01:14:43,233
Because at the end of the day, you are removing privileges.

1041
01:14:43,882 --> 01:14:48,232
Of course, there will be people complaining, but those are people, these

1042
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:49,883
are people who are losing privileges.

1043
01:14:49,883 --> 01:14:54,262
So they will have to explain to society why they are keeping those privileges.

1044
01:14:54,763 --> 01:14:56,403
And that is quite uncomfortable.

1045
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,023
You've spoken with Donald Trump.

1046
01:14:59,183 --> 01:15:01,253
Allegedly, he called you his favorite president.

1047
01:15:01,538 --> 01:15:03,008
What did you discuss?

1048
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:07,398
And maybe again, what do you admire about President Trump

1049
01:15:07,788 --> 01:15:09,358
and what do you learn from him?

1050
01:15:10,148 --> 01:15:16,027
There are several things that I, I admire about President Trump.

1051
01:15:17,128 --> 01:15:23,198
The first is that he probably I think he's provided ample proof

1052
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:25,148
of this in his first presidency.

1053
01:15:25,568 --> 01:15:28,278
He understands the nature of the cultural battle.

1054
01:15:29,748 --> 01:15:32,408
He has openly confronted socialism.

1055
01:15:32,408 --> 01:15:35,447
His speeches openly target socialism.

1056
01:15:35,718 --> 01:15:39,108
He perfectly understands the woke virus.

1057
01:15:40,627 --> 01:15:47,008
And that, that is, uh, you know, of great value.

1058
01:15:47,258 --> 01:15:49,618
Because it means understanding what it's all about.

1059
01:15:50,358 --> 01:15:53,918
Another thing I truly admire about him is his courage.

1060
01:15:54,728 --> 01:15:55,528
In fact,

1061
01:15:58,848 --> 01:16:02,378
thankfully, thank goodness he didn't get assassinated or killed.

1062
01:16:03,288 --> 01:16:07,247
But it was by a small chance occurrence that could have killed him, just

1063
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:09,038
because he moved at the right moment.

1064
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:16,048
And yet, that didn't intimidate him and he went on.

1065
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:25,073
And in fact, during his first campaign, and in this one as well, In the second

1066
01:16:25,073 --> 01:16:31,603
one and third one, they criticized him, insulted him, offended him, said

1067
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:36,313
awful things about him, made up all sorts of horrible stories about him.

1068
01:16:37,133 --> 01:16:45,098
In that respect, I can say I deeply relate because probably no one in our

1069
01:16:45,098 --> 01:16:50,188
history has had such a negative campaign from all the media like they did to me,

1070
01:16:50,728 --> 01:16:53,798
but let's say they were quite similar.

1071
01:16:54,627 --> 01:16:56,108
This is why it's so interesting.

1072
01:16:56,108 --> 01:17:01,588
And I was so deeply moved when last night I also got to meet Sylvester Stallone,

1073
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:10,543
you know, because, uh, Sylvester Stallone talks about, well, how important is that

1074
01:17:10,553 --> 01:17:15,943
no matter how hard they hit you and keep on hitting you all the time, despite all

1075
01:17:15,943 --> 01:17:18,113
that you keep going on and on and on.

1076
01:17:19,213 --> 01:17:27,072
What I'm trying to say is that many of the, uh, many, so many of

1077
01:17:27,082 --> 01:17:31,943
Sylvester Stallone's approaches are truly inspirational, don't you think?

1078
01:17:32,408 --> 01:17:37,248
So imagine I'm about to give the speech and I see Sylvester Stallone

1079
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:39,078
and Sylvester Stallone knows me.

1080
01:17:39,628 --> 01:17:41,227
It was truly insane.

1081
01:17:41,588 --> 01:17:43,238
I had to pinch myself.

1082
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:45,198
I mean, this can't be true.

1083
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:49,998
And besides, well, the people were wonderful with me last night.

1084
01:17:50,017 --> 01:17:51,708
They've been wonderful today.

1085
01:17:51,908 --> 01:17:54,008
I've taken hundreds of selfies.

1086
01:17:54,698 --> 01:18:01,928
I mean, it's truly been I would say it's been my break, let me say, after

1087
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:07,288
almost a year in office and having to face all sorts of media torture

1088
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:11,128
because so, because the journalists who have vested interests and are

1089
01:18:11,128 --> 01:18:13,897
corrupt are professional torturers.

1090
01:18:14,673 --> 01:18:19,983
Yes, because they invade your personal life, your family, and your privacy.

1091
01:18:20,233 --> 01:18:22,453
Let me tell you something to show you the kind of garbage

1092
01:18:22,453 --> 01:18:24,063
the media in Argentina can do.

1093
01:18:24,603 --> 01:18:27,732
They sent three drones to spy on me at my presidential residence.

1094
01:18:28,293 --> 01:18:29,243
To spy on me?

1095
01:18:29,952 --> 01:18:30,903
Do you think that's right?

1096
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:33,063
Exactly.

1097
01:18:33,613 --> 01:18:36,833
But that kind of thing happens in Argentina, not to mention the many

1098
01:18:36,833 --> 01:18:38,663
lies and horrible things they say.

1099
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:44,313
I, for instance, remember that time when my father was hospitalized.

1100
01:18:44,993 --> 01:18:49,213
My father is a man of a really strong character who has had

1101
01:18:50,523 --> 01:18:52,352
two heart surgeries, alright?

1102
01:18:53,733 --> 01:18:57,593
And one day a journalist was saying all sorts of lies about my father.

1103
01:18:58,698 --> 01:19:04,718
My father was hospitalized and, well, and he almost died of a heart attack.

1104
01:19:05,968 --> 01:19:09,418
So that kind of thing is what journalism and the press do in Argentina.

1105
01:19:10,008 --> 01:19:14,988
So they start to attack your private life, your mother, your father, your sister,

1106
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:17,248
even my dogs that I absolutely adore.

1107
01:19:17,508 --> 01:19:20,328
They are the most wonderful beings in the universe.

1108
01:19:20,557 --> 01:19:23,058
They even target my four legged children.

1109
01:19:24,278 --> 01:19:30,128
So, Imagine that I've been in office for nearly a year, a year as president.

1110
01:19:30,168 --> 01:19:36,018
And since they can't criticize my management, except by lying and distorting

1111
01:19:36,018 --> 01:19:41,007
the numbers, they meddle with all these things, things they have been

1112
01:19:41,018 --> 01:19:47,028
doing all the time since the year 2021 when I officially entered politics.

1113
01:19:47,898 --> 01:19:52,428
So, and I've seen what they've done to Trump.

1114
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:56,538
So that also makes me relate a lot to him.

1115
01:19:57,273 --> 01:19:58,753
Because he's a true warrior.

1116
01:19:58,763 --> 01:20:01,693
He's truly, he's a Viking.

1117
01:20:01,803 --> 01:20:02,653
He's a Viking.

1118
01:20:02,663 --> 01:20:04,153
He's literally a Viking.

1119
01:20:05,293 --> 01:20:11,773
I mean, he is someone I admire for how he has kept fighting in the face

1120
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:14,713
of adversity, even against all odds.

1121
01:20:15,403 --> 01:20:17,333
And still he managed to win.

1122
01:20:18,533 --> 01:20:19,233
Amazing.

1123
01:20:21,273 --> 01:20:25,843
And well, uh, and that's why I can relate that much.

1124
01:20:26,663 --> 01:20:32,043
And I've also seen how he's been unfairly criticized, like when he was accused

1125
01:20:32,043 --> 01:20:34,283
of protectionism or when he wanted.

1126
01:20:35,088 --> 01:20:39,828
To discuss some matters within the context of public debate regarding

1127
01:20:39,828 --> 01:20:46,208
the design of monetary policy as regards the Fed and, uh, basically,

1128
01:20:46,218 --> 01:20:47,907
they have accused him of things.

1129
01:20:48,558 --> 01:20:51,578
I mean, isn't he entitled to give an opinion as a president?

1130
01:20:52,297 --> 01:20:56,237
I mean, any citizen could give their opinion, even more so a president.

1131
01:20:56,887 --> 01:21:00,568
Why is it important to you that Argentina has a close relationship

1132
01:21:00,578 --> 01:21:01,608
with the United States?

1133
01:21:03,168 --> 01:21:06,428
Well, to us, that is truly important, okay?

1134
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:06,928
Okay.

1135
01:21:07,983 --> 01:21:13,333
You know, because we've decided to be geopolitical allies of the United

1136
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:21,172
States ever since our campaign, that our allies, we have decided that our

1137
01:21:21,203 --> 01:21:27,212
allies will be the United States and Israel because they basically represent

1138
01:21:27,222 --> 01:21:29,312
the ideas of the Western world.

1139
01:21:29,323 --> 01:21:31,223
They represent the free world.

1140
01:21:31,603 --> 01:21:36,053
That is to say what we would call today, let's say a liberal democracy,

1141
01:21:36,353 --> 01:21:39,882
okay, by confronting the autocrats.

1142
01:21:40,613 --> 01:21:44,243
And in that sense, that is the geopolitical alignment.

1143
01:21:44,803 --> 01:21:49,253
Moreover, in our campaign, we were very, very clear on three main points.

1144
01:21:49,602 --> 01:21:55,483
One, The economic pillar, we talked about cutting public spending and I would

1145
01:21:55,483 --> 01:21:57,443
make my appearances with a chainsaw.

1146
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:01,913
We talked about economic freedom, deregulation that is, and I talked

1147
01:22:01,913 --> 01:22:03,833
about a competition of currencies.

1148
01:22:04,303 --> 01:22:06,993
And people, you know, obviously were interested in the dollar.

1149
01:22:07,522 --> 01:22:11,343
So it was obvious that the economic policy was clear, alright?

1150
01:22:11,763 --> 01:22:14,382
And not only was it clear but we are also fulfilling it.

1151
01:22:15,012 --> 01:22:16,743
That is the first point.

1152
01:22:17,153 --> 01:22:19,293
Second was our policy on security.

1153
01:22:19,503 --> 01:22:21,432
The idea being to fight crime.

1154
01:22:22,768 --> 01:22:25,658
I mean, relentlessly as well as security.

1155
01:22:26,478 --> 01:22:27,518
No mercy, right?

1156
01:22:28,308 --> 01:22:34,378
And in fact, in Argentina, there are no more roadblocks, which

1157
01:22:34,378 --> 01:22:36,358
they said were impossible to end.

1158
01:22:37,028 --> 01:22:41,307
Not only that, we have strengthened the security forces and also our armed forces,

1159
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:45,878
and we are waging a tough battle against drug trafficking and narco terrorism.

1160
01:22:46,187 --> 01:22:48,698
Therefore, we are also strongly fulfilling that.

1161
01:22:48,988 --> 01:22:53,348
Notice that these two points, which were the main concerns, they were

1162
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:55,598
the biggest concerns of Argentinians.

1163
01:22:56,398 --> 01:22:59,298
When we took office are now in fifth and sixth place.

1164
01:22:59,658 --> 01:23:04,528
Today, the problem for Argentinians is corruption, whether there is unemployment,

1165
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:09,878
if there is poverty, but they don't mention inflation and insecurity anymore.

1166
01:23:10,598 --> 01:23:14,987
And besides a third point that I made clear was that I would align with the

1167
01:23:15,058 --> 01:23:17,318
United States and Israel internationally.

1168
01:23:17,918 --> 01:23:18,488
And.

1169
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:23,443
You know, at my campaign rallies, there would be groups that would

1170
01:23:23,443 --> 01:23:25,633
come along with flags of Israel.

1171
01:23:26,823 --> 01:23:32,032
So it's clear that our international policy approach was always very clear.

1172
01:23:32,702 --> 01:23:37,713
And, uh, this is something I state during my speeches when I talk

1173
01:23:37,723 --> 01:23:41,582
about the values of the West and the civilization of the West.

1174
01:23:42,132 --> 01:23:50,203
In fact, yesterday, And even more so today, during my speeches, I talked about

1175
01:23:51,043 --> 01:23:56,862
how the different Greek groups or tribes go together to confront the Persians.

1176
01:23:58,623 --> 01:24:04,342
That is to say, it seemed that from that time 500 years before Christ until

1177
01:24:04,342 --> 01:24:07,453
today, that struggle continues, right?

1178
01:24:08,503 --> 01:24:18,603
Um, but well, so of course we're all in, we are betting on the United States

1179
01:24:18,613 --> 01:24:23,073
becoming once again a leader in the West.

1180
01:24:24,063 --> 01:24:30,513
We needed someone to come back to make America great again and,

1181
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:34,083
and that as part of that process.

1182
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:38,333
Being a commercial ally is also a great idea.

1183
01:24:39,213 --> 01:24:43,153
So we would really like to move forward and deepen our trade

1184
01:24:43,163 --> 01:24:50,322
ties and our investment ties, you know, and well, we would also like

1185
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,293
to be part of the NATO as well.

1186
01:24:52,813 --> 01:24:54,153
Do you think it's still possible?

1187
01:24:54,163 --> 01:24:57,502
One of the radical ideas you had as you were running for president was to

1188
01:24:57,503 --> 01:25:01,983
dollarize, uh, the Argentine economy.

1189
01:25:02,073 --> 01:25:03,943
Do you think that's still a good idea?

1190
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:05,212
Are you still thinking about that?

1191
01:25:05,878 --> 01:25:07,298
Let's see, let's break it down.

1192
01:25:07,308 --> 01:25:13,238
Let's say I, if you review all, all my statements, I talk

1193
01:25:13,248 --> 01:25:15,178
about currency competition.

1194
01:25:16,668 --> 01:25:19,138
I'm not strictly talking about dollarization.

1195
01:25:19,678 --> 01:25:23,348
I'm talking about currency competition and eliminating the central bank.

1196
01:25:24,068 --> 01:25:28,273
If people later decide to embrace the dollar, That is their choice.

1197
01:25:29,043 --> 01:25:33,133
Ultimately, in the model I propose, what happens is the formation

1198
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:37,333
of a currency basket tailored to the needs of individuals.

1199
01:25:38,353 --> 01:25:41,182
But, I won't avoid the discussion.

1200
01:25:41,373 --> 01:25:43,293
Today there is currency competition.

1201
01:25:43,553 --> 01:25:47,083
If, for instance, today in Argentina you want to make transactions in any

1202
01:25:47,143 --> 01:25:49,593
currency, you can do it, and it's allowed.

1203
01:25:49,963 --> 01:25:51,853
Today there is currency competition.

1204
01:25:52,308 --> 01:25:55,828
The other thing we talk about is the concept of, let's suppose we

1205
01:25:55,828 --> 01:25:59,998
were discussing dollarization, we talk about endogenous dollarization.

1206
01:26:02,378 --> 01:26:05,208
The first point is that you need to clean up the central bank.

1207
01:26:06,177 --> 01:26:07,897
We had to deal with the issue of the C.I.R.A.

1208
01:26:09,078 --> 01:26:12,037
That is the central bank's commercial debt, which was 50 billion.

1209
01:26:12,788 --> 01:26:16,247
We still have to resolve the dividend problem of 10 billion.

1210
01:26:16,628 --> 01:26:20,218
And in the meantime, we did a write off and cleaned up the central

1211
01:26:20,228 --> 01:26:22,238
bank's balance sheet by 45 billion dollars.

1212
01:26:23,188 --> 01:26:27,478
So you can't just close the central bank if it is bankrupt because you need

1213
01:26:27,478 --> 01:26:31,288
to redeem the whole central bank debt, which is about the issuing of money

1214
01:26:31,298 --> 01:26:33,088
and the interest bearing liabilities.

1215
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:37,398
So once we finished with the interest bearing liabilities, it'll

1216
01:26:37,398 --> 01:26:39,198
leave us with the monetary base.

1217
01:26:40,653 --> 01:26:45,413
Therefore, today we have a regime where the amount of money is fixed, the monetary

1218
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:50,203
base is not growing, and as demand for money increases since people can use

1219
01:26:50,213 --> 01:26:55,683
dollars, they don't need to go and sell the dollars and make the peso appreciate,

1220
01:26:56,043 --> 01:26:58,413
but they can do transactions in dollars.

1221
01:26:59,223 --> 01:27:02,593
So, as the economy grows, you will have a greater share of

1222
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:04,723
dollars relative to pesos.

1223
01:27:05,203 --> 01:27:09,013
And at some point, the amount of pesos compared to the dollars will

1224
01:27:09,033 --> 01:27:15,623
be so huge, relatively, that closing down the central bank will be done

1225
01:27:15,623 --> 01:27:18,232
easily, which means this is working.

1226
01:27:19,453 --> 01:27:23,313
Of course, if you were to give me the money right now, I

1227
01:27:23,313 --> 01:27:25,113
would go ahead and dollarize.

1228
01:27:25,733 --> 01:27:27,363
I'd have no problem with that.

1229
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:31,893
For example, I did have a proposal for this, and this could have worked.

1230
01:27:32,653 --> 01:27:33,743
Because the bonds.

1231
01:27:34,503 --> 01:27:38,403
Because the largest creditor of the Argentine treasury is the central bank.

1232
01:27:40,173 --> 01:27:43,163
But central bank bonds were trading at 20 cents.

1233
01:27:43,433 --> 01:27:47,622
If I had sold those bonds at 20 cents, and nowadays, they

1234
01:27:47,622 --> 01:27:50,323
are trading between 60 and 70.

1235
01:27:51,653 --> 01:27:56,253
With the whole bunch of Neanderthals that are the opposition, who

1236
01:27:56,283 --> 01:28:02,512
besides being ignorant in economics, also have bad intentions.

1237
01:28:03,463 --> 01:28:04,653
I would be in jail today.

1238
01:28:05,593 --> 01:28:09,053
Let me ask you a very important, difficult question.

1239
01:28:09,393 --> 01:28:14,763
I'm a huge fan, have been my whole life of Diego Maradona and Messi.

1240
01:28:15,243 --> 01:28:18,443
So who to you is the greatest football player of all time?

1241
01:28:18,783 --> 01:28:21,212
The way I see it, I have seen Maradona play.

1242
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:21,712
Alright.

1243
01:28:24,502 --> 01:28:26,292
I saw Maradona play in the past.

1244
01:28:26,293 --> 01:28:31,283
I used to watch him and I saw him during his last year at Argentino Juniors.

1245
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:36,043
Before Boca Juniors in the year 1980.

1246
01:28:36,093 --> 01:28:39,123
And I saw him in 81 playing for Boca.

1247
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:43,753
I saw him play in the youth selection in Japan in 1979.

1248
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:51,163
I truly have immensely enjoyed the talent of Maradona,

1249
01:28:53,352 --> 01:28:57,628
but without a doubt, The best soccer player of all time, not just from

1250
01:28:57,628 --> 01:29:03,288
Argentina, of all time, even better than Pele, is Messi, of course.

1251
01:29:04,118 --> 01:29:10,078
There is an article which is quite old already now, titled, Messi is Impossible.

1252
01:29:11,558 --> 01:29:17,128
And it looks at all of the positions a soccer player plays in.

1253
01:29:19,028 --> 01:29:25,068
That is, all positions a soccer player can play in from midfield forward, okay?

1254
01:29:27,188 --> 01:29:32,413
And the most incredible thing is that Messi is the best

1255
01:29:32,793 --> 01:29:34,823
in each of those positions.

1256
01:29:36,373 --> 01:29:38,853
You can be the best in one or two positions.

1257
01:29:39,243 --> 01:29:45,423
You see, Cristiano Ronaldo, for example, was very good in two areas of the game,

1258
01:29:46,132 --> 01:29:52,042
so much so that he was almost like Messi, but he didn't take part in the rest.

1259
01:29:52,898 --> 01:29:57,898
However, Messi is the best one in all respects, but at that time, of course.

1260
01:29:58,313 --> 01:30:02,753
Nowadays, you know, he is an older player, right?

1261
01:30:03,823 --> 01:30:11,623
And, and I'm not sure whether he can still keep that performance on all fronts,

1262
01:30:11,652 --> 01:30:16,293
but, uh, but honestly, I have never in my life seen a player like Messi.

1263
01:30:16,742 --> 01:30:19,903
I have never seen no one like him, for real.

1264
01:30:20,593 --> 01:30:25,223
If you look at the number of goals he scored, I correct that, considering

1265
01:30:25,223 --> 01:30:27,083
the goal average in the days of PelÃ©.

1266
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:32,753
Compared to Messi's golden era and his career now, the number of equivalent

1267
01:30:32,763 --> 01:30:35,343
goals is much greater than that of PelÃ©.

1268
01:30:35,353 --> 01:30:41,113
Therefore, without a doubt, Messi is the greatest soccer player of all time.

1269
01:30:41,312 --> 01:30:43,983
Of all time, no one compares to him.

1270
01:30:44,593 --> 01:30:48,043
But it's not just the numbers or the World Cup win.

1271
01:30:49,643 --> 01:30:52,163
It's the moments of genius on the field.

1272
01:30:53,062 --> 01:30:55,812
Messi is unlike any other in that way.

1273
01:30:55,812 --> 01:30:59,713
Messi does things that seem technically impossible.

1274
01:30:59,723 --> 01:31:01,713
They seem physically impossible.

1275
01:31:02,643 --> 01:31:05,223
The moves he makes don't respect human logic.

1276
01:31:05,223 --> 01:31:07,333
It's like watching Usain Bolt run.

1277
01:31:08,233 --> 01:31:09,523
It doesn't feel possible.

1278
01:31:10,643 --> 01:31:14,753
He moves in a way that doesn't respect human logic.

1279
01:31:14,782 --> 01:31:15,512
Am I right?

1280
01:31:15,622 --> 01:31:19,473
Did you watch the 1986 World Cup with Maradona?

1281
01:31:19,633 --> 01:31:21,163
With, uh, with the hand of God?

1282
01:31:21,213 --> 01:31:22,693
With, uh, the game against England?

1283
01:31:22,733 --> 01:31:23,613
What was that like?

1284
01:31:24,113 --> 01:31:24,783
Oh, yes.

1285
01:31:25,388 --> 01:31:27,198
I do remember that very well.

1286
01:31:28,338 --> 01:31:37,088
Uh, we watched it in the home of, um, of my godfather and saw how he did his gambit

1287
01:31:37,288 --> 01:31:44,438
and dodged the team, the England team that was truly, uh, it was absolutely,

1288
01:31:46,687 --> 01:31:48,548
absolutely indescribable.

1289
01:31:48,558 --> 01:31:50,667
There's no way to put it into words.

1290
01:31:51,668 --> 01:31:54,778
It's as if I asked you to describe for me

1291
01:31:56,998 --> 01:31:59,108
the love you have for your partner.

1292
01:31:59,108 --> 01:32:00,608
You can't do that, right?

1293
01:32:01,118 --> 01:32:03,638
I mean, it's something wonderful.

1294
01:32:04,347 --> 01:32:05,767
You can't describe it.

1295
01:32:05,788 --> 01:32:07,748
You cannot put it into words.

1296
01:32:08,527 --> 01:32:15,817
There are things where words, I mean, you know, just seem to fail.

1297
01:32:15,818 --> 01:32:16,418
Am I right?

1298
01:32:17,138 --> 01:32:23,608
I really think that, uh, there are times when humans or some

1299
01:32:23,608 --> 01:32:27,853
humans Not all of them, actually.

1300
01:32:28,223 --> 01:32:34,003
Some humans have the privilege of being able to vibrate closer to God.

1301
01:32:35,363 --> 01:32:39,402
Some Puccini arias, for example, when you listen to them, when you listen

1302
01:32:39,402 --> 01:32:46,913
to the famous aria from La Rondine, or the famous aria from Gianni Schicci,

1303
01:32:47,352 --> 01:32:51,533
I mean, you get the feeling that he was getting sat dictated by God.

1304
01:32:52,703 --> 01:32:54,123
How can you put that into words?

1305
01:32:54,123 --> 01:32:54,783
You can't.

1306
01:32:55,293 --> 01:32:56,353
There's no way you do that.

1307
01:32:56,653 --> 01:33:02,873
I mean, those moments where we humans have are that we have the privilege,

1308
01:33:03,683 --> 01:33:05,013
I say it as human beings, right?

1309
01:33:05,493 --> 01:33:09,233
Because I mean, I'm speaking from that perspective, okay?

1310
01:33:10,363 --> 01:33:13,343
I say this only as an admirer.

1311
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:19,122
Some human beings have the ability to vibrate so close to God that you can't

1312
01:33:19,132 --> 01:33:22,083
describe it, you can only enjoy it.

1313
01:33:23,962 --> 01:33:29,663
This is why in Judaism, they don't use the name of God, of the creator,

1314
01:33:31,853 --> 01:33:34,463
because how could you put in words something like that?

1315
01:33:35,098 --> 01:33:41,568
And I believe those are times when us humans connect closer to

1316
01:33:41,568 --> 01:33:43,958
the Creator and create things.

1317
01:33:44,898 --> 01:33:45,827
Unique things.

1318
01:33:45,827 --> 01:33:47,017
You cannot describe them.

1319
01:33:47,018 --> 01:33:48,768
There are no words to describe that.

1320
01:33:49,068 --> 01:33:54,337
The only thing you can do is enjoy it and be thankful that you can witness it.

1321
01:33:56,027 --> 01:33:59,778
You were a great footballer yourself in your youth.

1322
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:01,238
You were a goalkeeper.

1323
01:34:01,658 --> 01:34:04,158
Many people would say that's the toughest and the most

1324
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:05,518
important position in football.

1325
01:34:06,288 --> 01:34:09,237
Maybe you could speak about that experience and in general, what's

1326
01:34:09,237 --> 01:34:10,998
harder, being a goalkeeper or president?

1327
01:34:13,017 --> 01:34:14,387
Lovely question.

1328
01:34:15,867 --> 01:34:21,287
Well, indeed, I used to be a goalkeeper, but I'm not so sure

1329
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:22,758
about whether I was any good.

1330
01:34:24,227 --> 01:34:31,718
But, uh, but, you know, the experience of having been a goalkeeper is very valuable.

1331
01:34:34,408 --> 01:34:38,198
First, the goalkeeper is the only player that can use their hands.

1332
01:34:39,363 --> 01:34:42,883
In a certain sector of the pitch in the area.

1333
01:34:46,603 --> 01:34:51,103
The other thing is that, uh, he's also the only player who dresses differently.

1334
01:34:51,103 --> 01:34:51,603
Right?

1335
01:34:53,643 --> 01:34:57,272
Moreover, their training is a solitary one

1336
01:35:00,112 --> 01:35:02,032
and the most important,

1337
01:35:04,622 --> 01:35:09,408
I mean, It is the very climax, the goal, right?

1338
01:35:10,918 --> 01:35:14,338
When the goal is called by their team, everyone is celebrating on the other

1339
01:35:14,338 --> 01:35:16,127
side and the goalkeeper is on his own.

1340
01:35:18,518 --> 01:35:25,418
And, and at the same time, he is the one who suffers the most when a goal is

1341
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:27,868
scored because he gets the direct impact.

1342
01:35:28,297 --> 01:35:32,468
In fact, when the goalkeeper makes a mistake, it's an own goal.

1343
01:35:34,268 --> 01:35:37,888
Imagine a teammate scores a wonderful goal like the one Maradona did.

1344
01:35:38,278 --> 01:35:39,388
It's marvelous.

1345
01:35:39,488 --> 01:35:40,848
And that's just one goal.

1346
01:35:41,618 --> 01:35:45,658
And imagine the goalkeeper picks up the ball and then if they bring it into

1347
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:48,698
the area wrongly, it's like two goals.

1348
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:50,327
It's a complete lack of proportion.

1349
01:35:51,108 --> 01:35:59,328
So therefore, and this, in my opinion, makes goalkeepers have

1350
01:35:59,338 --> 01:36:02,448
a very strong temperament, right?

1351
01:36:03,578 --> 01:36:08,208
They are used to being alone and power is precisely that.

1352
01:36:09,268 --> 01:36:12,208
Because when you make decisions, you are on your own.

1353
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:22,993
And, uh, And not just that, but also when you have a responsibility, like that of

1354
01:36:23,013 --> 01:36:27,832
a president, when you make a decision, it has an impact on millions of people.

1355
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:34,232
So just like goalkeepers, if you make a mistake and score an own goal,

1356
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:40,572
and in this context, it's negative consequences for millions of people.

1357
01:36:42,153 --> 01:36:46,373
Therefore, that has been part of the university of life that has given

1358
01:36:46,373 --> 01:36:49,543
me the tools to be president today.

1359
01:36:49,543 --> 01:36:54,153
That is my training in economics, my training in liberalism, having

1360
01:36:54,153 --> 01:36:58,293
been a goalkeeper and also having had a very tough childhood.

1361
01:36:59,203 --> 01:37:00,173
How hard is it?

1362
01:37:00,583 --> 01:37:05,952
What's been the personal toll of carrying the hope of a nation on your shoulders?

1363
01:37:07,642 --> 01:37:11,523
Well, you know, being defamed, insulted and attacked every single day.

1364
01:37:16,598 --> 01:37:23,158
but again, uh, there's no point in life if it's not with freedom, so like

1365
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:28,608
Sylvester Stallone once said, the secret to life is to carry on in spite of the

1366
01:37:28,608 --> 01:37:31,158
blows you get, the punches you take.

1367
01:37:32,508 --> 01:37:37,808
And fortunately, we have been able to carry on in spite of the

1368
01:37:37,808 --> 01:37:41,828
blows, both coming at us from in front and from behind our backs.

1369
01:37:42,848 --> 01:37:45,738
Because it'd have been more honest if we had been attacked directly.

1370
01:37:46,618 --> 01:37:53,868
But, well, you know, in Argentina, uh, politics and the mass media, they

1371
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:56,208
do love to attack behind your back.

1372
01:37:57,168 --> 01:37:59,668
What role has God played in your life?

1373
01:38:00,858 --> 01:38:01,857
And who is God?

1374
01:38:04,117 --> 01:38:07,007
Well, faith, I'd say, has been

1375
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:12,288
a very fundamental element, you know?

1376
01:38:14,898 --> 01:38:21,898
And, uh, Especially in recent times, during which I've become

1377
01:38:21,918 --> 01:38:27,968
actively involved, particularly in the teachings of Judaism and in,

1378
01:38:28,428 --> 01:38:30,698
in the study of, uh, of the Torah.

1379
01:38:32,758 --> 01:38:41,648
Uh, this has given me a huge, let's say, a huge background to face the many

1380
01:38:41,648 --> 01:38:46,288
adversities which I've encountered and had to overcome in the last few years.

1381
01:38:46,953 --> 01:38:52,963
And as to who God is, he's the creator, the maker, I call him the one.

1382
01:38:54,183 --> 01:38:57,093
What is a better guide for humanity, the invisible hand of

1383
01:38:57,093 --> 01:38:59,382
the market or the hand of God?

1384
01:39:00,293 --> 01:39:01,973
They're perfectly in sync.

1385
01:39:02,273 --> 01:39:03,027
Ha ha ha.

1386
01:39:03,108 --> 01:39:09,318
Again, going back to your youth, uh, you were a lead singer in a rock band.

1387
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:12,078
Who is the greatest rock star of all time?

1388
01:39:12,778 --> 01:39:20,628
Okay, well the way I see it, the most amazing rock singer in history of

1389
01:39:20,628 --> 01:39:22,937
mankind was definitely Elvis Presley.

1390
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:27,997
And my favorite band is the Rolling Stones.

1391
01:39:29,388 --> 01:39:33,338
So I also greatly admire Mick Jagger, you know.

1392
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:37,793
And I still have this dream of getting to meet him in person.

1393
01:39:38,463 --> 01:39:42,033
How fun would it be to play together with the, with the Stones?

1394
01:39:45,213 --> 01:39:46,743
That would be a big, big dream.

1395
01:39:48,003 --> 01:39:54,073
Uh, don't get my hopes up because I set goals and then I go and achieve them.

1396
01:39:55,113 --> 01:39:57,903
Well, I'm close friends with a band that opens for the Stones.

1397
01:39:57,913 --> 01:40:00,113
So I would love to see this happen.

1398
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:01,633
Oh, well, that would be great.

1399
01:40:03,353 --> 01:40:06,723
Or we could also watch the whole concert from the stage.

1400
01:40:08,283 --> 01:40:11,313
I mean, I can't keep ruining the Rolling Stones music.

1401
01:40:11,693 --> 01:40:15,683
I already had a tribute band and did quite a lot of damage to their music.

1402
01:40:16,113 --> 01:40:20,773
Uh, how much of your rock star roots define your approach to politics, to life?

1403
01:40:22,063 --> 01:40:24,923
Do you see yourself as a kind of showman, in part?

1404
01:40:25,413 --> 01:40:26,223
Of course.

1405
01:40:28,293 --> 01:40:29,133
Absolutely.

1406
01:40:29,142 --> 01:40:36,208
My idea is that when you attend, uh, when you attend one of our events, It feels

1407
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:38,158
like going to a Rolling Stones concert.

1408
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:44,488
In fact, in one of my most recent performances at Luna Park, I

1409
01:40:44,488 --> 01:40:47,978
even had the pleasure of singing in front of 10, 000 people.

1410
01:40:50,128 --> 01:40:50,988
It's on YouTube.

1411
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:53,367
No, sorry, not on YouTube.

1412
01:40:54,428 --> 01:40:55,777
It's on my Instagram feed.

1413
01:40:57,558 --> 01:41:04,143
At that event, I sang a song called Panic Show and the song starts by saying "Hi everybody.

1414
01:41:04,883 --> 01:41:05,953
I am the lion."

1415
01:41:06,833 --> 01:41:10,653
Your intensity and passion have earned you the nickname "El Loco"

1416
01:41:10,943 --> 01:41:11,683
The madman.

1417
01:41:13,413 --> 01:41:18,193
Do you think some madness is necessary to challenge the powerful establishment?

1418
01:41:19,203 --> 01:41:22,082
Well, maybe it's a matter of perspective, right?

1419
01:41:22,332 --> 01:41:23,873
It could be the other way around.

1420
01:41:24,653 --> 01:41:29,823
That everyone else is crazy by living in a way contrary to the ideas of freedom.

1421
01:41:30,638 --> 01:41:35,518
And so maybe the same person who wants to fix that is then considered a madman.

1422
01:41:36,528 --> 01:41:40,408
Anyway, the nickname doesn't bother me at all.

1423
01:41:41,088 --> 01:41:44,937
In fact, I even enjoy it because I've been called like that since I was 10 years old.

1424
01:41:44,937 --> 01:41:51,127
So it's not something that particularly bothers me, you know, because, uh,

1425
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:57,538
it's a nickname that, well, it's, uh, it has been used for many years.

1426
01:41:57,538 --> 01:42:04,238
But actually, if I present to you the case of San Martin, when he said he was

1427
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:05,918
going to cross the Andes to liberate.

1428
01:42:06,798 --> 01:42:11,418
Not only Argentina, not only our country, but also Chile and Peru.

1429
01:42:11,748 --> 01:42:13,398
And people called him crazy.

1430
01:42:13,848 --> 01:42:19,798
Imagine if you had tried and spoken with, I don't know, with Michelangelo,

1431
01:42:20,038 --> 01:42:22,008
you would have called him crazy too.

1432
01:42:22,648 --> 01:42:28,828
Or if you had talked to, I don't know, hundreds of people who have changed the

1433
01:42:28,828 --> 01:42:33,128
world, surely they would have thought that Einstein was crazy and so on.

1434
01:42:33,128 --> 01:42:34,438
The list would be infinite.

1435
01:42:34,868 --> 01:42:43,068
So, What is the difference between a madman and a genius? Success.

1436
01:42:45,978 --> 01:42:47,298
Let me ask you about the market.

1437
01:42:48,288 --> 01:42:53,948
It's so interesting from your view of the world, how powerful the market is

1438
01:42:53,948 --> 01:42:56,688
at figuring out what's best for society.

1439
01:42:57,048 --> 01:43:01,538
Why do you think the market works so well as a guide for humanity?

1440
01:43:03,688 --> 01:43:06,638
One must first understand what the market is.

1441
01:43:08,527 --> 01:43:13,197
Simply put, the market is a process of voluntary exchange where

1442
01:43:13,197 --> 01:43:18,467
individuals cooperate through the transfer of property rights in

1443
01:43:18,467 --> 01:43:22,163
which private property is upheld.

1444
01:43:22,993 --> 01:43:28,033
This is the system that drives the allocation of resources.

1445
01:43:28,803 --> 01:43:33,683
In essence, socialism, and this is what Mises condemns in his book, Socialism,

1446
01:43:34,653 --> 01:43:41,412
shows is that, uh, without private property, prices cease to exist and

1447
01:43:41,413 --> 01:43:42,952
therefore resources are diverted.

1448
01:43:43,452 --> 01:43:46,112
Why don't you think it's the same to make a road of asphalt or gold?

1449
01:43:46,573 --> 01:43:47,753
Why not make it of gold?

1450
01:43:48,303 --> 01:43:51,473
Because you have an understanding of economic calculation.

1451
01:43:51,473 --> 01:43:53,693
You have an idea of prices in your mind.

1452
01:43:54,093 --> 01:44:00,433
So in this context, if there is no private property, there are no prices.

1453
01:44:00,823 --> 01:44:06,658
And as a result, the free market capitalism, you know, It's the

1454
01:44:06,668 --> 01:44:12,328
best mechanism ever developed by humankind for resource allocation.

1455
01:44:13,088 --> 01:44:17,608
This also implies that markets must be free, free from state

1456
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:23,303
intervention, because when the state intervenes, It creates interference.

1457
01:44:23,953 --> 01:44:30,433
And, uh, markets need to allow free entry and exit, what we call competition.

1458
01:44:31,053 --> 01:44:35,802
However, it's better to understand competition in the sense described by

1459
01:44:35,823 --> 01:44:39,912
Israel Gerstner, one of the foremost figures of the Austrian school, or

1460
01:44:39,912 --> 01:44:44,593
in the neoclassical framework as William Baumol understood it, which

1461
01:44:44,593 --> 01:44:49,283
was the concept of free entry and exit in so called contestable markets.

1462
01:44:49,778 --> 01:44:53,748
And also, let's talk about what pertains to the division of

1463
01:44:53,748 --> 01:44:55,688
labor and social cooperation.

1464
01:44:56,248 --> 01:45:01,627
You know, the most wonderful thing about capitalism is that you can only

1465
01:45:01,628 --> 01:45:06,248
be successful by serving others with better quality goods at a better price.

1466
01:45:06,977 --> 01:45:11,728
If you are successful, In the free market capitalism, you are a hero.

1467
01:45:11,868 --> 01:45:13,178
You are a social benefactor.

1468
01:45:13,478 --> 01:45:14,878
You are a prosperity machine.

1469
01:45:15,398 --> 01:45:23,928
So the better you do, you know, the better you do, the better it is for society.

1470
01:45:24,458 --> 01:45:25,398
This is very important.

1471
01:45:25,398 --> 01:45:29,457
I remember when I had my first meeting with Elon Musk and this

1472
01:45:29,458 --> 01:45:32,128
made me admire him greatly.

1473
01:45:33,268 --> 01:45:35,768
And this is something my sister commented on too.

1474
01:45:36,628 --> 01:45:40,448
You know, Elon Musk told me something he does every day.

1475
01:45:40,698 --> 01:45:42,888
He wakes up every morning thinking about

1476
01:45:44,513 --> 01:45:47,773
what problem he could fix for humanity.

1477
01:45:48,703 --> 01:45:49,883
That's amazing.

1478
01:45:50,993 --> 01:45:54,073
Of course, what is the counterpart being successful?

1479
01:45:55,173 --> 01:46:03,362
Therefore, in that sense, and moreover, in my view on how the

1480
01:46:03,362 --> 01:46:08,313
system works on how the market works, market failures do not exist.

1481
01:46:08,953 --> 01:46:11,193
That is to say, that is a problem.

1482
01:46:12,793 --> 01:46:13,293
Alright?

1483
01:46:13,483 --> 01:46:15,983
A problem for neoclassical economies.

1484
01:46:16,783 --> 01:46:23,553
because of, of the mathematical tools they've used, uh, to develop

1485
01:46:23,583 --> 01:46:29,163
economic analysis, but actually it's not a real issue in everyday life.

1486
01:46:29,493 --> 01:46:31,923
It's a problem in the minds of economists.

1487
01:46:32,123 --> 01:46:37,423
In fact, my latest book called Capitalism, Socialism, and the Neoclassical Trap

1488
01:46:37,423 --> 01:46:39,643
deals precisely with this issue.

1489
01:46:40,203 --> 01:46:42,833
Yeah, you've outlined these ideas in Capitalism, Socialism,

1490
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:44,363
and then Neoclassical Trap.

1491
01:46:44,683 --> 01:46:45,583
So the trap.

1492
01:46:46,003 --> 01:46:48,943
is that there's no such thing as a middle ground.

1493
01:46:49,023 --> 01:46:52,273
It's either capitalism or socialism, and every middle ground

1494
01:46:52,553 --> 01:46:55,013
ends up in a state of socialism.

1495
01:46:55,363 --> 01:47:02,108
Well, actually, that is what Mises said, that there were, he said that

1496
01:47:02,118 --> 01:47:06,868
there are only two systems, free enterprise capitalism and socialism.

1497
01:47:07,878 --> 01:47:12,937
And he also pointed out, and this is proven in Hayek's book, The Road to

1498
01:47:12,937 --> 01:47:17,818
Serfdom, that any middle ground solution is unstable in terms of capitalism,

1499
01:47:18,177 --> 01:47:20,088
meaning it tends towards socialism.

1500
01:47:20,498 --> 01:47:24,838
So, when you implement an intervention, it causes government failure, which

1501
01:47:24,838 --> 01:47:28,588
then triggers further intervention, setting up a trap that results

1502
01:47:28,588 --> 01:47:30,017
in more and more intervention.

1503
01:47:30,508 --> 01:47:34,968
And in this context, the neoclassicals, with their market failure theory,

1504
01:47:35,227 --> 01:47:38,997
are in fact dealing with problems that are fundamentally mathematical.

1505
01:47:40,588 --> 01:47:44,248
Rather than making the world a better place, they have, if you

1506
01:47:44,248 --> 01:47:47,438
will, been instrumental in increasing the levels of intervention.

1507
01:47:47,963 --> 01:47:49,153
Let me tell you something.

1508
01:47:51,743 --> 01:47:57,913
Well, you know, I have an economist as chairman of the

1509
01:47:57,943 --> 01:48:02,343
president's advisory council,

1510
01:48:02,353 --> 01:48:07,222
Dr. Damien Riedel, who studied here at Harvard university and completed

1511
01:48:07,223 --> 01:48:12,983
his PhD, was mentored by Kenneth Rogoff, the American economist.

1512
01:48:13,653 --> 01:48:15,523
And Rogoff has said that

1513
01:48:15,533 --> 01:48:18,903
Dr. Riedel was his best student.

1514
01:48:20,943 --> 01:48:23,923
Nowadays, we're actually working with

1515
01:48:23,933 --> 01:48:25,412
Dr. Riedel specifically on

1516
01:48:26,668 --> 01:48:33,408
on all these issues that, that arise from, you know, the interventions

1517
01:48:33,428 --> 01:48:41,787
proposed, uh, proposed by the, by the mainstream, such as the so

1518
01:48:41,788 --> 01:48:43,758
called correction of market failures.

1519
01:48:45,487 --> 01:48:48,757
And a few days ago, he conducted a survey.

1520
01:48:50,038 --> 01:48:56,708
Of search algorithms and, uh, policy recommendations,

1521
01:48:58,878 --> 01:49:01,538
and that resulted in a map painted from red to blue.

1522
01:49:02,188 --> 01:49:09,787
and, well, the redder it was, the more it was linked to socialism.

1523
01:49:10,387 --> 01:49:15,928
There was an intermediate thing that was yellow, and blue was free market ideas.

1524
01:49:16,778 --> 01:49:22,728
And one of the things he discovered as part, as part of that graph or chart,

1525
01:49:23,963 --> 01:49:31,913
was that the largest, the largest number of policy recommendations

1526
01:49:31,983 --> 01:49:36,003
scandalously are actually left leaning.

1527
01:49:37,633 --> 01:49:42,893
So that is the empirical evidence of what I pointed out in the book, Capitalism,

1528
01:49:43,112 --> 01:49:45,322
Socialism and the Neoclassical Trap.

1529
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:48,763
You mentioned your four legged children.

1530
01:49:49,213 --> 01:49:52,763
What have you, uh, learned about life from your dogs?

1531
01:49:53,563 --> 01:49:59,452
Uh, well, from my four legged children, I have learned unconditional love.

1532
01:50:02,352 --> 01:50:03,543
In fact, well,

1533
01:50:07,252 --> 01:50:11,003
my name in Hebrew means loyal friend, faithful friend.

1534
01:50:12,353 --> 01:50:14,512
And on the Chinese horoscope, I am dog.

1535
01:50:15,762 --> 01:50:22,862
And if there's one thing that defines me is loyalty, being decent.

1536
01:50:23,288 --> 01:50:28,208
And those virtues, you know, uh, you can find them in those wonderful beings that

1537
01:50:28,208 --> 01:50:32,148
dogs are who, who love unconditionally.

1538
01:50:33,938 --> 01:50:36,538
In fact, they are superior beings, right?

1539
01:50:37,648 --> 01:50:41,698
Spiritually speaking, in my case, because,

1540
01:50:44,048 --> 01:50:49,018
because, you know, I don't forget or forgive those who have harmed me.

1541
01:50:50,208 --> 01:50:55,003
That is to say, All those who have insulted, defamed me, and criticized me.

1542
01:50:55,673 --> 01:51:02,413
I remember each one of them, but I don't have the greatness needed to forgive them.

1543
01:51:04,213 --> 01:51:08,413
On the topic of loyalty in politics, I'm sure there's been a lot of people,

1544
01:51:08,983 --> 01:51:11,153
some people, who have betrayed you.

1545
01:51:14,622 --> 01:51:15,753
Does that hurt your heart?

1546
01:51:17,692 --> 01:51:18,632
It depends,

1547
01:51:20,993 --> 01:51:22,373
because,

1548
01:51:25,053 --> 01:51:30,123
you sometimes think that you can expect some people to be loyal, and if they

1549
01:51:30,123 --> 01:51:35,053
betray you, of course, that hurts.

1550
01:51:35,958 --> 01:51:40,838
But some people, you actually don't expect anything from them, so, so if there's

1551
01:51:40,858 --> 01:51:47,438
betrayal, I mean, you won't be annoyed or feel bad because, uh, because you owe it

1552
01:51:47,448 --> 01:51:49,497
to someone who didn't share your values.

1553
01:51:50,928 --> 01:51:53,078
But politics does have that, you know?

1554
01:51:54,228 --> 01:52:00,448
Sometimes, many of the people you may come across don't have the values you

1555
01:52:00,448 --> 01:52:04,168
advocate for, but it's cost benefit.

1556
01:52:04,858 --> 01:52:06,908
You need to let the ship sail on, right?

1557
01:52:07,603 --> 01:52:09,183
Or would you rather let it sink?

1558
01:52:10,603 --> 01:52:11,543
That's not my case.

1559
01:52:11,583 --> 01:52:12,793
I fight until the end.

1560
01:52:13,223 --> 01:52:16,783
There are traitors, but that's part of politics.

1561
01:52:18,793 --> 01:52:22,782
And that's not my line, but of course they do exist.

1562
01:52:23,913 --> 01:52:27,833
There are a lot of people who admire your revolutionary spirit.

1563
01:52:28,083 --> 01:52:29,993
What, what advice would you give them?

1564
01:52:30,293 --> 01:52:36,523
Maybe young people on how to live a life like yours and have an impact on

1565
01:52:36,523 --> 01:52:39,003
the world like you have begun to do.

1566
01:52:40,303 --> 01:52:43,243
I didn't do this thinking about having an impact on the world.

1567
01:52:46,903 --> 01:52:51,553
I have defined what makes me happy and I live according to that.

1568
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:53,923
I live consistently by that.

1569
01:52:55,353 --> 01:52:56,163
And,

1570
01:52:58,263 --> 01:53:02,402
and most importantly, I would say never give up.

1571
01:53:03,953 --> 01:53:04,813
Moreover,

1572
01:53:07,562 --> 01:53:09,767
and above all, never be half hearted.

1573
01:53:11,568 --> 01:53:12,548
I would rather

1574
01:53:15,678 --> 01:53:22,748
cry because I failed rather than not crying because I never tried.

1575
01:53:24,167 --> 01:53:30,508
I mean, I'm a perfectionist, so when I do err, of course, I have a bad time.

1576
01:53:31,257 --> 01:53:36,077
But still, I prefer to go and get things done.

1577
01:53:36,688 --> 01:53:38,708
If it goes wrong, it's part of life.

1578
01:53:40,198 --> 01:53:45,968
I will never, never have to regret not having done what I thought

1579
01:53:45,968 --> 01:53:48,148
needed to be done at that moment.

1580
01:53:48,728 --> 01:53:49,228
Alright?

1581
01:53:50,338 --> 01:53:54,948
What gives you hope about the future of Argentina and the future of humanity?

1582
01:53:56,458 --> 01:54:02,978
Well, uh, the fact that thanks to social media and to the whole tech

1583
01:54:03,007 --> 01:54:08,998
revolution going on every day, more and more people are becoming aware.

1584
01:54:11,093 --> 01:54:15,963
Of how important freedom is to live.

1585
01:54:17,013 --> 01:54:19,203
To live in peace and prosperity.

1586
01:54:19,923 --> 01:54:28,093
And I believe even though bureaucrats and the elites fight untiring to enslave us.

1587
01:54:29,993 --> 01:54:33,413
A wave of freedom has been unleashed,

1588
01:54:36,353 --> 01:54:41,293
which if we do wage the fight, we'll have a much better world.

1589
01:54:42,303 --> 01:54:47,392
What does your famous words of, uh, Viva la Libertad, how did that come

1590
01:54:47,392 --> 01:54:49,203
about and what does it mean to you?

1591
01:54:49,583 --> 01:54:51,022
Long live freedom, damn it.

1592
01:54:52,803 --> 01:54:59,233
You know, that first started while I was giving my book presentations.

1593
01:54:59,913 --> 01:55:04,017
At the end of my presentation, I would say, Viva la Libertad, carajo.

1594
01:55:04,978 --> 01:55:08,208
And, um, that really stuck with me since then.

1595
01:55:09,858 --> 01:55:12,628
Without thinking about it, throughout my life, it was

1596
01:55:12,638 --> 01:55:14,518
going to continue being present.

1597
01:55:14,868 --> 01:55:20,697
In fact, today, my presentations, all of my speeches end with,

1598
01:55:21,958 --> 01:55:24,037
May God bless the Argentinians.

1599
01:55:25,068 --> 01:55:29,278
May the forces of heaven be with us, and Viva la Libertad, Carajo.

1600
01:55:31,238 --> 01:55:32,718
The first phrase reflects

1601
01:55:35,398 --> 01:55:42,188
my faith in God fervently, and that I'm deeply thankful to the

1602
01:55:42,188 --> 01:55:46,857
Creator for the wonderful things He has bestowed upon me daily.

1603
01:55:48,223 --> 01:55:52,042
The second one has to do with a quote from the book of Maccabees 3.19

1604
01:55:52,923 --> 01:55:57,163
which says that victory in battle doesn't depend on the size of the

1605
01:55:57,163 --> 01:55:59,243
army, but on the forces of heaven.

1606
01:56:00,233 --> 01:56:06,213
This has to do with the victory of the Jewish people, the Maccabeans against the

1607
01:56:06,213 --> 01:56:09,283
Greeks, and how they recovered the temple.

1608
01:56:11,022 --> 01:56:12,043
And the last one.

1609
01:56:12,543 --> 01:56:14,023
Well, it's my war cry.

1610
01:56:15,403 --> 01:56:17,363
Well, there's no better way to end it.

1611
01:56:17,573 --> 01:56:21,753
Thank you for being a warrior for freedom and thank you for talking today.

1612
01:56:21,983 --> 01:56:26,993
Thank you very much indeed for your interview and thank you for being so well

1613
01:56:26,993 --> 01:56:32,313
educated because very often interviewers are not like that and you did have

1614
01:56:32,313 --> 01:56:36,803
windows to play foul and you didn't and I recognize that and I thank you for that.

1615
01:56:37,348 --> 01:56:37,848
Thank you.

1616
01:56:39,628 --> 01:56:41,878
Thanks for listening to this conversation with Javier Milei

1617
01:56:42,608 --> 01:56:45,848
To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

1618
01:56:46,428 --> 01:56:49,338
And now, let me leave you with some words from George Orwell.

1619
01:56:50,647 --> 01:56:55,448
"In a time of deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."

1620
01:56:56,978 --> 01:57:00,178
Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
