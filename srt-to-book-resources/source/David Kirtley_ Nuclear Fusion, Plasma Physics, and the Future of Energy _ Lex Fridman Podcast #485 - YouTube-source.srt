00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,810
- The following is a conversation with David Kirtley, a nuclear

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,670
engineer, expert on nuclear fusion, and the CEO of

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,560
Helion Energy, a company working on building nuclear fusion

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,280
reactors and have made incredible progress in a short period of time

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,660
that make it seem possible, like we could actually get there

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,260
as a civilization. This is exciting because nuclear

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,080
fusion, if achieved commercially, will solve most of our energy

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,140
needs in a clean, safe way, providing virtually unlimited clean

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,900
electricity. The problem is that fusion is incredibly

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,750
difficult to achieve. You need to heat hydrogen to over 100

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,580
million degrees Celsius and contain it long enough for

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,020
atoms to fuse. That's why the joke in the past has been

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,480
that fusion is 30 years away and always will

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,400
be. Just in case you're not familiar, let me

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,980
clarify the difference between nuclear fusion and nuclear

16
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,780
fission. By the way, I believe according to the excellent subreddit post by

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,820
pmgoodbeer on this, the preferred pronunciation

18
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,060
of the latter in the US is nuclear fission, like

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,980
vision. And in the UK and other countries is nuclear fission, like

20
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,960
mission. I prefer the nuclear fission pronunciation because

21
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,720
America. So today's nuclear power plants

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
use nuclear fission. They split apart heavy

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,720
uranium atoms to release energy. Fusion does the opposite. It

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,600
combines light hydrogen atoms together, the same reaction that

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,420
powers the Sun and the stars. The result is that

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,200
it's clean fuel from water, no long-lived radioactive waste,

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,110
inherently safe because a fusion reactor can't melt down. If

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,910
something goes wrong, the reactor simply stops. And there's

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,940
no carbon emissions. On a more technical side,

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,460
Helion uses a different approach to fusion than has

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,660
traditionally been done. Most fusion efforts have used

32
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,269
tokamaks, which are these giant donut-shaped magnetic containment

33
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,400
chambers. Helion uses pulsed magnetoinertial

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,049
fusion. David gets into the super technical

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,030
physics and engineering details in this episode, which was

36
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,280
fun and fascinating. I think it's important to

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,040
remember that for all of human history, we've been

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,540
limited by energy scarcity. And every major leap in

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,360
civilization, agriculture, industrialization, information

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,400
age, came in part from unlocking new energy

41
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,400
sources. If someone is able to solve commercial

42
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,340
fusion, we would enter a new era of energy abundance that

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,420
fundamentally changes what's possible for us humans. I'm excited for the

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,880
future, and I'm excited for super technical physics podcast episodes.

45
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,660
This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the

46

description where you can also find links to contact me, ask

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,180
questions, give feedback, and so on. And now, dear

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,180
friends, here's David Kirtley. Let's start with the big picture. What is nuclear

49
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,860
fusion, and maybe what is nuclear fission? Let's lay out the basics.

50
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,640
- So fusion is what powers the universe. Fusion is what happens in

51
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,660
stars and it's where the vast amount of energy

52
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,570
that we use today here on Earth comes from the process of

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,420
fusion. It also is what powers plants. And those

54
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,950
plants become oil, and those become fossil fuels that

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,940
then powers the rest of human civilization for

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:53,490
the last 100 years. And so fusion really underpins a lot of what has enabled us as

57
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,480
humans to go forward. However, ironically, we

58
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,140
don't do it actively here on Earth to make electricity

59
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,549
yet. And so fundamentally, what fusion is, is

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,500
taking the most common elements in the universe: hydrogen and lightweight

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,460
isotopes of hydrogen and helium, and fusing those together to

62
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,960
make heavier elements. In that process, as you

63
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,920
combine atomic nuclei and form heavier nuclei, those

64
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,220
nuclei are slightly lighter than the sum of the

65
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,990
parts. And that comes from a lot of the details of quantum mechanics

66
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,140
and how those fundamental particles combine and interact.

67
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,880
We also talk about the strong nuclear force that holds the

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,480
atomic nuclei together as one of the fundamental forces involved in

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,900
fusion. But that mass defect, E=MC², we know from Einstein, is also

70
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,770
energy. And so, in that process, a tremendous amount of energy is

71
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,810
released. And the actual reactions, I think, is a lot more interesting than simply it's a

72
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,630
little bit lighter, and therefore, energy is released. But that's the fundamental

73
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,300
process in fusion as you're bringing those lightweight atomic

74
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,960
nuclei, those isotopes together. Fission is the exact

75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,940
opposite, where you're taking the heaviest elements in the universe:

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,720
uranium, plutonium, things that are so heavy and have so

77
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,660
many internal protons and neutrons and electrons, that they're

78
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,800
barely held together at all. They're fundamentally unstable or

79
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,660
radioactive, and those elements are very close to falling

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,040
apart. And as they do that, if you take a uranium

81
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,820
235 or a plutonium 239 nucleus, and you add

82
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,600
something new, usually it's a neutron, a sub-atomic particle that's

83
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,560
uncharged, that unstable, that very large nuclei will then break

84
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,340
into pieces. Many pieces, a whole spectrum of pieces. But if you add up all of those

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,120
pieces, they also have slightly less mass than the

86
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,969
initial one did, the initial uranium or plutonium. And in that

87
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,740
process, again, E=MC², a tremendous amount of energy is

88
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,400
released. There's a very famous curve in atomic

89
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,400
physics, fusion or fission, looking at the periodic table. Going from the

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,460
lightest elements, hydrogen, to the heaviest elements, those uranium, plutonium,

91
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,240
and others. And fusion happens up to iron. Iron is the

92
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,910
magical point in between where lighter elements than

93
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,948
iron fuse together, and heavier elements fission

94
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:19,808
or are fissile and break apart and release energy.

95
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:24,388
I think about and I look at that process in

96
00:06:24,548 --> 00:06:28,268
stars, in that our star is fundamentally an early stage

97
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,027
star that's burning just hydrogens. But when it burns and does

98
00:06:32,068 --> 00:06:35,787
fusion, those hydrogens combine into heliums, and

99
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:39,768
later stage stars can then burn those heliums and they can fuse those

100
00:06:39,808 --> 00:06:43,607
together to form even heavier elements and carbons. And those carbons can fuse

101
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:47,217
together and form heavier elements. And that

102
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:50,928
whole stellar process is something that inspires us at Helion

103
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:54,527
to think about what are fusion fuels, not just the

104
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:59,168
simplest ones, but more advanced fusion fuels that we see in stars throughout the

105
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:02,868
- Okay, so there's a million things I want to say. First, zooming out to the biggest possible

106
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,998
picture, if you look across hundreds of millions, billions of

107
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:09,647
years, and all the, my opinion, alien

108
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:13,188
civilizations that are out there, they're going to be powered

109
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:17,227
likely by fusion. So our advanced intelligent civilization is powered by fusion in that

110
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:22,038
the sun is our power plant.

111
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:26,688
Then the other thing is the physics. Again, very basic, but you said E equals MC squared

112
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:30,847
a couple times. Can you explain this equation?

113
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:34,668
- E=MC squared is a fundamental relationship that a patent clerk, Einstein, discovered and unlocked

114
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:41,868
an entire new realm of physics and engineering and has shown us

115
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,967
engineering and has shown us

116
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:49,107
atomic physics, what happens inside the nucleus, and unlocked our understanding of the universe

117
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:52,727
and paved the way for many of the physics advancements that came after.

118
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:59,768
That we think about mass as these particles. But in reality, at the same time, they're energy,

119
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:07,008
and there's a direct quantitative relationship between how much energy is in all of that mass.

120
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:10,987
And in fact, all of the energy that is released, even by atomic physics, certainly in atomic

121
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:18,668
reactions, is E=MC squared. I think most people have heard of and are used to this.

122
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:22,388
But also in chemistry and in chemical bonds, there is a change in mass. When you take a

123
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:26,448
those chemical bonds, there is a change in mass. When you take a

124
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:30,376
hydrogen and an oxygen and you burn them and you combine them into water, there's a change in mass.

125
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:34,107
Now, that change per atom and per molecule is actually so small that it's extremely hard to

126
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:37,147
molecule is actually so small that it's extremely hard to

127
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:41,008
measure, but it's still there. That's the energy that is released, and you can quantify that.

128
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:44,887
We use units of electron volts as a unit of what is the energy in atomic processes or chemical

129
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:53,028
processes.

130
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:57,038
- Can you also just speak to the different fuels that you mentioned, both on the fusion and

131
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,038
fission side?

132
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:04,088
...fission side? So uranium, plutonium for the fission, and then hydrogen isotopes for the fusion?

133
00:09:04,668 --> 00:09:08,488
- So for fission, uranium and plutonium, we don't make those nuclei. Those, right now for humanity,

134
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,468
make those nuclei. Those, right now, for humanity,

135
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:16,387
those have been made in the primordial universe through super-supernova and Big Bang

136
00:09:16,428 --> 00:09:24,088
and the initial formation of the universe where matter was created. And so we dig those up.

137
00:09:24,168 --> 00:09:27,828
We dig up uranium, plutonium out of the ground. And in fact, most plutonium we make from

138
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:31,598
uranium, and we can talk about how to enrich uranium if we want to go down that road.

139
00:09:31,598 --> 00:09:38,608
But that's how we get those molecules and nuclei. For fusion materials, hydrogenic species, or

140
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:42,588
hydrogens are primordial in the universe. Also, only the most common things that are in

141
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:46,588
primordial in the universe. Also only the most common things

142
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,588
the universe. The suns and stars are made up of hydrogens and heliums, and so the vast

143
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:57,248
majority of atoms in the universe still are hydrogen.

144
00:09:57,288 --> 00:10:01,208
- So the basic fuel for fission is already in the ground, and then the basic fuel

145
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:02,848
for fusion is everywhere.

146
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:06,568
- Is everywhere, and we particularly use a type of hydrogen

147
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:10,588
called deuterium, which is a heavier isotope

148
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,828
of hydrogen. Hydrogen is typically one proton and one

149
00:10:13,867 --> 00:10:17,508
electron, atomic mass of one. Deuterium is an atomic mass of

150
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:21,488
two, which is a proton, which is a charged particle, and it has a neutron in

151
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:25,488
its nucleus, which is an uncharged particle. And so that's deuterium.

152
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:29,387
As the fuel now, deuterium is also found in all water on Earth, in the

153
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:36,906
water I'm drinking right now. It's in my body. It's in Coca-Cola. It's everywhere.

154
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:40,928
And it's safe and clean and one of those fundamental particles that was

155
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:44,768
born in the cosmos, and we estimate that in

156
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:48,488
seawater here on Earth, we have, if we powered at our current

157
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:52,568
use of electricity, all of humanity on fusion,

158
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:56,088
somewhere between 100 million years and a billion years of

159
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:59,988
fuel in hydrogen and deuterium here on Earth.

160
00:11:00,068 --> 00:11:02,288
- And how is that stored mostly?

161
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,248
- Mostly that's just in water. Mostly it's a mix of, we

162
00:11:06,268 --> 00:11:10,188
call this actually heavy water, where you have normal water that you're

163
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:14,127
used to. We talk about and you learn in school, is H2O, where

164
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:17,708
there's two hydrogens and oxygen in a nucleus in the

165
00:11:17,748 --> 00:11:20,748
molecule. And deuterium, or heavy water, is

166
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,728
D2O, two deuteriums and an oxygen. In reality,

167
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:27,548
it's actually an interesting mix where you have some

168
00:11:27,768 --> 00:12:14,748
HDO, so a mix of hydrogen and deuterium. You also have other hydrogen

169
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:15,958
but also in chemistry and in chemical bonds, that in those chemical bonds, there is a change in mass.

170
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,032
- ...fission side? So uranium, plutonium for the fission, and then hydrogen isotopes for the fusion? In terms of fuel, is that correct to say?

171
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,022
- That's correct to say at today's power level. I think what's interesting is

172
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:26,992
the idea that as we deploy the same power source that powers the

173
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:30,222
universe here on Earth as humans, can we do

174
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:34,152
more? Can we have access to much more electricity, and much more

175
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,712
energy and do really interesting things with that? And still there's

176
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:41,912
large amounts, millions and millions of years of power even at

177
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:45,052
much higher output power levels for humanity.

178
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,992
- Yeah, so the moment we start running out of

179
00:12:48,712 --> 00:12:52,272
hydrogen and helium, that means we're doing some pretty incredible

180
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:56,262
things with our technology. And then that technology is

181
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:59,932
probably going to allow us to propagate out into the universe and then discover other sources.

182
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,312
Because you can also get it on other planets.

183
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:06,262
Whatever planets have water, it looks more and more likely like a lot of

184
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:12,892
them do. What an incredible future, just out into the cosmos, nuclear power plants

185
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:18,632
everywhere. Okay, so to linger on some of the technical stuff, you said

186
00:13:18,652 --> 00:13:22,272
strong nuclear force. So how exactly is the energy

187
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:30,972
created? So how does the E=MC squared, the M go to the E infusion?

188
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:34,692
- So in fusion, you take these lightweight isotopes like

189
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:38,582
hydrogen and deuterium, and as you combine them and get them

190
00:13:38,612 --> 00:13:42,202
closer and closer together, some really interesting fundamental physics happens.

191
00:13:42,232 --> 00:13:46,102
So first these atomic nuclei are charged. They have an electric

192
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:49,412
these atomic nuclei are charged. They have an electric

193
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:53,452
charge, and they like charges repel. And I think everybody is

194
00:13:53,492 --> 00:13:57,232
familiar with that, where you take two positive charges, and you try to push them

195
00:13:57,272 --> 00:14:01,192
together, and the electromagnetic force between them repels them. So

196
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:05,082
you have a force that's actually pushing against them. So in fusion,

197
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:08,992
you work to get your fuel very hot, very, very high temperatures, 100

198
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:12,872
million degree temperatures. And temperature really is kinetic energy. It's

199
00:14:13,012 --> 00:14:16,252
motion, it's velocity. So that these particles are moving so

200
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:20,132
fast that even though they're coming together and there's this repulsive

201
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:24,102
electromagnetic force, they can still come close enough that another force comes into

202
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:27,492
play, which is the strong force. And then once you get

203
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:31,272
within a very close distance on the order of the scale of

204
00:14:31,312 --> 00:14:35,212
those nuclei themselves, of those atomic nuclei. So the tiniest thing you could

205
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,952
imagine, and probably way smaller than that, these particles then are

206
00:14:38,972 --> 00:14:42,252
attracted to each other and they combine and they fuse

207
00:14:42,472 --> 00:14:46,392
together. At that point, you create heavier atomic nuclei that have a

208
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:50,712
slightly less mass, slightly less total mass in the system,

209
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:55,112
and that mass equals MC squared as energy.

210
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,912
- So extremely high temperature, extremely high

211
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:01,932
speed. Maybe that's one of the other differences also with fusion

212
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:05,792
and fission, is just the amount of temperature required for the

213
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,632
reactions. Is that accurate to say?

214
00:15:07,712 --> 00:15:11,652
- Yeah, and I think fundamentally it's that in a lot of ways,

215
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:14,381
fusion is hard and fission is easy.

216
00:15:14,572 --> 00:15:18,432
Nuclear fission happens at room temperature, that this uranium

217
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:22,381
and plutonium is so likely to break apart already that

218
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:25,852
simply the adding of one of these neutrons, one extra

219
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:29,292
particle will then break it apart and release energy.

220
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,612
And if you have a lot of them together, it will create a chain

221
00:15:32,652 --> 00:15:36,452
reaction. Fusion, that doesn't happen at all. Fusion is actually

222
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:40,872
really hard to do. You have to overcome those electromagnetic forces to have a

223
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:44,912
single fusion reaction happen. And so it takes things like in our sun

224
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:48,452
we have what is called gravitational confinement, where the

225
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:51,952
gravity, literally the mass of the fuel itself is

226
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:55,672
pulling to the center of the sun and it's pulling. And so there's a

227
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:59,682
large force that's pulling all that fuel together and holding it

228
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:03,622
and confining it together such that it gets close enough and

229
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:07,292
hot enough for long enough that fusion happens.

230
00:16:07,312 --> 00:16:11,192
- And then we have to figure out if we're building fusion reactors, we have to

231
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:18,422
figure out how to do that confinement without the huge size gravity of the sun.

232
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:22,422
- That's right. Obviously, the sun is vastly larger than Earth, and

233
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:25,582
so we can't do that same process here on Earth.

234
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,302
- Yet. No, I'm just kidding. All right.

235
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:31,292
- But we have other forces we get to use. We can use the electromagnetic force,

236
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:35,132
which the sun doesn't get to do, to apply those forces.

237
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:39,102
And I actually want to take a pause right there and point out a word.

238
00:16:39,152 --> 00:16:42,852
Historically, we've used the word reactor around fusion, but I don't think that's

239
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:47,422
right. And for me, we're really careful about this terminology.

240
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:51,392
When we look to how that word is defined, and we can look

241
00:16:51,452 --> 00:16:55,412
to how the experts define it, it doesn't really apply to fusion.

242
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:59,152
So the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the NRC, defines

243
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:02,682
reactor as, I have it right here, "A nuclear

244
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:06,112
reactor is an apparatus other than an atomic weapon,

245
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:09,452
designed or used to sustain nuclear fission in a

246
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:13,332
self-supporting chain reaction." And there's two big parts to

247
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:17,290
that. That one, fission reaction. Obviously,

248
00:17:17,352 --> 00:17:21,031
fusion is not that, and we've talked about why, but also the self-sustaining

249
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:25,051
part. In that a reactor is self-sustaining, you take

250
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:28,311
your hands off of it and it keeps going. In fusion, that doesn't

251
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:32,212
happen. And we know because we have to do it every day and it's really

252
00:17:32,232 --> 00:17:36,012
hard to do. And so we actually use the word generator, because

253
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:39,992
we don't talk about, for instance, a natural gas reactor, is that if you

254
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:43,332
stop putting in fuel, it turns off. And the same thing happens in

255
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:47,212
fusion. And so we're pretty careful about making sure

256
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:50,992
we talk about that as a generator where you're putting in fuel, you're getting

257
00:17:51,032 --> 00:17:54,912
electricity out. And then when you stop putting in fuel, it just

258
00:17:54,932 --> 00:17:58,752
shuts off. And you can go even one step further and say, "What am I going to do with

259
00:17:58,772 --> 00:18:02,752
this fusion that powers the universe? And what does humanity want out of this?"

260
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:06,312
And what we want is electricity. We don't simply want a set of

261
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:10,322
reactions or even heat and energy. That's great, but what

262
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,352
I really want is electricity.

263
00:18:12,412 --> 00:18:16,322
- And yeah, we'll talk about the technical details of one of the big benefits of

264
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:20,122
the linear design of the approach that you do is you get to electricity

265
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:24,032
directly as quickly as possible. And some of the other alternatives,

266
00:18:24,092 --> 00:18:28,022
have an intermediate step, and those again, are technical details,

267
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:32,062
but let me still linger on the difference between...

268
00:18:32,062 --> 00:18:35,992
fusion and fission. What are some advantages at a high level of nuclear

269
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:37,732
fusion as a source of energy?

270
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:42,192
- fundamentally as a source of energy. In fusion, you're taking these

271
00:18:42,232 --> 00:18:46,432
lightweight isotopes, you're bringing them together, you're releasing energy,

272
00:18:47,272 --> 00:18:51,012
and that energy is in the form of charged particles.

273
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:54,612
It's already in the form of electricity. Fusion itself has

274
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:58,232
electricity built into it without a lot of the steam or

275
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:01,912
thermal system requirements. And so, that's a really nice fundamental

276
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:05,952
benefit of fusion itself. Also, this reaction

277
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:09,772
that's really hard to do turns itself off, so you end up with that

278
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:13,692
fusion is fundamentally safe, and that's really a key requirement of

279
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:17,752
any industrial system is that it turns itself off and is safe.

280
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:20,532
You turn the key off on your car, you know it's going to turn off.

281
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:24,412
- I guess the flip side of that, just stating the obvious, but it's nice to lay it out.

282
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:29,592
nice to lay it out. For nuclear fission, it's a chain reaction, so it's hard to shut off,

283
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:32,672
reaction, so it's hard to shut off, and it works by boiling water into steam,

284
00:19:32,712 --> 00:19:36,901
by boiling water into steam, which spins turbines and produces electricity.

285
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:41,432
and produces electricity. Can you talk through this process in a nuclear fission reactor?

286
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,292
process in a nuclear fission reactor?

287
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:47,032
- In a nuclear fission reactor, you put enough of this

288
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:50,992
fissile material, uranium or plutonium, together such that

289
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:54,932
as these unstable molecules, these unstable atoms

290
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:58,552
crack open and break apart, they release heat, that the

291
00:19:58,752 --> 00:20:02,652
component parts of those are actually quite hot. And so

292
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:06,322
not only are the component parts that the uranium breaks into, and it's a whole spectrum of different atoms and atomic nuclei,

293
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,272
and it's a whole spectrum of different atoms and atomic nuclei, are hot, but it also releases neutrons.

294
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:13,992
are hot, but it also releases neutrons. It also releases more of these uncharged particles.

295
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:17,972
more of these uncharged particles. And if you do it right, this fissile material will be next to other fissile material,

296
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:21,862
this fissile material will be next to other fissile material, and so that neutron will then go and bombard another

297
00:20:21,912 --> 00:20:25,602
and so that neutron will then go and bombard another uranium nucleus, again opening that up and releasing

298
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:29,512
uranium nucleus, again opening that up and releasing more heat and more of these neutrons.

299
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:33,412
more heat and more of these neutrons. And that's how you have those reactions of a self-supporting chain reaction,

300
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:37,232
those reactions of a self-supporting chain reaction, and that chain reaction then continues.

301
00:20:37,272 --> 00:20:41,252
and that chain reaction then continues. People design fission reactors such that you have just the right balance

302
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:44,932
fission reactors such that you have just the right balance of enough neutrons are made such that the reaction is continuing,

303
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,762
of enough neutrons are made such that the reaction is continuing, but not so many neutrons are made that it speeds up.

304
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:50,112
because you don't want it to speed up.

305
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:54,332
- And there's some kind of cooling mechanisms also? Like, that's part of the art and the engineering of it?

306
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:56,632
and the engineering of it?

307
00:20:56,692 --> 00:21:00,452
- And then the key is at the same time, you want to make sure that the whole thing is in water, is typically the cooling fluid.

308
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:04,461
whole thing is in water, is typically the cooling fluid. There's some more advanced fission reactors that have different cooling fluids,

309
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:08,332
advanced fission reactors that have different cooling fluids, but water typically, where then that absorbs that both the heat

310
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:12,172
but water typically, where then that absorbs that both the heat and those extra neutrons. And so you use the water and the fluid to then

311
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:16,192
extra neutrons. And so you use the water and the fluid to then run a steam turbine to do traditional electricity generation

312
00:21:16,252 --> 00:21:19,452
run a steam turbine to do traditional electricity generation and output electricity through your steam turbine.

313
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:23,712
and output electricity through your steam turbine. You end up with complicated systems of flowing liquids and flowing water,

314
00:21:23,752 --> 00:21:26,972
up with complicated systems of flowing liquids and flowing water, balancing the heat.

315
00:21:27,372 --> 00:21:31,232
balancing the heat. A lot of fission reactor design comes from that thermal balance of keeping this reaction

316
00:21:31,312 --> 00:21:35,232
comes from that thermal balance of keeping this reaction going, making sure it doesn't speed up, because that's

317
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:38,961
going, making sure it doesn't speed up, because that's an uncontrolled chain reaction, which you would not want,

318
00:21:39,032 --> 00:21:42,152
an uncontrolled chain reaction, which you would not want, and balancing the cooling and the output of getting the water out of it.

319
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:48,452
want, and balancing the cooling and the output of getting the water out of it.

320
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:52,392
- So we should say that for reasons you already laid out, maybe you can speak to it a bit more,

321
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:56,052
maybe you can speak to it a bit more, is nuclear fusion is much safer. So there's no chain

322
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:59,832
is much safer. So there's no chain reaction going on. You can just shut it off.

323
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:03,172
You can just shut it off. But it should also be said that as far as I understand, the current fission nuclear reactors

324
00:22:03,232 --> 00:22:07,172
as far as I understand, the current fission nuclear reactors are also very safe.

325
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:10,892
are also very safe. I think there's a perception that nuclear fission reactors are unsafe, they're dangerous.

326
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:14,612
fission reactors are unsafe, they're dangerous. And if you just look empirically at the statistics,

327
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:18,472
look empirically at the statistics, that the fear is not justified by the actual safety data.

328
00:22:18,512 --> 00:22:22,292
by the actual safety data. Can you just speak to that a little bit?

329
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:25,992
- Yeah. We've been talking about the reaction processes themselves, but I think fundamentally,

330
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:29,792
fundamentally, let's take a step back and look a little broader and say, "Let's look at what we care about,"

331
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:33,822
look at what we care about, which is the power plant, making electricity. And I look at this from a nuclear engineer's point of view.

332
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:37,522
this from a nuclear engineer's point of view. I spent a lot of years studying these systems.

333
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:41,522
studying these systems. And modern fission reactors, I believe, are engineered to be safe.

334
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:45,502
believe, are engineered to be safe. They're engineered in ways where as those reactions maybe speed up

335
00:22:45,552 --> 00:22:49,452
where as those reactions maybe speed up and those systems get hotter,

336
00:22:50,092 --> 00:22:53,882
and those systems get hotter, they actually are built to expand and cool down passively and natively.

337
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:57,952
cool down passively and natively. And there's protection systems in place that modern systems are quite safe

338
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:01,972
place that modern systems are quite safe from an engineering perspective.

339
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:05,932
perspective. And so I believe that we have figured out how to build nuclear fission reactors in a way

340
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:09,852
build nuclear fission reactors in a way where the engineering of the power plant is safe.

341
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:13,782
plant is safe. I would say that I look back at the history of what we've built over time,

342
00:23:13,832 --> 00:23:17,392
of what we've built over time, and the challenge hasn't come to the engineering actually.

343
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:21,172
engineering actually. I believe the engineers have solved these problems. The problem comes from humans,

344
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:24,892
The problem comes from humans, and the problem comes from other things around nuclear power.

345
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:28,742
comes from other things around nuclear power. You have to enrich that uranium to put it in a plant.

346
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:32,622
enrich that uranium to put it in a plant. And the plant's safe, but you had to enrich that uranium,

347
00:23:32,632 --> 00:23:36,432
but you had to enrich that uranium, and that is some of the problem. Or a plant is designed to run

348
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:40,472
Or a plant is designed to run for a certain number of decades safely, but do we run it longer than that?

349
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:43,892
but do we run it longer than that? And so those are where I think the real challenges happen,

350
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:47,892
the real challenges happen, is more with the humans around these systems than the engineering of the power plants themselves.

351
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:50,232
than the engineering of the power plants themselves.

352
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:54,132
- Well, I have to ask then, what do you think happened in Chernobyl? What lessons do we learn from Chernobyl

353
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:57,862
What lessons do we learn from Chernobyl nuclear disaster and maybe also Three Mile Island and Fukushima accidents?

354
00:23:57,892 --> 00:24:01,752
Fukushima accidents? I think you're suggesting that it has to do with the humans a bit.

355
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,912
humans a bit.

356
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:06,962
- So with Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually put Three Mile Island in a different category.

357
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:10,752
in a different category. In fact, some of the recent news in the last year is that we're gonna be restarting Three Mile Island,

358
00:24:10,852 --> 00:24:14,772
year is that we're gonna be restarting Three Mile Island, because there's such a need for clean base load power.

359
00:24:14,852 --> 00:24:18,662
such a need for clean base load power. So that's actually a very interesting other topic we should talk about,

360
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:22,572
interesting other topic we should talk about, is why and how we're doing that. But more than that,

361
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:26,332
But more than that, going back to the accidents that did happen in both of those systems, you can point to

362
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:30,752
in both of those systems, you can point to the human failure rather than the engineering failures of those systems.

363
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:35,612
the human failure rather than the engineering failures of those systems. That in Fukushima specifically,

364
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:39,432
That in Fukushima specifically, there were multiple nuclear fission reactors on the same site that successfully

365
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:43,402
reactors on the same site that successfully kept running through the tsunami, totally successfully,

366
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:47,006
the tsunami, totally successfully, and were only later shut down for more political reasons.

367
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:50,736
more political reasons. But the old one, the oldest of them that had been on site for long periods,

368
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:54,646
them that had been on site for long periods, and maybe, maybe too long, I think some experts have looked at this in the past

369
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:57,966
I think some experts have looked at this in the past was where some of the problems actually happened.

370
00:24:57,976 --> 00:25:01,476
was where some of the problems actually happened.

371
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:08,796
And so, I look to that less as a failure of the engineering of the power plants,

372
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:12,736
engineering of the power plants, and more of the humans around those systems.

373
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:16,496
around those systems. That we should be operating these plants as designed, and then I believe they're safe.

374
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,356
these plants as designed, and then I believe they're safe. And that gets to some of the atomic weapons questions

375
00:25:20,396 --> 00:25:24,196
And that gets to some of the atomic weapons questions that I think are the other part around nuclear reactors

376
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:30,396
are the other part around nuclear reactors and fission reactors that are concerning for me.

377
00:25:30,436 --> 00:25:34,316
- Can you speak to those? So, maybe this is a good place to also lay out the difference between nuclear fission

378
00:25:34,336 --> 00:25:37,576
lay out the difference between nuclear fission power plants and nuclear fission weapons,

379
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:43,116
power plants and nuclear fission weapons, and maybe

380
00:25:43,196 --> 00:25:51,016
also nuclear fusion power plants and nuclear fusion weapons. Like,

381
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:53,256
what are the differences here?

382
00:25:53,316 --> 00:26:00,776
- Fusion power plants can't be used to make nuclear weapons. Fundamentally, the

383
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:04,656
processes in fusion aren't the same processes that happen

384
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:08,176
in nuclear bombs and nuclear weapons. It's actually one reason

385
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:12,436
I started in fusion, and most of our team

386
00:26:12,496 --> 00:26:16,456
thinks about the mission of fusion, of delivering clean, safe electricity, is

387
00:26:16,476 --> 00:26:20,296
it also can't be used to make weapons. And I think

388
00:26:20,356 --> 00:26:24,196
that's a little bit of a distinction from traditional nuclear

389
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:28,096
fission reactors, is that while I totally believe as a

390
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:31,936
nuclear engineer, we can build power plants now that are safe, that

391
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:35,756
aren't going to have reactions. They use a fuel, uranium

392
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:39,956
and plutonium, that can be used to make nuclear

393
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:43,956
weapons. We know that if you take enough fissile material

394
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:47,056
together, enough uranium and plutonium, put it in a small volume,

395
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:52,096
that it will not just create a reaction, but it will create a supercritical

396
00:26:52,136 --> 00:26:56,076
reaction that will then continue and grow and release a tremendous amount of energy all at

397
00:26:56,136 --> 00:27:00,056
once. And that is a bomb. That is a bad situation, and that is what

398
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:03,956
we want to avoid. A lot of the key is recognizing that even though there are

399
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:07,416
things called fusion bombs, the H-bomb, the hydrogen

400
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:11,136
bomb, the hydrogen bomb has uranium in it. It's still a

401
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,896
fission bomb. So, fundamentally, this works because you

402
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:22,776
have a fission reaction, a primary, and that creates radiation that induces a

403
00:27:22,796 --> 00:27:26,276
fusion reaction with a small amount of fusion fuel that

404
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:30,116
then boosts that uranium reaction again. And so

405
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:34,326
most of the energy, in fact 90% of the energy in an H-bomb,

406
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:37,096
is all still from the uranium reactions themselves.

407
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:40,996
- Yeah, I think people call it a nuclear fusion bomb, a hydrogen

408
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:44,865
bomb, but really it's still a nuclear fission bomb. It's just that

409
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:48,916
fusion is a part of the process to make it more powerful, but you still need, like you

410
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:52,696
said, the uranium fuel. So it's not accurate to think of it as a

411
00:27:52,716 --> 00:27:53,826
fusion bomb really.

412
00:27:53,856 --> 00:27:57,836
- And if you take away that fissile material, that nuclear

413
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,666
fission reaction, the fusion reaction doesn't happen at all.

414
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:05,576
In fact, researchers have

415
00:28:05,696 --> 00:28:09,516
over the decades tried to make an all fusion bomb and been very

416
00:28:09,556 --> 00:28:13,216
unsuccessful at it. The physics and the engineering don't support it can ever

417
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:17,136
happen with our understanding today. The topic we're talking about is more

418
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:20,936
broadly called proliferation, and this is the creation

419
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:25,036
of nuclear weapons in the world and the distribution of

420
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:28,286
those weapons. And something we know as physicists and

421
00:28:28,336 --> 00:28:31,656
engineers is that fusion can't be used to make

422
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:35,536
nuclear weapons. We know that. But that is not

423
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:40,436
sort of widely known. And part of what we went out to do

424
00:28:40,476 --> 00:28:43,976
is work with the proliferation experts in the world, the people who

425
00:28:44,076 --> 00:28:47,856
work to prevent nuclear weapons from being made, being created, being

426
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:51,816
shared throughout the world, because we know the challenges, the geopolitical challenges that

427
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:55,536
happen. And we went to those proliferation experts, and we were

428
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:59,556
worried they would have the sort of the same

429
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:03,576
historical question of, like, "Well, the word nuclear is in fusion, so therefore it

430
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:07,396
must be related." And, and in fact, the total

431
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:11,296
opposite happened. What they told us is, "Please, please go

432
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,376
develop fusion power plants absolutely as fast as possible. The

433
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:19,346
world needs this." And the proliferation experts were telling

434
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:23,356
us that otherwise people would start enriching uranium throughout

435
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:27,336
the world, and we'd be building enriched uranium power plants because we need

436
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:31,186
the electricity that's clean and base load. But in those

437
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:35,076
processes, they'll be making fuel that could be one day used for

438
00:29:35,086 --> 00:29:38,546
atomic weapons, for nuclear weapons, and they were worried that,

439
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:41,676
that the growth of this enriched uranium, think about the

440
00:29:41,716 --> 00:29:45,276
centrifuges, that having a lot more centrifuges happening all over the

441
00:29:45,296 --> 00:29:48,986
world would lead to more weapons, at least the possibility of

442
00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:52,916
it. And so they are pushing us as fast as possible, go build

443
00:29:52,956 --> 00:29:56,896
fusion generators and get them deployed everywhere. Not just in the United States, but

444
00:29:56,996 --> 00:30:00,416
all over the world so that we're building fusion power

445
00:30:00,976 --> 00:30:04,906
and that's meeting humanity's needs, not this other thing. And

446
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,846
so I was really pleasantly surprised. We've written a number of papers and worked with those

447
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:12,836
communities on this of what does it mean, how is

448
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:17,976
fusion power safe and can't be used for nuclear weapons.

449
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,156
- So, this might be interesting to ask on the geopolitics side of

450
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:24,416
things. I have the chance to interview a few world leaders coming

451
00:30:24,476 --> 00:30:27,856
up. By way of advice, what questions should I ask world

452
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:35,296
leaders to figure out the geopolitics of nuclear, nuclear proliferation.

453
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:39,176
...nuclear weapons, nuclear fission power

454
00:30:39,256 --> 00:30:43,316
plants, and nuclear fusion power plants? What's the interesting, intricate

455
00:30:44,156 --> 00:30:47,576
complexity there that you could maybe speak to?

456
00:30:47,636 --> 00:30:54,240
- The question I would want to ask is, "What would you do if we could deliver for you

457
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,680
low-cost, clean, industrial scale, tens or hundreds of megawatts of fusion power

458
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,750
that's low-cost, clean, baseload and doesn't

459
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,400
have the geopolitical consequences of uranium and

460
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,280
plutonium, of fissile material, what would you do

461
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,920
there? How would that change your view of the next 30 years?

462
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,850
- But also, there's a lot of geopolitics connected to oil, natural gas-

463
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,820
...and other sources of energy which I think are important in Saudi Arabia,

464
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,710
in the Middle East, in Russia. I mean,

465
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,600
all across the world. And that's interesting too. So do you think actually if everybody has

466
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,770
nuclear fusion power plants, that

467
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,680
alleviates some of the geopolitical tension that have to do

468
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,700
with energy, other energy sources?

469
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,429
- I certainly do, that the fuel is in seawater all over Earth.

470
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,010
Everybody has deuterium. And everybody has it.

471
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,240
And so you can't have a monopoly on the fuel.

472
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,870
And no one can control the fuel and no one can turn off the fuel, no one can cut a

473
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,550
pipeline. That just cannot happen with fusion. And

474
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,340
so if we can deploy those plants and we can deploy them quickly,

475
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:12,200
then it decouples the ability of any one or any few countries to control energy.

476
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,040
- Okay, so let's sort of return to the basic question, we already mentioned it a

477
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,480
little bit, but is nuclear fusion safe?

478
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:26,300
So the power plants that we're talking about, fusion power plants, are they safe?

479
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,320
- Yes. Fusion power is fundamentally safe. The

480
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,300
physics and the reactions of the fusion system itself

481
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,380
means you don't have runaways. And so we've talked about some of the human

482
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,920
factors around power plants and power systems and industrial scale

483
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,300
systems. And that's something that we build into the design of these

484
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,980
from today. We look at, "How

485
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,360
these systems might fail?" And in fact, some of the analysis we do

486
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,649
is we did this analysis for the Nuclear Regulatory

487
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:04,660
Commission over the last few years, looking at how do you regulate

488
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,529
fusion power. As we're building the first fusion power plant, we need to make sure we're

489
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,140
regulated safely. And so we spent a lot of time doing the

490
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,740
technical case and the political case in the United States, of how to

491
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,760
regulate fusion. And so the analysis

492
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,640
we did is assume you have a fusion power plant that's operating. And

493
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,969
then at any one time, a meteor strikes it. The whole thing is

494
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,920
vaporized. What is the impact of that? So this is worse than you could

495
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,720
ever imagine an actual physical scenario, but let's start

496
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,560
there. And the answer is, you don't need to evacuate the

497
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,910
populace nearby the fusion power plant. And

498
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,370
one of the keys, I think, that I come to when I think about

499
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:53,969
this is the fuel. In that, in a fusion generator, you are continuously feeding

500
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,020
in this hydrogen, these deuterium fuels. And

501
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,960
at any one time in a Helion fusion system, and most fusion

502
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,970
systems, you have one second of fuel in that

503
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:09,850
system. And so what that means is if you stop putting fuel into

504
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,850
that system, fusion just stops. But what it also means is that

505
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,179
if something really catastrophic happened and, for whatever

506
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,900
reason, you have all that fuel that's not in the system. And

507
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,830
fusion is so hard to make happen. You hit it with a meteor, you do

508
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,520
anything of that nature, and fusion doesn't happen. That

509
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,300
hydrogen, that heavy water, that deuterium, just goes back into the

510
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,020
environment safely and cleanly without issue. And so that's the

511
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,020
fundamental safety mechanism of fusion, and you can compare that

512
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,900
with other types of power plants, oil or a coal power

513
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,900
plant. You might have a large pile of coal that then catches fire and burns. And

514
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,400
it's not catastrophic, but you have a large coal fire for a long time releasing

515
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:55,560
toxic fumes that you may have to deal with. And in nuclear

516
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:59,300
power, in a fission power plant, you may have several years of fuel sitting in the

517
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,800
core. And in that case, if something bad happened, you have all that potential

518
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,380
energy for things to happen. But in

519
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,960
fusion, you have literally one second of fuel at any time in the

520
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,819
system. And having a tank of deuterium, which we have around all the time,

521
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:17,720
can't do fusion by itself. It needs that complex system.

522
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,660
- I love that there's, like, a PowerPoint going on in a secret meeting about

523
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,440
what happens if a meteor hits a fusion power plant.

524
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,340
Okay, so that's really interesting. What about the waste? What kind of waste

525
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,600
is there for fusion power plants?

526
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,150
- So the fusion reaction itself is still fundamentally an atomic

527
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,980
reaction. And so during this reaction, you do create ionizing

528
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,560
radiation. You create X-rays, you create neutrons, and you create all these charged

529
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,420
particles. The charged particles themselves for a fusion reaction are all

530
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,080
contained in the- the fusion system. And

531
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,980
the X-rays, similar to think about a dentist office,

532
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,770
although a lot more than that, but that type of same X-ray and

533
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,900
X-ray energy is absorbed by the fusion system. But the thing we do care about is those

534
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,860
neutrons. And so we do have, in a fusion system, activation.

535
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,760
We have, during its operation, neutrons are made and leave, and so we have

536
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,610
to shield these fusion systems during their operation.

537
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,500
and so this is very similar, in fact, this is a lot of the work we did with the

538
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,430
Nuclear Regulatory Commission over the last number of years. That

539
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,340
there was a landmark agreement that happened for the NRC that then

540
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,160
was codified into law last year called the ADVANCE Act, which

541
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,964
is really powerful because it says for the very first time-... how the

542
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,804
US government, leading the way on this, which I'm really proud of, will

543
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:40,044
regulate fusion. And this gets into a little bit of the

544
00:36:40,084 --> 00:36:43,044
details, but the way the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

545
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:46,424
regulates nuclear things in the United States

546
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:50,404
is in these different sets of statutes. And nuclear

547
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:54,284
is in these different sets of statutes. And nuclear reactors are regulated under something called Part 50. And there's a

548
00:36:54,324 --> 00:36:58,224
lot of variety of the regulatory language around that, but most of it is

549
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:02,224
to handle special nuclear materials, uranium and plutonium. But

550
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:06,464
fusion is not. Fusion is regulated under something called Part 30.

551
00:37:06,484 --> 00:37:09,364
And Part 30 is how hospitals are regulated, particle

552
00:37:09,404 --> 00:37:13,254
accelerators, other types of irradiators where as

553
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,973
they're operating, you have very high energy particles, ionizing radiation, and you have

554
00:37:17,004 --> 00:37:20,784
to protect operators from it. And you have to shield them, and so we

555
00:37:20,804 --> 00:37:24,724
build concrete shields. And if you came and visited Helion, you would see plastic,

556
00:37:24,824 --> 00:37:28,784
Plastic, borated polyethylene and concrete shielding,

557
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:32,204
To protect operators and equipment from the fusion reactions while they're

558
00:37:32,244 --> 00:37:36,024
happening. But again, you turn them off, and those fusion reactions

559
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:43,244
stop. And that's really the key. There's a funny story related to that. We,

560
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:47,204
We've been building fusion systems that do fusion a

561
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:50,884
long time, and a- at some level, we- they got

562
00:37:50,944 --> 00:37:54,524
powerful enough doing enough fusion, we started building these shields and- and

563
00:37:54,624 --> 00:37:58,404
shielding them like a particle accelerator. And I went

564
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,144
to the regulatory bodies that regulate Part

565
00:38:02,264 --> 00:38:06,244
30. This is in Washington state. It's the Department of Health. And so I went to

566
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,984
the Department of Health and said, "Here's an application for a fusion generator

567
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:14,534
shielding permit as- as a particle accelerator."

568
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:18,414
And uh, the very first question I got asked was, "Great, where do the

569
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:22,364
patients go?" Because the standard form had a patient,

570
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:26,424
As a hospital, the patient dose for the particle accelerator, and then the

571
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:26,944
shielding.

572
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:30,874
And we talked all about the shielding and the operators, which is very similar for a Helion system.

573
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:34,704
We said, "No, no patients at all. No one's inside this thing. Our goal is to

574
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:38,294
generate electricity one day." This was a lot of years ago.

575
00:38:38,384 --> 00:38:42,364
And we were able to go through and work with the state agencies to

576
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:46,314
license these fusion particle accelerators. We were, as far as we know,

577
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:53,224
the first licensed fusion system ever as a particle accelerator for those first

578
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:57,084
systems. The first license we had was in 2020.

579
00:38:57,144 --> 00:39:00,754
We then have gone on and now license several of our fusion systems that we've

580
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:06,644
built that do fusion, both the shielding as well as some of the fuel processes.

581
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:11,924
- So high level, what are the different ways to build a nuclear

582
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:19,024
fusion power plant? Can you explain what a tokamak is, what a stellarator

583
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:25,344
is, and what's the linear approach that Helion is using?

584
00:39:25,384 --> 00:39:31,444
- So there are a number of ways to do fusion. And fundamentally, in all fusion

585
00:39:31,504 --> 00:39:35,004
approaches, you're trying to do the same fundamental physical

586
00:39:35,084 --> 00:39:39,044
process, which is take these lightweight isotopes, heat them up, so

587
00:39:39,084 --> 00:39:42,444
that they can move at high velocity, over 100 million

588
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:45,564
degrees, bring enough of them together. We call it

589
00:39:45,724 --> 00:39:49,484
density. Enough of them together in a certain volume, so that you

590
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:53,384
have reactions happening at a higher rate, and keep them

591
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:57,393
together long enough that they are able to collide into each other and do

592
00:39:57,424 --> 00:40:01,364
fusion and release energy. That's the fundamental core. Now,

593
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:05,164
how you do that, how you bring those particles together, how you hold them

594
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:09,124
together long enough, there's a wide range of technologies that, as humans,

595
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:12,784
we've been exploring since the 1950s.

596
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:16,484
And I think about several main categories. If you look

597
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:20,364
at the fusion funding out there, government funding in the world, private funding

598
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:24,374
actually has quite a different profile, which is an interesting

599
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:28,404
thing to talk about. But in public funding, in federal funding in the United States, there's

600
00:40:28,464 --> 00:40:32,204
two mainline programs called inertial fusion and

601
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:36,224
magnetic fusion. And in inertial fusion, what

602
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:40,144
you're trying to do is bring together and push together by a

603
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:44,104
variety of means, physical means, those particles. You push them

604
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:48,044
together. The most common is called laser inertial fusion.

605
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:52,004
Our colleagues at the National Ignition Facility did this really well and

606
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:56,124
made world records in the last few years for being able to demonstrate you can do

607
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:59,844
this and do it at scale. Where you take very high power

608
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:03,564
lasers and pulse them together to combine them to do

609
00:41:03,584 --> 00:41:07,074
fusion for a pulse, for a very short period of time.

610
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:10,094
Nanoseconds, billionths of a second. The other

611
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:14,224
extreme, and you mentioned tokamaks and stellarators.

612
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,964
Stellarators are actually my favorite. So we'll talk about those.

613
00:41:17,984 --> 00:41:21,164
As a graduate student in fusion, the stellarator is the first thing you learn about.

614
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:26,604
Because there's a mathematical solution for a stellarator that solves perfectly.

615
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:30,124
And you can write it out and you can solve it, and

616
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:33,644
analytically, it's very simple. Building one is very

617
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:37,464
hard. And so it's taken humanity a number

618
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:41,354
of decades to be able to build stellarators and we can do it now

619
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:45,244
with the Wendelstein 7-X that came online in the last

620
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:49,784
few years, being the premier stellarator in the world.

621
00:41:49,864 --> 00:41:52,364
- I should say, all the different ways to do fusion

622
00:41:53,284 --> 00:41:56,344
all just look so badass in terms of engineering.

623
00:41:57,464 --> 00:42:01,404
Creating this containment, extremely high temperature,

624
00:42:01,464 --> 00:42:05,244
high density. Everything's moving super fast.

625
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:09,274
Everything is happening super fast. It's just fascinating that humans are able to do it.

626
00:42:09,284 --> 00:42:13,024
Like, there are certain things, accelerators of that a little bit, but this is

627
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:17,044
even cooler, because you're generating energy that can power humanity

628
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:21,064
with this machine. Anyway, can you just speak a little bit more to the

629
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:23,524
inertial and the magnetic fusion systems?

630
00:42:23,564 --> 00:42:26,744
- In a magnetic system, your goal is not to

631
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:31,744
push together those particles as fast as possible. Your

632
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:35,764
goal is to hold on to them for as long as possible. And to do that, we

633
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:39,504
use magnetic fields. So let's take a step back. What is a magnetic field?

634
00:42:39,784 --> 00:42:43,640
So in an electromagnet, there are a

635
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,339
variety of ways to make a magnetic field. One of the most famous, I think everyone is familiar

636
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,740
with, is Earth itself. Earth has what we call the

637
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:54,720
magnetosphere, which is the magnetic protection that's

638
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:58,089
generated actually by the core of the Earth. But we have a

639
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,000
magnetic field around the Earth, and that magnetic

640
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,460
field protects us from particles coming from

641
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,950
the galaxy, galactic cosmic rays and solar particles that

642
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,759
would come to Earth. That magnetic field when you run a compass, you see the

643
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:17,660
magnetic field from the Earth. So we know it's happening. It's all over. But how we

644
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,589
generate it with electric currents is a little bit different. And what

645
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,560
we do is that we have a loop of wire, and the simplest way to think

646
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,430
about it is literally a round loop. And in that loop, you have

647
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,330
electrons. You have electrical current that's running. And when electrical current, this

648
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,330
is some of Maxwell's equations that we discovered in the 1800s, that when

649
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,960
you have an electrical current in a wire, it generates a magnetic

650
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,680
field inside that wire. And so when you look

651
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:48,380
at fusion systems, you always have these big

652
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,029
magnetic coils with large amounts of current. We don't run a little bit of current.

653
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:55,600
In our systems, we have hundreds of mega amps of current. If you think

654
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,190
about at your house, you have your

655
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,990
breaker box with 200 amps or maybe a 400 amp breaker

656
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,999
box, and we run 100 million amps of electrical current. So

657
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,930
massive amounts of electrical current to be able to do this. So that

658
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,640
magnetic field that's generated inside that magnetic

659
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,630
coil has some really special properties, and we take advantage of

660
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,650
those properties to do fusion. And some of those properties are not

661
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,620
intuitive. So here's one of my favorites. When you have an

662
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,470
electromagnetic field, you have this coil with electricity going around

663
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:34,020
it and you have a magnetic field inside of it, and then you

664
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,020
have a test particle, a charged particle, an electron

665
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,000
or an ion, which is, if you imagine to generate this, I

666
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,830
have a coil with electrons moving around it. But if I put one in the middle of

667
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,350
it, in this magnetic field, some really interesting things happen.

668
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,000
That electron or that ion, that charged particle is what's called

669
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,400
magnetized. And what magnetized means is that it's

670
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:00,340
trapped on that field line. In fact, even really more interesting

671
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,368
is that it oscillates around that field line. And so the way I

672
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,190
think about this is if you think about the Earth's magnetosphere again, and you think

673
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:12,100
about the charged particles, the aurora, the northern lights, is a

674
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:16,220
charged particle trapped in the Earth's magnetic field going around

675
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:21,180
the Earth's magnetic field. And in the same way, in fusion, we do the same thing here on Earth,

676
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,160
but in a smaller direction where we trap these particles on magnetic

677
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,640
fields, and they can go around and stay trapped to that magnetic field line.

678
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,670
- How much of the physics

679
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,740
at this scale is understood here? Like, how these systems behave

680
00:45:36,259 --> 00:45:43,540
when you attract a magnetic field in this way? Like, is this fundamentally now an

681
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,400
engineering problem, or is there a new physics to be discovered about how the

682
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,580
system is behaving?

683
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,560
- In fusion, the physics we're using is actually quite

684
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,250
old. The fundamental electromagnetic physics is 1800s

685
00:45:56,279 --> 00:46:00,100
physics. The fundamental atomic physics is early 1900s. And

686
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:04,100
so the fundamental physics of how these work is very

687
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,060
well understood. Putting them all together into a power plant, that's

688
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,069
hard. You can do the math. Every introductory

689
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,620
grad student does the math on a stellarator and says, "This is all I need to

690
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,490
do. I just need to make a magnetic coil in this very

691
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,560
complicated shape. And then fusion will happen." However,

692
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,380
doing that in practice is actually quite challenging.

693
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,240
- So maybe you could speak a little bit more. So the stellarator and the

694
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:34,859
tokamak, what's the difference between those two? They're both magnetic fusion

695
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,980
systems? And then what does Helion do?

696
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,680
- The tokamak and the stellarator are both magnetic systems. Their

697
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,549
goal is to generate this magnetic field and

698
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,660
hold onto the fusion fuel long enough. Like I mentioned,

699
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:53,359
these charged particles are trapped on the magnetic field. In fact, they're oscillating.

700
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:57,080
We call that a gyro orbit, is the radius that they oscillate

701
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,150
around this magnetic field. And we've been talking about atomic physics,

702
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,790
where everything is at this nanoscale. But gyro orbits are

703
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,819
not. Gyro orbits for these fusion particles are measured in inches.

704
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,830
And so they're in, on a scale that we can see and

705
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,700
measure and understand really intuitively. And in a

706
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,600
magnetic system, your goal is to simply trap as many of these particles as

707
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,180
you can for long enough, and heat them so they're hot

708
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,049
enough so that they bang into each other. They collide enough that you're doing

709
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,910
fusion. And you're doing enough fusion to overcome as fast as you're losing

710
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,590
those particles. And so that's what happens when you put particles in a

711
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,600
magnetic field and you try to hold onto it. The challenge is that it's

712
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,100
really hard to hold onto them long enough. These particles are moving

713
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,069
around. They're moving at very high velocity, millions of miles per hour. They're

714
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,310
colliding with each other and they're getting knocked off and getting knocked

715
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,340
away. So we've talked about inertial fusion, where you try

716
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:58,350
to confine a fusion plasma by crushing

717
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,359
it as fast as possible. And magnetic fusion, where you just simply

718
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,890
have a magnetic field and your goal is to hold onto it for as long as

719
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,830
possible. But there's another way to do fusion, and

720
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:11,330
in some ways, it's one of the earliest

721
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,060
approaches for fusion that was successful. As scientists and

722
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,060
engineers, maybe we're not too creative with the terminology. We call the technique

723
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,859
We call the technique that Helion uses magneto inertial fusion, because it does a little bit of both.

724
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,940
So to understand that, we can actually go back in history a little bit and think about the

725
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,988
evolution of some of these approaches to fusion. And so from our perspective, we

726
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:37,948
look at the technology that we use as built on

727
00:48:37,988 --> 00:48:41,948
physics experiments that were very successful in the 1950s.

728
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:45,687
And in those systems, the earliest pioneers of

729
00:48:45,728 --> 00:48:49,627
fusion said, "I know, we understand the physics.

730
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:53,627
We have to take these gases, heat them to 100 million degrees, and then

731
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:57,558
confine them, push them together so that fusion happens." And so, what

732
00:48:57,587 --> 00:49:01,127
is the best way to do that? So some of the earliest programs we call

733
00:49:01,187 --> 00:49:05,147
them theta pinch. And what those programs were, were a linear

734
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:08,508
topology, because we knew how to build these magnets. It's called a

735
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:12,458
solenoid, where you take a series of electric coils, you run electrical

736
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:16,458
current through them, that generates a magnetic field. Great, so you have a magnetic

737
00:49:16,528 --> 00:49:20,216
field. Now you add your fusion particles. Okay? So you've added fusion

738
00:49:20,308 --> 00:49:24,248
particles to this solenoid. Here's the challenge. Those

739
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:27,888
particles, as they're sitting in that magnetic field in this nice magnet,

740
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:31,528
escape. They leave out the ends, 'cause there's nothing holding them in.

741
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:34,968
Great. So that makes sense. And so that doesn't work,

742
00:49:35,008 --> 00:49:38,958
okay? So then the next approach is to say, "Well, one branch of

743
00:49:39,028 --> 00:49:42,848
fusion said, 'Okay, well, to solve that, why don't we take the solenoid and bend it

744
00:49:42,928 --> 00:49:46,798
around? Let's just make it a big donut. So as they're escaping, they go around and

745
00:49:46,848 --> 00:49:50,758
around in a circle.' Great. That's a great approach. And so one branch of

746
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:52,638
fusion went down that direction.

747
00:49:53,687 --> 00:49:57,147
And that became, that evolved into the stellarator and the

748
00:49:57,167 --> 00:50:00,948
tokamak. Different ways of taking those solenoids and wrapping them

749
00:50:01,048 --> 00:50:04,988
around so that the plasmas go 'round and 'round in that magnetic field and are

750
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:08,928
held- those charged particles are held long enough that fusion happens. But there's a

751
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:12,888
different way to do it. And so the theta pinch was what was born in the

752
00:50:12,908 --> 00:50:16,268
1950s of, "Take this magnetic field and, oh, they're trying to

753
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,788
escape. Great. Let's not let them escape. Let's close the

754
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,408
bottle-" Mm-hmm. "...let's close the ends." And so we make the magnetic field much

755
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:27,268
stronger at the ends. This one was called the mirror. And so the idea was that

756
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:31,288
the particles would bounce in between. And that worked,

757
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:35,048
and they got hotter and hotter and hotter. But guess what? As you kind of would imagine,

758
00:50:35,228 --> 00:50:38,848
as this mirror topology, this linear topology, the

759
00:50:38,908 --> 00:50:42,877
pressure increased inside, the particle pressure, the

760
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:46,618
particles tried to push back on the magnetic field. They were trying to escape now.

761
00:50:46,647 --> 00:50:50,638
They're trying, they're getting hotter and hotter. And just as you imagine, hot gas in a

762
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:54,528
balloon tries to get out the ends, you could not hold it tight enough

763
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:58,508
at the ends to keep those particles in. And in fact, the problem is the hottest ones

764
00:50:58,528 --> 00:51:02,288
were the ones that would escape. Mm-hmm. And so you do a good job of heating it, and they'd all leave out the

765
00:51:02,348 --> 00:51:06,207
ends. Okay? So then the next iteration said, "Okay, well, why don't we just

766
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:10,008
not try to hold onto it very long? Why don't we squeeze it?"

767
00:51:10,087 --> 00:51:13,948
And so rather than just holding it constantly, let's now crush it. So

768
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,207
we built this solenoid, we pinched the ends, and

769
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:20,968
then we crushed it. And what I mean by crushing it is

770
00:51:20,988 --> 00:51:24,928
not actually, like, crushing any magnets or changing the- the

771
00:51:24,968 --> 00:51:28,587
topology or moving any parts, but just rapidly

772
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:32,557
increasing the magnetic field. And so going from a magnetic field that's

773
00:51:32,587 --> 00:51:36,107
just holding it to now taking all those particles, if you imagine they

774
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:39,508
if you imagine they were streaming around

775
00:51:39,548 --> 00:51:43,397
together, and then rapidly increasing the magnetic field so that those particles get closer and closer together.

776
00:51:43,408 --> 00:51:47,207
So you increase the density. And now fusion starts to really happen.

777
00:51:47,216 --> 00:51:51,098
And now fusion starts to really happen. But they

778
00:51:51,098 --> 00:51:54,868
ended up hitting a technological limit. So this is the part

779
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:58,728
that- that I look back and I'm, I look at the pioneers

780
00:51:58,808 --> 00:52:02,188
that, in 1958, there was some pioneering work

781
00:52:02,207 --> 00:52:05,988
done. And this was in California, what later became

782
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:09,808
Livermore Labs. There was also some work done at other national

783
00:52:09,888 --> 00:52:13,508
labs too. These were all federally funded programs to explore

784
00:52:13,567 --> 00:52:17,268
this theta pinch topology. Can you just squeeze the plasma down fast enough, hard enough?

785
00:52:17,308 --> 00:52:20,538
plasma down fast enough, hard enough? This was

786
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:23,388
1958. The transistor was sitting in the

787
00:52:23,448 --> 00:52:27,228
laboratory, and they were commuting, they were turning

788
00:52:27,308 --> 00:52:31,107
on millions of amps of electrical current. And they were doing it, we haven't talked about the time scales,

789
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:34,417
time scales, but they were doing it in millionths of a

790
00:52:34,528 --> 00:52:38,518
second: microseconds, megahertz speeds. And this was in 1958.

791
00:52:38,768 --> 00:52:42,488
No transistor, no CPUs, and no electrical switches, none of the things that I take for

792
00:52:42,647 --> 00:52:46,328
and and no electrical switches, none of the things that I take for

793
00:52:46,368 --> 00:52:50,248
granted every day. And so they were able to show at that time the

794
00:52:50,288 --> 00:52:54,107
highest performing fusion systems. They got to temperatures... They didn't get to

795
00:52:54,207 --> 00:52:58,038
100 million degrees, not quite then, but they got to 50 million degrees. They were

796
00:52:58,087 --> 00:53:02,008
outperforming everything else in fusion, but they reached the technical limit where they just could not

797
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:08,948
build it anymore. And so they, the- those pioneers, went in a different

798
00:53:08,968 --> 00:53:12,728
direction, and they started down the laser inertial path of saying like, "Okay, well, we

799
00:53:12,788 --> 00:53:17,868
can't do these electromagnetic pinches, but we

800
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:21,968
now have inv- this new thing has invented the laser," which turns on in nanoseconds.

801
00:53:22,008 --> 00:53:25,968
It's fast. It's interesting. Let's go down that path. And it's not... You

802
00:53:25,988 --> 00:53:29,948
have to fast-forward a couple of decades to researchers

803
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:33,988
found with some of these theta pinches when they're operated in a very specific

804
00:53:34,048 --> 00:53:37,877
way, something else happened, something new happened, and

805
00:53:38,428 --> 00:53:42,067
that these plasmas where before they squeezed them

806
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:46,368
very hard, and just like squeezing a tube of toothpaste, they squirted out the ends.

807
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:49,957
Now it didn't squirt out the ends. It actually pushed back. It stayed

808
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:53,988
confined. It stayed trapped inside that linear topology. Even though

809
00:53:54,188 --> 00:53:57,587
the ends were open, the plasma didn't leave. And so

810
00:53:58,107 --> 00:54:01,768
there was a large amount of programs of, like, "What is happening here?" This is an accidental

811
00:54:01,848 --> 00:54:05,828
discovery in plasma physics that something new is happening. And

812
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:09,678
what we discovered is we now call the field reversed configuration.

813
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:13,567
there's numerous programs of FRC, field reversed

814
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:17,428
configuration programs both at national labs. There's actually a

815
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:20,348
number of private companies now of people building field reversed

816
00:54:20,408 --> 00:54:24,368
configurations. And they have some really unique properties, but

817
00:54:24,748 --> 00:54:28,488
fundamentally, talking about the main difference, I describe the solenoid with magnetic

818
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:31,908
fields throughout the center of that volume, and plasma

819
00:54:32,048 --> 00:54:35,944
trapped going back and forth. But some other things can happen, which is really interesting.

820
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:39,864
really interesting. And what they discovered early is if

821
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:43,674
they have field going in one direction, so the plasma, the

822
00:54:43,724 --> 00:54:47,714
so the plasma, the electrical current is going around the loop

823
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,744
and the plasma is going back and forth along this magnetic field line

824
00:54:51,784 --> 00:54:55,694
inside that solenoid, inside that theta pinch.

825
00:54:55,724 --> 00:54:59,534
But then they change the direction of the magnetic field.

826
00:54:59,544 --> 00:55:03,484
And this is what we call field reversal, and this is really the key

827
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:07,174
is that you start with the plasma going in one direction, and then very rapidly,

828
00:55:07,244 --> 00:55:10,944
you change the direction. You change and reverse the direction of that field.

829
00:55:11,004 --> 00:55:14,524
And something really interesting happens, which is the plasma,

830
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:18,504
this fusion fuel, these charged particles which are trapped

831
00:55:18,564 --> 00:55:22,524
on the magnetic field lines that are moving back and forth,

832
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:26,364
you change the direction. What that means is that you're trying to take

833
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:30,684
that electrical current and that magnetic field and reverse its direction,

834
00:55:30,764 --> 00:55:34,684
flip it, but it can't flip fast enough. The plasma is sitting there

835
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:38,524
and you can't move the particles. And so what's really interesting is

836
00:55:38,564 --> 00:55:41,964
what happens is that because the particles can't move,

837
00:55:42,164 --> 00:55:45,724
but you've now flipped the direction of the magnetic field, you've inverted it.

838
00:55:45,784 --> 00:55:49,104
Something really, really unique happens, which is that the plasma

839
00:55:49,164 --> 00:55:55,304
itself reconnects internally. And so now what you're left with is

840
00:55:55,364 --> 00:55:59,284
an outside magnetic field, an electrical coil,

841
00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:03,044
and inside, the plasma, where before it was moving

842
00:56:03,064 --> 00:56:06,184
along, it's now moving internally.

843
00:56:06,504 --> 00:56:13,624
- Rapidly reversing the magnetic field, plasma self-organizes into a closed field.

844
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:16,344
What? So how...

845
00:56:16,404 --> 00:56:17,704
- It sounds wild.

846
00:56:17,764 --> 00:56:22,164
- It's, it's... Yeah. So, first of all, there's a million questions I have.

847
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:28,084
So one of them, what's rapidly? What time scale are we talking about here?

848
00:56:28,104 --> 00:56:31,744
- Mm-hmm. You have to reverse the electrical current

849
00:56:31,784 --> 00:56:37,384
faster than a millionth degree, which is a very hot gas particle, can move.

850
00:56:37,404 --> 00:56:37,444
- Okay.

851
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:40,454
- And so that means we have to do it on the order of a millionth of a second.

852
00:56:40,744 --> 00:56:41,084
- Wow.

853
00:56:41,103 --> 00:56:42,603
- We have to do it in a millionth of a second.

854
00:56:42,684 --> 00:56:43,244
- Wow.

855
00:56:43,323 --> 00:56:47,504
- And, and so in practice... this is hard.

856
00:56:47,584 --> 00:56:52,644
And it's only, we can only do it now because of semiconductor switching.

857
00:56:52,664 --> 00:56:56,404
Because we can move things, we can switch things.

858
00:56:56,464 --> 00:57:00,384
Like the transistor in every CPU in a computer switches at a gigahertz,

859
00:57:00,404 --> 00:57:04,304
that means in a nanosecond, it's switching in a billionth of a second.

860
00:57:04,344 --> 00:57:07,704
And so now, which we didn't in the 1950s when these theta pinches were invented,

861
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,644
but now we have the semiconductors to be able to do that.

862
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:12,664
- The self-organizing plasma.

863
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:16,564
Can you just speak to that? What the heck is it doing? How do we discover,

864
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:20,484
how do we understand the self-organizing mechanism, the dynamics of the

865
00:57:20,564 --> 00:57:23,064
plasma that's able to contain itself?

866
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:28,564
- So what I like to do is use an analogy here: once you've made it,

867
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:34,104
it's actually somewhat straightforward to understand. Getting to it

868
00:57:34,113 --> 00:57:37,464
is tricky, and how they discovered it the first time is absolutely

869
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:41,244
amazing. But once you've made it, it's a lot more straightforward to understand.

870
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:43,864
So it's a lot more straightforward to understand.

871
00:57:45,104 --> 00:57:48,944
In a magnetic coil, when you have a round electrical coil, you have

872
00:57:48,984 --> 00:57:52,744
electrical current flowing in that coil. And

873
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:56,424
if you have a conductor, if you have another, a metal inside that

874
00:57:56,504 --> 00:58:00,304
coil, and this is called Lenz's Law in one of the

875
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:04,104
Maxwell equations, is that as you have electrons and you have current

876
00:58:04,144 --> 00:58:08,064
flowing in that coil, an equal and opposite electrical

877
00:58:08,184 --> 00:58:12,124
current is induced in a piece of metal nearby. This is

878
00:58:12,144 --> 00:58:15,804
the same thing that happens in a transformer where you have a primary on a transformer

879
00:58:15,844 --> 00:58:19,824
and you have electricity flowing in it, and you have a secondary where electricity flows

880
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:23,554
exactly the opposite direction. We use this every day in our lives.

881
00:58:23,624 --> 00:58:27,604
And so in this condition, you have

882
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:31,124
a conductor, an electrical conductor where current can flow, and you

883
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:34,854
have an electrical current flowing on the outside, electrical current flows on the

884
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:40,004
inside. And in that case, now, I've described two pieces of metal.

885
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:44,774
Now let's go one step further and that inner conductor is not a piece of metal anymore.

886
00:58:44,804 --> 00:58:48,504
It's one of these high temperature gases, this plasma, this charged

887
00:58:48,544 --> 00:58:52,124
particles. So now you have electrical current

888
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:55,964
flowing in the plasma. This is really, really interesting. We

889
00:58:56,004 --> 00:58:59,763
talked about these charges moving back and forth. Well, moving electrical

890
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:03,524
charges is current. So in every plasma condition we've talked about, the

891
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:07,294
tokamak, the theta pinch, the stellarator, there's electrical

892
00:59:07,384 --> 00:59:10,514
current flowing in the plasma. But in the field-reversed

893
00:59:10,524 --> 00:59:14,144
configuration, you have a lot of electrical current flowing in the plasma,

894
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:18,164
massive amounts of it. And that's the key. So you have

895
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:21,813
the center core where electrical current is flowing in this

896
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:25,344
transformer, if you want to think about it, primary and secondary. And here's the

897
00:59:25,404 --> 00:59:31,404
craziest part of it. This electrical current — Well, how did I describe a magnet?

898
00:59:31,464 --> 00:59:35,454
An electromagnet is a loop that has electrical current flowing in it that

899
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:39,164
generates a magnetic field. And for a theta pinch,

900
00:59:39,724 --> 00:59:43,564
and for a mirror and for a tokamak, in that magnetic field, the plasma

901
00:59:43,624 --> 00:59:51,284
gets trapped. But in an FRC, this electrical current is the plasma. And that plasma

902
00:59:51,384 --> 00:59:54,004
plasma then generates its own magnetic field,

903
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:59,144
and it's then trapped on its own magnetic field.

904
00:59:59,204 --> 01:00:00,074
- That's fascinating.

905
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:04,064
- And that's the key. So, in your tokamak, in your donut, in your stell-

906
01:00:04,084 --> 01:00:06,154
in your funky donut, your stellarator-

907
01:00:06,154 --> 01:00:09,404
...you make the magnets and you trap your plasma in it.

908
01:00:09,444 --> 01:00:13,204
In an FRC, you make the plasma, which makes the magnets,

909
01:00:13,244 --> 01:00:16,804
and it traps itself. The craziest part of

910
01:00:16,844 --> 01:00:21,324
this, in my mind, is that we actually see this in nature all the time.

911
01:00:22,484 --> 01:00:26,152
If you look at the sun, we see solar flares. In a solar

912
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:30,022
flare, we've all seen the pictures of the photosphere of the

913
01:00:30,132 --> 01:00:33,792
sun and this large arc of plasma coming

914
01:00:33,852 --> 01:00:37,792
out. That plasma has current, electrical current flowing in it, and then we see

915
01:00:37,812 --> 01:00:40,952
this solar flare rip off of the sun.

916
01:00:41,011 --> 01:00:44,772
And that solar flare then can flow throughout and continue

917
01:00:44,852 --> 01:00:48,812
into the solar system, and for a little while anyway, it makes something called

918
01:00:48,852 --> 01:00:52,712
a plasmoid. That plasmoid is in fact electrical current

919
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:56,792
flowing in the plasma, generating a magnetic field and holding it

920
01:00:56,852 --> 01:01:00,212
for longer than it would otherwise. So, we've observed these for 100

921
01:01:00,312 --> 01:01:03,991
years, and we've known about these plasmoids for a long time, and there's

922
01:01:04,031 --> 01:01:07,922
researchers that have tried intentionally to make them. But

923
01:01:07,952 --> 01:01:11,562
fundamentally, that's what we do every day, is make one of

924
01:01:11,591 --> 01:01:15,471
these self-organized closed-field plasmas.

925
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:18,952
- in a more controlled way at this rapid rate of one-millionth of a

926
01:01:19,011 --> 01:01:22,982
second and being able to make sure it's reliable, stable, and all

927
01:01:23,011 --> 01:01:26,152
that kind of stuff. So, by the way, how do you keep the thing stable?

928
01:01:26,162 --> 01:01:29,852
- And there's the hard part, because I just described a solar flare.

929
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:33,832
But, and yes, we've seen the pictures of them, but we've also watched them, and they

930
01:01:33,872 --> 01:01:37,692
appear. They fly away from the sun, and then they go away, and that's not what we want in

931
01:01:37,712 --> 01:01:40,971
fusion, right? We want to be able to control this. That's the hard part of the

932
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:44,912
job. So, that's what we've spent the last number

933
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:50,011
of years learning how to do, ourselves and others, on these pulsed

934
01:01:50,852 --> 01:01:52,892
closed-field FRC systems.

935
01:01:52,912 --> 01:01:53,332
- Hm.

936
01:01:53,372 --> 01:01:57,261
- Let's first talk about how to make them, and then we'll talk about how to make them stable,

937
01:01:57,292 --> 01:02:01,102
because they're two different things, and we spend a lot of time on both. So, we talked about

938
01:02:01,132 --> 01:02:04,971
timescales. You have to reverse the field. You have to change the electrical

939
01:02:05,051 --> 01:02:08,772
current in a millionth of a second. So, how do you do that? So,

940
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:12,812
I've described this system as you have a series of magnets. You have a

941
01:02:12,872 --> 01:02:18,352
magnetic field on the outside, and then on the inside of this, you have this

942
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:21,792
donut, this FRC that has its own electrical

943
01:02:21,832 --> 01:02:25,781
current. We didn't talk about this yet, but it's generated a magnetic field,

944
01:02:26,132 --> 01:02:29,852
and that magnetic field has pressure, and this is the other thing that's really

945
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:33,071
interesting. We talked about how this theta pinch

946
01:02:33,112 --> 01:02:36,971
compresses a magnetic field. It applies a pressure

947
01:02:37,071 --> 01:02:40,991
on the outside. But the plasma itself has a pressure

948
01:02:41,051 --> 01:02:44,852
on the inside, and it has both a particle pressure, literally the particles

949
01:02:44,892 --> 01:02:48,181
bouncing. Think about hot gas in a balloon. The particles

950
01:02:48,212 --> 01:02:52,192
expanding, the ideal gas law expanding and contracting inside a balloon. But they also have a

951
01:02:52,252 --> 01:02:55,721
magnetic pressure. The electromagnetism is pushing

952
01:02:55,752 --> 01:02:59,612
back, and I like to think about this as the motor in a

953
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:03,082
Tesla. In your electric car, you have a

954
01:03:03,091 --> 01:03:06,252
motor, an electric motor, and what that motor has is a series of

955
01:03:06,292 --> 01:03:10,181
windings. Those windings, you flow electrical current, in this case from a battery.

956
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:13,752
Hit the gas, electricity flows from the battery into the motor into those

957
01:03:13,812 --> 01:03:17,772
windings, and it generates an electromagnetic force. A Lorentz

958
01:03:17,872 --> 01:03:21,132
force is what it's technically called. This electromagnetic

959
01:03:21,152 --> 01:03:24,812
force induces an electrical current on the

960
01:03:24,821 --> 01:03:28,772
armature, on the shaft. This is getting into the details, but in

961
01:03:28,852 --> 01:03:32,672
the armature of an electrical motor, that actually is what spins. So the

962
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:36,632
outside of a motor doesn't spin. You flow electrical current through it, and the inside

963
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:40,461
does spin. That electromagnetic force is what is spinning

964
01:03:40,511 --> 01:03:44,112
that armature. In our case, we're inducing an electrical

965
01:03:44,152 --> 01:03:48,112
force in that electromagnet, and that's putting an electrical current,

966
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:52,031
just like in the armature, into that plasma. And we can use

967
01:03:52,091 --> 01:03:55,952
that force to do interesting things. So that electromagnetic

968
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:59,571
force can compress the fusion plasma. It can expand the fusion

969
01:03:59,612 --> 01:04:03,511
plasma. But here's the problem, it's unstable. So this is something

970
01:04:03,612 --> 01:04:07,181
you learn very early in your graduate work as

971
01:04:07,312 --> 01:04:13,792
a student in fusion, is you learn about plasmas that are called high beta plasmas.

972
01:04:13,832 --> 01:04:17,812
- So I keep seeing this plasma beta thing everywhere. What is

973
01:04:17,872 --> 01:04:21,471
this ratio of plasma field energy to confining magnetic field

974
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:22,721
energy? Please explain.

975
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:26,961
- Plasma beta is the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the particle pressure.

976
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:30,591
What that fundamentally means is I talked about how you have a

977
01:04:30,632 --> 01:04:33,681
magnetic field, and in that magnetic field, plasma is

978
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:37,752
trapped on that magnetic field. But

979
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:41,761
it's not very well trapped. It can escape. It can leave either down the

980
01:04:41,832 --> 01:04:45,402
ends, it can freely travel, or it can also travel

981
01:04:45,452 --> 01:04:49,212
across the magnetic field. And so we have a term called

982
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:53,051
plasma beta, which gives us an understanding of how

983
01:04:53,072 --> 01:04:56,752
well trapped that plasma is. So, as you apply a magnetic

984
01:04:56,912 --> 01:05:00,852
pressure, a magnetic field to this plasma, it pushes back, and

985
01:05:00,892 --> 01:05:04,792
does it push back a little or does it push back a lot? And for

986
01:05:04,832 --> 01:05:08,572
a field-reversed configuration, in one of our plasmas, beta

987
01:05:08,712 --> 01:05:12,292
is very close to one. In fact, usually by definition,

988
01:05:12,471 --> 01:05:16,172
one at any point in the system, which means that every time I

989
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,962
apply a magnetic force on this donut to compress it, the

990
01:05:20,312 --> 01:05:23,432
plasma particles on the inside push back.

991
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:27,412
What's really interesting is you have an equation for magnetic pressure, which is B

992
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:30,812
squared over 2μ0. The magnetic field

993
01:05:31,252 --> 01:05:35,192
squared is the external magnetic pressure. Any magnetic field

994
01:05:35,202 --> 01:05:39,091
anywhere generates this pressure. But the plasma

995
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:43,091
particles themselves also have a pressure. This is the ideal gas law, and

996
01:05:43,131 --> 01:05:47,091
we use the definition NKT: density,

997
01:05:47,112 --> 01:05:51,091
Boltzmann constant, and temperature for pressure. And in high beta,

998
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:55,112
they're the same. B squared over two mu naught is NKT.

999
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:58,892
So for a known magnetic field, I know the density and temperature of the

1000
01:05:58,912 --> 01:06:02,261
plasma is. Just to circle back to it, when we talked about

1001
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:06,272
fusion, we talked about it having to be hot enough and dense enough.

1002
01:06:07,011 --> 01:06:10,692
And that's N and that's T. So now I have a very clear

1003
01:06:10,752 --> 01:06:14,732
equation between magnetic field and density and temperature of the

1004
01:06:14,772 --> 01:06:18,572
fusion fuel, and that's really critical. All plasmas have

1005
01:06:18,752 --> 01:06:22,662
some— all fusion plasmas have some beta, some number.

1006
01:06:22,932 --> 01:06:26,880
The FRC has one of the highest betas, beta equal one. However, what

1007
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,720
you also learn in school when you learn about beta the first time, is you

1008
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:34,600
learn that high-beta plasmas are typically unstable.

1009
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,520
And so the good way to think about this is a tokamak

1010
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,560
is an accelerator that is stable, because those

1011
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,380
plasmas that are going around in the donut, there's a force on

1012
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:50,340
that donut. But that plasma donut is very well held by

1013
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:53,460
all those magnetic fields, by all those magnetic coils. If it tried to

1014
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,060
move, it would be confined by that magnetic coil. But in an

1015
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:01,120
FRC, it's unconfined. So the plasma is confined, but the whole

1016
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,910
topology can do something that is called tilt, is that this

1017
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:08,580
whole plasma donut, because it's under pressure, can just turn

1018
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:15,870
over. The way I think about this is, think about a motor is a good

1019
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,640
example. An armature in the center of your motor, you have a spinning

1020
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:23,600
armature. You have this spinning magnet on the

1021
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,540
inside, and it is held by the main axis

1022
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,270
of the magnet. It can't go anywhere. We don't have that axis. We don't have any

1023
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:35,260
mechanical things inside these fusion systems. They're 100 million degrees. You can't

1024
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,020
put any mechanical things inside them, and so we have nothing to hold

1025
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,060
onto it, and so it's unstable. So when you learn about the FRC, that's the first thing

1026
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:47,040
you learn, and it took us a number of years to learn about

1027
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:51,070
a parameter of how to make them stable, and that's

1028
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,660
pretty fundamental, but most people who've heard of an

1029
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:58,720
FRC haven't understood this really key fact. So we have a

1030
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:02,500
parameter we call S star over E. And we're getting

1031
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,860
really into the physics weeds here, but

1032
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,600
- Let's go.

1033
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:10,640
- it's really important, and the good analogy here is a top.

1034
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,680
Literally a top, a spinning top, and so you have a top spinning on your

1035
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,410
desk. You know that it'll spin for a little while and then it will fall over. It is

1036
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,430
unstable. However, if you spin it fast enough, if you take a top and

1037
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,890
you spin it fast enough with enough angular momentum, enough angular

1038
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,760
inertia into that system, it'll stay upright even

1039
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:33,790
though it wants to just fall over, even though it's unstable.

1040
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,520
And we do the same thing in an FRC, is if you can drive it fast

1041
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,420
enough, if you can add enough kinetic energy and inertia to the

1042
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:45,359
particles, it will stay stable. However, you

1043
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,220
can do another really key thing. We are not limited now

1044
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:53,140
to having a very skinny top. We can actually make it much bigger.

1045
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,210
So the good analogy here is if you have a coin and you know you're spinning that coin,

1046
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,640
if you spin it faster and faster, it'll stay spinning longer.

1047
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,279
However, eventually it'll slow down and fall over. But if you

1048
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:07,840
had a roll of duct tape, if you had something thicker and heavier and

1049
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:11,740
longer, and it's spinning around that same axis, it'll stay spinning

1050
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,140
even longer, both because of the inertia and because of the

1051
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,840
geometry. So we have this parameter called S star over E. S

1052
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:26,560
star is the hybrid kinetic parameter which tells you how stable it is from that top

1053
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:30,399
point of view, and the E, which is the elongation of how

1054
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,160
long it is. Maybe fortuitously, thank you nature, gave us a win here,

1055
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:38,120
which is that how we make these in these long solenoids is naturally very, very

1056
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,300
these long solenoids is naturally very, very

1057
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:44,680
long. And so we can build these with a very long

1058
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:48,720
lengths, and if we can drive them fast enough and hard

1059
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,640
enough and drive the ions to move at very high velocities, we

1060
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:56,140
can stabilize against those instabilities and hold them

1061
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:00,000
stable. And so we now know we can design with a given S star

1062
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:03,900
over E parameter, we can design these for very long lives. The

1063
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,760
theory of the systems we make say that they should

1064
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,460
last for a few microseconds at most.

1065
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,300
Us and others in the field have been able to make them last for thousands of

1066
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:19,300
microseconds, thousands of times what the stability criteria,

1067
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,720
the basic criteria would tell you. And so we know now how to do this, and

1068
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,040
so we just design them with this built into them.

1069
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:29,920
- Can you explain a little bit more of the S star over E? Are you

1070
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:33,160
given that, or is that an emergent

1071
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:39,180
thing? So like at which stage, is that the result or the requirement?

1072
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,820
- It's a great question. So it is a requirement of the

1073
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,440
system, is that you must design it with this parameter in mind.

1074
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,150
- Got it.

1075
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:51,400
- The hard part is you have to design it with S star over

1076
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,300
E being satisfied the whole time.

1077
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:54,900
- Right.

1078
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:02,380
- And here's the extra trick here. S star over E is also a measure of temperature.

1079
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:02,790
- Oh boy.

1080
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:06,400
- And, and, and, yup, we're, this, it all comes back to temperature. The

1081
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:07,420
hotter you make them

1082
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:12,300
is the same thing, temperature as kinetic energy, is the faster you're spinning.

1083
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,500
So if you take your top and you spin it faster, it's more

1084
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:20,540
stable. But you gotta make it hot, and so here's the trick.

1085
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,350
How do you make something hot that's starting cold? And it has to be hot by

1086
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,340
definition, and so that's part of the challenge

1087
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,330
of what we do day-to-day, is getting to these hot plasmas, and where

1088
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:35,870
people have, other people have tried to make FRCs and not been very

1089
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:39,790
successful, is because they couldn't get it hot enough fast enough, is it fell over,

1090
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:43,680
it tilted, before it got hot. And so we spend a lot of our

1091
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:47,729
electrical engineering... In some ways, Helion is more of an electrical engineering company than

1092
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,700
a fusion company some days focusing on how to

1093
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,540
make the electronics fast enough to be able to get it

1094
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,970
hot enough soon enough that you can keep it stable the whole time.

1095
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,420
- So you're trying to reach 100 million degrees. How do you get to that temperature

1096
01:12:03,560 --> 01:12:07,100
fast? And by the way, what can you say

1097
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:11,800
to help somebody like me understand what 100 million degrees is

1098
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:15,500
like? It seems insane. What does that world look

1099
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,440
like? I guess just everything is moving really fast. Like you said, you

1100
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,080
can't put anything mechanical in there.

1101
01:12:21,844 --> 01:12:25,384
- Yeah, so a couple of key things happened. So when gas is that

1102
01:12:25,444 --> 01:12:29,224
hot, there's... We talk about the states of matter. You have

1103
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:33,204
solids, where ice, it's cold. The atoms are

1104
01:12:33,244 --> 01:12:36,884
now bound in a lattice structure together. They're held

1105
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:40,344
together. And then liquid, you've broken a lot of that lattice structure. They can move

1106
01:12:40,404 --> 01:12:44,364
around. They have some kinetic energy, but they're still pretty contained, they stay in the

1107
01:12:44,404 --> 01:12:48,154
bowl. Keep heating it, now you're in gas. And now these

1108
01:12:48,184 --> 01:12:51,964
particles are free to move around. They're bouncing off of each other all the

1109
01:12:52,004 --> 01:12:55,884
time, and you can keep heating it from there, and that's where we talk about

1110
01:12:56,224 --> 01:12:59,874
some more phases of matter. We can add a little bit more physics

1111
01:12:59,944 --> 01:13:03,724
here. We talk about rarefied gases. When we think

1112
01:13:03,784 --> 01:13:07,464
about most gases that humans interact with, they act like a

1113
01:13:07,504 --> 01:13:10,724
fluid. And what I mean by that is that they're colliding with each other so

1114
01:13:10,784 --> 01:13:14,684
often that the particles at any one place, here the air is roughly the same temperature

1115
01:13:14,784 --> 01:13:18,434
here the air is roughly the same temperature as the air here. These

1116
01:13:18,464 --> 01:13:22,353
particles are bouncing off of each other as if you've put a really hot one right

1117
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:25,544
here, it would then cool enough that all the air is roughly on the same

1118
01:13:25,584 --> 01:13:29,194
temperature. But you can be what is called rarefied, and this is like space. This

1119
01:13:29,264 --> 01:13:33,224
is where now you have particles moving around, but they don't collide

1120
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:37,184
with each other very often. And so you can have one very, very high energy particle

1121
01:13:37,244 --> 01:13:41,184
and very cold energy particle, and they may not even touch each other, but maybe occasionally

1122
01:13:41,204 --> 01:13:45,054
they bang into each other, they collide, and then they transfer energy. That's where we

1123
01:13:45,064 --> 01:13:48,914
call rarefied. And then you can go even hotter than that, and that's where now the actual

1124
01:13:48,964 --> 01:13:52,884
atomic states, which has the nucleus, which is a proton

1125
01:13:52,924 --> 01:13:56,554
and a neutron, and an electron gets so hot, that electron gets energized and

1126
01:13:56,584 --> 01:14:00,424
then escapes, leaves the system. And now they're charged. You have a

1127
01:14:00,464 --> 01:14:04,364
positive nucleus and a negative electron floating out, and that

1128
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:08,344
happens on the order of 10,000 degrees.

1129
01:14:08,384 --> 01:14:12,284
So way hotter than what we're used to. But now, we're gonna go hotter.

1130
01:14:12,294 --> 01:14:15,784
We're gonna take this plasma and go even hotter. What does that mean? At that point, a lot of

1131
01:14:15,844 --> 01:14:19,364
the way we think about temperature doesn't really apply. The idea that you have these

1132
01:14:19,374 --> 01:14:23,024
random motion of particles, because now they're all individual

1133
01:14:23,044 --> 01:14:26,524
particles moving at very high velocities. So there really is a measurement of its velocity.

1134
01:14:26,624 --> 01:14:30,104
So there really is a measurement of its velocity.

1135
01:14:31,044 --> 01:14:35,024
It's really a measurement of how fast is that particle moving.

1136
01:14:35,124 --> 01:14:39,004
And that's how I really think about temperature when

1137
01:14:39,044 --> 01:14:42,924
you get to that 100,000,000 degrees. And so it does some

1138
01:14:42,984 --> 01:14:46,654
more complex things. If you have this high energy particle...

1139
01:14:46,664 --> 01:14:50,284
This is why we like fusion. It's moving at a high velocity and there's another one moving

1140
01:14:50,344 --> 01:14:54,324
at high velocity. They will come together, they will collide, and they will fuse.

1141
01:14:54,344 --> 01:14:57,774
But other things will happen. You don't want to touch that high-velocity particle

1142
01:14:57,804 --> 01:15:01,744
with any kind of material, 'cause it will collide with that material, damage that

1143
01:15:01,784 --> 01:15:04,924
material and usually, like, blow off some chunks of that material.

1144
01:15:04,964 --> 01:15:08,944
So we don't do that. We keep those charged particles in a magnetic field. So they just

1145
01:15:09,324 --> 01:15:13,104
bounce around and they don't ever touch anything. That's really important.

1146
01:15:13,184 --> 01:15:16,964
And so it's less thinking about it from the way we normally think about hot and

1147
01:15:17,084 --> 01:15:20,724
cold, and more thinking about it from a velocity point of view.

1148
01:15:20,784 --> 01:15:26,564
- So what we should be imagining is extremely fast moving, what is it? 1,000,000

1149
01:15:27,524 --> 01:15:29,224
miles per hour? Is that accurate?

1150
01:15:29,284 --> 01:15:31,964
- That's the right kind of order for these systems.

1151
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,924
- Crazy. So you're looking for them to collide. First of all, to

1152
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:39,744
get back, is there some interesting insights, tricks,

1153
01:15:39,764 --> 01:15:42,464
anything you could say to the complexity of the problem of getting it

1154
01:15:43,664 --> 01:15:45,944
to that high temperature quickly?

1155
01:15:46,044 --> 01:15:48,324
- So, if temperature is velocity,

1156
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:53,224
that means they're moving quickly over a given amount of space. Speed

1157
01:15:53,564 --> 01:15:57,544
is distance divided by time. And so if you have

1158
01:15:57,604 --> 01:16:01,184
a machine of a certain size and it's moving very fast, that tells you the

1159
01:16:01,264 --> 01:16:04,984
time that that particle's moving from place to place in that

1160
01:16:05,004 --> 01:16:08,944
machine. And, in fact, if it's a million miles per hour,

1161
01:16:09,664 --> 01:16:13,644
these are on the order of 100 kilometers per second,

1162
01:16:13,684 --> 01:16:17,484
which you can flip that around and you can say you're moving at meters

1163
01:16:17,524 --> 01:16:21,394
per microsecond. So feet per millionth of a second.

1164
01:16:22,584 --> 01:16:25,824
And so that fundamentally tells you, and we've known this, as soon as you say, "I want to do

1165
01:16:25,864 --> 01:16:30,373
fusion," you know you need to react to the universe in microseconds

1166
01:16:31,544 --> 01:16:35,284
and be able to understand the system in that speed. And if you get it

1167
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:38,874
hotter, it goes even faster, and you have to go faster.

1168
01:16:38,904 --> 01:16:42,804
And so we look at those and that's how we think about the systems. We measure

1169
01:16:42,843 --> 01:16:46,694
everything in microseconds, not in seconds. And so when you do fusion,

1170
01:16:46,724 --> 01:16:50,924
it's pretty wild. It's literally a flash. Pshh, fusion happens.

1171
01:16:50,934 --> 01:16:54,864
And it's over. You start it, you do a lot of fusion,

1172
01:16:54,904 --> 01:16:58,824
you recover energy from it, and then you turn it off before the

1173
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,864
human eye can really respond even.

1174
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:04,874
- And there's a computer managing all this. Like, how do you even program these

1175
01:17:04,904 --> 01:17:09,034
kinds of systems to do the switching? Is there some innovation required there?

1176
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:13,004
- So I'm continuously amazed by what the pioneers in fusion were

1177
01:17:13,064 --> 01:17:16,984
able to do before the computer existed, 'cause they had to control things

1178
01:17:17,024 --> 01:17:21,004
at this scale. But maybe it was pretty hard and why we've been

1179
01:17:21,084 --> 01:17:25,004
able to be... take what they did and build on it, because now

1180
01:17:25,064 --> 01:17:28,944
we use modern gigahertz-scale computing to be

1181
01:17:28,964 --> 01:17:32,704
able to do this. And so even when I started my career, we talked about, like,

1182
01:17:32,724 --> 01:17:36,604
megahertz processors. Megahertz is microseconds. That's great.

1183
01:17:36,644 --> 01:17:40,624
You're kind of at the border of fast enough, but you can't do

1184
01:17:40,844 --> 01:17:44,744
computation at that speed if all it can do is respond in one

1185
01:17:44,764 --> 01:17:48,124
microsecond. But now gigahertz means I can do a thousand

1186
01:17:48,984 --> 01:17:52,214
operations in that one microsecond, so I can do more useful

1187
01:17:52,284 --> 01:17:56,094
things. So we use mostly... This is way too fast for any

1188
01:17:56,124 --> 01:17:59,464
human to respond to, so we use what's called programmable

1189
01:17:59,504 --> 01:18:03,084
logic. So we program in sequences to the fusion

1190
01:18:03,104 --> 01:18:07,034
system to be able to do this reversal. We pre-program it and then

1191
01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:11,044
we run a sequence and then fusion happens. And so

1192
01:18:11,124 --> 01:18:14,884
in this sequence programming language, we use a variety of them. Some of the

1193
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:17,664
fusion codes are actually written in Fortran still.

1194
01:18:17,704 --> 01:18:18,854
- Nice.

1195
01:18:18,884 --> 01:18:22,876
- And though a lot is now, more and more are run in Python. And so we do

1196
01:18:22,936 --> 01:18:26,736
a lot of Python. We do some Java, and then we also have because of the

1197
01:18:26,776 --> 01:18:29,616
speed of this, it's a lot of assembly language programming.

1198
01:18:29,636 --> 01:18:32,856
So we go right to the assembly level of the programmable logic

1199
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:36,786
FPGAs and we program those. And so to be able to run one of these

1200
01:18:36,816 --> 01:18:40,436
systems, we typically have a series of electrical switches that turn

1201
01:18:40,556 --> 01:18:44,096
on this electrical current. Those are controlled via fiber

1202
01:18:44,156 --> 01:18:48,126
optic because the wires are just too slow. So fiber optic I can respond, I

1203
01:18:48,136 --> 01:18:51,956
can send photons at the speed of light. And so those fiber optics can respond in

1204
01:18:51,996 --> 01:18:55,736
nanoseconds. And then I trigger those fiber optics with

1205
01:18:55,756 --> 01:19:00,356
programmable logic that we programmed in the hardware assembly language.

1206
01:19:00,376 --> 01:19:02,786
- As a small tangent, let me do a

1207
01:19:03,616 --> 01:19:07,496
call to action out there. I'm still looking for the best Fortran

1208
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,326
programmer in the world. If people

1209
01:19:10,136 --> 01:19:14,025
to talk to them, 'cause so many of the essential systems the world runs on is

1210
01:19:14,076 --> 01:19:17,776
still programmed in Fortran. I think it's a fascinating programming language.

1211
01:19:17,816 --> 01:19:21,216
Cobol too, but Fortran even more so. It's one of the great sort of

1212
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:29,336
computational numerical programming languages. Anyway, what in terms of the

1213
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:31,716
sensors that are

1214
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:36,255
giving you some kind of information about the system, in terms of the

1215
01:19:36,316 --> 01:19:41,346
diagnostics, like what kind, at this time scale...

1216
01:19:41,356 --> 01:19:45,696
...what can you collect about the system such that you can respond

1217
01:19:46,596 --> 01:19:47,916
at the similar time scale?

1218
01:19:49,136 --> 01:19:53,836
- So I'm also calling out for Fortran programmers, for different reasons.

1219
01:19:53,856 --> 01:19:55,036
- Yes, great.

1220
01:19:55,046 --> 01:19:58,956
- The diagnostic systems is really one of the keys to how

1221
01:19:59,016 --> 01:20:02,416
we do this effectively, because you need to be able to tell the

1222
01:20:02,476 --> 01:20:06,096
system, "We're going to trigger electrical current and we're going to do it in a

1223
01:20:06,116 --> 01:20:09,646
microsecond, and we need to know if it's working right." And

1224
01:20:09,676 --> 01:20:13,096
so in one of these FRC, or these pulsed magnetic

1225
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:17,076
systems, you won't have just one electrical switch. I've mentioned 100

1226
01:20:17,356 --> 01:20:21,256
mega amps, 100 million amps of electrical current. Even the big

1227
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:25,276
transistors we use can only run at 30,000 amps,

1228
01:20:25,356 --> 01:20:28,876
so you'll end up with tens of thousands. In fact, the systems we build now, tens of

1229
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:32,456
thousands of parallel electrical switches all operating in harmony

1230
01:20:32,476 --> 01:20:36,216
together. And so you need to be able to build a system, and this is what we

1231
01:20:36,296 --> 01:20:40,236
spend a lot of time with. And I made the joke that in a lot

1232
01:20:40,276 --> 01:20:42,226
of ways Helion's an electrical engineering company.

1233
01:20:43,576 --> 01:20:47,526
to be able to both program, control, and

1234
01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:51,336
then detect how they're operating, and do it all very

1235
01:20:51,376 --> 01:20:55,156
fast. So in a typical sequence, we will pre-program.

1236
01:20:55,216 --> 01:20:59,016
The operators will pre-program a sequence usually fed

1237
01:20:59,056 --> 01:21:03,016
from a numerical simulation of expecting how the fusion system will

1238
01:21:03,096 --> 01:21:06,956
perform. We start with a set of calculations. We then

1239
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:10,336
pre-program all of these electrical switches to a certain sequence to be able to

1240
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,636
inject the fuel, reverse it, and then compress it up

1241
01:21:14,656 --> 01:21:18,176
to fusion conditions. And then we trigger that,

1242
01:21:18,736 --> 01:21:22,666
and then let it go, and measure fusion happening.

1243
01:21:22,736 --> 01:21:26,636
But during that process, we have to be real time

1244
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:30,606
recording and measuring all of the semiconductors and all

1245
01:21:30,616 --> 01:21:34,226
of the switching in the system. I'm not going to talk about measuring fusion diagnostics.

1246
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:37,746
That's a whole other thing, which we can talk about. This is just on the electrical control side.

1247
01:21:37,776 --> 01:21:41,476
And so some of the pioneering things we've been able to

1248
01:21:41,516 --> 01:21:44,905
do is that real-time you're monitoring all of these

1249
01:21:44,916 --> 01:21:48,606
switches. You're watching who is triggering correctly, who is not

1250
01:21:48,636 --> 01:21:52,156
triggering correctly. And if systems aren't working, you're shutting down

1251
01:21:52,536 --> 01:21:55,796
this because you want to make sure that all the sequences are operating

1252
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:59,236
correctly. So, some of the key diagnostics, it's actually pretty

1253
01:21:59,246 --> 01:22:03,206
amazing that even early in my career, we didn't have

1254
01:22:03,256 --> 01:22:07,026
a lot of fiber optics built into the system. And now it's absolutely essential.

1255
01:22:07,056 --> 01:22:10,816
And so, every one of these electrical switches has fiber optic signals going into it

1256
01:22:11,016 --> 01:22:14,816
and fiber optic signals coming out, understanding how it's

1257
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:18,876
actually operating. And real-time,

1258
01:22:18,896 --> 01:22:22,836
all of these systems are being monitored by more fiber optics. We

1259
01:22:22,876 --> 01:22:26,756
call these Rogowski coils, but they're electromagnetic coils

1260
01:22:26,796 --> 01:22:30,176
that are powered by the electrical current themselves. So as the switches are

1261
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:33,876
conducting, they broadcast a signal that says, "Yes, I'm electrically

1262
01:22:33,956 --> 01:22:37,596
conducting an optical signal," fiber optics that come back to a central

1263
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:41,155
repository where we detect those signals. And so,

1264
01:22:41,176 --> 01:22:45,116
real-time, we're monitoring all of this so that we know that these systems

1265
01:22:45,156 --> 01:22:48,876
are behaving and operating at their optimal performance.

1266
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:55,006
- What's the role of numerical simulation in all of this? Sort of, I guess, ahead of

1267
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:59,016
time, how much numerical simulation are you doing

1268
01:22:59,716 --> 01:23:03,296
to understand how the system is going to behave, how the different parameters all come

1269
01:23:03,336 --> 01:23:07,276
together? The electrical system and how that all maps

1270
01:23:07,336 --> 01:23:12,176
to the fusion that's actually generated?

1271
01:23:12,216 --> 01:23:16,106
- Yeah. The operation of a fusion system is pretty fascinating because

1272
01:23:16,156 --> 01:23:19,846
all of this happens on a time scale where human operators cannot be involved.

1273
01:23:19,856 --> 01:23:27,846
cannot really be involved. And so, you have to have pre-programmed

1274
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:31,656
the majority, we call them shots. You're going to do a shot, and when you're operating them

1275
01:23:31,696 --> 01:23:35,356
repetitively and you're running long periods of time, you still have all computers

1276
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:39,396
doing both the triggering and the measuring of how they're

1277
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:42,966
performing, real-time the whole time. And

1278
01:23:43,036 --> 01:23:46,736
so, how this typically works, at least in our

1279
01:23:46,796 --> 01:23:50,076
systems, is that we will design a system with a

1280
01:23:50,116 --> 01:23:53,876
combination of some numerical simulation tools that

1281
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:57,586
we've developed based off of decades and decades of

1282
01:23:57,696 --> 01:24:01,266
amazing government programs. National programs developed these

1283
01:24:01,316 --> 01:24:08,966
numerical codes. We use a code called an MHD, magnetohydrodynamic code. And that's,

1284
01:24:09,056 --> 01:24:12,246
for people, for the engineers out there who are used to

1285
01:24:12,296 --> 01:24:16,276
CFD, computational fluid dynamics. This is very similar where

1286
01:24:16,316 --> 01:24:19,676
you take the same sets of equations actually and add

1287
01:24:19,716 --> 01:24:23,896
electromagnetic equations on top of those. And so you get magnetohydrodynamic.

1288
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:27,916
- Are you simulating at the level of a particle? Is there some quantum mechanical aspects

1289
01:24:27,956 --> 01:24:30,056
to this also? How low does it go?

1290
01:24:30,076 --> 01:24:33,816
- Yeah, we have multiple codes at different levels, because one of the

1291
01:24:33,876 --> 01:24:41,367
main computational challenges is, amazingly, even given all that we have been,

1292
01:24:41,428 --> 01:24:45,268
have built, for fusion systems, computers are still not fast enough

1293
01:24:45,508 --> 01:24:49,108
to measure, to simulate everything. And so, we

1294
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:56,138
have a number of codes that we use. One we call fluid codes, where you treat the

1295
01:24:56,748 --> 01:25:00,708
ions, the electrons, all these fusion particles. You treat them as

1296
01:25:00,808 --> 01:25:04,447
as fluids, as gases, ideal gas law, with electromagnetic

1297
01:25:04,508 --> 01:25:08,348
forces. In those, we can simulate not just the

1298
01:25:08,388 --> 01:25:12,288
fusion fuel, which is important, but all of the electrical circuitry. We talked about

1299
01:25:12,327 --> 01:25:16,248
capacitors and magnetic coils, and the electrical current and the

1300
01:25:16,308 --> 01:25:19,867
switches. We actually simulate the full thing, starting literally with a SPICE

1301
01:25:19,947 --> 01:25:23,588
model. More of that electrical engineering. We start with the SPICE

1302
01:25:23,668 --> 01:25:27,628
model and use that to drive the plasma physics model, and that's

1303
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:31,568
one level of simulation. We use that to do design work, and then also to try to

1304
01:25:31,608 --> 01:25:35,298
understand how we think the machine will run. But then we go one level deeper

1305
01:25:35,628 --> 01:25:39,248
and we start thinking about particles, and we think about the ions, and we treat the

1306
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:43,246
ions as particles, and we look at the ion behavior. For that one, the

1307
01:25:43,288 --> 01:25:46,928
computational resources are several orders of magnitude larger.

1308
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:50,888
Luckily, a lot of the work in GPUs, the AI

1309
01:25:50,968 --> 01:25:54,867
data center work is directly applicable to those simulations.

1310
01:25:54,888 --> 01:25:58,648
It's been able to speed up our work, which is pretty fascinating. That's a whole other

1311
01:25:58,688 --> 01:26:01,248
tangent we can go down.

1312
01:26:02,688 --> 01:26:06,528
Those hybrid codes we call them, particle and cell codes now

1313
01:26:06,588 --> 01:26:10,278
treat the ions as particles, and that lets us measure and

1314
01:26:10,407 --> 01:26:14,318
simulate the behavior. I mentioned the stability criteria, S star over E, the

1315
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:18,168
top behavior. That behavior, we now need these more advanced codes to be able to

1316
01:26:18,208 --> 01:26:22,128
simulate, and those are more modern. We've only been able to apply

1317
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:25,987
in practice for the last few years, actually, which is pretty fascinating.

1318
01:26:26,108 --> 01:26:29,588
The old stability rules were built off

1319
01:26:29,688 --> 01:26:33,428
of testing, empirical tests, where now we can simulate

1320
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:37,028
that, and we know why they work and how they work, and we can do some predictions on them.

1321
01:26:37,038 --> 01:26:40,117
And so, that's really fascinating that we've been able to push those boundaries.

1322
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:43,608
- And what are the different variables you're playing with? Are you still playing with like

1323
01:26:43,688 --> 01:26:47,228
topology? Like, what are the different variables in- in play here?

1324
01:26:47,267 --> 01:26:51,208
- Yeah. Each of the different simulations we analyze and use

1325
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:55,197
it to design different parts of the machine. So, at the MHD level

1326
01:26:55,588 --> 01:26:59,528
where we have the SPICE, where we actually have the circuit model, our

1327
01:26:59,588 --> 01:27:03,407
design team uses this to design the circuitry, where we're

1328
01:27:03,827 --> 01:27:07,378
designing which capacitor to use, which switch to use, how many

1329
01:27:07,508 --> 01:27:11,478
cables to use, literally to that level, how big of a cable to use. So as

1330
01:27:11,508 --> 01:27:15,428
we're doing power plant designs right now, those are the tools we're using today,

1331
01:27:15,487 --> 01:27:19,348
every day, the team is using. Then you can go one level

1332
01:27:19,388 --> 01:27:23,208
deeper and say, "Okay, let's use these more advanced computational tools

1333
01:27:23,568 --> 01:27:27,447
about stability to say, "Okay, great, but I now know the

1334
01:27:27,468 --> 01:27:31,298
circuitry, but let's look at the magnetic field topology. How do I design the

1335
01:27:31,367 --> 01:27:34,928
magnet, the shape of the magnet exactly, the timing of the magnet

1336
01:27:34,968 --> 01:27:38,947
exactly? I have to trigger one magnet, and the next magnet next to it, and the next magnet

1337
01:27:38,968 --> 01:27:42,858
next to it. How do I have that shape and that

1338
01:27:42,867 --> 01:27:46,528
design?" And so that's where you're using those more advanced tools. Now, those

1339
01:27:46,548 --> 01:27:47,888
unfortunately, those are still

1340
01:27:48,688 --> 01:27:52,108
too slow. And so, those simulations may take a day or two

1341
01:27:52,648 --> 01:27:56,447
to run. And so, an operator right now does a lot of

1342
01:27:56,468 --> 01:28:00,388
simulations ahead of time, then collects data through their

1343
01:28:00,428 --> 01:28:03,407
operations of the machines, making these field-reversed

1344
01:28:03,428 --> 01:28:07,348
configurations, going through parameter sweeps. And then the

1345
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:10,788
simulation team then goes back and looks at that data and compares it with

1346
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:14,388
simulations. I'm really excited about some of the things we're seeing in

1347
01:28:14,447 --> 01:28:18,088
artificial intelligence and reinforced learning to be able to

1348
01:28:18,268 --> 01:28:22,237
speed up that process. So we're watching and starting to work

1349
01:28:22,308 --> 01:28:26,218
on that now: can we now, rather than using it where we use it today,

1350
01:28:26,248 --> 01:28:30,068
where we do a simulation to design a machine or a

1351
01:28:30,128 --> 01:28:34,088
test, run the test, and then over the next couple of days compare the

1352
01:28:34,128 --> 01:28:38,068
testing with the simulation and use that to inform what we're going to run for the next set

1353
01:28:38,108 --> 01:28:41,968
of tests. But in fact, do it more real-time, where an operator

1354
01:28:42,228 --> 01:28:46,157
can pull up what the AI or what the machine learning would have

1355
01:28:46,228 --> 01:28:50,068
predicted it should have done. And then use that to understand what's happening

1356
01:28:50,268 --> 01:28:54,348
in the actual programs, in the actual generators themselves.

1357
01:28:54,367 --> 01:28:56,858
- All right. So there's a million questions there. So first of

1358
01:28:56,867 --> 01:29:00,638
all, how much understanding do we have about how many

1359
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:04,407
collisions happen? Can we go to the fusion?

1360
01:29:04,468 --> 01:29:08,348
How many collisions are there and how does that map

1361
01:29:08,388 --> 01:29:12,367
to the electricity? And maybe can you just even speak

1362
01:29:12,487 --> 01:29:16,228
to the directly mapping to the electricity, which is one of the differences

1363
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:20,028
between this approach and the tokamak approach?

1364
01:29:20,048 --> 01:29:23,367
- So how much fusion do you get out from these systems? And that's really

1365
01:29:24,348 --> 01:29:28,048
the right key question. So we already talked about beta, that

1366
01:29:28,288 --> 01:29:34,388
B squared, the magnetic pressure, is equal to NKT, N being the

1367
01:29:34,428 --> 01:29:38,288
density, T being temperature. And then we talked about fusion,

1368
01:29:38,327 --> 01:29:41,487
where your goal for fusion is to get particles

1369
01:29:41,528 --> 01:29:45,068
hot, high temperature, get enough of them together,

1370
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:48,987
density. And then you want to get them together long enough. We

1371
01:29:49,028 --> 01:29:52,848
call that tau. So N, T, and tau, long enough that

1372
01:29:53,188 --> 01:29:57,028
fusion happens, and a lot of fusion happens, more than any of the loss

1373
01:29:57,088 --> 01:30:00,987
rates that are happening, NTT. And in beta with B squared, you

1374
01:30:01,048 --> 01:30:04,428
know already two of those parameters, NNT, are

1375
01:30:04,438 --> 01:30:08,038
equal. And so that tells you right away the goal is to maximize magnetic

1376
01:30:08,108 --> 01:30:12,088
field, absolutely maximize magnetic field. And most folks in magnetic

1377
01:30:12,128 --> 01:30:16,048
fusion, whether it's a tokamak or it's Theta Pinch or it's an FRC, are

1378
01:30:16,108 --> 01:30:19,508
attempting to do that, maximize the magnetic field. So we're all pushing to

1379
01:30:19,548 --> 01:30:25,038
that. What's really nice in pulse systems is that we know how to do that. In fact,

1380
01:30:26,568 --> 01:30:30,228
In a pulse system, researchers in pulsed magnetic fields have

1381
01:30:30,248 --> 01:30:34,168
demonstrated over 100 tesla magnetic fields in pulsed

1382
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:37,588
magnets. That's much higher than you can get in

1383
01:30:37,728 --> 01:30:40,788
a steady magnet, or what's been demonstrated so far.

1384
01:30:40,888 --> 01:30:44,827
- Just a clarification question. So maximizing magnetic field

1385
01:30:44,888 --> 01:30:49,058
is about the N and the T, the beta? So we're not talking about tau yet.

1386
01:30:49,088 --> 01:30:53,288
- Not yet, but we need to, because that's really important.

1387
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:57,392
We can even talk a little bit further about how fusion scales. And so

1388
01:30:57,432 --> 01:31:00,892
in fusion, the hotter you get the fuel, the more fusion you

1389
01:31:00,912 --> 01:31:04,682
get. And we know that by increasing the magnetic

1390
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:08,712
field, B squared as NT, you increase density and temperature

1391
01:31:08,732 --> 01:31:12,582
together. More density, more temperature is more fusion, plus more temperature is even more

1392
01:31:12,672 --> 01:31:16,592
fusion. And so what we see is that in our, in these types

1393
01:31:16,652 --> 01:31:20,412
of systems, a scaling very clearly of magnetic

1394
01:31:20,512 --> 01:31:24,492
field to the 3.75 power, or even in a lot

1395
01:31:24,532 --> 01:31:29,452
of demonstrations, 3.77. That specific scaling.

1396
01:31:29,472 --> 01:31:33,152
That's a very strong scaling of fusion power output,

1397
01:31:33,212 --> 01:31:37,022
and fusion reactions. And so that tells you you want to go to a maximum

1398
01:31:37,072 --> 01:31:40,952
magnetic field as you can. Pulsed systems are really powerful. Pulsed systems

1399
01:31:40,992 --> 01:31:44,932
have showed when you do pulsed magnetic fields compared to a steady magnetic field,

1400
01:31:44,992 --> 01:31:48,942
researchers have shown over 100 Tesla magnetic fields.

1401
01:31:48,972 --> 01:31:52,472
Where in a steady system, people have showed in the 20, maybe high

1402
01:31:52,552 --> 01:31:56,352
20 Tesla systems. And if it's B to the 3.77

1403
01:31:56,432 --> 01:32:02,232
power, already you can see massive fusion power outputs by doing a pulsed system.

1404
01:32:02,292 --> 01:32:05,922
- Okay, got it. So we're maximizing the magnetic field. So that's

1405
01:32:05,952 --> 01:32:11,672
going number go up, super up. How do you get the duration, the tau?

1406
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:15,212
- But then I said pulsed, and pulsed already implies shorter tau.

1407
01:32:15,252 --> 01:32:15,632
- Yes.

1408
01:32:15,652 --> 01:32:18,962
- And so that is in the fusion field the name of the

1409
01:32:19,012 --> 01:32:22,852
game. Folks will have a very inertial

1410
01:32:22,992 --> 01:32:26,852
fusion. We'll have a nanosecond tau. Very short, but then

1411
01:32:26,912 --> 01:32:30,722
very high pressure. They don't have magnetic fields, but very high pressure.

1412
01:32:30,872 --> 01:32:34,792
And then in stellarators and Tokamaks, your goal is

1413
01:32:35,112 --> 01:32:38,992
very long tau, but you'll have much lower density

1414
01:32:39,272 --> 01:32:43,112
and you can't really go too much in temperature, but they'll have much lower

1415
01:32:43,192 --> 01:32:47,032
density. And so where we live in the pulsed magnetic, or the

1416
01:32:47,072 --> 01:32:50,612
magneto-inertial fusion is in the middle, is in

1417
01:32:50,652 --> 01:32:54,192
extremely high magnetic fields, increasing pressure as much as you can, and

1418
01:32:54,272 --> 01:32:57,972
then keeping them around long enough. And so that gets to the

1419
01:32:58,012 --> 01:33:01,072
tau. That gets to that energy confinement lifetime,

1420
01:33:01,172 --> 01:33:04,792
and also, it gets to stability. And so this is the thing

1421
01:33:04,912 --> 01:33:08,782
that this field-reversed configuration, which has showed that we can

1422
01:33:08,952 --> 01:33:12,812
build. These plasmas can last for hundreds

1423
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:16,752
or thousands of times the basic theory has shown

1424
01:33:16,812 --> 01:33:20,692
that now you can have long enough lifetimes. So what that means is in

1425
01:33:20,872 --> 01:33:24,692
a practical fusion system that there are lifetimes of these

1426
01:33:24,752 --> 01:33:28,632
high beta pulse systems between 100 microseconds and a

1427
01:33:28,672 --> 01:33:32,612
few milliseconds, thousandths of a second. And you hold onto it for a few

1428
01:33:32,632 --> 01:33:36,492
thousandths of a second. You do fusion, and then you exhaust it.

1429
01:33:37,492 --> 01:33:41,321
And so the whole process in this is we start with

1430
01:33:41,412 --> 01:33:48,672
a magnetic field that fills the full chamber. You then inject

1431
01:33:48,692 --> 01:33:52,202
fusion fuel. You ionize it, superheating it now

1432
01:33:52,252 --> 01:33:55,772
to a nice, cold one million degrees. But hot

1433
01:33:55,832 --> 01:33:58,672
enough that you have charged particles. You have plasmas.

1434
01:34:00,132 --> 01:34:04,072
You can then start increasing the magnetic field. You

1435
01:34:04,152 --> 01:34:07,792
form a field-reversed configuration, and then rapidly increase the

1436
01:34:07,832 --> 01:34:09,372
magnetic field further.

1437
01:34:09,392 --> 01:34:16,042
Increasing from one to five to 10, 20, to even higher magnetic

1438
01:34:16,112 --> 01:34:19,912
fields. And as you do that, the plasma heats.

1439
01:34:19,992 --> 01:34:23,872
You compress it, increasing the field and pressure.

1440
01:34:23,941 --> 01:34:27,872
Fusion is now happening. New charged particles are being born

1441
01:34:27,932 --> 01:34:31,782
inside this system with a tremendous amount of heat and energy.

1442
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:35,772
but in charged particles. This is where the beta

1443
01:34:36,232 --> 01:34:39,782
really, really works to your advantage, is

1444
01:34:39,852 --> 01:34:46,712
that just like magnetic pressure on the outside, magnetic pressure is NKT

1445
01:34:46,752 --> 01:34:47,422
compresses

1446
01:34:48,372 --> 01:34:51,952
compresses the fuel in increasing pressure and temperature. When the pressure and

1447
01:34:52,012 --> 01:34:55,732
temperature of the plasma increase, NKT increases. It

1448
01:34:55,772 --> 01:34:59,752
pushes back on the magnetic field, increasing the magnetic field

1449
01:34:59,792 --> 01:35:03,472
on the outside of the plasma, and what that does is

1450
01:35:03,512 --> 01:35:07,362
magnetic field is electromagnetic current, and current running in a wire. And

1451
01:35:07,392 --> 01:35:11,371
what that does is pushes current back in the wire. So the plasma

1452
01:35:11,432 --> 01:35:15,392
itself now pushes back on the magnetic field, pushing electrical current

1453
01:35:15,472 --> 01:35:20,632
out of the system and recharging the capacitors where we started this whole

1454
01:35:20,652 --> 01:35:21,352
process.

1455
01:35:21,452 --> 01:35:25,232
- all in a self-organizing way. So I think it's good to sort of

1456
01:35:25,292 --> 01:35:29,112
clarify how fusion usually generates energy, where this

1457
01:35:29,192 --> 01:35:33,092
intermediate step of heating up water, then the steam

1458
01:35:33,132 --> 01:35:36,972
is the thing that leads to electricity. And then, of course, the

1459
01:35:37,072 --> 01:35:41,042
FRC method that you use leads directly to electricity. I was wondering if

1460
01:35:41,072 --> 01:35:44,492
you could describe the difference between those two.

1461
01:35:44,532 --> 01:35:50,952
- Yeah. I like the analogy of the match and the campfire, and I hear

1462
01:35:50,972 --> 01:35:54,132
that a lot in fusion. Where a lot of what

1463
01:35:54,892 --> 01:35:58,362
steady fusion, think a stellarator or a Tokamak, is attempting to do

1464
01:35:58,852 --> 01:36:02,252
is take a little bit of fuel, that match, and then add

1465
01:36:02,352 --> 01:36:05,952
heat to ignite that match, and

1466
01:36:06,032 --> 01:36:09,982
then put it with enough fuel and in the right conditions and

1467
01:36:10,072 --> 01:36:14,012
hold onto it for a long time that it grows into a campfire. Even if

1468
01:36:14,032 --> 01:36:15,942
they do a good job, a bonfire.

1469
01:36:15,942 --> 01:36:19,352
It's creating a tremendous amount of energy in that steady system.

1470
01:36:19,392 --> 01:36:23,172
Burning fuel in the same place, generating some ash,

1471
01:36:23,232 --> 01:36:27,132
generating a lot of heat in that reaction. And in

1472
01:36:27,172 --> 01:36:30,972
a traditional, in a Tokamak or a stellarator, that's a lot of

1473
01:36:31,012 --> 01:36:34,932
what you're doing, is you're holding onto the heat as much as possible to

1474
01:36:34,992 --> 01:36:38,592
keep that reaction going. And the

1475
01:36:38,672 --> 01:36:42,582
optimal fuel is called deuterium and tritium, where you have...

1476
01:36:42,592 --> 01:36:46,272
Deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen where you have an extra

1477
01:36:46,332 --> 01:36:50,222
neutron, and tritium is a very rare form of hydrogen

1478
01:36:50,352 --> 01:36:54,172
that's an unstable form. It's so rare it's hard to get. Where it has

1479
01:36:54,252 --> 01:36:58,092
two neutrons and a proton, and when you fuse those together

1480
01:36:58,152 --> 01:37:01,712
at very high temperatures at very high

1481
01:37:01,792 --> 01:37:05,732
densities or high enough densities and very high temperatures they

1482
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:09,492
make helium, which is a charged particle, which stays inside the

1483
01:37:09,552 --> 01:37:13,532
campfire, inside the Tokamak continuing to heat

1484
01:37:13,572 --> 01:37:17,012
it and stoke the flames, and it makes a neutron which

1485
01:37:17,172 --> 01:37:21,162
leaves the system because it's uncharged. It has no charge, and in

1486
01:37:21,192 --> 01:37:24,712
that system, it's actually ideal. It's really great because in a campfire, you

1487
01:37:25,112 --> 01:37:28,932
have this reaction going and you want to get the energy out of it. You wanna use

1488
01:37:28,992 --> 01:37:32,072
it, and you don't want to just burn up all the fuel and do nothing. That's not really

1489
01:37:32,142 --> 01:37:36,132
valuable. What's really valuable is to stand next to the campfire and get the

1490
01:37:36,212 --> 01:37:38,572
heat, get what comes off of it.

1491
01:37:38,582 --> 01:37:42,546
And then use that in a traditional fusion system to...

1492
01:37:42,596 --> 01:37:46,296
boil water, to heat the water, and then at 30, 35%

1493
01:37:46,316 --> 01:37:50,096
efficiency, then convert that through a steam turbine into a cooling

1494
01:37:50,136 --> 01:37:53,936
tower, and cool off the fuel and extract electricity.

1495
01:37:53,946 --> 01:37:57,516
And we know steam turbines. Coal plants do this. Nuclear

1496
01:37:57,796 --> 01:38:01,716
fission reactors do this. And so we know how to do that, and that's

1497
01:38:01,756 --> 01:38:04,576
the traditional way of doing it. But

1498
01:38:05,536 --> 01:38:08,636
I think there are other ways to do it with a pulsed magnetic

1499
01:38:08,736 --> 01:38:16,096
system. There's one more thing you get to do because you have this high beta

1500
01:38:16,116 --> 01:38:20,105
where there's an electric field and an electromagnetic force that's now

1501
01:38:20,136 --> 01:38:23,536
compressing the fusion fuel. It's increasing in

1502
01:38:23,576 --> 01:38:27,126
temperature. It's getting hotter. It's increasing in temperature. Density fusion is

1503
01:38:27,156 --> 01:38:31,116
happening. New fusion particles are being born, and those particles are

1504
01:38:31,156 --> 01:38:35,016
not just stoking the flame. They're not just holding onto the campfire like in the

1505
01:38:35,036 --> 01:38:38,996
Tokamak, but they're doing another thing which is really powerful, which is they're pushing back on the

1506
01:38:39,056 --> 01:38:43,566
magnetic field. They're applying a pressure. That pressure induces a current. We can

1507
01:38:43,596 --> 01:38:45,596
extract that electrical current.

1508
01:38:45,616 --> 01:38:49,376
But it takes you into another direction, so your analogy of the campfire now

1509
01:38:49,396 --> 01:38:53,316
breaks down, because now the campfire is expanding. It's pushing back on something,

1510
01:38:53,336 --> 01:38:56,006
and so now it's the analogy of the piston engine.

1511
01:38:56,076 --> 01:38:59,996
As you move from the match, the campfire, to now pistons.

1512
01:39:00,016 --> 01:39:03,276
And so, in a piston engine, you use the motion of the

1513
01:39:03,376 --> 01:39:06,856
piston, the pressure on it and the motion of it to do something

1514
01:39:06,936 --> 01:39:10,466
useful, and in a piston engine, it's to turn a crankshaft and

1515
01:39:10,796 --> 01:39:18,986
turn a crankshaft and run a... Run wheels, or maybe even a piston engine to turn a

1516
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:21,856
crankshaft and run a generator and make electricity.

1517
01:39:21,876 --> 01:39:24,086
And in fact, you can do it pretty high efficiency.

1518
01:39:24,086 --> 01:39:27,996
and a generator using that method, using the

1519
01:39:28,036 --> 01:39:31,876
expansion of that piston, and what we do is use the expansion of the

1520
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:35,676
magnetic field to extract that electricity, and we believe you can do it

1521
01:39:35,876 --> 01:39:39,536
at much, much higher efficiencies. In fact, there have been theoretical

1522
01:39:39,576 --> 01:39:43,376
papers that show not 30 to 35% efficiency

1523
01:39:43,416 --> 01:39:46,776
like a steam turbine can do, but 80% efficiency.

1524
01:39:46,896 --> 01:39:52,815
85% efficiency, extracting much more of the energy of the fuel in that process.

1525
01:39:52,916 --> 01:39:57,316
- Can you actually just take a tiny tangent... On the word efficiency here?

1526
01:39:57,356 --> 01:40:00,665
So, yeah, so you said 30%, so it's

1527
01:40:00,696 --> 01:40:04,556
inefficient, and that efficiency measure is how much of the

1528
01:40:04,616 --> 01:40:06,896
energy is actually converted to electricity?

1529
01:40:06,976 --> 01:40:10,596
- That measure is how much of the thermal energy that gets

1530
01:40:10,656 --> 01:40:14,626
outside of the system is then converted into electricity, which is the thing we care

1531
01:40:14,656 --> 01:40:18,616
about. We want... we're not in this to make fusion. We're in this to make

1532
01:40:18,656 --> 01:40:19,596
electricity.

1533
01:40:19,636 --> 01:40:23,576
And we're using fusion to make electricity, and so from my point of view, that

1534
01:40:23,596 --> 01:40:27,256
should be the focus: how do we get to that? So that's the efficiency of that

1535
01:40:27,276 --> 01:40:31,236
thermal energy that makes it out to electricity. What

1536
01:40:31,276 --> 01:40:34,746
it is not a measure of how much energy you put into the system and what happens to

1537
01:40:34,776 --> 01:40:38,036
that in terms of you started this campfire with a

1538
01:40:38,056 --> 01:40:41,576
blowtorch. What about all that blowtorch energy? What are you getting for

1539
01:40:41,656 --> 01:40:47,756
that? And so I think that's something that high beta is one more side benefit

1540
01:40:48,576 --> 01:40:52,336
that it turns out is actually maybe the tail that wags the dog, is that not

1541
01:40:52,416 --> 01:40:56,306
only do you at high efficiency get out any of the new fusion energy, which is great, because

1542
01:40:56,316 --> 01:41:00,206
that's what you want, make electricity from fusion, but you also get to recover all

1543
01:41:00,256 --> 01:41:02,896
of that magnetic energy you put back into it.

1544
01:41:02,956 --> 01:41:06,656
And that's the really powerful one, and that's something that folks have

1545
01:41:06,696 --> 01:41:10,396
demonstrated over 95% efficiency, that you can put

1546
01:41:10,496 --> 01:41:14,116
electricity into fusion and then get that electricity back out at

1547
01:41:14,156 --> 01:41:17,756
95% efficiency, plus some very high

1548
01:41:17,796 --> 01:41:21,716
efficiency, maybe 80%, maybe higher of all the fusion product electricity

1549
01:41:21,736 --> 01:41:25,356
too. So now you're making a tremendous amount of electricity in one of these

1550
01:41:25,396 --> 01:41:28,716
systems, and that has all kinds of performance and engineering

1551
01:41:28,756 --> 01:41:34,436
benefits that are really powerful, but it also pushes you to other fuels.

1552
01:41:34,476 --> 01:41:38,445
So we talked about how deuterium and tritium fuels make this neutron,

1553
01:41:38,445 --> 01:41:41,676
which leaves the system to boil water, to run steam

1554
01:41:41,716 --> 01:41:45,656
turbines, but it doesn't push back on the magnetic field. So in one of these

1555
01:41:45,676 --> 01:41:49,576
high beta systems, it's actually not a great fuel at all, and so

1556
01:41:50,456 --> 01:41:54,096
the other fuels that are out there are even more interesting, and one of the

1557
01:41:54,156 --> 01:41:58,196
candidate fuels that's really interesting is called deuterium and helium-3.

1558
01:41:58,216 --> 01:42:02,105
And we talked about deuterium, heavy hydrogen. Well, helium-3,

1559
01:42:02,156 --> 01:42:05,696
the nucleus is also called a helion. That's why we named the company that.

1560
01:42:05,756 --> 01:42:09,196
is light helium, which is... In normal

1561
01:42:09,276 --> 01:42:13,236
helium, which is what you find in a balloon, there's two protons, two neutrons.

1562
01:42:13,256 --> 01:42:20,305
It's very stable and found commonly. Helium-3 is also

1563
01:42:20,436 --> 01:42:24,336
stable, but it's not found commonly. Fortunately, it's lightweight,

1564
01:42:24,396 --> 01:42:27,656
so it leaves. It literally leaves the atmosphere and goes into

1565
01:42:27,736 --> 01:42:31,716
space. So we don't have a lot of it here on Earth, and so you have to make it,

1566
01:42:31,796 --> 01:42:35,276
or you have to go into space, and there's a whole other thing about where do you get it?

1567
01:42:35,296 --> 01:42:38,656
Do you get it from the moon? Jupiter has, it turns out, massive amounts of

1568
01:42:38,676 --> 01:42:42,136
helium-3. But when you take deuterium and

1569
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:46,116
helium-3 and you fuse those together, you also get that

1570
01:42:46,176 --> 01:42:49,576
helium particle, that alpha particle, what we call that in

1571
01:42:49,596 --> 01:42:53,436
fusion. But instead of the neutron, you get a proton, and that

1572
01:42:53,456 --> 01:42:57,366
proton is a charged particle. It's a hydrogen nucleus. That

1573
01:42:57,376 --> 01:43:01,036
proton is now trapped in the magnetic field, pushes back, and you can

1574
01:43:01,076 --> 01:43:04,666
extract that electricity. Now, there are some prices to be paid for this helium-3 fuel. But for a high beta system

1575
01:43:04,676 --> 01:43:12,036
for this helium-3 fuel. But for a high beta system like a pulsed magnetic fusion system, that's really the ideal fuel.

1576
01:43:12,116 --> 01:43:13,416
like a pulsed magnetic fusion system, that's really the ideal fuel.

1577
01:43:14,056 --> 01:43:17,996
- When you say prices, what are the prices? What shape do the prices take?

1578
01:43:18,056 --> 01:43:22,756
What, what are the prices? What shape do the prices take? prices take?

1579
01:43:22,826 --> 01:43:28,156
- All kinds of shapes: physics, engineering, technical, and business costs.

1580
01:43:28,176 --> 01:43:32,186
And so, let's dive in.

1581
01:43:32,196 --> 01:43:35,996
So, we talked about how helium-3 is... From the fusion physics point of view,

1582
01:43:36,056 --> 01:43:39,896
from the fusion physics point of view, we talked about 100 million degrees.

1583
01:43:39,956 --> 01:43:43,026
That's the temperature that deuterium and tritium fusion works really well. And that's the temperature

1584
01:43:43,116 --> 01:43:46,867
fusion works really well. And that's the temperature that traditional fusion folks have really focused

1585
01:43:46,888 --> 01:43:50,848
that traditional fusion folks have really focused on getting to. That's the threshold.

1586
01:43:50,888 --> 01:43:54,867
When you get to 100 million degrees, you're at the operating point of fusion, and you know it works, colloquially anyway.

1587
01:43:54,947 --> 01:43:58,348
of fusion, and you know it works, colloquially anyway.

1588
01:43:58,708 --> 01:44:02,607
Helium-3 requires higher temperatures. That's not enough. Fusion happens

1589
01:44:02,647 --> 01:44:06,288
That's not enough. Fusion happens for deuterium and helium-3 at 100 million degrees,

1590
01:44:06,327 --> 01:44:09,987
degrees, but it's not its optimal temperature. And in fact, in a high beta system, the optimal

1591
01:44:10,008 --> 01:44:13,407
the optimal temperature is higher: 200, even sometimes 300 million degrees.

1592
01:44:13,567 --> 01:44:17,288
So you have to get to even higher temperatures. Temperature's hard, and so you have to push

1593
01:44:17,327 --> 01:44:21,267
Temperature's hard, and so you have to push to even higher temperatures than you had before.

1594
01:44:21,308 --> 01:44:24,867
And so that's one of the downsides. The other downside can be, as you get to those

1595
01:44:24,907 --> 01:44:27,867
The other downside can be, as you get to those higher temperatures,

1596
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:32,668
we talked about B squared is NT. B squared is density times temperature.

1597
01:44:32,708 --> 01:44:36,147
is density times temperature. Well, for a given magnetic field, density and temperature are now inverse.

1598
01:44:36,208 --> 01:44:40,147
field, density and temperature are now inverse. So as I increase temperature, density decreases.

1599
01:44:40,157 --> 01:44:44,048
So as I increase temperature, density decreases. And so now you have an issue

1600
01:44:44,057 --> 01:44:48,026
An issue of you may have less particles to do fusion, which means your fusion system

1601
01:44:48,067 --> 01:44:52,447
to do fusion, which means your fusion system has to get bigger than it was before.

1602
01:44:52,487 --> 01:44:56,107
So for the same reaction rates, a helium-3 system

1603
01:44:56,628 --> 01:45:00,808
compared to deuterium-tritium, has to operate at a higher temperature and be bigger.

1604
01:45:01,808 --> 01:45:05,668
However, the flip side is if you can now recover energy at 80,

1605
01:45:05,848 --> 01:45:09,727
recover energy at 80, at three times the energy efficiency, at 80 some percent

1606
01:45:09,808 --> 01:45:13,697
at 80 some percent versus 30 some percent, and recover all your input energy,

1607
01:45:14,227 --> 01:45:17,237
then now it's actually about the same size.

1608
01:45:17,248 --> 01:45:20,888
Because they're the same electricity output, not energy. It's not energy that we're worried about.

1609
01:45:20,907 --> 01:45:24,767
It's electricity we're worried about. Electricity output, now you can actually

1610
01:45:24,808 --> 01:45:28,678
actually build systems of similar size and similar energy. Only they're now at this much higher efficiency.

1611
01:45:28,708 --> 01:45:30,968
Only they're now at this much higher efficiency.

1612
01:45:31,008 --> 01:45:34,987
- Got it. Can you say more about size? What are we talking about here?

1613
01:45:35,187 --> 01:45:37,647
Why is size an important constraint?

1614
01:45:37,687 --> 01:45:40,508
- And that gets to one of the other prices. That gets to money.

1615
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:44,388
Our goal is we want to build clean, low-cost electricity and get it out in the world.

1616
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:48,647
low-cost electricity and get it out in the world, but that means it needs to be low-cost.

1617
01:45:48,687 --> 01:45:52,567
That's fundamental. If it's really expensive, no one's going to buy it. And,

1618
01:45:52,708 --> 01:45:56,508
while it can be clean, it's not going to be deployed. And so that

1619
01:45:56,548 --> 01:46:03,248
is always has to be a part of why, what the promise of fusion is that can be low cost.

1620
01:46:03,388 --> 01:46:09,147
So how do we know how much fusion systems cost? That's a really great

1621
01:46:09,168 --> 01:46:12,928
question. And a lot of it comes down to fundamental

1622
01:46:13,048 --> 01:46:16,607
size, that you have to just build things. And so there's some really first

1623
01:46:16,687 --> 01:46:20,567
principles, cost engineering you can do around power plants

1624
01:46:20,668 --> 01:46:24,008
for fundamentally what do they cost? How much concrete went into

1625
01:46:24,048 --> 01:46:27,857
it? Fundamentally, how big is it? And that, and

1626
01:46:27,888 --> 01:46:31,628
that if you're doing a good job of manufacturing,

1627
01:46:31,668 --> 01:46:35,647
you are, your goal is to manufacture a product

1628
01:46:35,668 --> 01:46:39,607
for as low of cost as you can so you can sell it for as low price as you

1629
01:46:39,668 --> 01:46:43,208
can. It asymptotes to the material cost.

1630
01:46:43,827 --> 01:46:43,837
- Ah.

1631
01:46:43,867 --> 01:46:45,567
- Because you never get cheaper than that.

1632
01:46:45,628 --> 01:46:49,147
- So this literally, in some sense, some sort of first principle

1633
01:46:49,348 --> 01:46:52,107
sense is how much concrete-

1634
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:52,468
- How- how-

1635
01:46:52,477 --> 01:46:54,687
- ...goes into building the power plant.

1636
01:46:54,708 --> 01:46:58,668
- How much concrete, how much steel, how much,

1637
01:46:58,727 --> 01:47:02,628
copper and aluminum. Different materials cost different amounts,

1638
01:47:02,668 --> 01:47:06,607
but at the end of the day, the cheapest function is the least amount of materials.

1639
01:47:06,668 --> 01:47:08,187
- Wow. Okay.

1640
01:47:08,197 --> 01:47:12,128
- And so that's, we think a lot about that and how we can make these systems smaller

1641
01:47:12,508 --> 01:47:16,428
so they can be developed at lower cost. Now, there's a flip side. You still need to produce

1642
01:47:16,487 --> 01:47:17,468
electricity.

1643
01:47:17,487 --> 01:47:21,208
So if you make them really small and they don't produce electricity, and there is some minimum size to

1644
01:47:21,227 --> 01:47:25,027
fusion, and that's really important. Fusion scientists and engineers

1645
01:47:25,128 --> 01:47:29,027
don't see you'd ever have a fusion generator on the back of

1646
01:47:29,067 --> 01:47:32,848
your DeLorean, for instance. The physics doesn't let that one happen, at

1647
01:47:32,888 --> 01:47:37,727
least physics as we've understood for the last, you know, 100 or 200 years.

1648
01:47:37,767 --> 01:47:41,647
- Well, there's a lot of really interesting business questions here, because you're

1649
01:47:41,687 --> 01:47:48,777
basically at the cutting edge of science, of technology, of physics, of engineering

1650
01:47:48,808 --> 01:47:54,588
trying to basically innovate into the future rapidly. How do you

1651
01:47:55,447 --> 01:48:01,548
how do you do that? Because the R&D here, the research alone is a lot of money.

1652
01:48:01,588 --> 01:48:05,268
So what's, I mean, what can you say about that? How

1653
01:48:05,288 --> 01:48:09,157
to be bold and fearless in pushing this technology into the future when so

1654
01:48:09,227 --> 01:48:14,008
much is unknown and it costs so much to just do the research?

1655
01:48:14,827 --> 01:48:24,567
- So I think about this in a couple of ways. One, the need. We look to the world and

1656
01:48:25,447 --> 01:48:29,827
we know the world needs clean,

1657
01:48:29,907 --> 01:48:36,307
low-cost, safe electricity. And just to meet our needs today,

1658
01:48:37,067 --> 01:48:40,388
and not to even talk about the needs of tomorrow or the needs of

1659
01:48:40,447 --> 01:48:47,378
AI or any of the growth that's probably coming. Just to meet today. And so, but

1660
01:48:47,407 --> 01:48:51,237
fundamental to that is it has to be a product that people will

1661
01:48:51,248 --> 01:48:55,057
buy. It has to be a generator that is making that electricity at

1662
01:48:55,147 --> 01:48:58,918
low cost. And it's got to be soon. And

1663
01:48:58,947 --> 01:49:02,878
so a lot of what I think about is how do we do those two things

1664
01:49:02,907 --> 01:49:06,888
together? And a lot of that is scale,

1665
01:49:06,897 --> 01:49:10,827
and a lot of that is thinking about... And not big scale. In fact, it's the opposite

1666
01:49:10,867 --> 01:49:14,227
of that. It's small scale. It's how do you build a product that's mass

1667
01:49:14,248 --> 01:49:18,147
producible, that you can build quickly and learn quickly?

1668
01:49:18,168 --> 01:49:22,147
And what I've found in my career at this

1669
01:49:22,227 --> 01:49:26,117
is that they're actually the same thing. And that

1670
01:49:26,647 --> 01:49:30,388
the faster you can build a thing, the faster you can learn if that

1671
01:49:30,428 --> 01:49:34,288
thing works, the faster you can now you can

1672
01:49:34,348 --> 01:49:38,107
actually iterate on that and build the next thing. And so

1673
01:49:38,168 --> 01:49:45,668
what I have spent my career building is teams of humans and a company that are

1674
01:49:45,748 --> 01:49:48,860
builders, that can build high technology things

1675
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:53,200
quickly. That if you want to do R&D, you don't want

1676
01:49:54,020 --> 01:49:57,260
large scale, multinational, complex, huge

1677
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:01,020
systems. You want to actually take the smallest thing you can build

1678
01:50:01,040 --> 01:50:04,720
that accomplishes the mission, and in fusion, there is a minimum size,

1679
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:08,720
but accomplishes the mission, and then build it quickly and build whole teams around building

1680
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:12,380
it quickly and incentivize folks to move quickly,

1681
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,000
iterate and learn. And the irony I think

1682
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,830
of one of the things that I've discovered is that by focusing

1683
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:23,740
on manufacturing, by focusing on low cost, very

1684
01:50:23,780 --> 01:50:26,420
rapid manufacturing, you actually get to do science

1685
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:30,380
faster, and at the beginning of my career, I would never have guessed

1686
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:33,600
that. I would have thought the way to do science is to make a giant

1687
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:39,870
demonstration particle accelerator somewhere. Like to make a large complex

1688
01:50:40,820 --> 01:50:44,410
science experiment is the best way to do science. And what I've found is

1689
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:48,400
actually small iterative, just building as fast as possible

1690
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:53,050
gets you there faster, because you can learn, you can build, you can iterate. You can

1691
01:50:53,240 --> 01:50:57,040
solve the problems, and then you can learn the fundamental

1692
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:00,880
physics, learn the scaling, learn the FRC, and

1693
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:04,660
the B to the 3.77 power and learn those things

1694
01:51:04,860 --> 01:51:08,720
way sooner than if you would have just started on one mega project

1695
01:51:08,980 --> 01:51:11,580
and then waited decades to get to the answer.

1696
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,240
- There's a profound truth in that, something about the constraints

1697
01:51:16,060 --> 01:51:18,700
of pushing for the simple, for the low cost, for the

1698
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:22,600
manufacturable. That pushes everything, pushes the science, pushes the

1699
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:26,540
innovation. In fact, you should maybe explain that you're, I believe, on

1700
01:51:26,580 --> 01:51:30,120
the seventh prototype. This is insane. The rate

1701
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:34,180
of innovation here is insane. Can you maybe speak

1702
01:51:34,280 --> 01:51:37,820
to all the different prototypes you went through, what it took

1703
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:41,860
to just iterate rapidly? And maybe it would be really interesting for

1704
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:45,300
people, like what can you say about the teams that's

1705
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:48,890
required to make that happen? Like what kind of

1706
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:51,980
people are required to make that happen at that fast

1707
01:51:52,020 --> 01:51:55,960
rate? And we're not talking about, like, software here.

1708
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:58,640
We're talking about everything, the full stack.

1709
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:04,180
All the way down to the physics at 100 million degrees.

1710
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:08,760
At speeds of one million miles per hour. It's insane. Anyway, so what,

1711
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:13,440
How do you iterate the prototypes, and what kind of teams make it happen?

1712
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:20,800
- So at Helion, we've- we've built seven systems. The first six were a series of

1713
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:24,780
prototypes that we built end to end that were focused on

1714
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:28,680
scaling the process of making these field- reverse

1715
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:32,680
configurations, compressing them to thermonuclear fusion

1716
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:36,560
conditions, and demonstrating that you can do fusion and then increasing the

1717
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:40,440
scale, increasing the temperature and the energy. The very first ones

1718
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:44,400
were named after beer. Actually the most successful was the inductive plasmoid

1719
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:48,400
accelerator, the IPA. And it was the first system that

1720
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:52,200
showed that the team could make these FRCs

1721
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:55,780
and hold onto them and understand some of the stability

1722
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:59,560
criteria, the heating criteria. And then we started

1723
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:03,320
increasing the field. Now, okay, great, we can hold onto one of these

1724
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:07,240
FRCs. We know how long and how to make them, but now can we squeeze on them and start

1725
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:11,180
doing fusion? Increasing in pressure and temperature. What we

1726
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:15,000
noticed is- is you know, machine after machine, we always

1727
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:18,620
used Starbucks. We were in Redmond at the time, Redmond,

1728
01:53:18,640 --> 01:53:22,480
Washington, and Starbucks cups sitting on top of the machine

1729
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,500
as the, this is the scale.

1730
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:28,440
They were too small to have a human really in the picture all the time, so the

1731
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:33,640
Starbucks cup was enough. And so then we switched to Tall, Grande,

1732
01:53:33,880 --> 01:53:37,800
venti. And then the biggest, trenta, was the

1733
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,300
biggest system that came online in 2020.

1734
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:45,280
That was a system that showed 100 million degrees and was the first system

1735
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:49,160
that did deuterium and helium-3 fusion. In fact, as far as we know, the

1736
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:53,150
only bulk deuterium-helium-3 fusion that has been done and

1737
01:53:53,220 --> 01:53:56,690
also showed the 100-million-degree fusion temperatures from an

1738
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:03,840
FRC. And throughout that time, the earliest work was government funded, government

1739
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:07,600
grants, SBIRs and other type of government grants. And- and actually the

1740
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:11,240
team involved myself and the rest of the founding team

1741
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:15,110
were really good at winning government programs, doing

1742
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:18,040
fundamental science, but moving very quickly.

1743
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,920
And there's a lot of ways to think about how to iterate and how to build quickly. I want to talk about the

1744
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:25,250
teams first, and then we can talk about some of the technology-

1745
01:54:25,320 --> 01:54:28,970
...uses to do that. But a lot of it is

1746
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:33,020
thinking about if your goal is to get the product, electricity out

1747
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:36,780
to the world as soon as possible, then you should be looking at

1748
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:40,620
everything you do towards that lens. And so that's thinking

1749
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:44,620
about the materials you choose. You want to, at every turn, choose

1750
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:48,800
commonly available materials. If you have to wait for supply chain

1751
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:52,900
for an ultra-rare material, it's gonna take you a lot more time. And so

1752
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:56,680
do everything you can to engineer a system that uses simple aluminum

1753
01:54:56,740 --> 01:55:00,680
alloys, simple copper alloys. And if you have to use tungsten, and

1754
01:55:00,700 --> 01:55:04,480
maybe you have to use tungsten in some of your systems, which is a hard-to-find alloy-

1755
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:08,460
make sure you're using commonly available thicknesses of tungsten sheet.

1756
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:12,430
You know, those kinds of engineering analyses and thought processes at every

1757
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,920
step. And that's how we built these systems, from

1758
01:55:15,980 --> 01:55:19,740
IPA to Venti up to Trenta, was always

1759
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:23,560
looking at, "How do we build systems that are easy to build

1760
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:27,600
and mass produced?" Because this is the other thing that I don't know that early in my career

1761
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:31,380
I'd have predicted is that by making a

1762
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:35,400
hundred of a thing, you can actually make it faster than if you go make one of

1763
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:40,300
a thing. And that's because when you look at our

1764
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:44,230
fusion systems, we talked about these big magnets. You could build one giant

1765
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:48,120
big, complex, hard-to-make magnet that's heavy and you have to move it around with a

1766
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:55,872
crane and requires very complex machining by ultra-rare CNCs. Or, you could then

1767
01:55:55,892 --> 01:55:59,432
make that out of a composite of 100 smaller magnets.

1768
01:56:00,632 --> 01:56:04,572
Each of those magnets now can be made on a simple machine. Each of these magnets can be

1769
01:56:04,612 --> 01:56:08,182
picked up by a human, they're light enough. They can be made and

1770
01:56:08,232 --> 01:56:12,132
manufactured and mass produced. And that's what we did. And that was

1771
01:56:12,192 --> 01:56:15,912
our whole design philosophy on these machines is, at every

1772
01:56:16,012 --> 01:56:20,252
turn, how do we go faster? A classic one

1773
01:56:21,552 --> 01:56:28,432
that still to this day I push the team on is, again, thinking about how do you move

1774
01:56:28,492 --> 01:56:35,702
fast, eBay. We buy, and I don't know that I've ever said this publicly,

1775
01:56:35,792 --> 01:56:38,692
- Oh boy, here we go. This is great.

1776
01:56:38,772 --> 01:56:40,532
- we spend a lot of time on eBay.

1777
01:56:40,692 --> 01:56:41,972
- You've got to find a way, yeah.

1778
01:56:41,992 --> 01:56:45,832
- You've got to move. And here's an example. We use a vacuum pump

1779
01:56:45,872 --> 01:56:48,412
because in these systems you've got to pull out all the air.

1780
01:56:48,452 --> 01:56:52,152
So we use a vacuum pump called a turbomolecular vacuum pump. This is a

1781
01:56:52,172 --> 01:56:55,522
commodity. This is used in a variety of particle accelerators, scientific

1782
01:56:55,612 --> 01:56:59,072
applications. There are many of them. They're robust. They last a long

1783
01:56:59,132 --> 01:57:02,632
time. They also have a very small supply

1784
01:57:02,672 --> 01:57:06,292
chain. So if you want to buy a brand new turbomolecular pump,

1785
01:57:06,352 --> 01:57:09,362
you can, and you might wait nine months from the manufacturer

1786
01:57:09,362 --> 01:57:13,122
to go make one for you and deliver it for you. But I can go today

1787
01:57:13,832 --> 01:57:17,552
and get the same model that was made 10 years ago and get it on eBay

1788
01:57:17,592 --> 01:57:21,522
today, right now. However, it might not work. Like you don't know how well it works

1789
01:57:21,532 --> 01:57:25,412
or how clean it is, or any of those things. And

1790
01:57:25,452 --> 01:57:33,272
so what we do is, you don't go to eBay to save money. It does. It's cheaper,

1791
01:57:33,292 --> 01:57:37,032
turbo pumps that are sitting in eBay right now, bring those

1792
01:57:37,052 --> 01:57:40,892
Bring those in-house, test them. Maybe only one of them meets the specifications you need,

1793
01:57:40,932 --> 01:57:45,212
but guess what? You just got a pump in two weeks instead of nine months.

1794
01:57:45,222 --> 01:57:48,452
And you got it, and it's in the door, and it's operational, and it's running,

1795
01:57:49,292 --> 01:57:50,112
and you're moving.

1796
01:57:50,152 --> 01:57:54,042
- See, I love this. I love that kind of stuff. One of the only

1797
01:57:54,052 --> 01:57:57,962
people I've really seen do that is Elon. He put together that

1798
01:57:58,032 --> 01:58:01,692
cluster in Memphis in a matter of weeks, which is nothing like that has ever been done before.

1799
01:58:01,752 --> 01:58:07,952
And this eBay

1800
01:58:08,992 --> 01:58:12,972
way is really the kind of thing that's required to make that happen, as

1801
01:58:13,052 --> 01:58:15,852
you shortcut the supply chain.

1802
01:58:15,892 --> 01:58:19,022
- And everywhere you can, you still have to deliver the working product, right?

1803
01:58:19,022 --> 01:58:19,132
- Right.

1804
01:58:19,152 --> 01:58:21,812
- That is, you cannot sacrifice the quality. But

1805
01:58:23,292 --> 01:58:27,122
do you really need the shiny brand-new one when the used one is

1806
01:58:27,152 --> 01:58:30,941
going to do the job? And we think about that across the board.

1807
01:58:30,972 --> 01:58:34,792
Do we take the best plasma diagnostic, the most sophisticated

1808
01:58:34,872 --> 01:58:41,172
plasma diagnostic in the world that is 3%, that has an accuracy of within

1809
01:58:41,332 --> 01:58:45,252
3%? And it's going to take me three years and maybe a few million

1810
01:58:45,272 --> 01:58:48,872
dollars to go build? Or do I take a technology from 10 years

1811
01:58:48,912 --> 01:58:52,782
ago that's 5% accurate, that's good enough, that I

1812
01:58:52,792 --> 01:58:56,672
can go build in a month? And the answer for us, at

1813
01:58:56,712 --> 01:59:00,692
Helion and for the team that we've put together, is that scrappy,

1814
01:59:00,712 --> 01:59:03,332
"I want to just solve the problem. I don't need necessarily the best

1815
01:59:03,372 --> 01:59:07,192
solution, but let's go make it

1816
01:59:07,232 --> 01:59:10,992
happen." And so that's something that we routinely do. I think sometimes I have

1817
01:59:11,012 --> 01:59:14,902
challenges with my academic colleagues on this, is that we have

1818
01:59:14,902 --> 01:59:18,052
a difference of opinion. Because that 3%, well, that's way better than 5%.

1819
01:59:18,092 --> 01:59:22,022
So shouldn't you do that? You'll know your data better. But 5% is good enough.

1820
01:59:22,032 --> 01:59:25,632
Now, 50% would not be good enough. And so that

1821
01:59:25,792 --> 01:59:29,232
technology wouldn't have been applicable. And so finding that middle ground

1822
01:59:29,692 --> 01:59:33,441
is a hard thing to do, and never compromising on the quality and the

1823
01:59:33,472 --> 01:59:40,132
safety. Like, it's got to work and it's got to be safe. But can you still go fast?

1824
01:59:40,172 --> 01:59:45,592
- But in general, just having a culture of pushing the rate of iterations here.

1825
01:59:45,612 --> 01:59:48,142
- Mm-hmm. And building the team that wants to go build things.

1826
01:59:48,152 --> 01:59:51,912
Everyone at Helion, or at least the vast majority of Helion,

1827
01:59:52,072 --> 01:59:55,872
we hire engineers, scientists and technicians and

1828
01:59:55,912 --> 01:59:59,772
machinists are hands-on builders. The company at Helion

1829
01:59:59,812 --> 02:00:06,252
is very weird for a fusion company. Today, we are 50% technicians, not scientists.

1830
02:00:06,352 --> 02:00:06,812
- Nice.

1831
02:00:06,892 --> 02:00:10,752
- And we have a ton of scientists, because the science is critically important too,

1832
02:00:10,792 --> 02:00:15,492
but they're supported by a huge manufacturing company.

1833
02:00:15,572 --> 02:00:19,432
And our goal is to build as fast as possible. Some of the other things we try to

1834
02:00:19,452 --> 02:00:23,212
do there, vertically integrate. And this is to your point on Elon

1835
02:00:23,272 --> 02:00:26,732
Musk, this is one of the things he's focused on at his companies, has been

1836
02:00:27,372 --> 02:00:31,342
how do you bring inside the critical things that

1837
02:00:31,372 --> 02:00:35,322
are going to drive timelines, the things you can't just go buy as a commodity

1838
02:00:35,372 --> 02:00:39,362
product and get it here soon, and make sure that you can go build those fast.

1839
02:00:39,372 --> 02:00:42,672
And so we've done now a number of key vertical, integrated

1840
02:00:42,712 --> 02:00:46,612
manufacturing lines at Helion. I think we may be the

1841
02:00:46,672 --> 02:00:50,592
only fusion company with a conveyor belt. Actually, our second one just

1842
02:00:50,612 --> 02:00:54,512
came online now, where we literally have our production

1843
02:00:54,572 --> 02:00:58,492
line manufacturing power supplies at Helion, so

1844
02:00:58,512 --> 02:01:01,072
that we can move at maximum velocity, rather than

1845
02:01:01,872 --> 02:01:05,972
finding an external consultant or an external supplier to go do those.

1846
02:01:06,072 --> 02:01:10,032
- Well, I love it. Builder-first company, and you're also

1847
02:01:10,052 --> 02:01:11,612
thinking about manufacturing...

1848
02:01:11,672 --> 02:01:16,032
...throughout all of this. I'm looking at the photo of Trenta. It's beautiful.

1849
02:01:16,092 --> 02:01:20,072
- And you can actually, I can point out on this picture one perfect

1850
02:01:20,132 --> 02:01:23,522
example of what I'm talking about. So on the end

1851
02:01:23,772 --> 02:01:27,692
is a green structure, green fiberglass. This is called

1852
02:01:27,792 --> 02:01:31,752
G10. Actually, ironically, one of the main structural elements

1853
02:01:31,812 --> 02:01:36,932
we use is this G10 fiberglass material. It's the same thing that's in PCB boards.

1854
02:01:36,952 --> 02:01:40,792
It's the same substrate that's in every circuit board. And so we know it's

1855
02:01:40,892 --> 02:01:44,812
strong, it's good with electricity, only we get big

1856
02:01:44,892 --> 02:01:48,672
pieces of it and machine it. But even in the end, you can see the bolts

1857
02:01:48,752 --> 02:01:52,312
halfway through. There's nine bolts in the middle there.

1858
02:01:52,492 --> 02:01:56,472
The standard piece of G10 was not big enough to fit the end of the

1859
02:01:56,492 --> 02:02:00,202
machine, and so we could have had one custom manufacturer

1860
02:02:00,332 --> 02:02:04,032
manufacture a brand-new piece of a custom size, build a new

1861
02:02:04,112 --> 02:02:07,992
mold and a new machine. It would have taken, I don't remember anymore now, but probably

1862
02:02:08,052 --> 02:02:11,872
on the order of, usually these are about six to 12 months. Or I could

1863
02:02:11,912 --> 02:02:15,312
go to a supplier off the shelf, have that delivered in a

1864
02:02:15,332 --> 02:02:18,732
week, and now machine it with all the bolts in between.

1865
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:22,720
And then in-house, have the G10 machine shop that

1866
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:26,709
can now machine the bolt holes, to actually bolt those pieces together. And

1867
02:02:26,740 --> 02:02:30,250
so that's, that took extra engineering and having really clever and

1868
02:02:30,380 --> 02:02:34,360
brilliant mechanical and structural engineers to figure out how to do that and still meet the

1869
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:38,360
needs of the fusion system. But that's what we

1870
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:42,350
tried. That's the kinds of teams we try to build at Helion, is folks that

1871
02:02:42,400 --> 02:02:46,250
want to really get their hands dirty, get hands-on,

1872
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:49,850
build things, move quickly. And everywhere you

1873
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:53,740
can, without sacrificing quality or safety, take shortcuts. That's the

1874
02:02:53,779 --> 02:02:57,060
name of the game. We've got to get fusion online as soon as possible.

1875
02:02:57,420 --> 02:03:01,400
- Yeah, this is really exciting and really inspiring. So, I have to ask then,

1876
02:03:01,420 --> 02:03:08,360
what timeline do you think, like first working, out there, nuclear fusion power

1877
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:10,040
plant? When do you think?

1878
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,040
- Yeah, so what we've been able to do is

1879
02:03:13,080 --> 02:03:16,900
build, rapidly build, every few years, bring a new fusion

1880
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:20,880
system online. In 2023, we signed a

1881
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:24,860
deal with Microsoft to build a power plant for Microsoft, for one of

1882
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:28,620
their data centers. And this is a power plant that is plugged into the

1883
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:32,500
grid, generating electricity from fusion. And

1884
02:03:32,740 --> 02:03:36,680
with a very, very tough ambitious timeline of 2028 for

1885
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:38,860
the first electrons from that power plant.

1886
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:43,200
- And that power plant will be powering a data center.

1887
02:03:43,240 --> 02:03:47,210
- That power plant will be powering the grid that the data center is plugged into.

1888
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:51,030
And we can get into the details of how the power grid works.

1889
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:55,300
But yes, so Microsoft will be buying the power from that power plant.

1890
02:03:55,320 --> 02:03:58,820
- Props to Microsoft for creating a hard deadline. I love it.

1891
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,060
- They are. They are. And it is daily that we think about that

1892
02:04:02,100 --> 02:04:05,910
deadline. We had been working with them

1893
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,760
on and off through all of those machines, through Grande, Venti,

1894
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:12,720
Trenta. So they had seen us build, hit

1895
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:16,120
milestones, show that we can do fusion, scale up by orders of

1896
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:20,160
magnitude, and then access these advanced fusion fuels. So they had seen

1897
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:24,080
all of those things and seen the manufacturing we built.

1898
02:04:24,090 --> 02:04:28,080
We're already, right now, building the manufacturing to

1899
02:04:28,120 --> 02:04:31,390
support that power plant. We're doing that today.

1900
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:35,840
We started two years ago on doing the work around

1901
02:04:35,860 --> 02:04:39,810
siting, around the interconnects. How do you plug fusion in?

1902
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:43,800
What does it look like? How do you site it? What are the environmental

1903
02:04:43,840 --> 02:04:47,750
consequences? Who's gonna regulate it? All of those things. So we spent a lot

1904
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:51,509
of time already and we're on our way, and it's gonna be hard. No joke about it.

1905
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:54,960
This is tough, and it's something that I think about every day.

1906
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:58,840
- I'm sure you've had a bunch of people probably still tell you that this is a

1907
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:02,600
pipe dream. Like, this is impossible. Are there days that you and the team

1908
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:06,900
think that this is indeed impossible? Then you wake up the next day and

1909
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,020
you're like, "All right, we're gonna do it anyway."

1910
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:11,710
- I mean, that's the thought process. That's the mentality. We're gonna do it

1911
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:15,560
anyway, let's go do it. The world needs it. There's no physics reason this can't be done.

1912
02:05:15,620 --> 02:05:19,440
Now it's a question of how fast can you build it? And can you engineer it

1913
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:22,200
to be as efficient as it needs to be? And those are

1914
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:27,720
engineering and manufacturing are ridiculously hard challenges. So do not

1915
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:31,690
short sell that. But that's the goal, and that's what we get up every

1916
02:05:31,760 --> 02:05:35,540
day thinking about. This is something I was actually just thinking about and talking

1917
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:37,560
with some of my team in the last few days.

1918
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:43,560
We certainly have people that say, "No, this can never be done."

1919
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:48,020
And we had that before. We had that at the very

1920
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:51,320
beginning of, "I want to go merge these plasmas

1921
02:05:51,380 --> 02:05:54,789
together," and folks said, "Nope, that can never happen."

1922
02:05:55,360 --> 02:05:59,340
And we went off and did it. And, "You can't compress an FRC because it's unstable."

1923
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:03,400
In fact, I actually still hear that, "FRCs are unstable." And I

1924
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:07,200
say, "Yes, I know. Now let me introduce you to S* over E,

1925
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:11,069
and 20 years of studies on what we know about that and how we can

1926
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:14,860
combat that." And so we've been able to show, through lots of

1927
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:18,760
skepticism that we can still build and iterate. And there are things I don't know.

1928
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:22,660
Let's just be totally honest. As we're going to go build these things, we're gonna

1929
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:26,849
new hard problems. If we're not doing our job,

1930
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:30,700
if we're not discovering new hard problems, we probably didn't push hard enough.

1931
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:37,680
We probably didn't push fast enough. And I think that's really critical.

1932
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:41,759
That we build the team and we do the hiring

1933
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:45,660
to make sure that everybody is doing their problem. Now that doesn't mean it's

1934
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:49,600
not a hard challenge, and to keep folks motivated. Helion

1935
02:06:49,610 --> 02:06:55,580
now is over 500 people. But when we built Trenta, we were 50 people.

1936
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:55,870
- Okay.

1937
02:06:56,280 --> 02:07:03,160
- So now there's, you know, over 300 humans working at Helion that didn't see us

1938
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:07,760
build a system from a computer model, bring it

1939
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:11,720
online and do fusion with it. But even

1940
02:07:11,780 --> 02:07:15,240
already for Polaris, there are lots of humans that started

1941
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:19,700
for our seventh generation system. When we were running Trenta, doing

1942
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:23,240
fusion, you know, they were able to see that, see the measurements, know we were doing

1943
02:07:23,260 --> 02:07:27,220
fusion. But yet, this next machine was just a simulation.

1944
02:07:27,260 --> 02:07:30,550
And so, seeing that get built, seeing that, like, it's just

1945
02:07:30,620 --> 02:07:34,450
awe-inspiring for folks. And I'll tell you, the first time that it comes

1946
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:37,700
online and flashes pink and you see that fusion

1947
02:07:37,780 --> 02:07:41,420
glow, it's awe-inspiring. It's awe-inspiring.

1948
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:41,940
- I love that.

1949
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:42,390
- I've...

1950
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:44,520
- The fusion glow, yeah. Yeah.

1951
02:07:44,540 --> 02:07:48,360
- Everybody changes their Windows desktop backgrounds to the

1952
02:07:48,380 --> 02:07:50,610
fusion background, the plasma glow.

1953
02:07:50,620 --> 02:07:52,930
- So how can you actually see it?

1954
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:56,720
- A couple of things. So one, to get access to it, we have windows.

1955
02:07:56,760 --> 02:08:00,690
We have small windows all the way around that we look into with cameras,

1956
02:08:00,860 --> 02:08:04,660
spectroscopy, lasers, other kinds of scientific diagnostics that we use to

1957
02:08:04,700 --> 02:08:09,740
measure. And so you see the light emission through that.

1958
02:08:09,760 --> 02:08:11,750
But also, it's very bright.

1959
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:15,590
And so, the actual vacuum vessels themselves that we use are

1960
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:19,552
ceramic. There are some versions of silicon

1961
02:08:19,572 --> 02:08:22,992
and oxygen, typically quartz, but there's also some other sintered

1962
02:08:23,052 --> 02:08:26,932
materials. And it's so bright that they can shine through those

1963
02:08:26,952 --> 02:08:30,672
materials, and so what you see is the light of not fusion. When

1964
02:08:30,712 --> 02:08:34,632
fusion's happening, thermonuclear fusion is so hot that the light is in the

1965
02:08:34,892 --> 02:08:38,812
X-ray spectrum, and the human eye can't see that. But

1966
02:08:38,892 --> 02:08:42,702
as your ice-cold, one million-degree plasma, when you're just

1967
02:08:42,712 --> 02:08:46,672
getting started, it's emitting photons in a range and light in a range

1968
02:08:46,692 --> 02:08:51,332
that humans can see. And so you see that bright, purple, fuchsia color.

1969
02:08:51,372 --> 02:08:54,892
- And this would be, if you're doing actual cameras, this would be like extremely high-speed

1970
02:08:54,972 --> 02:08:56,712
cameras, that kind of thing?

1971
02:08:56,752 --> 02:09:00,532
- We have high-speed ones and low-speed ones. The traditional SLR

1972
02:09:00,572 --> 02:09:04,302
cameras, which are the ones that represent the right color,

1973
02:09:04,332 --> 02:09:08,212
all they catch is the light, the integrated light, the flash.

1974
02:09:08,292 --> 02:09:12,252
They don't know, they can't see the plasma forming,

1975
02:09:12,312 --> 02:09:16,202
accelerating, compressing. They can't see any of those things.

1976
02:09:16,232 --> 02:09:19,712
They just see all of it integrated into one bright flash. But the high-speed

1977
02:09:19,752 --> 02:09:23,472
cameras, they can see that. And so the high-speed cameras we can use to actually

1978
02:09:23,532 --> 02:09:27,112
measure that. In fact, we put special filters on them to measure different

1979
02:09:27,172 --> 02:09:30,932
wavelengths of light, so we can tell, is it the hydrogen? Is it the

1980
02:09:31,012 --> 02:09:34,912
helium? Is it the helium-3? Who's emitting the light? When are

1981
02:09:34,932 --> 02:09:38,592
they emitting? What particles are emitting the light and when?

1982
02:09:38,992 --> 02:09:42,842
And so, by using those advanced diagnostics, we can now take movies of that.

1983
02:09:43,012 --> 02:09:46,772
Though it's not as great as just seeing that flash.

1984
02:09:46,872 --> 02:09:50,812
- Yeah, I mean, it's beautiful, right, that human beings are able to create something like that.

1985
02:09:50,872 --> 02:09:54,472
It's truly beautiful. Just out of curiosity, are there some

1986
02:09:54,532 --> 02:09:58,472
interesting intricacies connecting nuclear fusion power plant

1987
02:09:58,552 --> 02:10:03,472
to the power grid? Like, are there some constraints to the old-schoolness

1988
02:10:04,432 --> 02:10:08,352
of the power grid in, let's say, in the United States? How do you get that-

1989
02:10:08,392 --> 02:10:12,292
that Microsoft thing you mentioned, how do you get from the nuclear

1990
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:17,372
fusion power plant to a computer with some GPUs?

1991
02:10:17,432 --> 02:10:20,342
How do we make that connection? Or is that a trivial thing?

1992
02:10:20,412 --> 02:10:21,572
- None of this is trivial.

1993
02:10:22,912 --> 02:10:26,492
But there are, I think, simple ways, and there are some really

1994
02:10:26,552 --> 02:10:33,842
interesting engineering ways to do this. So, just from the fundamental basics,

1995
02:10:34,152 --> 02:10:37,892
as we're doing fusion, we push back on the magnetic field. We

1996
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:41,601
recharge these capacitors that started where the electricity

1997
02:10:41,672 --> 02:10:45,572
started from. And that electricity then sits on a capacitor at

1998
02:10:45,612 --> 02:10:52,352
high voltage, DC voltage, that's steady. At that point, it's reasonably easy to

1999
02:10:52,372 --> 02:10:56,352
make 60 hertz power, make traditional AC power. It's the same way as

2000
02:10:56,392 --> 02:11:00,312
you can take electricity in a battery and use an inverter and just invert that to

2001
02:11:00,352 --> 02:11:04,072
AC power. And large-scale grid inverters, we know how to do pretty

2002
02:11:04,152 --> 02:11:08,072
well. One of the sort of unique things about a

2003
02:11:08,152 --> 02:11:12,092
pulsed version of this, because it's pulsed and a repetition rate between

2004
02:11:12,172 --> 02:11:16,292
one and ten times a second, we can adjust the power output.

2005
02:11:16,302 --> 02:11:20,132
And so as the grid needs more power, we can actually dial it up and

2006
02:11:20,172 --> 02:11:24,052
down. And we've been able to demonstrate that with our fusion systems. The smaller ones,

2007
02:11:24,092 --> 02:11:27,992
the smaller plasma systems, we've gone from zero, from off,

2008
02:11:28,012 --> 02:11:31,132
to all the way to 100 times a second, and shown we can do 100 hertz

2009
02:11:31,192 --> 02:11:35,052
operation. In fact, that system we ran for over a billion operations, and

2010
02:11:35,092 --> 02:11:36,572
just ran it steady all day long.

2011
02:11:36,632 --> 02:11:39,652
- So each individual pulse is independent in some sense.

2012
02:11:39,712 --> 02:11:43,272
- Each individual pulse is different. Where you put in your fuel, you do fusion, you

2013
02:11:43,312 --> 02:11:44,152
exhaust it...

2014
02:11:44,172 --> 02:11:44,332
- Cool

2015
02:11:44,712 --> 02:11:48,432
- ...through those pumps from eBay, and then

2016
02:11:48,512 --> 02:11:50,852
and then power output and electricity output.

2017
02:11:50,862 --> 02:11:51,712
- Oh, wow.

2018
02:11:51,732 --> 02:11:55,452
- But there's probably some more clever ways to do this, and when we

2019
02:11:55,512 --> 02:11:58,932
founded Helion, the goal was to build low-cost baseload

2020
02:11:59,152 --> 02:12:02,982
electricity. And what we started to see working with Microsoft,

2021
02:12:02,982 --> 02:12:06,612
working with others now, that data centers are going to be one of the

2022
02:12:06,632 --> 02:12:10,541
biggest power needs in the future. We know that's coming

2023
02:12:10,592 --> 02:12:14,752
up. And what's really unique is that power in this form is direct

2024
02:12:15,592 --> 02:12:19,012
recovery, not the steam turbine part, but direct electricity

2025
02:12:19,132 --> 02:12:23,032
is already DC, which is steady, which is

2026
02:12:23,092 --> 02:12:26,792
what computers really want anyway. So are there really unique

2027
02:12:26,802 --> 02:12:30,682
ways to take DC power sitting on this capacitor, and rather

2028
02:12:30,692 --> 02:12:34,272
than going AC to the grid and having all these transmission

2029
02:12:34,332 --> 02:12:37,872
losses, just going direct DC to the data center? Can you plug right

2030
02:12:37,951 --> 02:12:41,612
in? And so that's some of the things that my team is looking at now,

2031
02:12:41,932 --> 02:12:45,912
is, can you do that direct DC conversion at super

2032
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:49,852
high efficiencies and run those GPUs directly? That would be

2033
02:12:49,952 --> 02:12:53,932
really powerful if we could figure out how to do it. But those are some of the things that I think

2034
02:12:53,972 --> 02:12:57,832
there might be some unique ways that fusion and data centers

2035
02:12:57,872 --> 02:13:01,812
can really couple together. There's a whole cooling part to it too.

2036
02:13:01,832 --> 02:13:05,492
Most of my cooling is cooling semiconductors and cooling power switching,

2037
02:13:05,512 --> 02:13:08,492
just like a data center. So there's a lot of interesting

2038
02:13:08,532 --> 02:13:11,452
engineering ways that we can bring those two together.

2039
02:13:11,472 --> 02:13:15,332
- So a deeper integration between the

2040
02:13:15,372 --> 02:13:19,202
power plant and the thing that it's powering. And it does

2041
02:13:19,252 --> 02:13:26,392
seem like the future, quite possibly, a lot of the energy that's needed

2042
02:13:27,412 --> 02:13:32,972
will be for compute, for AI-related applications.

2043
02:13:33,552 --> 02:13:37,162
So if you just look out into the future 10, 20, 50 years from

2044
02:13:37,232 --> 02:13:41,212
now, do you see nuclear fusion as a thing that powers

2045
02:13:41,252 --> 02:13:44,762
these gigantic data centers of millions of GPUs? Just

2046
02:13:44,792 --> 02:13:47,912
basically, the surface of the Earth

2047
02:13:48,972 --> 02:13:55,612
covered in compute and nuclear fusion power plants. Maybe that's 100 years out.

2048
02:13:55,672 --> 02:13:59,132
- So when I talk to AI experts, they

2049
02:13:59,192 --> 02:14:03,182
talk pretty routinely about the power needs for AI.

2050
02:14:03,212 --> 02:14:06,932
And in fact, in the same way in manufacturing that the

2051
02:14:07,012 --> 02:14:11,132
cost of any one thing asymptotes to the raw material,

2052
02:14:12,192 --> 02:14:16,612
for AI, the cost of computation asymptotes to the power

2053
02:14:16,622 --> 02:14:20,072
to the cost of the electricity. And even more, that electricity's concentrated.

2054
02:14:20,112 --> 02:14:23,872
It's in that AI data center, that brain where all the power is,

2055
02:14:23,932 --> 02:14:27,912
where all the power is, and you really want a lot

2056
02:14:27,952 --> 02:14:32,262
of high-energy density. You want power generation right there

2057
02:14:32,262 --> 02:14:35,672
on site. So it seems like, take those two

2058
02:14:35,692 --> 02:14:39,672
facts, a really nice match between fusion, which is base

2059
02:14:39,752 --> 02:14:43,512
load, high energy density, can be sited most places,

2060
02:14:43,612 --> 02:14:47,372
and a data center, which is going to be high energy requirements

2061
02:14:47,592 --> 02:14:51,542
in a local location, and large amounts of it.

2062
02:14:51,572 --> 02:14:54,952
There's been predictions recently from energy institutes

2063
02:14:55,432 --> 02:14:59,232
that suggest we will have growth that, rather than a 2% growth

2064
02:14:59,252 --> 02:15:02,432
per year in electricity, may be a 4 or a 6% growth in

2065
02:15:02,452 --> 02:15:06,292
electricity due to data center use. I think that is probably

2066
02:15:06,392 --> 02:15:13,672
wildly underestimating where we're moving. And so,

2067
02:15:13,772 --> 02:15:14,692
- Oh, man.

2068
02:15:14,732 --> 02:15:20,582
- And so the idea that AI can grow human cognition,

2069
02:15:20,612 --> 02:15:22,452
and our ability to solve problems,

2070
02:15:23,692 --> 02:15:27,542
we can't let it be limited by power. And so I'm going to push as hard as I

2071
02:15:27,632 --> 02:15:30,152
can so that that's not the limit.

2072
02:15:30,172 --> 02:15:32,912
- Do you ever think about, like, 2050 or something like that?

2073
02:15:33,092 --> 02:15:39,012
I know you're focused on a few years out, just getting

2074
02:15:39,292 --> 02:15:43,112
a fusion power plant working. But do you ever think about, like, even longer term

2075
02:15:43,212 --> 02:15:48,072
future? By what year do you think there'll be over 1000

2076
02:15:49,032 --> 02:15:50,552
nuclear fusion power plants?

2077
02:15:50,692 --> 02:15:55,762
- So I tell the team that if we demonstrate fusion one time,

2078
02:15:56,812 --> 02:15:58,512
and that's it, then we failed.

2079
02:15:59,632 --> 02:16:04,072
But that's not enough. The universe is powered by fusion. Humans

2080
02:16:04,872 --> 02:16:08,312
need to be harnessing this, and can harness this

2081
02:16:09,592 --> 02:16:13,352
for our society, for the good of society, for the good of

2082
02:16:13,372 --> 02:16:17,232
technology. And so that's something that we push

2083
02:16:17,272 --> 02:16:23,472
towards. And in fact, it's baked into how we design these machines.

2084
02:16:23,512 --> 02:16:26,672
Coils are mass produced. Capacitors are mass produced, and we make

2085
02:16:26,712 --> 02:16:29,852
them all. All across the board is thinking

2086
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:33,252
about not what the next system's going to be, but making sure we're

2087
02:16:33,272 --> 02:16:36,962
building the manufacturing and the infrastructure to build all those systems.

2088
02:16:37,012 --> 02:16:40,932
So we had a call from the White House a

2089
02:16:40,972 --> 02:16:44,271
number of years ago for the Bold Decadal Study in

2090
02:16:44,352 --> 02:16:47,892
Fusion of how do we get fusion? And it was Helion and a variety of other companies

2091
02:16:47,932 --> 02:16:51,611
from the fusion industry.

2092
02:16:51,632 --> 02:16:55,772
And it's pretty awesome to be able to say there's a fusion industry now. It's not

2093
02:16:55,781 --> 02:16:59,531
just a one-off thing, or there's a fusion experiment, or somebody has a prototype.

2094
02:16:59,552 --> 02:17:04,871
But like, there's an industry. That Helion has competitors. That's great.

2095
02:17:04,912 --> 02:17:08,852
- I've never heard anyone so excited to have competitors. But yes, that's

2096
02:17:08,892 --> 02:17:12,201
like a serious thing. That's a real possibility. Yeah.

2097
02:17:12,201 --> 02:17:15,941
- And the goal was how do we not just demonstrate fusion in the next

2098
02:17:15,992 --> 02:17:19,531
decade, but meaningfully deploy it and start to

2099
02:17:19,632 --> 02:17:25,572
answer... We have 4000 gigawatts of installed fossil fuel capacity.

2100
02:17:25,592 --> 02:17:29,492
How do we start replacing that with fusion in a meaningful way? And how do we

2101
02:17:29,531 --> 02:17:32,052
get to not just making a generator

2102
02:17:32,992 --> 02:17:36,932
every few years? But we want a factory, a Gigafactory of these

2103
02:17:36,972 --> 02:17:40,312
fusion generators rolling off the line, one a month, one a

2104
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:43,812
week, one a day? That's the kind of

2105
02:17:43,852 --> 02:17:47,732
plans that I task my supply chain team with. Like,

2106
02:17:47,772 --> 02:17:51,152
how do you do this? How do we actually go build this? How do we go build a

2107
02:17:51,191 --> 02:17:55,031
Gigafactory so we can have 50-megawatt generators coming off the

2108
02:17:55,072 --> 02:17:58,371
line, being deployed on a truck, and then driving off the

2109
02:17:58,412 --> 02:18:06,152
factory every day? And it's a tough challenge. I see what others have been able

2110
02:18:06,191 --> 02:18:10,072
to do in rockets, in electric vehicles, turning around

2111
02:18:10,152 --> 02:18:14,052
huge factories. We know this can be done, and so

2112
02:18:14,492 --> 02:18:18,172
for fusion, the call is there, and the market is there too. If you can

2113
02:18:18,212 --> 02:18:23,752
get electricity generators cheap enough, then it's worth doing.

2114
02:18:23,812 --> 02:18:27,531
- Yeah. All of this is really exciting and inspiring what you're doing.

2115
02:18:27,572 --> 02:18:31,432
And obviously the world needs it, and the

2116
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:35,502
more cheap energy we have of this kind, that we

2117
02:18:35,572 --> 02:18:38,892
described, clean, and it's not constrained to geo-

2118
02:18:38,901 --> 02:18:42,812
locations and so on, first of all, that alleviates a

2119
02:18:42,912 --> 02:18:46,432
lot of the tension that in geopolitics. But second of all, it

2120
02:18:46,472 --> 02:18:51,572
enables a lot of the technological breakthroughs on the AI side.

2121
02:18:51,592 --> 02:18:54,611
on all the different things that we use compute for. It's really, really exciting.

2122
02:18:55,892 --> 02:19:00,272
So yeah, hope there's like millions of them in the coming decades.

2123
02:19:00,312 --> 02:19:04,842
- And so if we can get to that, if we can get to making a generator a day, you're not

2124
02:19:04,842 --> 02:19:08,031
now talking about hundreds a year, and you're deploying them.

2125
02:19:08,072 --> 02:19:11,912
And deploying them is also hard at this scale.

2126
02:19:12,012 --> 02:19:15,791
How do you go and deploy power plants and deploy generators at this scale and do it

2127
02:19:15,832 --> 02:19:19,781
quickly? Interestingly, data centers are a little bit of a nicer challenge in that

2128
02:19:19,791 --> 02:19:23,132
way, because I wouldn't, we wouldn't build

2129
02:19:23,191 --> 02:19:27,031
one 50 megawatt system and have to go build a site for it. We'd build a

2130
02:19:27,072 --> 02:19:30,992
site and put 100 of them on that site and have large amounts of power

2131
02:19:31,031 --> 02:19:34,822
for that large data center. And so, so that in some ways is actually

2132
02:19:35,031 --> 02:19:38,912
in the chicken and egg problem of how do you go deploy hundreds or thousands of fusion

2133
02:19:38,951 --> 02:19:42,732
generators. Data centers are an interesting application where

2134
02:19:42,832 --> 02:19:46,611
very immediately you need a lot of power in a very small area.

2135
02:19:46,672 --> 02:19:50,552
And you can go, you can go do that. Now, what does that mean? That means I'm going to

2136
02:19:50,572 --> 02:19:52,892
need more than two conveyor belts, that's for sure.

2137
02:19:52,972 --> 02:19:56,952
- Yeah. Yeah. Well, you have to... I mean, manufacturing is really hard. But

2138
02:19:56,992 --> 02:20:01,272
like you said, the fascinating thing is it's hard but as you're doing it

2139
02:20:02,272 --> 02:20:05,812
you figure out all the other things: the science and the physics and everything.

2140
02:20:05,932 --> 02:20:10,252
Everything... The innovation is accelerated when you have to

2141
02:20:11,372 --> 02:20:14,572
manufacture at scale. It's actually fascinating to watch. You see that in the

2142
02:20:15,532 --> 02:20:19,492
space industry as well. When do we humans

2143
02:20:19,552 --> 02:20:23,452
get to Kardashev Type One civilization status? And when

2144
02:20:23,492 --> 02:20:25,722
do we get to a Kardashev Type Two?

2145
02:20:25,772 --> 02:20:29,702
- So the Kardashev scale, Kardashev Type One civilization is

2146
02:20:29,732 --> 02:20:32,932
when humans are either catching or

2147
02:20:32,972 --> 02:20:36,372
generating as much power as what's incident on the

2148
02:20:36,432 --> 02:20:40,329
Earth from the sun. Type Two is the next big one,

2149
02:20:40,359 --> 02:20:44,119
where you're catching as much energy from all the way around the sun, so

2150
02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:47,900
massive amounts of energy. And a lot of times, people talk about it as

2151
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:51,840
incident, as in you had solar panels the size of the entire planet

2152
02:20:51,980 --> 02:20:55,939
blocking all of the sun. But I think really, you should be thinking about it as what

2153
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:59,770
can we generate? What can we make here on Earth? And,

2154
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:03,310
What we know is that, you know, we're only a fraction right now of

2155
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:07,119
Kardashev Type One, and we got some work to

2156
02:21:07,180 --> 02:21:11,119
do. And there's not a lot of technologies that can

2157
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:14,039
get there, just from the point of view of the fuel.

2158
02:21:14,080 --> 02:21:14,189
- Right.

2159
02:21:14,220 --> 02:21:18,140
- But if, as some research say, that there's 100

2160
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:22,020
million to a billion years of fusion fuel on the Earth, we have room to

2161
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:23,960
go, and that's at today's use.

2162
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,859
So 100 times today's use, we still have tons of fuel. Let's go

2163
02:21:27,880 --> 02:21:31,740
do it. And what does that unlock? What does it unlock to have

2164
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:35,650
power 100 times the output that we actually do here on Earth right now?

2165
02:21:36,119 --> 02:21:40,020
And I think that's pretty transformational. Do we have those huge AI

2166
02:21:40,039 --> 02:21:44,029
data centers? Do we have brains that can now think at

2167
02:21:44,060 --> 02:21:48,800
rapid speeds and now innovate? I think that's a pretty powerful future.

2168
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:52,779
- Yeah, I can just imagine a giant AI brain and rockets

2169
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:56,900
just constantly shipping more and

2170
02:21:56,939 --> 02:22:01,199
more humans out into space, into colonizing space, and we're expanding

2171
02:22:03,220 --> 02:22:07,100
out into the universe. I mean, it's a obviously

2172
02:22:07,140 --> 02:22:10,900
there's a lot to be concerned about. Technology in itself is always a

2173
02:22:10,920 --> 02:22:12,020
double-edged sword.

2174
02:22:12,039 --> 02:22:15,650
There's always a concern that we humans, in the power we create, will also

2175
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:19,640
destroy ourselves in obvious ways and less

2176
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:25,650
than obvious ways. I've been spending a lot of time in nature. Of time in nature.

2177
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:27,300
And you become distinctly aware that

2178
02:22:28,439 --> 02:22:32,380
there's something truly special about the simplicity, the

2179
02:22:32,420 --> 02:22:37,080
balance that is achieved by nature. And in some sense, we

2180
02:22:37,939 --> 02:22:41,820
disturb that balance by creating sophisticated technologies. But in

2181
02:22:41,859 --> 02:22:43,920
another sense, we're building something

2182
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:48,480
in the spirit of nature that's more and more beautiful and allows us humans to

2183
02:22:48,539 --> 02:22:52,830
flourish in a richer and richer way. So, a double-edged sword.

2184
02:22:52,939 --> 02:23:01,740
- I think a lot about what does vast amounts of low-cost energy, low-cost electricity

2185
02:23:01,779 --> 02:23:08,880
enable, and how does that work with nature? And if you have power, and this is why,

2186
02:23:09,119 --> 02:23:14,960
one of the reasons we love fusion, is that's energy-dense. So, a 50-megawatt facility

2187
02:23:15,800 --> 02:23:19,740
we believe fits in a 27,000 square foot building, on the order of

2188
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:23,699
an acre, for 50 megawatts. Compare that to solar

2189
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:27,720
would be 2,000 acres, at least in Seattle. And what

2190
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:30,160
you can do there is transformational.

2191
02:23:30,180 --> 02:23:34,100
And a lot of folks talk about desalination and clean water so that we

2192
02:23:34,140 --> 02:23:37,650
can be in places where there's not a lot of water

2193
02:23:37,720 --> 02:23:41,689
and those things. I actually think about food, ironically, is that how much of

2194
02:23:41,720 --> 02:23:45,789
the Earth's surface that used to be nature is now farmland?

2195
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:49,640
And we need it. We're going to grow food because humans need to eat,

2196
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:52,880
and that's really critical, but it's about 5 feet tall

2197
02:23:54,119 --> 02:23:57,760
all over the Earth. Why can't you do it at 500 feet? Why can't you build a

2198
02:23:57,800 --> 02:24:01,589
building where you're actually growing? In the building, you're growing

2199
02:24:01,699 --> 02:24:05,520
plants. I spend a lot of time thinking about growing plants, ironically.

2200
02:24:05,680 --> 02:24:09,560
At high densities, of food densities, so that we can eat and

2201
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:13,330
we can exist and we can coexist in a way that's

2202
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:16,820
energy-dense and rich. You mentioned actually going to space.

2203
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:20,840
You know, how do we go to space now? We take methane

2204
02:24:20,859 --> 02:24:24,789
fuels, or hydrogen fuels, and we burn them and we launch a rocket.

2205
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:28,589
There are all kinds of cool beamed rocket technologies that

2206
02:24:28,939 --> 02:24:32,890
I looked at early in my career, where you can, like, beam microwaves, and

2207
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:36,859
so you have a microwave craft that doesn't have to burn any fuel. And so if

2208
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:40,779
you have really dense, really good power on Earth, you can beam it to

2209
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:44,580
that microwave craft. It can now use electricity

2210
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:49,260
as its rocket fuel. And so there are some really powerful, interesting things you

2211
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:52,869
can do. Even deep space, it gets also more enabling,

2212
02:24:52,880 --> 02:24:56,850
but even just launching from Earth. And so I think it

2213
02:24:56,900 --> 02:25:00,770
opens up things we don't really even think about, but it's just been theorized,

2214
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:04,640
"Wow, if I had massive amounts of power in a small place that

2215
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:08,600
is low cost, this is what it could do." But I'm

2216
02:25:08,660 --> 02:25:12,640
excited by what it can unlock that even we can think about now, but even what we can't

2217
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:14,600
think about or we don't know yet.

2218
02:25:14,960 --> 02:25:18,080
- Since you mentioned propulsion, is there some interesting use,

2219
02:25:18,939 --> 02:25:22,720
possible use of nuclear fusion in propulsion, whether

2220
02:25:22,760 --> 02:25:26,880
it's getting off of Earth or in going into deep space?

2221
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:30,850
- I mean, that's... Honestly, in a lot of ways, that's how I got into fusion is

2222
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:35,320
thinking about that intersection of energy and space travel.

2223
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:42,840
And when you are in the solar system, around Earth's orbit, collecting the sun's

2224
02:25:42,900 --> 02:25:46,869
energy makes a lot of sense. And it's there. It's free. When you're in

2225
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:50,640
space, you get a lot more of it because the atmosphere is not blocking it. And so that's why

2226
02:25:50,720 --> 02:25:54,279
spacecraft run on solar panels. But if you want to go further out, the sun's

2227
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:58,720
irradiance falls off as R-squared, radius squared. And it's a

2228
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:02,789
long way out there. It doesn't take very long before there's not a

2229
02:26:02,840 --> 02:26:06,520
lot of energy anywhere from the sun. And so you have to bring it with

2230
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:10,359
you, and in space, mass is expensive. Mass is hard. That's the rocket equation.

2231
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:14,800
And so being able to bring high energy density fuel

2232
02:26:15,619 --> 02:26:19,000
is really exciting, and that's what fusion

2233
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:22,760
enables. But here's one of the challenges. If you make

2234
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:24,920
electricity from fusion using a steam cycle,

2235
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:29,020
you now need to have somewhere. You need something

2236
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:32,900
cool, so you get hot water, you now have to be able to cool it. And in

2237
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:36,859
space, there's nothing to cool. There's no working fluid to cool

2238
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:40,670
off of. And so actually, a lot of the steam-based systems in

2239
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:44,640
fusion don't make sense for space. And so that's where some of this

2240
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:48,539
direct energy, this energy efficiency matters. It actually

2241
02:26:48,560 --> 02:26:52,439
comes to some of the origin story of the team that founded Helion.

2242
02:26:52,900 --> 02:26:56,340
Before spinning off Helion to focus only on

2243
02:26:56,400 --> 02:27:02,760
fusion, we worked on a mix of things: advanced materials, rocket propulsion,

2244
02:27:02,820 --> 02:27:07,528
fusion, fusion rockets, fusion materials, all of those things.

2245
02:27:07,548 --> 02:27:08,018
- Nice.

2246
02:27:08,088 --> 02:27:12,038
- And one thing that people in the aerospace field

2247
02:27:12,748 --> 02:27:16,008
especially if you're in deep space, is you can't waste anything.

2248
02:27:16,188 --> 02:27:19,968
Every watt of electricity you make, you better use, 'cause it was expensive to get it,

2249
02:27:20,008 --> 02:27:23,168
or the solar panel. Every ounce of every joule of heat, every watt of heat you make,

2250
02:27:23,248 --> 02:27:27,148
every ounce of every joule of heat, every watt of heat you make,

2251
02:27:27,188 --> 02:27:31,128
you have to reject with a radiator, and it's super expensive and heavy.

2252
02:27:31,208 --> 02:27:34,868
And so you build in space as efficient as possible. You recirculate your water and your air,

2253
02:27:34,908 --> 02:27:38,588
You recirculate your water, and your air,

2254
02:27:38,748 --> 02:27:42,708
and all of those things, you're efficient. And it's something we brought into thinking about

2255
02:27:42,948 --> 02:27:46,088
thinking about fusion energy efficiency.

2256
02:27:46,108 --> 02:27:49,858
is that you want to... If my goal is to make the product, what's the product? The product is electricity.

2257
02:27:49,908 --> 02:27:53,528
The product is electricity. Don't waste any of it. Recover every watt you can by recovering electricity

2258
02:27:53,588 --> 02:27:56,828
Recover every watt you can by recovering electricity directly.

2259
02:27:56,868 --> 02:28:00,808
Recover every electricity from the fusion process as efficiently as you can.

2260
02:28:00,908 --> 02:28:04,748
and you end up with, just like in space, systems that are smaller, have higher performance,

2261
02:28:04,808 --> 02:28:08,408
smaller, have higher performance, and can deliver more, whatever the mission is.

2262
02:28:08,448 --> 02:28:11,738
And in our case, the mission is electricity.

2263
02:28:13,508 --> 02:28:17,428
- When you look out there at the stars, I'm

2264
02:28:17,468 --> 02:28:21,148
really confused by what's going on, because I think there is for sure

2265
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:25,568
thousands, if not millions, of advanced alien civilizations

2266
02:28:25,648 --> 02:28:33,048
out there. I'm really confused why we have not, in a definitive way, met

2267
02:28:33,188 --> 02:28:38,828
any of them. So again, continuing the pothead questions, what energy

2268
02:28:38,928 --> 02:28:42,868
source do you think they're using? If what I'm saying is true, that there is alien civilizations

2269
02:28:42,908 --> 02:28:46,688
out there, do you think it's, like, pretty certain that they, in

2270
02:28:46,788 --> 02:28:50,468
order to expand out into the cosmos, they would be using nuclear fusion?

2271
02:28:50,528 --> 02:28:54,268
- It's hard to imagine anything else. That right now, what ... where does

2272
02:28:54,308 --> 02:28:58,298
energy in the universe come from? And it comes from fusion. It comes from stars

2273
02:28:58,368 --> 02:29:02,098
and- and we- we know that that's the process. And so whether they're

2274
02:29:02,128 --> 02:29:06,048
harnessing the star itself, Kardashev type two, or

2275
02:29:06,128 --> 02:29:10,028
are they bringing fusion along 'cause they want to go somewhere and they're bringing it

2276
02:29:10,048 --> 02:29:14,868
with them to go visit. I think that that's pretty likely.

2277
02:29:16,128 --> 02:29:19,888
That's pretty likely. You bring up the Fermi paradox. How come we don't see alien civilizations?

2278
02:29:20,008 --> 02:29:23,968
How come we don't see alien civilizations? Even if it's an infinitesimally small chance

2279
02:29:24,008 --> 02:29:27,928
if it's an infinitesimally small chance that there is life on any one planet,

2280
02:29:27,988 --> 02:29:31,768
and infinitesimally small that life grows into intelligent life,

2281
02:29:31,828 --> 02:29:35,458
there are, however, almost infinite planets around infinite stars in our galaxy

2282
02:29:35,528 --> 02:29:39,368
infinite planets around infinite stars in our galaxy that have been around for vastly longer

2283
02:29:39,448 --> 02:29:43,248
that have been around for vastly longer than we've been around. But we don't see it,

2284
02:29:43,288 --> 02:29:46,897
But we don't see it, and I think that's a question that many scientists and everyone has wrestled with

2285
02:29:46,968 --> 02:29:49,988
that many scientists and everyone has wrestled with over the years.

2286
02:29:50,048 --> 02:29:53,448
- I mean, I'm very scared by the implications of that.

2287
02:29:53,458 --> 02:29:57,268
The scary thing is that, to the point that we made earlier, as we

2288
02:29:57,308 --> 02:30:00,448
become more and more technologically advanced, we end up

2289
02:30:00,848 --> 02:30:04,108
destroying ourselves. Like, there could be things we unlock,

2290
02:30:05,728 --> 02:30:08,888
like nuclear weapons, but plus plus.

2291
02:30:08,908 --> 02:30:15,078
Like, new things that happen as you develop super advanced systems that close to 100% probability

2292
02:30:16,388 --> 02:30:20,057
that close to 100% probability destroy ourselves, destroy any intelligent being.

2293
02:30:20,088 --> 02:30:24,028
destroy ourselves, destroy any intelligent being. The kind of intelligent being that's ambitious enough

2294
02:30:24,108 --> 02:30:27,968
The kind of intelligent being that's ambitious enough to keep innovating will eventually destroy itself,

2295
02:30:28,328 --> 02:30:32,268
will eventually destroy itself, will be one explanation. And that's scary.

2296
02:30:32,308 --> 02:30:35,568
That should be a sobering thought. That's at least an inspiring, sobering thought to be careful

2297
02:30:35,628 --> 02:30:38,608
an inspiring, sobering thought, to be careful with the stuff we create.

2298
02:30:38,668 --> 02:30:44,288
create. But I also just look at humans. We create dangerous stuff-

2299
02:30:44,388 --> 02:30:49,268
and then figure out, sometimes almost last minute, how to not destroy ourselves.

2300
02:30:49,308 --> 02:30:53,628
minute, how to not destroy ourselves. We're good with deadlines.

2301
02:30:53,768 --> 02:30:55,617
- We're good with deadlines. Ah, we-

2302
02:30:55,648 --> 02:30:59,748
- And we're good at, like, surviving. I mean, life as we know it on Earth

2303
02:31:01,008 --> 02:31:04,888
seems to find a way, and intelligent life

2304
02:31:04,948 --> 02:31:08,788
as we know it, human life, seems to find a way. We do a lot of painful

2305
02:31:08,828 --> 02:31:12,568
things along the way, but in the end, we

2306
02:31:12,588 --> 02:31:16,588
somehow survive. It's interesting. There's something in the human spirit-

2307
02:31:16,788 --> 02:31:23,268
that allows us to survive. So I have a lot of optimism about the

2308
02:31:24,008 --> 02:31:27,508
super powerful technologies that we create will eventually lead to us

2309
02:31:27,788 --> 02:31:31,308
still surviving for thousands of years. But then, like, why are the

2310
02:31:31,388 --> 02:31:33,688
aliens not here, though?

2311
02:31:33,748 --> 02:31:36,958
So maybe it's also possible that it's really difficult to traverse

2312
02:31:37,048 --> 02:31:41,028
space. Maybe it really is that difficult. The physics makes it

2313
02:31:41,108 --> 02:31:45,448
not easy. There's a lot of space, and it's just hard to- hard to travel.

2314
02:31:45,528 --> 02:31:53,238
- I think I, as I have gone further and further in building fusion systems that work

2315
02:31:53,568 --> 02:31:57,257
I've become more optimistic around the Fermi Paradox specifically. And

2316
02:31:57,288 --> 02:32:01,188
there's- there is the, uh ... There's several of them. The ... I think

2317
02:32:01,228 --> 02:32:04,938
you're referring to something called the great filter. S- something happens that

2318
02:32:05,348 --> 02:32:09,148
filters out life. The dark forest is another

2319
02:32:09,168 --> 02:32:13,108
philosophy around, sure, it's out there, but everybody's hiding 'cause they

2320
02:32:13,128 --> 02:32:17,038
won't- don't want to be noticed. But I think about something else, actually. The philosophy that I've

2321
02:32:17,088 --> 02:32:22,738
always loved, and I'm going to pronounce this wrong, so I apologize, Matrioshka brains.

2322
02:32:22,738 --> 02:32:26,688
... is that ... And that's Kardashev level two, that civilizations

2323
02:32:26,788 --> 02:32:30,688
get so advanced, and they focus not on expanding

2324
02:32:30,868 --> 02:32:34,358
physically, and expanding in space, and expanding

2325
02:32:34,358 --> 02:32:38,288
their reach by planting flags in new places,

2326
02:32:38,308 --> 02:32:42,288
but grow their cognition, grow their ability to

2327
02:32:42,308 --> 02:32:46,048
think. They grow their brain. They grow their intellect. And

2328
02:32:46,288 --> 02:32:50,068
I- I feel like in the last few years, we've seen a massive

2329
02:32:50,148 --> 02:32:53,388
trend that maybe this is the thing that happens,

2330
02:32:54,088 --> 02:32:59,428
and that we do grow our intellect, and we grow the- the intellect of the species by

2331
02:33:00,408 --> 02:33:08,168
AI and advanced tools. And- and as a society can just get smart enough that we

2332
02:33:08,207 --> 02:33:11,967
don't need to go plant those flags everywhere. And so the Matrioshka brain

2333
02:33:12,008 --> 02:33:15,658
is a Dyson sphere where a civilization

2334
02:33:15,748 --> 02:33:19,627
has covered the entire sun in essentially solar panels

2335
02:33:19,668 --> 02:33:23,598
or collects its light in some way and uses all of that power to

2336
02:33:23,627 --> 02:33:27,008
power intelligence, to power computers and to power

2337
02:33:27,088 --> 02:33:30,967
brains. And I think we're a way from that, a ways away from that,

2338
02:33:31,108 --> 02:33:34,867
but maybe AI and fusion together gets you actually

2339
02:33:34,887 --> 02:33:38,728
along that path sooner. And I'm- I'm excited by that

2340
02:33:38,768 --> 02:33:41,928
outcome of the Fermi paradox. And then at that point, those

2341
02:33:41,967 --> 02:33:45,748
civilizations have a- a star that you can't find anymore 'cause it's all

2342
02:33:45,768 --> 02:33:49,047
covered and are there thinking and growing their

2343
02:33:49,108 --> 02:33:52,168
intellects rather than actually having to physically expand.

2344
02:33:52,308 --> 02:33:55,887
- Yeah. Exploring and expanding in the realm of

2345
02:33:55,928 --> 02:33:59,527
cognition and consciousness versus in the realm of space and

2346
02:33:59,627 --> 02:34:05,668
time as we- we 21st century colonizer humans

2347
02:34:07,608 --> 02:34:11,508
Think like. Maybe 22nd century humans will be

2348
02:34:11,547 --> 02:34:15,287
thinking fundamentally differently. Yeah, that's a beautiful, beautiful

2349
02:34:15,297 --> 02:34:18,978
vision of the future. Speaking of beauty, you've

2350
02:34:19,008 --> 02:34:22,908
been doing a lot of really interesting things in a lot of interesting

2351
02:34:22,967 --> 02:34:26,918
disciplines. What to you is...

2352
02:34:27,588 --> 02:34:31,258
ridiculous question, is the most beautiful idea in physics and

2353
02:34:31,348 --> 02:34:38,287
nuclear engineering, in nuclear fusion and power plants? What ideas

2354
02:34:39,508 --> 02:34:44,728
you just step back are and are in awe of?

2355
02:34:45,547 --> 02:34:50,848
- I'm continuously in awe that it works.

2356
02:34:51,047 --> 02:34:54,728
And I know that sounds a little silly to say.

2357
02:34:54,828 --> 02:35:02,467
But the more that I learned in my career around the balance of exactly the right

2358
02:35:02,527 --> 02:35:06,467
temperatures where life works, exactly the

2359
02:35:06,508 --> 02:35:10,527
right balance between the electromagnetic force and the strong force.

2360
02:35:12,148 --> 02:35:19,668
Those are things that it's hard to imagine are accidental.

2361
02:35:21,588 --> 02:35:28,367
And so we talk about how beautiful nature is, but then you look at

2362
02:35:28,447 --> 02:35:32,408
what each of the leaves on the tree really is, and each of the

2363
02:35:32,467 --> 02:35:36,318
cells and each of the atoms and each of the quantum substructure of that

2364
02:35:36,367 --> 02:35:42,088
atom, and I'm just amazed that all the pieces come together.

2365
02:35:42,268 --> 02:35:49,568
- we humans are somehow able to find that perfect balance where it just works.

2366
02:35:49,627 --> 02:35:53,508
- Just works. Last minute sometimes, but it does work.

2367
02:35:53,518 --> 02:35:57,277
- The kind of deadlines you're operating, your

2368
02:35:57,308 --> 02:36:01,228
the group of brilliant people that you're working with or operating under, it just

2369
02:36:01,268 --> 02:36:06,928
stresses me out, but it excites me. So I'm deeply grateful that you're doing this

2370
02:36:07,008 --> 02:36:10,447
work. You're one of the people building an exciting future.

2371
02:36:10,508 --> 02:36:14,677
So thank you for doing that, and thank you so much for talking today.

2372
02:36:14,728 --> 02:36:17,217
- Thank you very much. It's been fun.

2373
02:36:17,268 --> 02:36:21,158

now, let me leave you with some words from the great John F.

2377
02:36:32,627 --> 02:36:36,508
Kennedy. "We choose to do these things,

2378
02:36:36,568 --> 02:36:39,387
not because they are easy, but because they are

2379
02:36:39,467 --> 02:36:49,646
hard." Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
