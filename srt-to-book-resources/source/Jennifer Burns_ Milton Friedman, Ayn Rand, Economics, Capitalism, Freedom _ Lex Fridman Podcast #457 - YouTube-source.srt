00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,780
- The following is a conversation with Jennifer Burns,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,390
a historian of ideas,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,460
including the evolution of economic,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,290
political, and social ideas

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,253
in the United States in the 20th century to today.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,100
She wrote two biographies,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,150
one on Milton Friedman and the other on Ayn Rand,

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,060
both of which I highly recommend.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,430
This was a super technical

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,730
and super fascinating conversation.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,470
At the end, I make a few comments

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,670
about my previous conversation with President Zelenskyy

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,743
for those of you who may be interested.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,620
This is the Lex Fridman Podcast.

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,673
And now, dear friends, here's Jennifer Burns.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,370
You have written two biographies,

19
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,450
one on Milton Friedman and one on Ayn Rand.

20
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,170
So if we can, we will focus on each one separately.

21
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,003
But first, let's talk

22
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,260
about the ideas the two of them held in common.

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,459
The value of individual freedom, skepticism of collectivism,

24
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,920
and the ethics of capitalism.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,950
Can you talk about the big picture ideas they converge on?

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,783
- Yeah.

27
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:15,960
So Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand, in the biggest picture,

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,700
they're both individualists,

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,510
and they're skeptical of collectivities and collectivism.

30
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,480
So their unit of analysis is the individual,

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,740
what's good for the individual,

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,030
what works for the individual,

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,480
and their understanding of society kind of flows from that.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,480
They also both use this focus on individualism to justify

35
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,170
and to support capitalism as a social and economic system.

36
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,480
So we can put them in a similar category.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,100
We can call them individualists,

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,980
we could call them libertarians of a sort.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,390
But they're also really different

40
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,400
in how they approach capitalism,

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,753
how they approach thinking.

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,740
Ayn Rand developed her own moral

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,580
and philosophical system to justify individualism

44
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,830
and to connect the individual to capitalism

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,360
and to support capitalism as a social and economic system.

46
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,160
Friedman struggles a bit more with how

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
to justify capitalism,

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,980
and he'll ultimately come down to freedom as his core value,

49
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,840
his God, as he says.

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,870
And so freedom does connect back to the individual.

51
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,570
But he's not justifying capitalism for his own sake.

52
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,590
He's justifying it

53
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,490
for its ability to underwrite freedom in a social sense

54
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,800
and also in the individual sense.

55
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,820
- At a high level,

56
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,470
are there interesting differences between them?

57
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,790
You already mentioned a few.

58
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,130
Maybe in terms of who they are personally,

59
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,470
maybe in terms of how they approach the justification

60
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,270
for capitalism, maybe other ways.

61
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,103
- Yeah, for sure.

62
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:44,250
So beyond this idea that Milton Friedman takes a while

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,620
to come to his justification of capitalism,

64
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,990
whereas Ayn Rand kind of has it from the start.

65
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,220
She really focuses on the core quality of rationalism

66
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,450
and rationality.

67
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,960
Rationality is the defining feature of human beings,

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,900
and so she works from there.

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,230
Whereas Friedman, Milton Friedman eventually converges

70
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,090
on this idea of freedom.

71
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,110
So that's one part of it.

72
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,030
The other is their intellectual styles

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,110
are really, really different.

74
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,030
Their interpersonal styles are really different.

75
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,810
So, Friedman has big ideas, big principles that guide him,

76
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,760
but he's also deeply empirical.

77
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,240
He spends most of his career doing historical research,

78
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,970
economic research, pulling data from

79
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,100
how people actually make economic decisions

80
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,060
and live in the world,

81
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,880
and using them to test and refine his theories.

82
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,120
Where Rand, to some degree, we could say she's empirical

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,100
in that she lives through the Russian Revolution

84
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,440
and takes a very big lesson from that,

85
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,120
but her style of thinking is really first principles,

86
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,250
an axiomatic approach,

87
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,640
going from the basic idea of rationality

88
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,400
and then playing that out in different spheres.

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
And so those are

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,580
just very different intellectual approaches.

91
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,170
And then they lead

92
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,380
in some ways to really different ways of thinking

93
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,173
about how you get things done in the world.

94
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,510
Ayn Rand is a purist.

95
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,180
She wants to start with the pure belief.

96
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,670
She doesn't want it to be diluted.

97
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,927
You know, one of her favorite sayings was, you know,

98
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:12,690
"It's earlier than you think."

99
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,523
In other words,

100
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:15,990
we're still moving towards a place where we can really hold

101
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,123
and express these ideals purely.

102
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,209
Friedman, although he didn't use this terminology,

103
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,310
was much more half-a-loaf guy.

104
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,260
You know, like, I'll take what I can get,

105
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,630
and then I'll try to move to where I really want to be.

106
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,960
But he is able to compromise, especially when he moves

107
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,160
from being an economist

108
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,580
into being more of political thinker.

109
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,550
And so that's a really different intellectual style.

110
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,690
And then it also plays out

111
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,280
in their lives in that Ayn Rand is incredibly schismatic.

112
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,030
I mean, she wants her friends to believe what she believes

113
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,310
and support what she supports.

114
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,143
And she's willing

115
00:04:51,143 --> 00:04:54,150
to break a relationship if it doesn't match.

116
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,410
Milton Friedman,

117
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,563
he also does tend to have friends who agree with him,

118
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,090
yet he's always willing to debate his opponents,

119
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,520
and he's willing to do so with a smile on his face.

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,010
You know, he's the happy warrior,

121
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,470
and he actually will win a lot of debates simply

122
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,240
by his emotional affect

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,730
and his cheerfulness and his confidence,

124
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,130
where Rand will lose debates because she gets

125
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,050
so angry in the face of disagreement.

126
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,410
So, yeah, they have a lot of similarities

127
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,400
and a lot of differences,

128
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,560
and it's been really fascinating to kind of dive deep

129
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,610
into both of them.

130
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,990
- I just re-listened to Ayn Rand's, I think, last lecture,

131
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,220
or at least it's called that,

132
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,930
and just the confrontational nature

133
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,600
of how she answers questions

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,660
or how she addresses critics and so on.

135
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,300
There is a kind of charisma to that.

136
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,430
So I think both of them are very effective

137
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,540
at winning over sort of popular support,

138
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,710
but in very different styles.

139
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,010
It seems like Ayn Rand is very cranky, but there's,

140
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,680
I mean, it's the most charismatic, cranky person

141
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,210
I think I've ever listened to.

142
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,660
- Yeah, I mean, people talked about her,

143
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,690
meeting her, and coming to believe

144
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,890
in her ideas in a similar way as they did with Marxism,

145
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,560
in that suddenly everything made sense,

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,990
and that when they came to believe in Objectivism,

147
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,100
they felt they had this engine

148
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,290
for understanding the entire world.

149
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,090
Now, after a while, for most people,

150
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,070
that then became confining.

151
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,690
But, yeah, that certainty,

152
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,330
and Friedman had some of that as well.

153
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,860
He clothed it differently.

154
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,770
He clothed it in happiness, where Rand kind of clothes it,

155
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,930
as you said, in crankiness or anger.

156
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,580
I mean, there's also an arc to Rand.

157
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,980
She gets kind of angrier and angrier and crankier

158
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,350
and crankier over the course of her life.

159
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,300
What I enjoyed about my research is I was able to get

160
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,730
into this early moment when she was different

161
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,080
and a little more open,

162
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,900
and then I kind of watched her close

163
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,910
and her harden over time.

164
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,030
- Would it be fair to say that Milton Friedman

165
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,100
had a bit more intellectual humility,

166
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,370
where he would be able to sort of evolve over time

167
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:03,060
and be convinced by the reality of the world,

168
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,090
to change sort of the nuances of policies,

169
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,780
the nuances of how he thought about economics

170
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,770
or about the world?

171
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,090
- Yeah, absolutely.

172
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,850
Friedman believed in being able to say, "I was wrong."

173
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,610
And there are some things he said he was wrong about.

174
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,850
We'll delve more into monetarism and monetary policy,

175
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,040
but he was able to talk

176
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,960
about the ways his ideas hadn't mapped

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,690
onto the world the way he thought they would.

178
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,700
He does a really interesting interview

179
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,800
at the end of his life where he's beginning

180
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,280
to voice some doubts about globalization,

181
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,800
which he was sort of a prophet of globalization,

182
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,060
a cheerleader of globalization.

183
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,800
He really thought it would lead to a better world

184
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,120
in all respects.

185
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,110
And towards the end of his life,

186
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,700
it's about two years before he dies,

187
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,477
there's a note of doubt about how globalization unfolded

188
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:49,980
and what it would mean,

189
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,870
particularly for the American worker.

190
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,940
And so you can see him still thinking.

191
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,560
And that, to me,

192
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,720
I had sort of assumed he became crankier

193
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,790
and crankier and more and more set in his ways.

194
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,320
And of course, there's a phase

195
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,430
where he does become that way,

196
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,900
especially as he's in the public eye

197
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,760
and there's not room for nuance,

198
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,400
but to find in the last years of his life,

199
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,753
him being so reflective,

200
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:12,883
that that was absolutely not something Rand could do.

201
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:15,510
- I think there's a thread throughout this conversation

202
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,750
where we should actually also say that you're

203
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,000
kind of a historian of ideas.

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,860
- I am a historian of ideas, yes.

205
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,180
- And so we're talking about today, in part,

206
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,179
about two people who kind of fought for ideas, for an idea,

207
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,159
like we mentioned freedom for capitalism.

208
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,679
And they did it in very different ways.

209
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,659
And it's so interesting to see

210
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,660
sort of the impact they both had and how their elucidation,

211
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,220
explanation of those ideas reverberated throughout society

212
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,930
and how we together, as a society,

213
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,193
figure out what works,

214
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,510
the degree to which they have influence on the public,

215
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,830
the degree to which they have influence

216
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,330
on individual administrations,

217
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,790
like the Reagan administration, Nixon, and so on,

218
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,970
and how it might return, like, fade away

219
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,860
and then come back in the modern times.

220
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,060
And it's so interesting if you just see this whole world

221
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,530
as a game of ideas where we're pushing and pulling

222
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,723
and trying to figure stuff out.

223
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,790
A bunch of people got real excited over a hundred years ago

224
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,920
about communism, and then they try stuff out,

225
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,070
and then the implementation broke down,

226
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,260
and we keep playing with ideas.

227
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,730
So these are the two greats of playing with ideas.

228
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,890
I think that's a thread that just runs through this.

229
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:38,723
- Yeah.

230
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:40,290
And of kind of pushing back

231
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,280
against that movement towards communism, social democracy.

232
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,820
But one difference that I really should emphasize,

233
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,950
Rand is a writer of fiction.

234
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,110
She's a philosopher, but she's also a writer of fiction.

235
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,490
So she is working almost in the mythic register,

236
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,440
much more in the psychological register.

237
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,290
She's creating characters that people identify with

238
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,160
and people relate to experiences they've had.

239
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,050
And that's one of the reasons she hits so deep.

240
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,970
And she's also offering people, you know,

241
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,530
I read all the fan letters to her.

242
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:12,757
People would say things like,

243
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:14,670
"I read 'The Fountainhead,'

244
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,940
and now I'm getting a divorce," you know? (chuckles)

245
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,180
You know, having just these incredible realizations.

246
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,570
- Milton Friedman didn't get such things.

247
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,960
- And Milton Friedman didn't get such things.

248
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,567
Or, you know, I'll meet someone and they'll say to me,

249
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,620
"You know, Ayn Rand is the reason I went to medical school."

250
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,747
You know, like a woman said this to me a few years back,

251
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:35,640
"It never even occurred

252
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,860
to me that I could be a doctor until I read Ayn Rand.

253
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,840
And I said, 'I'm going to go to medical school.'"

254
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,720
And so she has that really intense impact on people.

255
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,050
So she thought of herself as rational.

256
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,070
She thought of rationality as kind of what she was doing,

257
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,330
but she was actually doing

258
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,770
a kind of mythopoetic psychological work as well.

259
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,040
Whereas Friedman on the one hand was much more rational

260
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,080
and there's a whole set of economic thinking

261
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,930
and he provides a rational framework

262
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,550
for understanding the world,

263
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,510
and it's the framework of neoclassical economics.

264
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,343
At the same time,

265
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:14,790
he does pull on mythologies of the idea of America

266
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,100
in the Gilded Age, the frontier mythology,

267
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,160
the individual immigrant, the settler mythology.

268
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,940
He pulls on these, but he doesn't create them.

269
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,723
And he's more kind of playing a tune he already has.

270
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,850
Whereas I think Rand

271
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,040
really does something a little bit deeper

272
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,830
in her ability to reach into people's psyche

273
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:39,450
and then take that emotional psychological experience

274
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,020
and fuse it to an intellectual world and a political world.

275
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,827
And that's really what makes her so powerful.

276
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:48,900
And so I think she comes back in

277
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,350
to relevancy in a different way than Friedman does,

278
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,910
because I think in some ways she's tapped

279
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,860
into a kind of more universal human longing for independence

280
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,133
and autonomy and kind of self-creation and self-discovery.

281
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,570
- Nevertheless, there are still pragmatic ideas

282
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,990
that are still important today from Milton Friedman,

283
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,700
even just on the economics level.

284
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,233
So let's dig in.

285
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,803
Let me try.

286
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,770
I took some notes.

287
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,930
Let me try to summarize who Milton Friedman is

288
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,360
and then you can correct me.

289
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,950
Okay, so he is widely considered to be one of the greatest

290
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,080
and most influential economists in history,

291
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,570
not just the 20th century, I think ever.

292
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,810
He was an advocate of economic freedom, like we said,

293
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,960
and just individual freedom in general.

294
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,810
He strongly advocated for free market capitalism

295
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,453
and limited government intervention in the economy,

296
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,790
though you do give,

297
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,560
I've listened to basically everything you have

298
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,580
on the Internet.

299
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,750
You give some more depth

300
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,543
and nuance on his views on this and in your books.

301
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,030
He led the famed Chicago School of Economics

302
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,290
and he won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976.

303
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,600
He greatly influenced economic policies

304
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,110
during the Reagan administration and other administrations.

305
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,930
He was an influential public intellectual,

306
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,050
highly influential, not just among economists.

307
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,950
He lived 1912 to 2006,

308
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,530
so that means he lived

309
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,450
and worked through some major world events

310
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,040
where his ideas were really important,

311
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,740
The Great Depression with the New Deal,

312
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,790
World War II with the post-war Reconstruction,

313
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,690
the rise and fall of the Bretton Woods monetary system,

314
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,970
as we may talk about,

315
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,430
the Cold War and all the conflicts involved

316
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,790
in that, sort of the tensions around communism and so on,

317
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,400
so the fall of the Soviet Union.

318
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,320
And also he has some interesting relationships

319
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,320
to China's economic transformation since the 1970s,

320
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,640
the stagflation of the 1970s,

321
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,440
and I'm sure there's a lot more, so.

322
00:13:56,988 --> 00:14:00,150
Can you maybe continue this thread

323
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,380
and give a big picture overview

324
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,360
of the ideas he is known for?

325
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,193
- Yeah, sure.

326
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,820
And that's a great summary.

327
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,290
You learn fast.

328
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,530
So let me start with the economics,

329
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,260
and then I can kind of transition

330
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,600
to how he used those economic ideas

331
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,970
to become a real voice

332
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,440
in the American conservative movement,

333
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,640
in the American political realm.

334
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,110
So I'll kind of highlight for ideas

335
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,943
or contributions or episodes.

336
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,970
One was his work with Anna Schwartz

337
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,030
in revising our understanding of The Great Depression.

338
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,920
And that's tightly related to the second,

339
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,900
which is the school of monetarism

340
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,250
that he and Schwartz really become founders of.

341
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,890
Then there is the prediction of stagflation

342
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,780
and the explanation of that in the 1970s,

343
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,300
which really is one of these,

344
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,090
these sort of career-making predictions.

345
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,260
And we can dig into that.

346
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,600
And then in terms of technical economics,

347
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,050
he's known for the permanent income hypothesis,

348
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,940
which he develops with a group

349
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,800
of female collaborators that I can talk about.

350
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,530
So those are kind of four technical pieces,

351
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:10,470
end up being really brought together

352
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,710
in what becomes the Chicago School of Economics.

353
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,880
He's undoubtedly the head

354
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,490
and the leader of the Chicago School of Economics.

355
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,370
There's an earlier generation that he learns from.

356
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,053
There's his generation.

357
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,110
There's also a Chicago School of Law

358
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,140
and Economics that's really profoundly influential.

359
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,973
And then there'll be

360
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:32,310
kind of a third generation that he's somewhat distinct from,

361
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,740
but that goes on to really shape economics.

362
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,560
But let me go back to these kind of four pieces

363
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,710
and let me start with Great Depression.

364
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,040
So Milton Friedman actually lives

365
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,660
through the Great Depression.

366
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,410
He's in college when it hits, and he is,

367
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,160
so he's in college, it's 1928 to 1932,

368
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,870
and he's aware of the Depression and he's deciding,

369
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,200
should I study mathematics or should I study economics?

370
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,110
And he's had some good economics teachers,

371
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,510
but it's really the context,

372
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,150
it's looking around at the slow, you know,

373
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,370
dissolving of economic prosperity.

374
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,720
So he decides to go to Chicago,

375
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,760
he decides to study economics.

376
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,010
And what's really interesting

377
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,270
is that the Great Depression is so unexpected,

378
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,840
it's unpredicted, it's unprecedented.

379
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,850
And economists are really struggling

380
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,470
to know how to respond to it.

381
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,480
And so he's going to arrive at the University

382
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,830
of Chicago when the field is struggling to know what to do.

383
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,680
So he's in this kind of really open space

384
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,690
where the institutional economics

385
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,870
of the 1920s has failed to predict,

386
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,460
which was focused on business cycles.

387
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,293
This is the irony.

388
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,950
Their big thing was charting

389
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,570
and understanding business cycles.

390
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,510
And then we have the biggest business cycle of all time.

391
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,860
And they haven't seen it coming,

392
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,080
and they don't have a good explanation for it.

393
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:00,080
And what he will get at Chicago is the remnants

394
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,010
of a monetary understanding of the economy.

395
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,770
And so his teachers,

396
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,630
they don't know exactly what's going on,

397
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,050
but they look first to the banking crisis.

398
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,760
They look first to the,

399
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,099
in 1933, it's bank runs,

400
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,770
failures of maybe it's up to a third of American banks.

401
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,140
It's huge, thousands of banks are failing per week.

402
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,339
So they're focused on that.

403
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:26,490
So that's the first kind of imprint he will have.

404
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,720
The Great Depression has something

405
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,060
to do with the banking system.

406
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,460
The second imprint he will have is that all

407
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,830
of his professors are profoundly concerned

408
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,750
about the social crisis.

409
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,020
They want relief programs, they want them now.

410
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,360
They want bank regulation and financial reform.

411
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,470
They're very active.

412
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,680
This is not laissez-faire by any stretch of the imagination.

413
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,210
So Friedman has that imprinting, and then about,

414
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,567
so he gets there in '32.

415
00:17:54,045 --> 00:17:58,260
'36, '37, the ideas of John Maynard Keynes from Britain,

416
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,790
which has a different explanation,

417
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,830
Keynes has a different explanation of the Great Depression,

418
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,860
will kind of make landfall in American economics

419
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,170
and be very profoundly influential

420
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,940
on most American economists,

421
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,680
but Friedman already,

422
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,820
it's too late for Friedman.

423
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,830
He already has a different perspective.

424
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:18,150
So Keynesianism unfolds, I can say more about that,

425
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,370
but it basically leads

426
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:24,330
to more active federal government participation

427
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,590
in the economy.

428
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,380
And what underlies a lot of that,

429
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,050
its adaptation in America particularly,

430
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,800
is the idea that capitalism has failed,

431
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Capitalism has revealed itself to have a profound flaw

432
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,250
in that it's cycles of boom and bust

433
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,560
create social instability, chaos.

434
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,170
It needs to be tamed, it needs to be regulated.

435
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:54,170
And so that becomes the kind of baseline of politics

436
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,230
in the United States.

437
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,090
The understanding of the New Deal,

438
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,890
the understanding of the Democratic Party,

439
00:18:58,890 --> 00:18:59,723
even to some extent,

440
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,170
the understanding of the Republican Party.

441
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,493
And Friedman never quite,

442
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,920
never quite sure about that.

443
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,020
He has a hunch that there's something else going on.

444
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,000
And he does not buy that capitalism

445
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,560
has sort of ground to a halt,

446
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,920
or the other idea is that capitalism has gone through some

447
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,060
sort of phase transition, and it worked great,

448
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,710
maybe while we had a frontier.

449
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,410
This is a very serious argument that people are making.

450
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,780
The United States used to have a frontier,

451
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,840
a place where Europeans hadn't fully settled.

452
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,180
Of course, they're pushing out the native tribes.

453
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,020
That's another story.

454
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,620
But that this frontier is the engine of economic growth.

455
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,690
And the frontier is now over, it's closed,

456
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,010
and we're going to stagnate.

457
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,230
There's a theory of secular stagnation.

458
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,330
And so to deal with secular stagnation,

459
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,850
we're just going to have to have a more active state.

460
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,970
So Friedman is suspicious of all these assumptions,

461
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,690
and he has this idea that it's something to do with money.

462
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,980
Money is somehow important.

463
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,910
And so he joins together with Anna Schwartz,

464
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,920
who is an economist.

465
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,110
She doesn't at this time hold a PhD.

466
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,600
She's working for the National Bureau of Economic Research.

467
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,730
And they come together to do this study of money

468
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,320
in the US economy.

469
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,550
And it takes him 12 years to write the book.

470
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,680
And they're releasing their ideas and they're arguing.

471
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,680
And Friedman is writing papers, giving talks,

472
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,927
saying, "Money's really important,"

473
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,570
and nobody's really believing him.

474
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,403
He's a crank.

475
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:23,520
He's at Chicago, he's out,

476
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,400
you know, Chicago's a well-known university,

477
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,500
but he's sort of considered a crank.

478
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,620
And then in '63, he and Anna Schwartz published this book.

479
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,740
And it's, you know, 800 pages.

480
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,820
It's a reinterpretation

481
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,190
of the history of the United States through money.

482
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,370
Like the central character is money, whether it's specie,

483
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,710
greenback, or the US currency.

484
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,510
And they have a whole chapter on the Great Depression.

485
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,730
And what they've literally done,

486
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,170
Schwartz has done most of this.

487
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,667
They've gone, Schwartz has gone to banks and said,

488
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,530
"Show me your books."

489
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,020
And then she's added up, column by column,

490
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,430
how much money is in your vault,

491
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,170
how much money is on deposit,

492
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,310
how much money is circulating.

493
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,320
And so they literally have graphs,

494
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,910
you can see them in the book,

495
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,610
of how much money has been circulating in the US

496
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:06,840
at various different points in time.

497
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,370
And when they get to the Great Depression,

498
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,370
they find the quantity of money available

499
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,650
in the economy goes down by a third.

500
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:16,590
And in some ways this is completely obvious,

501
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,370
because so many banks have failed

502
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,320
and we don't have any type of bank insurance at that point.

503
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,210
So if your bank goes under, your savings are there,

504
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,010
the money essentially vanishes,

505
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,510
and it's fractional reserve banking, right?

506
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,343
So you've put in,

507
00:21:31,343 --> 00:21:34,890
they can loan up to 90% off on their deposits.

508
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,470
And so Friedman and Schwartz present this argument

509
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,020
that what really made the Great Depression so bad

510
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,850
was this drop in the amount of money,

511
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,140
the 30% drop in the money,

512
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,180
they called the great contraction.

513
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,357
And then they go further and they say,

514
00:21:49,357 --> 00:21:51,840
"Well, how did this happen and why?"

515
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,410
And they pinpoint the Federal Reserve,

516
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,780
which is a fairly new institution at that time.

517
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,120
And they say, "What did the Federal Reserve do?"

518
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,290
The lender of last resort,

519
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,480
what did it do in the face of what they're depicting

520
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,360
as a massive, unprecedented liquidity crisis?

521
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,480
And they find it's not really doing much.

522
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,400
And they really dig into the details,

523
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,240
and they find that the Federal Reserve

524
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,190
has gone through a sort of personnel change

525
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,890
and some of the key leaders in the 1920s,

526
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:23,100
Benjamin Strong is one of them, he's now deceased.

527
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,890
And the dominance of the New York Federal Reserve,

528
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,750
which in their telling is global, it's interconnected,

529
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,480
it's seen a lot of financial things come and go.

530
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,350
And they believe that the New York Fed had the understanding

531
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,150
to recognize this is a liquidity crisis.

532
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,560
We should be very generous,

533
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,510
we should support all the banks.

534
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,070
Their influence has diminished

535
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,203
for the kind of banks that are more,

536
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,780
they don't say, like the rubes and the hicks,

537
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,650
but it basically is.

538
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,820
It's like the people

539
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,230
in charge don't know what they're doing.

540
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,210
And so the Fed pursues this

541
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,190
kind of policy of masterly inactivity.

542
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,810
They don't see it as their problem.

543
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,770
They don't do much.

544
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,080
There's an enormous liquidity crisis.

545
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,950
And that's their version

546
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,140
of what the Great Depression is all about.

547
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,570
That it's a financial system meltdown,

548
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,460
it's a liquidity crisis.

549
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,620
And that it, in some ways,

550
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,480
well, in many ways, they argue,

551
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,790
very strong counterfactual argument,

552
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:20,430
the Federal Reserve could have prevented it,

553
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,263
and it did not.

554
00:23:21,263 --> 00:23:25,110
And so it becomes then an institutional failure

555
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,880
and a political failure,

556
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,090
not a failure of capitalism as a system.

557
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,510
And so this book comes out, it's a blockbuster.

558
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,037
And even those economists who've been like,

559
00:23:36,037 --> 00:23:38,670
"Friedman is a crank, I don't buy it,"

560
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,853
are like, "Friedman and Schwartz are onto something.

561
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:42,621
Milton Friedman, Anna Schwartz are onto something."

562
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,710
And so that really changes the game.

563
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,320
And this is also one

564
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,770
of his most influential contributions,

565
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,620
because Friedman and Schwartz becomes the playbook

566
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,060
for the Federal Reserve.

567
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,850
And we have lived through this, right?

568
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,450
In the financial crisis,

569
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,970
the Federal Reserve is ready to loan.

570
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,240
Covid, the Federal Reserve does all kinds of new things,

571
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,720
because no Federal Reserve chair wants to be

572
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,140
in Friedman and Schwartz 2.0 that somebody writes

573
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,110
where they're the bad guy who let the economy melt down.

574
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,300
So, you know, the specifics

575
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,240
of what they say to do have obviously evolved

576
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,380
as the system has changed,

577
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,460
but this is a playbook for how to deal with economic crisis.

578
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,480
It's Friedman and Schwartz.

579
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,970
And so it's absolutely fundamental.

580
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,960
And that is really going to be the place he makes his mark.

581
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,406
- There's a lot of things to say here.

582
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:36,353
So first, the book we're talking about

583
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:39,780
is the "A Monetary History of the United States,"

584
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,440
in part for which Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize.

585
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,570
You've also mentioned the influence of the Great Depression,

586
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,970
if you could even just rewind to that.

587
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,700
So he went to, I guess, college in Rutgers.

588
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,533
- [Jennifer] That's right.

589
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:56,220
- And he was, you know, mathematical proclivities,

590
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,160
so he was kind of wanting to be a mathematician.

591
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,820
And so it's kind of a cool crossroads.

592
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,150
It's interesting how the right time,

593
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,940
the right person arrives.

594
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,223
So you describe this really well, that,

595
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,700
so he had this choice to be a mathematician or an economist.

596
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,410
And the economist is University of Chicago,

597
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,320
mathematician is Brown University, whichever.

598
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,320
And then this is also the beginnings, as you've described,

599
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,350
of mathematical economics.

600
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,413
So he fits in nicely into this using,

601
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,630
I think you said the number

602
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,402
of equations started going up per paper,

603
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:36,235
- [Jennifer] Yes.

604
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,680
- Which is a really nice way to put it.

605
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,810
So really the right person

606
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,980
at the right time to try to solve this puzzle

607
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,780
of the economy melting down.

608
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,210
It's so interesting, just one human,

609
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,120
it's just, from just zooming in

610
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,450
on a single human making a decision about life

611
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,930
and it's hard to know when you're in it

612
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,550
that the world is melting down

613
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,590
from an economics perspective

614
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,090
and that I could do something

615
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,120
about this to figure out what it is.

616
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,330
And also I'm going to reject the mainstream narrative

617
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,100
about why this happened.

618
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,620
- Yeah, so the other piece of the puzzle,

619
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,640
when he goes to Rutgers,

620
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,930
he thinks he'll be an actuary.

621
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,890
So Milton Friedman's family, his parents are immigrants,

622
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,230
Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe.

623
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,130
They're pretty atypical in that they don't stay in New York,

624
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,400
you know, and they move to Rahway, New Jersey,

625
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,280
and they put together a fairly middle-class life

626
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,320
as kind of, they have a shop.

627
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,850
They do some wholesale buying and selling.

628
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,130
And then his father dies when he's 16.

629
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,860
His life becomes more precarious,

630
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,260
but it's never as precarious as he makes it out to be.

631
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,690
He's got three older sisters, they earn a good living,

632
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,820
incidentally, they all have better grades

633
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,750
in high school than he does,

634
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,650
but he's the one that goes to college.

635
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,450
But it's actually really important

636
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:57,030
that he loses his father figure,

637
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,820
because he's then looking for other father figures.

638
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,500
And he meets two at Rutgers.

639
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,760
One is Arthur Burns,

640
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,120
who will go on to have a huge influence in his career.

641
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,448
No relation to me, by the way,

642
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:09,420
(Lex and Jennifer chuckle)

643
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,820
but Arthur Burns is like him,

644
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,670
a fellow Jewish immigrant boy on the make.

645
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:17,820
He's older, and he's making a career as an economist.

646
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,080
And then there's Homer Jones,

647
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,960
who has gone to the University of Chicago

648
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,277
and is studying with Frank Knight at Chicago and says,

649
00:27:24,277 --> 00:27:25,830
"You have to go to Chicago."

650
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,330
So he has these two mentors.

651
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,917
And Burns in particular suggests,

652
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,830
"Oh, I could be an economist.

653
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,330
That could be my career path."

654
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,510
The idea to be an actuary for an insurance company,

655
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,830
I'm not sure where he got that idea,

656
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:40,080
but he just thought that was something he could do

657
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,250
as someone who was good at math.

658
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,300
And so that college

659
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,330
really opens the perspective, opens the door.

660
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,613
And then I think it's really key that again,

661
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:53,130
he doesn't get an explanation that he buys

662
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,120
for the Great Depression.

663
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,800
So then he's looking for one.

664
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,840
And the math part

665
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,600
is a really interesting aspect of his career.

666
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,070
Now, he actually comes to Chicago to study

667
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:08,550
with a mathematical economist, Henry Schultz.

668
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:12,196
But he gets there and he thinks Schultz is kind of dumb.

669
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:13,029
(Lex laughs)

670
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,890
He really does.

671
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,420
He's incredibly arrogant,

672
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,850
and he just thinks this guy's not that smart.

673
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,530
And it seems that, I mean,

674
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,090
Schultz did some really important work

675
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,340
in the early stages of mathematical economics.

676
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,387
But a lot of the oral histories about him are like,

677
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:27,270
"Yeah, he wasn't that bright," you know?

678
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,670
So Friedman's maybe onto something.

679
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,720
So he falls into the set

680
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,850
of students who are really enthralled

681
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,070
with this other professor, Frank Knight.

682
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:41,130
And Frank Knight is against math in economics.

683
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,650
Frank Knight is like, you know, a neoclassical economist,

684
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,480
but not a mathematical economist.

685
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,130
He's an old-school liberal.

686
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,660
He's really concerned about liberal democracy,

687
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,860
economic liberalism.

688
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,370
And Friedman is very deeply influenced by Knight,

689
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,680
and he continues to pursue mathematical economics.

690
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,530
So he'll go, for part of his graduate career,

691
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,080
he goes to Columbia University,

692
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,297
where he actually gets his PhD from,

693
00:29:05,297 --> 00:29:09,150
and he works with a mathematical economist there.

694
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,950
And so he comes out trained

695
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:14,820
in what will eventually be econometrics in statistics

696
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,250
and economics, his early publications are in statistics,

697
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,570
but it's not really

698
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,390
where his intellectual heart and soul are.

699
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,790
And eventually he will turn very profoundly

700
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,190
against mathematics and economics

701
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,290
and become a sort of heterodox strain

702
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,463
throughout 20th century economics

703
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:32,493
that says, "Simple models are better.

704
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:38,160
We need to work off empirical data,

705
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,710
not construct elegant models,"

706
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,200
and becomes really

707
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,000
sort of countercultural within economics in that way.

708
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,250
- And the test of a good model

709
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,770
is it should actually predict stuff that happens.

710
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,030
- It should predict stuff that happen.

711
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,953
It should tie back to what's going on.

712
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,230
- I'm wondering which direction to go.

713
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,100
So first, actually,

714
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,980
if we could zoom out on the different schools of economics.

715
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,813
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

716
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:00,720
- Just the basics.

717
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,070
You mentioned neoclassical.

718
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,260
We mentioned Keynesian economics.

719
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,330
We mentioned, what else did we mention?

720
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,340
Well, the Chicago School of Economics.

721
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,880
Where does Austrian economics fit into that pile?

722
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,160
And Marxian economics?

723
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,960
And can we just even just linger

724
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,630
and try to redefine Keynesian economics

725
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,670
and Chicago School of Economics,

726
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,353
neoclassical economics, and Austrian economics,

727
00:30:24,353 --> 00:30:27,600
because there's some overlap and tension.

728
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,120
- Okay, so schools of economics.

729
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,330
So we could start with classical economics.

730
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,520
Classical economics we could think of,

731
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,730
Adam Smith is kind of your classic classical economist,

732
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,500
the founder of the discipline.

733
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,490
Classical economics does not really use math,

734
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,890
is very close to political economy.

735
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,007
It's concerned with, as Smith puts it,

736
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:52,230
"The wealth of nations."

737
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,450
It's concerned to some degree with distribution.

738
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,740
It's concerned to some degree

739
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,380
with what makes a good political system.

740
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,380
And what tends to really define classical economics

741
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,120
when you're looking from a great distance

742
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,730
is what's called the labor theory of value.

743
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,630
So where does value come from in classical economics?

744
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:17,520
It comes from the labor that a person puts into it.

745
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,640
So maybe this in some way comes

746
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,700
from Locke's notion of property that you kind of mingle,

747
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,770
you know, your labor with the natural world.

748
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,450
We can say labor theory of value.

749
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,130
So classical economics concerned with Smith is arguing

750
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,863
against mercantilism for more free trade,

751
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,160
often goes by the name of political economy

752
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,510
to show it's more capacious.

753
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,750
It's thinking of politics and economics.

754
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,540
You can still read these books today.

755
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,280
The sentences are long, the words are different,

756
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,170
but you can still follow along.

757
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:53,400
So the real big transition from classical economics

758
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,010
and political economy to economics

759
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,060
as it's understood today,

760
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,520
comes with the marginal revolution.

761
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,400
And the marginal revolution is a scientific revolution

762
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,000
that happens in a couple different places simultaneously.

763
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,620
This is one of these things that you see

764
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,610
in the history of science.

765
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,620
Like, you know, there'll be some breakthrough,

766
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,060
like Darwin has a breakthrough,

767
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,950
but like somebody else has sort of the same breakthrough

768
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,380
at the same time, totally, you know, differently.

769
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,090
So there's a version of marginalism that's continental.

770
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,640
You know, there's a version in the German-speaking lands,

771
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,680
in the French speaking lands, and in Britain.

772
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,570
And they all kind of come together,

773
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,710
and the shift is in the theory of value.

774
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,710
So the theory of value in marginalism is on the margin.

775
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,500
So say you have one apple and you want a second one.

776
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,510
How much is going from one apple to two apple worth for you?

777
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,530
Probably quite a bit.

778
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,790
If you had 10 apples,

779
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,760
maybe going to 11 apples doesn't matter that much.

780
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,920
The marginal value is less.

781
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,500
So what marginalism does, though,

782
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,090
most importantly is it opens the door to math in economics,

783
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,640
because it means you can graph this now,

784
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,123
you can depict this relationship graphically.

785
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,880
And there's some really interesting work

786
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,460
in the history of economics that shows a lot

787
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,360
of the people who developed marginalism were looking

788
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,370
to physics as a model,

789
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,500
physics, the queen of the sciences.

790
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,630
And so they were thinking,

791
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,490
they imported terms

792
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,430
from the natural world to describe the social world

793
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,080
through the lens of economics,

794
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,793
terms like equilibrium.

795
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,930
So the idea being that if you looked at a market,

796
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:41,670
a market would reach equilibrium when everybody has bought

797
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,710
and sold all that they want,

798
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,360
or the price will settle

799
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,570
at an equilibrium price when it's really the demand

800
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,040
and supply are matching up.

801
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,790
- And some of these ideas are things we would pick up

802
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,050
at a microeconomics class.

803
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,690
- Oh yes, this is still out there.

804
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,270
This is sort of the basic foundation

805
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,300
of microeconomics, marginal analysis.

806
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,230
And so in the German-speaking intellectual tradition,

807
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,409
this is the root of Austrian economics.

808
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,810
And people picking up the marginal revolution

809
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,639
in the German speaking lands are opposed

810
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,902
to the historicists,

811
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,310
who are thinking in a more evolutionary way

812
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,150
about how societies kind of grow and change.

813
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:29,150
And they have a vision of economic ideas

814
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,400
as applying differently to different types

815
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,050
of social arrangements.

816
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,710
Where the marginalists, remember, are inspired by physics.

817
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,543
And this is a set

818
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:42,060
of natural laws that applies anywhere

819
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,550
to any sort of human society.

820
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,889
So that's his first really big fissure

821
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,630
that we'll see again and again.

822
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,610
Are you historically minded?

823
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:55,463
Do certain traits of economic life inhere, adhere,

824
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,130
and become expressed in certain types of societies?

825
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,740
Or are there universal economic laws that flow

826
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,300
through any type of society?

827
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,880
So that's kind of a juncture, a break.

828
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,353
And so marginalism,

829
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,130
first people start using really geometry

830
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,330
to kind of graph things.

831
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,150
But marginalism is also opening up to the possibility

832
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,000
of calculus and the possibility of creating models.

833
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,060
But at that point in time, late 19th century,

834
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,790
a model is something like a physicist does,

835
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,440
like think of an inclined plane

836
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,480
and how fast does the ball roll from one to the other.

837
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,000
It's a physical representation of the world.

838
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,560
And eventually economists will start

839
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,740
to create mathematical representations of the world,

840
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,880
but we're not quite there yet.

841
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,090
So we're late 19th century and we have this fissure,

842
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,320
we have this introduction

843
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,110
of marginal analysis that marks the juncture

844
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,840
from classical economics to economics.

845
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,060
So let's say now we have economics,

846
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,060
but we still have this fissure between historical thinking

847
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,750
and let's call it natural law thinking,

848
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,583
that's not quite right,

849
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,593
but physical laws versus contingency.

850
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,640
And then in the United States this ends up mapping

851
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,100
onto debates about capitalism.

852
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,650
And so more historically-minded economists

853
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,420
tend to be interested in the Progressive movement

854
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:16,050
and which is invested in taming

855
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,970
and regulating industrial capitalism

856
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,770
and changing its excesses, you know,

857
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,640
factory safety laws, wage laws,

858
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,053
working conditions laws.

859
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,780
Yet in general,

860
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,500
American economists all use marginal analysis,

861
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,820
just in different ways.

862
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,320
The ones who are more drawn

863
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,270
to marginal analysis become known

864
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,850
as neoclassical economists.

865
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,260
They're neoclassical.

866
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,690
The neo is because they're using marginal analysis.

867
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,420
The classical is because they don't think we need

868
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,910
to change the way the economy operates

869
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,840
or the government operates.

870
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,830
They're not progressive,

871
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,230
whereas the progressives are saying things like,

872
00:36:53,257 --> 00:36:55,803
"We need to use social control.

873
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,800
The state and the people collectively

874
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,800
and democratically need to control the way economics unfolds

875
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,810
and make sure things are fair and equal."

876
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,750
So that school of thought becomes known

877
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:12,750
as institutional economics in the United States

878
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,190
by the 20th century.

879
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,020
So it's part of the Progressive movement,

880
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,520
late 19th century.

881
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,600
Into the 20th century,

882
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,030
it really becomes institutional economics,

883
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,350
and it's quite dominant.

884
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:24,600
And the neoclassical economists are still there,

885
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,700
but they're very much a minority.

886
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,520
And Frank Knight, Milton Friedman's teacher,

887
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,820
is one of the minority neoclassical economists.

888
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:36,623
And the institutionalists are much more progressive still.

889
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,340
- Is it fair to say that the neoclassical folks

890
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,810
and even the classical folks

891
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,063
versus the institutional economics folks,

892
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,670
they have a disagreement

893
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,770
about how much government intervention

894
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,420
that should be in the economy?

895
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,450
So neoclassical is less intervention,

896
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,610
and then institutional economists,

897
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,630
the progressive folks,

898
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,552
has more intervention.

899
00:37:58,552 --> 00:38:00,510
- Yes, yes, exactly right.

900
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,860
So this is the situation in the 1920s.

901
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,860
But the other piece I should mention is the first generation

902
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,750
of progressive economists were very radical.

903
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,960
They were closely allied with the socialist movement,

904
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,820
with labor radicalism,

905
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,670
and many of them lost their jobs at universities.

906
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,350
This is kind of connects to the early,

907
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,640
the dawn of academic freedom.

908
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,590
This is before academic freedom.

909
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,960
And they were chastened.

910
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,970
They became much more mainstream.

911
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,500
By the time we get to the 1920s,

912
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,590
we don't really have radical critiques of society

913
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,360
coming from economists.

914
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,370
Much smaller profession,

915
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,650
much less important than it is today,

916
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,770
and fairly peaceful,

917
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,380
because the 1920s are a fairly peaceful decade

918
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,700
in the United States.

919
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,300
So this is a situation when the Great Depression hits.

920
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,870
And as I mentioned before, the head,

921
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,090
the kind of most important institutional economist

922
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:58,860
is Wesley Mitchell,

923
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,440
and he has said,

924
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,590
he's written a whole book on business cycles,

925
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,600
but he doesn't see this business cycle coming.

926
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,150
And it hits, and he doesn't have a good explanation for it.

927
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,610
Now, perhaps the preeminent neoclassical economist

928
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,753
was Irving Fisher.

929
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,410
Now, Irving Fisher is big into the stock market,

930
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,557
and Irving Fisher says sometime in late summer 1929,

931
00:39:20,557 --> 00:39:23,880
"Stocks are going ever higher

932
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,820
and will continue to go ever higher forever."

933
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,775
And so he loses his reputation after the stock market crash.

934
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:33,420
So Milton Friedman is stepping into a field

935
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,550
in which the greats have been discredited

936
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,190
and there's an enormous economic crisis all around.

937
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,900
- And everybody's struggling

938
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,569
to figure out why the crisis happened.

939
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:42,402
- Yes.

940
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:45,150
And the other thing he's stepping into is a world where

941
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,100
in the United States,

942
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,100
there's a great deal of anger at capitalism, at the system,

943
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,340
unemployed people on the street.

944
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,490
In Europe, there's rising fascist movements.

945
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,010
In Asia, there's rising fascist movements.

946
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,250
And so everyone's very concerned about this.

947
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,260
And Friedman is seeing a lot

948
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,060
of this through the lens of Frank Knight,

949
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,210
who feels like we are maybe reaching the end

950
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,980
of what he calls liberalism.

951
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,780
He calls himself an old-fashioned liberalism.

952
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,800
We're reaching the end

953
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,720
of representative democratic government,

954
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,240
because representative democratic government

955
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,520
cannot solve these social problems.

956
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,540
And capitalism, as it has developed,

957
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,070
Knight is very pro-capitalist,

958
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,350
but he says it's generating inequality

959
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,140
and this is putting too many strains on the system.

960
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,540
So Knight will become one

961
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,460
of the people who helps Friedman think,

962
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:40,460
how do I develop a new theory of capitalism that works

963
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,180
in an era of mass democracy where people can vote

964
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,200
and people can express

965
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,870
at the ballot box their unhappiness

966
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,670
with what's happening economically?

967
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,830
So this larger movement will generate,

968
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,680
of which F. A. Hayek is a part,

969
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,460
Friedman is a part, that becomes the very early stirrings

970
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,320
of trying to think about a new sort

971
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,250
of liberalism which will eventually be called neoliberalism.

972
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,810
- Okay, so if we can just linger

973
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,490
on the definitions of things.

974
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,400
So we mentioned what neoclassical is,

975
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,250
and the institutional economics is.

976
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,857
What's Keynesian economics?

977
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:20,040
And the Chicago School of Economics, I guess,

978
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,720
is a branch of neoclassical

979
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,700
that's a little bit more empirical

980
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,730
versus maybe model-based. - [Jennifer] Yeah.

981
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,610
- And Keynesian is very model-heavy,

982
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,470
more intervention of government.

983
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,520
- [Jennifer] Yes.

984
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,690
- So the real battle is Keynesian versus everybody else.

985
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,047
- That is what eventually comes to pass in the United States

986
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:41,246
and in the kind of overall

987
00:41:41,246 --> 00:41:45,180
developed profession of economics.

988
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,470
The other piece of the puzzle here

989
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,300
is the introduction of mathematics.

990
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,550
And it's been around the edges,

991
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,550
but it will pick up speed in the 1930s,

992
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,520
like the Econometrics Society is founded.

993
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,170
They start publishing,

994
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,140
people start using more statistical

995
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,350
and mathematical tools to think about economics,

996
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,460
and they're given a boost,

997
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,400
sort of inadvertently by the rise of Keynesian economics.

998
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,943
So Keynes is trained in the neoclassical tradition.

999
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,540
He's an absolutely fascinating figure.

1000
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,690
He's been there in the peace negotiations at Versailles.

1001
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,000
He basically calls World War II.

1002
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,470
He's like, "Hey,

1003
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,050
we're gonna have another war here caused by Germany,

1004
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,780
because this peace Treaty has been done

1005
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,310
in such a vindictive way,

1006
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,840
and people have made such bad decisions."

1007
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,520
He's there, he sees it happening.

1008
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,390
And so when the Great Depression unfolds,

1009
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,880
he basically comes up with a new theory

1010
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,680
for explaining what's going on.

1011
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,220
And the previous neoclassical understanding

1012
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,070
is sort of things go up and things go down,

1013
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,030
and when they go down,

1014
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,250
there's a natural mechanism to bring them back up.

1015
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,960
So when the economy's going down,

1016
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,490
prices are going down,

1017
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,700
wages are going down, everybody's losing money,

1018
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,550
but eventually firms are going to realize,

1019
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,710
hey, I can hire people cheap.

1020
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,690
Hey, I can buy stuff cheap.

1021
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:04,920
I don't have a lot of competition.

1022
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,360
Maybe I should get in the game here.

1023
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,620
And then others will start to get in,

1024
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,140
and then you regenerate prosperity in that way.

1025
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:14,910
And so Keynes says, "Sure, that's one theory,

1026
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,250
but something different is happening right now.

1027
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,900
Part of why it's happening

1028
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,310
is because the working class is more empowered now.

1029
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,800
They're not simply going to just take low wages

1030
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,000
and ride them down to the floor.

1031
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,470
We might not hit the floor."

1032
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,557
But also, he says,

1033
00:43:29,557 --> 00:43:34,557
"People might become too anxious to spend.

1034
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,800
They might not want to invest."

1035
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,530
And, you know, Keynes has these discussions

1036
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,850
of animal spirits, right?

1037
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:45,960
He's still enough of a political economist to think not just

1038
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,250
in terms of human rationality,

1039
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,560
but what are some other things going on in human beings?

1040
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,410
And people might decide to sit on their money,

1041
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:54,000
they might not invest it.

1042
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,450
And so what happens then is you could get stuck

1043
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,520
in a bad equilibrium.

1044
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,140
So in the neoclassical model,

1045
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,870
the equilibrium kind of restarts and resets itself.

1046
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,340
And he says, "No, we could get stuck here.

1047
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,967
We could get stuck in the depression."

1048
00:44:06,967 --> 00:44:09,847
"And in that case, what has to happen," he says,

1049
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,600
"The government stimulates investment

1050
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,240
and the government itself invests."

1051
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,180
And then he argues that, you know, this is a student of his,

1052
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,477
Richard Kahn says, you know,

1053
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:21,150
"As the government invests a dollar,

1054
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,920
it has like a multiplier effect."

1055
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,270
A dollar spent by the government

1056
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,490
kind of ramifies out throughout the economy.

1057
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,510
So it takes the government and puts it in the center,

1058
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,343
as opposed to, say,

1059
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:33,330
the banking system or the financial system,

1060
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,310
which would be the more Friedman analysis.

1061
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,330
And for many economists of Friedman's generation,

1062
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,470
and he's a weird generation,

1063
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,380
because the generation that becomes dominant

1064
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,600
is just like four years older,

1065
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,220
the men who become Keynesian economics,

1066
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,870
but that four years is really important,

1067
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,690
because they come in to graduate school in economics

1068
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,490
and they get exposed to the new ideas

1069
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,113
of John Maynard Keynes, and they, you know,

1070
00:44:56,113 --> 00:44:58,380
I think it's Paul Samuelson calls it,

1071
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,010
like it was like a South Sea virus (chuckles)

1072
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:03,750
that attacked all of the younger,

1073
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,150
all of the younger economists immediately succumbed.

1074
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,090
And like no one under 50 ever got the disease, right,

1075
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,650
because their thinking's already set.

1076
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,860
And so Keynesianism,

1077
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:18,120
Keynes himself is very suspicious of math in economics.

1078
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,280
And he and Friedman, it's fascinating.

1079
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,540
One of the first books by Jan Tinbergen, a Dutch economist,

1080
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,860
to use math in economics,

1081
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,450
these huge volumes.

1082
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,990
Volume one, Keynes pans it.

1083
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:33,090
Volume two, Friedman pans it.

1084
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,500
So they're in the same page,

1085
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,550
but what happens is

1086
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,850
as Keynesianism arrives in the United States,

1087
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:42,030
Franklin Roosevelt is not really a Keynesian.

1088
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,033
He's kind of an accidental or experimental Keynesian.

1089
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,240
And there's a bunch of different ideas

1090
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,660
in the United States that are very similar to Keynesianism.

1091
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,620
They're not theorized,

1092
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,640
but they're similar ideas

1093
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,440
that the government has to do something.

1094
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,850
So this all comes together,

1095
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:00,090
and American economists realize

1096
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,090
that you can construct models in the Keynesian perspective.

1097
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:10,110
And if you can use numbers in these models,

1098
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,680
you can go to Washington D.C. with numbers,

1099
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,970
and you seem like you have a lot more authority.

1100
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:22,970
And so math becomes really twinned into Keynesian economics.

1101
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:29,270
- So numbers are used as a kind of a symbol of expertise.

1102
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,500
We really know what the hell's going on

1103
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,333
because we have some numbers, right?

1104
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,380
- Right, and we can create a model.

1105
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,213
And so we can say,

1106
00:46:35,213 --> 00:46:37,560
"Okay, in the model, the interest rate is here.

1107
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,490
Taxes are here.

1108
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,500
So let's play with government spending.

1109
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,000
Let's make it up, let's make it down,

1110
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,530
and then we can get an estimation.

1111
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:46,350
It'll spit out here's predicted GDP."

1112
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:49,260
So the other piece of the Keynesian revolution

1113
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,920
is it really gets people thinking kind of holistically

1114
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,920
about the economy as one conceptual unit.

1115
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:02,760
And you then have what Paul Samuelson

1116
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,070
will end up calling the neoclassical synthesis.

1117
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,855
And this was still in economics today.

1118
00:47:06,855 --> 00:47:10,500
If you take Micro, you're going to get supply and demand,

1119
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,420
scarcity, marginal analysis.

1120
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,800
If you take Macro,

1121
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,540
you're going to get a very different approach.

1122
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,970
And that's more Keynesian-based.

1123
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,920
And so the idea is that,

1124
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,880
and this makes sense, I mean,

1125
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,590
you can think of this from statistics, right?

1126
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,050
The way things act individually

1127
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,820
versus when they're all added together

1128
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,780
can be very different.

1129
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,360
So there's this kind of uneasy piece

1130
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,210
where economists are using

1131
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,480
kind of neoclassical tools to analyze individual behavior

1132
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,740
and individual market behavior.

1133
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,810
And they're shifting to a different paradigm when they think

1134
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,070
about the economy as a whole.

1135
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:43,920
And in this paradigm of the economy as a whole,

1136
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,180
the federal budget,

1137
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:48,120
the taxing and spending power of the federal government,

1138
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,260
become paramount.

1139
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,660
And that is called the fiscal revolution.

1140
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,360
And that's really the essence of Keynesianism.

1141
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,310
But the key thing to remember is that Keynesianism

1142
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,230
and Keynes are different.

1143
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,940
And there's this famous episode

1144
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,100
where John Maynard Keynes comes to D.C.

1145
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,687
and he goes to dinner,

1146
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:07,950
and he comes back

1147
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,363
and he says to one of his friends in London, he says,

1148
00:48:09,363 --> 00:48:11,400
"Oh, yeah, it was really interesting.

1149
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,527
I was the only non-Keynesian there."

1150
00:48:13,527 --> 00:48:14,577
(Lex laughing)

1151
00:48:14,577 --> 00:48:15,410
- [Lex] Yeah.

1152
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,710
- You know?

1153
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,090
- So Keynesianism

1154
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:21,780
is more government intervention, fiscal policy,

1155
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,970
so put the government

1156
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,080
at the center of influencing the economy.

1157
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,540
And then the different flavors

1158
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,250
of whether it's Austrian economics

1159
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:35,047
or Chicago School of Economics is saying,

1160
00:48:35,047 --> 00:48:39,000
"No, we have to put less government intervention

1161
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,300
and trust the market more."

1162
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,203
And the formulation of that

1163
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:46,950
from Milton Friedman is trust the money more,

1164
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,520
not trust, but the money supply is the thing

1165
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,260
that should be focused on.

1166
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,280
- Yes.

1167
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,810
So the Austrians

1168
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:59,160
and the Chicago schools see economic prosperity

1169
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,580
and growth comes from individual initiative,

1170
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,020
individual entrepreneurship,

1171
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,280
kind of private sources.

1172
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,500
The private market is what drives economic growth,

1173
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,420
not the public sector.

1174
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,420
And so for Friedman, then the question is,

1175
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,310
what is the government's role?

1176
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,310
And because he's lived through the Great Depression,

1177
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:19,050
he's not laissez-faire,

1178
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,910
and he won't ever be laissez-faire.

1179
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,070
Now, interestingly, Hayek,

1180
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,450
living through the Great Depression,

1181
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:26,610
at first is laissez-faire.

1182
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:29,310
And he's like, "Sure, let it rip."

1183
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:32,047
And things get so bad that Hayek's like,

1184
00:49:32,047 --> 00:49:33,570
"Okay, that's not gonna work.

1185
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,010
- Can we actually define laissez-faire?

1186
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,030
So what do we mean?

1187
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,110
Like, what's the free market?

1188
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,729
What's laissez-faire?

1189
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:40,050
What's the extreme version here?

1190
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,600
- So, yeah, laissez-faire means leave it be.

1191
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,000
In France, it's more often used

1192
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,180
as an insult than as an actual.

1193
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,390
Very few people are completely and totally laissez-faire.

1194
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,460
That would be, like the pure laissez-faire

1195
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,730
would be the sort of pure, maybe pure anarchist position,

1196
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,260
like the state does nothing,

1197
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,390
or the state isn't even there,

1198
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:01,920
but it tends to,

1199
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,260
if I could maybe make it more precise,

1200
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,820
it would be focused on freedom

1201
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,190
of contract would be essential.

1202
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,393
And that means,

1203
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,100
like the buyer of labor and the seller of labor

1204
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,580
must have absolute freedom to contract.

1205
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,860
So that means no minimum wage law,

1206
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,440
no working hours law,

1207
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,573
no employment law, things like that.

1208
00:50:25,414 --> 00:50:27,720
And this is all pre-Progressive movement.

1209
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,490
A lot of things are that way.

1210
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:32,130
You know, imagine you're in 19th century America

1211
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:32,970
and you have a farm,

1212
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,220
and you hire someone to help you on the farm.

1213
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,740
You offer the money, they take it.

1214
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:40,110
If they fall off a ladder and break their back,

1215
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:41,700
maybe you help them out, maybe you don't,

1216
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,610
but there's not a whole apparatus of legal liability

1217
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,210
and safety and things like that.

1218
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:47,903
So that would be one piece.

1219
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:49,950
Another piece of laissez-faire

1220
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,163
would be free trade amongst nations.

1221
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:58,380
So no regulation of who can invest in a nation

1222
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,110
or who can take money out of a nation.

1223
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,650
So Nippon Steel could come and invest in US Steel,

1224
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,040
and there would be no grounds in which to reject that.

1225
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,580
Or you could, as a billionaire in the United States,

1226
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,310
relocate you and all your money to another country,

1227
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,200
and the United States couldn't try to keep you

1228
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,500
and nobody else could stop you from coming in.

1229
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,240
And then in the context of economic crisis,

1230
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,240
laissez-faire would not encompass centrally provided relief

1231
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,750
because in the pure theory, again,

1232
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,580
very seldom applied purely,

1233
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,023
but in the pure theory,

1234
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,290
the wages need to come down far enough

1235
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,670
and people need to be desperate enough to start taking work

1236
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:46,650
and to start the machine again.

1237
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,530
So the theory would be if you give people relief,

1238
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,330
they might not go back to work.

1239
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:54,840
Now, almost nobody says that in the Great Depression,

1240
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,210
because the situation is so bad,

1241
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,130
and it's, you know,

1242
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,450
people are starving on the street

1243
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,750
and people feel for humanitarian and ethical reasons,

1244
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,370
it's not okay to say that.

1245
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:06,270
The Austrians, though,

1246
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,007
at first Hayek and Lionel Robbins are like,

1247
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:11,820
"This is a business cycle and it needs to run its course

1248
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,550
and it will be detrimental if we intervene."

1249
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:17,896
And then pretty soon Hayek has to change his tune.

1250
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:20,190
- So the Austrians are the most hardcore

1251
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:21,300
in terms of laissez-faire?

1252
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,133
- Absolutely.

1253
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:26,580
And so Hayek will make the turn towards accepting more

1254
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,500
of a state, and then will come to talk

1255
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,240
about how the state needs

1256
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,330
to support what he calls a competitive order.

1257
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,420
But his mentor, Ludwig von Mises,

1258
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,220
still remains very hardcore

1259
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:42,900
and is not really open to things like unemployment insurance

1260
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:46,320
or other state-based interventions.

1261
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,320
- What does von Mises say about human suffering

1262
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,630
that's witnessed in the Great Depression, for example?

1263
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,630
Like, what are we supposed to, as economists,

1264
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,820
as humans that define policy,

1265
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,350
what are we supposed to see

1266
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:01,560
when people are suffering at scale?

1267
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,750
- Yeah, I wish I knew an answer to that question.

1268
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,550
I don't know enough about von Mises

1269
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,790
and his reaction in the Great Depression.

1270
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:13,790
I think I would hazard that he would look more down the road

1271
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,330
and say, "Well, if you start here,

1272
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:20,970
you're gonna go places that are bad."

1273
00:53:20,970 --> 00:53:25,110
But I don't factually know what he said in response.

1274
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,740
I do know that Hayek's position doesn't last very long.

1275
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,420
It's not a position you can hold to,

1276
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,300
maybe you could hold to it in other cycles.

1277
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,280
The other thing that was interesting

1278
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,080
is I found very few Americans saying this.

1279
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,800
Most who were, were kind of small town electeds

1280
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,980
or the most famous is Andrew Mellon,

1281
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,270
quoted by Herbert Hoover.

1282
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:52,350
So not directly, we don't have him on record saying this,

1283
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,120
but apparently Hoover records

1284
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,120
in his memoirs that Mellon said something

1285
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,740
like, "Liquidate real estate, liquidate stocks,

1286
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,990
you know, purge the rottenness out of the system,

1287
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,817
people will live a healthier life."

1288
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,850
And certainly there were members

1289
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,900
of the Federal Reserve who felt like it would create,

1290
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,850
they didn't say moral hazard, but it would create

1291
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,370
what we now call moral hazard, bad habits,

1292
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,710
were we to intervene and to save failing banks,

1293
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,860
because failing banks need to be taught a lesson.

1294
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,360
They need to be taught discipline.

1295
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,530
And so a lot of people, I think,

1296
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,660
saw it in the context of discipline.

1297
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,250
This is discipline.

1298
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,160
And if you remove the discipline,

1299
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,800
you'll be taking away something fundamental in society.

1300
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,380
- So Milton Friedman never quite went all the way

1301
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,340
to laissez-faire.

1302
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,080
- No, no, he didn't see that.

1303
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,020
And what's really interesting is the number

1304
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,820
of incredibly radical proposals

1305
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,430
that he and his teachers were floating.

1306
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,350
So I've mentioned Frank Knight.

1307
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,270
Another really important influence

1308
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,120
on Friedman was Henry Simons,

1309
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,240
who was a junior professor at Chicago.

1310
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,240
And Simons had this idea for what he called 100% money,

1311
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:07,310
which would be a law that says banks have to hold 100%

1312
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,790
of the deposits they receive.

1313
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,070
They can't loan them out on the margin.

1314
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,300
So this would completely

1315
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,580
and totally have overhauled the US banking system.

1316
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,590
And he would have said, "There's a category

1317
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:18,420
of things called banks where you get deposits.

1318
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,460
And then there's going to be a category of sort of,"

1319
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,660
he didn't say investment banks,

1320
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,000
but investment vehicles that will invest.

1321
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,280
So similar to what did happen

1322
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,170
in some ways in the banking reforms

1323
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:32,880
in that in the 1930s the investment banks were split

1324
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,410
from the deposit banks,

1325
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:36,060
and the banks that took deposits

1326
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,320
were much more highly regulated

1327
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,970
and they were supported by the FDIC.

1328
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:41,490
But the point being the Chicago School

1329
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:44,340
had these very radical proposals for reform.

1330
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,270
Go off the gold standard, restrict the currency,

1331
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,770
change the banks, immediately relieve payments now.

1332
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:55,320
What is important to note though

1333
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,240
is that they thought of all of those

1334
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,720
as emergency measures to get through the emergency,

1335
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,720
not as permanent alterations in the state of what had to be,

1336
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,480
and not permanent alterations between state and market.

1337
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,210
Where the Keynesian assumption is things have changed,

1338
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,320
times have changed,

1339
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:15,030
we're in a new dispensation,

1340
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:16,980
and we need a new relationship.

1341
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:21,980
So Milton Friedman is very open to doing things differently

1342
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,260
in a state of emergency.

1343
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,880
He will have different ideas

1344
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,700
during World War II than any other time.

1345
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,570
And that's why I argue,

1346
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:32,850
I think he would have been supportive

1347
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,640
of at least the first rounds of coronavirus relief,

1348
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,473
because I think he

1349
00:56:36,473 --> 00:56:39,420
would have put his emergency thinking hat on.

1350
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:42,543
So in that way he was definitely more flexible.

1351
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:44,970
- You mentioned Hayek.

1352
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,800
Who is this guy?

1353
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,380
What's his relationship to Milton Friedman

1354
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,120
in the space of ideas

1355
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,430
and in the context of the Great Depression?

1356
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:55,020
Can we talk about that a little bit?

1357
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:55,853
- Sure.

1358
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:58,950
So F.A. Hayek is an Austrian economist

1359
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,800
who takes up a posting in London,

1360
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,670
and, you know, he's a mentor,

1361
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:08,130
a mentee rather, of Ludwig von Mises.

1362
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,800
He's writing about business cycles,

1363
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,280
Austrian capital theory, and the Depression hits.

1364
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,900
And he's one of the few economists who in the beginning,

1365
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,300
really is not calling for much intervention.

1366
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:25,350
Although as he realizes how politically unpalatable that is,

1367
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,300
he will develop a more softened version

1368
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,760
of Austrian economics that has room

1369
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,040
for a whole range of social services.

1370
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,810
What's significant about Hayek

1371
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:36,000
is that he is also watching what's happening

1372
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,280
in Austria, what's happening in Germany,

1373
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,620
and he's really worried the same thing is going

1374
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,680
to happen to the Western democracies.

1375
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,160
And he sees the root cause of this is socialism.

1376
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,020
This shift towards an expanded role

1377
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,760
for government which we've been talking about,

1378
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,050
is happening in the United States.

1379
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,090
It's also happening in Britain.

1380
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:57,157
And so he writes this book that becomes incredibly famous,

1381
00:57:57,157 --> 00:57:59,010
"The Road to Serfdom,"

1382
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,440
basically saying, taking these steps

1383
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,330
towards a planned economy

1384
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,130
or an economy that's a modified form

1385
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,950
of capitalism is going to, could,

1386
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:10,140
he's very clear that this is not an inevitability.

1387
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:11,940
But if the same steps are taken

1388
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,040
and people follow the same line of thinking,

1389
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:18,150
we may end up in a sort of coercive totalitarian state.

1390
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:22,050
So this becomes enormously popular in the United States.

1391
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,910
First of all, he's in good touch

1392
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:25,200
with Friedman's teachers,

1393
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,030
even before this book comes out.

1394
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:28,860
They see them as kindred spirits.

1395
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,120
Frank Knight is in touch with him.

1396
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,040
Henry Simons is in touch with him.

1397
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,600
They all see themselves as liberals.

1398
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,370
They call themselves old-fashioned,

1399
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:37,170
unreconstructed liberals.

1400
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,240
And so even before he becomes famous,

1401
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,020
Hayek will be trying to kind of organize thinkers

1402
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,040
and intellectuals who he believes shares his values

1403
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,500
of what we would call today classical liberalism,

1404
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,870
and to kind of create a counter-consensus

1405
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,550
to the one that's gathering.

1406
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:58,410
Now, Hayek also chooses not to argue against Keynes,

1407
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,440
and he feels that this is a huge missed opportunity,

1408
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,170
that he should have staked out the case against Keynes

1409
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:06,210
and that because he did not,

1410
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,850
people come to believe there is no case against Keynes.

1411
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,980
Keynes is literally unanswerable.

1412
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,963
So Hayek will have this great regret.

1413
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,810
He will channel some of his regrets

1414
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:18,120
into sort of community building,

1415
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,890
specifically developing the Mont Pelerin Society

1416
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,240
And it will fall to Friedman

1417
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,290
to really make that case against Keynes.

1418
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:30,660
But Hayek will end up at Chicago.

1419
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,900
And Hayek really influences Friedman to think

1420
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,340
about what Hayek calls the competitive order

1421
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:42,260
and how the state can and must maintain a competitive order,

1422
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,800
that is the system of laws, of norms,

1423
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,030
of practices that makes it possible for markets to function.

1424
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,340
And this is one of these key differentiators

1425
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,880
between the older philosophy of laissez-faire

1426
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,637
and the newer reconceptualization of liberalism, which says,

1427
01:00:00,637 --> 01:00:02,103
"Yes, we need a state.

1428
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:05,400
We need a state that's not intervening

1429
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,790
in markets under social democratic auspices,

1430
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:11,550
but is structuring and supporting markets

1431
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,343
so that they can function with maximum freedom,

1432
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,040
keeping in mind that

1433
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,040
if there aren't basic social supports needed,

1434
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,790
the market is apt to generate the type of either inequality

1435
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,620
or social instability

1436
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:28,140
that will call the whole system into question."

1437
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,400
So Hayek is really key

1438
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,340
in promoting this modified liberalism.

1439
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,357
But from being a very prominent economist in the 1920s

1440
01:00:36,357 --> 01:00:41,357
and 1930s, as mathematics becomes the language of economics,

1441
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,520
Hayek is completely left out in the cold.

1442
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,890
Now, Friedman to some degree, is left out in the cold.

1443
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:50,670
But Friedman at least has proved the mathematical economists

1444
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,220
that he knows what they're up to, and he's rejecting it

1445
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:56,460
from a position of expertise and knowledge.

1446
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,410
And he literally drives

1447
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:00,780
the mathematical economists out of Chicago.

1448
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,120
They're clustered in a group called the Cowles Commission,

1449
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,833
and he makes their life hell.

1450
01:01:06,180 --> 01:01:07,170
They flee.

1451
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:08,987
They flee the Friedman onslaught.

1452
01:01:08,987 --> 01:01:10,020
(Lex chuckles)

1453
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,680
But then when Hayek arrives at the University of Chicago,

1454
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,000
he would like to be considered

1455
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,860
for a position in the economics department.

1456
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,200
And Friedman, Milton Friedman, says, "No way.

1457
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,260
You're not really an economist because you're not empirical,

1458
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,417
because you just develop these theories."

1459
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:30,060
So he has an appreciation for Hayek as a social thinker,

1460
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,320
but not as an economist.

1461
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,150
So what Friedman decides to do,

1462
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,750
his answer to Keynes will be deeply empirical,

1463
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,340
but it will also be theoretical.

1464
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,570
And it will create an alternative intellectual world

1465
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:45,960
and approach for economists who aren't satisfied

1466
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,130
with Keynesianism.

1467
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:49,530
And almost single handedly,

1468
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:52,590
Friedman will introduce sort of political

1469
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:56,010
and ideological diversity into the field of economics,

1470
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,560
because from his beachhead in Chicago,

1471
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,993
he will develop the theory of monetarism.

1472
01:02:02,130 --> 01:02:03,720
So what is monetarism?

1473
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,280
The easy way to summarize it is this famous dictum

1474
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,057
of Milton Friedman's,

1475
01:02:10,057 --> 01:02:14,430
"Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomena."

1476
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,050
And it's fascinating that he becomes an expert in inflation

1477
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:21,600
because the first research,

1478
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,060
and the first major research product

1479
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,150
of monetarism is that theory of the Great Depression

1480
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,710
in "A Monetary History of the United States."

1481
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:32,970
And that is a theory of a deflation, all prices going down.

1482
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,160
And he will go back

1483
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,520
to an idea that Irving Fisher had popularized,

1484
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,860
but a very old idea, almost a truism,

1485
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,050
the quantity theory of money,

1486
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,240
which says, "The level of the price level

1487
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,470
is related to the amount

1488
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,620
of money circulating in an economy."

1489
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,300
So if you have more money, prices go up.

1490
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,610
If you have less money, prices go down.

1491
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,620
Now this seems like very basic

1492
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,860
and almost too basic to bear repeating,

1493
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,070
but Friedman is saying this very basic relationship

1494
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:06,090
holds true even in an advanced industrial economy.

1495
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,630
And that is what people have started to doubt.

1496
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,520
And if you think about money,

1497
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,810
you think about banks,

1498
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:16,200
you don't think necessarily about the federal budget,

1499
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,820
spending, and taxation.

1500
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,000
And what you see happens in American economics,

1501
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,490
the textbooks previous to the Keynesian revolution,

1502
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,530
they spent a lot of time on money,

1503
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,690
they spent a lot of time on interest rates.

1504
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:28,800
You can do word counts.

1505
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,350
And other scholars have done the word counts.

1506
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:32,183
And then word count

1507
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:35,190
for money after World War II just plummets

1508
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:38,040
and you start seeing things like taxation, budget,

1509
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,690
those things go up.

1510
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,980
So what happens

1511
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,580
is the economics profession shifts its attention.

1512
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:47,760
It just looks away from money to other things.

1513
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,357
And Friedman is one of the few who's saying,

1514
01:03:49,357 --> 01:03:53,190
"No, money still matters, money still counts."

1515
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:57,480
And it's a very counterintuitive argument to make.

1516
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,610
It's a very historical argument to make.

1517
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:02,370
And this is absolutely fascinating to me.

1518
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:06,840
With Anna Schwartz, he develops this 150-year timeframe.

1519
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:10,800
He also has students working on episodes of hyperinflation

1520
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,090
in different periods of time.

1521
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:15,240
He's also looking back to ancient history,

1522
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,070
inflationary episodes there.

1523
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:20,910
And he's saying, "This is a law of economics.

1524
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,920
This is something that recurs throughout time.

1525
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:25,560
It's not historical, it's not contingent,

1526
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:27,300
it's a law of economics."

1527
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:31,837
And you know, his Keynesian counterpoints are saying,

1528
01:04:31,837 --> 01:04:33,930
"No, that's not relevant any longer.

1529
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,870
Maybe once it was relevant, but it's not relevant today."

1530
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:39,240
Now, in some ways they have a point,

1531
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,010
because in order to pay for World War II,

1532
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:47,430
the federal government sells a lot of bonds,

1533
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,440
it issues a lot of debt,

1534
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,670
and it wants to pay this debt back at a low interest rate.

1535
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,070
And it wants people to keep buying it.

1536
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:58,290
It wants the low interest rate

1537
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:00,390
to be competitive with other interest rates.

1538
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:01,620
So it wants, in general,

1539
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,900
low interest rates throughout the economy.

1540
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,850
And the Federal Reserve has been

1541
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,860
so discredited by the Great Depression

1542
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:11,340
that the treasury basically runs the Federal Reserve

1543
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,590
and says, "Keep interest rates low."

1544
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,030
And so that's what it's doing.

1545
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:16,320
And so the Federal Reserve

1546
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,260
has stopped being an independent entity.

1547
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:22,170
It's just a sub sort of Department of the Treasury.

1548
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:24,930
But in 1951, they negotiate

1549
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,510
what's called the Treasury-Fed Accord.

1550
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:31,080
And the Federal Reserve gets its independence,

1551
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:32,790
but it doesn't really use it,

1552
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,217
but statutorily it now has it.

1553
01:05:35,217 --> 01:05:39,750
And so most economists are just observing a regime

1554
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,850
in which the Federal Reserve has no power,

1555
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,310
a regime in which there is really little inflation,

1556
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,560
the inflation that is seen is post,

1557
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,110
there's a little burst of inflation in the Korean War.

1558
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:49,943
And they're saying,

1559
01:05:49,943 --> 01:05:51,480
"Inflation's not really important,

1560
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,560
it's not really relevant,

1561
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,960
and money's not really relevant and important."

1562
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,780
And so to break through and to make the argument,

1563
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:00,870
that's why Friedman and Schwartz go to history,

1564
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:03,900
and they're able to make that argument for history.

1565
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,810
So then Friedman is coming out with a variety

1566
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:08,493
of papers that are saying,

1567
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:12,090
"When I look at economic fluctuations,"

1568
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:13,740
he maps them side by side

1569
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,240
to fluctuations in the money supply

1570
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:16,950
and says, "Look, they fit."

1571
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:18,300
And other economists,

1572
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:21,210
remember they're building complicated mathematical models

1573
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,880
and Friedman's doing extremely simple stuff,

1574
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,880
and they just think it's dumb, it's not interesting,

1575
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,703
it's not true, they don't buy it at all.

1576
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:34,020
But after a monetary history of the United States,

1577
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,550
they have to pay attention.

1578
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:37,350
So it's really in those years,

1579
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:39,450
Friedman is hammering this idea of monetarism,

1580
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:44,450
and it starts to become something respectable,

1581
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,960
bordering on respectable,

1582
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,510
for other economists to look to and think about.

1583
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:50,310
And that's really the beginning

1584
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:52,860
of the kind of Keynesian-monetarist split,

1585
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,010
where if you start to give Friedman any credence,

1586
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:58,230
you're heading towards a monetarist position.

1587
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:00,750
Now, at the same time,

1588
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:04,100
Friedman comes out very publicly in 1964

1589
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,780
as a supporter of Barry Goldwater.

1590
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,080
And Keynesian economics has found a home

1591
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,970
in the Democratic Party.

1592
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:13,230
Its probably brightest moment

1593
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,410
in the sun is the administration of John F. Kennedy,

1594
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:18,600
who brings in a lot of Harvard

1595
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,210
and Yale professors to the Council of Economic Advisors.

1596
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:23,130
He proposes a series

1597
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,680
of spending programs that are really guided

1598
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,600
by the Keynesian philosophy.

1599
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,680
And Barry Goldwater is tremendously controversial,

1600
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,810
part for his votes against civil rights,

1601
01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:35,160
which Friedman really supports,

1602
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,040
part because he's a hardcore libertarian

1603
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,130
in an age when that's not in the political mainstream

1604
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:43,440
or not discussed in the political mainstream.

1605
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,450
And, I mean, he's just tremendously unpopular,

1606
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,790
particularly in all the educated precincts

1607
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,623
where Friedman lives.

1608
01:07:48,623 --> 01:07:50,730
So Friedman is like an outcast

1609
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:53,370
and a pariah for his support of Goldwater.

1610
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,950
And so that actually really affects monetarism,

1611
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,930
because people feel

1612
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:00,600
that this is now becoming a package deal.

1613
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,550
And so there's a great reluctance

1614
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,380
to embrace Friedman's ideas,

1615
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,880
because it seems like he would then have

1616
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,503
to embrace his politics.

1617
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:09,653
- Ah.

1618
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:12,630
So it's associated with conservatism.

1619
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,900
- So this is the years when conservatism.

1620
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,779
There is a movement that calls itself conservatism.

1621
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:21,510
And Friedman is very tightly allied with this movement

1622
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:22,680
from the beginning,

1623
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,380
partly through his friendship with William F. Buckley.

1624
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:27,277
And a lot of people say to me,

1625
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:29,880
"Yeah, but Friedman's not conservative."

1626
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,620
And this is like a bigger.

1627
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,330
We could have a whole separate podcast on this.

1628
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:36,960
But for now, I'll just say that conservative

1629
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,290
in the United States becomes a political brand

1630
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:44,279
that contains elements of conservatism that are recognizable

1631
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,020
across time and space,

1632
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,029
embrace of tradition,

1633
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:50,760
more comfort with hierarchy, et cetera.

1634
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,160
And it also has something new and different,

1635
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,590
which is Friedman's ideas

1636
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:59,069
about Milton Friedman's advocacy of more free markets,

1637
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:00,450
less government regulation,

1638
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,029
and the benefits of capitalism and the benefits of freedom.

1639
01:09:03,029 --> 01:09:06,149
And that gets folded into American conservatism,

1640
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:07,920
in part because Milton Friedman

1641
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:10,380
is such a powerful intellectual figure.

1642
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,020
And after his advocacy of Goldwater,

1643
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,410
the media realizes, this guy's really smart.

1644
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:17,850
He has really interesting things to say.

1645
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:20,069
He makes great copy, he makes a great guest,

1646
01:09:20,069 --> 01:09:23,399
and he starts writing a column for "Newsweek" magazine,

1647
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:24,740
which is very big deal

1648
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,870
in a much more consolidated media environment.

1649
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,460
And he's quoted in all the newspapers.

1650
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,220
And so his public profile really starts to rise

1651
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:34,899
right as he's pushing monetarism

1652
01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:38,939
as an alternative to the Keynesian synthesis.

1653
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:40,740
- Can we just linger on,

1654
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,785
what is monetarism?

1655
01:09:42,785 --> 01:09:44,640
- [Jennifer] Yes, okay, I didn't go into it.

1656
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,840
- So, like, what? (chuckles)

1657
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,800
Okay, the money supply.

1658
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,633
- [Jennifer] Yes.

1659
01:09:47,633 --> 01:09:51,161
- So money is this thing that you can think

1660
01:09:51,161 --> 01:09:55,494
of it like a notion where people buy and sell stuff,

1661
01:09:56,670 --> 01:10:00,060
and there's this fascinating, complex dynamical system

1662
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:04,470
of people contracting with each other in this beautiful way.

1663
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:07,080
I mean, there's so many pothead questions I want to ask

1664
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,240
about the nature of money.

1665
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,397
I mean, money is fascinating in that way.

1666
01:10:11,397 --> 01:10:13,593
And I think for Milton Friedman,

1667
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,987
trusting the flow of money is really important,

1668
01:10:18,987 --> 01:10:21,540
and the signals that pricing

1669
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,410
and money in general provides is really important.

1670
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:27,450
- So, yeah, and some of this,

1671
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:30,180
I could take some of this back again to Frank Knight.

1672
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,220
So one thing Frank Knight said

1673
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,187
to all his students was,

1674
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:38,187
"The market is the best allocation mechanism we have.

1675
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,730
The market is what allocates resources.

1676
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:43,650
In a situation of scarcity,

1677
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:45,990
the market allocates them the best."

1678
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:47,550
And Hayek will add to that

1679
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:51,660
by saying, "Prices are information signals,

1680
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,880
and a price sends information to buyers

1681
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,160
and sellers about how they should act."

1682
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,740
And these are two of the strongest arguments

1683
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,320
for why the government should not intervene

1684
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,850
in the price system,

1685
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,920
because it will blur information

1686
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:07,710
or because it will allocate less efficiently

1687
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:09,900
than market allocation will.

1688
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,080
And so what Friedman is really going to add to that

1689
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,430
is maybe going up a level

1690
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:17,970
and thinking in the macro about the whole economy

1691
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:22,970
and how money circulates through that economy as a whole.

1692
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:26,460
And so what he and Anna Schwartz do

1693
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,690
is they construct what are called monetary aggregates.

1694
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:32,520
This is adding together, say,

1695
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,490
all the money that's on deposit in banks

1696
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,920
and all the money that's believed to be circulating

1697
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,880
in people's wallets.

1698
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,140
And you also have to really go back in time.

1699
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,913
We don't have credit cards.

1700
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:47,520
There is a stock market,

1701
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,430
but it's tiny in terms of the number of people who invest.

1702
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:51,843
There aren't mutual funds.

1703
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,100
Like, when traveler's check are introduced,

1704
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:57,990
this is like a big deal.

1705
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:00,780
So we have a very simple monetary system.

1706
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:04,500
And so Schwartz and Milton Friedman start measuring

1707
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,120
what they call the monetary aggregates.

1708
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,790
They focus on M1 and M2,

1709
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,250
and their favorite aggregate is M2,

1710
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:13,980
which I believe is encompassing sort of deposits

1711
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:16,230
and circulating medium.

1712
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:18,330
The other thing to recall,

1713
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,830
there's some fine distinctions

1714
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:24,830
between money in savings accounts

1715
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,810
and money in checking accounts.

1716
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:31,980
And money in savings accounts can earn interest

1717
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,860
and is generally believed not to circulate,

1718
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:37,710
or money in checking accounts does not

1719
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:40,530
at that time bear interest and cannot legally bear interest,

1720
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,540
and so is thought of as circulating.

1721
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,820
And then there's different institutional architectures

1722
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:47,403
of postal savings banks and credit unions.

1723
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,040
But Friedman is, one,

1724
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,920
taking the focus to these aggregate amounts of money

1725
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,790
and saying, "These really have a lot

1726
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,970
to do with economic booms and busts.

1727
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,690
When we have an expansion in the amount of available money,

1728
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:06,510
we see an expansion in economic activity.

1729
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:08,880
When we have a contraction in available money,

1730
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,740
we have a contraction."

1731
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:15,740
And so he says, "At this stage, the government,

1732
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,350
through the mechanism of the Federal Reserve

1733
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:21,930
and its influence on interest rates,

1734
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:25,710
can either make money more cheaply available

1735
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:28,320
and more freely available in the economy,

1736
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,917
or can make money more expensive and slow things down."

1737
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,920
But the central core idea

1738
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:38,550
of monetarism is this is potentially very bad.

1739
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:42,360
If the government can hit the gas and then hit the brake,

1740
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:46,200
and hit the gas and hit the brake based on, say,

1741
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:48,510
what a politician wants

1742
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,820
or what somebody at the Federal Reserve wants,

1743
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:52,890
you have a lot of instability in the system.

1744
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:57,360
And so one of the core policy proposals

1745
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,870
of monetarism is let's grow the money supply

1746
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,940
at a steady rate.

1747
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:06,060
And in the beginning, Friedman just says K percent.

1748
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:08,580
He doesn't even put a number on it,

1749
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,500
because he says, "The number doesn't matter.

1750
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:13,050
What matters is the steadiness in the growth rate,

1751
01:14:13,050 --> 01:14:17,400
because if it's a steady growth rate, it will fade away.

1752
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,190
And then people will make economic decisions

1753
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,200
based on the fundamentals,

1754
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:25,320
not based on what they think is going to happen,

1755
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:28,350
not based on hedging against inflation

1756
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,510
or hedging against deflation.

1757
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:33,390
They'll just be able to function."

1758
01:14:33,390 --> 01:14:37,200
So this is sort of the paradox of monetary policy.

1759
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,410
When it's happening right, you don't see it,

1760
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:41,700
you don't notice it.

1761
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:43,770
When it's happening wrong, Friedman argues,

1762
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:46,320
it can just fundamentally destabilize everything.

1763
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,780
It can cause a Great Depression,

1764
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:50,040
it can cause an artificial boom.

1765
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:53,250
And so he's taking monetary policy at a time

1766
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:55,560
when most economists think it's completely irrelevant,

1767
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,130
and saying, "This is the central game of the economy."

1768
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:02,220
Now, we live in a world where we believe this

1769
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:05,670
and the Federal Reserve chair can't open their mouth

1770
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:08,250
without headlines being generated.

1771
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,290
But Friedman is saying this

1772
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:12,360
at a time when the Federal Reserve is like a mysterious

1773
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,030
and secretive organization.

1774
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:15,990
It's not well known.

1775
01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:17,880
It's not deeply appreciated.

1776
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,640
Some of the only people who appreciate the Fed's power

1777
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,450
are like hardcore rural populace

1778
01:15:24,450 --> 01:15:28,050
who have constituents who think the banks

1779
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:29,610
and money power are the problem,

1780
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:31,830
who are like throwbacks from the frontier days.

1781
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:35,550
So Friedman in the beginning has no constituency

1782
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:36,900
for this policy.

1783
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:40,230
He has no constituency for this analysis.

1784
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:43,865
And so just going back to summarize monetarism,

1785
01:15:43,865 --> 01:15:47,040
it's using the quantity theory of money

1786
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,740
to analyze the macro economy.

1787
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:53,040
It's proposing a policy of slow

1788
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,770
and steady growth in the money supply.

1789
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:59,580
And then it is arguing that inflationary episodes,

1790
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,020
when they emerge,

1791
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:04,590
are profoundly driven by changes in the money supply,

1792
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:05,763
not by anything else.

1793
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:11,763
- I mean, and going even up a level as we started,

1794
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:17,630
how epic is it to develop this idea,

1795
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:18,810
to hold this idea,

1796
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:21,900
and then to convince the United States

1797
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:24,720
of this idea that money matters,

1798
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:29,720
that today we believe is mostly correct for now.

1799
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:35,370
And so just this idea that goes against the experts

1800
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,980
and then eventually wins out

1801
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:41,370
and drives so much of the economy, the biggest,

1802
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,020
the most powerful economy in the world.

1803
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:43,920
So fascinating.

1804
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,230
- Yeah, so, I mean, that's a fascinating story.

1805
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:47,580
And so what happens

1806
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,310
is Friedman has advanced all these ideas.

1807
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,140
He's roiled the economics profession,

1808
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,690
he's built a political profile,

1809
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:57,450
and then he becomes the head

1810
01:16:57,450 --> 01:16:59,340
of the American Economics Association.

1811
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,850
And he is asked in that role to give a presidential address.

1812
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:07,320
And so he gives his presidential address, December 1967,

1813
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:11,490
and he says, "I'm going to talk about inflation,

1814
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:14,280
and I'm going to talk about the trade off

1815
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:16,560
between inflation and unemployment."

1816
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,620
And this is what's generally known as the Phillips Curve.

1817
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:20,550
And the Phillips Curve

1818
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:24,840
in its original form is derived of post World War II data.

1819
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,150
So it's derived of about 12 years of data.

1820
01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:31,560
And it shows that when inflation goes up,

1821
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,660
unemployment goes down.

1822
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:36,690
And the idea would make sense

1823
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:38,430
that as the economy is heating up

1824
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:39,840
and lots of things are happening,

1825
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,850
more and more people are getting hired.

1826
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:45,480
And so this relationship has led policymakers

1827
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:48,990
to think that sometimes inflation is good.

1828
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,970
And if you want to lower unemployment,

1829
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:54,900
you could let inflation kind of go a little bit.

1830
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,210
And in the crude forms,

1831
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,640
it becomes to seem like a menu.

1832
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:02,580
You could take your model and you could plug in,

1833
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:05,130
I want this much unemployment.

1834
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:06,120
And then it would say, "Well, great,

1835
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,377
this is how much inflation you should do."

1836
01:18:07,377 --> 01:18:10,080
And so then you would target that inflation rate.

1837
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,490
So Friedman gets up and he says, "This is wrong."

1838
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:16,440
This might work in the short term,

1839
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,450
but it's not going to work in the long term,

1840
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:22,530
because in the long term, inflation has, first of all,

1841
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,000
it has a momentum of its own.

1842
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,150
Once it gets going, it tends to build on itself.

1843
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:30,180
The accelerationist thesis, it accelerates.

1844
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,073
And once inflation gets going,

1845
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:34,890
and the reason it gets going is

1846
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:39,660
because workers go to the store

1847
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:41,130
and they see the price level has gone up,

1848
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,660
things have cost more,

1849
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:44,670
they ask for the wages to go up.

1850
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:49,670
Then people, eventually the wages will go up too high

1851
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,560
and they will no longer be hireable,

1852
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:53,700
or companies will decide,

1853
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,650
at these high wages, I can't hire as many workers.

1854
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:56,790
I'd better lay off.

1855
01:18:56,790 --> 01:19:00,360
So if inflation keeps going, eventually over the long term,

1856
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,820
it will result in high unemployment.

1857
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:05,220
So he says, "Theoretically you could end up

1858
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,440
in a situation where you have high inflation

1859
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,000
and high unemployment."

1860
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:09,833
This hasn't been seen.

1861
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,460
But he says, "Theoretically this could happen."

1862
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,897
And then he goes and he says,

1863
01:19:13,897 --> 01:19:16,800
"And the government has started expanding the money supply.

1864
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,980
It started expanding the money supply in 1966.

1865
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,830
So we're going to get a bunch of inflation,

1866
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:25,200
and then we're going to get a bunch of unemployment."

1867
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:28,110
And he estimates about how long it will take.

1868
01:19:28,110 --> 01:19:29,850
And then he says, "Once this all happens,

1869
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:32,637
it will take about 20 years to get back to normal."

1870
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:37,860
- And he predicts the stagflation of the 1970s.

1871
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:38,798
- [Jennifer] Stagflation of the,

1872
01:19:38,798 --> 01:19:41,100
- How gangster is that for an economist to do that?

1873
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:45,990
Again, against the mainstream belief represented

1874
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,490
by the Phillips Curve?

1875
01:19:47,490 --> 01:19:51,570
- Yeah, and what really makes it happen is that many

1876
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:54,510
of the economists who most deeply dislike Friedman

1877
01:19:54,510 --> 01:19:58,680
and most deeply dislike his politics in the 1970s,

1878
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,000
as they're running their models,

1879
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,620
they start to say, "Friedman's right."

1880
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:04,140
They start to see in the data that he's right.

1881
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,330
And a very parallel process happens in Britain.

1882
01:20:06,330 --> 01:20:09,930
Britain is going through a very similar burst of spending,

1883
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,950
burst of inflation.

1884
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:14,730
And so Friedman is vindicated in a very profound way,

1885
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,230
in the way that he himself said

1886
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:17,520
would be the ultimate vindication,

1887
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,800
which is my theory should predict.

1888
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,477
So that prediction of stagflation is really

1889
01:20:24,477 --> 01:20:27,300
the sort of final breakthrough of his ideas

1890
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,430
and also their importance to policy

1891
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,830
and to thinking about how we should intervene

1892
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,700
or not in the economy

1893
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:37,350
and what the role of the Federal Reserve is,

1894
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,790
because he's saying the Federal Reserve

1895
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,650
is incredibly powerful.

1896
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:42,783
And finally people start to believe him.

1897
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,320
- And I don't know if we said, but to make clear,

1898
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:50,520
stagflation means high unemployment and high inflation,

1899
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,594
which is a thing like you mentioned,

1900
01:20:52,594 --> 01:20:55,980
was not seen before, and he predicted accurately.

1901
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:59,820
And it also disproves the sort of the relationship,

1902
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:04,820
the inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation.

1903
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,080
- Yeah, now I should say the Phillips Curve

1904
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,400
is still out there.

1905
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,830
It's been expectations augmented,

1906
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:15,000
and it is relevant in the short term.

1907
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,020
But Friedman's warning is still very much apt,

1908
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:22,500
that if you get too focused on unemployment,

1909
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,540
you can let inflation out of the bag.

1910
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:26,700
And so until very recently,

1911
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:30,000
the Federal Reserve's tradition has been focusing

1912
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,460
on inflation, believing that's fundamental

1913
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,770
and that will keep unemployment low,

1914
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:37,110
rather than trying to lower unemployment

1915
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:39,420
at the cost of raising inflation.

1916
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:41,760
- Can we go back to Frank Knight

1917
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,070
and the big picture thing we started with,

1918
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,200
which is the justification of capitalism?

1919
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,033
- Yes.

1920
01:21:47,033 --> 01:21:48,780
- So as you mentioned, Milton Friedman searched

1921
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:51,570
for a moral justification of capitalism.

1922
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:56,160
Frank Knight was a big influence on Milton Friedman

1923
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,380
and including on this topic

1924
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:01,710
of understanding the moral justification of capitalism.

1925
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:04,170
I think you spoke about Knight's case

1926
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,910
for capitalism was grounded

1927
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:07,950
in the idea that the ability to act

1928
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:11,040
in the face of uncertainty creates profit,

1929
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:14,220
and it should, because taking risks should be rewarded.

1930
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,880
So, like this idea that taking risks

1931
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,890
in the face of uncertainty should create profit,

1932
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:22,233
and that becomes a justification,

1933
01:22:23,302 --> 01:22:25,620
the ethics of capitalism.

1934
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:26,670
Can you just speak to that?

1935
01:22:26,670 --> 01:22:27,503
- Yeah.

1936
01:22:27,503 --> 01:22:30,630
So Knight is talking about, where does profit come from?

1937
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:31,500
And to his mind,

1938
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,780
it comes from the entrepreneurial function

1939
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,730
and the risk-taking function.

1940
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:39,510
And so he kind of weaves that into why, you know,

1941
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:42,870
capitalism works best

1942
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:45,570
and why it's the most effective allocation machine

1943
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:48,510
and why it assigns responsibility

1944
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:51,720
in a way he believes that a socialist system never could.

1945
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:55,170
Now Knight, though, is not a booster of capitalism.

1946
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,003
It could be in part

1947
01:22:56,003 --> 01:22:58,170
because he's just a darkly pessimistic

1948
01:22:58,170 --> 01:22:59,430
kind of depressive guy.

1949
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:03,180
And so he's afraid capitalism is going to collapse

1950
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:07,230
and socialism or fascism is going to take over or communism.

1951
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:10,560
And so he kind of descends into darkness there.

1952
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,760
Friedman, as the more optimist, believes with Hayek

1953
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,610
that you can develop a different approach

1954
01:23:17,610 --> 01:23:20,250
to capitalism that would preserve the price system,

1955
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,950
preserve allocation, but build in social supports,

1956
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,230
build in a social minimum, things like this.

1957
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:26,610
But there's a moment

1958
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,170
in his career when he's really struggling

1959
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,600
to figure out like, how do I make this case for capitalism?

1960
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,480
And basically the whole sort of conservative movement,

1961
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,280
or people who we later call the conservative movement,

1962
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,440
are struggling to make this case.

1963
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,610
And he starts thinking about what makes capitalism work

1964
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:44,550
is that if you put forth effort, you get a reward.

1965
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:45,630
So then you could say, "Well,

1966
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:47,610
people get what they deserve under capitalism."

1967
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,207
But then he kind of stops and he says,

1968
01:23:49,207 --> 01:23:50,520
"That's not really true,

1969
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:53,610
because we're born with such different endowments

1970
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:55,920
and there's a huge quotient of luck, right?

1971
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,357
So some people are just in the right position

1972
01:23:57,357 --> 01:23:58,530
and some people aren't.

1973
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:02,520
So if I say capitalism is moral

1974
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,860
because people get what they deserve,

1975
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:06,540
that's not really true."

1976
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:10,560
And he also kind of has an ethical reaction,

1977
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,840
which he ends up calling an aesthetic reaction.

1978
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,410
He's kind of like, "It just doesn't feel right to say that."

1979
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:19,320
And so he struggles for a while with like, "What do I say?"

1980
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,230
And then he basically says, "Capitalism,

1981
01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:24,000
it can't be the core,

1982
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,930
discipline of the market

1983
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:26,430
can't be the core to your ethics.

1984
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:27,420
It has to be something else."

1985
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:29,730
So that's when he will decide it's freedom,

1986
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,260
it's individual freedom

1987
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,940
that's really the ethical core.

1988
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,850
And capitalism makes individual freedom possible

1989
01:24:35,850 --> 01:24:38,790
because capitalism is dedicated to maximizing that.

1990
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:43,790
And so the defense of capitalism comes through freedom.

1991
01:24:44,190 --> 01:24:47,010
And at his stage in history,

1992
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:49,893
he's able to set aside Knight's worry about inequality

1993
01:24:49,893 --> 01:24:52,380
and say, "When I look at the data,"

1994
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:55,143
and this is true for the macro data at mid-century,

1995
01:24:56,137 --> 01:24:58,410
"incomes are actually converging."

1996
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:00,960
And also if you look historically, if a country goes

1997
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,320
from say a more feudal agrarian society

1998
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,440
to a more market-based society, incomes will converge.

1999
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,910
Now, then they might start to diverge.

2000
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,020
But Friedman's in the moment

2001
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:11,910
when he's seeing the convergence.

2002
01:25:11,910 --> 01:25:14,070
And so that's what he's really focused on.

2003
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:17,310
So he believes he can justify capitalism

2004
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:19,020
through the ethic of freedom.

2005
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:19,950
And he also believes

2006
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:24,750
that inequality is a problem that can be addressed

2007
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:25,980
through specific policies,

2008
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,310
and it's not a fundamental feature of capitalism.

2009
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:30,050
In other words, he doesn't see capitalism

2010
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:33,360
as an engine of inequality the way that Frank Knight did

2011
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,440
and the way that, you know,

2012
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,210
maybe some critics on the left would.

2013
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:37,860
- How did he conceive of freedom?

2014
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,500
So individual freedom,

2015
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,830
economic freedom, political freedom, civil freedom?

2016
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:44,970
What was the tension,

2017
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:47,760
the dynamic between those different freedoms for him?

2018
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,850
- So he really begins focusing on economic freedom,

2019
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,430
and he says, "It's really important to focus

2020
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:56,160
on economic freedom, because in the United States,

2021
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,630
we don't value it enough."

2022
01:25:57,630 --> 01:25:59,400
So by economic freedom,

2023
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:04,400
he means the ability to keep what you've earned,

2024
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:06,690
the ability to make decisions about your business,

2025
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:09,030
the ability to make decisions about the work that you do.

2026
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,670
So this will translate into things like,

2027
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,320
there shouldn't be a minimum wage.

2028
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:15,630
He believes the minimum wage has bad social effects.

2029
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:18,390
But he also believes you should be free to accept a job

2030
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,640
at a wage that you yourself have determined

2031
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:21,843
is acceptable to you.

2032
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:26,670
And there should be very minimal regulation,

2033
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:28,500
questions around safety and other things,

2034
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,030
because the market will ultimately,

2035
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:32,700
if you create an unsafe product, it won't sell,

2036
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,160
and that's sort of your incentive.

2037
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:38,340
So he really centers economic freedom

2038
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:40,770
because he thinks especially, and he's really speaking

2039
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:42,990
from his vantage point in the universities

2040
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:45,900
and speaking to the kind of liberal consensus of the 50s

2041
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,050
and 60s, he thinks economic freedom has been undervalued

2042
01:26:49,050 --> 01:26:50,040
in the American context.

2043
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,050
So he really wants to push that forward.

2044
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:55,110
He's really kind of taking political freedom for granted.

2045
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:57,120
Now, later in his career, when he becomes famous,

2046
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,720
he's traveling the world, he spends time in Chile.

2047
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:04,260
And this country is now being ruled by a dictator,

2048
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:07,680
Gustav Pinochet, who starts introducing economic freedom,

2049
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,510
but there's no political freedom.

2050
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:12,000
And Milton Friedman believes eventually these two things

2051
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,647
are going to go together and tells Pinochet,

2052
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:16,350
"You've got economic freedom,

2053
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:17,643
and eventually it's going to bring,

2054
01:27:17,643 --> 01:27:19,590
it's going to mean political freedom."

2055
01:27:19,590 --> 01:27:20,820
Pinochet is like, "Okay, fine,

2056
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,720
not really interested in that.

2057
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:23,327
I want to know what I should do about inflation."

2058
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:24,360
(Lex and Jennifer laughing)

2059
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:26,370
But then when Milton Friedman leaves Chile,

2060
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:31,020
he is attacked and vilified for having been a supporter.

2061
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:32,640
He's interpreted that he's a supporter

2062
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:34,530
of the regime, which he's not.

2063
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:36,600
But he realizes he has talked too much

2064
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:37,620
about economic freedom,

2065
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:39,510
and he hasn't talked enough about political freedom.

2066
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:41,550
He's kind of assumed political freedom,

2067
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:43,770
because he's come from the American context.

2068
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:46,717
So then he starts recalibrating them and saying,

2069
01:27:46,717 --> 01:27:48,810
"You know what, if you don't have political freedom,

2070
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:49,643
you're never going to be able

2071
01:27:49,643 --> 01:27:51,450
to hold on to economic freedom."

2072
01:27:51,450 --> 01:27:54,000
So he sees that they need to go together

2073
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,830
and they don't naturally go together.

2074
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:59,010
And so he starts to become more clear in talking

2075
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:01,230
about political freedom.

2076
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:03,450
Now let's fast forward to the end of his life

2077
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:05,910
and he's witnessing the emergence

2078
01:28:05,910 --> 01:28:07,230
of what we call the Asian Tigers.

2079
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:11,820
So capitalist economies that are doing very well,

2080
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,220
but they don't have political freedom,

2081
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,830
but then he observes, they don't have political freedom

2082
01:28:16,830 --> 01:28:20,220
and that you can't vote in a free and fair election,

2083
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:23,670
but they also don't have a Stasi, they don't have a KGB,

2084
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:27,510
they're not hauling people off for their wrong opinions.

2085
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:30,720
So then he says they have something called civic freedom.

2086
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,700
And so he kind of defines this third sphere,

2087
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:36,000
civic freedom of, you know, debate, discussion,

2088
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,050
interpersonal relations,

2089
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,280
but you can't be political.

2090
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:42,390
So this is a late in life addition.

2091
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:44,070
I don't think it's fully theorized.

2092
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:47,130
I think what it shows is that during the Cold War,

2093
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:50,250
he very much believed economic and political freedom,

2094
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:54,300
you know, capitalism and freedom, democracy,

2095
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,860
the United States, capitalism.

2096
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:57,360
This all went together.

2097
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,193
And he starts to see

2098
01:28:58,193 --> 01:28:59,430
at the end of his life the emergence

2099
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:02,520
of different social systems that are using market trading

2100
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:05,850
and allocation but aren't giving people similar freedoms.

2101
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:07,500
And he's kind of puzzling over that.

2102
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:10,980
Now, he always believes that China will democratize,

2103
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:14,190
and he thinks China's on the path to democratization,

2104
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:16,800
in part because Chile does democratize.

2105
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,200
Eventually Pinochet has voted out

2106
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:20,730
and it's become a democratic,

2107
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,890
capitalist, and very prosperous country.

2108
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,930
And he thinks that's exactly what's happening in China.

2109
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:28,380
He sees Tiananmen, and he hasn't lived long enough

2110
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:29,670
to get to where we are now

2111
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,830
in which doesn't look like political

2112
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:34,950
or civic freedom is coming to China anytime soon.

2113
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:38,430
- And he did oppose the dual-track system of China,

2114
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:41,250
meaning like the market is bottom-up,

2115
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:45,090
the government in China is top-down,

2116
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:46,706
and you can't have both.

2117
01:29:46,706 --> 01:29:48,433
- He thought you couldn't have both.

2118
01:29:48,433 --> 01:29:51,660
He thought eventually the market would triumph.

2119
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,400
- Well, that's a really powerful idea.

2120
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:56,070
Say, okay, maybe there's not political freedom,

2121
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:58,260
but just hold on to the economic freedom

2122
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,910
and eventually that's going to give political freedom.

2123
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:03,870
Is that correct to say, like,

2124
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:06,203
start to work on the economic freedom

2125
01:30:06,203 --> 01:30:09,270
and the political freedom piece will take care of itself?

2126
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,320
- That's what he believed.

2127
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,640
That's what he believed, yeah.

2128
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:14,850
I think it's it's more complicated than that.

2129
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,276
The people who gain

2130
01:30:16,276 --> 01:30:20,100
out of a system of economic freedom could decide to collude

2131
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:23,190
in a system where there isn't political freedom.

2132
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:24,990
That's certainly a scenario.

2133
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:28,830
But again, that's that core idea of freedom.

2134
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:32,250
And that core belief that people want freedom

2135
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,740
and that people are drawn to freedom.

2136
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:36,750
- Just to go back to Frank Knight a little bit,

2137
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,810
he wrote an essay called "The Ethics of Competition."

2138
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:42,240
The metaphor that economic life is a game,

2139
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:44,700
and then maybe that extends to society as a whole.

2140
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,750
The entirety of it is a competitive game.

2141
01:30:49,428 --> 01:30:52,740
And Milton Friedman, I think, adapted some of this,

2142
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,000
appreciated some of this.

2143
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,290
Can you speak to this metaphor?

2144
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:56,910
- Yeah, I think what the metaphor

2145
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,970
of the game does is it asks you, okay, well,

2146
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:02,100
what are the rules, then?

2147
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,610
And let's focus on the rules that keep the game going.

2148
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:07,800
So he didn't use the concept of an infinite game,

2149
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:09,630
but I think that's an interesting one.

2150
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,130
A game that all the players are in

2151
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:13,350
and keep going again and again and again.

2152
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,953
And so that helped Knight, along with Hayek,

2153
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:21,720
shift from the allocation question,

2154
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,630
who's getting what, are things allocated fairly,

2155
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:27,000
to the more structural question of,

2156
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,380
what are the rules of the game

2157
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,470
that we need to keep this system going?

2158
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:34,260
And so for a while, that led to the discussion of Monopoly.

2159
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,813
Well, we need rules against concentration,

2160
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:40,350
or we need the rule of law.

2161
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:42,600
Everyone needs to be treated equally.

2162
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:46,920
People need to know what they're up against.

2163
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,680
And then going back to monetarism,

2164
01:31:49,680 --> 01:31:52,440
the core of monetarism is a rule.

2165
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:55,290
Friedman called it a monetary growth rule.

2166
01:31:55,290 --> 01:32:00,290
And so, again, what keeps the economic game going is a rule

2167
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:04,500
about how much the money grows that everybody knows,

2168
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,030
nobody's guessing,

2169
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:08,580
nobody's changing the rules to help their side

2170
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,160
or to help the people they're friendly with.

2171
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,530
We all know it's there, it's clear, it's easy.

2172
01:32:13,530 --> 01:32:17,190
And so that emphasis on rules, I think,

2173
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:18,420
really has a through line.

2174
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,670
It goes into Hayek's competitive order,

2175
01:32:20,670 --> 01:32:23,370
and then it goes into the monetary growth rule.

2176
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:25,713
And then today,

2177
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:30,990
monetary policy makes use of monetary policy rules.

2178
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:33,330
We have not abandoned discretionary,

2179
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:36,000
but rules are used as a heuristic or a check.

2180
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,520
And those come out of Friedman's thinking.

2181
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:43,520
And so it's really profound.

2182
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:47,190
And it was always counterposed to discretion,

2183
01:32:47,190 --> 01:32:50,640
which Friedman worried would be subject to capture

2184
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,050
or political corruption.

2185
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:53,850
If you had discretion in policymaking,

2186
01:32:53,850 --> 01:32:56,493
or if you had discretion in these very big areas,

2187
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:00,060
then people would stop competing

2188
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:01,620
against each other in a market,

2189
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:03,810
and they would turn their attention

2190
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:06,210
to getting control of the rules

2191
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:07,860
or the rule makers.

2192
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:10,233
- So if there's clear, transparent rules,

2193
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:13,620
then you're free to play the game.

2194
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:15,300
- Yes, exactly.

2195
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:18,750
- But then depending on the rules, the game can turn out,

2196
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:21,510
the equilibrium that it arrives at might be different.

2197
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:24,900
So that speaks to the mechanism, design,

2198
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:26,269
the design of the rules.

2199
01:33:26,269 --> 01:33:27,102
- Yeah.

2200
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:27,935
And that was, again,

2201
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:32,400
to go back to the idea separating new liberalism

2202
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,710
or neoliberalism from classical liberalism was more

2203
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:37,290
of a focus on what are the rules that are needed,

2204
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:40,590
what is the competitive order that we want to set out,

2205
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:42,903
how do we design in social safeguards,

2206
01:33:44,010 --> 01:33:45,000
how do we think about it?

2207
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,170
And so that shift towards monetary policy

2208
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,180
and focusing on stable monetary growth,

2209
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:54,570
that becomes really important in the post-70s era

2210
01:33:54,570 --> 01:33:56,280
as one of the basic rules

2211
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,500
of how capitalist economy should function.

2212
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:00,720
And it becomes really important

2213
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,660
because they see the example of, say, countries,

2214
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:05,220
most notably in Latin America,

2215
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:07,950
where monetary rules weren't followed

2216
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:11,400
and different governments played politics

2217
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:12,720
with their currencies.

2218
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:17,460
And that created just huge upheaval and huge social loss,

2219
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:20,460
economic loss, just economic disaster.

2220
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,920
- So my friend, she's a poker player,

2221
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,120
philosopher of sorts,

2222
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:27,480
great human being, she has a podcast called "Win-Win"

2223
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:28,740
that everybody should listen to.

2224
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,930
And the whole purpose of the podcast

2225
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:32,430
and her whole way of being

2226
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:34,860
in spirit is to find win-win solutions.

2227
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:37,350
So do you think of economic life

2228
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:40,740
as having such win-win solutions?

2229
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:44,430
So being able to find rules where everybody wins,

2230
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:47,070
or is it always going to be zero sum?

2231
01:34:47,070 --> 01:34:49,860
- I definitely believe in win-win,

2232
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:51,540
but with a big asterisk.

2233
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:53,730
You can have win-win,

2234
01:34:53,730 --> 01:34:56,460
but it can feel like win-lose, which is,

2235
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:00,450
it's not just are people getting more,

2236
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:03,630
it has a lot to do with do people feel they're getting more

2237
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:06,480
and do people feel they're getting what's fair and equal?

2238
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:11,480
So you could have a situation, for instance,

2239
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:15,510
if you look at the history of going back to Chile,

2240
01:35:15,510 --> 01:35:19,560
it has steady growth, steady income growth,

2241
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:22,080
steady diminution of inequality,

2242
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:25,020
and a high level of discontent within the society

2243
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:28,590
and a high level of belief that the society is corrupt

2244
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:31,560
and unfair, and that's what matters.

2245
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:35,430
How people feel about it, how people perceive it matters.

2246
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:37,950
And you can't, you know, we saw this recently,

2247
01:35:37,950 --> 01:35:40,260
you can't just come out with a bunch of statistics

2248
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:43,140
and tell people, "You're winning in this game,"

2249
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:44,850
if they feel like they're losing.

2250
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:47,940
So that goes to all the non-rational factors

2251
01:35:47,940 --> 01:35:52,020
and all the comparative factors that people have

2252
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:52,853
when they think

2253
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:56,340
about where they are vis-a-vis other people in society.

2254
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:58,140
So we're just incredibly social creatures.

2255
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:01,080
We're incredibly attuned to our status,

2256
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,320
to rising and falling, to where we sit vis-a-vis others.

2257
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,170
And so that absolutely has to be attended to.

2258
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:09,660
It can't just be an economic analysis.

2259
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:12,780
- That's so interesting that the experience

2260
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:16,230
of the economy is different than the reality of the economy.

2261
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:19,530
On the topic of corruption, I think the reality

2262
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:23,400
of corruption versus the perception of corruption

2263
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:25,290
is really important in a lot of these nations.

2264
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:27,630
You take Ukraine for example,

2265
01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:30,630
the perception of corruption has a big impact

2266
01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:31,500
on the economy.

2267
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,790
You don't want to invest,

2268
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:34,860
you're very cautious as a business person.

2269
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:36,750
The reality of corruption could be way different

2270
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,220
than the actual perception.

2271
01:36:38,220 --> 01:36:40,636
But if narratives take hold,

2272
01:36:40,636 --> 01:36:45,390
it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that it has a big effect

2273
01:36:45,390 --> 01:36:47,700
on the psychology of the people involved.

2274
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:48,533
It's interesting.

2275
01:36:48,533 --> 01:36:51,510
- Yeah, I mean, this goes back to Keynes' analysis

2276
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:52,980
of the Great Depression, right?

2277
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,950
If people won't invest, if they're spooked,

2278
01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:57,873
if the investing classes are spooked,

2279
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:00,000
you could be in real trouble.

2280
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,870
And in some ways this simple analysis of the problem

2281
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:06,900
and proposal of a solution was enough

2282
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:11,640
to restore eventually the path to economic prosperity.

2283
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,907
That's Franklin Roosevelt,

2284
01:37:12,907 --> 01:37:14,730
"Nothing to fear, but fear itself."

2285
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:17,070
You know, the sense of, we know we have a future,

2286
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,990
we have optimism, then you believe in it.

2287
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:21,960
And to go back to like thinking about money, right?

2288
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:24,360
Money works because we all believe in it.

2289
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,640
You know, it's a form of social trust,

2290
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,470
and it's a form of belief

2291
01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:31,860
and faith in our society and in the other people in it.

2292
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:33,030
And when that breaks down,

2293
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:34,710
the money system will break down as well.

2294
01:37:34,710 --> 01:37:37,290
- Is there something that Milton Friedman said

2295
01:37:37,290 --> 01:37:38,757
and thought about, you know,

2296
01:37:38,757 --> 01:37:42,213
how to control the psychology of humans at scale?

2297
01:37:42,213 --> 01:37:43,140
- No.

2298
01:37:43,140 --> 01:37:45,660
I mean, what's interesting is he does talk,

2299
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:47,700
especially in his later work,

2300
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:52,530
he says, "We have fiat currency and this is an experiment,"

2301
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:55,410
you know, "And we don't know how it's going to turn out.

2302
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:57,030
And it's turning out okay right now.

2303
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:58,942
But we've always had a commodity-based

2304
01:37:58,942 --> 01:38:01,980
or backed currency of some form or another.

2305
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:04,950
And this is the first time.

2306
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,410
And so who really knows?

2307
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:09,360
So far so good."

2308
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,280
And he also is very attuned.

2309
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:13,260
It's interesting in his later writings when he's thinking

2310
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:15,000
about this too, "Sure,

2311
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,180
I could design a monetary system that would be different,

2312
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:20,160
but when I look at history,

2313
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:22,800
I see that monetary systems have always, say,

2314
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,662
incorporated the role of a state,

2315
01:38:24,662 --> 01:38:26,670
because it's so important to people.

2316
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:29,550
And so therefore my theoretical designs

2317
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:30,630
really have to be tempered

2318
01:38:30,630 --> 01:38:33,420
by what I've actually seen happen in history."

2319
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:36,720
- So maybe you could speak to this tension

2320
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:40,110
between how much government intervention is okay

2321
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,040
for Milton Friedman.

2322
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:42,930
So he was against minimum wage,

2323
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:45,720
but he was for guaranteed minimum income.

2324
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,120
Can you explain actually the difference between the two?

2325
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:50,580
- Yeah, so this was one of the discoveries

2326
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:51,540
I made in my research.

2327
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:54,900
I found a paper from 1938 he wrote advocating

2328
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,270
what we would call today a universal basic income,

2329
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,710
a minimum income.

2330
01:38:58,710 --> 01:39:00,600
And he basically sees this

2331
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,260
as part of the effort to create a new liberalism.

2332
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:05,093
And he basically says,

2333
01:39:05,093 --> 01:39:07,290
"We have advanced societies,

2334
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:09,540
we have prosperous societies.

2335
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:12,240
We have decided in keeping with our morals

2336
01:39:12,240 --> 01:39:15,030
and our ethics that people should not be starving

2337
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:16,830
in an advanced society like this.

2338
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:19,530
The question is, how are we going to make that happen?"

2339
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,900
And he ended up believing the best thing

2340
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,960
to do was to put a floor under everybody.

2341
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,770
And he said, you can get that based on your income.

2342
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:31,080
If you have a lot of income, you don't get it.

2343
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,640
If you have a little income,

2344
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:33,660
you might get a little bit of it.

2345
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:36,420
If you have no income, you get enough of it.

2346
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:38,820
And he believed in the beginning you should base that

2347
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:41,700
on what was required to buy food.

2348
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:43,140
That that would be kind of an objective.

2349
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:45,540
You could objectively determine the nutrition

2350
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,373
and the price of food.

2351
01:39:46,373 --> 01:39:49,740
And so that for him, it's important,

2352
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:52,050
he says, "It's keeping with a liberal polity,

2353
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:55,200
because it's not intervening in the price system,

2354
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,110
it's not intervening in economic relations."

2355
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:00,270
And it does not, in his view,

2356
01:40:00,270 --> 01:40:02,790
require a bureaucracy to administer.

2357
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:04,200
It is not, in his view,

2358
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,750
require that you qualify for it

2359
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:09,540
by virtue of being in a protected class.

2360
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:13,590
You just get it as kind of part of your membership

2361
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,570
in this general citizenship body.

2362
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:20,520
And so that to him was really different than a minimum wage,

2363
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,990
because it did not interfere with the work bargain.

2364
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:27,750
His belief about minimum wages was specifically

2365
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,720
that it priced out unskilled labor.

2366
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,310
That what an unskilled laborer had

2367
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:35,670
to offer was a willingness to work for a very low wage.

2368
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:39,570
And if you set the minimum wage too high, businesses,

2369
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:42,356
instead of hiring that higher priced labor

2370
01:40:42,356 --> 01:40:45,750
would not hire or like we could think of today, right?

2371
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:47,670
They put in an electronic checkout, you know,

2372
01:40:47,670 --> 01:40:48,630
or something like this,

2373
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:50,340
where you don't actually need the labor.

2374
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,230
So he really believed the minimum wage

2375
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:54,420
had that perverse incentive.

2376
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:58,560
Now, this is a live debate on what minimum wages do.

2377
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:01,290
And there seems to be a level at which you can set them

2378
01:41:01,290 --> 01:41:04,110
that they cannot have that perverse effect

2379
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:06,240
and in fact can kind of create people

2380
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:08,550
with more spending money that then powers the economy.

2381
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:12,870
So he had a very sort of clinical analysis of that,

2382
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:14,250
rather than an empirical one,

2383
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:16,320
or a really abstract analysis,

2384
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,680
but the minimum income is fascinating

2385
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:22,230
because it seems very leftist to us,

2386
01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:26,070
but what it is is it's purely individualistic.

2387
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:27,990
And it never really happened,

2388
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:31,080
because it was so purely individualistic,

2389
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:35,340
because American social policy typically identifies

2390
01:41:35,340 --> 01:41:37,470
like this group of people is deserving

2391
01:41:37,470 --> 01:41:38,580
and will give them benefits.

2392
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:41,460
So the classic example is soldiers, veterans.

2393
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:45,480
Another example is mothers raising dependent children.

2394
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,860
These people deserve money.

2395
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:49,320
The rest of you, you better go out and work.

2396
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:52,410
And so Friedman's proposal, it really caught on in the 60s.

2397
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:55,443
It ultimately went nowhere, but it was no litmus test,

2398
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:58,770
no income analysis,

2399
01:41:58,770 --> 01:42:00,900
just, we're gonna give you this much.

2400
01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:02,430
Everyone's gonna get this much.

2401
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:04,920
And he decided once mass taxation had come in,

2402
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:06,600
you could do it through taxes,

2403
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:07,890
and you could just rebate people

2404
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:10,770
who didn't pay income taxes got a rebate.

2405
01:42:10,770 --> 01:42:11,820
That actually came to pass.

2406
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:13,500
It's the earned income tax credit,

2407
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:17,370
and it's considered extremely successful by policy analysts.

2408
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:18,675
It does what it's supposed to do.

2409
01:42:18,675 --> 01:42:20,250
It's not that expensive.

2410
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:24,690
And so I see that as a kind of paradigm of his thinking

2411
01:42:24,690 --> 01:42:26,310
in that instead

2412
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:29,520
of creating a bureaucracy that does some form

2413
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,510
of redistribution,

2414
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:34,470
or instead of trying to intervene in the market for labor

2415
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:35,880
or the market for something else,

2416
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,590
the market for housing,

2417
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:41,970
you provide a cash grant that people spend for themselves.

2418
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:44,880
And so, interestingly, that's what happened

2419
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,070
in the emergency situation of Covid.

2420
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,450
That's exactly what people did.

2421
01:42:48,450 --> 01:42:49,440
They followed that model.

2422
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,390
We just get money out quick.

2423
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:54,630
And there's a lot of discussion still about UBI,

2424
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:56,370
is this something that should be done?

2425
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:59,070
And I think it's always going to be hard to pull off,

2426
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:02,130
because I think Americans

2427
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:04,500
and their elected representatives don't want

2428
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,970
to provide a universal benefit.

2429
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:07,560
They want to provide a targeted benefit

2430
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,740
because they believe there's a moral component here.

2431
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:15,330
And Friedman advanced a policy that was really abstract

2432
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:18,360
and really just, you know, kind of,

2433
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:19,530
it was devoid of judgment.

2434
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:21,150
It was pure and beautiful in that way,

2435
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:23,070
but utterly impractical.

2436
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:26,392
- And it really focused on not interfering with the market

2437
01:43:26,392 --> 01:43:28,860
and the signals that the market provides.

2438
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:30,750
Like, it was really against price controls

2439
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,070
for the same kind of reason.

2440
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:33,450
- Yeah, exactly.

2441
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:34,770
You could say, "Okay,

2442
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:37,080
but how does this not interfere with the market?

2443
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,820
If you provide people with a minimum income,

2444
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:41,910
won't that change their incentives to work, et cetera?"

2445
01:43:41,910 --> 01:43:44,460
I mean, there's a big, big body of research on this.

2446
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:47,700
Most of it seems to show, one,

2447
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:50,640
it's way better than the current benefits cliff,

2448
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:54,150
where you have to not work to get your benefits,

2449
01:43:54,150 --> 01:43:57,060
and any incentive impact

2450
01:43:57,060 --> 01:44:00,060
on working seems to be much lower than would be expected.

2451
01:44:00,060 --> 01:44:03,480
But I'll let the economists

2452
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:05,490
and the social scientists fight that one out

2453
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:06,600
and figure it out empirically.

2454
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:07,950
Hopefully we should be able to.

2455
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,420
- Yeah, there's been a bunch of studies.

2456
01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:11,910
It's interesting, even just how you conduct studies

2457
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:14,190
like this, how you do these kinds of experiments,

2458
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:18,600
especially if you're empirically minded, you know,

2459
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:20,250
because a lot of the studies I saw

2460
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,810
is they're pretty small.

2461
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:22,643
- Right.

2462
01:44:22,643 --> 01:44:25,350
- So how do you make big conclusions

2463
01:44:25,350 --> 01:44:28,410
about how to run the world,

2464
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:31,800
how to run the economies from such small studies?

2465
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:35,850
It's all a fascinating experiment of ideas.

2466
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:39,400
And it's also inspiring to see individuals

2467
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:42,300
and maybe small groups

2468
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:45,720
of individuals like the Chicago School of Economics,

2469
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:49,047
to sort of shake up what we believe

2470
01:44:49,047 --> 01:44:51,210
and how we run the world.

2471
01:44:51,210 --> 01:44:52,043
Inspiring.

2472
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:55,320
You call Milton Friedman

2473
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,983
the last great conservative, (chuckles)

2474
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,100
maybe to be a little bit sort of controversial

2475
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:05,370
and make bold statements that get everybody excited.

2476
01:45:05,370 --> 01:45:06,930
But what do you mean by that

2477
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:09,300
and what makes a great conservative?

2478
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,340
- So I was really thinking of that

2479
01:45:11,340 --> 01:45:14,550
in terms of kind of American political identities

2480
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:18,300
and particularly the 20th century conservative movement,

2481
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,987
which, you know, people are always saying,

2482
01:45:19,987 --> 01:45:21,376
"This isn't conservatism."

2483
01:45:21,376 --> 01:45:22,209
And I was like,

2484
01:45:22,209 --> 01:45:23,970
"Yes, in America, conservatism is different."

2485
01:45:23,970 --> 01:45:26,280
It looks different, it feels different.

2486
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,610
Conservatism in America builds in a big component

2487
01:45:29,610 --> 01:45:32,130
of what we could call libertarianism,

2488
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:35,610
pro-capitalism, anti-government ideas.

2489
01:45:35,610 --> 01:45:37,177
And critics will say,

2490
01:45:37,177 --> 01:45:40,830
"But conservatism is about conserving institutions

2491
01:45:40,830 --> 01:45:43,320
and practices and it has a role for the state

2492
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:44,940
and an organic community."

2493
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:46,950
But in the United States, it's always had,

2494
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:50,943
since the 20th century, also this anti-statist,

2495
01:45:52,350 --> 01:45:54,600
let's let the market rip.

2496
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:55,433
Let's not worry

2497
01:45:55,433 --> 01:45:57,690
about what the market does to establish traditions.

2498
01:45:57,690 --> 01:45:58,830
The market is our tradition.

2499
01:45:58,830 --> 01:46:00,600
Capitalism is our tradition.

2500
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:03,000
So that was really synthesized.

2501
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,920
You know, many people were there,

2502
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,293
but Friedman and the importance of his books,

2503
01:46:08,227 --> 01:46:11,640
"Free to Choose," "Capitalism and Freedom,"

2504
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,530
the television series he did,

2505
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:15,780
all of these were like core components

2506
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:19,260
of this American conservative synthesis as it evolved.

2507
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:22,260
And I really see that as having broken down.

2508
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:25,740
It is scattered into different pieces

2509
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:26,573
and we don't know

2510
01:46:26,573 --> 01:46:29,520
where they're gonna come back together again.

2511
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:34,520
But Friedman's push for open global markets,

2512
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:35,910
unfettered free trade,

2513
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:38,660
that's getting pushback on both the left and the right.

2514
01:46:40,650 --> 01:46:42,690
That I think is just a major sign

2515
01:46:42,690 --> 01:46:45,120
that both parties have turned away from this division.

2516
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,730
I don't know what they've turned to,

2517
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:50,760
but the way that Friedman brought these pieces together,

2518
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:52,590
I think that political moment has passed.

2519
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:54,790
So that's what I was trying to talk about

2520
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:56,970
with the book title.

2521
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:57,870
There's another way, though,

2522
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:00,360
in which I think of him also as a conservative,

2523
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:03,720
which is that within the field of economics,

2524
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:05,370
he went back to this older idea,

2525
01:47:05,370 --> 01:47:07,327
the quantity theory of money, and said,

2526
01:47:07,327 --> 01:47:09,540
"This still has value.

2527
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,640
This can be applied in the modern day.

2528
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,440
It is something to teach us."

2529
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:15,450
And he pushed back

2530
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:17,940
against this trend towards mathematization.

2531
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:19,530
So he kept writing books.

2532
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:22,350
You can still pick up a Friedman book and read it,

2533
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:24,810
whereas lots of economics articles and output,

2534
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:26,940
it's like unreadable unless you're in the field.

2535
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,320
And so I think in that way,

2536
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,870
he was trying to conserve methodologically

2537
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:35,070
and intellectually the traditions of the field.

2538
01:47:35,070 --> 01:47:38,340
The work that he and particularly Anna Schwartz did,

2539
01:47:38,340 --> 01:47:40,560
that literal counting of things

2540
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:43,440
and deep analysis of data from the field,

2541
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:45,720
that was completely unfashionable in his time.

2542
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,237
Now we've sort of gone back to it with big data

2543
01:47:47,237 --> 01:47:48,990
and with computers.

2544
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:50,940
But he helped bring that forward

2545
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:52,080
and preserve that tradition.

2546
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,010
So I think of him kind of intellectually as a conservative,

2547
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:58,140
if you think of the mode of his thought.

2548
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:01,140
And so, I mean, what makes a great conservative

2549
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:03,210
is one who takes those older ideas

2550
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:05,850
and makes them fresh for a new time period.

2551
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:09,720
I think that's exactly what he did.

2552
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:10,553
- You've also spoken

2553
01:48:10,553 --> 01:48:14,820
about the fact that the times when he was sort of out

2554
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:19,110
in public, there was more of an open battle

2555
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:23,250
of ideas where conservatism often had,

2556
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:27,160
William F. Buckley, he had a more vibrant,

2557
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:35,013
deep debate over ideas where it seems less deep now.

2558
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,850
- I mean, that is the thing that it's hard,

2559
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:42,037
especially for the students I teach today, to be like,

2560
01:48:42,037 --> 01:48:44,220
"You know, there were arguments about ideas,

2561
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:46,320
and conservatives want a bunch of them."

2562
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,050
You know, and that happened in the 70s

2563
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:52,230
and late 1960s to 1970s when they, you know,

2564
01:48:52,230 --> 01:48:54,120
one set of arguments was about economics.

2565
01:48:54,120 --> 01:48:57,060
Like, okay, this idea of stimulating the economy

2566
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:59,070
by spending more, it has a downside.

2567
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:00,723
The downside is called inflation,

2568
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:05,370
and the downside's called too much regulation.

2569
01:49:05,370 --> 01:49:08,160
And you've gone too far

2570
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,710
in kind of bottling up the actual sources

2571
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:12,420
of economic growth and dynamism,

2572
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:14,013
and we have to let those free.

2573
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,675
In social policy, there was also a critique.

2574
01:49:17,675 --> 01:49:20,130
The Great Society had all these ways

2575
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:21,870
of ideas of ending poverty.

2576
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:24,277
And people came and analyzed them and said,

2577
01:49:24,277 --> 01:49:25,890
"The programs aren't helping.

2578
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:26,723
In some ways,

2579
01:49:26,723 --> 01:49:29,340
you've actually created engines to trap people in poverty,

2580
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:31,440
because you've given them a benefit

2581
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,940
and said if they actually start to work,

2582
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:34,170
they lose the benefit.

2583
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:36,900
You've created all these perverse incentives."

2584
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:38,280
And these ideas were fought out.

2585
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,460
They were empirical, they were controversial,

2586
01:49:41,460 --> 01:49:43,890
and they were based on really deep research

2587
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:45,390
and really deep argumentation.

2588
01:49:45,390 --> 01:49:49,800
And so it seems that era has passed.

2589
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:53,740
It seems like we're driven much more quickly

2590
01:49:55,530 --> 01:49:57,507
by moods rather than thought through ideas.

2591
01:49:57,507 --> 01:50:01,761
Right now, it seems like the ideas come after.

2592
01:50:01,761 --> 01:50:03,720
They follow the political mood

2593
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:06,810
and try to put together the underpinning of it,

2594
01:50:06,810 --> 01:50:08,460
where it really was the opposite

2595
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,960
for much of the 20th century.

2596
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,050
- It does seem like we lead with emotional turmoil.

2597
01:50:13,050 --> 01:50:13,883
- Right.

2598
01:50:13,883 --> 01:50:16,770
- And the ideas follow, versus lead with the ideas,

2599
01:50:16,770 --> 01:50:20,160
and the sort of the emotion of the masses respond.

2600
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,993
- Right, exactly.

2601
01:50:20,993 --> 01:50:22,980
So if we think of the evolution of conservatism,

2602
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:27,450
it was a whole set of ideas that was crafted, refined.

2603
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:30,360
The 1950s, 1960s, 1970s,

2604
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:33,660
sort of really found their emotional standard bearer,

2605
01:50:33,660 --> 01:50:37,530
translator, salesperson in Ronald Reagan,

2606
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:38,460
who, incidentally,

2607
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:40,710
had been following these ideas as they developed

2608
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:43,350
and had been honing his ability to express them

2609
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:45,360
and apply them politically.

2610
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,680
It's a very opposite,

2611
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:50,400
if we look at Trump as the political definer of the era,

2612
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,840
there's a set of ideas,

2613
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:56,280
but it was more attitudes, impulses, vibes,

2614
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:58,440
and the ideas are coming after that,

2615
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:00,660
trying to figure out how they patch on.

2616
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:05,520
So it's interesting to watch, to see that difference.

2617
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,770
And I hazard that a lot

2618
01:51:07,770 --> 01:51:09,600
of it just has to do with the immediacy

2619
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:11,220
of the media environment we're in,

2620
01:51:11,220 --> 01:51:13,110
and it's just power

2621
01:51:13,110 --> 01:51:16,980
of the media messages to get out so fast.

2622
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:18,750
- What do you think Milton Friedman would say

2623
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:19,740
about Donald Trump,

2624
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:24,540
about him winning in 2024,

2625
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:26,730
and just in general,

2626
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:28,140
this political moment?

2627
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:29,820
- I think he would love Doge.

2628
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:31,121
I think that's, you know,

2629
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:31,954
(Lex and Jennifer laugh)

2630
01:51:31,954 --> 01:51:33,062
it goes without saying. - He would focus on that part?

2631
01:51:33,062 --> 01:51:34,337
- I think he would focus on that part,

2632
01:51:34,337 --> 01:51:36,840
because I think he would really love it.

2633
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:40,470
He would be very alarmed by the idea of tariffs

2634
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:43,710
and very alarmed by the return to protectionism.

2635
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:45,690
I mean, I think he believed that part

2636
01:51:45,690 --> 01:51:48,450
of what made the world peaceful

2637
01:51:48,450 --> 01:51:50,820
in the second half of the 20th century,

2638
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:53,520
as opposed to during World War II,

2639
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,520
was the world was knit together more by trade.

2640
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,890
And that was the great hope that if people traded

2641
01:51:58,890 --> 01:52:00,900
with each other, they wouldn't fight.

2642
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:02,790
He was also, you know,

2643
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:05,850
a proponent of the free movement of capital.

2644
01:52:05,850 --> 01:52:08,970
You know, he would absolutely oppose this idea that,

2645
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:10,980
you know, Nippon Steel wasn't allowed to invest

2646
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:12,033
in the United States.

2647
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:15,390
I think he would struggle,

2648
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:18,660
and he wholeheartedly embraced Reagan,

2649
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:20,580
and he worked to minimize the parts

2650
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:22,860
of the Reagan legacy he didn't like.

2651
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:25,530
I think he would find it harder to embrace Trump,

2652
01:52:25,530 --> 01:52:28,440
because he's not of that style.

2653
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:29,880
He just had a different style.

2654
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:33,033
But I'm guessing he would have come around through,

2655
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:36,180
I think he would just say, "Okay,

2656
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:38,250
we have a chance to reduce the size of government."

2657
01:52:38,250 --> 01:52:41,790
At the same time, the spending plans

2658
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:43,530
of the Trump administration

2659
01:52:43,530 --> 01:52:46,170
are not fiscally conservative in any way.

2660
01:52:46,170 --> 01:52:48,090
And that was his concern,

2661
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:49,620
was not so much with debt,

2662
01:52:49,620 --> 01:52:52,920
but with the feeling that there's no mechanism

2663
01:52:52,920 --> 01:52:54,600
to stop the growth of government,

2664
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:56,730
that it just grows and grows and grows.

2665
01:52:56,730 --> 01:52:58,860
And so he ended up believing,

2666
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:01,185
like even deficits aren't so bad,

2667
01:53:01,185 --> 01:53:04,050
because they make politicians cautious,

2668
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:06,393
he thought, about continuing to spend,

2669
01:53:07,230 --> 01:53:09,810
but I have to believe he would be concerned

2670
01:53:09,810 --> 01:53:14,810
about the potential threats to the US currency's position

2671
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:17,190
as the world's reserve currency

2672
01:53:17,190 --> 01:53:19,773
with increased levels of debt and spending.

2673
01:53:21,690 --> 01:53:26,070
He was concerned about low interest rates in the,

2674
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:30,690
he died, I think it's 2004, 2006,

2675
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:32,130
but it was in the beginning,

2676
01:53:32,130 --> 01:53:33,450
he didn't see the zero low bound,

2677
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:34,560
but he saw low interest rates.

2678
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,690
And he said, "This isn't necessarily good."

2679
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:37,523
Everyone's talking

2680
01:53:37,523 --> 01:53:39,900
about low interest rates as if they're good,

2681
01:53:39,900 --> 01:53:42,630
but there should be a price on capital,

2682
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:44,310
there should be a price on this.

2683
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:45,600
It shouldn't be so low.

2684
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:50,600
And so he had some of still the kind of macro insights

2685
01:53:51,090 --> 01:53:52,380
that I think are important.

2686
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:55,687
- You wrote "The Wall Street Journal" essay titled

2687
01:53:55,687 --> 01:54:00,110
"How Inflation Ended Neoliberalism and Re-Elected Trump."

2688
01:54:00,110 --> 01:54:02,820
So can we weave that into this discussion

2689
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:07,530
in terms of inflation and Trump,

2690
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:09,210
what's the main idea of the essay?

2691
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:12,360
- So the main idea is kind of looking back and saying,

2692
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:15,750
so today we have been living

2693
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:19,080
in a world where people have been focused

2694
01:54:19,080 --> 01:54:24,080
on monetary policy, steady monetary policy,

2695
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:27,090
free trade, reducing regulation.

2696
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:29,970
This is all called the neoliberal era.

2697
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:33,870
And my argument was a lot of that arose,

2698
01:54:33,870 --> 01:54:35,490
was driven by inflation.

2699
01:54:35,490 --> 01:54:39,420
So we have Milton Friedman predict inflation in 1967.

2700
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,760
It starts breaking out in the 1970s,

2701
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,560
Britain and the United States,

2702
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:48,560
and every institution was designed around stable prices.

2703
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:52,110
And once inflation broke out,

2704
01:54:52,110 --> 01:54:53,700
prices were no longer stable.

2705
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:58,170
So, for example, tax rates weren't inflation adjusted.

2706
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:02,070
So if your income went up because of inflation,

2707
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:03,660
you might bump from a low tax rate

2708
01:55:03,660 --> 01:55:05,130
to an extremely high tax rate,

2709
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:06,810
but you don't actually have more money.

2710
01:55:06,810 --> 01:55:08,100
On paper, you have more money,

2711
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,240
but everything costs more,

2712
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:10,077
so you don't actually have more money

2713
01:55:10,077 --> 01:55:12,030
and your taxes have gone up.

2714
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:14,490
That kicks off the taxpayer revolt.

2715
01:55:14,490 --> 01:55:16,140
There's a whole shift

2716
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:18,540
of American corporations towards focusing

2717
01:55:18,540 --> 01:55:20,250
on financial investments,

2718
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:24,480
because the tax breaks they used to get for depreciation,

2719
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,090
for building new factories, are not inflation adjusted.

2720
01:55:27,090 --> 01:55:30,390
So they no longer pay off in an inflationary environment.

2721
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:32,970
And then when Paul Volcker comes in

2722
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:36,210
in 1980s, early 1980s,

2723
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:37,950
and starts fighting inflation,

2724
01:55:37,950 --> 01:55:41,190
really pushes up interest rates to bring down inflation.

2725
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:44,190
And that completely reorders the banking sector,

2726
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:48,510
because banks had statutory legal limits

2727
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:49,950
on the interest they could charge.

2728
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:54,240
And once general market interest rates exceeded that,

2729
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:56,640
this proliferation of new financial forms

2730
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:58,050
to take advantage of that.

2731
01:55:58,050 --> 01:55:59,580
So my point was,

2732
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:03,723
the era we live in was ushered in by inflation.

2733
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:08,760
And then everyone turned against all the formulations we had

2734
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,260
and said, "Well,

2735
01:56:10,260 --> 01:56:12,543
these have hollowed out our industrial base.

2736
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:16,680
We've got too much immigration.

2737
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:18,811
We've got too much economic openness.

2738
01:56:18,811 --> 01:56:19,644
We need to reshore.

2739
01:56:19,644 --> 01:56:20,640
We need to focus.

2740
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:21,930
We need to turn against all these things.

2741
01:56:21,930 --> 01:56:23,460
We need to spend more.

2742
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:25,230
We've disinvested."

2743
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:30,210
And the net result of that turning away, I argued,

2744
01:56:30,210 --> 01:56:32,250
is people forgot about inflation.

2745
01:56:32,250 --> 01:56:34,110
They really forgot it could ever exist.

2746
01:56:34,110 --> 01:56:36,000
And you had a whole set of theories on the left,

2747
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,747
modern monetary theory, that basically said,

2748
01:56:37,747 --> 01:56:39,560
"We don't really need to worry about inflation,

2749
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,700
we can spend what we want."

2750
01:56:41,700 --> 01:56:44,460
And lo and behold, inflation came back.

2751
01:56:44,460 --> 01:56:48,540
And so my argument is that has now opened the door

2752
01:56:48,540 --> 01:56:50,190
to the presidency of Donald Trump,

2753
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:55,020
which is potentially a deeply transformative moment

2754
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:58,830
that will change the size and shape of government,

2755
01:56:58,830 --> 01:57:01,290
that may change our foreign policy profoundly,

2756
01:57:01,290 --> 01:57:05,160
that may change our immigration policy, I mean,

2757
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,647
change the demographics of our country, all of that.

2758
01:57:07,647 --> 01:57:08,700
And my thesis

2759
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:12,570
is that has all been made possible by inflation.

2760
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:16,283
And so the great mistake of the past years

2761
01:57:16,283 --> 01:57:20,490
was to forget how fundamental inflation was to the rise

2762
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:22,290
of the last political order

2763
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:27,290
and to profoundly underestimate how much inflation

2764
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:30,090
would change the current political order.

2765
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:32,610
So I just think it's one of these things.

2766
01:57:32,610 --> 01:57:34,200
This is why I think you should study history,

2767
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:35,580
because I think if you had studied history,

2768
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:37,140
you would be aware of this.

2769
01:57:37,140 --> 01:57:40,380
And it's so easy for people to forget,

2770
01:57:40,380 --> 01:57:42,000
just like the banks forgot

2771
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,620
that interest rates could ever go up.

2772
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:44,730
They got so used to it,

2773
01:57:44,730 --> 01:57:47,340
and it's only a 10, 15-year thing,

2774
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,840
but to them that seems like forever.

2775
01:57:48,840 --> 01:57:52,380
So I really do believe what history teaches you to do

2776
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:57,000
is just have a much vaster scope in your vision

2777
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,460
and then take into account the possibilities

2778
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:01,530
of so many things happening that are different

2779
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:02,760
than what's happening today.

2780
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:06,600
And so I just hope we don't forget about inflation entirely.

2781
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,840
But here's the thing, it is quite a strong chance

2782
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,860
that Trump's policies will initiate even worse inflation,

2783
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:17,280
and then they will prove to be his undoing.

2784
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:20,013
So the ironies of inflation could be continuing.

2785
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:24,810
- Like you said, Milton Friedman would be a big fan of Doge,

2786
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:27,420
so if he was still here today

2787
01:58:27,420 --> 01:58:30,060
and rolled with Elon Musk and Vivek,

2788
01:58:30,060 --> 01:58:31,620
what advice would he give?

2789
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:34,140
What do you think he would focus on

2790
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:36,600
in terms of where to cut, how to cut,

2791
01:58:36,600 --> 01:58:38,073
how to think about cutting?

2792
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:41,070
- You know, his signature policy move,

2793
01:58:41,070 --> 01:58:41,903
I talk about this,

2794
01:58:41,903 --> 01:58:45,360
is taking the price mechanism

2795
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:49,170
and trying to make that into the policy.

2796
01:58:49,170 --> 01:58:52,590
And that seems sort of obvious to us today.

2797
01:58:52,590 --> 01:58:54,420
But in the era that he came in,

2798
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:57,120
so there would be rent controls.

2799
01:58:57,120 --> 01:58:58,350
Let's take away rent controls,

2800
01:58:58,350 --> 01:59:00,540
let's let housing prices set themselves.

2801
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:03,570
Or, he was very against national parks.

2802
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:05,400
I actually think the national parks are good,

2803
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,761
so I hope the Doge people don't take this up, but,

2804
01:59:07,761 --> 01:59:08,910
(Lex and Jennifer laugh)

2805
01:59:08,910 --> 01:59:11,700
that rather than an allocation to fund the national parks,

2806
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:12,630
they should be funded

2807
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:15,630
by the revenue that they bring in when people visit them.

2808
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:17,970
And so I think he was always looking

2809
01:59:17,970 --> 01:59:20,520
to let's let prices make the decisions here.

2810
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:23,580
So I think that would be one of the key pieces.

2811
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:26,100
The other thing I think he'd really be thinking about,

2812
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:30,150
he wrote about this a lot about occupational licensure

2813
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:31,680
and barriers to entry.

2814
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:32,640
And he felt like one

2815
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,010
of the worst things that government does,

2816
01:59:35,010 --> 01:59:37,380
and sometimes it's private entities that do this,

2817
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:38,520
is create barriers

2818
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,430
to entry to protect industries and markets.

2819
01:59:41,430 --> 01:59:43,050
So he talked about this

2820
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:44,430
in the case of the medical profession,

2821
01:59:44,430 --> 01:59:46,650
which I think is actually not a good example,

2822
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:49,650
because I think we all have a collective investment

2823
01:59:49,650 --> 01:59:52,410
in having medical doctors be highly trained.

2824
01:59:52,410 --> 01:59:53,310
But so, for instance,

2825
01:59:53,310 --> 01:59:57,360
you could look at nail technicians or haircutting.

2826
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,190
There's often these licensing requirements

2827
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:00,660
or there's a sort of big kerfuffle.

2828
02:00:00,660 --> 02:00:02,850
I think it's D.C. passed a law

2829
02:00:02,850 --> 02:00:04,170
that to run a childcare center,

2830
02:00:04,170 --> 02:00:05,280
you have to have a college degree.

2831
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:06,113
Well, what does that do?

2832
02:00:06,113 --> 02:00:07,920
I mean, that disenfranchises a whole bunch

2833
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:08,910
of would-be entrepreneurs

2834
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:10,260
who don't happen to have a college degree,

2835
02:00:10,260 --> 02:00:11,340
but probably could be really good

2836
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:12,960
at this particular business.

2837
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:14,643
So I think he would be saying,

2838
02:00:15,877 --> 02:00:19,410
"Look out for where private interests have used the state

2839
02:00:19,410 --> 02:00:21,180
to protect themselves,

2840
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:24,630
and clear away those types of barriers

2841
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:29,630
and let competition through prices guide outcomes."

2842
02:00:30,210 --> 02:00:32,250
- Yeah, so open up for more competition

2843
02:00:32,250 --> 02:00:35,340
and allow for more signals

2844
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:38,010
from the market to drive decisions and so on.

2845
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:38,970
- Yes, yeah.

2846
02:00:38,970 --> 02:00:43,970
- Which would actually naturally lead to cutting a lot

2847
02:00:44,100 --> 02:00:46,260
of the bureaucracy of government.

2848
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:49,890
- I think the other thing he would probably be arguing for

2849
02:00:49,890 --> 02:00:51,210
is, again, going back to the design

2850
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:54,420
of the minimum income or the negative income tax,

2851
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:56,130
that there's a way,

2852
02:00:56,130 --> 02:00:58,320
he ultimately decided to run it

2853
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,340
through the tax system.

2854
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:01,740
The government's already collecting this data.

2855
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:03,120
They already have your information,

2856
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:05,880
and they can just send the money out through the system,

2857
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:07,980
rather than having a social bureaucracy

2858
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,480
where you have to come in in person,

2859
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:11,190
you have to fill out forms,

2860
02:01:11,190 --> 02:01:12,510
you have to document,

2861
02:01:12,510 --> 02:01:14,820
do you own a car, what's your income,

2862
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:16,710
who lives in the household.

2863
02:01:16,710 --> 02:01:17,790
So I think he would say,

2864
02:01:17,790 --> 02:01:19,557
and his analysis of that was,

2865
02:01:19,557 --> 02:01:24,557
who that really benefited was the bureaucracy

2866
02:01:24,990 --> 02:01:26,523
that processed that paper,

2867
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:29,340
that implemented those norms.

2868
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:31,470
And then if you could pull that away,

2869
02:01:31,470 --> 02:01:34,590
you could get help out where it was needed much quicker

2870
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:37,140
without having this drag of people doing

2871
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:39,810
sort of unproductive work of administering these systems.

2872
02:01:39,810 --> 02:01:41,670
So I think trying to cut administrative overhead.

2873
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:44,490
And what he didn't have then, which we have now,

2874
02:01:44,490 --> 02:01:46,440
is the technology that we have

2875
02:01:46,440 --> 02:01:50,040
and the ability to send benefits out via smartphone

2876
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:53,610
or just to move so much faster

2877
02:01:53,610 --> 02:01:58,140
and to handle information on a mass scale so much faster.

2878
02:01:58,140 --> 02:01:59,040
- It's painful,

2879
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:01,650
but I think one of the big things you can do is just that,

2880
02:02:01,650 --> 02:02:05,490
which is digitalize, I don't know if that's a word,

2881
02:02:05,490 --> 02:02:10,110
but just convert everything to where the speed

2882
02:02:10,110 --> 02:02:13,500
of signal can be instantaneous,

2883
02:02:13,500 --> 02:02:17,430
so there's no paperwork.

2884
02:02:17,430 --> 02:02:18,450
It goes immediately.

2885
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:22,500
And then that means that the pricing signals

2886
02:02:22,500 --> 02:02:24,117
and all these kinds of things

2887
02:02:24,117 --> 02:02:26,580
are just immediately available to people.

2888
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:28,170
- That seems to be the low-hanging fruit.

2889
02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:29,430
Government, you know,

2890
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:33,300
IT systems could be vastly improved upon.

2891
02:02:33,300 --> 02:02:35,070
- But that would result again with a lot

2892
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:37,263
of people getting fired.

2893
02:02:38,310 --> 02:02:40,710
And I think somebody submitted a question

2894
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:42,273
for me saying like,

2895
02:02:44,317 --> 02:02:45,270
"What are your thoughts,

2896
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,860
as a person who cares about compassion,

2897
02:02:46,860 --> 02:02:49,290
what are your thoughts about government employees,

2898
02:02:49,290 --> 02:02:51,240
which there's a lot of,

2899
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:55,830
that are going to be hurt by Doge?

2900
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:59,430
And it's always a really difficult question.

2901
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:03,720
A lot of people get fired to make room for a new system.

2902
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:05,760
That's going to lead to a lot of pain.

2903
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,620
- There is going to be a lot of pain.

2904
02:03:07,620 --> 02:03:09,750
I don't know what the solution is.

2905
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:11,580
I think that's also part

2906
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:15,120
of why Friedman favored a minimum income.

2907
02:03:15,120 --> 02:03:17,310
He talked about it being sort of countercyclical.

2908
02:03:17,310 --> 02:03:21,780
In other words, when things were really bad,

2909
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:23,820
the spending level on it would naturally go up.

2910
02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:26,770
This is what economists today call an automatic stabilizer.

2911
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:29,910
And then when it's not needed,

2912
02:03:29,910 --> 02:03:31,293
the cost of it goes down.

2913
02:03:33,150 --> 02:03:35,730
I mean, maybe there's a way to make it sweeten it with honey

2914
02:03:35,730 --> 02:03:37,680
and have people take buyouts or things like that.

2915
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:41,130
That would certainly be a way better way to go.

2916
02:03:41,130 --> 02:03:43,380
- I did a podcast with Javier Milei.

2917
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:46,020
He has consistently praised Milton Friedman

2918
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:48,000
and cited him as one of his inspirations,

2919
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,140
so what do you think Milton Friedman would say

2920
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:54,300
about what's going on in Argentina

2921
02:03:54,300 --> 02:03:56,880
and what Javier Milei is trying to do in Argentina?

2922
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:58,380
- Yeah, I think he would appreciate it.

2923
02:03:58,380 --> 02:04:00,600
I mean, I think Milei is much more

2924
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,540
of an Austrian-inspired thinker,

2925
02:04:03,540 --> 02:04:05,277
but I think he definitely appreciates Friedman.

2926
02:04:05,277 --> 02:04:07,290
And on the macro level,

2927
02:04:07,290 --> 02:04:10,560
Friedman always understood it's really painful

2928
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:14,520
to treat inflation, but the more you put it off,

2929
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:15,900
the harder it is.

2930
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:20,220
So I think he would be trying to get him, as he's doing,

2931
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:25,220
to just message that short-term pain, long-term gain.

2932
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:27,030
I think he'd be very supportive.

2933
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:30,360
I think he'd be thrilled to see also that Milei is very good

2934
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,010
at explaining these abstract ideas

2935
02:04:32,010 --> 02:04:33,360
and putting his policies

2936
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,310
in a framework of the bigger picture.

2937
02:04:35,310 --> 02:04:37,860
That was really meaningful to Friedman.

2938
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:41,343
I don't know how politically persuasive it is overall.

2939
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:44,340
You know, Milei is very intense.

2940
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:48,630
He doesn't have the same sort of gifts of salesmanship

2941
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:49,680
and setting people at ease

2942
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:51,240
that say someone like Ronald Reagan had,

2943
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:52,073
but it seems to be

2944
02:04:52,073 --> 02:04:54,834
that's what his country was calling for right now, so.

2945
02:04:54,834 --> 02:04:59,580
- Yeah, he is more chainsaw, less like warm blanket.

2946
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:00,413
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

2947
02:05:00,413 --> 02:05:02,610
(Lex chuckles)

2948
02:05:02,610 --> 02:05:05,588
Javier recollects this line from Milton Friedman.

2949
02:05:05,588 --> 02:05:07,027
I don't know if this is accurate, but,

2950
02:05:07,027 --> 02:05:09,390
"If you strive for equality over freedom,

2951
02:05:09,390 --> 02:05:10,740
you often get neither,

2952
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:13,470
but if you strive for freedom, you often get both."

2953
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:15,630
Do you think there's truth to this?

2954
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:18,780
- You know, I think on the big picture, definitely.

2955
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:23,780
I mean we've seen focusing too much on equality can be,

2956
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:28,560
because equality is such an alluring word,

2957
02:05:28,560 --> 02:05:30,420
it can lead you to downgrade all kinds

2958
02:05:30,420 --> 02:05:32,520
of other things that are really important.

2959
02:05:32,520 --> 02:05:34,470
But I really think it depends

2960
02:05:34,470 --> 02:05:35,610
on how you're defining freedom.

2961
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:39,420
I mean the statement is too big and too broad, right?

2962
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:44,420
So if you're talking about freedom,

2963
02:05:45,030 --> 02:05:48,810
if by freedom you mean not having

2964
02:05:48,810 --> 02:05:51,630
to pay taxes if you're successful,

2965
02:05:51,630 --> 02:05:54,780
I think that can have all kinds of knock on effects.

2966
02:05:54,780 --> 02:05:57,270
The idea that people are able

2967
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:59,340
to prosper when they're educated,

2968
02:05:59,340 --> 02:06:02,010
where is education going to come from?

2969
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:04,290
How is that going to be paid for and supported?

2970
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:07,080
And again to go back to Knight,

2971
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:10,290
if you're generating too much inequality

2972
02:06:10,290 --> 02:06:11,400
or people are feeling

2973
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:13,563
that you're generating too much inequality,

2974
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:16,710
sometimes they value that more than they value freedom.

2975
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:19,020
And so I think the balance,

2976
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:22,050
I think there has to be more of a balance.

2977
02:06:22,050 --> 02:06:25,020
And it's hard to make such global statements.

2978
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:27,660
You have to break them down into what actually do you mean.

2979
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:31,890
But again, Milei is coming from a very different context,

2980
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:35,730
a very different country that has seen so much upheaval,

2981
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:38,130
so much government intervention, so much inflation,

2982
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:39,843
so much political turmoil.

2983
02:06:41,490 --> 02:06:42,480
He's probably thinking

2984
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,700
about it differently than Friedman was thinking about it.

2985
02:06:44,700 --> 02:06:46,330
- Yeah, I mean, there was,

2986
02:06:46,330 --> 02:06:49,890
there probably still is a real threat of hyperinflation.

2987
02:06:49,890 --> 02:06:52,740
There seems to be a very high level of corruption

2988
02:06:52,740 --> 02:06:54,150
or the capacity for corruption,

2989
02:06:54,150 --> 02:06:57,090
so it's a really messy situation.

2990
02:06:57,090 --> 02:07:01,380
So Javier Milei likes to recollect this great line

2991
02:07:01,380 --> 02:07:02,760
from Milton Friedman,

2992
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:05,250
that if you strive for equality over freedom,

2993
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,810
you often get neither,

2994
02:07:06,810 --> 02:07:09,543
but if you strive for freedom, you often get both.

2995
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:12,633
Do you think there's truth to this?

2996
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:15,750
- Yeah, I think in the macro, for sure.

2997
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:19,620
I mean, we've seen if you really put equality as your goal,

2998
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:22,830
it's such a seductive ideal

2999
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:24,360
and people believe in it so much

3000
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:27,780
that they can carry out horrible crimes

3001
02:07:27,780 --> 02:07:29,370
in the name of equality.

3002
02:07:29,370 --> 02:07:31,260
But then focusing on freedom,

3003
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:33,180
these words are too big.

3004
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:35,100
They're so hard to define.

3005
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:36,540
And so I think you have to ask sort of like,

3006
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,400
what is the freedom you're talking about?

3007
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:39,233
If you're talking

3008
02:07:39,233 --> 02:07:43,143
about the freedom of ordinary people to be entrepreneurial,

3009
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:46,350
to make their own way, to start new things,

3010
02:07:46,350 --> 02:07:47,460
to continue what they're doing,

3011
02:07:47,460 --> 02:07:48,450
to keep what they've earned,

3012
02:07:48,450 --> 02:07:52,290
for sure, I think that can increase the equality overall.

3013
02:07:52,290 --> 02:07:55,680
If you're talking about lower taxes,

3014
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:58,200
if freedom is just a code for lower taxes,

3015
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:59,670
there has to be,

3016
02:07:59,670 --> 02:08:01,920
I mean, lower taxes in general, great.

3017
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:05,820
But if you're one of the top generators of wealth,

3018
02:08:05,820 --> 02:08:10,820
there has to be some way to ensure that, say, education.

3019
02:08:11,010 --> 02:08:13,290
People prosper when they're well educated.

3020
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:14,670
That's when economies do better.

3021
02:08:14,670 --> 02:08:16,980
Education is generally state funded,

3022
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:18,960
and you need some way to support that

3023
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,890
and provide for those institutions that structure society,

3024
02:08:22,890 --> 02:08:25,170
that make competition possible.

3025
02:08:25,170 --> 02:08:28,950
So I think it's just a really broad statement.

3026
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:32,550
Again, Milei is coming from a really different context.

3027
02:08:32,550 --> 02:08:35,070
He's coming from the South American context,

3028
02:08:35,070 --> 02:08:38,370
from such upheaval, such economic devastation

3029
02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:42,090
in pursuit of the goal of equality that I think trying

3030
02:08:42,090 --> 02:08:44,130
to rebalance with that emphasis on freedom,

3031
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:46,530
I definitely see where he's coming from.

3032
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:48,000
- If we can pivot a little bit.

3033
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,980
We've talked about Reagan.

3034
02:08:49,980 --> 02:08:51,510
What are some interesting stories

3035
02:08:51,510 --> 02:08:54,240
about how Milton Friedman navigated the Reagan

3036
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,700
and maybe even the Nixon administrations

3037
02:08:56,700 --> 02:09:00,540
and how he was able to gain influence?

3038
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:02,220
- Well, the Nixon administration

3039
02:09:02,220 --> 02:09:03,840
is an interesting case, because,

3040
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:06,210
so I've been talking about inflation

3041
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:09,420
and the different consequences it had.

3042
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:11,610
One consequence it had is that it began

3043
02:09:11,610 --> 02:09:14,040
to undermine the Bretton Woods currency system

3044
02:09:14,040 --> 02:09:16,350
that was established in the wake of World War II.

3045
02:09:16,350 --> 02:09:18,660
Now, Bretton Woods, what it did,

3046
02:09:18,660 --> 02:09:23,070
basically it ended up inadvertently putting the US dollar

3047
02:09:23,070 --> 02:09:24,930
at the center of the world economic system.

3048
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:27,060
But under Bretton woods,

3049
02:09:27,060 --> 02:09:29,190
countries of the industrialized West agreed

3050
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:32,730
to trade their currency in set ratios that government set.

3051
02:09:32,730 --> 02:09:36,330
So a franc was worth so many dollars,

3052
02:09:36,330 --> 02:09:38,370
or a German mark was worth so many francs.

3053
02:09:38,370 --> 02:09:40,770
And then also under this system,

3054
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:42,540
countries could come to the United States

3055
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:47,540
and they could trade the dollars that they held for gold,

3056
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:50,790
because the US was on a sort of modified gold standard.

3057
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:54,810
There was a ratio of gold to paper money.

3058
02:09:54,810 --> 02:09:57,360
And so this system was set up

3059
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:01,530
and very quickly most countries were,

3060
02:10:01,530 --> 02:10:03,210
the dollar was at the heart of it

3061
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:04,920
in that the converting into

3062
02:10:04,920 --> 02:10:07,440
and out of dollars was really the mechanism of trade

3063
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,520
for many of these countries.

3064
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:11,550
So Friedman said, you know,

3065
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:15,300
what we should have is floating exchange rates.

3066
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:17,460
This is an idea, again,

3067
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:21,690
of instead of having a top-down design of policy,

3068
02:10:21,690 --> 02:10:25,260
an administered policy, we will have policy set by prices.

3069
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:27,210
And you should be able to trade currencies

3070
02:10:27,210 --> 02:10:28,170
on an open market.

3071
02:10:28,170 --> 02:10:29,700
They should trade and they should fluctuate,

3072
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,260
and that would be fine.

3073
02:10:31,260 --> 02:10:32,913
Totally outlandish idea.

3074
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:35,730
But he was pinpointing the fact

3075
02:10:35,730 --> 02:10:38,400
that Bretton Woods had an instability.

3076
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:40,320
And that instability began to emerge

3077
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,060
in the time of inflation.

3078
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:46,530
So you have more and more dollars being printed.

3079
02:10:46,530 --> 02:10:49,050
They're worth less and less.

3080
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:54,050
If European nations keep trading their currency for dollars,

3081
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,340
they're going to be importing inflation

3082
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:57,630
into their own economies.

3083
02:10:57,630 --> 02:11:00,570
So they say, "We don't want these dollars.

3084
02:11:00,570 --> 02:11:02,280
We'd like some gold instead."

3085
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:04,380
And they have the right to go to the Treasury,

3086
02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:07,500
send in an order, and get gold out.

3087
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:10,560
And so they start doing this more and more,

3088
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,290
and it becomes, it's called the gold drain.

3089
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:16,890
And the United States starts running out of gold.

3090
02:11:16,890 --> 02:11:19,020
They're aware this is happening through the 60s.

3091
02:11:19,020 --> 02:11:21,840
They're trying various things to fix it.

3092
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,907
And when Nixon comes into office in '68,

3093
02:11:28,050 --> 02:11:30,663
Friedman sends him a memo and it says,

3094
02:11:33,007 --> 02:11:35,070
"This is going to be a real problem."

3095
02:11:35,070 --> 02:11:36,303
He says something like,

3096
02:11:37,657 --> 02:11:39,870
"This is a running sore,

3097
02:11:39,870 --> 02:11:41,820
and you have to lance it right away."

3098
02:11:41,820 --> 02:11:43,571
You know, some very graphic metaphor.

3099
02:11:43,571 --> 02:11:45,126
- [Lex] Very nice.

3100
02:11:45,126 --> 02:11:46,170
- Otherwise it's going to, you know,

3101
02:11:46,170 --> 02:11:47,700
it's going to explode.

3102
02:11:47,700 --> 02:11:50,850
And Nixon just, you know, files the memo away.

3103
02:11:50,850 --> 02:11:54,780
Nixon loved people to think he was influenced by

3104
02:11:54,780 --> 02:11:57,480
and following the wisdom of Milton Friedman.

3105
02:11:57,480 --> 02:11:59,880
But he didn't actually want to do that.

3106
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,640
He just wanted the political benefit that came from it.

3107
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:06,840
So then comes the moment

3108
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:09,810
where the US Treasury Department realizes,

3109
02:12:09,810 --> 02:12:12,300
we are going to run out of gold.

3110
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:13,133
What should we do?

3111
02:12:13,133 --> 02:12:17,433
And everybody decamps to Camp David, and Nixon decides,

3112
02:12:18,300 --> 02:12:22,140
we're just going to stop redeeming currency for gold.

3113
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:24,390
It's called slamming the gold window shut.

3114
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:25,470
Done.

3115
02:12:25,470 --> 02:12:28,260
And he also, at that same meeting,

3116
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:31,080
decides to institute price controls.

3117
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:32,310
He does a whole bunch of stuff.

3118
02:12:32,310 --> 02:12:33,420
It's an emergency.

3119
02:12:33,420 --> 02:12:35,190
He calls it the New Economic Plan,

3120
02:12:35,190 --> 02:12:36,720
which is an unconscious echo

3121
02:12:36,720 --> 02:12:38,520
of the Soviet New Economic Plan,

3122
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:42,420
so a problematic name, a problematic policy.

3123
02:12:42,420 --> 02:12:45,757
And Friedman is livid at the price controls, but he's like,

3124
02:12:45,757 --> 02:12:48,690
"Actually, it's great that you close the gold window.

3125
02:12:48,690 --> 02:12:51,210
Let's go all the way to floating exchange rates."

3126
02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:54,720
And this idea was heresy within the Treasury Department.

3127
02:12:54,720 --> 02:12:58,080
Everyone's very committed to the idea

3128
02:12:58,080 --> 02:13:01,440
of the gold standard convertibility possibility,

3129
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:04,260
the United States at the core of the financial system,

3130
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:05,550
kind of hem and ha.

3131
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:06,383
But at this point,

3132
02:13:06,383 --> 02:13:09,480
Friedman has a very close relationship with George Shultz.

3133
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:12,870
And George Shultz is a high-level appointee

3134
02:13:12,870 --> 02:13:14,430
who will eventually,

3135
02:13:14,430 --> 02:13:15,990
over the course of Nixon administrations,

3136
02:13:15,990 --> 02:13:17,460
become the Treasury Secretary.

3137
02:13:17,460 --> 02:13:22,050
And so Friedman is feeding Schultz all his ideas

3138
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:24,840
about how we should move to floating exchange rates,

3139
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:27,750
how we shouldn't try to reconstruct Bretton Woods.

3140
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:29,313
And the people in Treasury,

3141
02:13:30,330 --> 02:13:31,800
it's funny because I've read some of their accounts

3142
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:33,960
and actually Paul Volcker is in the Treasury Department

3143
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:35,700
at this time, and he can kind of sense

3144
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:38,070
that Friedman is in here somewhere,

3145
02:13:38,070 --> 02:13:40,440
like feeding his boss ideas.

3146
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:41,670
He doesn't quite know.

3147
02:13:41,670 --> 02:13:43,800
And in the oral history,

3148
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:45,840
Schulz talks about this quite a bit.

3149
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,680
So at any rate,

3150
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:49,470
Friedman exerts this behind-the-scenes influence.

3151
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:51,090
And what Schultz does is just

3152
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:54,150
kind of lets Bretton Woods fade away.

3153
02:13:54,150 --> 02:13:56,130
He doesn't make grand pronouncements.

3154
02:13:56,130 --> 02:14:01,130
It just slowly the world shifts to a regime of,

3155
02:14:03,690 --> 02:14:05,823
for a while it was like a regime of steady prices.

3156
02:14:05,823 --> 02:14:08,310
Then they call it a steady regime of changing prices,

3157
02:14:08,310 --> 02:14:09,660
or whatever, the language changes,

3158
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:11,100
the reality changes,

3159
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:12,630
and they kind of end up where they are.

3160
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:15,840
So that's a real measure of Friedman's influence.

3161
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:17,400
If there had been another economist

3162
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,637
in Schultz's ear that said,

3163
02:14:18,637 --> 02:14:20,850
"No, catastrophe is imminent,

3164
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:22,680
we have to go back to Bretton Woods,"

3165
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:24,060
he probably would have worked harder.

3166
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:26,160
The US government would have worked harder.

3167
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:30,540
And so that becomes one of these pieces of globalization.

3168
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:33,660
And what people don't realize is there used to be,

3169
02:14:33,660 --> 02:14:36,270
in addition to these floating set capital ratios,

3170
02:14:36,270 --> 02:14:37,350
you couldn't bring capital in

3171
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:38,430
and out of different countries.

3172
02:14:38,430 --> 02:14:40,650
You had to register, you couldn't invest,

3173
02:14:40,650 --> 02:14:42,210
all these rules and strictures,

3174
02:14:42,210 --> 02:14:45,270
and the falling of Bretton Woods really blows that all open.

3175
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:47,070
It's a precursor to globalization.

3176
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:49,380
So Friedman is right there.

3177
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:52,500
Now, he's very ambivalent about Nixon.

3178
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:56,010
I mean, he sees that Nixon is not an honest person.

3179
02:14:56,010 --> 02:14:57,610
He thinks he's very intelligent.

3180
02:14:58,510 --> 02:15:02,970
And Nixon's dream is to create a new centrist majority.

3181
02:15:02,970 --> 02:15:05,100
So he does many things to go back

3182
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:08,700
on his supposed economic principles and ideals.

3183
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:09,870
So Friedman does not like this.

3184
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:11,790
He doesn't like the price controls.

3185
02:15:11,790 --> 02:15:14,970
He's in communication with his old mentor, Arthur Burns,

3186
02:15:14,970 --> 02:15:16,890
who's now the chair of the Federal Reserve.

3187
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:20,130
And Burns is basically doing everything wrong

3188
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:21,330
in monetary policy.

3189
02:15:21,330 --> 02:15:24,030
And I describe this in the book in some detail,

3190
02:15:24,030 --> 02:15:25,830
these anguished letters back and forth.

3191
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:28,860
And basically, as I see it,

3192
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:31,200
Burns doesn't have a solid theory of inflation.

3193
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:34,140
And the more Friedman pushes him,

3194
02:15:34,140 --> 02:15:36,915
it's almost like Burns is willfully ignoring Friedman

3195
02:15:36,915 --> 02:15:39,030
and kind of doing the opposite of what Friedman says.

3196
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:42,330
So Burns is running a very loose monetary policy.

3197
02:15:42,330 --> 02:15:44,490
Inflation is quite considerable over the 70s.

3198
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:46,500
I mean, we were all spooked by what, did it get to?

3199
02:15:46,500 --> 02:15:48,060
6%, something like that,

3200
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:50,400
recently, for a very short time.

3201
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:53,100
This is inflation going over 10%,

3202
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:56,040
hovering in 8% for basically the whole decade of the 70s,

3203
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:58,560
going up and down with extremely elevated rates.

3204
02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:02,850
And so the Carter presidency largely falls.

3205
02:16:02,850 --> 02:16:04,290
Foreign policy is a big part of it,

3206
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:06,240
but the failure to tame inflation is part of it.

3207
02:16:06,240 --> 02:16:10,170
And then Reagan comes in, and now Reagan loves Friedman,

3208
02:16:10,170 --> 02:16:11,340
and Friedman loves Reagan.

3209
02:16:11,340 --> 02:16:13,530
Very mutual feeling.

3210
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:14,760
The Reagan administration creates

3211
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:16,470
like an advisory economic board.

3212
02:16:16,470 --> 02:16:17,430
Friedman's on it.

3213
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:18,810
He's retired now.

3214
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:21,060
He's entering his kind of golden years.

3215
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:22,740
But he really has Reagan's ear.

3216
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:26,730
And here what he does is he convinces Reagan

3217
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:28,320
of his theory of inflation,

3218
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:30,840
which is inflation has been caused.

3219
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,969
It's a monetary phenomenon that has been caused

3220
02:16:32,969 --> 02:16:34,503
by bad monetary policy.

3221
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:38,700
Inflation has an accelerating dynamic.

3222
02:16:38,700 --> 02:16:43,559
The only way to end inflation is by really showing

3223
02:16:43,559 --> 02:16:46,080
and signaling that government policy has changed.

3224
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:49,080
And when you do that, it's very painful

3225
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:52,230
for a short amount of time, people will suffer,

3226
02:16:52,230 --> 02:16:54,480
but then you will come out on the other side

3227
02:16:54,480 --> 02:16:55,920
into stable prices,

3228
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:58,620
and this is what you need for economic prosperity.

3229
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:02,522
So the man who implements this policy, Paul Volcker,

3230
02:17:03,360 --> 02:17:05,760
is definitely influenced by Friedman,

3231
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:08,340
buys the big picture of Friedman.

3232
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:11,879
He even buys Friedman's specific technique

3233
02:17:11,879 --> 02:17:13,590
of the monetary growth rule

3234
02:17:13,590 --> 02:17:16,020
and of the focus on monetary aggregates,

3235
02:17:16,020 --> 02:17:17,940
which Friedman has said, right, "Money matters,

3236
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:20,700
aggregates matter, and that's what money is."

3237
02:17:20,700 --> 02:17:25,230
Pretty quickly, Volcker finds that because of inflation

3238
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:28,020
and the financial deregulation in response to it,

3239
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:31,410
the aggregates don't work the way Friedman said they would.

3240
02:17:31,410 --> 02:17:35,070
And so the specific policy Friedman recommends,

3241
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:36,389
Volcker tries it for a year or so,

3242
02:17:36,389 --> 02:17:38,309
doesn't work super well.

3243
02:17:38,309 --> 02:17:42,059
But what does work is letting interest rates go high,

3244
02:17:42,059 --> 02:17:43,559
go above inflation

3245
02:17:43,559 --> 02:17:46,860
to a point where both the general citizenry

3246
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:48,457
and the financial markets Believe, like,

3247
02:17:48,457 --> 02:17:50,670
"Oh, they're actually serious about inflation."

3248
02:17:50,670 --> 02:17:51,900
And because we've had a decade

3249
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:55,087
of inflation with all these presidents saying,

3250
02:17:55,087 --> 02:17:57,600
"Forward, we're going to whip inflation now,"

3251
02:17:57,600 --> 02:18:00,030
that monetary policy has lost credibility.

3252
02:18:00,030 --> 02:18:02,639
This is why people focus so much on credibility today,

3253
02:18:02,639 --> 02:18:05,156
because once it's lost, it's really hard to get it back.

3254
02:18:05,156 --> 02:18:09,420
And one way Volcker gets it back is interest rates over 20%,

3255
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:11,160
unemployment very high,

3256
02:18:11,160 --> 02:18:15,000
as high as 25% in construction sectors.

3257
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,950
And as this is happening,

3258
02:18:16,950 --> 02:18:19,297
Milton Friedman is whispering in Reagan's ear,

3259
02:18:19,297 --> 02:18:21,059
"This is the right thing.

3260
02:18:21,059 --> 02:18:21,930
Stay the course.

3261
02:18:21,930 --> 02:18:23,610
This is going to work."

3262
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:27,510
Now, interestingly, he hates Volcker, Volcker hates him.

3263
02:18:27,510 --> 02:18:30,059
And Friedman will never give Volcker credit for this policy,

3264
02:18:30,059 --> 02:18:32,580
but he will give Reagan credit for this policy.

3265
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:35,100
But he owes credit himself

3266
02:18:35,100 --> 02:18:39,840
for keeping Reagan from wobbling on this policy

3267
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:41,520
and just pushing it through.

3268
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:43,807
And he also tells Reagan very pragmatically,

3269
02:18:43,807 --> 02:18:45,660
"You better do this now.

3270
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:47,040
You've got a four-year term.

3271
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,379
Do this in the first two years of your term.

3272
02:18:49,379 --> 02:18:51,629
Things will have turned around by 1984

3273
02:18:51,629 --> 02:18:52,920
when you run for reelection,

3274
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:53,850
and you'll benefit from it."

3275
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:55,920
And that's absolutely what happens.

3276
02:18:55,920 --> 02:18:57,870
- If we could take a small tangent,

3277
02:18:57,870 --> 02:19:01,410
sort of a question I have to ask about, (chuckles)

3278
02:19:01,410 --> 02:19:02,580
since we mentioned Bretton Woods

3279
02:19:02,580 --> 02:19:03,809
and maybe the gold standard,

3280
02:19:03,809 --> 02:19:05,850
maybe just have a general discussion

3281
02:19:05,850 --> 02:19:08,160
about this whole space of ideas.

3282
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:09,600
There's a lot of people today

3283
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:11,150
that care about cryptocurrency.

3284
02:19:12,629 --> 02:19:15,660
What do you think that Milton Friedman would say

3285
02:19:15,660 --> 02:19:17,700
about cryptocurrency

3286
02:19:17,700 --> 02:19:22,700
and what role crypto might play in the economy?

3287
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:28,760
Whether he would be for this idea, against this idea,

3288
02:19:28,980 --> 02:19:31,469
and if we could look at it for today,

3289
02:19:31,469 --> 02:19:34,650
and also just 10, 100 years from now.

3290
02:19:34,650 --> 02:19:35,910
- There's a clip,

3291
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:37,957
I think it's in 1992, where people say,

3292
02:19:37,957 --> 02:19:40,170
"Oh, Friedman predicted cryptocurrencies,"

3293
02:19:40,170 --> 02:19:41,190
because he's talking (Lex chuckles)

3294
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:45,270
about how payments will eventually be electronic.

3295
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:47,820
So in some ways he definitely,

3296
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:49,050
as he was looking at the computer and money,

3297
02:19:49,050 --> 02:19:51,780
he knew these would come together in some way.

3298
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:56,490
I think he probably would see a use case for crypto.

3299
02:19:56,490 --> 02:20:00,000
He definitely would not buy the stronger forms, I think,

3300
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,520
of crypto ideology

3301
02:20:02,520 --> 02:20:05,370
in which we could be heading towards a future

3302
02:20:05,370 --> 02:20:07,410
in which there's many different currencies that compete

3303
02:20:07,410 --> 02:20:09,780
or that are distributed or there's a stateless currency.

3304
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:12,090
And he addresses this very, very clearly,

3305
02:20:12,090 --> 02:20:14,940
because Hayek's "Denationalization of Money,"

3306
02:20:14,940 --> 02:20:17,250
it's a paper in the late 70s, you know,

3307
02:20:17,250 --> 02:20:18,510
Hayek argues for this

3308
02:20:18,510 --> 02:20:21,180
kind of competing currency model or regime.

3309
02:20:21,180 --> 02:20:22,830
And so he's responding to that.

3310
02:20:22,830 --> 02:20:25,590
He's responding to people writing about free banking.

3311
02:20:25,590 --> 02:20:27,273
And he basically says, "Look,

3312
02:20:28,110 --> 02:20:31,170
even if you developed a variety of competing currencies,

3313
02:20:31,170 --> 02:20:33,900
eventually society would converge on one."

3314
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:36,390
And that's because people just want one currency.

3315
02:20:36,390 --> 02:20:39,210
They know they don't want a bunch of different options.

3316
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:41,850
Even in places where there have been options to do that,

3317
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:43,680
they've been used very minimally.

3318
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:46,920
And then he says secondly, "The state always steps in."

3319
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:50,370
He says, "Technically, theoretically it doesn't have to.

3320
02:20:50,370 --> 02:20:51,630
I could draw you a model,

3321
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:54,570
I could tell you about how it could work without the state.

3322
02:20:54,570 --> 02:20:56,610
But in actual reality,

3323
02:20:56,610 --> 02:20:59,760
all human societies through time and space,

3324
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:02,430
the state eventually becomes involved

3325
02:21:02,430 --> 02:21:03,600
in the provision of money,

3326
02:21:03,600 --> 02:21:06,840
because it has so many knock-on effects to so many people."

3327
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:09,660
So sure, I think he would, again,

3328
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:12,330
find a use case for crypto, think it's interesting,

3329
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:13,890
but I don't think he would see it

3330
02:21:13,890 --> 02:21:16,290
as this is going to displace state money

3331
02:21:16,290 --> 02:21:21,060
and we're going to have a variety of distributed currencies.

3332
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:24,360
The other thing he really stresses is that a change

3333
02:21:24,360 --> 02:21:25,770
in a monetary system,

3334
02:21:25,770 --> 02:21:28,860
it only happens amid great, great crisis.

3335
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:31,560
So again, you see in countries

3336
02:21:31,560 --> 02:21:34,470
where the state is not controlling the money well,

3337
02:21:34,470 --> 02:21:36,450
right, that's when people are more turning to crypto.

3338
02:21:36,450 --> 02:21:39,093
But he says, "Because money is so fundamental,

3339
02:21:39,960 --> 02:21:42,300
there are going to be so much political pressure

3340
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:47,300
on any country that gets the currency profoundly wrong

3341
02:21:47,310 --> 02:21:49,020
that the government will fall

3342
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:50,460
and another one will replace it."

3343
02:21:50,460 --> 02:21:52,710
So if you look at episodes of hyperinflation,

3344
02:21:53,610 --> 02:21:55,140
they don't go on very long,

3345
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:57,840
because they're so upsetting to people.

3346
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,490
- If we can go back in time,

3347
02:21:59,490 --> 02:22:01,140
we've talked about it a bunch,

3348
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:03,630
but it's still a fascinating time,

3349
02:22:03,630 --> 02:22:06,870
the Great Depression, University of Chicago.

3350
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:07,860
There's these folks

3351
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:12,450
like Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, Henry Simons.

3352
02:22:12,450 --> 02:22:15,450
All of these influence the thinking of Milton Friedman.

3353
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:19,590
There's this Room 7 situation, University of Chicago,

3354
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:21,870
just going back there,

3355
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:24,090
even just speaking almost philosophically,

3356
02:22:24,090 --> 02:22:27,180
what does it take to explore ideas together?

3357
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:30,540
Sort of like deliberate argue in that space.

3358
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:32,580
And maybe there might be interesting stories

3359
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:33,660
about that time.

3360
02:22:33,660 --> 02:22:34,710
It would just be interesting

3361
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:39,710
to understand how somebody like Milton Friedman forms.

3362
02:22:40,567 --> 02:22:43,410
(chuckles) The seed is planted and the flower blooms.

3363
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:44,550
- Yeah, yeah.

3364
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:47,640
So he gets to University of Chicago,

3365
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:49,950
he makes fast friends,

3366
02:22:49,950 --> 02:22:52,350
and in his third and fourth year,

3367
02:22:52,350 --> 02:22:54,780
they become what I call them, the Room 7 Gang.

3368
02:22:54,780 --> 02:22:57,990
So Room 7 is they find an old storeroom in the basement,

3369
02:22:57,990 --> 02:22:59,220
they take it over,

3370
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:01,350
and that's where they have their jam sessions.

3371
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:04,920
And what made this world come together was Frank Knight.

3372
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,810
There was a charismatic leader,

3373
02:23:06,810 --> 02:23:10,470
and there were a bunch of acolytes who clustered around him.

3374
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:12,810
That I think was a key piece of the ingredient.

3375
02:23:12,810 --> 02:23:14,580
And then there was a sense

3376
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:15,840
that they were onto something

3377
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:18,840
that the rest of the economics field had forgotten

3378
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:19,710
or was rejecting.

3379
02:23:19,710 --> 02:23:21,900
So there was like that sense of mission.

3380
02:23:21,900 --> 02:23:24,990
So that seems to have been,

3381
02:23:24,990 --> 02:23:27,480
there was a formal education piece,

3382
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:29,790
and then there was a parallel education piece

3383
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:32,250
rooted in admiration for a thinker,

3384
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:33,480
a shared admiration,

3385
02:23:33,480 --> 02:23:36,303
and then what that led Friedman to do,

3386
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:42,290
I found syllabi that he had from non-economics courses,

3387
02:23:42,510 --> 02:23:44,430
lists of books, and he'd written the prices

3388
02:23:44,430 --> 02:23:45,960
of different ones he wanted to read.

3389
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:48,330
So he had John Stuart Mill, "On Liberty,"

3390
02:23:48,330 --> 02:23:50,430
like "50 cents" written in the margin.

3391
02:23:50,430 --> 02:23:52,530
So he began to educate himself.

3392
02:23:52,530 --> 02:23:55,230
He gave himself a parallel curriculum

3393
02:23:55,230 --> 02:23:57,480
alongside this very formal economics curriculum.

3394
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:01,350
He started reading the traditions of political liberalism,

3395
02:24:01,350 --> 02:24:03,120
and then talking them through with friends,

3396
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:05,910
and then developing a shared sense of mission.

3397
02:24:05,910 --> 02:24:09,633
And the incredible thing is of those friends in the group,

3398
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:12,240
they scattered for like 10 years

3399
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:14,280
and then they all came back together.

3400
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:17,310
George Stigler, his great friend, was hired at Chicago.

3401
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:20,400
Aaron Director, who was his wife's brother,

3402
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:21,690
was at Chicago.

3403
02:24:21,690 --> 02:24:24,090
So many of these people continued.

3404
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:26,010
He became Frank Knight's colleague.

3405
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:28,320
So that was the base.

3406
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:29,700
That was what really grew him,

3407
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:32,400
that really profound peer group.

3408
02:24:32,400 --> 02:24:34,350
Now the other piece I talk about a lot

3409
02:24:34,350 --> 02:24:38,010
is Friedman was a collaborator,

3410
02:24:38,010 --> 02:24:39,480
an open-minded collaborator,

3411
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:41,310
and he had incredible connections

3412
02:24:41,310 --> 02:24:43,080
with economists who were women.

3413
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:47,550
And he basically found first in the figure of Anna Schwartz,

3414
02:24:47,550 --> 02:24:48,390
later in the figure

3415
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:51,750
of this group of women who were his wife's friends,

3416
02:24:51,750 --> 02:24:54,120
this kind of untapped pool of talent.

3417
02:24:54,120 --> 02:24:55,410
And so he immersed himself

3418
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:58,680
in this whole other world of consumption economics.

3419
02:24:58,680 --> 02:25:02,940
And that resulted in his more technical work on a theory

3420
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:04,080
of the consumption function,

3421
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:06,270
which is the theory of permanent income.

3422
02:25:06,270 --> 02:25:08,850
So for Friedman, intellectual work

3423
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:11,400
and intellectual production was always done

3424
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:13,680
in this very social context,

3425
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:16,620
in a context that blended friendship

3426
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:19,020
and intellectual partnership.

3427
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:22,080
And he only had a handful of friends

3428
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:24,300
who were not also economists

3429
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:25,920
interested in the same questions he was.

3430
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:29,633
So he just lived and breathed ideas all day long.

3431
02:25:29,633 --> 02:25:31,530
- Can you speak to the jam sessions?

3432
02:25:31,530 --> 02:25:33,690
Like what do we know about the jam sessions?

3433
02:25:33,690 --> 02:25:34,650
What are we talking about here?

3434
02:25:34,650 --> 02:25:37,500
You're sitting in a room, are they analyzing,

3435
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:38,430
are they reading papers

3436
02:25:38,430 --> 02:25:40,140
and discussing papers, or are they arguing

3437
02:25:40,140 --> 02:25:42,690
more like over beers kind of situation?

3438
02:25:42,690 --> 02:25:44,670
- Yeah, more arguing over beers.

3439
02:25:44,670 --> 02:25:46,830
And in this case,

3440
02:25:46,830 --> 02:25:47,783
there's several people who say,

3441
02:25:47,783 --> 02:25:50,250
"It was all about Frank Knight."

3442
02:25:50,250 --> 02:25:51,540
What did he say?

3443
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:53,040
What did he mean when he said it?

3444
02:25:53,040 --> 02:25:54,420
Is he right?

3445
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:56,010
And so Knight was very,

3446
02:25:56,010 --> 02:25:57,660
he would say one thing and then say another.

3447
02:25:57,660 --> 02:25:58,500
If you read him,

3448
02:25:58,500 --> 02:26:00,780
it's very hard to follow what he's actually saying,

3449
02:26:00,780 --> 02:26:03,510
because he's full of qualifications and irony as it blends.

3450
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:07,680
And so he would throw out these pieces,

3451
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:09,780
and then the students would kind of clutch at them,

3452
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:11,040
and then they would come back together

3453
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:12,870
and try to assemble this sort of worldview.

3454
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:15,990
And then Frank Knight fell into this terrible depression,

3455
02:26:15,990 --> 02:26:19,500
and to cheer him up, they planned a big party,

3456
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:23,040
and they went back through all of his previous writings,

3457
02:26:23,040 --> 02:26:25,650
and they assembled them into a book that was published.

3458
02:26:25,650 --> 02:26:27,210
This is "The Ethics of Competition."

3459
02:26:27,210 --> 02:26:29,010
And you can read the introduction written in part

3460
02:26:29,010 --> 02:26:29,850
by Milton Friedman.

3461
02:26:29,850 --> 02:26:33,120
So not only were they talking about Knight and what he said,

3462
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:36,000
but then they started pouring over his work.

3463
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,290
And one of them described it

3464
02:26:37,290 --> 02:26:39,870
as like a general equilibrium system where you had

3465
02:26:39,870 --> 02:26:41,850
to know all the parts, and then all of a sudden,

3466
02:26:41,850 --> 02:26:43,860
it all fit together in a whole.

3467
02:26:43,860 --> 02:26:45,660
So if we step back,

3468
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:47,310
what they were doing was getting

3469
02:26:47,310 --> 02:26:49,620
inside the mind of a great thinker

3470
02:26:49,620 --> 02:26:52,170
and understanding the ways it all fit together,

3471
02:26:52,170 --> 02:26:55,770
and then kind of testing their ideas against Knight's.

3472
02:26:55,770 --> 02:26:57,660
And what's fascinating is one

3473
02:26:57,660 --> 02:27:02,130
of the first papers that Friedman publishes in statistics

3474
02:27:02,130 --> 02:27:04,620
is a rebuttal of Frank Knight.

3475
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:07,260
He publishes a rebuttal of Frank Knight's ideas

3476
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:09,240
about risk and uncertainty.

3477
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:10,094
And Frank Knight,

3478
02:27:10,094 --> 02:27:12,450
he kind of took a black swan argument.

3479
02:27:12,450 --> 02:27:14,163
He said, "Risk, you can calculate.

3480
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,110
Uncertainty, you can't existentially, philosophically,

3481
02:27:19,110 --> 02:27:20,750
you can't get your hands around it.

3482
02:27:20,750 --> 02:27:22,290
It is the black swan."

3483
02:27:22,290 --> 02:27:25,027
And Friedman publishes this statistical paper, and he says,

3484
02:27:25,027 --> 02:27:27,960
"I can put uncertainty on a graph."

3485
02:27:27,960 --> 02:27:30,300
And so there's that sort of Freudian killing

3486
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:32,550
of the father element when he comes back.

3487
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:35,250
And he will, in some ways,

3488
02:27:35,250 --> 02:27:38,610
turn his back on Knight's approach and Knight's pessimism,

3489
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:41,133
even while it's like a foundation of his thinking.

3490
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:43,920
- Fascinating.

3491
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:44,880
Is there something you could say

3492
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:49,410
about the thinking process that Milton Friedman followed,

3493
02:27:49,410 --> 02:27:52,710
like how he developed his ideas?

3494
02:27:52,710 --> 02:27:55,530
You mentioned there's a strong collaborative component.

3495
02:27:55,530 --> 02:27:57,750
But there's another story I saw

3496
02:27:57,750 --> 02:28:02,750
about that I think his son recalled

3497
02:28:03,210 --> 02:28:05,567
about the argument number system you mentioned.

3498
02:28:05,567 --> 02:28:06,400
- [Jennifer] Yes.

3499
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,233
- Which I, by the way,

3500
02:28:07,233 --> 02:28:10,230
if you can explain that as a tangent of a tangent,

3501
02:28:10,230 --> 02:28:11,430
that's really awesome.

3502
02:28:11,430 --> 02:28:13,140
I think it's like, number one,

3503
02:28:13,140 --> 02:28:14,970
if the other person is right.

3504
02:28:14,970 --> 02:28:19,200
- Number two means you were right and I was wrong.

3505
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:23,400
And the number system evolved in some ways to be quick

3506
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:24,690
and efficient, but in other ways,

3507
02:28:24,690 --> 02:28:26,160
they also were really clear about it.

3508
02:28:26,160 --> 02:28:28,860
So, you know something like there's

3509
02:28:28,860 --> 02:28:30,330
kind of like three reasons behind it.

3510
02:28:30,330 --> 02:28:32,400
First is if you use a number,

3511
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:36,390
it reminds the listener that it's really hard

3512
02:28:36,390 --> 02:28:39,510
to say the words, "I was wrong."

3513
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:42,390
So you're kind of calling on their sympathy

3514
02:28:42,390 --> 02:28:43,290
by using the number,

3515
02:28:43,290 --> 02:28:45,000
reminding them that you're doing a hard thing.

3516
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,510
And then it's also reminding them

3517
02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:51,240
that you're in this family with this code.

3518
02:28:51,240 --> 02:28:54,540
And so you're signaling your membership

3519
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:57,030
and your closeness and your love, really.

3520
02:28:57,030 --> 02:28:59,220
And so it's supposed to be an easy way

3521
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:01,150
to disagree without like breaking the relationship.

3522
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:04,950
- Yeah, so admitting you're wrong now comes

3523
02:29:04,950 --> 02:29:06,570
with this warm fuzzy feeling.

3524
02:29:06,570 --> 02:29:07,620
- [Jennifer] Yeah, yeah.

3525
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:10,800
- And that's really, I mean, that's so powerful.

3526
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:14,100
I think so much of the friction

3527
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:16,350
of human interaction could be boiled down

3528
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:19,890
to just not being able to admit they are wrong efficiently

3529
02:29:19,890 --> 02:29:23,550
and quickly and regularly and just often.

3530
02:29:23,550 --> 02:29:26,460
And to be able to do that, that's really powerful.

3531
02:29:26,460 --> 02:29:28,770
- Yeah, I think it's a really neat aspect

3532
02:29:28,770 --> 02:29:31,680
of their family life, for sure. (chuckles)

3533
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:33,000
- That's a fun story.

3534
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:36,540
But can we just generalize to how he engaged

3535
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:39,360
in collaboration, how he developed his ideas?

3536
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:41,880
Is there a thinking process?

3537
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:43,770
- So he taught at the University of Chicago

3538
02:29:43,770 --> 02:29:45,540
and he tended to teach for six months

3539
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:46,950
and then have six months off.

3540
02:29:46,950 --> 02:29:50,310
And he spent the summers in New Hampshire or Vermont.

3541
02:29:50,310 --> 02:29:51,750
He had, right near that border,

3542
02:29:51,750 --> 02:29:52,890
they had two different houses.

3543
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:56,040
And that to him was the deep thinking time.

3544
02:29:56,040 --> 02:29:58,410
And so when he's at Chicago,

3545
02:29:58,410 --> 02:30:00,453
he's teaching, he's arguing.

3546
02:30:01,320 --> 02:30:03,690
Some people loved his teaching style.

3547
02:30:03,690 --> 02:30:05,220
Very much in charge,

3548
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:08,610
very much keeping students on their toes, confrontational.

3549
02:30:08,610 --> 02:30:11,370
Others found it too much, overwhelming,

3550
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:12,900
kind of shut them down intellectually,

3551
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:15,030
and they couldn't cope with it.

3552
02:30:15,030 --> 02:30:18,960
And so I think it was kind of go time when he was teaching.

3553
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:21,480
In that case, that was a lot of social time,

3554
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:23,790
interacting, talking other professors,

3555
02:30:23,790 --> 02:30:25,290
going out and giving papers,

3556
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:27,600
arguing with the people at Yale or Harvard.

3557
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:28,710
Then he would go

3558
02:30:28,710 --> 02:30:31,380
and do these very deep dives over the summer.

3559
02:30:31,380 --> 02:30:33,450
He would also regularly do these trips

3560
02:30:33,450 --> 02:30:35,880
to New York to see Anna Schwartz,

3561
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:37,650
so his a 12-year collaborator.

3562
02:30:37,650 --> 02:30:39,450
Phone calls were really expensive.

3563
02:30:39,450 --> 02:30:41,280
They did have quite an extensive correspondence.

3564
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:42,480
But then they would do these meetings.

3565
02:30:42,480 --> 02:30:44,550
So he would basically come in

3566
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:46,800
at the beginning of this summer,

3567
02:30:46,800 --> 02:30:49,680
going to Rahway, stop in New York, see Schwartz,

3568
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:51,750
and then again on the way back to Chicago.

3569
02:30:51,750 --> 02:30:54,090
So you'd have these deep check-ins at that point.

3570
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:56,610
The other thing that happened is people would come visit him

3571
02:30:56,610 --> 02:30:59,790
in New Hampshire, and so he would have these,

3572
02:30:59,790 --> 02:31:01,500
he had a studio separate from the house.

3573
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:02,490
He would go and he would work,

3574
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:04,740
and then at night his friends would come.

3575
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:06,000
His friends are all economists.

3576
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,130
There's a whole like cluster of economists.

3577
02:31:08,130 --> 02:31:10,590
They all clustered within driving distance

3578
02:31:10,590 --> 02:31:11,880
of the Dartmouth Library,

3579
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:14,130
so that they could get their hands on books.

3580
02:31:14,130 --> 02:31:15,390
And so they would come over

3581
02:31:15,390 --> 02:31:18,000
and then they would argue and talk into the night.

3582
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:22,230
So I think he did need that deep focus time,

3583
02:31:22,230 --> 02:31:23,313
but it was not,

3584
02:31:23,313 --> 02:31:26,100
like he also lived a very engaged,

3585
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:28,620
very embedded social life.

3586
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:31,023
- A part of which was his marriage.

3587
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:34,830
Is there something you could say about love, about marriage,

3588
02:31:34,830 --> 02:31:36,810
about relationship that made the whole thing work?

3589
02:31:36,810 --> 02:31:38,310
Because it was vibrant.

3590
02:31:38,310 --> 02:31:40,530
And they wrote a biography together.

3591
02:31:40,530 --> 02:31:41,363
- They did.

3592
02:31:41,363 --> 02:31:42,780
I mean, they were very complimentary.

3593
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:44,880
They were kind of the yin and the yang.

3594
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,760
She was very introverted,

3595
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:51,450
somewhat suspicious of others, skeptical,

3596
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:56,450
and he was extremely extroverted, optimistic, high energy.

3597
02:31:57,450 --> 02:32:01,470
And they also were at a time when it was really clear, like,

3598
02:32:01,470 --> 02:32:03,450
for broader society, these are the roles of a man,

3599
02:32:03,450 --> 02:32:05,280
these are the roles of a woman.

3600
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:06,660
And they pretty much adopted those.

3601
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:11,310
Now, Rose Friedman did some very important economic work.

3602
02:32:11,310 --> 02:32:12,630
She's part of the early stages

3603
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:14,820
of the theory of the consumption function.

3604
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:16,200
She didn't complete her degree,

3605
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:18,720
because she really knew there wasn't,

3606
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:20,280
if she wanted to be married

3607
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:21,720
and have children in the world she lived in,

3608
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:24,843
there wasn't a real pathway to also being an economist.

3609
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:28,233
I do think that a lot of that,

3610
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:30,720
although it feels very gendered,

3611
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:33,780
like he's the man out in the world and she's in private.

3612
02:32:33,780 --> 02:32:35,700
It's interesting because her brother, Aaron Director,

3613
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:36,533
was the same way.

3614
02:32:36,533 --> 02:32:39,810
He was very private man, very shy, very introverted.

3615
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:42,330
And he exerted this quiet intellectual influence

3616
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:44,070
on all of his friends.

3617
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:45,480
So I think that was just

3618
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:48,270
kind of a family trait of being more quiet,

3619
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:50,250
preferring to be behind the scenes.

3620
02:32:50,250 --> 02:32:51,263
It wouldn't have worked any other way,

3621
02:32:51,263 --> 02:32:54,330
because Friedman was so out there,

3622
02:32:54,330 --> 02:32:57,690
so, you know, so extroverted.

3623
02:32:57,690 --> 02:32:59,730
And there's a bit of a sad thing she said.

3624
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:01,890
She said, "When I married Milton,

3625
02:33:01,890 --> 02:33:04,350
I lost half of my conversations.

3626
02:33:04,350 --> 02:33:07,350
When David came along, I lost the other half."

3627
02:33:07,350 --> 02:33:10,680
So this is a household that was just dominated

3628
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:13,830
by male voices in which she didn't have a lot of room.

3629
02:33:13,830 --> 02:33:14,663
What was tricky

3630
02:33:14,663 --> 02:33:17,640
for me in my research is she didn't leave much of a trace.

3631
02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:19,980
She put together Milton Friedman's archive

3632
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:21,300
and she took herself out of it.

3633
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:25,290
So I really had trouble finding her actual voice

3634
02:33:25,290 --> 02:33:26,640
in the historical documents.

3635
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:28,830
And she didn't want to leave that behind.

3636
02:33:28,830 --> 02:33:32,490
So absolutely essential piece of his success,

3637
02:33:32,490 --> 02:33:33,990
because she's the one who pushed him

3638
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:36,960
to do the "Newsweek" column, to do "Free to Choose,"

3639
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:39,420
and she really wrote "Capitalism and Freedom."

3640
02:33:39,420 --> 02:33:41,262
She took all his random notes,

3641
02:33:41,262 --> 02:33:43,017
and she put them together into a book.

3642
02:33:43,017 --> 02:33:45,930
And that became this kind of testimony of his ideas.

3643
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:48,780
But she shared many of his ideas.

3644
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:50,850
And she, you know, without,

3645
02:33:50,850 --> 02:33:53,670
when I think of Friedman, if you take away Anna Schwartz,

3646
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:54,930
if you take away Rose Friedman,

3647
02:33:54,930 --> 02:33:57,690
if you take away the other woman who collaborated with him,

3648
02:33:57,690 --> 02:34:01,200
you have a much thinner resume than the one he actually has.

3649
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:02,033
- Yeah, it's always sad,

3650
02:34:02,033 --> 02:34:07,033
and it always makes me wonder about the private,

3651
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:10,440
secret conversations between partners,

3652
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:14,340
because they might not show up in the record,

3653
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:16,740
but they probably influence the person

3654
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:18,720
more than almost anything else,

3655
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:20,793
those quiet little conversations.

3656
02:34:21,720 --> 02:34:22,613
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

3657
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:28,880
- If we can switch our path to another great mind

3658
02:34:30,570 --> 02:34:32,883
of the 20th century, Ayn Rand.

3659
02:34:34,440 --> 02:34:36,360
We talked about some of the similarities here,

3660
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:38,190
about them being fighters for freedom

3661
02:34:38,190 --> 02:34:41,280
and fighters for capitalism.

3662
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,680
What is Ayn Rand's philosophy?

3663
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:47,250
If you can give a big 10,000-word summary of Objectivism.

3664
02:34:47,250 --> 02:34:50,070
- Yes, so she called it Objectivism.

3665
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:51,000
She used to do this thing,

3666
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:54,070
like I can stand on one foot and say it.

3667
02:34:54,070 --> 02:34:55,503
So it goes something like,

3668
02:34:56,737 --> 02:34:59,580
"Epistemology, reason, ethics,

3669
02:34:59,580 --> 02:35:02,580
selfishness, politics, capitalism."

3670
02:35:02,580 --> 02:35:04,110
That was kind of how she summarized it.

3671
02:35:04,110 --> 02:35:05,760
So what she did.

3672
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:08,160
There's a couple things she did with Objectivism.

3673
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:11,670
First of all, she says the key defining element

3674
02:35:11,670 --> 02:35:14,430
of humanity is rationalism, the rational faculty.

3675
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:17,760
So that's what defines what humanity is.

3676
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:20,730
Therefore, there is an objective reality that we can access

3677
02:35:20,730 --> 02:35:22,350
and know with our reason.

3678
02:35:22,350 --> 02:35:24,030
That's the objective epistemology.

3679
02:35:24,030 --> 02:35:26,010
And the one social

3680
02:35:26,010 --> 02:35:30,600
and economic system that lets rationality flower

3681
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:33,570
and is based upon rationality is capitalism.

3682
02:35:33,570 --> 02:35:37,800
And then rationality only works in her view,

3683
02:35:37,800 --> 02:35:40,200
as an individual capacity.

3684
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:42,090
And that rationality teaches

3685
02:35:42,090 --> 02:35:47,090
that what you should do is pursue your interests.

3686
02:35:47,430 --> 02:35:50,700
And so she ends up calling that selfishness.

3687
02:35:50,700 --> 02:35:55,410
Now, it's tricky because selfishness has so many strong

3688
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:57,510
and negative connotations.

3689
02:35:57,510 --> 02:35:59,910
And she meant, I think,

3690
02:35:59,910 --> 02:36:03,540
something closer to like self-actualization,

3691
02:36:03,540 --> 02:36:08,340
because she really tried to create this idea

3692
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:09,930
and express the idea that

3693
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:14,930
to be truly selfish did not mean trampling on others.

3694
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:18,120
It meant just being motivated

3695
02:36:18,120 --> 02:36:23,070
by your own kind of internal measures and metrics.

3696
02:36:23,070 --> 02:36:26,870
And so in her fiction, she tries to show this

3697
02:36:26,870 --> 02:36:31,320
by showing the false selfishness of some of Peter Keating,

3698
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:33,690
who's an architect who kind of steps over everybody

3699
02:36:33,690 --> 02:36:35,550
to advance his career.

3700
02:36:35,550 --> 02:36:37,320
And she says, "That's not true selfishness,

3701
02:36:37,320 --> 02:36:40,860
because true selfishness would recognize it's false

3702
02:36:40,860 --> 02:36:43,800
to take others work and pass it off as your own."

3703
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:44,730
Now, the other big piece

3704
02:36:44,730 --> 02:36:49,480
of Objectivism is a very approach that's really inspired

3705
02:36:50,520 --> 02:36:53,400
and related to Friedrich Nietzsche's idea

3706
02:36:53,400 --> 02:36:58,350
of revaluing values or a genealogy of morals.

3707
02:36:58,350 --> 02:37:01,800
And so she says, "What's happened here

3708
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:04,950
is Western culture has converged

3709
02:37:04,950 --> 02:37:07,465
on this idea of altruism as good,

3710
02:37:07,465 --> 02:37:11,190
being selfless and altruistic is good.

3711
02:37:11,190 --> 02:37:14,250
And this has led us to communism,

3712
02:37:14,250 --> 02:37:16,380
and has led us to devalue the individual

3713
02:37:16,380 --> 02:37:17,790
in favor of the Collective.

3714
02:37:17,790 --> 02:37:20,400
So what we need is a new moral code

3715
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:22,267
which elevates selfishness,

3716
02:37:22,267 --> 02:37:23,907
which elevates the individual,

3717
02:37:23,907 --> 02:37:25,470
and which takes all the things

3718
02:37:25,470 --> 02:37:27,630
that we have been told are bad

3719
02:37:27,630 --> 02:37:29,850
and actually says their values."

3720
02:37:29,850 --> 02:37:32,130
This is what she's trying to do with Objectivism.

3721
02:37:32,130 --> 02:37:33,060
I mean, it is about

3722
02:37:33,060 --> 02:37:36,660
as ambitious of an intellectual project as there can be,

3723
02:37:36,660 --> 02:37:40,320
and that's what really draws people in.

3724
02:37:40,320 --> 02:37:41,340
Yet at the same time,

3725
02:37:41,340 --> 02:37:45,750
she's flying in the face of the way human morals

3726
02:37:45,750 --> 02:37:48,150
and ethics in societies have evolved,

3727
02:37:48,150 --> 02:37:51,360
and she's not able to single handedly recreate them

3728
02:37:51,360 --> 02:37:52,770
the way she wants them to be.

3729
02:37:52,770 --> 02:37:55,380
- Yeah, I mean, she's not doing herself any favors

3730
02:37:55,380 --> 02:37:56,790
by like taking on the words

3731
02:37:56,790 --> 02:37:58,950
and trying to rebrand them completely,

3732
02:37:58,950 --> 02:38:01,650
like writing "The Virtue of Selfishness."

3733
02:38:01,650 --> 02:38:04,680
It's like, can we just call it self-actualization?

3734
02:38:04,680 --> 02:38:05,513
- Yeah.

3735
02:38:05,513 --> 02:38:07,740
- There's a negative connotation to selfishness

3736
02:38:07,740 --> 02:38:10,560
and a positive connotation to altruism.

3737
02:38:10,560 --> 02:38:13,620
So she sometimes, it seems,

3738
02:38:13,620 --> 02:38:18,060
takes on the hardest possible form of argument.

3739
02:38:18,060 --> 02:38:21,183
- Yeah, I mean, she had a student,

3740
02:38:22,020 --> 02:38:24,180
who ended up being very close to her, Nathaniel Branden,

3741
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:25,507
and he was the reverend advisor, and he said,

3742
02:38:25,507 --> 02:38:27,180
"Can you please not use selfishness?

3743
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:28,560
Like just come up with another word."

3744
02:38:28,560 --> 02:38:30,720
But part of her liked it.

3745
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:33,420
Part of her wanted to provoke and unsettle.

3746
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:34,680
She didn't want to give that up.

3747
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:39,423
- I mean, people should listen to her public talks.

3748
02:38:42,900 --> 02:38:46,710
Her whole aura, way of being is provocative,

3749
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:49,800
and she's a real powerhouse of an intellectual.

3750
02:38:49,800 --> 02:38:51,840
So like she loves the challenge,

3751
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:56,490
and that just listening to her in itself is just inspiring

3752
02:38:56,490 --> 02:39:01,410
because you could see the individualism radiate from her.

3753
02:39:01,410 --> 02:39:04,710
- Yeah, I mean, that was one of the things I found

3754
02:39:04,710 --> 02:39:06,420
in researching and writing about her.

3755
02:39:06,420 --> 02:39:09,266
Like, she's an incredibly unusual human being, you know?

3756
02:39:09,266 --> 02:39:10,099
(Lex chuckles)

3757
02:39:10,099 --> 02:39:12,750
And so that was like her strength,

3758
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:13,770
because she's so unusual,

3759
02:39:13,770 --> 02:39:14,880
but it was also her downfall

3760
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:17,760
because she looked to herself as a model

3761
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:20,880
or to get insight about humanity,

3762
02:39:20,880 --> 02:39:23,460
and she never quite processed how different she was

3763
02:39:23,460 --> 02:39:24,840
from other people.

3764
02:39:24,840 --> 02:39:28,470
- So just because we talked about Milton Friedman so much,

3765
02:39:28,470 --> 02:39:31,680
can we just return to what to you,

3766
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:32,940
given everything we've said,

3767
02:39:32,940 --> 02:39:36,630
is the interesting differences about Ayn Rand,

3768
02:39:36,630 --> 02:39:41,630
her ideas, related to Milton Friedman?

3769
02:39:44,100 --> 02:39:46,137
- Yeah, I mean, broadly, we could put Milton Friedman

3770
02:39:46,137 --> 02:39:48,840
and Ayn Rand in some sort of category together,

3771
02:39:48,840 --> 02:39:53,840
but she has this focus on ethics and rationality

3772
02:39:56,010 --> 02:39:58,710
and this desire to be revolutionary

3773
02:39:58,710 --> 02:40:00,960
that's much stronger than Friedman.

3774
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:04,800
Friedman wanted to overthrow the economic consensus.

3775
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:07,140
He didn't want to overturn the moral basis

3776
02:40:07,140 --> 02:40:08,793
of Western society.

3777
02:40:09,960 --> 02:40:12,330
Also so she does something.

3778
02:40:12,330 --> 02:40:14,130
So in one of Frank Knight's essays,

3779
02:40:14,130 --> 02:40:16,260
he talks about "The Ethics of Competition."

3780
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:19,950
And he says, "You basically cannot build an ethics

3781
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:21,090
out of competition,

3782
02:40:21,090 --> 02:40:23,640
because it would be monstrous to do so,

3783
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:25,620
because it would say,

3784
02:40:25,620 --> 02:40:28,860
'The winner of this competition is ethically right.'

3785
02:40:28,860 --> 02:40:31,830
And that would open the door to sort of might makes right."

3786
02:40:31,830 --> 02:40:33,450
And this is what Friedman struggles with.

3787
02:40:33,450 --> 02:40:37,020
And he says, "I can't take capitalist outcomes

3788
02:40:37,020 --> 02:40:38,430
as ethical unto themselves.

3789
02:40:38,430 --> 02:40:39,263
I can't do it.

3790
02:40:39,263 --> 02:40:40,620
Doesn't feel right."

3791
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:42,457
And there's this line where Frank Knight says,

3792
02:40:42,457 --> 02:40:43,710
"No one would ever do this."

3793
02:40:43,710 --> 02:40:45,450
And I was like, "Oh, Frank Knight,

3794
02:40:45,450 --> 02:40:46,312
you haven't read Ayn Rand yet."

3795
02:40:46,312 --> 02:40:47,370
(Lex and Jennifer chuckle)

3796
02:40:47,370 --> 02:40:48,210
- Hold my beer, yeah.

3797
02:40:48,210 --> 02:40:49,260
- You're a little too early.

3798
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:50,430
Because that's what she does.

3799
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:52,830
She takes the outcomes of capitalism

3800
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:54,667
and of market competition and says,

3801
02:40:54,667 --> 02:40:56,730
"These have ethical meaning,

3802
02:40:56,730 --> 02:40:58,980
and this is where ethical meaning inheres,

3803
02:40:58,980 --> 02:41:02,520
and it is ethical to try to succeed

3804
02:41:02,520 --> 02:41:04,110
and to succeed in a capitalist society."

3805
02:41:04,110 --> 02:41:07,380
Now, what she's able to do is create a fictional world

3806
02:41:07,380 --> 02:41:08,430
in which people succeed

3807
02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:12,570
in her fictional capitalist world through ethical behavior.

3808
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:13,770
And so she doesn't really have

3809
02:41:13,770 --> 02:41:16,410
to wrestle with a capitalist world

3810
02:41:16,410 --> 02:41:18,870
in which people succeed through fraud and corruption

3811
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:21,810
and all the other things that might go

3812
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:22,920
into someone's success.

3813
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:25,920
She creates the best possible take

3814
02:41:25,920 --> 02:41:27,960
on success under capitalism.

3815
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:29,730
And then she holds that up as an ideal.

3816
02:41:29,730 --> 02:41:32,130
And I think what's important is that

3817
02:41:32,130 --> 02:41:33,630
so few people have done that.

3818
02:41:33,630 --> 02:41:34,770
And she comes at a time

3819
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:38,010
when everybody is emphasizing the downsides of capitalism.

3820
02:41:38,010 --> 02:41:40,170
And she says, "There's another way to look at it.

3821
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:42,210
Here are the good sides of capitalism."

3822
02:41:42,210 --> 02:41:43,830
- And like you said, "She was operating,"

3823
02:41:43,830 --> 02:41:46,027
which I really loved the phrasing of that,

3824
02:41:46,027 --> 02:41:48,641
"in the mythic register."

3825
02:41:48,641 --> 02:41:49,474
- Yeah.

3826
02:41:49,474 --> 02:41:52,230
- So she was constructing these characters,

3827
02:41:52,230 --> 02:41:56,310
these capitalists that are like the highest form,

3828
02:41:56,310 --> 02:41:58,500
these great heroic figures,

3829
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,240
almost romanticizing them.

3830
02:42:00,240 --> 02:42:01,740
- [Jennifer] Yeah, yeah.

3831
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:02,820
- You mentioned "We the Living"

3832
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:06,660
is one of the books that you like of hers the most.

3833
02:42:06,660 --> 02:42:09,630
But can we stay in the mythic register

3834
02:42:09,630 --> 02:42:12,840
with "The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged?"

3835
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:16,863
What to you are some sort of memorable, inspiring moments,

3836
02:42:17,850 --> 02:42:22,850
insightful moments from those books that may be scenes

3837
02:42:23,070 --> 02:42:26,853
or ideas that you take away from them

3838
02:42:26,853 --> 02:42:30,407
that are important for people to understand?

3839
02:42:30,407 --> 02:42:31,240
- Yeah.

3840
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:33,480
So "The Fountainhead" is this story

3841
02:42:33,480 --> 02:42:37,230
of a struggling architect, Howard Roark,

3842
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:40,650
and she kind of follows his life and his career.

3843
02:42:40,650 --> 02:42:42,466
And the message is really,

3844
02:42:42,466 --> 02:42:45,960
it's a version of to thine own self be true.

3845
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:49,800
And Roark's designs are too avant garde.

3846
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:51,090
Nobody appreciates him,

3847
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:54,570
and he just keeps doing what he wants to do

3848
02:42:54,570 --> 02:42:57,930
and is just focused on his own visions, his own genius.

3849
02:42:57,930 --> 02:42:59,520
I think that's been really inspiring

3850
02:42:59,520 --> 02:43:01,350
to kind of creators of all types.

3851
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:03,780
I think it's fairly unrealistic

3852
02:43:03,780 --> 02:43:06,060
as a portrait of human achievement,

3853
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:07,680
but it's an aspirational idea.

3854
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:09,120
I mean, one phrase that comes

3855
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:12,540
to mind is there's a character, I forget which one,

3856
02:43:12,540 --> 02:43:14,280
who is in some sort

3857
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:16,470
of adversarial relationship with Howard Roark

3858
02:43:16,470 --> 02:43:17,377
and says something to him like,

3859
02:43:17,377 --> 02:43:20,250
"Well, Mr. Roark, what do you think of me?"

3860
02:43:20,250 --> 02:43:22,800
And Roark says, "I don't think of you."

3861
02:43:22,800 --> 02:43:25,350
And that, to Rand, was the ideal.

3862
02:43:25,350 --> 02:43:27,090
You're not thinking of other people.

3863
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:29,850
You're an island unto yourself.

3864
02:43:29,850 --> 02:43:32,370
You know, you're focused on your own goals,

3865
02:43:32,370 --> 02:43:33,960
your own capacities.

3866
02:43:33,960 --> 02:43:36,310
And you're not doing it to impress other people

3867
02:43:36,310 --> 02:43:37,950
or to be better than other people

3868
02:43:37,950 --> 02:43:38,783
or to dominate other people.

3869
02:43:38,783 --> 02:43:39,630
You're doing it

3870
02:43:39,630 --> 02:43:43,560
because you're sort of expressing your inner soul in a way.

3871
02:43:43,560 --> 02:43:47,370
So that has been very captivating to so many.

3872
02:43:47,370 --> 02:43:49,350
And "The Fountainhead" is one of those books we talked

3873
02:43:49,350 --> 02:43:50,526
about that causes, you know,

3874
02:43:50,526 --> 02:43:52,340
people read it and they make changes in their life

3875
02:43:52,340 --> 02:43:55,350
or they feel called to their higher self.

3876
02:43:55,350 --> 02:43:58,770
- And I think there's also the scene where Roark

3877
02:43:58,770 --> 02:44:01,140
with the dean of architecture school that's speaking

3878
02:44:01,140 --> 02:44:02,940
to what you're saying,

3879
02:44:02,940 --> 02:44:05,310
I think, to me is inspiring.

3880
02:44:05,310 --> 02:44:09,390
So this is the dean of architecture that expels Roark,

3881
02:44:09,390 --> 02:44:10,920
and it brings him into a meeting,

3882
02:44:10,920 --> 02:44:13,110
thinking Roark will plead for a second chance.

3883
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:16,980
And the dean says that Roark's work, "Is contrary

3884
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:19,230
to every principle we have tried to teach you,

3885
02:44:19,230 --> 02:44:22,500
contrary to all established precedents

3886
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:24,360
and traditions of art.

3887
02:44:24,360 --> 02:44:26,520
Do you mean to tell me that you're thinking seriously

3888
02:44:26,520 --> 02:44:30,810
of building that way when and if you are an architect?"

3889
02:44:30,810 --> 02:44:32,910
And then in a gangster-like way,

3890
02:44:32,910 --> 02:44:34,710
Roark says, "Yes."

3891
02:44:34,710 --> 02:44:35,917
And then Dean asks,

3892
02:44:35,917 --> 02:44:38,280
"My dear fellow, who will let you?"

3893
02:44:38,280 --> 02:44:40,890
And Roark replies, "That's not the point.

3894
02:44:40,890 --> 02:44:44,280
The point is, who will stop me?"

3895
02:44:44,280 --> 02:44:45,510
- Yes, I mean, you know,

3896
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:47,340
Rand is coming from Communist Russia,

3897
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:50,010
but it has a bit of the don't-mess-with-Texas flavor.

3898
02:44:50,010 --> 02:44:52,860
You know, I might say that really resonates with this idea

3899
02:44:52,860 --> 02:44:53,880
of anyone who's felt

3900
02:44:53,880 --> 02:44:56,163
like they're fighting the powers that be.

3901
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:58,193
Yeah, it's interesting.

3902
02:44:58,193 --> 02:45:00,270
I thought you might be going

3903
02:45:00,270 --> 02:45:02,827
to the quote where he says something like,

3904
02:45:02,827 --> 02:45:05,250
"I inherit no tradition.

3905
02:45:05,250 --> 02:45:07,260
I stand at the beginning of one."

3906
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:08,790
And I really think Rand's thinking

3907
02:45:08,790 --> 02:45:11,730
about herself when she says that she inherits nothing.

3908
02:45:11,730 --> 02:45:12,870
She stands at the start.

3909
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:14,910
But "The Fountainhead" comes out

3910
02:45:14,910 --> 02:45:16,650
in the middle of World War II,

3911
02:45:16,650 --> 02:45:18,870
and it's not expected.

3912
02:45:18,870 --> 02:45:20,520
Rand is an unknown writer.

3913
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:21,900
This is kind of a strange book.

3914
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:23,280
It's, you know, classic story.

3915
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:25,110
It's turned down by 12 publishers

3916
02:45:25,110 --> 02:45:27,270
before one takes a chance on it.

3917
02:45:27,270 --> 02:45:29,490
And Rand really loved this story.

3918
02:45:29,490 --> 02:45:32,280
The editor who read it said, "This book is great."

3919
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:33,930
And his boss said, "No."

3920
02:45:33,930 --> 02:45:35,167
And he said,

3921
02:45:35,167 --> 02:45:37,770
"If you don't take this book, I'm quitting," you know?

3922
02:45:37,770 --> 02:45:40,590
And so she idolized him for doing that.

3923
02:45:40,590 --> 02:45:41,850
So they print it,

3924
02:45:41,850 --> 02:45:45,000
and it becomes a bestseller just through word of mouth.

3925
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:46,680
So it's not advertised.

3926
02:45:46,680 --> 02:45:47,820
It gets one good book review,

3927
02:45:47,820 --> 02:45:51,330
but people tell each other how much they like this book.

3928
02:45:51,330 --> 02:45:53,460
And it keeps printing and selling out printings.

3929
02:45:53,460 --> 02:45:54,630
It's made into a movie.

3930
02:45:54,630 --> 02:45:58,020
And so it lands in this time when Americans are engaged

3931
02:45:58,020 --> 02:46:00,300
in this great collective endeavor of World War II.

3932
02:46:00,300 --> 02:46:03,720
They're making all kinds of sacrifices for the Collective.

3933
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:05,610
And I think paradoxically, as they do that,

3934
02:46:05,610 --> 02:46:06,810
they're drawn to this vision

3935
02:46:06,810 --> 02:46:09,810
of someone who doesn't have to compromise at all,

3936
02:46:09,810 --> 02:46:12,480
who is leading their life exactly as they want to.

3937
02:46:12,480 --> 02:46:13,320
You know, meanwhile,

3938
02:46:13,320 --> 02:46:15,360
they might be sleeping on an ocean liner

3939
02:46:15,360 --> 02:46:17,070
because they've been drafted to fight in this war.

3940
02:46:17,070 --> 02:46:18,090
And they're reading "The Fountainhead"

3941
02:46:18,090 --> 02:46:19,560
and they're feeling better about themselves.

3942
02:46:19,560 --> 02:46:21,517
And so it's also really interesting.

3943
02:46:21,517 --> 02:46:24,480
"The Fountainhead" is hugely popular in India,

3944
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:25,560
which is fascinating.

3945
02:46:25,560 --> 02:46:27,810
And I've talk to people about this,

3946
02:46:27,810 --> 02:46:29,707
and they basically say,

3947
02:46:29,707 --> 02:46:32,040
"This book comes like a breath of fresh air

3948
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:34,380
into a very traditional and conformist culture,

3949
02:46:34,380 --> 02:46:36,927
and people just latch onto it and they love it.

3950
02:46:36,927 --> 02:46:38,670
And it gives them that feeling of freedom

3951
02:46:38,670 --> 02:46:40,950
and possibility that they're hoping for."

3952
02:46:40,950 --> 02:46:43,327
- Yeah, I mean, it really is a book,

3953
02:46:43,327 --> 02:46:45,869
"Atlas Shrugged" can be a bit of that too,

3954
02:46:45,869 --> 02:46:48,870
but it's more the philosophy of Objectivism

3955
02:46:48,870 --> 02:46:50,490
and the details and the nuance of that

3956
02:46:50,490 --> 02:46:52,207
seeps into "Atlas Shrugged."

3957
02:46:52,207 --> 02:46:55,200
"The Fountainhead" is very much like a thing

3958
02:46:55,200 --> 02:46:57,750
that makes you change the path of your life.

3959
02:46:57,750 --> 02:46:58,650
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

3960
02:46:58,650 --> 02:46:59,483
- And that, I mean,

3961
02:46:59,483 --> 02:47:02,610
that's beautiful to see that books can have that power.

3962
02:47:02,610 --> 02:47:06,674
- And, you know, Rand knew that she was doing that

3963
02:47:06,674 --> 02:47:09,360
and she knew what she was doing.

3964
02:47:09,360 --> 02:47:10,440
This wasn't an accident.

3965
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:12,450
And people say, "Oh, she's a bad writer.

3966
02:47:12,450 --> 02:47:14,490
Oh, her characters are so heavy-handed."

3967
02:47:14,490 --> 02:47:16,020
You know, she started as a screenwriter.

3968
02:47:16,020 --> 02:47:20,250
She started as someone who analyzed films for movie studios.

3969
02:47:20,250 --> 02:47:23,550
She knew exactly how to manipulate plot

3970
02:47:23,550 --> 02:47:25,470
and character and drama.

3971
02:47:25,470 --> 02:47:27,898
And she also knew that she was writing,

3972
02:47:27,898 --> 02:47:31,260
people say, "Oh, Rand is for adolescents,

3973
02:47:31,260 --> 02:47:32,610
adolescent teenagers love Rand."

3974
02:47:32,610 --> 02:47:34,380
And that's kind of who she was writing for.

3975
02:47:34,380 --> 02:47:35,213
And she said, you know,

3976
02:47:35,213 --> 02:47:37,080
"I'm writing for people as they start out on their life

3977
02:47:37,080 --> 02:47:39,810
and they're thinking about who they want to be."

3978
02:47:39,810 --> 02:47:43,980
So she's not writing for the weary middle age.

3979
02:47:43,980 --> 02:47:46,380
She's writing for the young who are looking for inspiration.

3980
02:47:46,380 --> 02:47:47,940
- You know, people say that to me sometimes

3981
02:47:47,940 --> 02:47:50,310
about certain books like Rand,

3982
02:47:50,310 --> 02:47:52,890
but also about "The Alchemist."

3983
02:47:52,890 --> 02:47:55,860
I know a lot of people for whom "The Alchemist,"

3984
02:47:55,860 --> 02:47:58,087
and they're adults and they're brilliant people,

3985
02:47:58,087 --> 02:48:00,480
"The Alchemist" changed their life.

3986
02:48:00,480 --> 02:48:03,441
And the same can be said about "The Fountainhead."

3987
02:48:03,441 --> 02:48:07,230
I sometimes get criticized

3988
02:48:07,230 --> 02:48:11,040
for using words that are too simple. (chuckles)

3989
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:15,270
I think simple words can have power.

3990
02:48:15,270 --> 02:48:18,630
And the cliche thing sometimes needs to be said.

3991
02:48:18,630 --> 02:48:21,390
And sometimes, if effectively,

3992
02:48:21,390 --> 02:48:24,923
needs to be said in an over the top way

3993
02:48:24,923 --> 02:48:27,450
in the mythic register,

3994
02:48:27,450 --> 02:48:29,370
because that's the thing that resonates with us.

3995
02:48:29,370 --> 02:48:30,203
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

3996
02:48:30,203 --> 02:48:33,030
- Because we are like heroes of our own story.

3997
02:48:33,030 --> 02:48:34,890
We need to hear that message sometimes

3998
02:48:34,890 --> 02:48:36,030
to take the bold step,

3999
02:48:36,030 --> 02:48:38,040
to take the risk, to take the leap.

4000
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:39,720
- Yeah, and I mean, the other thing,

4001
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:42,900
she knew she was doing kind of propaganda in a way.

4002
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:45,210
She was like, "I'm doing pro-capitalist propaganda."

4003
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:47,160
She has a degree from the University of Leningrad.

4004
02:48:47,160 --> 02:48:49,020
You know, she's raised up in Soviet Russia.

4005
02:48:49,020 --> 02:48:51,840
She said, "We need to present the case

4006
02:48:51,840 --> 02:48:54,210
for the other side in the same way."

4007
02:48:54,210 --> 02:48:56,160
And that's what she did.

4008
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:57,900
- Why do you think she's so divisive?

4009
02:48:57,900 --> 02:49:00,600
People either love her or hate her.

4010
02:49:00,600 --> 02:49:03,240
- I mean, I think it's because of that purity,

4011
02:49:03,240 --> 02:49:05,250
that I'm willing to say

4012
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:07,680
sort of you get what you deserve,

4013
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:09,753
and that kind of lack of charity.

4014
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:12,750
And part of that in her work is

4015
02:49:12,750 --> 02:49:14,790
because she creates this fictional world

4016
02:49:14,790 --> 02:49:17,670
where she can set everything up just so,

4017
02:49:17,670 --> 02:49:21,870
and so you don't have contingency

4018
02:49:21,870 --> 02:49:23,910
or accident or bad luck,

4019
02:49:23,910 --> 02:49:26,520
or you don't really have a lot of children,

4020
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:27,640
you don't have handicapped people.

4021
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:30,930
You know, you just have this idealized world.

4022
02:49:30,930 --> 02:49:33,480
And I think it's really infuriating

4023
02:49:33,480 --> 02:49:35,250
for people who feel that's so inaccurate.

4024
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:37,680
How can you be deriving a social theory

4025
02:49:37,680 --> 02:49:39,810
and philosophy around this?

4026
02:49:39,810 --> 02:49:41,910
And how can you be missing what seems

4027
02:49:41,910 --> 02:49:45,510
to many people she's missing the kind of ethical instinct

4028
02:49:45,510 --> 02:49:47,940
or the altruistic or charitable instinct.

4029
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:50,550
And so they just become enraged at that,

4030
02:49:50,550 --> 02:49:53,550
and they don't want to see anyone go that far.

4031
02:49:53,550 --> 02:49:56,130
And they're outraged that someone went that far,

4032
02:49:56,130 --> 02:49:58,780
did the thing that Frank Knight said no one would do.

4033
02:49:59,970 --> 02:50:02,880
Yeah, it's very unsettling.

4034
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:06,420
- Would you say that's her main blind spot?

4035
02:50:06,420 --> 02:50:10,500
The main flaw of Objectivism is just how black

4036
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:12,630
and white it paints the world?

4037
02:50:12,630 --> 02:50:17,630
Or if not, what would you say are the flaws of Objectivism?

4038
02:50:17,790 --> 02:50:20,880
- So I mean, the big flaw is that it's justified

4039
02:50:20,880 --> 02:50:22,500
through a fictional world.

4040
02:50:22,500 --> 02:50:26,220
It's not justified through reference to the real world.

4041
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:27,783
It's not empirical.

4042
02:50:30,990 --> 02:50:32,370
And Rand herself would say that.

4043
02:50:32,370 --> 02:50:35,490
She's not writing about things how they are,

4044
02:50:35,490 --> 02:50:37,080
but how they should be.

4045
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:42,080
And so that idealism just really undermines it

4046
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:47,460
as a mechanism to understand where we're actually living.

4047
02:50:47,460 --> 02:50:50,040
- And that is a big contrast with Milton Friedman,

4048
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:52,350
who would focus on how things are

4049
02:50:52,350 --> 02:50:54,660
versus how things should be.

4050
02:50:54,660 --> 02:50:56,100
- And then I think it's the problem

4051
02:50:56,100 --> 02:50:59,520
of elevating rationality over any other mode

4052
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:01,050
of insight or thinking.

4053
02:51:01,050 --> 02:51:03,180
And so what happens in Rand's life,

4054
02:51:03,180 --> 02:51:05,340
I describe this in some detail in the book,

4055
02:51:05,340 --> 02:51:09,540
is she essentially creates a cult of reason around her

4056
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:13,200
and people who are drawn into this cult,

4057
02:51:13,200 --> 02:51:14,970
it's called the Collective.

4058
02:51:14,970 --> 02:51:16,590
It's a group of young people

4059
02:51:16,590 --> 02:51:19,200
in New York City who are drawn to her work.

4060
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:20,310
And she's already famous,

4061
02:51:20,310 --> 02:51:21,600
but she's writing "Atlas Shrugged"

4062
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:25,020
and so she's sharing drafts of "Atlas Shrugged"

4063
02:51:25,020 --> 02:51:26,400
as she goes along.

4064
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:28,560
And one of the members of the Collective,

4065
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:31,044
to bring all of this together, is Alan Greenspan,

4066
02:51:31,044 --> 02:51:32,670
who will later be head of the Federal Reserve.

4067
02:51:32,670 --> 02:51:34,680
And he's incredibly taken with her.

4068
02:51:34,680 --> 02:51:36,697
He's one of these people who says,

4069
02:51:36,697 --> 02:51:38,490
"I was a narrow, technical thinker.

4070
02:51:38,490 --> 02:51:40,290
I never thought about ethics

4071
02:51:40,290 --> 02:51:42,627
or politics or anything bigger until I met Ayn Rand.

4072
02:51:42,627 --> 02:51:44,460
And she really opened my mind."

4073
02:51:44,460 --> 02:51:46,740
He's part of this tight knit group.

4074
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:48,270
But over time, in this tight knit group,

4075
02:51:48,270 --> 02:51:49,103
they think of themselves,

4076
02:51:49,103 --> 02:51:50,370
we are all individualists.

4077
02:51:50,370 --> 02:51:52,500
We're dedicated to individualism and capitalism.

4078
02:51:52,500 --> 02:51:54,750
We're different than everybody else.

4079
02:51:54,750 --> 02:51:58,380
Over time, they all come to share Ayn Rand's views

4080
02:51:58,380 --> 02:52:03,330
and opinions on everything from music to art to clothes.

4081
02:52:03,330 --> 02:52:05,130
You know, she gets a dining room table

4082
02:52:05,130 --> 02:52:08,010
and a bunch of them get the same dining room table.

4083
02:52:08,010 --> 02:52:10,890
And it becomes incredibly conformist,

4084
02:52:10,890 --> 02:52:15,030
because they've all believed they're acting rationally.

4085
02:52:15,030 --> 02:52:16,770
And they believe that to act rationally

4086
02:52:16,770 --> 02:52:18,240
is to agree with Ayn Rand.

4087
02:52:18,240 --> 02:52:20,670
And they believe there's no other way

4088
02:52:20,670 --> 02:52:23,370
to make decisions than rationality.

4089
02:52:23,370 --> 02:52:26,310
And so to disagree with her is to be irrational.

4090
02:52:26,310 --> 02:52:27,390
They don't want to be irrational.

4091
02:52:27,390 --> 02:52:29,700
So people get really caught up

4092
02:52:29,700 --> 02:52:33,780
in this very damaging cult-like circle around her.

4093
02:52:33,780 --> 02:52:37,830
- Plus, for a cult of reason,

4094
02:52:37,830 --> 02:52:39,180
they get awfully emotional

4095
02:52:39,180 --> 02:52:42,150
when there's any disagreement with Ayn Rand. (chuckles)

4096
02:52:42,150 --> 02:52:44,760
I mean, it's kind of hilarious.

4097
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:46,383
It's absurd, but it's,

4098
02:52:48,480 --> 02:52:52,140
I mean, it's also beautiful to watch this singular figure.

4099
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:54,420
We've talked about several singular figures,

4100
02:52:54,420 --> 02:52:56,130
like Frank Wright,

4101
02:52:56,130 --> 02:52:59,690
that shakes up the world with her ideas.

4102
02:52:59,690 --> 02:53:00,523
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

4103
02:53:00,523 --> 02:53:02,100
- And of course it would form a cult.

4104
02:53:02,100 --> 02:53:04,500
And of course that cult would be full of contradictions

4105
02:53:04,500 --> 02:53:06,071
and hypocrisies.

4106
02:53:06,071 --> 02:53:07,612
- Yeah, I mean, it's amazing.

4107
02:53:07,612 --> 02:53:10,020
So Murray Rothbard, who's a famous anarchist,

4108
02:53:10,020 --> 02:53:12,240
falls into the Ayn Rand cult,

4109
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:15,300
and then he disagrees,

4110
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:17,730
and there's some type of show trial

4111
02:53:17,730 --> 02:53:20,220
where he's told he's wrong about everything.

4112
02:53:20,220 --> 02:53:23,250
And then he has a little sort of pseudo cult of his own,

4113
02:53:23,250 --> 02:53:26,880
and two of his cult members switch over to Ayn Rand,

4114
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:29,613
and then one of them, to show,

4115
02:53:30,870 --> 02:53:33,390
to gesture their breaking of their relationship,

4116
02:53:33,390 --> 02:53:36,930
mails him a dollar bill that's been torn in half.

4117
02:53:36,930 --> 02:53:41,040
I mean, this is high theatrics, right? (laughs)

4118
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:44,460
- Okay, sticking on the drama and the theatrics,

4119
02:53:44,460 --> 02:53:46,229
who was Nathaniel Branden?

4120
02:53:46,229 --> 02:53:47,062
- Oh, yes.

4121
02:53:47,062 --> 02:53:48,840
- Can you take me through the arc

4122
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:51,600
of Ayn Rand's relationship with Nathaniel Branden

4123
02:53:51,600 --> 02:53:54,240
to their dramatic falling out in 1968?

4124
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:55,073
- Yes.

4125
02:53:55,073 --> 02:53:57,207
So after "The Fountainhead,"

4126
02:53:58,207 --> 02:53:59,730
"The Fountainhead" is auctioned,

4127
02:53:59,730 --> 02:54:00,870
is sold to be a film.

4128
02:54:00,870 --> 02:54:02,880
So Ayn Rand moves to Hollywood,

4129
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:04,560
where she's going to help in the writing the film.

4130
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:06,690
She wants a lot of creative control.

4131
02:54:06,690 --> 02:54:08,670
And then she's also still working in screenwriting

4132
02:54:08,670 --> 02:54:09,503
and things like this.

4133
02:54:09,503 --> 02:54:12,590
And so she gets a letter from,

4134
02:54:12,590 --> 02:54:14,310
there's a Canadian student who's written

4135
02:54:14,310 --> 02:54:16,920
to her several times, and then he writes again,

4136
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:18,540
and he says, "I'm at UCLA."

4137
02:54:18,540 --> 02:54:20,550
And she's like, "Young man, you're so full of error.

4138
02:54:20,550 --> 02:54:22,350
Why don't you come visit me,

4139
02:54:22,350 --> 02:54:23,640
and I'll straighten you out?"

4140
02:54:23,640 --> 02:54:26,460
So he comes, and they have this real meeting of the minds.

4141
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:27,930
They talk all night.

4142
02:54:27,930 --> 02:54:28,763
He comes again.

4143
02:54:28,763 --> 02:54:29,730
He brings his girlfriend.

4144
02:54:29,730 --> 02:54:31,050
She loves him.

4145
02:54:31,050 --> 02:54:34,200
And they start this very intense relationship

4146
02:54:34,200 --> 02:54:36,750
of spending every weekend at her house,

4147
02:54:36,750 --> 02:54:39,000
basically, staying up all night talking about ideas.

4148
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:40,470
He becomes completely converted

4149
02:54:40,470 --> 02:54:41,973
to the Objectivist worldview.

4150
02:54:43,230 --> 02:54:44,487
Rand begins counseling him

4151
02:54:44,487 --> 02:54:47,070
and his girlfriend about their relationship.

4152
02:54:47,070 --> 02:54:49,260
You know, very intense thing.

4153
02:54:49,260 --> 02:54:51,270
Then eventually they graduate from college

4154
02:54:51,270 --> 02:54:54,090
and they both enroll in a graduate program in Columbia,

4155
02:54:54,090 --> 02:54:55,530
and they leave.

4156
02:54:55,530 --> 02:54:59,400
And after they've left, Ayn Rand is just bereft.

4157
02:54:59,400 --> 02:55:01,140
And within a few months,

4158
02:55:01,140 --> 02:55:03,233
she packs up her home and she moves to New York.

4159
02:55:03,233 --> 02:55:05,430
Here I am, I like New York better.

4160
02:55:05,430 --> 02:55:07,770
And so that becomes the seedbed of the Collective.

4161
02:55:07,770 --> 02:55:10,380
And the Brandens, they get married.

4162
02:55:10,380 --> 02:55:12,570
They change their name to Branden.

4163
02:55:12,570 --> 02:55:15,960
They've never publicly spoken on this,

4164
02:55:15,960 --> 02:55:19,080
but many people have pointed out it has the word Rand

4165
02:55:19,080 --> 02:55:21,480
in the name, so it's some type

4166
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:24,630
of acknowledgment of how important she is to them.

4167
02:55:24,630 --> 02:55:26,220
And time goes on,

4168
02:55:26,220 --> 02:55:29,490
and romantic feelings develop between Ayn Rand

4169
02:55:29,490 --> 02:55:30,330
and Nathaniel Branden,

4170
02:55:30,330 --> 02:55:31,920
who's some 20 years her junior.

4171
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:34,380
And they discuss them,

4172
02:55:34,380 --> 02:55:37,260
and they realize that rationality has led them

4173
02:55:37,260 --> 02:55:39,284
to the conclusion that they should be lovers.

4174
02:55:39,284 --> 02:55:40,117
- [Lex] Right.

4175
02:55:40,117 --> 02:55:42,000
- Right, they've rationally decided this,

4176
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,530
but because they're rational,

4177
02:55:43,530 --> 02:55:45,510
they need the consent,

4178
02:55:45,510 --> 02:55:47,388
or at least to inform their partners.

4179
02:55:47,388 --> 02:55:48,244
- They're both married.

4180
02:55:48,244 --> 02:55:49,200
- They're both married.

4181
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:53,640
So they call a meeting and they obtain the consent,

4182
02:55:53,640 --> 02:55:56,330
or maybe simply inform the others

4183
02:55:56,330 --> 02:55:58,140
of the rationality of the choice.

4184
02:55:58,140 --> 02:55:58,973
And then they say,

4185
02:55:58,973 --> 02:56:02,640
"But this is only going to be an intellectual relationship,

4186
02:56:02,640 --> 02:56:04,890
but we'd like a few hours alone each week,

4187
02:56:04,890 --> 02:56:06,360
and we don't want to be deceptive,

4188
02:56:06,360 --> 02:56:08,220
so we want you to know and approve of this."

4189
02:56:08,220 --> 02:56:10,680
So the spouses bought into rationality,

4190
02:56:10,680 --> 02:56:12,186
know and approve.

4191
02:56:12,186 --> 02:56:13,980
One thing leads to another.

4192
02:56:13,980 --> 02:56:17,370
It becomes a full romantic and sexual relationship.

4193
02:56:17,370 --> 02:56:19,070
And although it's open within these four people,

4194
02:56:19,070 --> 02:56:21,360
it is not open more broadly.

4195
02:56:21,360 --> 02:56:24,090
And so in all these meetings of the Collective,

4196
02:56:24,090 --> 02:56:26,670
got Alan Greenspan and all these other people coming up,

4197
02:56:26,670 --> 02:56:29,310
you know, drinking coffee all night, talking, talking.

4198
02:56:29,310 --> 02:56:31,020
They all know that Nathaniel Branden

4199
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:32,700
is Objectivist number one.

4200
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:35,220
They don't know that there's a romantic

4201
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:36,690
and sexual relationship happening.

4202
02:56:36,690 --> 02:56:37,590
It's kept a secret.

4203
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:40,590
And then when "Atlas Shrugged" comes out,

4204
02:56:40,590 --> 02:56:42,300
it's panned by reviewers.

4205
02:56:42,300 --> 02:56:44,220
People absolutely hate this book.

4206
02:56:44,220 --> 02:56:46,860
And Rand is not Howard Roark.

4207
02:56:46,860 --> 02:56:48,600
She falls into a deep depression,

4208
02:56:48,600 --> 02:56:51,360
because her masterpiece has been rejected.

4209
02:56:51,360 --> 02:56:55,200
And so then, the romantic relationship ends,

4210
02:56:55,200 --> 02:56:58,260
but the close personal relationship continues.

4211
02:56:58,260 --> 02:56:59,970
And then over time, Branden,

4212
02:56:59,970 --> 02:57:02,400
who's still married to his wife,

4213
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:05,280
begins an affair with another young woman.

4214
02:57:05,280 --> 02:57:06,113
And at this point,

4215
02:57:06,113 --> 02:57:08,940
he has started the Nathaniel Branden Institute

4216
02:57:08,940 --> 02:57:10,800
to teach Objectivism.

4217
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:12,480
And he's making good money.

4218
02:57:12,480 --> 02:57:13,784
He's becoming quite famous.

4219
02:57:13,784 --> 02:57:15,016
- She supported the institute.

4220
02:57:15,016 --> 02:57:15,849
- She supported it,

4221
02:57:15,849 --> 02:57:18,690
and at first it was to help her in her depression

4222
02:57:18,690 --> 02:57:21,750
because he said, "The world needs to recognize your genius.

4223
02:57:21,750 --> 02:57:24,000
They missed 'Atlas Shrugged,' but I'm going to teach them.

4224
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:25,560
I will bring the message."

4225
02:57:25,560 --> 02:57:26,910
And it's very successful.

4226
02:57:26,910 --> 02:57:28,050
It becomes its own business.

4227
02:57:28,050 --> 02:57:28,980
It has a newsletter.

4228
02:57:28,980 --> 02:57:29,940
It's a whole world.

4229
02:57:29,940 --> 02:57:31,500
So that small cult

4230
02:57:31,500 --> 02:57:33,930
around Ayn Rand expands to this whole social network.

4231
02:57:33,930 --> 02:57:35,520
And it's very much a piece

4232
02:57:35,520 --> 02:57:37,500
with this burgeoning conservative movement.

4233
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:40,833
Objectivists are involved in criticizing the draft.

4234
02:57:42,570 --> 02:57:45,930
There it's kind of a libertarian Objectivist world going on.

4235
02:57:45,930 --> 02:57:47,150
All of this is happening.

4236
02:57:47,150 --> 02:57:48,030
In the meantime,

4237
02:57:48,030 --> 02:57:50,084
Nathaniel Branden has found a new partner.

4238
02:57:50,084 --> 02:57:52,050
But he doesn't tell Ayn Rand this,

4239
02:57:52,050 --> 02:57:53,790
because he knows she'll be upset.

4240
02:57:53,790 --> 02:57:57,100
And so it goes on for years.

4241
02:57:57,100 --> 02:58:02,100
And Ayn Rand knows something is going on,

4242
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:03,690
but she can't quite figure it out.

4243
02:58:03,690 --> 02:58:07,650
And then finally Barbara Branden says to Nathaniel Branden,

4244
02:58:07,650 --> 02:58:09,750
you know, "You have to tell her.

4245
02:58:09,750 --> 02:58:11,700
This has just gone on too long."

4246
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:14,580
So she finds out, and the whole thing blows up,

4247
02:58:14,580 --> 02:58:16,050
and she exiles him,

4248
02:58:16,050 --> 02:58:18,540
and she breaks off contact with him,

4249
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:21,180
and nobody is ever told what happens.

4250
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:22,680
It's called the Objectivist schism.

4251
02:58:22,680 --> 02:58:24,210
You know, Objectivism breaks in two,

4252
02:58:24,210 --> 02:58:25,593
because some people say,

4253
02:58:27,157 --> 02:58:28,890
"How could Ayn Rand do anything wrong?"

4254
02:58:28,890 --> 02:58:30,517
And other people say,

4255
02:58:30,517 --> 02:58:32,160
"What is this letter all about?

4256
02:58:32,160 --> 02:58:33,690
And what did Nathaniel Branden do?

4257
02:58:33,690 --> 02:58:35,220
And I'm not just going to take her word for it.

4258
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:36,360
I need more information."

4259
02:58:36,360 --> 02:58:38,610
And then a bunch of people,

4260
02:58:38,610 --> 02:58:40,080
I've read all the accounts of this.

4261
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:40,913
A bunch of people are like,

4262
02:58:40,913 --> 02:58:42,900
"Okay, they were having an affair."

4263
02:58:42,900 --> 02:58:44,227
And a bunch of other people are like,

4264
02:58:44,227 --> 02:58:45,960
"No, that couldn't possibly be happening."

4265
02:58:45,960 --> 02:58:48,191
You know, and so, (chuckles)

4266
02:58:48,191 --> 02:58:49,800
the whole thing breaks up.

4267
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:51,330
But what I argue in my book

4268
02:58:51,330 --> 02:58:53,070
is actually this is to the benefit

4269
02:58:53,070 --> 02:58:56,220
of Rand's ideas, because Rand herself was

4270
02:58:56,220 --> 02:58:58,650
so controlling over her ideas.

4271
02:58:58,650 --> 02:59:02,820
And now that she steps back from a public role, you know,

4272
02:59:02,820 --> 02:59:06,150
Objectivism flows into the student libertarian movement.

4273
02:59:06,150 --> 02:59:08,160
Some Objectivists become conservatives.

4274
02:59:08,160 --> 02:59:10,500
It just kind of spreads out more generally.

4275
02:59:10,500 --> 02:59:13,110
And you don't have to drink the Kool Aid,

4276
02:59:13,110 --> 02:59:14,940
you don't have to take the official course.

4277
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:16,380
Nathaniel Branden goes on to be part

4278
02:59:16,380 --> 02:59:18,660
of the self-esteem movement, you know,

4279
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:20,763
human potential movement, California.

4280
02:59:21,660 --> 02:59:24,750
And Ayn Rand lives another 10 years or so,

4281
02:59:24,750 --> 02:59:27,510
but she doesn't do major work after that.

4282
02:59:27,510 --> 02:59:30,573
- So since we were talking about some of the,

4283
02:59:32,460 --> 02:59:34,260
although rationalized,

4284
02:59:34,260 --> 02:59:36,840
some strange sexual partnerships

4285
02:59:36,840 --> 02:59:39,540
that they were engaging in,

4286
02:59:39,540 --> 02:59:41,430
I have to ask about "The Fountainhead"

4287
02:59:41,430 --> 02:59:43,590
and the, quote unquote, "rape scene"

4288
02:59:43,590 --> 02:59:45,330
in "The Fountainhead."

4289
02:59:45,330 --> 02:59:50,130
Was she intending to add that there to be controversial?

4290
02:59:50,130 --> 02:59:52,590
How are we supposed to read into it?

4291
02:59:52,590 --> 02:59:55,740
Is it a glimpse into Ayn Rand's sexuality?

4292
02:59:55,740 --> 02:59:58,350
And maybe broadly we can say,

4293
02:59:58,350 --> 02:59:59,943
what was her view on this,

4294
03:00:00,810 --> 03:00:04,350
on sexuality, on sex, on power dynamics and relationships?

4295
03:00:04,350 --> 03:00:06,780
- Yeah, I mean, there's also an Objectivist theory

4296
03:00:06,780 --> 03:00:10,410
of sexuality that probably the least convincing

4297
03:00:10,410 --> 03:00:12,240
of all the parts of Objectivism.

4298
03:00:12,240 --> 03:00:14,190
And it goes something like,

4299
03:00:14,190 --> 03:00:19,067
your sexual desires express your highest values,

4300
03:00:20,160 --> 03:00:23,700
and they are related in some ways to your rationality,

4301
03:00:23,700 --> 03:00:25,586
which is also related to your highest value.

4302
03:00:25,586 --> 03:00:29,940
So for her, that explained her attraction

4303
03:00:29,940 --> 03:00:30,810
to Nathaniel Branden,

4304
03:00:30,810 --> 03:00:33,690
and Nathaniel Branden's attraction to her was a function

4305
03:00:33,690 --> 03:00:35,760
of their highest values.

4306
03:00:35,760 --> 03:00:37,380
And in fact, Branden imbibed this

4307
03:00:37,380 --> 03:00:40,590
so deeply that the fact that he was later drawn sexually

4308
03:00:40,590 --> 03:00:43,143
to a woman who was not particularly accomplished,

4309
03:00:44,010 --> 03:00:47,280
but was beautiful caused him deep anguish

4310
03:00:47,280 --> 03:00:49,410
and guilt for being non-Objectivist.

4311
03:00:49,410 --> 03:00:51,750
So this is the Objectivist theory.

4312
03:00:51,750 --> 03:00:55,155
Then, the gender politics are just crazy,

4313
03:00:55,155 --> 03:00:56,550
and we have to kind of back up and think,

4314
03:00:56,550 --> 03:00:58,440
okay, so who is Ayn Rand?

4315
03:00:58,440 --> 03:01:00,453
She's born Alisa Rosenbaum in Russia.

4316
03:01:01,290 --> 03:01:03,330
She is someone who stands out

4317
03:01:03,330 --> 03:01:04,590
from the crowd from the beginning.

4318
03:01:04,590 --> 03:01:06,720
She never really fits in.

4319
03:01:06,720 --> 03:01:08,550
She's not conventionally beautiful

4320
03:01:08,550 --> 03:01:10,080
by any stretch of the imagination.

4321
03:01:10,080 --> 03:01:11,430
She struggles with her weight,

4322
03:01:11,430 --> 03:01:14,760
and she doesn't consider herself to have a beautiful face.

4323
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:16,740
She's very independent.

4324
03:01:16,740 --> 03:01:18,570
She meets none of the metrics

4325
03:01:18,570 --> 03:01:20,700
of traditional femininity at all.

4326
03:01:20,700 --> 03:01:23,670
She finds love with a man who is very handsome

4327
03:01:23,670 --> 03:01:24,873
but very passive.

4328
03:01:25,950 --> 03:01:27,900
Yet she writes in all her fiction

4329
03:01:27,900 --> 03:01:30,090
about strong, manly heroes.

4330
03:01:30,090 --> 03:01:32,520
So this seems to be like a projection.

4331
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:35,670
The man she's actually with is not a strong, manly hero.

4332
03:01:35,670 --> 03:01:37,080
The hero she writes about,

4333
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:38,190
she probably wouldn't be able to be

4334
03:01:38,190 --> 03:01:40,050
in the same room with them for more than one minute

4335
03:01:40,050 --> 03:01:42,521
before they got in a raging argument, right?

4336
03:01:42,521 --> 03:01:43,354
(Lex chuckles)

4337
03:01:43,354 --> 03:01:46,470
And then she develops this theory about women

4338
03:01:46,470 --> 03:01:51,470
and men in that a woman should worship her man,

4339
03:01:51,540 --> 03:01:54,660
and a woman finds her true expression

4340
03:01:54,660 --> 03:01:56,790
in worshiping the man she's with.

4341
03:01:56,790 --> 03:01:59,700
So, again, this is not at all how Ayn Rand lives her life.

4342
03:01:59,700 --> 03:02:01,680
This is like this,

4343
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:04,020
I would say, compensatory theory

4344
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:05,940
for her lack of ability

4345
03:02:05,940 --> 03:02:08,970
to conform to the gender norms of her day.

4346
03:02:08,970 --> 03:02:13,320
She then articulates them in a very strong

4347
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:16,860
and almost distorted and exaggerated way to compensate

4348
03:02:16,860 --> 03:02:18,810
for the fact that she doesn't actually meet them,

4349
03:02:18,810 --> 03:02:20,193
can't actually enact them.

4350
03:02:21,360 --> 03:02:23,340
The rape scene, to some degree,

4351
03:02:23,340 --> 03:02:27,990
embodies that idea that, to some degree,

4352
03:02:27,990 --> 03:02:30,150
that the woman should worship the man.

4353
03:02:30,150 --> 03:02:33,630
I tend to read it more in terms of literary genre.

4354
03:02:33,630 --> 03:02:37,140
So Rand is a screenwriter,

4355
03:02:37,140 --> 03:02:40,620
you know, a consumer of movies.

4356
03:02:40,620 --> 03:02:44,280
And that rape scene is paradigmatic

4357
03:02:44,280 --> 03:02:46,500
for the romance genre.

4358
03:02:46,500 --> 03:02:49,470
In other words, these like pulpy romance novels,

4359
03:02:49,470 --> 03:02:51,060
- Mhm, (chuckles) yeah.

4360
03:02:51,060 --> 03:02:52,710
- The hero rapes the heroine,

4361
03:02:52,710 --> 03:02:53,670
and then they fall in love.

4362
03:02:53,670 --> 03:02:55,710
That's just the trope of how it works.

4363
03:02:55,710 --> 03:02:57,570
So it's crazy when you read it,

4364
03:02:57,570 --> 03:03:00,630
but if you were reading a bunch of novels in this genre,

4365
03:03:00,630 --> 03:03:03,750
you would find this is very standard.

4366
03:03:03,750 --> 03:03:07,230
And so that is a huge part of its appeal at the time.

4367
03:03:07,230 --> 03:03:11,130
There's this feminist who hates Rand, Susan Brownmiller,

4368
03:03:11,130 --> 03:03:13,560
and she wants to write an angry denunciation

4369
03:03:13,560 --> 03:03:14,430
of the rape scene.

4370
03:03:14,430 --> 03:03:15,960
So she goes to get "The Fountainhead."

4371
03:03:15,960 --> 03:03:18,300
And she's wondering how is she ever gonna find the scene

4372
03:03:18,300 --> 03:03:20,640
in this, you know, 800-page book?

4373
03:03:20,640 --> 03:03:22,557
It's a library copy, because she doesn't wanna buy it.

4374
03:03:22,557 --> 03:03:25,590
And it just falls open to the rape scene,

4375
03:03:25,590 --> 03:03:27,090
because everybody's gone and read it,

4376
03:03:27,090 --> 03:03:28,500
because it's very racy

4377
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:30,360
and explicit for that time.

4378
03:03:30,360 --> 03:03:33,540
So I'm almost positive she also knew that.

4379
03:03:33,540 --> 03:03:37,140
Like if I put in this kind of taboo-breaking sex scene,

4380
03:03:37,140 --> 03:03:38,580
that's also gonna probably be

4381
03:03:38,580 --> 03:03:40,020
why people tell their friends about it.

4382
03:03:40,020 --> 03:03:42,300
So I just, I think it's a mess.

4383
03:03:42,300 --> 03:03:44,340
I think all of the gender

4384
03:03:44,340 --> 03:03:48,330
and sexuality stuff she states

4385
03:03:48,330 --> 03:03:49,920
is just a total mess.

4386
03:03:49,920 --> 03:03:53,700
- I think it also reminds me of another guy related,

4387
03:03:53,700 --> 03:03:55,260
Friedrich Nietzsche,

4388
03:03:55,260 --> 03:03:58,140
who had very strong opinions on women

4389
03:03:58,140 --> 03:04:02,547
and wrote about what women's role in society should be

4390
03:04:02,547 --> 03:04:04,500
and different power dynamics

4391
03:04:04,500 --> 03:04:05,940
and relationships and all that kind of stuff,

4392
03:04:05,940 --> 03:04:09,004
when he himself really had trouble getting laid.

4393
03:04:09,004 --> 03:04:09,837
- Yeah.

4394
03:04:09,837 --> 03:04:14,250
- (chuckles) And so he has to sort of always maybe chuckle

4395
03:04:14,250 --> 03:04:18,510
or take with a grain of salt the analysis of power dynamics

4396
03:04:18,510 --> 03:04:19,860
in relationship from these figures,

4397
03:04:19,860 --> 03:04:24,663
which failed in many regards in their own private life.

4398
03:04:26,760 --> 03:04:27,870
You mentioned feminists.

4399
03:04:27,870 --> 03:04:30,600
Would you consider Ayn Rand a feminist?

4400
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:32,673
- I mean, she's almost an anti-feminist,

4401
03:04:33,960 --> 03:04:35,490
because she then goes on,

4402
03:04:35,490 --> 03:04:40,490
and someone writes her a letter about like,

4403
03:04:41,460 --> 03:04:43,230
should there be a female president or something.

4404
03:04:43,230 --> 03:04:44,760
This is like the beginning of feminism.

4405
03:04:44,760 --> 03:04:48,063
And she says, "No.

4406
03:04:49,110 --> 03:04:50,700
No woman should ever be president,

4407
03:04:50,700 --> 03:04:53,190
because if she's president,

4408
03:04:53,190 --> 03:04:55,530
she wouldn't be able to look up to any man,

4409
03:04:55,530 --> 03:04:56,910
because she would be so powerful,

4410
03:04:56,910 --> 03:04:58,470
and therefore she would be like corrupt

4411
03:04:58,470 --> 03:04:59,910
and rotten in the soul

4412
03:04:59,910 --> 03:05:01,350
and unfit to be a leader."

4413
03:05:01,350 --> 03:05:04,227
And it just makes no sense.

4414
03:05:04,227 --> 03:05:05,617
- But that said, she's a woman,

4415
03:05:05,617 --> 03:05:07,590
and she's one of the most powerful intellects

4416
03:05:07,590 --> 03:05:08,880
in the 20th century.

4417
03:05:08,880 --> 03:05:09,713
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

4418
03:05:09,713 --> 03:05:12,210
- And so it's the contradictions.

4419
03:05:12,210 --> 03:05:15,630
I mean, Nietzsche is full of contradictions of this sort.

4420
03:05:15,630 --> 03:05:20,630
That the very fact that she's one of the most powerful minds

4421
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:27,183
in history to me means that she is a feminist in her,

4422
03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:29,843
in the spirit she embodies, right?

4423
03:05:29,843 --> 03:05:31,350
In what she represents.

4424
03:05:31,350 --> 03:05:34,590
- I mean, she lived the ideals of individualism in her life

4425
03:05:34,590 --> 03:05:37,020
and set aside gender norms in her own life,

4426
03:05:37,020 --> 03:05:39,870
but she did not see herself as part of any,

4427
03:05:39,870 --> 03:05:41,790
she did not see herself as doing this

4428
03:05:41,790 --> 03:05:43,530
for the benefit of other women

4429
03:05:43,530 --> 03:05:46,680
or to change society's views about women.

4430
03:05:46,680 --> 03:05:48,510
There was no collective essence to it.

4431
03:05:48,510 --> 03:05:53,407
So if feminism has some sort of collective aspect to it,

4432
03:05:54,960 --> 03:05:57,540
or at least some identification,

4433
03:05:57,540 --> 03:06:00,240
one needs to identify with a broader category of women

4434
03:06:00,240 --> 03:06:01,920
and feel they're acting on behalf of that,

4435
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:03,870
she's definitely not doing that.

4436
03:06:03,870 --> 03:06:06,750
And she did, you know,

4437
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:10,230
she was fair to women in her life,

4438
03:06:10,230 --> 03:06:12,270
promoted them in her life, but did not,

4439
03:06:12,270 --> 03:06:14,970
I mean, she was very negative about feminism.

4440
03:06:14,970 --> 03:06:18,120
And then, because they dress terribly, you know?

4441
03:06:18,120 --> 03:06:20,190
And then the other thing, it's really interesting,

4442
03:06:20,190 --> 03:06:24,300
there's all these kind of homoerotic themes in her writing.

4443
03:06:24,300 --> 03:06:28,980
And for that reason, many gay men were drawn to her writing.

4444
03:06:28,980 --> 03:06:29,947
And then she would say, like,

4445
03:06:29,947 --> 03:06:32,100
"Homosexuals are dirty, terrible people."

4446
03:06:32,100 --> 03:06:34,830
You know, she would denounce people for being homosexual.

4447
03:06:34,830 --> 03:06:36,240
So there's a whole actual literature

4448
03:06:36,240 --> 03:06:39,300
of gay men wrestling with Rand

4449
03:06:39,300 --> 03:06:42,150
and what she says about gay people.

4450
03:06:42,150 --> 03:06:45,750
So, yeah, it's hard to make sense of.

4451
03:06:45,750 --> 03:06:49,260
And I just think of the enormous pressures.

4452
03:06:49,260 --> 03:06:50,100
I want to be charitable,

4453
03:06:50,100 --> 03:06:52,650
I just think of the enormous pressures she was under

4454
03:06:52,650 --> 03:06:54,030
in the culture she was raised in,

4455
03:06:54,030 --> 03:06:56,220
the expectations that were placed upon her,

4456
03:06:56,220 --> 03:06:59,100
and her just utter inability to meet any of them.

4457
03:06:59,100 --> 03:07:02,610
And it came out in this very tortured set of ideals

4458
03:07:02,610 --> 03:07:03,993
that she tried to promote,

4459
03:07:05,940 --> 03:07:09,510
and this kind of lack of ability to introspect in herself

4460
03:07:09,510 --> 03:07:12,960
was probably too painful to introspect

4461
03:07:12,960 --> 03:07:13,920
and to think about that,

4462
03:07:13,920 --> 03:07:18,360
so she just tried to rationalize her way through it,

4463
03:07:18,360 --> 03:07:21,420
and it came out in these very strange theories.

4464
03:07:21,420 --> 03:07:24,300
- Why do you think that Ayn Rand is,

4465
03:07:24,300 --> 03:07:27,180
maybe you can correct me, but as far as I can see,

4466
03:07:27,180 --> 03:07:29,850
never mentioned in the list of great thinkers in history,

4467
03:07:29,850 --> 03:07:32,310
or even the great thinkers of the 20th century,

4468
03:07:32,310 --> 03:07:36,090
or even the great female thinkers of the 20th century?

4469
03:07:36,090 --> 03:07:39,843
So you have somebody like Simone de Beauvoir, Hannah Arendt.

4470
03:07:41,070 --> 03:07:42,930
I almost never see her in the list.

4471
03:07:42,930 --> 03:07:47,930
If you Google those silly lists, top whatever. (chuckles)

4472
03:07:48,270 --> 03:07:50,940
Top thinkers of the 20th century, she's not mentioned.

4473
03:07:50,940 --> 03:07:52,470
Why is that?

4474
03:07:52,470 --> 03:07:54,990
- A lot of people just deeply dislike Rand.

4475
03:07:54,990 --> 03:07:56,700
They deeply dislike her ideas.

4476
03:07:56,700 --> 03:07:58,650
They don't think they're profound,

4477
03:07:58,650 --> 03:08:02,340
because they're disconnection from other ideas

4478
03:08:02,340 --> 03:08:04,560
and other understandings of human society.

4479
03:08:04,560 --> 03:08:07,803
I think where you could look at them and say,

4480
03:08:09,157 --> 03:08:10,860
"These ideas are very provocative,

4481
03:08:10,860 --> 03:08:11,730
and they're very deep,

4482
03:08:11,730 --> 03:08:13,890
because she's not taking anything for granted,

4483
03:08:13,890 --> 03:08:15,510
and she's flipping everything around

4484
03:08:15,510 --> 03:08:17,640
and forcing you to really think."

4485
03:08:17,640 --> 03:08:20,130
To a lot of other readers, to her critics,

4486
03:08:20,130 --> 03:08:21,630
they just look absurd.

4487
03:08:21,630 --> 03:08:24,063
Like, how could you even make these contentions?

4488
03:08:25,350 --> 03:08:29,670
And I think that because she's not without precedence

4489
03:08:29,670 --> 03:08:31,050
and she's not without followers,

4490
03:08:31,050 --> 03:08:33,360
but she doesn't knit herself

4491
03:08:33,360 --> 03:08:35,140
into an intellectual community

4492
03:08:37,110 --> 03:08:40,083
the way that these other thinkers do very naturally.

4493
03:08:41,070 --> 03:08:42,750
You can see who they influence.

4494
03:08:42,750 --> 03:08:45,510
You can see who they're in dialogue with.

4495
03:08:45,510 --> 03:08:48,690
I think my book was one of the first to really take Rand

4496
03:08:48,690 --> 03:08:50,790
and say, "She's a figure in American history.

4497
03:08:50,790 --> 03:08:52,320
Here's who she's connected to.

4498
03:08:52,320 --> 03:08:54,330
Here's who she's influenced."

4499
03:08:54,330 --> 03:08:56,400
And I got a lot of pushback for that.

4500
03:08:56,400 --> 03:09:00,210
You know, I think now people are more open to it.

4501
03:09:00,210 --> 03:09:01,050
But I think the people

4502
03:09:01,050 --> 03:09:05,010
who compile these lists really dislike her work,

4503
03:09:05,010 --> 03:09:06,480
and they think it's shallow

4504
03:09:06,480 --> 03:09:10,830
because they find her fiction overdrawn.

4505
03:09:10,830 --> 03:09:13,980
They find her work in the mythic register simple.

4506
03:09:13,980 --> 03:09:17,610
And she's also a grand systematic thinker

4507
03:09:17,610 --> 03:09:20,100
in an age that's over systems, you know?

4508
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:23,340
She's almost, she's creating an inverse Marxism.

4509
03:09:23,340 --> 03:09:25,770
Marx was writing in 1848, you know,

4510
03:09:25,770 --> 03:09:28,500
he's not a thinker of the mid-20th century.

4511
03:09:28,500 --> 03:09:31,050
So I think that's part of it.

4512
03:09:31,050 --> 03:09:32,250
The lack of a legacy

4513
03:09:32,250 --> 03:09:34,290
and the dislike of what she had to say

4514
03:09:34,290 --> 03:09:36,810
and the feeling that she's too detached.

4515
03:09:36,810 --> 03:09:40,080
Her insights are not insights because they're too idealized,

4516
03:09:40,080 --> 03:09:41,370
rather than being rooted

4517
03:09:41,370 --> 03:09:44,853
in a theory of human nature that people find plausible.

4518
03:09:47,910 --> 03:09:51,270
- You study and write about history of ideas

4519
03:09:51,270 --> 03:09:52,470
in the United States

4520
03:09:52,470 --> 03:09:54,670
over the past hundred years, 100 plus years.

4521
03:09:56,130 --> 03:09:58,290
Well, how do you think ideas evolve

4522
03:09:58,290 --> 03:10:01,290
and gain power over the populace,

4523
03:10:01,290 --> 03:10:04,740
over our government, over culture?

4524
03:10:04,740 --> 03:10:07,620
Just looking at evolution of ideas as they dance

4525
03:10:07,620 --> 03:10:12,620
and challenge each other and play in public discourse,

4526
03:10:14,730 --> 03:10:17,670
what do you think is the mechanism by which they take hold

4527
03:10:17,670 --> 03:10:18,883
and have influence?

4528
03:10:18,883 --> 03:10:19,740
- Yeah, I mean,

4529
03:10:19,740 --> 03:10:24,240
there's a couple different ways I think it happens.

4530
03:10:24,240 --> 03:10:27,630
I really am interested in the relationship

4531
03:10:27,630 --> 03:10:31,440
between the thinker and then the reader

4532
03:10:31,440 --> 03:10:34,050
and the interpreter of the ideas,

4533
03:10:34,050 --> 03:10:35,640
and then the conditions

4534
03:10:35,640 --> 03:10:39,333
on the ground that make that idea resonate or not resonate.

4535
03:10:40,980 --> 03:10:44,100
And so I think a lot,

4536
03:10:44,100 --> 03:10:47,280
so as an intellectual historian, I'm studying ideas.

4537
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:49,320
I'm always putting them in their historical context,

4538
03:10:49,320 --> 03:10:50,153
like what is happening

4539
03:10:50,153 --> 03:10:52,380
that is making these things resonate,

4540
03:10:52,380 --> 03:10:55,173
that is making people seek them out.

4541
03:10:56,040 --> 03:10:59,100
So for Rand's case, she has this credibility

4542
03:10:59,100 --> 03:11:01,200
because of her experience of communism,

4543
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:04,800
which is one of these defining moments of the time.

4544
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:08,100
And then I think the idea comes out in a sort of pure form,

4545
03:11:08,100 --> 03:11:10,020
and then other people rework it

4546
03:11:10,020 --> 03:11:11,910
and reshape it as they read it.

4547
03:11:11,910 --> 03:11:14,400
And I'm really interested in how people form communities

4548
03:11:14,400 --> 03:11:15,360
around these ideas.

4549
03:11:15,360 --> 03:11:19,290
So a bunch of people started calling themselves Objectivists

4550
03:11:19,290 --> 03:11:22,200
and getting together to read Rand's work.

4551
03:11:22,200 --> 03:11:24,960
That was spontaneous and ground up,

4552
03:11:24,960 --> 03:11:27,750
and wasn't supported by any money.

4553
03:11:27,750 --> 03:11:28,583
Nobody planned it.

4554
03:11:28,583 --> 03:11:29,730
It just happened.

4555
03:11:29,730 --> 03:11:30,930
Friedman's a different case

4556
03:11:30,930 --> 03:11:33,060
in that he joins an established tradition

4557
03:11:33,060 --> 03:11:35,970
of thought that's been institutionalized in universities.

4558
03:11:35,970 --> 03:11:38,070
So people are signing up and paying money

4559
03:11:38,070 --> 03:11:40,410
and getting credential to learn these ideas.

4560
03:11:40,410 --> 03:11:42,810
So to my mind, these are two different ways,

4561
03:11:42,810 --> 03:11:46,410
but really emblematic ways of how ideas spread.

4562
03:11:46,410 --> 03:11:48,540
So Rand, I think of as more bottom-up.

4563
03:11:48,540 --> 03:11:51,120
Like people encounter the idea in a book,

4564
03:11:51,120 --> 03:11:53,250
they're kind of blown away by it, or they imbibe it

4565
03:11:53,250 --> 03:11:55,380
without even realizing they're imbibing it.

4566
03:11:55,380 --> 03:11:56,213
And then they're like,

4567
03:11:56,213 --> 03:11:58,230
"Well, maybe I don't like Franklin Roosevelt so much,

4568
03:11:58,230 --> 03:12:02,340
or maybe I'll look another time at Barry Goldwater."

4569
03:12:02,340 --> 03:12:05,670
Whereas Friedman, you get the idea more top-down.

4570
03:12:05,670 --> 03:12:06,930
I know I'm getting the idea.

4571
03:12:06,930 --> 03:12:08,220
I know I'm being positioned

4572
03:12:08,220 --> 03:12:11,067
within a sort of elite discourse of economics.

4573
03:12:11,067 --> 03:12:13,230
And so I think they kind of go top-down

4574
03:12:13,230 --> 03:12:16,410
and bottom-up, and then they hit the events.

4575
03:12:16,410 --> 03:12:18,660
Friedman's ideas wouldn't have gone anywhere

4576
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:21,480
without that episode of stagflation

4577
03:12:21,480 --> 03:12:24,150
that really made people think they proved out.

4578
03:12:24,150 --> 03:12:26,640
And I think Rand's ideas really caught fire

4579
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:29,160
in Cold War America that's looking for a statement

4580
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:31,740
of, what does it mean to be an individual?

4581
03:12:31,740 --> 03:12:34,290
What does it mean to live in this mass society?

4582
03:12:34,290 --> 03:12:37,380
Because it's also a time of great social conformity

4583
03:12:37,380 --> 03:12:38,790
and where people are suddenly,

4584
03:12:38,790 --> 03:12:40,863
they're working for large corporations,

4585
03:12:41,940 --> 03:12:44,043
they've been served in a large military.

4586
03:12:45,480 --> 03:12:47,520
The United States is stepping out onto the world stage.

4587
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:48,390
Everything is bigger.

4588
03:12:48,390 --> 03:12:50,160
What does it mean to be an individual in that world?

4589
03:12:50,160 --> 03:12:52,470
And that's where Rand's ideas catch fire.

4590
03:12:52,470 --> 03:12:54,600
So I think a lot about that,

4591
03:12:54,600 --> 03:12:56,640
about how they trickle through different levels of society

4592
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:59,520
and then how ideas collide with experience,

4593
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:00,510
I think is critical.

4594
03:13:00,510 --> 03:13:01,353
- What do you think about, like,

4595
03:13:01,353 --> 03:13:04,410
when they actually take power in government?

4596
03:13:04,410 --> 03:13:07,650
So I think about ideas like Marxism

4597
03:13:07,650 --> 03:13:11,790
and how that evolves into the Bolshevik Revolution,

4598
03:13:11,790 --> 03:13:14,550
how that takes hold in its implementations.

4599
03:13:14,550 --> 03:13:18,030
Or you can think about Nazism and with Hitler,

4600
03:13:18,030 --> 03:13:20,790
where it goes from a small number

4601
03:13:20,790 --> 03:13:22,350
of people that get real excited about a thing,

4602
03:13:22,350 --> 03:13:25,710
and then like somehow just becomes viral

4603
03:13:25,710 --> 03:13:27,390
and takes hold in power.

4604
03:13:27,390 --> 03:13:30,540
And then that has its consequences.

4605
03:13:30,540 --> 03:13:32,970
- When I think about this

4606
03:13:32,970 --> 03:13:36,330
sort of historical path of communism

4607
03:13:36,330 --> 03:13:40,200
and the kind of logics and dynamics of communism, I mean,

4608
03:13:40,200 --> 03:13:43,860
in many ways it has some echoes with Rand

4609
03:13:43,860 --> 03:13:48,600
in that the ideology in its purest form is almost,

4610
03:13:48,600 --> 03:13:50,580
it's a rationalist ideology of some ways.

4611
03:13:50,580 --> 03:13:51,810
It's an analysis of history

4612
03:13:51,810 --> 03:13:52,920
and how things are supposed to be.

4613
03:13:52,920 --> 03:13:55,050
And I think you mentioned Hannah Arendt.

4614
03:13:55,050 --> 03:13:56,250
I think she has one of the most

4615
03:13:56,250 --> 03:13:58,020
kind of penetrating analyses

4616
03:13:58,020 --> 03:14:01,650
of communism which she really puts in the category of like,

4617
03:14:01,650 --> 03:14:04,740
it's a logical ideology.

4618
03:14:04,740 --> 03:14:07,410
Logic leads inexorably to its conclusions.

4619
03:14:07,410 --> 03:14:10,920
And then experience crops up and experience is different.

4620
03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:14,700
And what does a sort of cult of rationality do

4621
03:14:14,700 --> 03:14:15,780
when it hits experience?

4622
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:18,103
Well, it tries to bend experience to its will.

4623
03:14:18,103 --> 03:14:18,990
And that, I think,

4624
03:14:18,990 --> 03:14:22,593
is really the story of communism writ large.

4625
03:14:24,540 --> 03:14:28,620
So the question though is, why does it catch fire?

4626
03:14:28,620 --> 03:14:31,350
Why does it draw people into political allegiance?

4627
03:14:31,350 --> 03:14:33,090
I think in the case of communism,

4628
03:14:33,090 --> 03:14:36,780
it's this dream of a more ethical world,

4629
03:14:36,780 --> 03:14:37,980
dream of equality,

4630
03:14:37,980 --> 03:14:40,800
dream of the powerless rising up against the powerful.

4631
03:14:40,800 --> 03:14:44,220
I mean, that's drawn in so many.

4632
03:14:44,220 --> 03:14:48,150
And then you had the whole addition of Leninism,

4633
03:14:48,150 --> 03:14:50,760
which gave a kind of international cast to that

4634
03:14:50,760 --> 03:14:52,590
and helped people think

4635
03:14:52,590 --> 03:14:54,480
about what are the relations between poorer

4636
03:14:54,480 --> 03:14:55,410
and richer countries,

4637
03:14:55,410 --> 03:14:56,700
and what can we expect out of them,

4638
03:14:56,700 --> 03:14:57,540
and what might happen,

4639
03:14:57,540 --> 03:15:00,330
gave a sort of a framework for thinking about that

4640
03:15:00,330 --> 03:15:04,050
in a time when the world was becoming more interconnected

4641
03:15:04,050 --> 03:15:06,500
and those differences were becoming more obvious.

4642
03:15:07,620 --> 03:15:12,620
Fascism, to me is unleashing more something primal,

4643
03:15:13,800 --> 03:15:16,800
something sort of dark and primal within people.

4644
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:21,510
And it's more a permission structure to indulge in that

4645
03:15:21,510 --> 03:15:23,100
that is normally not there.

4646
03:15:23,100 --> 03:15:25,530
Those impulses are normally channeled or held down.

4647
03:15:25,530 --> 03:15:28,650
And it seems that when the fascist regimes come into power,

4648
03:15:28,650 --> 03:15:32,520
they give people permission to let those forces out.

4649
03:15:32,520 --> 03:15:33,783
- I think on communism,

4650
03:15:34,950 --> 03:15:37,863
going back to that lecture that Ayn Rand gave,

4651
03:15:39,480 --> 03:15:42,243
I think what rings true to me a little bit is that,

4652
03:15:43,380 --> 03:15:47,010
what fuels it is a kind of, maybe not resentment,

4653
03:15:47,010 --> 03:15:51,303
but envy towards the people that have,

4654
03:15:52,140 --> 03:15:53,850
the have-nots versus the haves.

4655
03:15:53,850 --> 03:15:56,520
And there is some degree to which Nazism has the same

4656
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:58,710
of envy towards some group,

4657
03:15:58,710 --> 03:16:00,330
resentment towards some group.

4658
03:16:00,330 --> 03:16:03,840
So it's given the environment of hard times,

4659
03:16:03,840 --> 03:16:05,760
hard economic times,

4660
03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:09,370
combined with the more primal just envy

4661
03:16:10,320 --> 03:16:12,717
of not having and seeing somebody who has it

4662
03:16:12,717 --> 03:16:16,020
and just constructing a narrative around that.

4663
03:16:16,020 --> 03:16:19,290
That can become a real viral idea.

4664
03:16:19,290 --> 03:16:22,140
- Yeah, it seems like communism is more animated

4665
03:16:22,140 --> 03:16:23,700
by this idea of injustice.

4666
03:16:23,700 --> 03:16:26,550
You know, the world is unjust, it should be different.

4667
03:16:26,550 --> 03:16:30,930
And fascism seems like the process of scapegoating.

4668
03:16:30,930 --> 03:16:34,260
We've identified the source of the problem,

4669
03:16:34,260 --> 03:16:36,150
and it's this group,

4670
03:16:36,150 --> 03:16:38,520
and they need to be punished

4671
03:16:38,520 --> 03:16:40,560
for what they've done to the rest of us.

4672
03:16:40,560 --> 03:16:41,393
- There is a primal thing,

4673
03:16:41,393 --> 03:16:43,650
this is going back to literature,

4674
03:16:43,650 --> 03:16:46,590
in "1984," the Two Minutes Hate

4675
03:16:46,590 --> 03:16:48,540
where you can get everybody real,

4676
03:16:48,540 --> 03:16:51,720
like excited about like hating a thing.

4677
03:16:51,720 --> 03:16:55,530
And there's something primal about us humans where you,

4678
03:16:55,530 --> 03:16:58,080
once you're in that state of hate,

4679
03:16:58,080 --> 03:17:01,980
anyone can direct that hate towards anything.

4680
03:17:01,980 --> 03:17:02,813
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

4681
03:17:04,770 --> 03:17:06,000
- Yeah, towards any group,

4682
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:07,860
towards any idea, towards anything,

4683
03:17:07,860 --> 03:17:10,170
because we could get caught up

4684
03:17:10,170 --> 03:17:12,690
in the mass hysteria of the hatred.

4685
03:17:12,690 --> 03:17:14,100
It's a dangerous thing.

4686
03:17:14,100 --> 03:17:15,480
- Yeah.

4687
03:17:15,480 --> 03:17:19,350
- You floated the idea, I forget where,

4688
03:17:19,350 --> 03:17:22,200
of pivoting for your next book

4689
03:17:22,200 --> 03:17:26,403
towards maybe writing about postmodernism,

4690
03:17:27,510 --> 03:17:29,730
which is a set of ideas almost the opposite

4691
03:17:29,730 --> 03:17:30,960
of Ayn Rand's philosophy.

4692
03:17:30,960 --> 03:17:35,760
So can you maybe explain your curiosity about,

4693
03:17:35,760 --> 03:17:37,320
first of all, spaces of ideas,

4694
03:17:37,320 --> 03:17:40,620
but maybe postmodernism?

4695
03:17:40,620 --> 03:17:43,140
- Yeah, I mean, I think in the broadest sense,

4696
03:17:43,140 --> 03:17:44,730
what I'm interested in,

4697
03:17:44,730 --> 03:17:46,950
kind of two dimensions that guide me

4698
03:17:46,950 --> 03:17:48,390
in doing intellectual history.

4699
03:17:48,390 --> 03:17:49,320
One is what I talked about,

4700
03:17:49,320 --> 03:17:52,710
like how does an idea go from a book,

4701
03:17:52,710 --> 03:17:56,220
an elite space, out to more popular dimensions?

4702
03:17:56,220 --> 03:17:57,210
Like, how does that happen?

4703
03:17:57,210 --> 03:17:58,710
What happens to the idea along the way?

4704
03:17:58,710 --> 03:18:00,450
How is it distorted or changed?

4705
03:18:00,450 --> 03:18:01,740
And the other is just search

4706
03:18:01,740 --> 03:18:05,460
for meaning in a post-Christian era or a secular era.

4707
03:18:05,460 --> 03:18:07,980
Like what are people coming up with?

4708
03:18:07,980 --> 03:18:12,300
And I think to replace that void in their religious

4709
03:18:12,300 --> 03:18:13,140
or spiritual lives.

4710
03:18:13,140 --> 03:18:15,120
I think both Rand and Friedman

4711
03:18:15,120 --> 03:18:17,010
offered these sort of alternatives, right?

4712
03:18:17,010 --> 03:18:20,193
Objectivism, this quasi-rationalist religion.

4713
03:18:21,060 --> 03:18:26,060
People take economics as a theory of the world that almost,

4714
03:18:26,430 --> 03:18:27,960
you can almost believe in it, right?

4715
03:18:27,960 --> 03:18:29,400
It can almost take that place.

4716
03:18:29,400 --> 03:18:31,560
And in both cases, how do those ideas travel?

4717
03:18:31,560 --> 03:18:33,810
When I think about postmodernism, you know,

4718
03:18:33,810 --> 03:18:35,163
it first struck me,

4719
03:18:36,390 --> 03:18:39,030
if you read the original postmodern thinkers,

4720
03:18:39,030 --> 03:18:39,863
it's really tough going.

4721
03:18:39,863 --> 03:18:42,750
I mean, I make my students do it and they suffer.

4722
03:18:42,750 --> 03:18:44,130
I think they see it's worthwhile,

4723
03:18:44,130 --> 03:18:46,830
but it's no fun to read Derrida, you know?

4724
03:18:46,830 --> 03:18:48,720
But somehow it's trickled down

4725
03:18:48,720 --> 03:18:52,230
into how do we go from Derrida to Tumblr?

4726
03:18:52,230 --> 03:18:53,580
And I sort of realized, like,

4727
03:18:53,580 --> 03:18:55,710
oh, this has happened with postmodernism.

4728
03:18:55,710 --> 03:18:58,470
It's followed the same path

4729
03:18:58,470 --> 03:19:01,410
that, say, from Milton Friedman's economic theory

4730
03:19:01,410 --> 03:19:03,150
to free to choose on YouTube.

4731
03:19:03,150 --> 03:19:04,260
We've had a similar path (Lex chuckles)

4732
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:07,380
of high French theory down to Tumblr,

4733
03:19:07,380 --> 03:19:11,430
and, you know, I sexually identify as an attack helicopter

4734
03:19:11,430 --> 03:19:12,480
or whatever it may be.

4735
03:19:12,480 --> 03:19:15,660
And so that was really interesting.

4736
03:19:15,660 --> 03:19:17,047
And then I also thought,

4737
03:19:17,047 --> 03:19:19,950
"Well, at the same time,

4738
03:19:19,950 --> 03:19:22,230
this is clearly a structure of meaning."

4739
03:19:22,230 --> 03:19:25,140
And I actually think it's followed the same path

4740
03:19:25,140 --> 03:19:28,650
of Objectivism, which is turning into its opposite,

4741
03:19:28,650 --> 03:19:31,110
like distilled down and then turning into its opposite.

4742
03:19:31,110 --> 03:19:33,120
So if Objectivism was a group

4743
03:19:33,120 --> 03:19:35,550
of people who considered themselves individualists

4744
03:19:35,550 --> 03:19:38,190
who ended up deeply conforming to the dictates

4745
03:19:38,190 --> 03:19:40,170
of a charismatic leader, you know,

4746
03:19:40,170 --> 03:19:43,470
postmodernism started about disrupting binaries.

4747
03:19:43,470 --> 03:19:45,480
That was, we're going to be fluid,

4748
03:19:45,480 --> 03:19:46,650
we're going to go beyond the border,

4749
03:19:46,650 --> 03:19:48,720
we're going to disrupt the binary.

4750
03:19:48,720 --> 03:19:49,620
And it's devolved

4751
03:19:49,620 --> 03:19:52,500
in its popular forms to the reinscribing

4752
03:19:52,500 --> 03:19:55,950
of many different binaries, oppressor and oppressed.

4753
03:19:55,950 --> 03:19:58,020
You know, it's become this paradigmatic set

4754
03:19:58,020 --> 03:20:00,450
of glasses you put on to understand the world.

4755
03:20:00,450 --> 03:20:02,820
So I think it is the dynamics are very, very similar.

4756
03:20:02,820 --> 03:20:05,430
So I think it's something in the traffic of the idea

4757
03:20:05,430 --> 03:20:09,240
from its pure form to its popular form,

4758
03:20:09,240 --> 03:20:11,250
and then how it gets politicized

4759
03:20:11,250 --> 03:20:12,570
or mobilized in different ways.

4760
03:20:12,570 --> 03:20:13,680
And behind it all, I think,

4761
03:20:13,680 --> 03:20:16,230
is this human longing for meaning

4762
03:20:16,230 --> 03:20:19,200
and the inadequacy of the traditional ways

4763
03:20:19,200 --> 03:20:21,877
that need was met at this point in time.

4764
03:20:21,877 --> 03:20:22,710
- By the way,

4765
03:20:22,710 --> 03:20:25,680
that going from pure form to popular form.

4766
03:20:25,680 --> 03:20:28,470
I remember, this might be before the Internet,

4767
03:20:28,470 --> 03:20:32,340
but when I was in college reading Derrida, Foucault,

4768
03:20:32,340 --> 03:20:35,610
and not knowing context at all,

4769
03:20:35,610 --> 03:20:36,750
it was just interesting.

4770
03:20:36,750 --> 03:20:38,250
All right, this is,

4771
03:20:38,250 --> 03:20:41,901
like I'm able to read pure encapsulations of an idea

4772
03:20:41,901 --> 03:20:42,734
and just kind of like,

4773
03:20:42,734 --> 03:20:45,390
all right, well, that person believes that,

4774
03:20:45,390 --> 03:20:46,710
and you just kind of hold it.

4775
03:20:46,710 --> 03:20:48,090
But then you realize

4776
03:20:48,090 --> 03:20:50,490
if you actually take the pure form of that idea

4777
03:20:50,490 --> 03:20:52,500
and then it creates a community around it,

4778
03:20:52,500 --> 03:20:54,630
you realize what that actually becomes.

4779
03:20:54,630 --> 03:20:55,463
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

4780
03:20:55,463 --> 03:20:59,160
- And you're like, "Oh, yeah, no, I don't." (laughs)

4781
03:20:59,160 --> 03:21:03,397
Although I do consider myself sexually an attack helicopter.

4782
03:21:03,397 --> 03:21:06,360
That's it, identify sexually, yes, beautiful.

4783
03:21:06,360 --> 03:21:07,193
Okay.

4784
03:21:09,480 --> 03:21:13,770
Your process of researching for, let's say,

4785
03:21:13,770 --> 03:21:16,440
the biographies of Milton Friedman, Ayn Rand,

4786
03:21:16,440 --> 03:21:20,070
seems like an insane amount of work.

4787
03:21:20,070 --> 03:21:20,903
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

4788
03:21:20,903 --> 03:21:22,800
- You did incredible work there,

4789
03:21:22,800 --> 03:21:25,440
going to the original sources.

4790
03:21:25,440 --> 03:21:27,180
Can you maybe speak to that?

4791
03:21:27,180 --> 03:21:30,580
What is required to persevere

4792
03:21:31,770 --> 03:21:36,770
and to go for so many years to go so deep to the sources?

4793
03:21:37,230 --> 03:21:40,830
- Yeah, so, I mean, I go to the archive.

4794
03:21:40,830 --> 03:21:44,580
That's where I feel like I'm communing with the dead

4795
03:21:44,580 --> 03:21:45,413
in some ways,

4796
03:21:45,413 --> 03:21:48,150
you know, I'm seeing what they saw in some ways

4797
03:21:48,150 --> 03:21:49,950
and reading what they felt.

4798
03:21:49,950 --> 03:21:53,220
And I tell my doctoral students,

4799
03:21:53,220 --> 03:21:54,690
it's gotta be something that gets you out of bed

4800
03:21:54,690 --> 03:21:57,210
in the morning, because there comes a point

4801
03:21:57,210 --> 03:22:00,690
in your doctoral career when there's nowhere to go,

4802
03:22:00,690 --> 03:22:01,800
there's nowhere to be.

4803
03:22:01,800 --> 03:22:02,633
You gotta be getting up

4804
03:22:02,633 --> 03:22:04,260
because you're interested in what you want to study.

4805
03:22:04,260 --> 03:22:06,540
And so with Rand, it was this real sense of discovery,

4806
03:22:06,540 --> 03:22:07,650
like I am discovering.

4807
03:22:07,650 --> 03:22:09,060
I want to know about this woman.

4808
03:22:09,060 --> 03:22:10,527
I want to know where she fits.

4809
03:22:10,527 --> 03:22:11,360
And the only way to find out

4810
03:22:11,360 --> 03:22:13,560
is to do the research, you know?

4811
03:22:13,560 --> 03:22:18,560
And so, yeah, I like to go deep.

4812
03:22:18,930 --> 03:22:20,523
It's really interesting to me.

4813
03:22:21,570 --> 03:22:23,340
And I should say, in both of these cases,

4814
03:22:23,340 --> 03:22:25,260
I've done it in an institutional structure.

4815
03:22:25,260 --> 03:22:27,240
I don't know that I would do it independently.

4816
03:22:27,240 --> 03:22:29,340
So the first was a graduate program in history,

4817
03:22:29,340 --> 03:22:30,930
was at UC Berkeley.

4818
03:22:30,930 --> 03:22:33,720
And so I had coursework,

4819
03:22:33,720 --> 03:22:34,830
and then I had structures,

4820
03:22:34,830 --> 03:22:36,540
and I did have people to check in with and read,

4821
03:22:36,540 --> 03:22:39,210
but I had a great deal of latitude I'm very grateful for.

4822
03:22:39,210 --> 03:22:40,043
People are like,

4823
03:22:40,043 --> 03:22:41,880
"You wrote a dissertation on Ayn Rand at Berkeley?"

4824
03:22:41,880 --> 03:22:43,470
I'm like, "Yeah, hell, I did."

4825
03:22:43,470 --> 03:22:46,200
You know, Berkeley's like, it's a great place.

4826
03:22:46,200 --> 03:22:47,130
At the time I was there,

4827
03:22:47,130 --> 03:22:49,590
there was absolute room for free inquiry.

4828
03:22:49,590 --> 03:22:51,360
- Oh, can you just linger on that?

4829
03:22:51,360 --> 03:22:53,880
So when you said that you're doing that

4830
03:22:53,880 --> 03:22:55,773
and doing a dissertation on Ayn Rand,

4831
03:22:57,545 --> 03:23:00,420
did people get upset?

4832
03:23:00,420 --> 03:23:03,450
- No, I did have a friendly critic

4833
03:23:03,450 --> 03:23:06,330
who took it upon himself to throw at me

4834
03:23:06,330 --> 03:23:09,120
everything he thought the outside world would throw at me.

4835
03:23:09,120 --> 03:23:11,790
I think maybe 5 or 10 years earlier,

4836
03:23:11,790 --> 03:23:13,470
it wouldn't have been possible.

4837
03:23:13,470 --> 03:23:15,603
But the most important thing I had to,

4838
03:23:16,980 --> 03:23:17,880
the person I really had

4839
03:23:17,880 --> 03:23:20,310
to convince this was worth doing was myself, you know,

4840
03:23:20,310 --> 03:23:23,700
because I knew it was an unconventional choice for the field

4841
03:23:23,700 --> 03:23:24,780
and for a dissertation.

4842
03:23:24,780 --> 03:23:27,397
But once I convinced myself, I just said,

4843
03:23:27,397 --> 03:23:29,130
"Well, we're going to do this and see."

4844
03:23:29,130 --> 03:23:30,413
And because it was unconventional,

4845
03:23:30,413 --> 03:23:32,880
it ended up standing out.

4846
03:23:32,880 --> 03:23:34,653
But it really was the time.

4847
03:23:36,180 --> 03:23:39,328
I started it during Second Bush Administration,

4848
03:23:39,328 --> 03:23:42,450
George W. Bush, second term.

4849
03:23:42,450 --> 03:23:45,120
People were interested in just conservatism in general

4850
03:23:45,120 --> 03:23:47,490
and felt no matter where they stood

4851
03:23:47,490 --> 03:23:49,380
on the political spectrum, felt like, objectively,

4852
03:23:49,380 --> 03:23:51,077
we don't know enough about this, and this is a problem.

4853
03:23:51,077 --> 03:23:53,310
And so they were open to learning more,

4854
03:23:53,310 --> 03:23:56,820
so I really kind of caught that wave in scholarship

4855
03:23:56,820 --> 03:23:57,653
and caught that wave

4856
03:23:57,653 --> 03:23:59,640
in American culture where people wanted to know more.

4857
03:23:59,640 --> 03:24:00,750
- We should probably say that,

4858
03:24:00,750 --> 03:24:04,500
I mean, Ayn Rand is, at the very least,

4859
03:24:04,500 --> 03:24:05,550
as you've mentioned,

4860
03:24:05,550 --> 03:24:07,200
a kind of gateway to conservatism.

4861
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:09,270
- Yes, I called her the gateway drug

4862
03:24:09,270 --> 03:24:10,613
in that people start with Rand.

4863
03:24:10,613 --> 03:24:13,440
They're taken by her.

4864
03:24:13,440 --> 03:24:17,430
In some ways, she takes the worldview of Milton Friedman

4865
03:24:17,430 --> 03:24:21,690
in terms of what capitalism can accomplish economically,

4866
03:24:21,690 --> 03:24:24,480
and then she puts it in this mythopoetic register

4867
03:24:24,480 --> 03:24:25,680
and she fictionalizes it.

4868
03:24:25,680 --> 03:24:28,773
So once people have absorbed that, they want more.

4869
03:24:29,790 --> 03:24:33,390
They go on to learning more of the ideas behind that vision,

4870
03:24:33,390 --> 03:24:36,150
or they have become true believers, they've converted,

4871
03:24:36,150 --> 03:24:38,940
and so then they head off to work for a politician,

4872
03:24:38,940 --> 03:24:40,620
to work for a think tank, to work for a party,

4873
03:24:40,620 --> 03:24:41,550
so absolute traffic.

4874
03:24:41,550 --> 03:24:42,383
Now, not everyone.

4875
03:24:42,383 --> 03:24:43,216
There's plenty of people who read

4876
03:24:43,216 --> 03:24:45,330
on Rand who don't take the politics.

4877
03:24:45,330 --> 03:24:47,130
It's a nice story, it's interesting,

4878
03:24:48,600 --> 03:24:49,800
just an episode in their life.

4879
03:24:49,800 --> 03:24:51,600
But for others, it's really foundational.

4880
03:24:51,600 --> 03:24:52,770
It really, really changes them.

4881
03:24:52,770 --> 03:24:53,940
So those were the people I wanted

4882
03:24:53,940 --> 03:24:55,200
to track very deliberately.

4883
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:57,600
I wasn't trying to do in the round

4884
03:24:57,600 --> 03:24:58,800
everything about Ayn Rand.

4885
03:24:58,800 --> 03:25:01,177
I was like, Ayn Rand and the American Right, you know,

4886
03:25:01,177 --> 03:25:02,370
"Goddess of the Market:

4887
03:25:02,370 --> 03:25:03,960
Ayn Rand and the American Right" is the title.

4888
03:25:03,960 --> 03:25:06,600
So where did they take her,

4889
03:25:06,600 --> 03:25:08,370
those who took her in this political direction?

4890
03:25:08,370 --> 03:25:10,230
What difference did she make?

4891
03:25:10,230 --> 03:25:13,443
- If we return to the actual, your process.

4892
03:25:13,443 --> 03:25:14,370
- [Jennifer] Yeah.

4893
03:25:14,370 --> 03:25:17,671
- So you're showing up and reading sources,

4894
03:25:17,671 --> 03:25:18,504
- [Jennifer] Mhm.

4895
03:25:18,504 --> 03:25:19,680
- And you're like,

4896
03:25:19,680 --> 03:25:21,660
is it kind of like the process of discovery?

4897
03:25:21,660 --> 03:25:23,400
You're just kind of like taking it all in

4898
03:25:23,400 --> 03:25:28,400
and seeing what unifying ideas emerge

4899
03:25:28,620 --> 03:25:32,730
or maybe special moments that illustrate an idea emerge?

4900
03:25:32,730 --> 03:25:36,810
- Yeah, I mean, I know with the biography of a person,

4901
03:25:36,810 --> 03:25:39,570
I am already given a start and an end date

4902
03:25:39,570 --> 03:25:41,610
and a rough narrative of what happens.

4903
03:25:41,610 --> 03:25:43,920
So I have a kind of structure.

4904
03:25:43,920 --> 03:25:46,890
And then both with Rand and Friedman,

4905
03:25:46,890 --> 03:25:49,110
I started by reading their major books,

4906
03:25:49,110 --> 03:25:50,760
before I really read anything about them,

4907
03:25:50,760 --> 03:25:53,250
because I wanted my own experience

4908
03:25:53,250 --> 03:25:54,810
of the material to be fresh.

4909
03:25:54,810 --> 03:25:57,630
And I had read some Ayn Rand, but not a lot.

4910
03:25:57,630 --> 03:25:59,880
Similarly, I had read some Friedman, but not a lot.

4911
03:25:59,880 --> 03:26:03,570
So first is like, let me read the major stuff, get oriented,

4912
03:26:03,570 --> 03:26:06,420
and then just dive into the archive and see what's there.

4913
03:26:07,530 --> 03:26:08,580
Who are they talking to?

4914
03:26:08,580 --> 03:26:10,090
What's going on?

4915
03:26:10,090 --> 03:26:12,480
In Rand's case,

4916
03:26:12,480 --> 03:26:14,970
I was interested in her in the United States,

4917
03:26:14,970 --> 03:26:15,810
not her in Russia.

4918
03:26:15,810 --> 03:26:18,420
I didn't have the language skills to do that.

4919
03:26:18,420 --> 03:26:20,070
So I start her in the United States,

4920
03:26:20,070 --> 03:26:22,260
and I start when she publishes her first book,

4921
03:26:22,260 --> 03:26:23,940
and she starts getting letters,

4922
03:26:23,940 --> 03:26:25,290
and who is she writing to?

4923
03:26:25,290 --> 03:26:27,150
Who's writing to her?

4924
03:26:27,150 --> 03:26:28,770
And then I start to uncover this world

4925
03:26:28,770 --> 03:26:30,330
of kind of nascent conservatism.

4926
03:26:30,330 --> 03:26:31,770
And I'm kind of putting that together.

4927
03:26:31,770 --> 03:26:33,697
And once I have enough, I say,

4928
03:26:33,697 --> 03:26:34,860
"Well, that's a chapter.

4929
03:26:34,860 --> 03:26:36,780
I'm gonna cover that chapter,

4930
03:26:36,780 --> 03:26:38,940
and then there's gonna be, you know,

4931
03:26:38,940 --> 03:26:39,990
the book has come out,

4932
03:26:39,990 --> 03:26:41,640
and so now I need to start a different chapter.

4933
03:26:41,640 --> 03:26:43,860
What's her life like after the book has been published?"

4934
03:26:43,860 --> 03:26:45,000
You know, and then I look for that.

4935
03:26:45,000 --> 03:26:45,833
But I'm really,

4936
03:26:45,833 --> 03:26:48,810
although I have this very high level structure,

4937
03:26:48,810 --> 03:26:50,730
it's coming out of the archive,

4938
03:26:50,730 --> 03:26:52,740
the material I'm finding.

4939
03:26:52,740 --> 03:26:54,810
And if I'm not finding the material there,

4940
03:26:54,810 --> 03:26:57,180
I won't cover it in great detail.

4941
03:26:57,180 --> 03:26:59,730
Or if I've decided it's outside my ambit,

4942
03:26:59,730 --> 03:27:01,950
I'm not gonna go into great depth on it.

4943
03:27:01,950 --> 03:27:03,810
- And your trying to understand the relationships

4944
03:27:03,810 --> 03:27:04,740
is so fascinating.

4945
03:27:04,740 --> 03:27:08,130
Like reconstruct, in a dark room,

4946
03:27:08,130 --> 03:27:09,840
trying to reconstruct,

4947
03:27:09,840 --> 03:27:12,780
shine a light on relationships through reading letters.

4948
03:27:12,780 --> 03:27:13,804
It's interesting.

4949
03:27:13,804 --> 03:27:14,637
- Yeah, yeah.

4950
03:27:14,637 --> 03:27:17,100
I mean, correspondence is really, really helpful.

4951
03:27:17,100 --> 03:27:18,840
Drafts, correspondence.

4952
03:27:18,840 --> 03:27:22,170
And someone this famous, they have oral histories.

4953
03:27:22,170 --> 03:27:23,670
Other people write about them.

4954
03:27:23,670 --> 03:27:25,170
So you're reading all these different things

4955
03:27:25,170 --> 03:27:26,280
and kind of triangulating

4956
03:27:26,280 --> 03:27:27,870
and trying to sort of put them together,

4957
03:27:27,870 --> 03:27:29,550
and then think about,

4958
03:27:29,550 --> 03:27:31,680
how do I present this in a compelling story

4959
03:27:31,680 --> 03:27:33,930
and what do I need to explain?

4960
03:27:33,930 --> 03:27:34,830
And then also for me,

4961
03:27:34,830 --> 03:27:38,010
what was really helpful was that because I teach

4962
03:27:38,010 --> 03:27:40,380
and I am explaining the kind of broad sweep

4963
03:27:40,380 --> 03:27:41,760
of 20th century history,

4964
03:27:41,760 --> 03:27:46,440
so I know that Rand's involved in a labor action

4965
03:27:46,440 --> 03:27:47,686
at Warner Brothers,

4966
03:27:47,686 --> 03:27:49,410
but through my teaching, I realized,

4967
03:27:49,410 --> 03:27:51,600
oh, yes, this is a moment of labor strikes

4968
03:27:51,600 --> 03:27:53,100
across the country.

4969
03:27:53,100 --> 03:27:56,370
And so then that really changes the origin story

4970
03:27:56,370 --> 03:28:00,240
of "Atlas Shrugged," because she's looking at labor actions,

4971
03:28:00,240 --> 03:28:02,130
and she originally thinking of the book

4972
03:28:02,130 --> 03:28:03,900
as being called "The Strike."

4973
03:28:03,900 --> 03:28:06,207
So she's really responding in real time

4974
03:28:06,207 --> 03:28:07,230
and being inspired

4975
03:28:07,230 --> 03:28:12,230
by what's happening in the mid-1940s in the United States.

4976
03:28:12,360 --> 03:28:13,770
So then I can kind of take that,

4977
03:28:13,770 --> 03:28:16,140
and run with that, and figure out where to go.

4978
03:28:16,140 --> 03:28:18,870
- So you're super passionate about teaching.

4979
03:28:18,870 --> 03:28:19,980
You mentioned Milton Friedman

4980
03:28:19,980 --> 03:28:24,980
had a very interesting way of teaching.

4981
03:28:25,170 --> 03:28:27,960
So how do you think of teaching?

4982
03:28:27,960 --> 03:28:30,060
Teaching history, teaching history of ideas,

4983
03:28:30,060 --> 03:28:33,360
teaching bright young minds about the past?

4984
03:28:33,360 --> 03:28:34,193
- Yeah, I mean, it's great.

4985
03:28:34,193 --> 03:28:36,330
It's really inspiring.

4986
03:28:36,330 --> 03:28:39,000
The ways, the old-school kind of dominating way

4987
03:28:39,000 --> 03:28:40,920
in which Friedman taught would not fly

4988
03:28:40,920 --> 03:28:44,610
in today's university, wouldn't be permitted,

4989
03:28:44,610 --> 03:28:47,190
and also the students wouldn't respond to it, you know,

4990
03:28:47,190 --> 03:28:50,520
so I try to share my enthusiasm.

4991
03:28:50,520 --> 03:28:52,770
I think that's like almost the number one thing I bring

4992
03:28:52,770 --> 03:28:53,730
is my enthusiasm.

4993
03:28:53,730 --> 03:28:56,580
Like, look how neat and interesting these ideas are.

4994
03:28:56,580 --> 03:28:59,460
I try to keep my own views out pretty much.

4995
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:02,850
I try to give the fairest possible rendition I can

4996
03:29:02,850 --> 03:29:04,140
of each thinker.

4997
03:29:04,140 --> 03:29:06,060
If I find someone really disturbing,

4998
03:29:06,060 --> 03:29:08,070
I might sidebar at the end of the lecture

4999
03:29:08,070 --> 03:29:10,620
and say this kind of, you know, I find this unsettling,

5000
03:29:10,620 --> 03:29:13,320
and this tells me something about myself.

5001
03:29:13,320 --> 03:29:15,270
But most of the time,

5002
03:29:15,270 --> 03:29:18,450
I'm bringing people into the biography of a great thinker,

5003
03:29:18,450 --> 03:29:19,680
the context of them.

5004
03:29:19,680 --> 03:29:21,420
And then in the lecture,

5005
03:29:21,420 --> 03:29:23,400
we'll literally read the work together

5006
03:29:23,400 --> 03:29:25,297
and we'll talk about it, and I'll ask the students,

5007
03:29:25,297 --> 03:29:26,970
"What are you keep finding here?

5008
03:29:26,970 --> 03:29:28,407
What's jumping out at you?"

5009
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:32,160
Kind of breaking down the language

5010
03:29:32,160 --> 03:29:34,500
and really teaching them how to do deep reading.

5011
03:29:34,500 --> 03:29:37,170
So I feel like that is my contribution right now.

5012
03:29:37,170 --> 03:29:39,368
We're having trouble reading collectively.

5013
03:29:39,368 --> 03:29:42,000
We're having trouble paying attention collectively.

5014
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:46,170
And I'm trying to cultivate their skills to doing that

5015
03:29:46,170 --> 03:29:47,520
and showing them how I do it.

5016
03:29:47,520 --> 03:29:49,800
And also modeling, like this is how I would read a text.

5017
03:29:49,800 --> 03:29:53,040
This is what jumps out to me when I look at, you know,

5018
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:55,053
Thomas Kuhn or something like this,

5019
03:29:55,950 --> 03:29:57,750
and just show them that studying a history

5020
03:29:57,750 --> 03:29:59,100
of ideas is really fun.

5021
03:29:59,100 --> 03:30:01,444
I feel incredibly privileged to do it, you know,

5022
03:30:01,444 --> 03:30:03,960
and the other thing is, I think this is the time

5023
03:30:03,960 --> 03:30:07,920
for students in college figuring out who they are.

5024
03:30:07,920 --> 03:30:10,200
Their minds are developing and growing.

5025
03:30:10,200 --> 03:30:13,140
They can really handle complicated, hard ideas.

5026
03:30:13,140 --> 03:30:14,910
They don't always have the context behind them.

5027
03:30:14,910 --> 03:30:16,410
So I need to give them the hard ideas

5028
03:30:16,410 --> 03:30:18,210
and then show them this is kind of the context,

5029
03:30:18,210 --> 03:30:19,920
what's happening in the world.

5030
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:21,810
But really I'm just,

5031
03:30:21,810 --> 03:30:23,430
I'm showing them the landscape.

5032
03:30:23,430 --> 03:30:25,710
I don't have time to go deep.

5033
03:30:25,710 --> 03:30:27,420
We have a 10-week quarter, you know,

5034
03:30:27,420 --> 03:30:29,400
I'm giving them a flyover,

5035
03:30:29,400 --> 03:30:32,070
and then I want them to know how to go deep

5036
03:30:32,070 --> 03:30:33,810
and know where they want to go deep.

5037
03:30:33,810 --> 03:30:35,490
- Do the thing that Milton Friedman did,

5038
03:30:35,490 --> 03:30:38,453
which is, in parallel, have a list of books.

5039
03:30:38,453 --> 03:30:40,620
- Yes, do their own parallel curriculum.

5040
03:30:40,620 --> 03:30:42,210
Exactly, exactly.

5041
03:30:42,210 --> 03:30:45,030
- What advice would you give in terms of reading

5042
03:30:45,030 --> 03:30:46,410
about ideas you agree with

5043
03:30:46,410 --> 03:30:48,510
and reading ideas you disagree with?

5044
03:30:48,510 --> 03:30:50,940
- I mean, even though I think the passion is important

5045
03:30:50,940 --> 03:30:52,500
for the teaching of the ideas,

5046
03:30:52,500 --> 03:30:55,110
like dispassion is more important for the reading

5047
03:30:55,110 --> 03:30:56,643
and understanding of them.

5048
03:30:57,990 --> 03:31:00,307
So a lot of people have said to me, like,

5049
03:31:00,307 --> 03:31:01,890
"I could never write about Ayn Rand.

5050
03:31:01,890 --> 03:31:04,110
She makes me so angry."

5051
03:31:04,110 --> 03:31:05,730
And I've never become,

5052
03:31:05,730 --> 03:31:07,500
I don't get angry reading her.

5053
03:31:07,500 --> 03:31:09,720
I'm like, "Oh, there you go again," you know?

5054
03:31:09,720 --> 03:31:12,420
Or like, "Well, that's gonna cause trouble," you know?

5055
03:31:12,420 --> 03:31:16,740
And so, I guess I'm approaching it with a sort of charity,

5056
03:31:16,740 --> 03:31:19,740
but also with this, I don't have huge expectations.

5057
03:31:19,740 --> 03:31:22,290
I'm not expecting to have the light shine on me.

5058
03:31:22,290 --> 03:31:23,763
I'm not expecting to agree.

5059
03:31:24,600 --> 03:31:26,280
I can be very clinical about it.

5060
03:31:26,280 --> 03:31:28,140
So that's what's worked for me.

5061
03:31:28,140 --> 03:31:31,470
It might not work for others.

5062
03:31:31,470 --> 03:31:34,170
And then I just try to find the humor in it.

5063
03:31:34,170 --> 03:31:36,000
Like, how funny is it?

5064
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:37,710
These different aspects of them, you know,

5065
03:31:37,710 --> 03:31:41,850
like when teaching my students about Oliver Wendell Holmes,

5066
03:31:41,850 --> 03:31:43,973
his dad wrote a poem about him,

5067
03:31:43,973 --> 03:31:46,320
he called him, "The Astronaut,"

5068
03:31:46,320 --> 03:31:47,970
about how he came from outer space.

5069
03:31:47,970 --> 03:31:49,560
He seemed like he came from outer space.

5070
03:31:49,560 --> 03:31:52,560
I'm like, "This is his dad's view of his son.

5071
03:31:52,560 --> 03:31:54,467
That's how weird of a guy he was," you know?

5072
03:31:54,467 --> 03:31:55,300
- [Lex] (chuckles) Yeah.

5073
03:31:55,300 --> 03:31:56,700
- And so I try to find that,

5074
03:31:56,700 --> 03:31:59,220
keep alert for those funny kind of human touches,

5075
03:31:59,220 --> 03:32:01,770
that these are ultimately just people,

5076
03:32:01,770 --> 03:32:04,350
people with ideas that they spent enough time polishing up

5077
03:32:04,350 --> 03:32:05,730
and developing that we still want to read

5078
03:32:05,730 --> 03:32:07,740
about them 100 years later.

5079
03:32:07,740 --> 03:32:10,620
- What about the dramatic formulation of that same question?

5080
03:32:10,620 --> 03:32:12,330
Do you think there's some ideas that are good

5081
03:32:12,330 --> 03:32:14,070
and some of that are evil?

5082
03:32:14,070 --> 03:32:15,780
Do you think we can draw such lines

5083
03:32:15,780 --> 03:32:17,580
or is it more complicated,

5084
03:32:17,580 --> 03:32:20,970
like the old Solzhenitsyn line between good and evil

5085
03:32:20,970 --> 03:32:23,160
that runs through the heart of every person?

5086
03:32:23,160 --> 03:32:25,590
- I mean, I philosophically agree

5087
03:32:25,590 --> 03:32:27,330
with Solzhenitsyn for sure.

5088
03:32:27,330 --> 03:32:29,430
I do think some ideas pull on the good side

5089
03:32:29,430 --> 03:32:32,550
and some ideas pull on the bad side, like, absolutely.

5090
03:32:32,550 --> 03:32:37,170
And I think that's probably why people dislike Rand so much,

5091
03:32:37,170 --> 03:32:40,350
is they feel like she's giving license to the bad side

5092
03:32:40,350 --> 03:32:42,150
and she's saying, "It's okay to be selfish."

5093
03:32:42,150 --> 03:32:45,723
You know, they feel like she's unloosing the dark forces.

5094
03:32:47,850 --> 03:32:50,760
And, you know, in some cases, that may be true,

5095
03:32:50,760 --> 03:32:54,270
but she's also unloosing some of the light forces

5096
03:32:54,270 --> 03:32:57,600
in terms of reflecting on yourself and trying to be true.

5097
03:32:57,600 --> 03:33:00,765
But definitely there are ideas that are dangerous

5098
03:33:00,765 --> 03:33:03,240
to play with, and there are ideas that I think give license

5099
03:33:03,240 --> 03:33:06,183
to the darker sides of human nature.

5100
03:33:07,950 --> 03:33:11,340
But I think you can see that in the historical record.

5101
03:33:11,340 --> 03:33:15,930
So I think that it's possible to show that.

5102
03:33:15,930 --> 03:33:18,900
And obviously, there's some places, like Germany,

5103
03:33:18,900 --> 03:33:19,980
they think the ideas are

5104
03:33:19,980 --> 03:33:22,560
so dangerous they can't be allowed to circulate.

5105
03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:24,990
And in some contexts, that may absolutely be true.

5106
03:33:24,990 --> 03:33:27,570
- And then still,

5107
03:33:27,570 --> 03:33:29,670
even that we should take with a grain of salt,

5108
03:33:29,670 --> 03:33:31,020
because perhaps censorship

5109
03:33:31,020 --> 03:33:33,030
of an idea is more dangerous than the idea.

5110
03:33:33,030 --> 03:33:36,540
So all of that, that's the beautiful thing about us humans,

5111
03:33:36,540 --> 03:33:39,510
we are always at tension,

5112
03:33:39,510 --> 03:33:40,800
trying to figure out what ideas are the ones

5113
03:33:40,800 --> 03:33:45,090
that are going to help humanity flourish.

5114
03:33:45,090 --> 03:33:46,260
Pothead question.

5115
03:33:46,260 --> 03:33:47,340
- [Jennifer] Yeah. (chuckles)

5116
03:33:47,340 --> 03:33:50,730
- (chuckles) Do humans have ideas, or do ideas have us?

5117
03:33:50,730 --> 03:33:52,110
So where do ideas come from?

5118
03:33:52,110 --> 03:33:53,640
You have Milton Friedman sitting there

5119
03:33:53,640 --> 03:33:56,190
after Rutgers trying to figure out what he can do

5120
03:33:56,190 --> 03:33:57,540
about the Great Depression.

5121
03:34:00,707 --> 03:34:02,157
Do you ever think about this?

5122
03:34:03,120 --> 03:34:05,130
I sometimes think that ideas are,

5123
03:34:05,130 --> 03:34:06,690
aliens are actually ideas.

5124
03:34:06,690 --> 03:34:10,440
They're just kind of like travel through human brains

5125
03:34:10,440 --> 03:34:15,440
and captivate us, and we get all real excited.

5126
03:34:17,820 --> 03:34:21,420
Like with the monolith in "2001: A Space Odyssey,"

5127
03:34:21,420 --> 03:34:24,420
a monolith lands, and everybody gets excited,

5128
03:34:24,420 --> 03:34:28,290
and somehow this idea just gets everybody

5129
03:34:28,290 --> 03:34:29,910
to be on the same page,

5130
03:34:29,910 --> 03:34:32,850
and it reverberates through the community,

5131
03:34:32,850 --> 03:34:34,500
and then that results

5132
03:34:34,500 --> 03:34:37,440
in an implementation of some action that results

5133
03:34:37,440 --> 03:34:39,780
in us figuring out that that idea was actually bad

5134
03:34:39,780 --> 03:34:41,730
and we learn new ideas.

5135
03:34:41,730 --> 03:34:44,280
But it feels like the idea is running the show.

5136
03:34:44,280 --> 03:34:46,560
- Yeah, I mean, I think in a lot of cases,

5137
03:34:46,560 --> 03:34:47,790
I think it's true.

5138
03:34:47,790 --> 03:34:50,197
You know, Keynes has this famous quote like, you know,

5139
03:34:50,197 --> 03:34:53,713
"Most men are slaves of some defunct economist," you know?

5140
03:34:53,713 --> 03:34:56,550
- (chuckles) That's funny, that's funny.

5141
03:34:56,550 --> 03:34:59,610
- So I do think that it's really hard

5142
03:34:59,610 --> 03:35:01,050
to have an original thought.

5143
03:35:01,050 --> 03:35:02,640
You know, we are social creatures.

5144
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:05,340
We encounter the same situations again and again.

5145
03:35:05,340 --> 03:35:07,500
And so it's really hard.

5146
03:35:07,500 --> 03:35:09,477
You're born into these traditions of thinking

5147
03:35:09,477 --> 03:35:11,400
and being and knowing,

5148
03:35:11,400 --> 03:35:13,530
and most people are never going to question them,

5149
03:35:13,530 --> 03:35:15,720
and most people are never going to become aware of them.

5150
03:35:15,720 --> 03:35:18,060
So again, that's some of the work of what I do

5151
03:35:18,060 --> 03:35:21,180
as an intellectual historian is like, let's become aware.

5152
03:35:21,180 --> 03:35:23,130
Let's realize that you're carrying a map

5153
03:35:23,130 --> 03:35:26,520
that's orienting you to the world in a certain way.

5154
03:35:26,520 --> 03:35:29,760
And so I think you have to work really,

5155
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:31,620
really hard to have an original idea.

5156
03:35:31,620 --> 03:35:34,860
And even then, it's not a completely original idea.

5157
03:35:34,860 --> 03:35:36,030
It's a reworking

5158
03:35:36,030 --> 03:35:38,640
and a reassembling of ideas others have had.

5159
03:35:38,640 --> 03:35:42,480
So I definitely think it's possible to create autonomy

5160
03:35:42,480 --> 03:35:43,770
in the realm of ideas

5161
03:35:43,770 --> 03:35:46,530
and to be an autonomous consumer of ideas.

5162
03:35:46,530 --> 03:35:50,670
But I think on balance, most people are not,

5163
03:35:50,670 --> 03:35:51,503
and that's fine.

5164
03:35:51,503 --> 03:35:52,590
They want to have experiences,

5165
03:35:52,590 --> 03:35:55,170
they want to do other things with their life, you know.

5166
03:35:55,170 --> 03:35:56,220
- Well, Jennifer,

5167
03:35:56,220 --> 03:35:58,830
thank you so much for this journey through ideas today.

5168
03:35:58,830 --> 03:36:01,530
And thank you so much for your incredible work.

5169
03:36:01,530 --> 03:36:04,787
It was really fun and fascinating to talk with you today.

5170
03:36:04,787 --> 03:36:05,620
Thank you.

5171
03:36:05,620 --> 03:36:07,200
- Thank you.

5172
03:36:07,200 --> 03:36:08,250
- Thank you for listening

5173
03:36:08,250 --> 03:36:11,400
to this conversation with Jennifer Burns.

5174
03:36:11,400 --> 03:36:13,650
And now let me try to reflect on

5175
03:36:13,650 --> 03:36:16,770
and articulate some things I've been thinking about.

5176
03:36:16,770 --> 03:36:18,270
If you'd like to submit questions

5177
03:36:18,270 --> 03:36:22,200
or topics that I can comment on in this way here

5178
03:36:22,200 --> 03:36:26,280
at the end of episodes, go to lexfridman.com/ama

5179
03:36:26,280 --> 03:36:29,670
or contact me for whatever other reason

5180
03:36:29,670 --> 03:36:33,120
at lexfridman.com/contact.

5181
03:36:33,120 --> 03:36:34,860
Please allow me to say a few words

5182
03:36:34,860 --> 03:36:37,590
about my interview with the President of Ukraine,

5183
03:36:37,590 --> 03:36:39,270
Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

5184
03:36:39,270 --> 03:36:41,730
Now that a few days have passed

5185
03:36:41,730 --> 03:36:43,050
and I've had the chance to think

5186
03:36:43,050 --> 03:36:45,960
about the conversation itself, the response,

5187
03:36:45,960 --> 03:36:48,060
future upcoming conversations,

5188
03:36:48,060 --> 03:36:50,790
and what it all means for the war in Ukraine,

5189
03:36:50,790 --> 03:36:52,890
for global geopolitics,

5190
03:36:52,890 --> 03:36:55,530
and for us humans in general,

5191
03:36:55,530 --> 03:36:57,120
I've gotten a lot of heartfelt,

5192
03:36:57,120 --> 03:36:59,070
positive words from all sides,

5193
03:36:59,070 --> 03:37:01,410
including, at least so far,

5194
03:37:01,410 --> 03:37:05,040
literally everybody who knows me personally inside Ukraine,

5195
03:37:05,040 --> 03:37:06,930
which includes a lot of soldiers

5196
03:37:06,930 --> 03:37:09,090
and many high-profile figures,

5197
03:37:09,090 --> 03:37:11,490
some who are supportive of the president,

5198
03:37:11,490 --> 03:37:13,140
and some who are critical of him.

5199
03:37:13,980 --> 03:37:16,080
Literally all private communication

5200
03:37:16,080 --> 03:37:18,150
has been positive and supportive.

5201
03:37:18,150 --> 03:37:20,370
This is usually not the case with me.

5202
03:37:20,370 --> 03:37:22,980
Friends usually will write to me to criticize

5203
03:37:22,980 --> 03:37:24,690
and to disagree.

5204
03:37:24,690 --> 03:37:27,210
That's the whole point of friendship,

5205
03:37:27,210 --> 03:37:30,270
to argue and have fun doing it.

5206
03:37:30,270 --> 03:37:32,763
There was none of that here, at least so far.

5207
03:37:33,600 --> 03:37:36,600
So thank you for your support and kind words.

5208
03:37:36,600 --> 03:37:37,713
It means the world.

5209
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:42,093
The most common message was please keep pushing for peace.

5210
03:37:43,140 --> 03:37:43,973
I will.

5211
03:37:45,360 --> 03:37:47,970
But online, on the interwebs,

5212
03:37:47,970 --> 03:37:49,890
I saw a lot of attacks,

5213
03:37:49,890 --> 03:37:51,990
sometimes from swarms of online accounts,

5214
03:37:51,990 --> 03:37:54,180
which of course makes me suspicious

5215
03:37:54,180 --> 03:37:55,923
about the origin of those attacks.

5216
03:37:57,180 --> 03:37:58,560
One of my friends in Ukraine,

5217
03:37:58,560 --> 03:38:01,320
who by the way thinks the attacks are all propped up

5218
03:38:01,320 --> 03:38:03,697
by Ukrainian bot farms, said,

5219
03:38:03,697 --> 03:38:06,990
"There's no need to say anything extra.

5220
03:38:06,990 --> 03:38:09,570
Let the interview stand on its own.

5221
03:38:09,570 --> 03:38:12,320
Just keep focused on the mission of pushing for peace."

5222
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:16,680
Basically, he's a Ukrainian version of my other friend,

5223
03:38:16,680 --> 03:38:18,967
Joe Rogan, who to this day says,

5224
03:38:18,967 --> 03:38:20,880
"Don't read the comments."

5225
03:38:20,880 --> 03:38:22,440
This is generally good advice,

5226
03:38:22,440 --> 03:38:24,150
and I try to follow it,

5227
03:38:24,150 --> 03:38:25,710
but I'm also a human being.

5228
03:38:25,710 --> 03:38:27,420
I wear my heart on my sleeve.

5229
03:38:27,420 --> 03:38:32,420
And this interview, this war for me is deeply personal,

5230
03:38:32,460 --> 03:38:35,610
and the level of vitriol, misrepresentation,

5231
03:38:35,610 --> 03:38:37,800
and lies about the conversation

5232
03:38:37,800 --> 03:38:40,860
and about me personally was particularly intense

5233
03:38:40,860 --> 03:38:42,480
and disingenuous.

5234
03:38:42,480 --> 03:38:44,160
So I thought I would use this opportunity

5235
03:38:44,160 --> 03:38:47,190
to say a few words, just speak a bit more

5236
03:38:47,190 --> 03:38:49,110
about how I approach this conversation

5237
03:38:49,110 --> 03:38:52,980
with President Zelenskyy and conversations in general.

5238
03:38:52,980 --> 03:38:55,170
This interview is something I poured my heart

5239
03:38:55,170 --> 03:38:58,860
and soul into, preparing a lot.

5240
03:38:58,860 --> 03:39:01,710
I've described parts of the preparation process I follow

5241
03:39:01,710 --> 03:39:04,260
in the outro to the Zelenskyy conversation.

5242
03:39:04,260 --> 03:39:07,530
But in general, let me say that I've read a lot,

5243
03:39:07,530 --> 03:39:08,760
listened to a lot,

5244
03:39:08,760 --> 03:39:10,740
and had a lot of private conversations

5245
03:39:10,740 --> 03:39:12,720
with people on the ground.

5246
03:39:12,720 --> 03:39:15,510
I have many flaws, but being unprepared

5247
03:39:15,510 --> 03:39:18,003
for this conversation is not one of them.

5248
03:39:19,020 --> 03:39:21,390
Two low-effort attacks got to me a bit,

5249
03:39:21,390 --> 03:39:22,950
if I'm being honest,

5250
03:39:22,950 --> 03:39:25,923
though I am learning to take it all in stride.

5251
03:39:26,790 --> 03:39:31,653
First attack is that I'm unprepared, uninformed, or naive.

5252
03:39:32,670 --> 03:39:34,650
I don't give a damn about the trolls,

5253
03:39:34,650 --> 03:39:38,250
but I want people who listen to me, who support me,

5254
03:39:38,250 --> 03:39:39,480
who care about my words,

5255
03:39:39,480 --> 03:39:41,880
to know that this is not the case.

5256
03:39:41,880 --> 03:39:45,120
It never will be the case for future conversations,

5257
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:48,450
especially ones of this importance.

5258
03:39:48,450 --> 03:39:50,853
I work extremely hard to prepare.

5259
03:39:52,110 --> 03:39:55,620
Second, low-effort attack that got to me a bit

5260
03:39:55,620 --> 03:39:57,390
is that I'm a shill for Zelenskyy

5261
03:39:57,390 --> 03:39:59,580
or a shill for Putin.

5262
03:39:59,580 --> 03:40:02,100
Both accusations were hurled readily

5263
03:40:02,100 --> 03:40:05,460
and freely by the online mob of all persuasions,

5264
03:40:05,460 --> 03:40:09,150
by the left and the right in the United States and Europe,

5265
03:40:09,150 --> 03:40:12,330
by the pro and the anti-Zelenskyy people in Ukraine

5266
03:40:12,330 --> 03:40:14,100
or of Ukrainian origins,

5267
03:40:14,100 --> 03:40:17,790
and by the pro and anti-Putin people in Russia

5268
03:40:17,790 --> 03:40:19,533
or of Russian origins.

5269
03:40:20,700 --> 03:40:22,820
As I've said over and over,

5270
03:40:22,820 --> 03:40:24,387
this is not the case,

5271
03:40:24,387 --> 03:40:26,730
and will never be the case.

5272
03:40:26,730 --> 03:40:28,680
I'm a shill for no one.

5273
03:40:28,680 --> 03:40:31,320
More than that, I just simply refuse to be caught

5274
03:40:31,320 --> 03:40:33,810
in any one single echo chamber.

5275
03:40:33,810 --> 03:40:35,580
It's an ongoing battle, of course,

5276
03:40:35,580 --> 03:40:37,320
because social media algorithms

5277
03:40:37,320 --> 03:40:39,120
and the various dogmatic groups

5278
03:40:39,120 --> 03:40:42,510
and tribes out there want to pull you in

5279
03:40:42,510 --> 03:40:44,910
to their warm embrace of belonging,

5280
03:40:44,910 --> 03:40:48,240
and humans want to belong.

5281
03:40:48,240 --> 03:40:50,700
But the cost of the path I have chosen

5282
03:40:50,700 --> 03:40:54,180
is that I will never belong to any one group.

5283
03:40:54,180 --> 03:40:56,970
In the end, like many of us must,

5284
03:40:56,970 --> 03:40:58,503
I walk alone.

5285
03:40:59,730 --> 03:41:02,700
And I try to do my best to do what is right

5286
03:41:02,700 --> 03:41:05,310
to my independent heart and mind,

5287
03:41:05,310 --> 03:41:08,550
not what is popular with any one group.

5288
03:41:08,550 --> 03:41:11,340
My goals for this conversation were two-fold.

5289
03:41:11,340 --> 03:41:13,440
First, give a large platform

5290
03:41:13,440 --> 03:41:16,980
to President Zelenskyy to explain his perspective on the war

5291
03:41:16,980 --> 03:41:20,250
and to do so in a way that brings out the best in who he is

5292
03:41:20,250 --> 03:41:21,933
as a leader and human being.

5293
03:41:22,950 --> 03:41:25,830
Second goal was to push for peace

5294
03:41:25,830 --> 03:41:28,110
and to give him every opportunity possible

5295
03:41:28,110 --> 03:41:30,720
to signal that he is ready to make peace

5296
03:41:30,720 --> 03:41:33,813
and to provide his vision for what that might look like.

5297
03:41:34,670 --> 03:41:36,060
And just to be clear,

5298
03:41:36,060 --> 03:41:38,610
by peace I mean long-lasting peace

5299
03:41:38,610 --> 03:41:41,130
that minimizes suffering of people in the region

5300
03:41:41,130 --> 03:41:44,670
and maximizes the flourishing of humanity

5301
03:41:44,670 --> 03:41:46,053
in the coming decades.

5302
03:41:47,310 --> 03:41:51,420
The war in Ukraine has led to over 1 million casualties

5303
03:41:51,420 --> 03:41:53,373
and growing every single day.

5304
03:41:54,420 --> 03:41:57,300
For some people torn apart by loss,

5305
03:41:57,300 --> 03:42:00,570
tormented and forced into a state of anger and hate,

5306
03:42:00,570 --> 03:42:02,973
peace is a dirty word.

5307
03:42:03,870 --> 03:42:08,163
To them, nothing less than justice must be accepted.

5308
03:42:09,990 --> 03:42:11,970
I hear this pain.

5309
03:42:11,970 --> 03:42:14,583
I've seen the bodies and the suffering.

5310
03:42:15,960 --> 03:42:20,130
It's true, peace will not bring back your loved ones,

5311
03:42:20,130 --> 03:42:23,130
but it will prevent further slaughter of more people,

5312
03:42:23,130 --> 03:42:26,043
each of whom are someone else's loved ones.

5313
03:42:27,420 --> 03:42:30,330
So again, the second goal of this conversation

5314
03:42:30,330 --> 03:42:33,093
was to push for this kind of peace.

5315
03:42:35,550 --> 03:42:37,650
So how did I approach it?

5316
03:42:37,650 --> 03:42:40,020
Every conversation is its own puzzle,

5317
03:42:40,020 --> 03:42:42,520
so let me try to explain my approach for this one.

5318
03:42:43,440 --> 03:42:46,290
As I've said, I read and listened to a lot of material

5319
03:42:46,290 --> 03:42:49,560
since February 24, 2022.

5320
03:42:49,560 --> 03:42:50,640
There would be many weeks

5321
03:42:50,640 --> 03:42:53,790
over the past three years where I would spend every day,

5322
03:42:53,790 --> 03:42:58,680
over eight hours a day of focused reading and research.

5323
03:42:58,680 --> 03:43:00,420
There were several rabbit holes

5324
03:43:00,420 --> 03:43:03,570
that I consistently returned to and researched,

5325
03:43:03,570 --> 03:43:05,220
but the most important line of inquiry

5326
03:43:05,220 --> 03:43:07,170
was always peace talks,

5327
03:43:07,170 --> 03:43:08,340
not just in this war,

5328
03:43:08,340 --> 03:43:11,043
but in other wars in modern history.

5329
03:43:12,060 --> 03:43:13,590
For this specific war,

5330
03:43:13,590 --> 03:43:15,690
as part of the background prep,

5331
03:43:15,690 --> 03:43:16,523
I would take notes

5332
03:43:16,523 --> 03:43:18,780
on every single perspective I could find

5333
03:43:18,780 --> 03:43:20,880
on every single major diplomatic meeting

5334
03:43:20,880 --> 03:43:23,010
and negotiation that happened

5335
03:43:23,010 --> 03:43:26,613
in Ukraine-Russia relations since 1991.

5336
03:43:27,780 --> 03:43:30,120
There is a lot of material to go through,

5337
03:43:30,120 --> 03:43:32,700
and there are a lot of perspectives

5338
03:43:32,700 --> 03:43:36,090
even on the very 2019 meeting

5339
03:43:36,090 --> 03:43:39,120
that President Zelenskyy spoke about in this podcast.

5340
03:43:39,120 --> 03:43:41,640
Just as a small but important example,

5341
03:43:41,640 --> 03:43:45,420
Andriy Bohdan was interviewed twice by Dmytro Gordon

5342
03:43:45,420 --> 03:43:47,790
and gave a deep inside look

5343
03:43:47,790 --> 03:43:49,890
of the administration of President Zelenskyy,

5344
03:43:49,890 --> 03:43:52,860
including that very 2019 meeting.

5345
03:43:52,860 --> 03:43:56,640
The two interviews are seven and a half hours by the way,

5346
03:43:56,640 --> 03:43:59,460
and from my interviewer perspective

5347
03:43:59,460 --> 03:44:01,623
are a masterclass of interviewing.

5348
03:44:03,030 --> 03:44:06,030
Andriy Bohdan worked directly with President Zelenskyy

5349
03:44:06,030 --> 03:44:09,030
as the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.

5350
03:44:09,030 --> 03:44:11,820
He was there for the 2019 face-to-face meeting

5351
03:44:11,820 --> 03:44:13,470
between Volodymyr Zelenskyy

5352
03:44:13,470 --> 03:44:16,410
and Vladimir Putin at the Paris summit,

5353
03:44:16,410 --> 03:44:19,380
along with French President Emmanuel Macron

5354
03:44:19,380 --> 03:44:22,350
and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

5355
03:44:22,350 --> 03:44:25,623
This was part of the Normandy format peace talks.

5356
03:44:26,700 --> 03:44:28,110
In those two interviews,

5357
03:44:28,110 --> 03:44:31,320
Andriy Bohdan gave a very different perspective

5358
03:44:31,320 --> 03:44:34,950
on that 2019 meeting than did President Zelenskyy

5359
03:44:34,950 --> 03:44:36,783
to me in our conversation,

5360
03:44:37,680 --> 03:44:39,630
the perspective being that the failure

5361
03:44:39,630 --> 03:44:41,400
to negotiate a ceasefire

5362
03:44:41,400 --> 03:44:44,763
and peace was not a simple one-sided story.

5363
03:44:46,140 --> 03:44:47,490
I don't think this is the right time

5364
03:44:47,490 --> 03:44:51,600
for me to dive into that data point and be critical.

5365
03:44:51,600 --> 03:44:53,010
I'm not interested in being critical

5366
03:44:53,010 --> 03:44:54,900
for the sake of criticism.

5367
03:44:54,900 --> 03:44:58,860
I am interested once again in productive conversations,

5368
03:44:58,860 --> 03:45:02,283
critical or otherwise, that push towards peace,

5369
03:45:03,210 --> 03:45:04,773
the kind I described earlier.

5370
03:45:05,790 --> 03:45:06,990
This is merely an example

5371
03:45:06,990 --> 03:45:09,240
of a data point I was collecting in my brain.

5372
03:45:09,240 --> 03:45:11,670
There are many, many others,

5373
03:45:11,670 --> 03:45:15,417
but all of it taken together made it clear to me,

5374
03:45:15,417 --> 03:45:17,370
and I still believe this,

5375
03:45:17,370 --> 03:45:19,950
that it is indeed very difficult

5376
03:45:19,950 --> 03:45:23,880
but possible to negotiate long-lasting peace

5377
03:45:23,880 --> 03:45:25,233
with Vladimir Putin.

5378
03:45:26,120 --> 03:45:29,220
It is certainly true that Ukraine is best positioned

5379
03:45:29,220 --> 03:45:32,280
to negotiate from a place of strength.

5380
03:45:32,280 --> 03:45:35,640
After the invasion of February 24th, 2022,

5381
03:45:35,640 --> 03:45:38,100
I believe there were three chances

5382
03:45:38,100 --> 03:45:40,860
where peace was most achievable.

5383
03:45:40,860 --> 03:45:43,980
First chance was March and April of 2022

5384
03:45:43,980 --> 03:45:45,930
with a successful defense of the North.

5385
03:45:46,800 --> 03:45:50,370
Second chance was the fall of 2022

5386
03:45:50,370 --> 03:45:52,410
with the successful counteroffensive

5387
03:45:52,410 --> 03:45:54,720
in Kherson and Kharkiv.

5388
03:45:54,720 --> 03:45:56,493
The third chance is now.

5389
03:45:57,510 --> 03:45:59,670
As he has stated multiple times publicly,

5390
03:45:59,670 --> 03:46:02,540
Donald Trump is very interested in making peace.

5391
03:46:02,540 --> 03:46:05,340
It is likely that the US financial support

5392
03:46:05,340 --> 03:46:08,070
for this war will continue to dwindle.

5393
03:46:08,070 --> 03:46:12,093
So the leverage and the timing for peace negotiation is now.

5394
03:46:13,110 --> 03:46:16,110
There is unlikely to be another chance like this

5395
03:46:16,110 --> 03:46:17,493
for a long time.

5396
03:46:18,480 --> 03:46:22,020
Just to zoom out on the conversation piece of this,

5397
03:46:22,020 --> 03:46:25,650
I interviewed Donald Trump and may do so again.

5398
03:46:25,650 --> 03:46:28,770
I interviewed Volodymyr Zelenskyy and may do so again.

5399
03:46:28,770 --> 03:46:32,460
And it seems likely that I will interview Vladimir Putin

5400
03:46:32,460 --> 03:46:34,623
in Russia, in the Kremlin.

5401
03:46:36,450 --> 03:46:38,850
I understand the risks, and I accept them.

5402
03:46:38,850 --> 03:46:40,740
The risks for me are not important.

5403
03:46:40,740 --> 03:46:42,180
I'm not important.

5404
03:46:42,180 --> 03:46:45,210
I merely want to do my small part in pushing for peace

5405
03:46:45,210 --> 03:46:48,750
in a moment in history when there's a real chance

5406
03:46:48,750 --> 03:46:51,063
for that peace to actually be achieved.

5407
03:46:52,860 --> 03:46:55,140
I may be speaking too long, I'm sorry,

5408
03:46:55,140 --> 03:46:57,210
but I can probably speak for many more hours,

5409
03:46:57,210 --> 03:46:59,523
so this is in fact me trying to be brief.

5410
03:47:00,450 --> 03:47:03,450
So again, my two goals were to bring out the best

5411
03:47:03,450 --> 03:47:06,690
in President Zelenskyy as a leader and a human being,

5412
03:47:06,690 --> 03:47:09,060
and to give him every opportunity possible

5413
03:47:09,060 --> 03:47:11,910
to signal that he is ready to make peace

5414
03:47:11,910 --> 03:47:13,530
and to lay out his vision

5415
03:47:13,530 --> 03:47:15,840
for what that peace might look like.

5416
03:47:15,840 --> 03:47:19,920
Like I said, step one through ten is prepare well.

5417
03:47:19,920 --> 03:47:24,780
I did, but step eleven is the actual conversation.

5418
03:47:24,780 --> 03:47:27,870
There the specific psychological and personality quirks

5419
03:47:27,870 --> 03:47:30,120
and qualities of the guest matter a lot.

5420
03:47:30,120 --> 03:47:32,190
My job is to try to cut through the bullshit walls

5421
03:47:32,190 --> 03:47:33,750
we put up as human beings

5422
03:47:33,750 --> 03:47:36,750
and reveal, directly or indirectly,

5423
03:47:36,750 --> 03:47:39,990
who the person truly is and how they think.

5424
03:47:39,990 --> 03:47:43,560
With Zelenskyy, he is a deeply empathic

5425
03:47:43,560 --> 03:47:47,430
and emotional human being who personally feels the suffering

5426
03:47:47,430 --> 03:47:49,740
of the people of Ukraine in this war.

5427
03:47:49,740 --> 03:47:54,330
This is a strength and perhaps also a weakness.

5428
03:47:54,330 --> 03:47:55,950
But it is an important part

5429
03:47:55,950 --> 03:47:58,470
of the reason why I said many times

5430
03:47:58,470 --> 03:48:00,963
that he is a truly historic figure.

5431
03:48:02,070 --> 03:48:04,020
Very few leaders in recent history

5432
03:48:04,020 --> 03:48:06,210
would be able to pull off what he did

5433
03:48:06,210 --> 03:48:09,030
to stay in Kyiv, to unite the country,

5434
03:48:09,030 --> 03:48:09,960
to convince the West

5435
03:48:09,960 --> 03:48:12,843
to join the war effort to the degree they did.

5436
03:48:14,190 --> 03:48:15,900
He is also a showman,

5437
03:48:15,900 --> 03:48:19,140
to borrow the title of the biography I recommended,

5438
03:48:19,140 --> 03:48:22,290
a man with many layers of humor and wit,

5439
03:48:22,290 --> 03:48:25,620
but also ego and temper,

5440
03:48:25,620 --> 03:48:27,750
sometimes fully self-aware

5441
03:48:27,750 --> 03:48:29,520
and sometimes losing himself

5442
03:48:29,520 --> 03:48:32,400
in the emotional rollercoaster of a painful memory

5443
03:48:32,400 --> 03:48:36,420
or a turn of phrase that he can use as a springboard

5444
03:48:36,420 --> 03:48:38,823
for an angry soliloquy.

5445
03:48:39,930 --> 03:48:42,990
Add to this the fact that we didn't agree to anything,

5446
03:48:42,990 --> 03:48:44,280
what we will talk about,

5447
03:48:44,280 --> 03:48:47,310
or how long we will talk about it.

5448
03:48:47,310 --> 03:48:49,590
The interview could have easily been five minutes

5449
03:48:49,590 --> 03:48:51,030
or three hours.

5450
03:48:51,030 --> 03:48:54,480
So I had to quickly gain his trust enough to open up

5451
03:48:54,480 --> 03:48:57,240
and stay for a long form conversation,

5452
03:48:57,240 --> 03:48:59,910
but push him enough to reveal the complexities

5453
03:48:59,910 --> 03:49:03,690
of his thought process and his situation.

5454
03:49:03,690 --> 03:49:06,510
This is where humor and camaraderie was essential,

5455
03:49:06,510 --> 03:49:08,280
and I would return to it often,

5456
03:49:08,280 --> 03:49:10,920
though it was very difficult given the stakes,

5457
03:49:10,920 --> 03:49:14,253
the heaviness, the seriousness of the topic of the war.

5458
03:49:15,270 --> 03:49:17,370
So in this case, the approach I followed

5459
03:49:17,370 --> 03:49:19,230
for this conversation is constant nudges

5460
03:49:19,230 --> 03:49:21,210
and questions about peace,

5461
03:49:21,210 --> 03:49:25,500
often using almost childlike statements or questions.

5462
03:49:25,500 --> 03:49:27,930
I generally like these kinds of questions.

5463
03:49:27,930 --> 03:49:31,620
On the surface, they may seem naive, but they're not.

5464
03:49:31,620 --> 03:49:34,350
They are often profound in their simplicity,

5465
03:49:34,350 --> 03:49:36,603
like a lot of questions that children ask.

5466
03:49:37,440 --> 03:49:40,143
Remember, it was a child who pointed out

5467
03:49:40,143 --> 03:49:42,573
that the emperor was not wearing any clothes.

5468
03:49:43,460 --> 03:49:45,270
I like the simplicity, the purity,

5469
03:49:45,270 --> 03:49:46,650
the boldness of such questions

5470
03:49:46,650 --> 03:49:49,023
to cut through the bullshit to the truth.

5471
03:49:49,950 --> 03:49:52,950
And that truth is that hundreds of thousands of people

5472
03:49:52,950 --> 03:49:56,253
died in this war and are dying every day.

5473
03:49:57,360 --> 03:49:59,070
And all the other problems,

5474
03:49:59,070 --> 03:50:02,940
from corruption to suspended elections to censorship,

5475
03:50:02,940 --> 03:50:05,103
cannot be solved until peace is made.

5476
03:50:06,270 --> 03:50:08,760
I give the president every single chance

5477
03:50:08,760 --> 03:50:11,310
to signal willingness to negotiate,

5478
03:50:11,310 --> 03:50:12,750
knowing that both Trump

5479
03:50:12,750 --> 03:50:15,363
and Putin will listen to this conversation.

5480
03:50:16,470 --> 03:50:18,060
I don't think he took it,

5481
03:50:18,060 --> 03:50:21,000
and instead chose to speak very crude words

5482
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:22,263
towards Vladimir Putin.

5483
03:50:23,130 --> 03:50:25,410
This is fully understandable,

5484
03:50:25,410 --> 03:50:28,140
but not directly productive to negotiation.

5485
03:50:28,140 --> 03:50:31,710
To clarify, I have hosted many conversations

5486
03:50:31,710 --> 03:50:34,440
that were intensely critical of Vladimir Putin,

5487
03:50:34,440 --> 03:50:37,440
from Serhii Plokhy to Stephen Kotkin,

5488
03:50:37,440 --> 03:50:40,140
but this conversation is with a world leader

5489
03:50:40,140 --> 03:50:42,270
speaking about another world leader

5490
03:50:42,270 --> 03:50:46,260
during a historic opportunity for peace.

5491
03:50:46,260 --> 03:50:49,530
Crude words of disrespect, while powerful,

5492
03:50:49,530 --> 03:50:51,273
may harm negotiations.

5493
03:50:52,410 --> 03:50:56,130
Peacemaking in this situation requires compromise

5494
03:50:56,130 --> 03:50:59,550
in order to avoid further death and suffering.

5495
03:50:59,550 --> 03:51:02,310
And I believe it requires treating the other leader

5496
03:51:02,310 --> 03:51:05,643
with the seriousness you expect him to treat you with.

5497
03:51:06,540 --> 03:51:08,193
This is what I was pushing for.

5498
03:51:09,300 --> 03:51:11,670
All that, while also putting my ego aside

5499
03:51:11,670 --> 03:51:13,380
and letting the president shine,

5500
03:51:13,380 --> 03:51:16,470
which is necessary to accomplish both goals one

5501
03:51:16,470 --> 03:51:18,810
and two that I mentioned previously.

5502
03:51:18,810 --> 03:51:21,060
This is also why I wanted the president

5503
03:51:21,060 --> 03:51:23,130
to speak about Elon and Trump,

5504
03:51:23,130 --> 03:51:24,540
to extend the olive branch

5505
03:51:24,540 --> 03:51:26,970
for further avenues of peacemaking.

5506
03:51:26,970 --> 03:51:28,710
This is not about politics.

5507
03:51:28,710 --> 03:51:31,833
It is once again simply about peace.

5508
03:51:32,940 --> 03:51:35,610
Now, all of this, my words, my attempts,

5509
03:51:35,610 --> 03:51:37,050
were taken out of context

5510
03:51:37,050 --> 03:51:40,590
and used to attack me by some online mobs.

5511
03:51:40,590 --> 03:51:44,220
As an example, President Zelenskyy said in a mocking tone

5512
03:51:44,220 --> 03:51:46,710
that he thinks that Vladimir Putin is simply irritated

5513
03:51:46,710 --> 03:51:50,160
by people who are alive in Ukraine.

5514
03:51:50,160 --> 03:51:52,807
And I answered, quote,

5515
03:51:52,807 --> 03:51:54,270
"If you believe this,

5516
03:51:54,270 --> 03:51:56,700
it will be very difficult to negotiate.

5517
03:51:56,700 --> 03:51:57,780
If you think that the president

5518
03:51:57,780 --> 03:51:59,760
of a country is completely crazy,

5519
03:51:59,760 --> 03:52:03,870
it is really hard to come to an agreement with him.

5520
03:52:03,870 --> 03:52:04,980
You have to look at him

5521
03:52:04,980 --> 03:52:08,160
as a serious person who loves his country

5522
03:52:08,160 --> 03:52:10,680
and loves the people in his country,

5523
03:52:10,680 --> 03:52:12,180
and he conducts, yes,

5524
03:52:12,180 --> 03:52:14,307
destructive military actions."

5525
03:52:15,510 --> 03:52:18,487
The president interrupted me at this point and said,

5526
03:52:18,487 --> 03:52:20,640
"Who are you talking about now?

5527
03:52:20,640 --> 03:52:22,680
Who loves this country?"

5528
03:52:22,680 --> 03:52:25,200
And I said, "Putin.

5529
03:52:25,200 --> 03:52:27,570
Do you think he doesn't love his country?"

5530
03:52:27,570 --> 03:52:29,787
And the president answered, "No."

5531
03:52:30,960 --> 03:52:33,690
Again, this is not a podcast conversation

5532
03:52:33,690 --> 03:52:35,580
with a historian or activist,

5533
03:52:35,580 --> 03:52:38,160
and I somehow out of nowhere, just for fun,

5534
03:52:38,160 --> 03:52:40,380
waxed poetic about Putin's,

5535
03:52:40,380 --> 03:52:43,443
or Zelenskyy's, or Trump's love of nation.

5536
03:52:44,310 --> 03:52:47,430
It is a conversation with a world leader

5537
03:52:47,430 --> 03:52:49,440
discussing the opportunity

5538
03:52:49,440 --> 03:52:52,170
to negotiate peace when a large number

5539
03:52:52,170 --> 03:52:54,333
of people are dying every single day.

5540
03:52:56,100 --> 03:52:58,800
Even if the heart boils over with hate,

5541
03:52:58,800 --> 03:53:02,310
leadership now requires sitting at the negotiation table

5542
03:53:02,310 --> 03:53:03,810
and compromising.

5543
03:53:03,810 --> 03:53:06,483
This may be painful, but it is necessary.

5544
03:53:07,350 --> 03:53:08,700
There are a few other places

5545
03:53:08,700 --> 03:53:09,533
in the conversation

5546
03:53:09,533 --> 03:53:12,480
where some online mobs took my words out of context

5547
03:53:12,480 --> 03:53:14,790
and used them to call me naive

5548
03:53:14,790 --> 03:53:16,830
and to call for more war,

5549
03:53:16,830 --> 03:53:19,260
saying peace is impossible with a man

5550
03:53:19,260 --> 03:53:21,560
who they claim is the second coming of Hitler.

5551
03:53:23,280 --> 03:53:27,570
My friends, if you make such attacks on this conversation,

5552
03:53:27,570 --> 03:53:30,480
it is in fact you who are naive

5553
03:53:30,480 --> 03:53:33,903
and ignorant of the facts of history and geopolitics.

5554
03:53:35,220 --> 03:53:39,270
Peace must be made now in order for death

5555
03:53:39,270 --> 03:53:41,160
and suffering to stop,

5556
03:53:41,160 --> 03:53:44,070
in order for Ukraine to have a chance to flourish,

5557
03:53:44,070 --> 03:53:48,123
and in order for the drums of a global war to stop beating,

5558
03:53:49,200 --> 03:53:51,873
a global war that would cripple humanity.

5559
03:53:53,490 --> 03:53:56,430
This was my goal, once again,

5560
03:53:56,430 --> 03:53:57,693
to push for peace,

5561
03:53:58,920 --> 03:54:01,820
and I will continue this effort to the best of my ability.

5562
03:54:02,880 --> 03:54:04,080
Thank you.

5563
03:54:04,080 --> 03:54:04,953
I love you all.
