1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,733
- A crazy thing in the kidnap business.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,143
We used to get asked by FBI leadership,

3
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:10,230
"When is this gonna be over?"

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,063
And the answer would be,

5
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:12,000
"When the bad guys feel

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,980
like they've gotten everything they can."

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,650
Now dissecting that statement,

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,830
you're talking about when they feel

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,270
like they got everything they can.

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,230
So the key to kidnapping negotiations are the feelings.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,063
They're the bad guys.

12
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:28,803
We're talking about feelings, kidnapper's feelings,

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,250
which drives everything.

14
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,383
Doesn't matter what human endeavor it is.

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,810
- The following is a conversation with Chris Voss,

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,020
former FBI hostage and crisis negotiator

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,440
and author of, "Never Split the Difference:

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,560
Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It."

22
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,533
And now, dear friends, here's Chris Voss.

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,820
What is it like negotiating for a hostage with a kidnapper?

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,920
What is the toughest part of that process?

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,890
- The toughest part is, if it looks bad

26
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,840
from the beginning,

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,690
and you gotta engage in the process anyway.

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,510
- What are the factors that make it bad?

29
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,770
That makes you nervous?

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,270
That, if you were to observe a situation

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,800
where there's general negotiation,

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,543
or it's a hostage negotiation,

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,130
what makes you think that this is going to be difficult?

34
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,870
- If they wanna make it look like they're negotiating,

35
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,965
but they're not.

36
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,873
Like in the 2004 timeframe,

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,450
Al-Qaeda in Iraq was executing people on camera

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,490
for the publicity,

39
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,220
and they wanted to make it look like they were negotiating.

40
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,117
So they'd come on and they say,

41
00:01:43,117 --> 00:01:45,330
"If you don't get all the women out of,

42
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,960
Iraqi women out of the jails in Iraq in 72 hours,

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,367
we're gonna kill a hostage."

44
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,380
That was one of the demands

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,990
in one of the cases in that timeframe.

46
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,637
Now, first of all, even if we'd have been willing,

47
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,050
the US government, the coalition,

48
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,160
would've been willing to do that,

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,130
it wouldn't have been able to happen in 72 hours.

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,803
So it was an impossible ask from the beginning.

51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,800
And so then that looks really bad.

52
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,330
Like they're trying to make it,

53
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,289
they're trying to make it look

54
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,680
like they're talking reasonably, but they're not.

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,720
So your hostage is in bad shape there.

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,600
They've made a demand that you just,

57
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,793
even if you wanted to do, you couldn't do.

58
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,970
So then what makes that very difficult is,

59
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,533
in kidnappings especially,

60
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,170
you're working with family members,

61
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,760
you're coaching people,

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,580
bad guys are in touch with family members,

63
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,620
or if they're not directly in touch with family members,

64
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,140
the other thing that Al-Qaeda was doing

65
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,510
at that time was they didn't give us a way to talk to 'em.

66
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,210
They're making statements in the media,

67
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,913
but then not leaving their phone number, if you will.

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,733
So that's one more thing.

69
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,410
Like they're intentionally blocking you.

70
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,140
They're asking you to do something you can't do.

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,420
They're not giving you a way to talk to 'em.

72
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,460
So you gotta get with the family

73
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,720
and discuss with the family

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,860
how you're gonna approach things.

75
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,697
Now the family definitely wants to know,

76
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,010
"Is this gonna help?"

77
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,220
There was a bunch of cases like that in that timeframe.

78
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,117
And you gotta be honest with 'em,

79
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,310
"It's a long shot.

80
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,560
Our chances here are slim and none."

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
And when it's slim and none, I'll take slim,

82
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,030
but it's still very, very slim.

83
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,470
And there were a number of people that were killed

84
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,260
in that timeframe before the tide finally got turned.

85
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,400
And it was,

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,410
it was hard dealing with families at the time.

87
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,090
- Can you negotiate in public

88
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,070
versus like a direct channel in private?

89
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,280
- Oh yeah. Bad guys picked the media.

90
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,050
They're making statements in the media.

91
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,553
So, and that's a big clue.

92
00:03:33,698 --> 00:03:37,200
Their channel of choice tells you an awful lot.

93
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,870
And if they're choosing the media,

94
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,660
then that means there's people they're trying to appeal to.

95
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,830
That means, in their view,

96
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,300
there's such a thing as good media.

97
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,190
So if there's good media, there's bad media.

98
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,600
How do you make it bad?

99
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,890
And we made it bad for 'em.

100
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,650
It just, unfortunately it had to go through a number

101
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,710
of iterations before they got the message and quit.

102
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,690
- In that negotiation,

103
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,160
do you think about the value of human life?

104
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,270
Is there a dollar figure?

105
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,320
Is there, how do you enumerate, not enumerate,

106
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,150
quantify the value of human life?

107
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,940
- Yeah, that's, it's like beauty.

108
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,310
It's in the eye of the beholder.

109
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,670
So that was the first lesson on any hostage negotiation.

110
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,320
Really any negotiation.

111
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,970
Like it doesn't matter what it is to you,

112
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,410
matters what it is to the other side.

113
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,960
One of the things, especially in your conversation

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,553
I listened to with Andrew.

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,130
By the way, you guys,

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,950
another thing I really liked about that conversation,

117
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,690
first of all, I think the world of him.

118
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,800
- [Lex] Andrew Huberman.

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,210
- Yeah, Andrew Huberman.

120
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,700
And you released it on my birthday,

121
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,810
I appreciate that. (Lex chuckles)

122
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,980
It was a nice birthday present-

123
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,240
- [Lex] I tried to time it perfectly just for you.

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,653
- Yeah, nice job. Thank you.

125
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,350
But empathy is in the eye of the beholder

126
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,700
in every negotiation.

127
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,450
Whether it's over a car, a house,

128
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,360
collaboration in your company, with the bad guys.

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,640
How does the other side see it?

130
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,795
Now the nice thing about kidnapping for ransom,

131
00:05:02,795 --> 00:05:04,307
if there's an actual ransom demand

132
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:06,213
that's an actual demand,

133
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:10,200
is it's a mercenaries business.

134
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,630
They're gonna take what they could get.

135
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,480
And they tend to be really good

136
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,330
at figuring out how much money somebody has.

137
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,330
So, and again, I'll keep drawing business analogies.

138
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,070
You're looking for a job with an employer.

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,520
There's a market price of the job,

140
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,870
and then there's what the employer can pay you.

141
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,520
Now, maybe the market price of the job,

142
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,793
market's 150 grand, employer can pay 120.

143
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,830
But it's a great job.

144
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,833
You know, we were talking about Elon a minute ago.

145
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,660
Like, I'd work minimum wage to follow him around.

146
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,043
You know, that would be worth it.

147
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:53,070
More the value other than the dollars.

148
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,620
And how hard is it to get the dollars?

149
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,723
And how quickly can you get to them?

150
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,780
These are all things that the bad guys are good,

151
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,550
in kidnapping, are good at figuring out.

152
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,840
So the value of human life to them

153
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,740
is gonna be what can they get?

154
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,293
A crazy thing in the kidnap business.

155
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,643
We used to get asked by FBI leadership,

156
00:06:15,787 --> 00:06:17,760
"When is this gonna be over?"

157
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,593
And the answer would be,

158
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:19,530
"When the bad guys feel

159
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,510
like they've gotten everything they can."

160
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,180
Now dissecting that statement,

161
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,360
you're talking about when they feel

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
like they got everything they can.

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,760
So the key to kidnapping negotiations are the feelings.

164
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,593
They're the bad guys.

165
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,303
We're talking about feelings, kidnapper's feelings,

166
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,750
which drives everything.

167
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,720
Doesn't matter what human endeavor it is.

168
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,263
- So it's not reason, it's emotion.

169
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,385
- There's no such thing as reason. (chuckles)

170
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:53,040
- (laughs) I should say for a little bit of context,

171
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,980
I just talked yesterday

172
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,560
with a guy named Sam Harris.

173
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,970
I don't know if you know Sam,

174
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,940
but Sam, and because I was preparing

175
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,800
for a conversation with you,

176
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,220
I talked to him about empathy versus reason

177
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,040
and he lands heavily on reason.

178
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Empathy is somewhere between useless

179
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,420
and erroneous and leads you astray

180
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,860
and is not effective.

181
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,400
That reason is the only way forward.

182
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,110
- Well, let's draw some fine lines there.

183
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,080
And the two fine lines I would draw is,

184
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,820
first, what is your definition of empathy?

185
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,723
And then secondly,

186
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,190
how do people actually make up their minds?

187
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,150
And I'm gonna flip it.

188
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,890
I'm gonna go with how people make up their minds.

189
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,560
You make up your mind based on what you care about.

190
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,393
Period.

191
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,160
That makes reason emotion based.

192
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,993
What do you care about?

193
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:49,920
You start with what you care about.

194
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,330
You see some guy swimming out in off the coast of the ocean

195
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,940
and you see a shark coming up behind him.

196
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,190
Who are you cheering for?

197
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,320
If it's Adolf Hitler out there,

198
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,430
you're cheering for the shark.

199
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,990
You might actually feel bad for the shark,

200
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,733
'cause it's gonna taste bad.

201
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,550
Who do you care about?

202
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,110
- You mean the human will taste bad? (laughs)

203
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,420
- Yeah, you know, if he eats Adolf Hitler,

204
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,580
you know, it's gonna leave a bad taste in your mouth,

205
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,020
even if you're a shark.

206
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,390
So you're making up your mind on every circumstances

207
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,070
based on what you care about.

208
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,960
So then what does that do to reason?

209
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,010
Your reason is based on

210
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,870
what you care about from the beginning.

211
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,013
Now then empathy.

212
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,740
If you define it as sympathy,

213
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,299
which it was never meant to be sympathy, ever.

214
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,133
You know,

215
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,169
etymology, I think is the word.

216
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,750
I keep getting etymology and entomology mixed up.

217
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,090
Etymology being right, you know,

218
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,039
where words came from, the origin.

219
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,332
Entomology being bugs.

220
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:47,850
- [Lex] (laughs) Got it.

221
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,640
- Right? So I like etymology.

222
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,110
Where did something come from?

223
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,340
I also like entomology.

224
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,083
Anyway, etymology.

225
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,353
My understanding from my research,

226
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,800
the original definition of empathy

227
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,470
was an interpretation of a German word,

228
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,730
where people were trying to figure out

229
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,440
what the artist was trying to convey.

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,260
It was about assessing art.

231
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,210
And so it was always about understanding

232
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,470
where somebody was coming from,

233
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:18,470
but not sharing necessarily that same thing.

234
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,890
So then when I was with the FBI

235
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,220
and I first started collaborating with Harvard,

236
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,700
Bob Mnookin wrote a book "Beyond Winning,"

237
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,533
second chapter is,

238
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,907
"The Tension Between Empathy and Assertiveness."

239
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,323
Still the best chapter on empathy I've ever read anywhere.

240
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,020
And Bob writes in his book.

241
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,360
Bob was the head of the program on negotiation.

242
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,380
He's also agreed to be interviewed for a documentary

243
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,800
about me and my company that hasn't been released yet,

244
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,660
but it should be released sometime this year.

245
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,927
- [Lex] What's the name of the documentary?

246
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,230
- "Tactical Empathy."

247
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,130
- [Lex] Good name.

248
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,187
- So Bob's definition of empathy, he said,

249
00:09:57,187 --> 00:10:02,187
"Not agreeing or even liking the other side."

250
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,780
Don't even gotta like 'em,

251
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,710
don't gotta agree with 'em.

252
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:08,730
Just straight understanding where they're coming from

253
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,720
and articulating it,

254
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,733
which requires no agreement whatsoever.

255
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,300
That becomes a very powerful tool,

256
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,800
like ridiculously powerful.

257
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,560
And if it, if sympathy or compassion

258
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,360
or agreement are not included,

259
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,740
you can be empathic with anybody.

260
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,280
I was thinking about this

261
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,590
when I was getting ready to sit down and talk to you,

262
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,490
'cause you use the word empathy a lot.

263
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,633
Putin.

264
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:37,680
I can be empathic with Putin easy. It's easy.

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,840
I don't agree with where he is coming from.

266
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,173
I don't agree with his methodology.

267
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,970
Early on, Ukraine/Russian war,

268
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,513
I saw an article that was very dismissive of Russia.

269
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,917
That said, "Russia's basically Europe's gas station."

270
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,470
And I thought, "All right."

271
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,180
So if you are in charge

272
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,310
and the way you feed your people

273
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,830
is via an industry

274
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,083
that the entire world is trying to quit.

275
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,970
The whole world is trying to get out of fossil fuels.

276
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,920
If that's how you feed your people,

277
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,170
if you don't come up with an answer to that,

278
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,150
the people that you've taken a responsibility for

279
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,150
are gonna die alone in the cold, in the dark.

280
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,300
They're gonna freeze and they're gonna die.

281
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,860
Right, so that doesn't mean that I agree

282
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,100
with where he is coming from or any of his means,

283
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,460
but where is, how does this guy see things

284
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,883
in his distorted war?

285
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,820
You're never gonna get through to somebody like that

286
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,100
in a conversation unless you can demonstrate to them

287
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,450
you understand where they're coming from.

288
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,773
Whether or not you agree.

289
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,590
Early '90s, last century.

290
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,290
I'm a last century guy, I'm an old dude,

291
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,750
refer to myself as a last century guy.

292
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,283
Also a deeply flawed human.

293
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,413
So terrorist case, New York City,

294
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,050
civilian court.

295
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,710
Terrorism does not have to be tried in military tribunals.

296
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,040
That's a very bad idea. It was always bad.

297
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,663
The FBI was always against it.

298
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,113
I'm getting ready.

299
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:15,360
We have Muslims testifying in open court

300
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,510
against a legitimate Muslim cleric.

301
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,050
The guy that was on trial had the credentials

302
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,730
as a legitimate Muslim cleric.

303
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,100
The people that were testifying against him

304
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,840
didn't think he should be advocating murder

305
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,790
of innocent people.

306
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,053
We'd sit down with them, Arab Muslims, Egyptians mostly.

307
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,117
And I would say to them,

308
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:39,600
"You believe that there's been a succession

309
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,850
of American governments for the last 200 years

310
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,437
that are anti-Islamic?"

311
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,350
And they shake their head and go, "Yeah."

312
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,000
And that'd be the start of the conversation.

313
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,710
That's empathy.

314
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,020
You believe this to be the case.

315
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,100
I never said I agreed.

316
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,453
I never said I disagreed,

317
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,960
but I showed 'em that I wasn't afraid of their beliefs.

318
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,480
I was so unafraid of 'em that I was willing

319
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,140
to just state 'em and not disagree or contradict.

320
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,340
'Cause I would say that

321
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,920
and then I'd shut up and let 'em react.

322
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,950
And I never had to say, "Here's why you're wrong."

323
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,990
I never gave my point of view.

324
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,420
Every single one of 'em that testified. That's empathy.

325
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,420
Not agreeing with where the other side is coming from.

326
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,090
I'm not sure how Sam would de define it,

327
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,480
but common vernacular is its sympathy and its compassion.

328
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,850
And that's when it becomes useless.

329
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,780
- And there is a gray area, maybe you can comment on it,

330
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,010
is sometimes a drop of compassion

331
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,250
helps make that empathy more effective in the conversation.

332
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,023
So you're just saying you believe X,

333
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:53,160
doesn't quite form a strong of a bond with the other person.

334
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,200
- You are imagining it doesn't.

335
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,040
- Maybe you're right, yes,

336
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,240
I'm imagining it doesn't.

337
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,463
I'm imagining you need to show

338
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,443
that you're on the same side.

339
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,190
That you need to signal a little bit

340
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,480
about your actual beliefs,

341
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,010
at least in that moment.

342
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,332
Even if those, that signaling is a,

343
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:14,160
is not as deep as it sounds,

344
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
but at first, you know,

345
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,347
basically patting the person on the back and saying,

346
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:18,870
"We're on the same side, brother."

347
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,333
- You know, that's what most people,

348
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,500
when they're really learning the concept,

349
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,680
that's the basic human reaction.

350
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,130
And in application,

351
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,683
especially in highly adversarial situations,

352
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,820
like, I need a regular guy,

353
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,897
Muslim, but how's that guy gonna say

354
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:45,450
"Buy it, if I like, you know,

355
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,550
dude, I'm on your side.

356
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,070
I've been there, I feel you."

357
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,273
No, no, no, no, no, no.

358
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,720
People get conned by that so much.

359
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,850
Like, if we're on opposite sides of the table

360
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,640
and I try to act like I'm not on the opposite side

361
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,933
of the table, that makes me disingenuous.

362
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,280
So I would rather be honest.

363
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,233
You know, my currency is integrity.

364
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,327
And at some point in time, if you go like,

365
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,850
"You know where I'm coming from?"

366
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,020
My answer's gonna be like,

367
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,473
look, I can agree on maybe where we're going,

368
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,200
but if we're talking about, you know,

369
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,180
am I on your side now?

370
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,910
As a human being, I wanna see you survive and thrive.

371
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,680
Not at my expense.

372
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,430
I think the world is full of opportunity.

373
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,990
I'm optimistic.

374
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,020
I got more than enough reason for saying that.

375
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,770
There's enough here for both of us.

376
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,090
So I got no problem with you getting yours.

377
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,014
You know, just don't take it outta my hide

378
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:45,600
and I'm gonna be honest about it.

379
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
About both of those things,

380
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,170
I'm not interested in you taking it outta my hide.

381
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,090
I think there's plenty here for both of us.

382
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,130
Now, I don't need to be on your side

383
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,820
except in a human sense.

384
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,653
But I don't,

385
00:15:57,653 --> 00:15:59,370
do I have to side with you over the war?

386
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:03,990
No. Or how we're distributing the stock?

387
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,640
Or how much you get paid,

388
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,163
or how much you make off this car.

389
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,220
I think people,

390
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,100
my experience as a layman

391
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,430
is that empathy's not got a downside.

392
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,520
That you don't need me to act

393
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,640
like I'm on your side for us to make a great deal.

394
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,280
- Great deal. Well, we'll talk about two things.

395
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,803
A great deal and a great conversation.

396
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,760
They're often going to be the same thing,

397
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,860
but at times they're going to be different.

398
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,470
And that's a, you mentioned Vladimir Putin.

399
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,077
There is some zoom level at which you do wanna say,

400
00:16:41,077 --> 00:16:42,570
"We're on the same side."

401
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,910
You said the human level.

402
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,260
It's possible to say,

403
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,550
kind of zoom out and say that we're all in this together.

404
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,840
Not we Slavic people, we Europeans,

405
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,710
but we human beings.

406
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,670
- We're on the same planet. - Same planet, right.

407
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,690
- Several years ago,

408
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:05,520
and his name is evidently been mud now,

409
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,930
but he was very nice to me,

410
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,690
a lawyer here in town named Tom Girardi.

411
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,290
And no shortage of bad reporting on him now,

412
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,170
I have absolutely no idea if any of it's true.

413
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,060
I do know that in my interaction with him,

414
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,760
he was always a gentleman to me and was very generous.

415
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,780
When he'd get into conversations with people,

416
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,807
he'd always say like, you know,

417
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:28,593
"Let's look at 10 years from now,

418
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,853
where we could both be in a phenomenal place together.

419
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,272
Now let's work our way back from there."

420
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:38,460
- (laughs) That's a good line.

421
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,570
- Yeah, and then, you know,

422
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,480
I saw him do it in simulations.

423
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,770
I was teaching a USC, we were at a function together,

424
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,980
and a gentleman at the time told me who he was,

425
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,870
and that he was really influential.

426
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,467
So I walked up to the guy cold and I said,

427
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:54,870
"Hey, you know, how about coming

428
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,457
to talk in my class at USC?"

429
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,950
He didn't know me other than the fact

430
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,900
that we had a mutual acquaintance,

431
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,853
and he graciously consented to come in.

432
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,820
And he said, "What do you want me to talk about?"

433
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,120
I said, "Look, dude, just from your success here,

434
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,790
it doesn't matter what you talk about.

435
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,440
You know, either I'm gonna agree

436
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,210
or I'm gonna disagree or I'm gonna learn from it.

437
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,160
My students are gonna learn from it."

438
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,900
So students wanna role play with 'em, you know,

439
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,760
they dispute, you know, "Let's do a negotiation."

440
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,860
Every single time he'd go to "Pick a point in the future

441
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,463
where we're both happy.

442
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,840
10 years, 20 years from now, and let's work our way back."

443
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,243
Now, hostage negotiator, same thing.

444
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,830
I call into a bank, bad guy picks up on the,

445
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,123
picks up on the phone,

446
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,747
and I'm gonna say, "I want you to live."

447
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,730
You know, "I wanna see you survive this, you know,

448
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,410
whatever else goes with that.

449
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,360
Let's pick a point in the future

450
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,773
that we're both good with.

451
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,320
And then we work our way back."

452
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,480
And people make also,

453
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,860
we were talking before about emotion

454
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,420
and what you care about.

455
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,590
People make their decisions

456
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,900
based on their vision of the future.

457
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,433
Like without question.

458
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,950
I think there's a Hindu temple in the United States,

459
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,230
being, has been, or being assembled,

460
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,600
same way that the Hindu temples were in India

461
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
a thousand years ago by hand.

462
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,173
Volunteers, by hand.

463
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,950
These people are knocking themselves out

464
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,320
for a place in paradise, a vision of the future.

465
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,000
What you will go through today

466
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,980
if the future portends what you want,

467
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,350
you'll go through incredible things today.

468
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,900
So it's a vision of the future.

469
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,080
- So you have to try to paint a vision of the future

470
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,830
that the person you're negotiating with will like.

471
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,030
Which is tough to do.

472
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,670
- It's find out what their vision of the future is

473
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,073
and then remove yourself as a threat.

474
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,630
You know, if we can collaborate together at all.

475
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,580
If you think that I could do anything at all

476
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,300
to help you to that point and, you know,

477
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,010
integrity's my currency,

478
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,030
I'm not gonna lie to you.

479
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,620
Which gets back before,

480
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,900
did I lie to you about whether or not I'm on your side?

481
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,520
You know, right now, at the moment

482
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,070
we're on opposite sides of the fence.

483
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,340
That's not gonna stop us from being together in the future.

484
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,667
Inside you're gonna say,

485
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,850
"Wow, well, you didn't lie to me about today.

486
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,950
Maybe you won't lie to me about tomorrow."

487
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,490
- So going back to world leaders, for example,

488
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,780
whether it's Volodymyr Zelenskyy or Vladimir Putin,

489
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,430
you don't think it closes off their mind

490
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,243
to show that you have a different opinion.

491
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,930
- Depending upon when you showed it.

492
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,030
Are you arguing from the beginning

493
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,370
or are you displaying understanding from the beginning?

494
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,220
I don't think it stops you from being adversarial.

495
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,493
That was the thing about Mnookin's,

496
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,613
the chapter in his book,

497
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:52,287
"The Tension Between Empathy and Assertiveness."

498
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,780
I remember reading that,

499
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,847
reading that name of the chapter, thinking like,

500
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:02,847
"Eh, you know, in my business there is no tension."

501
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:06,007
And then I got into it and I read, I thought,

502
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:08,160
"This is a red herring."

503
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,840
He's drawing people in

504
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,060
because his entire chapter is

505
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,720
that empathy puts you in a position to assert

506
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,580
and that there is no tension.

507
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,993
It's a sequencing issue.

508
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,000
And that's why, again, I think it's,

509
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,980
it was written for lawyers.

510
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,600
- Yeah, sequencing issue.

511
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,040
The timing is everything.

512
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,520
So you emphasize the importance of,

513
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,870
in terms of sequencing and priority of listening,

514
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,420
of truly listening to the other person.

515
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,024
- I'm sorry, what'd you say?

516
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,503
That was a bad joke, sorry. - I forgot.

517
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,903
Your timing is just perfect.

518
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,170
How do you listen?

519
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,270
How do you truly listen to another human being?

520
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,170
How do you notice them?

521
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,570
How do you really hear them?

522
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,150
- I always hated the term active listening.

523
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,013
If anything, it's proactive.

524
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,610
And as soon as you start to try and anticipate

525
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,910
where somebody's going, you're dialed in more.

526
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,970
Because along the way,

527
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,330
either you're congratulating yourself for being right,

528
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,720
or, when suddenly they say something that surprises you,

529
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,770
you really notice it.

530
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,780
Like, "That's not what I expected."

531
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,460
You're dialed in, you're listening.

532
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,160
So it's proactive.

533
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,670
And then one of the reasons, you know,

534
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,527
we named the book "Tactical Empathy."

535
00:22:27,143 --> 00:22:28,320
Named the book "Never Split the Difference,"

536
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,453
but we're talking about tactical empathy.

537
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,490
Calibrated emotional intelligence.

538
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,260
What's it calibrated by?

539
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,570
First it was experience as host negotiators,

540
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,130
but then we'd come to find out

541
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,080
that our experience as host negotiators

542
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,330
is backed up by neuroscience.

543
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,350
Another reason why I listen

544
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,270
to Andrew Huberman's podcasts all the time.

545
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,620
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy on the neuroscience.

546
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,030
And so then emotional intelligence calibrated

547
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,440
by what we know about neuroscience.

548
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,030
What do we know about neuroscience?

549
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,070
And I'll talk about it from a layman's perspective,

550
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,650
and to even say we is an arrogant thing,

551
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,330
you know, human beings.

552
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,370
I didn't do the research.

553
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,150
I'm scooping up as much of it as I can as a layman.

554
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,623
The brain's largely negative.

555
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
I think there's ample evidence.

556
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,697
People would argue with you as to what the wiring is

557
00:23:20,697 --> 00:23:22,890
and what does what,

558
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,950
and the limbic system and all of that.

559
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,910
But the brain is basically 75% negative.

560
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,440
As is in a layman I make that contention.

561
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,590
Number one. Number two.

562
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,000
The best way to deactivate negativity

563
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,173
is by calling it out.

564
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,100
And I could say, "Look, I don't want you to be offended

565
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,200
by what I'm getting ready to say."

566
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,550
That's a denial.

567
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,760
Your guard is up, you're getting ready to get mad.

568
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,250
If I say, "What I'm getting ready to say

569
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,750
is probably gonna offend you."

570
00:23:51,836 --> 00:23:54,487
Then you relax a little bit and you go,

571
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,250
"All right, what is it?"

572
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,987
And then I say it, whatever it is.

573
00:23:57,987 --> 00:24:00,637
And you're gonna be like, "Oh, that wasn't that bad."

574
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,680
Because we knew from hostage negotiation

575
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,100
by calling out the negativity it deactivated it,

576
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,380
and then, a number of neuroscience experiments

577
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,520
have been done right and left,

578
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,553
by calling out negativity, deactivating the negativity.

579
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,220
- Calling out ahead of time.

580
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,970
So like acknowledging that this is,

581
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:24,360
that this is ahead of time, that this is going to hurt.

582
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,990
- The experiments that I've seen

583
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,340
have been when the negativity was inflicted

584
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,890
and then having a person that it was being inflicted upon

585
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,330
simply identify it.

586
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,350
- [Lex] Just identify?

587
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,190
- Yeah, what are you feeling?

588
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,263
I'm angry. And the anger goes away.

589
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,900
- It's tough because I've had a few,

590
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,640
and again, we're dancing between things,

591
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,490
but I've had a few conversations

592
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,183
where anger arose in the guests I spoke with.

593
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,223
And I'm not sure identifying it,

594
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,770
that's like leaning into it and going into the depths,

595
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:05,943
'cause that's going into the depths of some emotional,

596
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,750
psychological thing they're going through

597
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,880
that I'm not sure I wanna explore

598
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,073
that iceberg with the little ship we got.

599
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:17,580
You have to decide,

600
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,730
do you want to avoid it

601
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,020
or do you wanna lean into it?

602
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,121
It's a tough choice.

603
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:23,990
- It's the elephant in the room.

604
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,910
- It is an elephant in the room.

605
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,430
It is an elephant.

606
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,040
Especially when, I think that's the big difference

607
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,220
between conversations and negotiations.

608
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,700
Negotiation ultimately is looking for closure

609
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,540
and resolution.

610
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,540
I think general conversations like this is more exploring.

611
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,790
There's not necessarily a goal.

612
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,990
Like if you were to put,

613
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,510
like, if I had to put a goal for this conversation,

614
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,370
there's no real goal.

615
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,670
It's curiously exploring ideas.

616
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:57,963
So that'll, gives you freedom to not call out the elephant.

617
00:25:57,963 --> 00:25:59,917
(chuckles) For a time you can be like,

618
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,260
"All right, let's go to the next room,

619
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,940
get a snack and come back to the elephant.

620
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,130
- Right. All right.

621
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,660
So I'd make a tiny adjustment on the negotiation definition.

622
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,407
'Cause you said, I think, "Seeking closure."

623
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,660
You used two words, and closure was one of them.

624
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,010
- Goal was maybe another.

625
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,990
Well, yeah, what is negotiation?

626
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,090
- Well, I would say seeking collaboration.

627
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,060
And, 'cause closure kind of puts

628
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,340
a little bit of a finality to it, and the real problem

629
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,623
in any negotiation's always implementation.

630
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,230
That's why we say, "Yes is,"

631
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,957
I say, "Yes is nothing without how."

632
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,120
And yes at it's very best is only a temporary aspiration.

633
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,110
It's aspirational.

634
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,940
It's usually counterfeit.

635
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,057
So if you're looking for-

636
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:47,100
(Lex laughs) Huh?

637
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,060
- That's a good line.

638
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,260
Yes is usually counterfeit.

639
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,170
It's aspirational without the how.

640
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,040
It's just a good line, yeah. (laughs)

641
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,900
- Thank you. I've been working on it.

642
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,850
I was practicing in front of the mirror

643
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,375
before coming in today. - You're pretty good.

644
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,630
(both laughing)

645
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,480
You got a bright future ahead of you.

646
00:27:04,267 --> 00:27:05,933
You should write a book or something.

647
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,520
(Lex laughing)

648
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,590
Your book is excellent, by the way.

649
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,970
- Thanks. Appreciate that.

650
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,560
What am I doing here anyway?

651
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,820
- This? On earth?

652
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,484
In general? - With you?

653
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:17,454
- I don't know.

654
00:27:17,454 --> 00:27:20,220
(Chris laughing) We're collaborating.

655
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,630
- Why me though?

656
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:23,670
Why'd you wanna talk to me?

657
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,710
- I've heard you speak in a few places.

658
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,167
I was like, "This is a fascinating human."

659
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,217
I think on Clubhouse and different places,

660
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:34,500
and I listened to some YouTube stuff.

661
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,690
And this is just,

662
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,480
you meet people that are interesting.

663
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,780
That's what I love doing with this podcast,

664
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,680
is just exploring the mind of an interesting person.

665
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,130
You notice people- - Thanks.

666
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,580
- Sometimes there's like a homeless person,

667
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,770
that's outside of 7-Eleven, I notice,

668
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,603
who are you?

669
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:54,570
- [Chris] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

670
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,403
- It's fascinating.

671
00:27:55,403 --> 00:27:57,120
It doesn't, like, I don't look at the resumes

672
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,590
and the credentials and stuff like that.

673
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,960
It's just being able to notice the person.

674
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,580
- As I've been leafing through

675
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,473
the different choices of the podcast,

676
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,021
the young lady that,

677
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:10,620
OnlyFans and the sex workers.

678
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,000
That's a fascinating human being.

679
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
- Yeah, it's fascinating. - Like I wanna know

680
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,170
what makes that person tick 1,000%.

681
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,730
- The fascinating thing about her

682
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,210
is her worldview is almost entirely different than mine.

683
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,430
And that's always interesting to talk to a person

684
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,270
who just is happy, flourishing,

685
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,760
but sees the world, and the set of values she has

686
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,963
is completely different,

687
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:34,620
and is also not argumentative,

688
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,710
is accepting of other worldviews.

689
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,880
It's beautiful to explore that.

690
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,830
- Yeah, no kidding, I would agree.

691
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,090
And then, yeah, thought provoking.

692
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,383
'Cause I consider myself,

693
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,120
the word I was looking for before is abundant.

694
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,710
I think it's an abundant world.

695
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,363
So I'm pretty optimistic.

696
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,640
I consider myself,

697
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,220
I don't know happy exactly describes it, but yeah,

698
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,090
you know I'm.

699
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:00,030
So then if I'm happy, optimistic, abundant,

700
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,713
I got a worldview and then you run into somebody

701
00:29:01,713 --> 00:29:03,750
that has a vastly different worldview

702
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,810
and they're happy and they think it's abundant too.

703
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,910
And you're like, "What is going on in your head,

704
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,190
or mine, or what am I missing?"

705
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,420
Yes. That's fascinating.

706
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,620
- And the pie grows.

707
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,870
Which is useful for kinda negotiation

708
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:18,210
when you paint a picture of a future,

709
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,310
if you're optimistic about that future,

710
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:23,910
there's a kinda feeling, like we're both gonna win here.

711
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,900
- Exactly. - And that's easy.

712
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,940
We'll live in a world where both people can win.

713
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,130
- Yeah. And in point of fact, that's the case.

714
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,073
Although a lot of people want us to think otherwise.

715
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,890
Mostly because of the negativity

716
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,330
that I was talking about before.

717
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,700
- So the brain is generally cynical.

718
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,863
- Yeah, my description of it is,

719
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,550
the pessimistic caveman survived

720
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,650
and we're descendants of the pessimists.

721
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,549
The optimistic guy got eaten by a saber-toothed tiger.

722
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:52,530
- (chuckles) Yeah, but on the flip side,

723
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,880
the optimists seem to be the ones

724
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,890
that actually build stuff these days.

725
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,910
- There's a switch.

726
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,870
Like, so at what point in time do we catch on?

727
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,820
'Cause the difference between survival and success mindset.

728
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,193
The success mindset is highly optimistic.

729
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
So where do we switch or how do we stay switched

730
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,160
from survival to success?

731
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,333
That's the challenge.

732
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,540
- Yeah, somewhere we stopped being eaten

733
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,360
by saber-toothed tigers and started building bridges

734
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,140
and buildings, and computers and companies, and.

735
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,400
- We started to experience,

736
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,243
we got enough data back to collaborate,

737
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,697
and we stopped listening to our amygdala

738
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,497
and we started listening to our gut.

739
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,220
- Let me just to return briefly to terrorists.

740
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,840
What do you think about the policy

741
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,550
of not negotiating with terrorists?

742
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,250
- Well, that's not the policy, first of all.

743
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,650
Now, everybody thinks that's the policy.

744
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,710
It hasn't been the policy since 2002

745
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,020
when Bush 43 signed

746
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,037
a National Security Presidential Directive, NSPD.

747
00:30:55,037 --> 00:30:57,093
At the time it was NSPD 12,

748
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:03,350
which basically said, "We won't make concessions.

749
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,337
That doesn't mean we won't talk."

750
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,370
So I'm in Columbia at the same time

751
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,220
and I have been intimately involved

752
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,090
with the signing of him signing that document.

753
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,400
I knew exactly what it said,

754
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,913
and he didn't inherit it from somebody else, he signed it.

755
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,120
And I'm in Columbia

756
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,607
and the number two in the embassy says,

757
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:30,690
"Last night on TV, the president of the United States

758
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,670
said we don't negotiate with terrorists.

759
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,150
Are you calling a president of the United States a liar?"

760
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,560
And I remember thinking like, "All right,

761
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:42,180
so he probably said that,

762
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,817
and that's not on the document that he signed."

763
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,610
So I said, "Look, you know,

764
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm familiar with what he signed

765
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,387
and that's not what it says."

766
00:31:52,387 --> 00:31:54,270
"Well, you know." And so the argument.

767
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,467
But that's always been the sound bite that everybody likes.

768
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:58,560
"We don't negotiate with terrorists."

769
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,570
Depends upon your definition of negotiation.

770
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,830
If it's just communication,

771
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,210
we negotiate with 'em all the time.

772
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,683
Number one. And number two.

773
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,540
Like every president has made some boneheaded deal

774
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,473
with the bad guys.

775
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,920
Like Obama released

776
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,120
five high-level Taliban leaders

777
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,680
from Guantanamo in exchange for an AWOL soldier

778
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,870
that we immediately threw in jail.

779
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,411
And I thought that was a horrible deal,

780
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:30,011
and that's putting terrorists back on a battlefield.

781
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,300
And then Trump turned around and topped it

782
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,720
by putting 5,000 terrorists back on the battlefield.

783
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,150
So we haven't had a president that has stuck to that

784
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,650
on either side of the aisle,

785
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,110
since people started throwing that out as a sound bite.

786
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,120
- What do you think of that negotiation?

787
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,700
Forget terrorists, but the global negotiation,

788
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,770
like with Vladimir Putin,

789
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,890
the recent negotiation over prisoners,

790
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:56,040
the exchange, the Brittney Griner.

791
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,440
Is there a way to do that negotiation successfully?

792
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,030
- First of all, I agree with the idea

793
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,252
that she was wrongfully detained

794
00:33:02,252 --> 00:33:04,050
and she didn't deserve to be in jail.

795
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,150
And that US government,

796
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,420
there should be no second class citizens ever.

797
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,450
And whether you're an WNBA player

798
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,160
or you're just some bonehead

799
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,290
that walked into the wrong situation,

800
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,053
your government should not abandon you ever, ever.

801
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,133
Now what they do in the meantime,

802
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,820
there should have been a negotiation.

803
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,160
They were desperate to make a deal at a bad time.

804
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,840
They'd been offered far better deals

805
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,870
than prisoner swaps earlier and turned 'em down.

806
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,640
And then the heat gets turned up,

807
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,470
and thank God for Brittney Griner

808
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,440
that the public got enough attention.

809
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,150
They kept pressure on the administration,

810
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,023
they made a deal.

811
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:47,040
Now if governments wanna make those kind of deals,

812
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,680
that's fine, as long as it,

813
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,260
'cause that was basically a political negotiation.

814
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,963
You're putting 5,000 Taliban back on the battlefield,

815
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,510
that ain't negotiating with another government.

816
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,340
You're putting five of 'em back on the battlefield

817
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,870
that ain't negotiating with another government,

818
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,600
that's directly contradicting this thing that you claimed.

819
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,860
And those were all bad deals.

820
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,320
Now was the Brittney Griner thing a bad deal?

821
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,300
I think it was great for her.

822
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,170
If I was in the middle of it,

823
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,199
it would've been better and she still would've come home.

824
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,870
- Yeah, there's some technical aspects of that negotiation.

825
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,909
What do you think is the value, just to linger on it,

826
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:20,219
of meeting in-person for the negotiation?

827
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,840
- I think it's a great idea.

828
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,530
- Can I just follow that tangent along.

829
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,969
There's a war in Ukraine now.

830
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,072
It's been going on over a year.

831
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,623
It's, for me personally, given my life stories,

832
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,440
is a deeply personal one,

833
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,380
and I'm returning back to that area of the world,

834
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,213
I was there.

835
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,179
Volodymyr Zelenskyy said

836
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,723
he doesn't wanna talk to Vladimir Putin.

837
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,830
Do you think they could get in a room together?

838
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,130
And say you were there

839
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,560
in a room with Putin and Zelenskyy

840
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,190
and Biden is sitting in the back drinking a cocktail,

841
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,443
or maybe he is at the table participating.

842
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,890
Is it possible through negotiation,

843
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,070
through the art of conversation to find peace

844
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,070
in this very tense geopolitical conflict?

845
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,600
- I think it's eminently possible.

846
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,030
I think getting people together in-person

847
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,950
has always been a good idea.

848
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,783
Now how many,

849
00:35:23,783 --> 00:35:25,950
who's getting 'em together under what circumstances

850
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:28,073
and how many times are you getting 'em together?

851
00:35:30,149 --> 00:35:31,620
The documentary, "The Human Factor,"

852
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,780
about the Mid-East peace negotiations

853
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:36,510
mostly through the '90s,

854
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,703
mostly under the Clinton administration,

855
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,893
got kicked off under Bush 41.

856
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,583
And then the documentary continues through Trump,

857
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,730
but just touching basically on it.

858
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,110
But they're getting Arafat

859
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,930
and the different Israeli prime ministers

860
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,880
together in-person.

861
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,280
And these guys did not wanna talk to each other.

862
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,250
And depending upon the prime minister,

863
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,450
you know, the mere thought

864
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:06,423
of being on the same planet with Arafat was offensive.

865
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,940
And they started getting these guys together

866
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,810
in-person regularly and they started seeing each other

867
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,143
as human beings.

868
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,210
And they started realizing

869
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,940
that there was enough room on the planet for 'em

870
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,423
and that people dying was stupid.

871
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,630
And they would slowly work things out

872
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,240
by getting these guys together in-person.

873
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,130
So how long does it take?

874
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,333
Who's hosting it?

875
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,640
But it's a good idea.

876
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,240
- But the skill of achieving that thing

877
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,370
that you talk about a lot, which is empathy.

878
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,460
And I would say in that case, not just empathy,

879
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,580
but empathy plus a bit, you might disagree with this,

880
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,220
but a drop of compassion in there.

881
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,773
- I think compassion, compassion is helpful,

882
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,340
but it's not essential.

883
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,980
Like, if you just know where I'm coming from.

884
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,620
Like, the thought,

885
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,130
the feeling of being understood.

886
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,510
- Yeah, heard and understood. That's powerful.

887
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,850
- It is, yeah, and again,

888
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,640
I know I picked the vast majority of this up

889
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,370
on Andrew's podcast,

890
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,810
but I picked it up in other places.

891
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,893
'Cause early on,

892
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,920
when we were putting the book together,

893
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,903
Tahl Raz, the writer,

894
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,140
my son, uncredited co-author.

895
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,960
So the book's really a collaboration between me,

896
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,627
my son Brandon, and Tahl Raz.

897
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:29,880
And we're driving for that's rights.

898
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,090
You know, when somebody feels like what you've said

899
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,420
is completely their position, they say "That's right."

900
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,790
Not you're right, but that's right.

901
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,650
So Tahl says, "You know,

902
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,820
I think what's happening here

903
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,270
is you're triggering a subtle epiphany in somebody."

904
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,310
So I'm like, "All right, I'll buy that."

905
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,100
So I start looking up the neuroscience

906
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,813
of the feeling of epiphany,

907
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,643
getting a hit of oxytocin and serotonin.

908
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,313
Oxytocin is a bonding drug.

909
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,760
You bond to me, I don't bond to you.

910
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,370
When you feel completely understood by me,

911
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,543
you bond to me.

912
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,413
Then in one of the relationship podcasts

913
00:38:13,413 --> 00:38:16,380
that I'm listening to on Andrew,

914
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,457
it says, "Oxytocin inclines people to tell the truth."

915
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,920
You're more honest.

916
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,870
All right, so you feel deeply understood by me,

917
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:29,013
you bond to me and you start getting more honest with me.

918
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,413
Serotonin, the neurochemical of satisfaction.

919
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:38,703
Epiphany, you feel oxytocin and serotonin.

920
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,980
Being understood.

921
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,990
All right, I got you bonding to me.

922
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,970
I got you being more honest with me

923
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,920
and I got you feeling more satisfied,

924
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,183
so you want less.

925
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,410
What more do you want out of a negotiation?

926
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,580
- Of course there's already,

927
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,480
with leaders and great negotiators,

928
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,830
there's walls built up,

929
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:01,350
defense mechanisms against that, right?

930
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,790
You're resisting,

931
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,380
you're resisting this basic chemistry.

932
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,780
But yes, you should have that.

933
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:09,270
You should work towards that kind of empathy.

934
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:10,620
And I personally believe,

935
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,990
I don't actually understand why,

936
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,580
but I've observed it time and time again,

937
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,080
but getting in a room together

938
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,280
and really talking, whether privately or publicly,

939
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,890
but really talking, and like this,

940
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,200
so I'll comment on this.

941
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,930
So right now this is being recorded

942
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:30,150
and a few folks will hear this,

943
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,310
but when you really do a good job

944
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,300
with this kind of conversation,

945
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,310
you forget there's cameras.

946
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:36,330
And that's much better

947
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,060
than there being even a third person in the room.

948
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,320
But often when world leaders meet there's like press

949
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,540
or there's others in the room.

950
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,200
Like, as you know, man-to-man or man-to-woman,

951
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,830
you have to like meet like in a saloon,

952
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,050
just the two of you and talk.

953
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,660
There's some intimacy and power to that

954
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,100
to achieve the,

955
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,550
if you're also willing to couple that with empathy,

956
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,840
to really hear the other person.

957
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,878
- [Chris] Yeah, yep, yeah.

958
00:40:04,878 --> 00:40:05,711
- I don't know what that is.

959
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:08,250
That's like a deep, deep intimacy that happens.

960
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,843
- And I think there's actually,

961
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,573
'cause we get asked this

962
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:13,050
in The Black Swan Group all the time.

963
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,210
Like, "How do, you know, Zoom?

964
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,590
That's bad.

965
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,150
You know, 'cause you don't have

966
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,960
the same visual feedback on Zoom."

967
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,160
And that's not true.

968
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:23,993
Like you and I,

969
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,650
I see you from the waist up right now.

970
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,870
If we were on Zoom, I'd be looking at you from the waist up.

971
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,356
- I'm not wearing pants, yeah.

972
00:40:29,356 --> 00:40:30,407
(Chris laughs)

973
00:40:30,407 --> 00:40:31,830
For the internet.

974
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,610
I apologize for that.

975
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,144
(Chris laughs)

976
00:40:35,144 --> 00:40:36,610
(chuckles) Sorry. Yeah, yeah.

977
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,853
Yeah, you only see a small portion.

978
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,780
- Usually I, that's usually where I go.

979
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,173
But anyway.

980
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:45,660
- (laughs) I'm glad we both

981
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,083
have a ridiculous sense of humor, I appreciate it.

982
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:51,540
- But what makes this different in-person?

983
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,833
I actually think,

984
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,610
I think there's energy that we're unable,

985
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:59,580
we don't have the instrumentation to define yet.

986
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,020
And I think that there's a feel,

987
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:04,890
I think there's an actual energetic feel that changes.

988
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,660
And just 'cause we don't, again,

989
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,380
just 'cause we can't measure it,

990
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,780
doesn't mean it's not there.

991
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,990
- Yeah, I would love to figure out what that is.

992
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,120
Folks that are working on virtual reality

993
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,100
are trying to figure out what that is.

994
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,740
During the pandemic everybody was on Zoom.

995
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,060
Zoom and Microsoft,

996
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,970
everybody is trying to figure out how do we replicate that.

997
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,010
I'm trying to understand how to replicate that

998
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,740
because it sure is not fun to travel across the world

999
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,220
just to talk to Snowden or Putin or Zelenskyy.

1000
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,770
I'd love to do it over Zoom, but it's not the same.

1001
00:41:38,773 --> 00:41:42,090
It's not the same. - No, it's not the same.

1002
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,950
I'd go in a room with Putin.

1003
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,250
- You would go in a room? - I would, yeah, 1,000%.

1004
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,230
I'd get it that's right out of him.

1005
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,063
- That's right.

1006
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,825
Well, first you would give him a that's right probably.

1007
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:56,160
- Ah, gettin' and givin'. You see.

1008
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,250
And here's the issue that trips everybody up in negotiation.

1009
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,540
The difference between hearing

1010
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,933
and speaking the same words are vastly different.

1011
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,020
And what I'm looking for

1012
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,463
is the responses I'm getting outta you.

1013
00:42:08,463 --> 00:42:11,310
'Cause if you can't first, that's right especially,

1014
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,310
like if you can't appreciate what that really means,

1015
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,440
hearing it is unsatisfying.

1016
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,937
- So those two words are really important to you.

1017
00:42:17,937 --> 00:42:19,623
You talk about this in your book.

1018
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,580
What does that's right mean? Why is it important?

1019
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,200
- Well, it means that what you just heard

1020
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,253
you think is unequivocably the truth.

1021
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:32,370
Like it's dead-on, it hit the target.

1022
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,573
It's a bullseye.

1023
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:37,200
And there's been a topic of discussion,

1024
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,520
especially between my son and I,

1025
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,743
a lot like what happens?

1026
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,250
This oxytocin bonding moment.

1027
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,400
And his contention has always been

1028
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,930
like Donald Trump is the poster child of what it means.

1029
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,990
Because Donald Trump's addressing an audience,

1030
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,910
you know, he's in a debate with Hillary,

1031
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,223
or he's giving a speech someplace,

1032
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,940
and when the people that are devoted to him,

1033
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,610
when they believe that what he's just said

1034
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,763
is completely right, it's insightful.

1035
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,910
They look at him or they look at the TV

1036
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,397
and they go "That's right."

1037
00:43:15,404 --> 00:43:17,460
And it's what people say

1038
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,283
when they're bought-in to what they just heard.

1039
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Now if you're not convinced of the way

1040
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,663
that Donald Trump's followers are bonded to him,

1041
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,920
and he also just like this, in my view,

1042
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,380
destroys the idea of common ground.

1043
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,380
Because when he first started to run for president,

1044
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,460
the pundits all said, "Ah, he's a New Yorker.

1045
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,440
Nobody in the Republican party's gonna like him.

1046
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,200
It's middle America," you know, "it's blue collar,"

1047
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:51,060
you know, "it's regular common folks, factory workers.

1048
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,220
They're not gonna like Trump 'cause he's from New York.

1049
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,800
And he went to Warden, he's an Ivy Leaguer,

1050
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,850
and he's a son of a wealthy real estate mogul.

1051
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:02,610
And he had a million dollars handed to him

1052
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,083
when he got outta college.

1053
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,550
He," you know, "he's born with a silver spoon in his mouth.

1054
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,560
The Rankin-fire Republicans

1055
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,590
are never gonna accept this guy."

1056
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,763
Based on common ground.

1057
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,300
Look how smart that was.

1058
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,370
- Do you think he's a good negotiator?

1059
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,320
Do you think Donald Trump was a good negotiator?

1060
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,783
- No, I think he's a great marketer.

1061
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,320
If you look at his negotiation track record.

1062
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,807
All right, so I started following Donald Trump

1063
00:44:29,807 --> 00:44:32,250
in the '80s when I was in New York.

1064
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:34,140
I'm a last century guy, he's a last century guy.

1065
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,480
We've got mutual acquaintances.

1066
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,460
The minister that married him to Marla Maples

1067
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,700
was a friend of mine, a close friend of mine.

1068
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,170
And in 1998 I threw a fundraiser in his apartment

1069
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,770
at Trump Tower that he attended.

1070
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,260
So no shortage of mutual friends.

1071
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,300
We went to the same church.

1072
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,273
Still have mutual acquaintances, friends.

1073
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,223
And I've watched his track record negotiation history,

1074
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,810
which is exactly his track record with North Korea.

1075
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,400
Where are we with North Korea?

1076
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,800
What was the deal that he made with North Korea?

1077
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,110
See, your answer is the same as everybody else's.

1078
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:20,430
Well, I remember it started out with a lot of fanfare.

1079
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,190
But I don't know what happened,

1080
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,840
'cause nothing ever happens.

1081
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,430
- There's more public fanfare,

1082
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,800
so marketing-minded presentation-

1083
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,330
- Starts out with a bang.

1084
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:32,670
If he doesn't cut the deal in a short period,

1085
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:35,790
a really short period of time he moves on

1086
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,530
and everybody wonders what had happened

1087
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,110
because there was so much fanfare at the beginning.

1088
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:42,390
Now at the beginning,

1089
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,880
him even opening that dialogue with North Korea

1090
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,770
was masterful.

1091
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,440
Like, I was such a fan.

1092
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,320
When you got a president of the United States

1093
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,780
that is willing to sit down and talk with the leader

1094
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,660
of another nation, when every other president,

1095
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,827
all our advisors are saying,

1096
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,680
"The leader of North Korea is beneath you.

1097
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,680
You cannot dignify him by responding to him directly."

1098
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,040
And consequently the Trump administration

1099
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,680
inherits a can of worms

1100
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,800
that has been simmering for 30 years.

1101
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,907
He didn't get us into that.

1102
00:46:14,907 --> 00:46:16,860
And he opened up a dialogue

1103
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,290
where nobody else was capable of opening a dialogue

1104
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,120
and then it just went away.

1105
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,470
Nobody knows what happened.

1106
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,460
And there was no deal made.

1107
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,010
Now great negotiators make deals.

1108
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,590
- What do you think about these accusations

1109
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:32,853
that he's a narcissist?

1110
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,500
If you're a narcissist, does that help you or hurt you?

1111
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,530
- Is there a more popular term these days than narcissist?

1112
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:41,490
Like everybody's a narcissist.

1113
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:42,753
- Everybody you don't like is a narcissist.

1114
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:44,940
- Like the homeless guy down on the corner,

1115
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,220
he's a narcissist, that's why he is there.

1116
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,230
- Yeah, it's lost meaning for you a little bit?

1117
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:50,760
- Yeah, and first of all,

1118
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,353
most psychological terms,

1119
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,160
as a hostage negotiator, and really

1120
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,610
we were never into psychology

1121
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,270
and we steered away from it,

1122
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:05,270
'cause psychology at best is soft science.

1123
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,530
If it's not informed these days,

1124
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,650
if it's not informed by real studies

1125
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,313
or neuroscience, the guys

1126
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:15,870
that I'm impressed with these days,

1127
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,310
are psychologist neuroscientists,

1128
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:20,283
now I'm interested in that guy or gal.

1129
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,640
But then a psychology convention,

1130
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,264
do you get 'em all together and they all agree?

1131
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:27,097
- No. - No.

1132
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,710
- But also the interesting thing about psychology

1133
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,340
is each individual person is way more complicated

1134
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,800
than the category psychology tries to create.

1135
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,840
And there's something about the human brain.

1136
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,510
The moment you classify somebody as a narcissist,

1137
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:44,510
or depressed or bipolar, or insane in any kind of way,

1138
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,500
for some reason you don't,

1139
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,120
you give yourself a convenient excuse

1140
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,460
not to see them as a complicated human being

1141
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,900
to empathize with 'em.

1142
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,460
I had that when I was talking to,

1143
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,890
I did an interview with Kanye West

1144
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:58,620
and then there's a lot of popular opinions

1145
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:03,420
about him being mentally unwell and so on,

1146
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,840
and I felt that that kind of way of thinking

1147
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,430
is a very convenient way of thinking

1148
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,370
to ignore the fact that he's a human being

1149
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:15,153
that, again, wants to be understood and heard.

1150
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,620
And that's the only way you can have that conversation.

1151
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,480
- Yeah, I agree completely.

1152
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,776
That's right.

1153
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:24,547
(Lex laughing)

1154
00:48:24,547 --> 00:48:25,986
I feel so close to you now.

1155
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,420
(both laughing)

1156
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,075
- It might 'cause I'm not wearing pants.

1157
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:30,870
(Chris laughing)

1158
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,550
All right, so, what were we-

1159
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,530
- You're funnier than I am. That bothers me.

1160
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,810
- All right. (laughing)

1161
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:38,370
I'll say something stupid soon enough.

1162
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:39,420
Don't worry about it.

1163
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,990
But you said, we were talking about terrorists

1164
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,360
and not negotiating with terrorists.

1165
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,500
Is there something- - Nice job

1166
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,630
going all the way back to where that rabbit hole started.

1167
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,160
- Oh, sh, where's rabbit,

1168
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,060
we're "Alice in Wonderland" right now.

1169
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:56,160
Is there something about walking away?

1170
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,810
Of not negotiating?

1171
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,637
Is there power in that?

1172
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:00,750
- All right, so it depends

1173
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,050
upon whether or not you're doing it with integrity

1174
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,763
or a tactic to start with.

1175
00:49:07,508 --> 00:49:08,341
And then also,

1176
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,910
hostage negotiators are successful 93% of the time,

1177
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,160
kind of across the board.

1178
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,750
Which means that there's 7% of the time it's gonna go bad.

1179
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,710
And that was my old boss, Gary Noesner,

1180
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:27,123
I learned so much from Gary.

1181
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,930
But a phrase that he used over and over and over again

1182
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,330
until I finally worked a case that went bad,

1183
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,910
was "This is gonna be the best chance of success."

1184
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:36,837
Best chance of success.

1185
00:49:36,837 --> 00:49:39,270
And then something went bad, and I remember thinking,

1186
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:41,130
like, "Well best chance of success

1187
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:42,777
is no guarantee of success."

1188
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,210
So your question is,

1189
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:47,400
are there negotiations you should walk away from?

1190
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,433
If you got no shot at success, then don't negotiate.

1191
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,400
And you have to accept the fact

1192
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,230
there's some deals you're never gonna make.

1193
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,490
You know, we teach in my company,

1194
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,590
it's not a sin to not get the deal.

1195
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:01,140
It's a sin to take a long time to not get the deal.

1196
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,180
And, you know, Gary, in his infinite wisdom, you know,

1197
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,880
they realized that there was something

1198
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,233
called suicide-by-cop,

1199
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,370
and that it might have,

1200
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:16,410
Gary was very much into clusters of behavior,

1201
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,360
he kept us away from psychological terms

1202
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,910
and there would be clusters of behavior

1203
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:22,950
that would be high-risk indicators.

1204
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,930
And he wrote a block of instruction

1205
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,433
called high-risk indicators.

1206
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,000
Which meant if you start seeing this stuff show up,

1207
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,250
this thing's probably going bad.

1208
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,420
And you're gonna need to,

1209
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,580
you're gonna need to recognize that from the very beginning

1210
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,260
and adjust accordingly.

1211
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:40,470
And it's the same way in business and personal life.

1212
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,470
I'm talking to a head of a marketing company

1213
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,850
I had tremendous respect for,

1214
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:47,850
I admire what this guy and his company does,

1215
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,323
started from scratch.

1216
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,550
He borrowed space in the back of a drugstore

1217
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,673
to start his company.

1218
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,270
And now it's hugely successful.

1219
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:02,440
And he's laying out to me

1220
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,590
that he finally had to confront a potential client

1221
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:08,740
and walk away from him.

1222
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,030
And he said, "How do you think I handled this?"

1223
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,690
And my answer was, "1,000% correct.

1224
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:17,160
And as a matter of fact,

1225
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,163
the behavior that he indicated, he's a type,

1226
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,393
and you should have walked away sooner than you did,

1227
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,060
because this guy was playing it all the time."

1228
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,160
Al-Qaeda, 2004, they're playing us.

1229
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,360
They're not negotiating.

1230
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,733
We called them out on it.

1231
00:51:33,686 --> 00:51:35,340
We don't think you're negotiating.

1232
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,660
You wouldn't say it exactly like that,

1233
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:40,500
but that was absolutely the approach, you know,

1234
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,190
confront people on their behavior in a respectful way.

1235
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:47,100
- And signal that you're willing to walk away.

1236
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,660
- And mean it, 1,000%.

1237
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:51,240
- And mean it. Isn't that terrifying?

1238
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,110
I mean, it's scary,

1239
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,700
'cause you don't want to really walk away,

1240
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,860
or do you have to really want to walk away?

1241
00:51:55,860 --> 00:52:00,000
- Well, yeah, this core values your view of reality.

1242
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,510
If it's an abundant world, it's not scary to walk away.

1243
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:06,300
If it's a finite world with limited opportunities,

1244
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,350
then it's horrifying.

1245
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:13,110
- (sighs) But you have to use that worldview

1246
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,123
to be willing to actually walk away.

1247
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,290
- [Chris] Yeah.

1248
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:21,640
- It could be walking away from a lot of money.

1249
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,210
It could be walking away from something

1250
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,220
that's gonna hurt people,

1251
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,963
'cause if you lose a hostage.

1252
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:32,640
- Yeah, well, but if they're not gonna let the hostage out?

1253
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,740
Suicide-by-cop, they ain't letting him go.

1254
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:41,373
- The 7%. How do most negotiations fail?

1255
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,520
- The bad guys were never there

1256
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,900
to make a deal in the first place.

1257
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,120
If it was suicide-by-cop.

1258
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,893
If they were there to, if they're on a killing journey,

1259
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,383
it's an Israeli phrase.

1260
00:52:57,222 --> 00:52:58,860
If they're on a killing journey

1261
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,950
and the actions that they're currently engaged in

1262
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,800
are part of that killing journey.

1263
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,240
- Killing journey.

1264
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,640
Is there advice you can give about,

1265
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,600
you mentioned Israel Palestine, the Middle East,

1266
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,510
taking on a few conversations on that topic.

1267
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,340
Is there hope for that part of the world?

1268
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:21,420
And from that hope, is there some advice you could lend?

1269
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,463
- Yeah, I think there's hope, there's.

1270
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,880
Then I got friends on both sides,

1271
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,260
and also, when I got my,

1272
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,493
after I left the FBI,

1273
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,100
most people listened to this,

1274
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,240
but probably not gonna remember

1275
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,160
who Rodney Dangerfield was.

1276
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,030
- [Lex] Oh, come on.

1277
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,863
- But he's a comedian.

1278
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:41,160
- Still doesn't get any respect, yeah.

1279
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,900
- [Chris] Yeah, yeah.

1280
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,850
- New Yorker? Is he a New Yorker?

1281
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:45,900
- I think he was a New York guy.

1282
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,910
- [Lex] Or like Jersey, or something, yeah.

1283
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,460
- Yeah, and he did a movie a long time ago,

1284
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,330
called "Back to School."

1285
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:53,250
He went back to school as an old guy, back to school.

1286
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,770
So I went back to school after I left the FBI.

1287
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,133
I did get a masters at Harvard Kennedy.

1288
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,410
And that's where, you know,

1289
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,810
I'm running across people on both sides of that.

1290
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,197
And when they could talk, they said,

1291
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:10,770
"Let's start from the premise that both sides

1292
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,110
want a better life for our kids."

1293
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:16,920
Which is this version that I was telling you earlier

1294
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,370
from Tom Girardi, let's pick a point in the future

1295
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,440
that we're all happy with.

1296
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,080
And they found that they could talk, you know.

1297
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,580
All right, so it might not be better for us.

1298
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,480
How do we make it better for our kids?

1299
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,560
And that's where the hope derives from.

1300
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,990
Because I think both sides ultimately

1301
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,460
want it to be better for their kids,

1302
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:39,360
which is why they still engage in interactions,

1303
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,250
and which is why I think the leadership,

1304
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:46,250
regardless of how compromised they might be on either side,

1305
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:48,690
there're few straight players in the game

1306
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,593
in the Middle East, or anywhere for that matter,

1307
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:56,490
but they want a better future for their kids.

1308
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,323
You get people to agree

1309
00:54:57,323 --> 00:54:58,710
that you want a better future for your kids,

1310
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:59,587
now you can start talking about,

1311
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:02,190
"Well, how do we work our way back from that?"

1312
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,010
And then, all right, so we got a mutual point in the future.

1313
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,150
The Israeli Palestinian negotiations

1314
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,100
are also for me interesting,

1315
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,180
'cause you mentioned Clubhouse.

1316
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,953
About almost two years ago now,

1317
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:18,300
when Israel was shelling Gaza.

1318
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,983
They hit the UPI office.

1319
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:22,230
You know, they were hitting,

1320
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:25,590
they got fed up with the rocket attacks from Hamas.

1321
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,250
And of course Hamas is putting rockets in the UPI office

1322
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,130
or the AP office, whichever press office it was there.

1323
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,080
How's that office gonna be there otherwise?

1324
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,403
Hamas is running the show.

1325
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,640
You're not gonna run that office unless they let you,

1326
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,410
unless you let them store weapons there.

1327
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,860
That's just part of the game.

1328
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,430
And are they gonna,

1329
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,263
are they gonna store 'em

1330
00:55:45,263 --> 00:55:47,460
in specially designated ammunition dumps?

1331
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,080
No, they're gonna put 'em in schools,

1332
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,430
they're gonna put 'em in hospitals,

1333
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,380
they're gonna put 'em in all places

1334
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,010
that when Israel hits 'em, they're gonna look really bad.

1335
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:56,843
So after a while,

1336
00:55:56,843 --> 00:55:58,830
Israel gets fed up, they start shelling Gaza

1337
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,383
and they're hitting these places.

1338
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,480
Friend of mine, Nicole Behnam,

1339
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,267
is hosting rooms on Clubhouse and she says,

1340
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:10,140
"You gotta come on. The vitriol is killing me.

1341
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,150
These are all turning into screaming matches.

1342
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:14,370
Nobody's talking to anybody."

1343
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,420
I said, "All right, cool.

1344
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,160
We'll go on, we'll do it,

1345
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,620
and watch, we won't have a single argument.

1346
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,820
And we'll invite people on from both sides."

1347
00:56:23,010 --> 00:56:25,050
There was one rule.

1348
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,350
Before you started to describe

1349
00:56:28,350 --> 00:56:30,100
what you thought of the other side,

1350
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,960
you had to say, "Before I disagree with you,

1351
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,480
here's what I think your position is."

1352
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,390
And you gotta continue to state the other side's position

1353
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,133
until they agree that you it.

1354
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,630
Now what happened?

1355
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:48,270
No agreement and no arguments.

1356
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:50,550
That was what we were really going for.

1357
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:54,180
We wanted to show that people on both sides

1358
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,760
in one of their emotional timeframes,

1359
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,230
if your only requirement

1360
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,143
was you had to state the other side's position first,

1361
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,710
nobody got outta control.

1362
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,180
- Did it work?

1363
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,010
- That's exactly what happened.

1364
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,340
We wanted to show people that you can have conversations

1365
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:16,260
that do not devolve into screaming matches

1366
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,520
with vitriol, talking about how you're dedicated

1367
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,140
to the destruction of the other side.

1368
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:26,340
Just first see if you can outline where they're coming from.

1369
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:28,860
- That's really impressive because I've just,

1370
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,930
having seen on Clubhouse,

1371
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:34,170
people, which part of the reason I liked Clubhouse,

1372
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,930
'cause you get to hear voices from all sides,

1373
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:40,503
they were emotionally intense.

1374
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:45,240
(laughs) It was, I mean, I was,

1375
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,510
I'm sweating just in the buildup of your story here.

1376
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,360
I thought it's gonna go to hell.

1377
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,830
But you're saying it kind of worked.

1378
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,140
- Not one person lost control.

1379
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,000
Now of the two sides,

1380
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,860
the people that were speaking

1381
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,130
on behalf of the Israelis were a little better

1382
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:07,083
at articulating supportive positions for the Palestinians.

1383
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:09,510
Most of the people that wanna speak up

1384
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,883
on behalf of the Palestinians, they just,

1385
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,150
they'd wanna start in like, "You're doing this."

1386
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:16,140
And I'd say, "No, no, no, no.

1387
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,420
You can go there, just not yet.

1388
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,253
Before you go there,

1389
00:58:19,253 --> 00:58:21,540
you can say that all you want.

1390
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,640
Before you go there,

1391
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,070
you've gotta try to articulate to them

1392
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:26,940
where they're coming from.

1393
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,230
They gotta tell you you got it right."

1394
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:30,750
And what would consistently happen

1395
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:35,160
is there's a leveling out of a person

1396
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,620
to try to see the other side's perspective

1397
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:38,760
and articulate it.

1398
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,890
It's enormously beneficial to the person

1399
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:43,020
who's trying to do it.

1400
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,227
Which was really the point that we were trying to make.

1401
00:58:45,227 --> 00:58:46,200
- It's a really interesting exercise.

1402
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,080
I mean, that by way of advice.

1403
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,540
So if it works at Clubhouse, for people who don't know,

1404
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:54,120
that's a sort of like a voice app

1405
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,610
where you can be anonymous.

1406
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:57,660
So it's really regular people,

1407
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,280
but regular people who can also be anonymous.

1408
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,220
It's just, it could be chaos.

1409
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,200
If it works there, that's really interesting

1410
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,930
for when you sit down for a conversation

1411
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,493
across the table from somebody.

1412
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,360
Don't have them even steal me on the other side,

1413
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:15,663
have them just state the other side.

1414
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,210
Just explained your understanding of it.

1415
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,043
That's it.

1416
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:24,600
- And every now and then I would jump in,

1417
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,380
like, you know, "And is somebody supporting Israel?"

1418
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,780
You know, whoever the heck they were.

1419
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,153
And they'd say a couple things.

1420
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,690
And the Palestinian guy would be like, "Ah,"

1421
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:39,127
or gal, or a supportive of them, would say, you know,

1422
00:59:39,127 --> 00:59:39,960
"You missed some stuff."

1423
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,880
And I'd say, "Let me jump in.

1424
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,830
First of all, I know what the Nakba is.

1425
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,580
The Nakba is a catastrophe.

1426
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,590
That's the day Israel was born.

1427
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,943
You, you know, for the rest of the world

1428
00:59:50,943 --> 00:59:53,430
it's the birth of Israel, for you it's the Nakba."

1429
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:57,040
I said, "You've got members of your family

1430
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,140
that is still walking around carrying keys

1431
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,490
to the front door of the house they abandoned."

1432
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,657
And he'd be like, "Yeah."

1433
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,970
And I'd say, "You feel bad that,

1434
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,440
in point of fact,

1435
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,120
that in World War II the world stood back

1436
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:21,780
and watched while the Nazis

1437
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:23,463
threw the Jews off a building.

1438
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,830
The only problem was they landed on you."

1439
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,603
And they'd be like,

1440
01:00:29,603 --> 01:00:32,997
"Yeah, that's where they're coming from."

1441
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:37,020
So articulating, you know,

1442
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:39,870
deeply what the other side feels

1443
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:43,233
is transformative for both people involved in a process.

1444
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,300
- What's the toughest negotiation you've ever been a part of

1445
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,613
or maybe observed or heard of?

1446
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:52,860
What's a difficult case

1447
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,800
that just stands out to you?

1448
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,393
Or maybe just one of many.

1449
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,890
- Well, the stuff we went through

1450
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:06,090
with Al-Qaeda in and around Iraq,

1451
01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:10,353
Iraq in Saudi, first one was in Saudi, 2004 timeframe.

1452
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:14,800
The hardest part about that was working with family members

1453
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:21,560
and not deceiving them about the possibility of the outcome.

1454
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:23,483
- Yeah, how do you talk to family members?

1455
01:01:23,483 --> 01:01:24,990
Is that part of the negotiation?

1456
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,753
- Yeah, empathy, learning empathy the hard way.

1457
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,260
And then being able to take it up to higher levels.

1458
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:33,810
'Cause at its base level,

1459
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:35,100
a guy that we're working with now

1460
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,830
that's coaching us in the US and is a business partner,

1461
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:38,880
his name is Jonathan Smith,

1462
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,030
he pointed out to us that there's kinda,

1463
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:43,770
there's a Shu Ha Ri concept.

1464
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,330
Are you familiar with Shu Ha Ri?

1465
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:46,773
It's a martial arts concept.

1466
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,610
And Shu is, do it exactly

1467
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:52,140
as the master's telling you to do it.

1468
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,273
Wax on, wax off, "Karate Kid" stuff.

1469
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,500
Ha is, when you've done the repetitions enough times,

1470
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,950
you're getting a feel for it,

1471
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:05,820
and you begin to see the same lessons

1472
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:07,200
coming from other masters.

1473
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,850
You're seeing the same thing show up in other places.

1474
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,450
And at the Ri level, you're still in the discipline,

1475
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:17,910
but you're making up your own rules.

1476
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:19,833
It's almost a flow state.

1477
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,920
And you don't realize that you're making up your own rules.

1478
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,500
And if somebody asks you, "Where'd you learn that?"

1479
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,967
You probably say, "I," you know,

1480
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:33,867
"my sensei taught it to me, my master taught it to me."

1481
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,920
This will come back around the negotiating

1482
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,270
with families pretty quick.

1483
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,570
We did this once because, there's a bunch of people

1484
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:44,790
that we coach, business people,

1485
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,740
that are scared of the amount of money

1486
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,800
that they're losing if we're not coaching 'em regularly.

1487
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,630
One of these guys, Michael,

1488
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,630
we're interviewing him for a social media posting

1489
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,157
about two years ago and Michael says,

1490
01:02:57,157 --> 01:03:00,270
"Yeah, you know, you gotta gather data with your eyes."

1491
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:03,060
And I remember, and I went, "Woo, I like that."

1492
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:07,167
I said, "Where did you hear that before?"

1493
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:09,264
And he goes, "I, you know, I don't know.

1494
01:03:09,264 --> 01:03:10,462
I heard it from you, I think."

1495
01:03:10,462 --> 01:03:11,814
And I'm like, "No, no, no, no.

1496
01:03:11,814 --> 01:03:13,320
(Lex laughing)

1497
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:14,640
I'd have remembered saying that.

1498
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,473
- Yeah.

1499
01:03:15,473 --> 01:03:16,650
- That's the first time I've heard that.

1500
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:18,210
He's in Ri.

1501
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:20,700
So what's this got to do with families?

1502
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,520
Empathy, at its base level and the Shu level,

1503
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,380
I learned it on the suicide hotline,

1504
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,017
is saying like, "You sound angry."

1505
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,923
I'm just calling out the elephant in the room.

1506
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,763
Your emotions. What's driving you?

1507
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,660
I'm throwing a label on your affect

1508
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:43,590
and I'm saying, "You sound," or "It sounds like you are."

1509
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,810
'Cause that's the basic "Karate Kid"

1510
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:49,560
wax on, wax off approach.

1511
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,120
Now there are a lot of hostage negotiators

1512
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,590
that'll tell you empathy doesn't work at home.

1513
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:53,520
Not true.

1514
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,070
They've never gotten outta Shu.

1515
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,180
You're getting ready to talk to your significant other

1516
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:03,680
and you wanna go someplace that you know

1517
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,460
is gonna make her angry.

1518
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,417
You wanna go do something.

1519
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:09,180
- Now that's real negotiation right there.

1520
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,730
- You could say to her, "You sound angry."

1521
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,380
In which case she's gonna blow up,

1522
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,217
'cause her reaction is,

1523
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:17,403
"You made me angry, bozo.

1524
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,330
How can you act like you're an innocent third party?

1525
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,840
Or that you were independent of how I feel bad."

1526
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,580
And you learn a little bit more,

1527
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,940
and you say, the high level is,

1528
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,007
"This is probably gonna make you angry."

1529
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,603
And then, what I did with families,

1530
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,283
I knew how they felt before I walked in the door.

1531
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,660
I knew that they were scared to death.

1532
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,840
You find out that your husband, your father,

1533
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:51,300
your brother has been grabbed by Al-Qaeda,

1534
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,050
who are in the business of chopping people's heads off,

1535
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,490
you're gonna be horrified.

1536
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:59,917
I can't walk into them and go like, "You sound angry."

1537
01:04:59,917 --> 01:05:02,247
"Of course I'm angry, you idiot."

1538
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,950
But knowing what they are,

1539
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:09,037
I used to walk into family's houses and I'd say,

1540
01:05:09,037 --> 01:05:10,767
"I know you're angry."

1541
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,040
Now what do the circumstances dictate

1542
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,390
that they should also feel?

1543
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,930
They're gonna feel abandoned by their government.

1544
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:21,390
They're gonna feel totally alone.

1545
01:05:21,390 --> 01:05:24,640
They're gonna be scared and they're gonna be angry

1546
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,470
because they feel the government abandoned them.

1547
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:30,150
Now they're, in point of fact,

1548
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:32,280
is this an accurate statement?

1549
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:35,400
That their loved one voluntarily went into a war zone

1550
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,710
and voluntarily went someplace

1551
01:05:37,710 --> 01:05:39,573
their government told them not to go.

1552
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,840
Are the facts that the government abandoned them?

1553
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,673
Absolutely not.

1554
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:44,700
As a matter of fact, the government warned 'em,

1555
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,310
tried to get 'em to not go and they went anyway.

1556
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,580
But that doesn't change how they felt in a moment.

1557
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:52,117
And I'd walk into a house and I'd go,

1558
01:05:52,117 --> 01:05:53,910
"I know you're angry.

1559
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,660
I know you feel abandoned and alone

1560
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,047
and I know you're horrified

1561
01:05:58,047 --> 01:06:00,270
and I know you feel the United States government

1562
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:01,287
has abandoned you."

1563
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:04,944
And they would look at me and go like, "Yeah.

1564
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:10,680
What do we do now?"

1565
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,880
Now we're ready to rock.

1566
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,120
- Is there, with Al-Qaeda or in general,

1567
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,430
is there a language barrier too?

1568
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:23,340
It could be just barriers or different communication styles.

1569
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:26,669
I mean, you got like a New Yorker way about it.

1570
01:06:26,669 --> 01:06:28,170
(Chris laughs)

1571
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:31,710
That might make somebody from like, I don't know,

1572
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,723
Laguna Beach uncomfortable.

1573
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,347
(Chris laughs)

1574
01:06:36,347 --> 01:06:38,790
Do you feel that language barrier in communication?

1575
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:43,650
Is that language and communication style in itself

1576
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:46,200
creating a barrier?

1577
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,890
- You got a barrier when you think that your way is the way.

1578
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,180
- [Lex] Sure, that's the biggest barrier.

1579
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,433
- Yeah, like, and that happens all the time.

1580
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:55,867
When people talk about,

1581
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:58,650
"What about cross-cultural negotiations?"

1582
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:02,400
You know, "What hand do I gotta shake hands with,

1583
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,047
so that I can get my way?"

1584
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:07,140
Well, if you strip it all down,

1585
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:10,140
we're all basically the same blank slate when we were born.

1586
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:13,050
We got, everybody's got a limbic system.

1587
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:16,530
Everybody's limbic system works pretty much the same way.

1588
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,690
People are driven by the same sorts of decisions.

1589
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,120
How's this affect my future?

1590
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,710
What am I risk of losing?

1591
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,810
How does this affect my identity?

1592
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:27,120
You're a Al-Qaeda kidnapper,

1593
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,100
you're a New York City businessman,

1594
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,410
you're a tobacco farmer in the south,

1595
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:35,310
all making those same decisions based on those same things.

1596
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:38,070
So as soon as I start to navigate that

1597
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:41,550
and I tailor my approach,

1598
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:43,080
which is what empathy is,

1599
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,130
to what you think and how you see things.

1600
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:50,550
So I can be the biggest goofball ever

1601
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,430
from, if you live in the south, yeah,

1602
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:55,233
maybe I'm a New Yorker,

1603
01:07:55,233 --> 01:07:59,073
or I'm somebody from LA or somebody from Chicago,

1604
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:01,950
but my geography is foreign to you,

1605
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,390
but as soon as I start dialing in

1606
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:07,383
on how you see things, suddenly you're listening.

1607
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,540
- What about the three voices you talk about?

1608
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:15,060
The different voices you can use in that communication?

1609
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,973
- Right. The assertive's voice, direct and honest.

1610
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,290
I'm a natural born assertive.

1611
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,819
- Natural born. I thought we're all a blank slate.

1612
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:24,660
If you're born- - Well, yeah.

1613
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,729
That's it, stop catching me on what I said.

1614
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:29,310
How dare you throw, accuse me of what I've said?

1615
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,560
To quote Bono, "I stand accused of what I've said,

1616
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,790
the things I've said."

1617
01:08:32,790 --> 01:08:33,901
- That's a good line.

1618
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:34,979
(Chris laughs)

1619
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,279
He's got a few good lines.

1620
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:39,000
So assertive voice.

1621
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,109
You're born that way.

1622
01:08:40,109 --> 01:08:42,689
Which one, what are the other ones?

1623
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:43,523
- Analyst.

1624
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:45,899
You're an analyst.

1625
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:47,676
- And I could tell you're assertive.

1626
01:08:47,676 --> 01:08:50,343
(both laughing)

1627
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:53,189
What's an analyst's voice?

1628
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:56,712
- Well, an analyst is close- - Smarter.

1629
01:08:56,712 --> 01:08:59,880
(Chris laughs) More thoughtful. (laughs)

1630
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:02,533
- No, as a matter of fact. (laughs)

1631
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:06,060
Look, you ever do a decision tree?

1632
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:06,893
- Yeah. - See,

1633
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:08,760
you like it too, don't you?

1634
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,157
- So a decision tree is, you know,

1635
01:09:11,157 --> 01:09:13,500
I'm a computer scientist, so the way I have,

1636
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:18,304
I like mathematical, systematic ways of seeing the world.

1637
01:09:18,304 --> 01:09:19,835
- [Chris] (laughs) You're just an analyst.

1638
01:09:19,835 --> 01:09:21,210
- (laughs) Yeah.

1639
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,393
- You think Donald Trump would ever say that?

1640
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:25,511
Unlikely.

1641
01:09:25,511 --> 01:09:27,960
- (laughs) What, is he more the assertive kind?

1642
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,460
- [Chris] He's a natural born assertive, yeah.

1643
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,752
- Yeah. Are all New Yorkers like this?

1644
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:33,817
Is this something in the water or?

1645
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:35,340
- Nah, it's the craziest thing.

1646
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:37,689
I mean, there's an affect that a city can have.

1647
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:43,500
And, you know, New York's Northeast, not just New York,

1648
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,710
but the Northeast is a little more the affect

1649
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,939
of the area, of the culture of the area.

1650
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:51,773
The individuals,

1651
01:09:51,773 --> 01:09:54,750
individuals still boil down into the three types,

1652
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:55,830
across the board.

1653
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:57,720
- [Lex] What's the third one?

1654
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,603
- Accommodator. Smiling, optimistic, hopeful.

1655
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,200
I'm 1,000% convinced that the phrase

1656
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,830
hope is not a strategy

1657
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,230
is designed at people's frustration

1658
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:12,900
over a third of the population being accommodators

1659
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,060
that are hope driven.

1660
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,263
I hope this works out.

1661
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:22,530
And they're very relationship, on the surface,

1662
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:24,210
they're very relationship oriented.

1663
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:26,190
They tend to appear to be very positive.

1664
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:29,550
And they are, but it's really built around hope.

1665
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:32,460
- And the idea is you can adopt these three voices when-

1666
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:33,690
- You can, yeah, you can learn 'em.

1667
01:10:33,690 --> 01:10:34,790
They're all learnable.

1668
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:40,210
Analysts are often mistaken for accommodators

1669
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:45,000
because, as you said before, you know,

1670
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,790
analysts are more introspective, more analytical.

1671
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,460
They're looking at the systems at work.

1672
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:55,410
And, if they like to learn,

1673
01:10:55,410 --> 01:10:59,550
they notice that accommodators make more deals

1674
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:00,600
than they make.

1675
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,610
They also notice that there's a higher failure rate

1676
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:03,443
of the deals.

1677
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:07,140
But since they notice stuff and they think about it,

1678
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:10,230
they catch on faster than assertives do.

1679
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:14,100
That the pleasant nature of an accommodator

1680
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,623
contributes strongly to them making deals.

1681
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:21,900
Like my daughter-in-law, is an analyst.

1682
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,174
You know, another descriptor we have,

1683
01:11:25,174 --> 01:11:26,424
an analyst are assassins.

1684
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,890
You know, an analyst will snip you

1685
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:31,650
from a thousand yards out in the middle of the night

1686
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:33,154
and you never know what hits you.

1687
01:11:33,154 --> 01:11:34,738
And they're really happy with that.

1688
01:11:34,738 --> 01:11:36,420
(Lex laughs)

1689
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:40,710
- But how has assertiveness, the assertive voice

1690
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:42,570
served you in negotiation?

1691
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,403
- Poorly.

1692
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,510
The assertive voice is almost always counterproductive.

1693
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,963
It feels like getting hit in the face with a brick.

1694
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,230
And that's almost always counterproductive.

1695
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:59,130
So for me to be more effective, especially in a negotiation,

1696
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,493
I'll need to slow down and smile.

1697
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,360
- You know, I heard that Teddy Roosevelt

1698
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,250
was a good negotiator and that he was extremely stubborn,

1699
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:14,490
and perhaps the right term for that would be assertive,

1700
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:15,720
but he picked his battles.

1701
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,740
Is there some value

1702
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:21,740
to holding strong through principles?

1703
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:22,950
So, I don't even know if,

1704
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:24,630
that's probably the opposite of empathy,

1705
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:28,020
are there times when you can just stick,

1706
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,080
be extremely stubborn to your principles to win-

1707
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:31,957
- Oh, we do it all the time.

1708
01:12:31,957 --> 01:12:35,280
We just, you know, we're just nice about it.

1709
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,140
- [Lex] Okay, it helps to be nice, you're saying?

1710
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,630
- Well, yes, because I need you to hear me.

1711
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,120
And the assertive tone of voice.

1712
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,010
So when we do our training,

1713
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,983
typically we do an exercise called 60 seconds or she dies.

1714
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,430
And I play the bad guy bank robber.

1715
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:52,983
And I ask you to be the hostage negotiator.

1716
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,400
And your job is to, I'll give you

1717
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,043
the four real-world constraints.

1718
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:02,250
And then you gotta try and negotiate me out of the bank.

1719
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,570
Now we're doing this.

1720
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:07,080
Now the first voice that I always use in that exercise

1721
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:11,970
is the assertive's voice, which is the commanding voice.

1722
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:13,830
It's the voice that all police officers are taught

1723
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,880
to use in the street.

1724
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,840
Issue loud and clear commands.

1725
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,100
You know, it doesn't, to me,

1726
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,593
I don't feel like I'm attacking you.

1727
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:27,483
I just feel like I'm being direct and honest and clear.

1728
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,810
You, on the other hand, feel attacked.

1729
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:34,530
Now we're doing this exercise in Austin couple of years ago.

1730
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:37,173
The first participant has an Apple watch on.

1731
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:39,850
He tells us afterwards

1732
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:45,480
that sitting still, not even answering,

1733
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,250
when he first gets hit in the face

1734
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,283
with the assertive's voice, his heart rate jumped to 170,

1735
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:53,460
which is a typical fight or flight reaction.

1736
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,260
I come at you like I'm fighting you.

1737
01:13:57,270 --> 01:14:00,510
Your fight/flight mechanisms all kick into gear,

1738
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:02,310
which clouds you're thinking.

1739
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,503
You're automatically dumber in the moment.

1740
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:09,030
So if I wanna make a great long term deal with you,

1741
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:14,030
highly profitable, I'm agnostic to you being profitable.

1742
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:16,230
Listen, you be profitable, well, that's fine.

1743
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:17,823
I'm here to make money for me.

1744
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:23,283
Me making you dumber will always hurt me.

1745
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:30,450
Me making you feel attacked will always hurt me.

1746
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:32,760
- So there's never a value in being,

1747
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,243
in you making me afraid?

1748
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,260
- There's never a long term value in it.

1749
01:14:40,761 --> 01:14:42,810
That's another thing that Tahl Raz,

1750
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:45,483
when we were writing a book, braced me on,

1751
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,393
'cause he said,

1752
01:14:47,393 --> 01:14:48,660
"There's scientific data out there

1753
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,570
that's called strategic umbrage."

1754
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:52,770
Well, there's data.

1755
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:54,300
Well, whether or not it's scientific,

1756
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,520
I would call that into question.

1757
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,290
But he said there's studies out there

1758
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:02,073
that show that strategic umbrage works.

1759
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,263
And another thing that I also enjoy,

1760
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,270
you probably get tired of me

1761
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:11,850
saying wonderful things about Andrew.

1762
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:13,170
He talked- - There's never,

1763
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:15,690
there's never enough wonderful things to say

1764
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,700
about the great Andrew Huberman,

1765
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,440
the host of the Huberman Lab podcast

1766
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,910
that everybody should subscribe to.

1767
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:21,870
You should talk to Andrew.

1768
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:23,130
- You're funnier than he is though.

1769
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:23,963
I'll give you that.

1770
01:15:23,963 --> 01:15:26,580
- Hear that Andrew? - He's funny accidentally.

1771
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:28,200
He makes me laugh all the time.

1772
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,280
Not when he is trying to be funny. (laughs)

1773
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,230
- Yeah, he's a really,

1774
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:35,070
he's one of the people in this world that's truly legit.

1775
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:36,900
He's a really strong scientist

1776
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,490
and a really strong communicator

1777
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:39,693
and a good human being.

1778
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,170
Those together don't come often.

1779
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,880
And it's nice to see.

1780
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,200
- [Chris] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1781
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,730
- Yeah, he's a treasure, a national treasure.

1782
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:48,600
Anyway, you were saying.

1783
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,090
- Well, he sort of taught me how to think about data

1784
01:15:51,090 --> 01:15:53,103
and studies and science,

1785
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,000
and also from different books

1786
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,990
that he's turned me onto,

1787
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:59,670
he's really helped me think about this stuff.

1788
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:04,350
So the studies about strategic umbrage were done,

1789
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,850
the ones that I've seen, that show it's effective,

1790
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,980
they were simulated negotiations with college students.

1791
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,623
Now here's the problem with that.

1792
01:16:13,814 --> 01:16:15,660
A simulated negotiation with a college student.

1793
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,980
College students are gonna sit down

1794
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,510
as part of their assignment.

1795
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,820
They're gonna sit down one time,

1796
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:23,370
they're gonna sit down for 45 minutes,

1797
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,203
and they're gonna think

1798
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:25,740
that if they didn't come to a deal at all,

1799
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:27,210
that they failed.

1800
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:30,570
And there's no ongoing implementation,

1801
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:31,530
there's just the deal,

1802
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:34,590
and then they walk away from a pretend situation.

1803
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,470
So they got no actual real skin in the game.

1804
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,110
There's no deal on earth

1805
01:16:40,110 --> 01:16:43,590
do you sit down and come to an agreement in 45 minutes

1806
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:44,700
and never see each other again,

1807
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,620
'cause there's the implementation of the deal.

1808
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:47,973
Even if it's only payment.

1809
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:54,030
So the data is flawed based on the way it was collected.

1810
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:56,400
It's a highly flawed study,

1811
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,430
and all data is flawed as you know, as a scientist.

1812
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:01,050
You just gotta be aware what the flaws are

1813
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:04,200
and decide whether or not that destroys the study.

1814
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:07,440
Or what do you think if you take a look at the data,

1815
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,480
there's no such thing as perfect data.

1816
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:10,980
Look at the data, see what you think of it.

1817
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:14,760
The data that says that strategic umbrage works

1818
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,450
is based on flawed circumstances.

1819
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:20,310
- [Lex] Can you explain strategic umbrage?

1820
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,810
- Getting mad, scaring the other side into a deal.

1821
01:17:23,730 --> 01:17:26,500
Getting mad and using anger strategically

1822
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,820
to bully the other side into an agreement.

1823
01:17:32,430 --> 01:17:34,533
- That's nice to hear, in some sense.

1824
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,447
It's nice to hear that empathy is the right way

1825
01:17:37,447 --> 01:17:39,960
in almost all situations.

1826
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:42,213
It's nice. - Best chance of success.

1827
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:44,730
Not that it works every time,

1828
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,980
just it works more than anything else does.

1829
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,570
- What is the technique of mirroring?

1830
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:49,980
There's a lot of cool stuff in your book.

1831
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,300
Let's just kind of jump around.

1832
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,133
What's mirroring?

1833
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:53,253
- Mirroring is like,

1834
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:56,490
it's one of the most fun skills

1835
01:17:56,490 --> 01:17:58,650
because it's the simplest to execute.

1836
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:01,670
You just repeat one to three-ish words

1837
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:02,640
of what somebody said,

1838
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,440
usually the last one to three words.

1839
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,280
What I found about it

1840
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:12,630
is the people that really like mirroring,

1841
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:14,190
love it because it's so simple

1842
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:17,070
and so effortless and invisible.

1843
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:19,950
They typically, for lack of a better term,

1844
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:22,200
tend to be both high IQ and high EQ.

1845
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,790
Like, I'm not a high IQ guy.

1846
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:25,740
I'm an average dude.

1847
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,390
I like to think that I can learn.

1848
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:32,400
In EQ, emotional intelligence is a skill you can build.

1849
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,413
And I'm always working on building it.

1850
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:38,350
But a lot of really regular average people

1851
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:40,590
will be like, "Mirroring, that's stupid.

1852
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:42,274
I'm not doing that."

1853
01:18:42,274 --> 01:18:44,190
And I don't know why they don't like it.

1854
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:46,713
But when I find somebody that loves to mirror,

1855
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,832
I'll always ask 'em, you know,

1856
01:18:50,832 --> 01:18:53,070
"How'd you score on IQ?"

1857
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:55,890
And typically their IQ is pretty high.

1858
01:18:55,890 --> 01:18:59,130
Now I don't know why that combination attracts people

1859
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:01,683
to mirroring, 'cause there's nine skills.

1860
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:04,770
Eight from hostage negotiation,

1861
01:19:04,770 --> 01:19:07,020
and the ninth really was tone of voice

1862
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,900
and we just defined that as a skill.

1863
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,270
And each one is different and focuses

1864
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:15,273
on different components of the conversation.

1865
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,720
And a lot of people don't like to mirror.

1866
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,800
They find it so awkward.

1867
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,690
Like, I don't particularly,

1868
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,310
I'm not particularly strong in mirroring,

1869
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:24,330
I gotta do it intentionally.

1870
01:19:24,330 --> 01:19:25,620
I'm good at labeling.

1871
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:27,270
- But does it almost always work?

1872
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:28,973
- Oh yeah.

1873
01:19:29,825 --> 01:19:33,240
- Yeah. It feels maybe awkward, but there's,

1874
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:35,850
it's true, there's gotta be ways to signal

1875
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:37,250
that you're truly listening.

1876
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:39,113
- [Chris] That's part of it.

1877
01:19:39,113 --> 01:19:41,580
- I think you can do body language, you can, yeah.

1878
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,020
There's a lot of ways to signal that,

1879
01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:46,563
but mirroring is probably just this trivial little hack.

1880
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,050
- It kinda is.

1881
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,580
- You know what, there's a situation.

1882
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,470
I had a conversation with Stephen Kotkin,

1883
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:54,120
he's this historian

1884
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:58,230
and he would say my name

1885
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,970
a lot throughout the conversation.

1886
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:02,370
He would be like, "Well, you have to understand Lex."

1887
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:03,203
Is that?

1888
01:20:03,203 --> 01:20:06,360
And for some reason that was making me feel really good.

1889
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,397
I was like, "He cares about me."

1890
01:20:08,397 --> 01:20:11,760
And I wonder if that key, if everyone has that key,

1891
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,750
that could be a name.

1892
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:16,710
Just using people's name could be powerful.

1893
01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:20,793
- Using the name is really context driven.

1894
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:24,540
It can be extremely powerful

1895
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:26,490
with someone who's genuine,

1896
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:28,593
and it comes across in their demeanor,

1897
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,610
and it's used in a way that you can tell

1898
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:35,520
is meant to encourage you.

1899
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,173
As opposed to exploit you.

1900
01:20:38,335 --> 01:20:41,370
And the people that are really into exploiting

1901
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:44,370
will also use it to do the same thing.

1902
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,814
- So you have to be,

1903
01:20:45,814 --> 01:20:47,790
(chuckles) you have to avoid using the things

1904
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:51,600
that people that are exploiters manipulators use.

1905
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,910
'Cause it might signal to others

1906
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:56,070
that this person is trying to trick me.

1907
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,170
- Gotta be very conscious of it, yeah.

1908
01:20:58,170 --> 01:21:00,090
- What's labeling, that you mentioned, the thing you like?

1909
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,040
- Well, you know, I said earlier

1910
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,900
that whole progression from you sound angry,

1911
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:05,760
to this is probably gonna make you angry,

1912
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,560
to I know you're angry.

1913
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,360
Labeling is hanging a label on an emotion or an affect

1914
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,343
and then just calling it out.

1915
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,150
- Is that almost always good?

1916
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,830
Could it be a source of frustration

1917
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:20,970
when a person's being angry

1918
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,773
and you kind of put a label on it,

1919
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,113
call out the elephant. (sighs)

1920
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:33,060
Is it possible that that will lead to escalation

1921
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,070
of that feeling versus a resolution?

1922
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:39,420
- Well, what would make it bad?

1923
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:44,280
Like, if I'm pointing out like that blatantly obvious.

1924
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,580
Like if I say, "Look, I need you to get up

1925
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,530
and go down to the bank and make the deposit."

1926
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,033
Let's say I'm talking to my,

1927
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:53,917
somebody who works for my company.

1928
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:56,268
"I need you to get on the phone with this person

1929
01:21:56,268 --> 01:21:58,088
and make the appointment."

1930
01:21:58,088 --> 01:21:59,500
And they go,

1931
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:03,583
"Sounds like you want me to talk to this person."

1932
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,690
Yes. (Lex laughs)

1933
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:07,770
That would be annoying.

1934
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,650
If it's just so absurdly obvious,

1935
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:13,440
that there's no insight in your label at all.

1936
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:18,150
And as soon as you're demonstrating an awareness

1937
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:21,123
or a subtlety or an insight, either to you or to them,

1938
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:24,123
now we're making progress.

1939
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:28,020
So the only time a label

1940
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,850
could ever potentially be counterproductive

1941
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:32,760
is like if you weren't actually listening,

1942
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,760
and the label is, indicates that you're not listening.

1943
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,750
You know, I'm teaching at USC

1944
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:44,790
and I'm teaching labels and, you know,

1945
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:46,560
one of the kids in a class,

1946
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,030
he just wants to take the skills

1947
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:50,733
and make his deals and just hustle 'em,

1948
01:22:51,660 --> 01:22:54,240
and he's just looking for a hustle.

1949
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,640
So he writes up a paper about, you know,

1950
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,680
he goes, there's some malls,

1951
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,750
I think over by Palm Springs or someplace,

1952
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:03,300
some outlet malls, a lot of people go to buy suits.

1953
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:07,240
So he goes in there and he immediately starts the bargaining

1954
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:11,790
that my book teaches, with no empathy.

1955
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:14,730
And he's like, throws a price to the guy

1956
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:16,680
and the guy's like, "No."

1957
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,160
And he throws another price to the guy and guy's like, "No!"

1958
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,747
And then he says to the guy behind the counter,

1959
01:23:22,747 --> 01:23:24,720
"Sounds like we can make a deal."

1960
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:26,880
Like no, it doesn't.

1961
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,160
I just shot down everything that you just said.

1962
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:32,340
If anything, it sounds like we're never gonna make a deal.

1963
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,910
But he tried to use this label for manipulation.

1964
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:38,490
Now the guy didn't get mad on the other side,

1965
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:41,100
but it's like clearly this dude is not listening to me.

1966
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,600
- And at the core of everything,

1967
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:45,150
you have a bunch of like, you know,

1968
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:49,620
almost like hacks, like techniques you can use.

1969
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:51,270
But at the core of it is empathy.

1970
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:52,560
At the- - Core of it is empathy.

1971
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,784
Yeah. - That's the main thing.

1972
01:23:53,784 --> 01:23:56,003
You're gotta be able to just sit there and listen.

1973
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,620
- And perceive.

1974
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,750
Yeah, and look for insights.

1975
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:02,490
- You know what, I like silence.

1976
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:05,370
Or like you're both sitting there chilling with a drink,

1977
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:07,110
looking up at the stars.

1978
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:10,560
There's a moment the silence

1979
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,060
makes you kind of zoom out

1980
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:14,160
and realize you're in this together.

1981
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:15,843
As opposed to playing a game,

1982
01:24:17,121 --> 01:24:19,020
or some kind of like chess game of a negotiation.

1983
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,460
You're in it together. I don't know.

1984
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,410
There's some intimacy to the silence.

1985
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:25,503
And like, I'll ask a question,

1986
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:31,680
and just let the other person sit there in silence

1987
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:33,450
before they answer or vice versa.

1988
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,620
They ask me a question,

1989
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,491
I sit there in silence.

1990
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:39,630
That's a big, feels like a big intimate thing.

1991
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:40,890
- Yes.

1992
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:44,550
And the other two types,

1993
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:48,030
until they've experienced that, are afraid of it.

1994
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:50,103
And what I'm actually gonna do is,

1995
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,880
for whatever reason, I'm really comfortable with silence.

1996
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:56,820
I think because I've experienced its effectiveness.

1997
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:58,020
And also my son Brandon,

1998
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:00,660
like he's the king of dynamic silence.

1999
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:02,130
Like he coaches people.

2000
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:06,000
He says "Go silent, count thousands to yourself.

2001
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,142
Don't stop till you run out of numbers."

2002
01:25:08,142 --> 01:25:10,290
- (laughs) That's a good line.

2003
01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:12,780
He's also good, full of good lines.

2004
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,490
- He is. That he is.

2005
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:19,083
And so there's so much to it.

2006
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,740
But the other two types are natural wiring against it,

2007
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,087
until they've experienced it.

2008
01:25:24,087 --> 01:25:26,430
And you know, your gut instinct,

2009
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,780
intuition's giving you data,

2010
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,370
once you've experienced it.

2011
01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:30,960
But your amygdala is kicking into gear,

2012
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,760
again, sorry, I realize it's more complicated than that,

2013
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:35,850
until you've experienced it.

2014
01:25:35,850 --> 01:25:38,133
So accommodators, hope-based.

2015
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:41,130
How do they signal fury?

2016
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:42,180
The silent treatment.

2017
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,140
So when you go silent,

2018
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,380
they're scared to death you're furious.

2019
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:51,960
'Cause that's how they indicate it.

2020
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,580
The assertive thinks to use the analyst when silent,

2021
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:58,480
'cause you want 'em to talk some more.

2022
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:03,960
When a point of fact you're either,

2023
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,847
you're thinking or,

2024
01:26:05,847 --> 01:26:07,710
and I love your description,

2025
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:09,960
the feeling of intimacy in silence

2026
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,240
and experiencing the moment,

2027
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:16,320
'cause I'm actually gonna factor that into trying to get.

2028
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,650
The accommodators love shared intimacy,

2029
01:26:19,650 --> 01:26:21,627
they would love to experience a moment.

2030
01:26:21,627 --> 01:26:24,450
And I can see that being very compelling,

2031
01:26:24,450 --> 01:26:27,180
than be willing to cross that chasm

2032
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:30,250
and experience silence and see how it works for 'em.

2033
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:32,220
- Yeah, it's nerve wracking.

2034
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,140
Which is why it's intimate.

2035
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:34,973
'Cause you start thinking,

2036
01:26:34,973 --> 01:26:35,806
"What's the other person thinking?

2037
01:26:35,806 --> 01:26:36,639
Are we actually gonna do this?

2038
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:39,120
Are we gonna sit here for 10 seconds and count?

2039
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:40,650
I mean, there's tricks to it, I guess,

2040
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:43,470
like Brandon says, is to just count it out

2041
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:47,130
and realize through data that there's intimacy to it.

2042
01:26:47,130 --> 01:26:49,833
I had a friend of mine,

2043
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:55,020
he lost his voice 'cause singing.

2044
01:26:55,020 --> 01:26:57,210
So he couldn't, the doctor said he can't talk

2045
01:26:57,210 --> 01:27:00,333
for a week just to heal the voice.

2046
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:02,130
The vocal chords.

2047
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,730
But he hung out with other people,

2048
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,190
with friends, and didn't talk to them.

2049
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:11,193
He just hung out and he said it was really intimate.

2050
01:27:12,516 --> 01:27:14,670
They both didn't talk to each other.

2051
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,893
They just sat there and enjoyed time together.

2052
01:27:17,893 --> 01:27:20,130
I don't know. It's a wake up call.

2053
01:27:20,130 --> 01:27:22,950
It's a thing to try maybe with people in your life,

2054
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:24,660
just hang out and don't say anything.

2055
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:26,370
Like as an experiment,

2056
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:29,790
don't say anything the entire day, but spend.

2057
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:31,410
- [Chris] Or try. Yeah, definitely.

2058
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,243
- It's interesting.

2059
01:27:32,243 --> 01:27:34,980
I haven't tried it myself. (laughs)

2060
01:27:34,980 --> 01:27:38,820
It seems, it's kinda like a silent retreat,

2061
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:43,820
but more active as part of like regular everyday life.

2062
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:46,260
Anyway. (laughs)

2063
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,360
Is there other interesting techniques

2064
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,320
we can talk about here?

2065
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,510
So for example,

2066
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:53,790
creating the illusion of control.

2067
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,740
- Yeah, that's principally, you know,

2068
01:27:55,740 --> 01:27:57,603
by asking what and how questions.

2069
01:27:58,590 --> 01:28:00,360
'Cause people love to tell others

2070
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,710
what to do or how to do it.

2071
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:04,263
It does a lot.

2072
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:08,000
That was really the way, when the book was first written,

2073
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,310
that we really thought about what and how questions,

2074
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:13,760
is giving the other side the illusion of control.

2075
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:17,160
And there's a lot more to it than that,

2076
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,210
that we've discovered.

2077
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,530
I mean it triggers deep thinking.

2078
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:21,390
It wears people down.

2079
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:23,220
Deep thinking can be exhausting.

2080
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:25,710
- And you want, so what's the role

2081
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:27,240
of exhaustion in negotiation?

2082
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,188
Is that ultimately-

2083
01:28:28,188 --> 01:28:29,790
- You gotta be careful with that.

2084
01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:32,643
Some people exhaust intentionally.

2085
01:28:34,530 --> 01:28:36,630
One of my negotiation heroes,

2086
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:40,140
a guy now who's unfortunately suffering

2087
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:43,170
from dementia and Alzheimer's,

2088
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:46,050
Giandomenico Picco is the UN hostage negotiator

2089
01:28:46,050 --> 01:28:50,037
that got all the western hostages out of Beirut in the '80s.

2090
01:28:50,037 --> 01:28:52,890
And he wrote a book called "Man Without a Gun."

2091
01:28:52,890 --> 01:28:56,400
And I'm acquainted with Gianni, at this point in time,

2092
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,950
I don't think he has any memory of who I am at all.

2093
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:02,283
But he writes in his book,

2094
01:29:04,350 --> 01:29:06,150
one of the great secrets of negotiation

2095
01:29:06,150 --> 01:29:07,983
is exhausting the other side.

2096
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:10,830
Political negotiations, that could be Gianni,

2097
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:11,943
was very deferential.

2098
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,637
He was in the middle of,

2099
01:29:14,637 --> 01:29:17,973
in the '80s leading up to about 1986-ish,

2100
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,340
every negotiation involving

2101
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:27,420
waring parties in the Middle East that you can imagine.

2102
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:29,490
He was in Cyprus.

2103
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:32,943
He was in Afghanistan,

2104
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:35,100
Iraq and Iran.

2105
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:39,750
The Iranian government had tremendous trust in him

2106
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,960
as a westerner, a representative of the UN.

2107
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,950
Got all the westerners out of Beirut

2108
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:48,903
and he was just ridiculously patient.

2109
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,230
And then, which the other side found,

2110
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:53,630
would often find exhausting.

2111
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,960
- So exhaustion can't be a component

2112
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,953
of finding resolution in a negotiation.

2113
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:04,800
- If it tamps down the negative emotions,

2114
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,943
often exhaustion will tamp down negative emotions.

2115
01:30:07,943 --> 01:30:08,847
And if it puts you,

2116
01:30:08,847 --> 01:30:10,410
and getting, the real trick

2117
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:13,320
is really getting negative emotions out of the way.

2118
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,470
'Cause you're dumber in a negative frame of mind.

2119
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:19,020
- So the goal is always positive emotion as you talk about.

2120
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:20,850
That's what you're always chasing together.

2121
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,590
- [Chris] I think so. Yeah.

2122
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,720
- And that's what the that's right is about.

2123
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:26,340
- [Chris] Yes.

2124
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,290
- Like whatever you're triggering,

2125
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,987
whatever the chemistry you're triggering in your brain,

2126
01:30:29,987 --> 01:30:32,610
you're like, "Yeah, yeah, we're doing good here."

2127
01:30:32,610 --> 01:30:36,090
- Yeah, I think so, long term for long term success.

2128
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:36,923
Absolutely.

2129
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:40,710
- How's the word fair used and abused?

2130
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:41,640
- [Chris] The F-bomb.

2131
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:43,860
- The F bomb as you call it.

2132
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,110
How is it used in abused in negotiation?

2133
01:30:46,110 --> 01:30:48,390
- It's usually used,

2134
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:51,300
it's most frequently used as a weapon.

2135
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,273
It's abused as a point of manipulation.

2136
01:30:55,357 --> 01:30:57,930
It's what people say when they feel backed into a corner

2137
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:01,860
and they can't come up with any legitimate reason

2138
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:04,680
as to why they're being backed into a corner.

2139
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,020
Like nobody uses the word F, the F-bomb,

2140
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,220
nobody uses the word fair

2141
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,270
when they've got criteria to back 'em up.

2142
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:14,160
So consequently, when somebody starts dropping it,

2143
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,360
you gotta realize the other side's

2144
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,210
got no legitimate outside criteria.

2145
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:20,340
They're feeling very vulnerable.

2146
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:23,490
They can't explain it, but they feel defensive.

2147
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,740
And saying, "Hey look, I've just,

2148
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,990
I've given you a fair offer,"

2149
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:30,090
is a way for me to knock you off your game

2150
01:31:31,134 --> 01:31:33,240
if you're not not aware of it.

2151
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:36,300
So a lot of cutthroat negotiations,

2152
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:38,940
negotiators are gonna use it on you

2153
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,290
to knock you off your game.

2154
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:44,220
The NFL strike,

2155
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:47,283
probably now, it's been a good 10 years ago,

2156
01:31:51,523 --> 01:31:53,790
and maybe even longer than that.

2157
01:31:53,790 --> 01:31:56,130
One of the sticking points was

2158
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:58,110
the owners were not opening their books to the players.

2159
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:59,810
Players wanted to see the numbers.

2160
01:32:01,470 --> 01:32:05,280
And in order to not open their books,

2161
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,590
they just sent a rep to tell the press conference

2162
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:09,940
saying, "We've given the players a fair offer."

2163
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:14,111
Well, if it was fair, you'd open your books.

2164
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:16,500
- (laughing) Yeah.

2165
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:19,980
- If you gave 'em a fair offer and it was justified

2166
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:21,330
by what was in your books,

2167
01:32:21,330 --> 01:32:23,433
you'd open 'em to prove your point.

2168
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,630
So what ends up happening though, that, well,

2169
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:29,280
the owners gave the players a fair offer

2170
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,080
starts to get picked up in the media

2171
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:33,300
and then it starts getting repeated.

2172
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,880
And now the different people on a player's side

2173
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:36,713
are going like,

2174
01:32:36,713 --> 01:32:38,640
"Yeah, maybe they have given us a fair offer."

2175
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,510
It caused people to be insecure about their own positions.

2176
01:32:42,510 --> 01:32:44,940
It's an enormously powerful word

2177
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,170
that can be used and abused.

2178
01:32:46,170 --> 01:32:48,630
And it almost always comes up in every negotiation.

2179
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:51,330
It's shocking the number of times it comes up

2180
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:53,700
with people who don't really understand

2181
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,560
how or why it's coming up.

2182
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,890
- So usually it's a signal

2183
01:32:58,408 --> 01:33:00,600
of not a good place in negotiations.

2184
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,930
- Without question, I'm completely convinced

2185
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:07,860
that if the person is using the word as a means

2186
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:09,160
of getting what they want,

2187
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,800
then either accidentally or on purpose,

2188
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:15,300
either in their gut or they know

2189
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,410
they got a bad a position,

2190
01:33:16,410 --> 01:33:18,260
or their gut is afraid that they are.

2191
01:33:19,830 --> 01:33:21,720
Do I use the word?

2192
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:23,730
What I'll say is, "I want you to feel

2193
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:25,800
like I've treated you fairly,

2194
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,990
and if at any given point in time

2195
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:29,490
you think I'm not treating you fairly,

2196
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:33,027
I want you to stop me and we're gonna address it."

2197
01:33:34,590 --> 01:33:35,760
- Big ridiculous question.

2198
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:40,140
But how do you close the deal?

2199
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:45,140
How do you take the negotiation to its end?

2200
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:48,150
Is implementation ultimately-

2201
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:50,520
- You gotta pivot to agreed upon implementation,

2202
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:52,833
to really move out on the negotiation.

2203
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:56,037
And I may say, "How do you wanna proceed?"

2204
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,857
And if you don't know, I might say,

2205
01:33:59,857 --> 01:34:02,490
"No one to question, is it a ridiculous idea

2206
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,990
if I share with you some ideas of how to proceed?"

2207
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,370
- And then you agree on the actual steps,

2208
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:09,810
and that's the implementation,

2209
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:12,240
it's not just a philosophical agreement,

2210
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,800
it's actual steps.

2211
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:16,140
- The big problem in all negotiations

2212
01:34:16,140 --> 01:34:18,813
is a lack of discussion of next steps.

2213
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:23,100
- That is deep.

2214
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:25,710
Who is the best negotiator you've ever met?

2215
01:34:25,710 --> 01:34:28,170
- Yeah, actually probably my son, Brandon.

2216
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,003
- Yeah? - Yeah.

2217
01:34:29,003 --> 01:34:31,050
He's ridiculously talented.

2218
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:32,913
I mean, he's ridiculously talented.

2219
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:36,000
And he, yeah, he's, you know,

2220
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,917
and what was it, Coyle's book,

2221
01:34:38,917 --> 01:34:41,250
"The Talent Code," says that, you know,

2222
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:43,620
people just noticed it and started getting good at it.

2223
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,720
There's no such thing as a child prodigy.

2224
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,400
They just got interested when they were a kid.

2225
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,280
I mean, Brandon started learning how to negotiate

2226
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,580
when he was two years old,

2227
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,320
and he's been in it and immersed in it, you know,

2228
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,730
since he could make complete sentences.

2229
01:34:56,730 --> 01:34:58,800
Even before he could make complete sentences.

2230
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,630
He's ridiculously talented.

2231
01:35:00,630 --> 01:35:02,070
- What's his future?

2232
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,243
What's he want to do?

2233
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:06,750
- He has been involved.

2234
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:08,820
He run and built my company

2235
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:12,180
and now he's gonna be an affiliated licensee,

2236
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,710
run his own operation.

2237
01:35:13,710 --> 01:35:16,053
He's pretty much gonna end up doing very much.

2238
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:20,820
It's gonna open his entrepreneurial opportunities

2239
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:22,380
to do whatever he wants

2240
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:25,380
and not have his dad say no. (laughs)

2241
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:26,880
- [Lex] And do a better job than his dad.

2242
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,320
- Most likely.

2243
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:30,450
- Yeah. (laughs)

2244
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:31,283
Okay.

2245
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:33,960
Do you see some of the techniques

2246
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,273
that you talk about as manipulative?

2247
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,120
- Manipulation is whether or not

2248
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,020
I'm trying to exploit you or hurt you.

2249
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,660
Am I trying to manipulate a bank robber

2250
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:47,163
into letting me save his life?

2251
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:48,923
Yeah.

2252
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:52,050
So manipulation is like,

2253
01:35:52,050 --> 01:35:53,793
what am I trying to do to you?

2254
01:35:56,287 --> 01:35:58,020
- But so you don't see the negative connotation?

2255
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:01,710
If you're trying to bring a better future,

2256
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:03,690
it's not manipulation?

2257
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:05,700
- It's not if I'm trying to bring a better future,

2258
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:07,950
if I'm being genuine and honest,

2259
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:10,860
like I compliment you.

2260
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:15,860
If my compliment is genuine, that's not manipulation.

2261
01:36:16,290 --> 01:36:18,783
Like, and, but, you know, if I think,

2262
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:24,300
you know, you got a pair of shoes

2263
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,750
that are the dumbest looking things I've ever seen,

2264
01:36:27,750 --> 01:36:29,340
and I go, "Wow, those are great shoes."

2265
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:30,540
Now that's manipulation.

2266
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:33,990
- So there's guys like Warren Buffett

2267
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:36,600
who are big on integrity and honesty.

2268
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,870
What's the role of lying effective?

2269
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:43,350
- I think it's a bad idea.

2270
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:46,593
Lying is just a bad idea for a variety of reasons.

2271
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:48,663
First of all,

2272
01:36:51,498 --> 01:36:52,710
there's a really good chance the other side

2273
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:53,820
is a better liar than you are.

2274
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:55,763
They're gonna spot it right off the bat.

2275
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:59,850
Secondly, they could be luring you into a trap

2276
01:36:59,850 --> 01:37:01,000
to see if you will lie.

2277
01:37:02,640 --> 01:37:04,470
Thirdly, the chances are they're gonna find out

2278
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:08,790
that you lied to 'em eventually is really high.

2279
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:13,110
And then the penalties and the taxes are gonna be way higher

2280
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:15,360
than what you had in the first place.

2281
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,730
- So long term, you wanna have a reputation of somebody

2282
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:19,620
with integrity and the more you lie,

2283
01:37:19,620 --> 01:37:21,570
the harder it is to maintain that reputation.

2284
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:23,670
- Yeah, exactly. And words' gonna get out.

2285
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,617
- Yeah, so what's the,

2286
01:37:26,617 --> 01:37:29,160
if we can just return to that question.

2287
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,580
What's the difference between a good conversation

2288
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,530
and a good negotiation?

2289
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:39,450
Can we, because I think just reading your work,

2290
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:42,450
listening to you, there's a sense I have

2291
01:37:42,450 --> 01:37:45,090
that the thing we're doing now,

2292
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:47,790
in this conversation on the podcast and so on,

2293
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:49,680
is different than negotiation.

2294
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,580
It feels like the purpose is different

2295
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:55,330
and yet having some of the same awareness

2296
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:59,880
of the value of empathy is extremely important.

2297
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:04,173
But it feels like the goals are different. Or no?

2298
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:06,450
- Really close, fine line.

2299
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:08,970
I mean, I, you know, I rolled in here

2300
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:11,190
not having any expectations,

2301
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:12,450
not looking for anything other

2302
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:14,910
than having an interesting conversation.

2303
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:19,710
And to hear what was behind the questions

2304
01:38:19,710 --> 01:38:23,100
that you were asking me and what interests you.

2305
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:26,250
And then also your description of silence

2306
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,150
and the power of silence.

2307
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:29,400
Something I'm gonna take away as a learning point

2308
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:32,220
and help learn to teach others.

2309
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:33,810
But I didn't come in here.

2310
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:36,660
I suppose a negotiation is when we're both aware

2311
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:39,060
of a problem we're trying to solve.

2312
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:41,594
- Right, there's no problem in the room

2313
01:38:41,594 --> 01:38:43,050
for us to solve.

2314
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:46,590
Except maybe like the human condition and. (chuckles)

2315
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:47,730
- [Chris] Insight, you know. Wisdom.

2316
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:49,113
- Insight. - Learn.

2317
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:56,073
- How do you train to become better at negotiating?

2318
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,930
In business, in life.

2319
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:03,810
- Yeah, just small stakes practice for high stakes results.

2320
01:39:03,810 --> 01:39:07,003
I mean, decide what kinda negotiating resonates with you.

2321
01:39:07,003 --> 01:39:08,310
I mean- - What's that mean?

2322
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:11,250
Small stakes practice for high stakes or small stakes?

2323
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:14,760
So small, little incremental,

2324
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:16,020
like picking up girls at a bar,

2325
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:16,853
or what are we talking about?

2326
01:39:16,853 --> 01:39:18,720
- Well, it can be for some people

2327
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,433
that's high stakes practice.

2328
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,300
Well, you know, labeling mirrors,

2329
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:26,640
what are the basic tools of great negotiation?

2330
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:29,040
Labeling, mirror, and paraphrasing, summarizing.

2331
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,810
So you start labeling and mirroring people

2332
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:36,630
that you just having regular interactions with,

2333
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,910
just to gain a feel for

2334
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:40,650
whether or not you can read somebody's affect,

2335
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,210
or how accurate your read is

2336
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:43,210
to get better at it.

2337
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:46,110
And so, you know,

2338
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:49,413
label the Lyft driver,

2339
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:52,473
or the grocery store clerk,

2340
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:58,320
or person behind the airline counter at the airport.

2341
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,000
- So putting a label on their affect.

2342
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,820
- Or throwing something at 'em that,

2343
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:05,250
'cause negotiation is a perishable skill.

2344
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,100
Emotional intelligence is perishable.

2345
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:09,870
So seeing if you can indicate

2346
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,970
that you understand their label.

2347
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:14,490
One of my favorite labels to throw out on somebody,

2348
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:17,490
which, you know, maybe Ri level,

2349
01:40:17,490 --> 01:40:19,380
I might look at somebody who looks distressed

2350
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:20,630
and I'll go, "Tough day?"

2351
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:24,930
So several years ago,

2352
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:27,540
I'm at the counter at LAX.

2353
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:30,330
Well, I'm waiting in the line to get to the counter

2354
01:40:30,330 --> 01:40:32,130
and a lady behind the counter

2355
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:33,990
is clearly making it a point

2356
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:38,220
to not meet my eyes so that I don't approach.

2357
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,860
And she looks, and so like you, you know,

2358
01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:43,020
you know when you're next in line

2359
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:45,903
and they're making sure that you don't meet eyes.

2360
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:48,570
And I'm thinking to myself, "All right,

2361
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:49,650
so they're having a bad day."

2362
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:52,320
So I walk up and as soon as I approach the counter,

2363
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,910
I go, "Tough day?"

2364
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:56,940
And she kinda snaps around

2365
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:59,400
and she goes, "No, no, no. How can I help you?"

2366
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:01,150
And goes out of her way to help me.

2367
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:04,890
Now I'm practicing, but I also know I made her feel better.

2368
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:05,970
It relieved some of the stress.

2369
01:41:05,970 --> 01:41:07,350
So now I'm going through TSA,

2370
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:09,325
wanna look for people who are having a tough day.

2371
01:41:09,325 --> 01:41:10,457
- [Lex] (laughs) It's a good place to find them.

2372
01:41:10,457 --> 01:41:13,290
- It's a good place to find and practice.

2373
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:14,880
And I'm rolling through the line

2374
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,920
and I realize I haven't tossed a label out

2375
01:41:16,920 --> 01:41:18,060
on any one of these guys.

2376
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:20,430
And there's this guy watching the bags

2377
01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:22,170
come out of the x-ray machine

2378
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:25,020
and he's just kind of got an indifferent look on his face.

2379
01:41:25,020 --> 01:41:26,217
And I go, "Tough day?"

2380
01:41:27,090 --> 01:41:27,960
And he kind of goes,

2381
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,423
I could see from his body language like, no.

2382
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,510
And I go, "Just another day, huh?"

2383
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:35,880
And he goes, "Yeah, just another day."

2384
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,430
You know, he felt seen but I missed

2385
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:41,100
and I'm practicing and I'm trying to stay sharp.

2386
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:42,510
So these are. - Just a few words.

2387
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:43,500
With just a few words,

2388
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:47,269
you're trying to like quickly localize their affect.

2389
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:49,110
- Nice. - And deliver on it.

2390
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:50,910
- Very analytically said, thank you.

2391
01:41:52,287 --> 01:41:53,637
(both chuckling)

2392
01:41:53,637 --> 01:41:55,350
I'm not letting it go.

2393
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:56,348
- I love it.

2394
01:41:56,348 --> 01:41:59,640
(both laughing)

2395
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:02,670
Does the same apply to just conversation in general?

2396
01:42:02,670 --> 01:42:04,110
Just how to get better at conversation.

2397
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:05,760
I think a lot of people struggle.

2398
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:06,660
They have insecurities,

2399
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:08,040
they have anxiety about conversation.

2400
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:10,350
I, as funny as this is to say,

2401
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:13,350
have a lot of anxiety about conversation.

2402
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:16,590
Is that, basically do the same kind of practice?

2403
01:42:16,590 --> 01:42:17,560
Practice some of the techniques in your book?

2404
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:19,380
- Yeah, genuinely, just trying to make sure

2405
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:20,530
you heard somebody out.

2406
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:23,850
- What's the best conversation you've ever been in?

2407
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:25,089
Except this one, of course.

2408
01:42:25,089 --> 01:42:27,660
(Chris laughs)

2409
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:28,830
- [Chris] Wow.

2410
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:31,200
- What, I mean, not the best conversation,

2411
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,360
but what stands out to you

2412
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,510
as a conversation that changed you as a person, maybe?

2413
01:42:36,510 --> 01:42:39,030
- Well, there's probably been a lot of them along the way.

2414
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:43,710
I mean, but one that I remember on a regular basis.

2415
01:42:43,710 --> 01:42:44,970
Actually, there's two.

2416
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:47,310
But when I was in the bureau,

2417
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:49,920
I'm at Quantico, I'm there for an end services,

2418
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:53,700
another guy from New York, buddy of mine named Lionel.

2419
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,260
And we're both trying to decide

2420
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:56,580
whether or not we wanna be,

2421
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:59,400
try to get into profiling or negotiation

2422
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:00,960
'cause they're both about human dynamics

2423
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:03,780
and both of us really like human dynamics.

2424
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:05,400
And we're sitting around talking about it

2425
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,140
and we're talking about several things.

2426
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:08,337
And he labels me.

2427
01:43:08,337 --> 01:43:09,870
And I knew he didn't know what he was doing,

2428
01:43:09,870 --> 01:43:11,460
I think he was just,

2429
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:12,480
he had picked it up,

2430
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:16,383
and I'd been talking about my family, quite a few things.

2431
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:19,710
And he said to me,

2432
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:22,383
and I never said this directly that we were close,

2433
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:24,210
but he said to me,

2434
01:43:24,210 --> 01:43:26,160
"It sounds like your family's really close."

2435
01:43:26,160 --> 01:43:29,370
And I can remember in the moment like this feeling,

2436
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:32,160
just, like I felt great in the moment.

2437
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:35,250
I mean, what he said just drew together everything

2438
01:43:35,250 --> 01:43:37,587
that I'd been saying and nailed the essence of it.

2439
01:43:37,587 --> 01:43:40,530
And I have a very clear recollection

2440
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:42,543
of how good that felt in the moment.

2441
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:46,320
So a couple years later, I'm on a suicide hotline.

2442
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,420
Now, I got this line in the back of my head,

2443
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:51,630
you know, line, technique, reaction,

2444
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:53,970
read, whatever you wanna call it.

2445
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:55,980
Guy calls in on the hotline

2446
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:58,350
and I could tell the dude is rattled by his tone of voice.

2447
01:43:58,350 --> 01:44:00,153
I mean, just amped up.

2448
01:44:00,990 --> 01:44:02,463
And he goes, you know,

2449
01:44:02,463 --> 01:44:04,260
"I'm just trying to put a lid on the day,

2450
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:05,730
I need your help putting a lid on the day.

2451
01:44:05,730 --> 01:44:07,740
I gotta put a lid on the day."

2452
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:12,297
And I go, "You sound anxious."

2453
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:16,170
And he goes, "Yeah."

2454
01:44:16,170 --> 01:44:17,790
And he came down a little bit

2455
01:44:17,790 --> 01:44:20,880
and he was a guy that was, he was telling me about,

2456
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:24,570
he was battling a disease of paranoia

2457
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:25,830
and he is gonna go on a car trip

2458
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:27,630
with his family the next day.

2459
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:30,540
And he knew that on the car trip he was gonna, you know,

2460
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:31,950
twist himself into knots.

2461
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:32,783
And so the night before,

2462
01:44:32,783 --> 01:44:34,323
he is twisting himself into knots.

2463
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:37,410
And he's laying out everything

2464
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:41,790
that he is done to try to beat paranoia

2465
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:43,690
and how much his family's helping him.

2466
01:44:45,662 --> 01:44:47,160
And he's going on the car trip with the family

2467
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:49,890
'cause they're gonna take him to see a doctor.

2468
01:44:49,890 --> 01:44:51,750
And so I hit him with the same thing

2469
01:44:51,750 --> 01:44:53,220
that my buddy Lionel said.

2470
01:44:53,220 --> 01:44:55,830
I said, "It sounds like your family's close."

2471
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:57,300
And he goes, "Yeah, we are close."

2472
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,550
And he leveled out a little bit more.

2473
01:44:59,550 --> 01:45:02,310
And then he started ticking off all the things

2474
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:04,140
that he was doing to try to beat paranoia.

2475
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:05,583
And he sounded determined.

2476
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,990
And so I said, "You sound determined."

2477
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:12,580
And he goes, "Yeah, I am determined

2478
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:15,160
and I'll be fine tomorrow.

2479
01:45:16,110 --> 01:45:16,943
Thanks."

2480
01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:20,010
And that was all I said.

2481
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:21,390
So those two conversations,

2482
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:23,220
which are overlapping conversations,

2483
01:45:23,220 --> 01:45:25,650
those two things really stick out in my mind.

2484
01:45:25,650 --> 01:45:26,483
- Do those things,

2485
01:45:26,483 --> 01:45:28,200
like through all the different negotiations

2486
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:29,650
and conversations you've had,

2487
01:45:31,606 --> 01:45:34,470
do they kinda echo throughout?

2488
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:35,733
Like you basically,

2489
01:45:38,220 --> 01:45:40,710
because when you empathize with other human beings,

2490
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:42,873
you start to realize we're all the same.

2491
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:48,090
And so you can start to pick

2492
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:50,313
little phrases here and there

2493
01:45:50,313 --> 01:45:51,720
that you've heard from others,

2494
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,760
little experiences that we're all about,

2495
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,113
like, we all want to be,

2496
01:45:58,500 --> 01:45:59,840
to be close with other human beings.

2497
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:02,040
We all want love.

2498
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:02,873
That we're all,

2499
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:06,900
I think we're all deeply lonely inside (laughs)

2500
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,133
looking for connection.

2501
01:46:09,810 --> 01:46:12,660
We're just, if we're honest about it.

2502
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:15,690
And so all humans have that same,

2503
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:17,280
all the same different components

2504
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:20,943
of what makes them tick.

2505
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:24,180
So you kind of see yourself basically

2506
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:27,150
just saying the same things

2507
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:28,710
to connect with another human being?

2508
01:46:28,710 --> 01:46:31,140
- Yeah, there aren't that many different things

2509
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:33,030
that we're looking for, or understanding on,

2510
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:35,250
or connection on or satisfaction of.

2511
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:38,460
There just aren't that many of them, regardless.

2512
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,563
And so yeah, you're looking for,

2513
01:46:41,550 --> 01:46:45,570
to manifest itself in some form or another

2514
01:46:45,570 --> 01:46:46,830
and you're willing to take a guess

2515
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:49,230
on whether or not that's what you're seeing or hearing.

2516
01:46:49,230 --> 01:46:51,750
- What advice would you give to me

2517
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:56,073
to be better at these conversations?

2518
01:46:57,420 --> 01:46:58,620
To me and to other people

2519
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:02,193
that do kinda interviews and podcasts and so on.

2520
01:47:03,146 --> 01:47:04,930
- [Chris] Wow.

2521
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:07,650
- 'Cause I really care about empathy as well.

2522
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:09,368
Is there a kind of,

2523
01:47:09,368 --> 01:47:11,160
there's a lifelong journey in this process?

2524
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:12,060
- Yeah, well, I think,

2525
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,010
I would advise you to take that approach,

2526
01:47:14,010 --> 01:47:15,390
which is the approach that you're taking.

2527
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:18,420
You care about it, you're very curious about it.

2528
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:19,950
You see it as a lifelong journey.

2529
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:21,423
You're fascinated by it.

2530
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:26,313
You enjoy learning about it.

2531
01:47:27,450 --> 01:47:30,000
And you definitely do see it as a lifelong journey

2532
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,070
as opposed to this is what I can,

2533
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:34,260
if I can acquire this, then I can manipulate people.

2534
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:37,050
- No, I mean, I fall in love with people I talk to.

2535
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:40,170
There's a kinda deep connection and it lingers with you,

2536
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:41,703
especially when I'm preparing.

2537
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,030
The more material there's on a person,

2538
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:47,490
the more you get to fall in love with 'em ahead of time

2539
01:47:47,490 --> 01:47:50,670
that you get to really understand, not understand,

2540
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:55,050
but what I mean by fall in love is.

2541
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:56,340
- [Chris] Well, appreciate, huh?

2542
01:47:56,340 --> 01:47:58,950
- Appreciate but also become deeply curious.

2543
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:00,060
That's what I mean by fall in love.

2544
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,130
Like, you appreciate the things you know,

2545
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:04,410
but you start to see, like "Alice in Wonderland,"

2546
01:48:04,410 --> 01:48:07,260
you start to see that there's all this cool stuff

2547
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:09,750
you can learn if you keep interacting with them.

2548
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:12,180
And then when you show up and you actually meet,

2549
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:15,480
you realize it's like more and more and more and more.

2550
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:17,160
It's like in physics, the more you learn,

2551
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,390
the more you realize you don't know.

2552
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:20,220
And it's like, it's really exciting.

2553
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:21,780
And then it could also be heartbreaking,

2554
01:48:21,780 --> 01:48:23,490
'cause you have to say goodbye.

2555
01:48:23,490 --> 01:48:25,890
The goodbye, I hate goodbyes.

2556
01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:26,723
I hate goodbyes.

2557
01:48:26,723 --> 01:48:28,080
- Seems total, right?

2558
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:32,013
- Yeah. It reminds me that I'm gonna die one day.

2559
01:48:32,013 --> 01:48:34,350
(laughs) Like things end,

2560
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:36,180
good things end, it sucks.

2561
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:39,540
But then it makes the moment more delicious, you know,

2562
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:41,343
that you do get to spend together.

2563
01:48:42,611 --> 01:48:44,463
(laughs) Okay.

2564
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:47,580
I just wanna, I completely forgot

2565
01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:48,630
I want to ask you about this.

2566
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:52,418
The 7, 38, 55% rule.

2567
01:48:52,418 --> 01:48:53,251
(Chris laughs)

2568
01:48:53,251 --> 01:48:54,360
This is really interesting.

2569
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:55,193
Does this,

2570
01:48:55,193 --> 01:48:57,162
is there at all truth to it,

2571
01:48:57,162 --> 01:49:00,450
that 7% of a message is conveyed from the words used,

2572
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:02,217
38% from the tone of voice,

2573
01:49:02,217 --> 01:49:04,503
and 55% from body language?

2574
01:49:05,700 --> 01:49:06,717
Is there really truth to that?

2575
01:49:06,717 --> 01:49:09,463
- All right, so Albert Mehrabian,

2576
01:49:09,463 --> 01:49:13,890
I think is the name of the UCLA professor

2577
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:15,030
that originally proposed

2578
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:18,750
the 7, 38, 55 ratio and discussed it

2579
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:21,840
in terms of that it wasn't the message,

2580
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:25,050
but how much the, he called it liking,

2581
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,670
like are you, not that you're,

2582
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:27,900
the meaning is coming across,

2583
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:29,760
but your liking of the message.

2584
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,200
And so it's been extrapolated heavily

2585
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,380
by people like me

2586
01:49:37,890 --> 01:49:40,170
to this meaning of the meaning,

2587
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:42,813
in 7, 38, 55, from liking to the meaning.

2588
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:45,240
What I've seen regularly

2589
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:49,320
is people that communicate verbally,

2590
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:52,200
if they're speakers, Tony Robbins,

2591
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:54,630
7, 38, 55 guy,

2592
01:49:54,630 --> 01:49:56,163
he throws the ratio out there.

2593
01:49:58,050 --> 01:50:00,030
Go, "That's it exactly.

2594
01:50:00,030 --> 01:50:02,430
That's exactly how the message comes across.

2595
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:04,560
This is how we gotta balance it,

2596
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:05,960
this is how we gotta do it."

2597
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:09,873
Those that communicate principally in writing,

2598
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:14,223
the meaning of the words are much more important to them,

2599
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:17,490
so they're deeply uncomfortable

2600
01:50:17,490 --> 01:50:19,920
with 7 being the words,

2601
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,150
'cause the content, the words,

2602
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:22,890
the meaning of the words when you're writing,

2603
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:27,870
it's so important that you hate to poo poo it that way.

2604
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:29,337
So I, first of all,

2605
01:50:29,337 --> 01:50:32,280
I 1,000% believe it's an accurate ratio,

2606
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,690
but the real critical issue

2607
01:50:33,690 --> 01:50:36,930
is not what the ratio of those three things are,

2608
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:39,873
it's what's the message when they're outta line?

2609
01:50:40,980 --> 01:50:41,940
Like, what's the message

2610
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:44,850
when the tone of voice is outta line with the words?

2611
01:50:44,850 --> 01:50:46,500
Like, it don't matter what your ratio is,

2612
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:48,960
you got a problem if their tone

2613
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:51,090
does not match their words.

2614
01:50:51,090 --> 01:50:55,680
- And that's hard to really put a measure on exactly.

2615
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:57,870
Even in writing there's a tone.

2616
01:50:57,870 --> 01:50:59,460
I mean, it's not just, even in writing,

2617
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:01,260
it's not just the words, there's the words,

2618
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:04,140
but there's like a style underneath the whole thing.

2619
01:51:04,140 --> 01:51:06,090
And there's something like body language,

2620
01:51:06,090 --> 01:51:07,170
the presentation of the whole thing.

2621
01:51:07,170 --> 01:51:09,510
I mean, they're, yeah, I'm a big fan

2622
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:12,300
of constraint mediums of communication,

2623
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:15,900
which writing is, or voice, like Clubhouse.

2624
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:17,430
There's a personality to a human being

2625
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:19,440
when you just hear their voice.

2626
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:22,530
That there's, it's not just, it's, you could say,

2627
01:51:22,530 --> 01:51:23,820
it's the tone of voice, but there's like,

2628
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:25,290
you can, like, what is it?

2629
01:51:25,290 --> 01:51:28,050
The imagination fills in the rest.

2630
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,640
Like when I'm listening to somebody,

2631
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:33,273
I'm like, I'm imagining some amorphous being

2632
01:51:33,273 --> 01:51:35,160
like doing things, when they get angry,

2633
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:36,660
I'm imagining anger.

2634
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:38,220
I don't know what exactly I'm visualizing.

2635
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:41,100
- If you, well, and so you may think of a funny story

2636
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:43,230
'cause we were talking about your buddy Elon before.

2637
01:51:43,230 --> 01:51:45,180
And I told you, you know, about, you know,

2638
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:48,390
that I'd interacted with some of the senior executives.

2639
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:51,900
So I know that they love working with him.

2640
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:53,490
And they think he's an interesting guy

2641
01:51:53,490 --> 01:51:54,323
and they realized that he could be funny,

2642
01:51:54,323 --> 01:51:56,370
you know, he jokes around.

2643
01:51:56,370 --> 01:51:58,080
So they're telling me,

2644
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:00,783
they're on this conference call, just words.

2645
01:52:01,890 --> 01:52:05,043
And a guy on the other end of the line says something,

2646
01:52:06,330 --> 01:52:10,623
you know, that wasn't, was wrong but wasn't bad.

2647
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,800
And so they said they're on a phone

2648
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:15,150
and Elon goes, "You're fired!"

2649
01:52:15,150 --> 01:52:16,650
And then everybody in the room with him

2650
01:52:16,650 --> 01:52:17,943
can see that he's joking.

2651
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:21,270
But the person on the other side can't,

2652
01:52:21,270 --> 01:52:22,860
and they're all going, "Wait, wait, wait, wait,

2653
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:24,147
they can't see your look on your face right now.

2654
01:52:24,147 --> 01:52:25,350
You gotta stop, you gotta stop,

2655
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:27,720
'cause the guy on the other side is dying right now.

2656
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:29,640
He doesn't realize you're joking."

2657
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:30,480
So there was, you know,

2658
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,790
there were the words and the tone of voice,

2659
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:35,728
but it lacked the visual to go with it.

2660
01:52:35,728 --> 01:52:39,150
- (laughs) Nevertheless it was probably funny.

2661
01:52:39,150 --> 01:52:42,033
- I'm sure it was very funny at the time.

2662
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:43,863
- Maybe not to him.

2663
01:52:45,390 --> 01:52:47,040
Just as a interesting to ask,

2664
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:48,480
I don't know if you're following along

2665
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:50,820
the developments of large language models,

2666
01:52:50,820 --> 01:52:52,980
there's been something called ChatGPT.

2667
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:57,060
There's just more and more sophisticated

2668
01:52:57,060 --> 01:53:01,140
and effective and impressive chatbots essentially,

2669
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:04,470
they can talk, and they're becoming

2670
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:05,763
more and more human-like.

2671
01:53:06,914 --> 01:53:09,660
Do you think it's possible in the future

2672
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:13,360
that AI will be able to be better negotiators

2673
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:15,870
than humans?

2674
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:18,060
Do you think about that kind of stuff?

2675
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:22,353
- Well, so definition of better versus less flawed.

2676
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:25,230
Like, there, you know, chatbots

2677
01:53:25,230 --> 01:53:26,490
have been out there for a long time

2678
01:53:26,490 --> 01:53:31,443
and probably about five years ago now,

2679
01:53:32,580 --> 01:53:33,960
a company approached us

2680
01:53:33,960 --> 01:53:36,870
'cause they were doing a negotiation chatbot.

2681
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:38,520
And they said two things.

2682
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:40,174
First of all, I said,

2683
01:53:40,174 --> 01:53:41,027
you know, "Why are you talking to us?"

2684
01:53:41,027 --> 01:53:43,440
Said, "Well, on point of fact,

2685
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,850
we already spoke to the people

2686
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:48,690
that are teaching quote 'The Harvard methodology.'

2687
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:50,340
And you know, the rational approach

2688
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:51,960
to negotiation just doesn't work.

2689
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:54,210
The rational approach just does not work.

2690
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:56,550
Our chatbots are not getting anywhere.

2691
01:53:56,550 --> 01:53:59,790
But we're showing in around

2692
01:53:59,790 --> 01:54:01,660
about 80% of the interactions

2693
01:54:02,670 --> 01:54:04,970
a higher success outcome with these chatbots."

2694
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:08,280
And they showed me what they were doing

2695
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:11,340
and it was still a lot deeply flawed

2696
01:54:11,340 --> 01:54:13,500
emotional intelligence wise.

2697
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:15,090
But the reason why that they were having

2698
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:17,460
a higher success rates is the chatbots

2699
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:18,710
were never in a bad mood.

2700
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,240
And you could reach out for chatbot

2701
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,400
in the middle of the night.

2702
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:26,160
So if you were talking to somebody that was never upset

2703
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,573
and was always available,

2704
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:30,660
then you're gonna have a higher success rate.

2705
01:54:30,660 --> 01:54:32,430
Negotiations go bad when people are

2706
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:34,050
in a negative frame of mind.

2707
01:54:34,050 --> 01:54:36,850
- So the natural ability

2708
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,900
of a chatbot to be positive

2709
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:43,260
is just going to give you a higher success rate.

2710
01:54:43,260 --> 01:54:45,330
- Yeah, and they're not gonna get mad

2711
01:54:45,330 --> 01:54:46,230
and argue with you.

2712
01:54:46,230 --> 01:54:47,963
You know, you say to a chatbot, you know,

2713
01:54:49,147 --> 01:54:51,300
"Your price is too high."

2714
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:54,390
Chatbot is designed to come back with a smiley face.

2715
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:56,659
You say to a person, "Your price is too high."

2716
01:54:56,659 --> 01:54:58,860
They go, "How dare you, I'm trying to make a living."

2717
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:00,690
You know? They're gonna go off the deep end.

2718
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:02,310
- Unfortunately, or fortunately,

2719
01:55:02,310 --> 01:55:03,990
I think the way chatbots are going now,

2720
01:55:03,990 --> 01:55:05,850
they will come back negative,

2721
01:55:05,850 --> 01:55:07,770
because they're becoming more human,

2722
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:10,020
more and more human-like, that's the whole point.

2723
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:11,550
To be able to pass the Turing Test,

2724
01:55:11,550 --> 01:55:14,220
you have to be negative, you have to be an asshole,

2725
01:55:14,220 --> 01:55:16,440
you have to have boundaries, you have to be insecure,

2726
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:18,930
you have to have some uncertainty.

2727
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:21,450
- Well, there's a difference between having boundaries

2728
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:22,890
and being negative.

2729
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:26,163
Like, I can, like you throw a proposal to me,

2730
01:55:28,230 --> 01:55:31,357
you know, before I say no, I'm gonna say,

2731
01:55:31,357 --> 01:55:34,500
"Look, I'm sorry, that just doesn't work for me."

2732
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:37,230
I'm gonna set up a real clear boundary

2733
01:55:37,230 --> 01:55:38,433
without being negative.

2734
01:55:41,031 --> 01:55:46,031
And a lot of people really struggle with setting boundaries

2735
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,360
without being negative, without name calling,

2736
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:50,763
without indignation, without getting upset.

2737
01:55:51,870 --> 01:55:54,543
- But see there's a, when you are,

2738
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:58,563
when you show that you're not getting upset,

2739
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:01,023
I'm not just seeing that,

2740
01:56:02,177 --> 01:56:03,790
I'm seeing a flawed human

2741
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:07,170
that has underneath it a temper,

2742
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:10,080
underneath it the ability to get upset,

2743
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,300
but chooses not to get upset.

2744
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,160
And a chatbot has to demonstrate that.

2745
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:16,380
So it's not just going to be cold,

2746
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:20,910
and, you know, be this kind of corporate

2747
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:23,550
blank empty

2748
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:27,397
sort of like vapid creature that just says,

2749
01:56:27,397 --> 01:56:29,940
"Oh, thank you, thank you for saying that."

2750
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:33,567
No, it's basically you have to,

2751
01:56:33,567 --> 01:56:38,310
the chatbot has to be able to be mean

2752
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:39,783
and choose not to be.

2753
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:42,020
- Interesting. I don't know.

2754
01:56:43,620 --> 01:56:48,120
I'd be willing to see that play out

2755
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:49,860
and see how it plays out.

2756
01:56:49,860 --> 01:56:52,140
- But I guess what I'm saying is to be a good negotiator,

2757
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:54,870
you have to be, have the capacity

2758
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:56,640
to be a bad person and choose not to.

2759
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,993
- Really? - I think so.

2760
01:56:58,860 --> 01:57:00,810
- See, I think you just gotta have the capacity

2761
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:02,510
to set a boundary and stick to it.

2762
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,793
- Interesting.

2763
01:57:04,793 --> 01:57:07,530
'Cause I think, it's hard for me to trust a person

2764
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:09,483
who's not aware of their own demons.

2765
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:13,410
'Cause if you say you don't have any demons,

2766
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:16,500
if you don't have any flaws, I can't trust you.

2767
01:57:16,500 --> 01:57:18,090
- Yeah, well, first of all, it's a lie, right?

2768
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:19,467
So somebody's lying.

2769
01:57:19,467 --> 01:57:20,940
It goes back to lying.

2770
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:23,733
- Yes, so you have to have a self-awareness about that,

2771
01:57:25,290 --> 01:57:26,370
but you'd be able to control it

2772
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:27,563
and demonstrate that you're able to control it.

2773
01:57:27,563 --> 01:57:28,920
I mean, this is humans.

2774
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:30,810
I just think humans,

2775
01:57:30,810 --> 01:57:33,840
intelligent, effective humans are able to do this well

2776
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:36,840
and chatbots are not yet,

2777
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,250
and they're moving in that direction.

2778
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:42,600
So it makes me think about what is actually required

2779
01:57:42,600 --> 01:57:43,890
for effective negotiation.

2780
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:45,600
That's what AI systems do,

2781
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:49,200
is they make you ask yourself,

2782
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:52,980
what is it that makes humans special at any discipline?

2783
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:56,310
What is it that makes humans special at chess and Go games,

2784
01:57:56,310 --> 01:58:00,030
which AI systems are able to beat humans at now.

2785
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:03,390
What is it that makes them effective at negotiation?

2786
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:05,223
What does it make them effective at,

2787
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:08,970
something that's extremely difficult,

2788
01:58:08,970 --> 01:58:12,150
which is navigating physical spaces.

2789
01:58:12,150 --> 01:58:13,740
So doing things that we take for granted,

2790
01:58:13,740 --> 01:58:15,660
like making yourself a cup of coffee

2791
01:58:15,660 --> 01:58:19,470
is a exceptionally difficult problem for robots.

2792
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:23,070
Because of all the complexities involved

2793
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:25,950
in navigating physical reality.

2794
01:58:25,950 --> 01:58:30,240
We have so much common sense reasoning built in,

2795
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:32,280
just about how gravity works,

2796
01:58:32,280 --> 01:58:37,023
about how objects move,

2797
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:41,740
what kind of objects there are in the world.

2798
01:58:43,197 --> 01:58:44,490
It's really difficult to describe

2799
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:46,470
because it all seems so damn trivial,

2800
01:58:46,470 --> 01:58:48,210
but it's not trivial.

2801
01:58:48,210 --> 01:58:50,940
Because a lot of that we just learn as babies,

2802
01:58:50,940 --> 01:58:52,470
we keep running into things

2803
01:58:52,470 --> 01:58:53,730
and we'll learn about that.

2804
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:56,250
And so AI systems help us understand

2805
01:58:56,250 --> 01:58:58,590
what is it that makes humans really,

2806
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:00,870
what is the wisdom we have in our heads?

2807
01:59:00,870 --> 01:59:03,630
And negotiation to me is super interesting.

2808
01:59:03,630 --> 01:59:06,570
'Cause negotiation is not, it's about business,

2809
01:59:06,570 --> 01:59:09,900
it's about geopolitics,

2810
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:12,210
it's about running government.

2811
01:59:12,210 --> 01:59:13,647
It's basically negotiating how do we,

2812
01:59:13,647 --> 01:59:17,070
the different policies, different bills

2813
01:59:17,070 --> 01:59:18,960
and programs and so on.

2814
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,403
How do we allocate money?

2815
01:59:21,300 --> 01:59:23,370
How do we reallocate resources?

2816
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:24,480
All that kind of stuff.

2817
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:26,190
That seems like AI in the future

2818
01:59:26,190 --> 01:59:29,313
could be better at that, but maybe not.

2819
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:34,110
Maybe you have to be a messy, weird, insecure,

2820
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:36,600
uncertain human and debate each other

2821
01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:38,300
and yell at each other on Twitter.

2822
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:42,600
Maybe you have to have the red and the blue teams

2823
01:59:42,600 --> 01:59:46,590
that yell at each other in the process

2824
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:48,420
of figuring out what is true.

2825
01:59:48,420 --> 01:59:51,241
Maybe AI systems will not be able to do that,

2826
01:59:51,241 --> 01:59:55,140
you know, figure out the full mess of human civilization.

2827
01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:55,973
- Yeah, interesting.

2828
01:59:55,973 --> 01:59:57,210
Well, I mean the two thoughts

2829
01:59:57,210 --> 02:00:00,450
that I had along the way was, I mean,

2830
02:00:00,450 --> 02:00:02,850
anytime you're talking about systems or scaling,

2831
02:00:04,670 --> 02:00:06,420
you know, you're talking,

2832
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:10,920
my belief is chatbots systems,

2833
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,350
things that don't require decision making,

2834
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:14,943
just following instructions,

2835
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,153
at least 80% of what's going on.

2836
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:22,710
Now, the remaining percentage, whatever it is,

2837
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:27,090
does it require the human interaction and what's required?

2838
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:30,900
Like I'm not like, I am not pro conflict.

2839
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:33,810
And I also know that there's a case to be made

2840
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,810
in the creative world that some of the best thinking

2841
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:38,043
came outta conflict.

2842
02:00:40,410 --> 02:00:42,110
Reading interviews of Bono and U2.

2843
02:00:43,290 --> 02:00:45,660
You know, their admiration

2844
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:48,000
for some of the Beatles best music

2845
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,310
came when they were fighting with each other.

2846
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:53,250
And the song "One,"

2847
02:00:53,250 --> 02:00:56,220
which is I believe from the album "Achtung Baby."

2848
02:00:56,220 --> 02:00:57,900
Those guys were fighting.

2849
02:00:57,900 --> 02:01:00,300
I mean, they were on the verge of breaking up,

2850
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:02,040
and their appreciation that conflict

2851
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:03,690
could create something beautiful.

2852
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:06,900
And then when I was in the crisis negotiation unit,

2853
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:09,330
you know, my last seven years in the FBI,

2854
02:01:09,330 --> 02:01:13,500
there was a guy named Vince, brilliant dude, brilliant,

2855
02:01:13,500 --> 02:01:15,360
brilliant negotiator.

2856
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,373
And he and I used to argue all the time.

2857
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:20,880
And then when we had a change

2858
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:22,623
in the guy who was in charge,

2859
02:01:23,490 --> 02:01:25,346
the guy who was in charge took me off to the side

2860
02:01:25,346 --> 02:01:26,670
and he is like, you know, "I can't take you

2861
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:28,320
and Vince fighting all the time."

2862
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:30,960
And I said, "Well, I got news for you.

2863
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:32,790
I think we come up with much better stuff

2864
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:34,800
as a result of our battles."

2865
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:35,633
And he said, "You know,

2866
02:01:35,633 --> 02:01:37,650
Vince said the same thing to me."

2867
02:01:37,650 --> 02:01:38,483
And I'm like, "So, well,

2868
02:01:38,483 --> 02:01:39,450
if we don't have a problem fighting,

2869
02:01:39,450 --> 02:01:41,427
why do you have a problem with it?"

2870
02:01:42,390 --> 02:01:44,760
But you know, there is something there

2871
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:49,170
that sometimes the most difficult insights,

2872
02:01:49,170 --> 02:01:51,210
you rack your brains as to why someone

2873
02:01:51,210 --> 02:01:54,510
is so dug in on something

2874
02:01:54,510 --> 02:01:57,630
that so many of you think is so wrong.

2875
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:58,890
Yeah, maybe there's something to it.

2876
02:01:58,890 --> 02:02:00,150
I think there's something to it.

2877
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:01,770
- There's something about conflict,

2878
02:02:01,770 --> 02:02:03,810
even drama that might be a feature,

2879
02:02:03,810 --> 02:02:05,940
not a bug of our society.

2880
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,040
- [Chris] Interesting.

2881
02:02:08,070 --> 02:02:10,500
- Do you think there'll always be war in the world?

2882
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:11,975
- Yeah.

2883
02:02:11,975 --> 02:02:14,392
(Lex laughs)

2884
02:02:15,360 --> 02:02:18,030
- So there'll always be a need for negotiators

2885
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:18,930
and negotiating.

2886
02:02:18,930 --> 02:02:20,673
- Well, as it turns out.

2887
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:25,200
- Why do you think there'll always be war?

2888
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:27,900
What's your intuition about human nature there?

2889
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:30,840
- Yeah, just because we're basically 75% negative

2890
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:34,500
and then, for lack of a better term,

2891
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:36,510
I call it two lines of code.

2892
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:39,120
Like somewhere when you, everybody, when we were little,

2893
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:41,760
somebody planted in two lines into our head.

2894
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,510
We don't know when it got in there.

2895
02:02:44,580 --> 02:02:47,343
But somebody said something to us that stuck.

2896
02:02:48,720 --> 02:02:50,040
And there are a lot of people

2897
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:54,040
that had some really negative garbage dumped in their brain

2898
02:02:54,930 --> 02:02:56,403
when they were little.

2899
02:02:57,810 --> 02:03:01,923
And just based on the numbers.

2900
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:06,120
What kind of opportunity they were given afterwards.

2901
02:03:06,120 --> 02:03:08,880
Did they ever have an epiphany moment

2902
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:10,380
when they genuinely believe

2903
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:12,600
they can get themselves out of it?

2904
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,360
Like what is it, one of Joe Dispenza's book

2905
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:17,460
is "Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself."

2906
02:03:18,883 --> 02:03:21,633
You know, like how do you get at that two lines of code

2907
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:25,620
that either mean or well-intentioned,

2908
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:27,930
but stupidly speaking adult said to you

2909
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:30,360
at the wrong moment and planted in your brain?

2910
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:33,360
Like, the chances of everybody on Earth

2911
02:03:33,360 --> 02:03:34,193
getting that out.

2912
02:03:34,193 --> 02:03:35,460
Even the majority of people on Earth,

2913
02:03:35,460 --> 02:03:37,893
getting that out of their heads is really small.

2914
02:03:39,780 --> 02:03:42,930
- What advice would you give to a young person today

2915
02:03:42,930 --> 02:03:45,390
about how to have a career they could be proud of

2916
02:03:45,390 --> 02:03:48,750
or a life, maybe somebody in high school,

2917
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:51,933
college, trying to figure out their way in this world?

2918
02:03:53,608 --> 02:03:55,590
- Yeah, it's probably a take on a cliche

2919
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:57,420
of do what you love.

2920
02:03:57,420 --> 02:04:02,420
But if you figure out your ideals

2921
02:04:03,450 --> 02:04:05,790
and pursue your ideals

2922
02:04:05,790 --> 02:04:09,393
and stick to 'em when it costs you.

2923
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:12,330
Like a guy I admire very much,

2924
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:16,380
Michael Mogill runs this operation,

2925
02:04:16,380 --> 02:04:18,990
Crisp Video at Atlanta.

2926
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:20,107
In one of his talks, he would say,

2927
02:04:20,107 --> 02:04:23,793
"Core values are what you stick to that cost you money.

2928
02:04:25,140 --> 02:04:27,810
It's not a value that really matters to you

2929
02:04:27,810 --> 02:04:32,810
unless it's costing you and stick to your values."

2930
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:37,268
Now, when I was in the FBI, I worked really hard at,

2931
02:04:37,268 --> 02:04:39,480
you know, the number one core mission of the FBI

2932
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:41,580
is protect and defend the American people.

2933
02:04:43,590 --> 02:04:48,453
So I could pursue that value at all times, which I did,

2934
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:51,303
or I could follow the rules.

2935
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,423
You don't have time to do both.

2936
02:04:56,453 --> 02:05:01,143
- (laughs) When did you know you found what you love?

2937
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:06,450
Like, when did you fall in love

2938
02:05:06,450 --> 02:05:09,633
with whatever this process is that is negotiating?

2939
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:13,860
- I think it was in a conversation

2940
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:16,500
on the suicide hotline that I was telling you about earlier

2941
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,003
with the guy who was paranoid.

2942
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:22,410
When I thought, I can have that significant of an impact

2943
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:25,863
on another human being in this short of a period of time,

2944
02:05:26,984 --> 02:05:28,473
that's really cool.

2945
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:32,070
- How hard is it to talk somebody off the ledge?

2946
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:35,790
So this question, is a big question.

2947
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:37,173
Why the hell live at all?

2948
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:43,170
How do you have that kind of deeply philosophical,

2949
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:46,053
deeply psychological and also practical conversation

2950
02:05:46,053 --> 02:05:48,090
with somebody and convince them

2951
02:05:48,090 --> 02:05:49,410
they should stick around?

2952
02:05:49,410 --> 02:05:54,410
- Well, it's more clearing the clutter in their head.

2953
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:58,140
And let 'em make up their own mind.

2954
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:00,510
That was what volunteering on the suicide hotline

2955
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:01,343
was really about.

2956
02:06:01,343 --> 02:06:02,790
Just let me help, let me see

2957
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:06,240
how quickly I can clear out the clutter in your head

2958
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:08,970
if you're willing to have it cleared out.

2959
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:10,860
Like, did you call here

2960
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:13,680
'cause you are actually looking for help?

2961
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:18,363
Or did you call here to fulfill some other agenda?

2962
02:06:19,890 --> 02:06:22,800
So are, you know, are you willing to have,

2963
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:24,720
are you willing to clear the clutter in your head?

2964
02:06:24,720 --> 02:06:26,190
Not everybody is.

2965
02:06:26,190 --> 02:06:28,410
- So once you clear out the clutter

2966
02:06:28,410 --> 02:06:31,530
is there at least somewhat hopeful chance

2967
02:06:31,530 --> 02:06:34,290
that you'll continue for another day.

2968
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:35,520
- Yeah.

2969
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:39,120
And like, if you step back,

2970
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:42,220
like very few people that commit suicide

2971
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:47,313
physically are up against it that hard.

2972
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:50,850
Like most of them by and large

2973
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:53,970
are pretty intact physically human beings,

2974
02:06:53,970 --> 02:06:55,970
they're struggling with emotional stuff.

2975
02:06:56,820 --> 02:07:00,000
But it's an emotional issue.

2976
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,800
It's not a physical issue.

2977
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:03,900
So if you were to be a complete mercenary,

2978
02:07:03,900 --> 02:07:05,980
like a guy I'm a very big fan of,

2979
02:07:05,980 --> 02:07:10,380
a guy named Mark Pollock, born a great athlete,

2980
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:13,590
lost his eyesight and then became paralyzed.

2981
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:18,420
Like, he's an emotional leader.

2982
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:22,983
He's about helping people thrive and live great lives.

2983
02:07:24,810 --> 02:07:28,630
Like Mark was born, he was a spectacular athlete

2984
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,830
and first he lost his sight in one eye,

2985
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:34,230
then he lost his sight in the other eye,

2986
02:07:34,230 --> 02:07:38,040
and then he fell out a window in a tragic experience.

2987
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:38,940
Like, if there was ever a dude

2988
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:41,637
that was saying like, "Living sucks."

2989
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:45,180
You know, "And if there's any doubt in my mind,

2990
02:07:45,180 --> 02:07:48,090
something worse happens to me every few years."

2991
02:07:48,090 --> 02:07:51,753
But Mark's about being alive and inspiring other people.

2992
02:07:52,740 --> 02:07:55,110
So the hard part with navigating with somebody

2993
02:07:55,110 --> 02:07:58,320
who's tossing it in because there's a chemical imbalance,

2994
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:01,260
or they're, it's the way they're interpreting the world.

2995
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:03,570
There's clutter in their head.

2996
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:06,810
Like, how can you help clear that clutter in their head?

2997
02:08:06,810 --> 02:08:10,530
- And help 'em by themselves,

2998
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:13,290
inspire them to reinterpret that world,

2999
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:14,703
as one worth living in.

3000
02:08:17,130 --> 02:08:19,410
What do you think is the meaning of life?

3001
02:08:19,410 --> 02:08:23,203
Chris Voss, why live? (laughs)

3002
02:08:24,626 --> 02:08:25,530
What's a good reason?

3003
02:08:25,530 --> 02:08:30,063
- Well, I have very strong religious beliefs.

3004
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:36,030
Spiritual, you know, I don't 1,000%,

3005
02:08:36,030 --> 02:08:38,283
if you were to try to confine me in a box,

3006
02:08:40,080 --> 02:08:41,277
I'd be a Christian.

3007
02:08:41,277 --> 02:08:43,860
And I have tremendous respect for the Jewish.

3008
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:47,220
I don't think any religion's got it nailed exactly.

3009
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:49,530
I'm, again, you know, I keep mentioning him,

3010
02:08:49,530 --> 02:08:50,880
I'm kind of a Bono Christian.

3011
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:53,193
I think Bono's, he's like, what?

3012
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,970
And I'm gonna butcher it.

3013
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:58,860
But, you know, "My belief in Jesus

3014
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:01,050
is what I've got after Christianity leaves a room."

3015
02:09:01,050 --> 02:09:02,310
You know, the Dogma,

3016
02:09:02,310 --> 02:09:04,803
man's application of spiritual beliefs.

3017
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,170
So, but that being said,

3018
02:09:07,170 --> 02:09:09,870
I truly believe that my life was a gift

3019
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:13,200
and there's a purpose here and, you know,

3020
02:09:13,200 --> 02:09:15,570
my creator decided that I woke up in the morning

3021
02:09:15,570 --> 02:09:17,550
'cause he still had some cool, interesting things

3022
02:09:17,550 --> 02:09:18,383
for me to do.

3023
02:09:19,717 --> 02:09:22,800
- And you have gratitude for having the opportunity

3024
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,153
to live that day. - Yeah.

3025
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:29,850
- Well, you do one heck of a good job at living those days.

3026
02:09:29,850 --> 02:09:31,080
I really appreciate your work.

3027
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:33,120
I appreciate the person you are.

3028
02:09:33,120 --> 02:09:36,930
Thank you for just everything you've done today,

3029
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:38,580
for just being empathic.

3030
02:09:38,580 --> 02:09:40,200
Honestly, you're a great listener,

3031
02:09:40,200 --> 02:09:42,180
you're a great conversationalist.

3032
02:09:42,180 --> 02:09:44,340
It's such an honor to meet you and to talk to you.

3033
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:45,450
This was really awesome, Chris.

3034
02:09:45,450 --> 02:09:47,100
- Been my pleasure.

3035
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:48,600
- Thanks for listening to this conversation

3036
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:49,740
with Chris Voss.

And now let me leave you with some words

3040
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:56,973
from John F. Kennedy.

3041
02:09:57,907 --> 02:10:00,243
"Let us never negotiate out of fear,

3042
02:10:01,230 --> 02:10:05,190
but let us never fear to negotiate."

3043
02:10:05,190 --> 02:10:06,180
Thank you for listening

3044
02:10:06,180 --> 02:10:08,043
and hope to see you next time.
