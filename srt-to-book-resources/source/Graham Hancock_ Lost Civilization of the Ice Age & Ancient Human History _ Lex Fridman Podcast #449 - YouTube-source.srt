1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:00,079
..

2
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:04,038
. the big question for me in that timeline is why didn't we do it sooner?

3
00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:05,219
Why did it take so long?

4
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,639
Why did we wait until after 12,000 years ago

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,759
really after 10,000 years ago, to start seeing the beginnings of civilization?

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,379
The following is a conversation with Graham Hancock

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:21,899
a journalist and author who, for over 30 years

8
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:31,999
has explored the controversial possibility that there existed a lost civilization during the last Ice Age and that it was destroyed in a global cataclysm some 12

9
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:33,200
000 years ago.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,699
He is the presenter of the Netflix documentary series Ancient Apocalypse

11
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:46,100
the second season of which has just been released and it's focused on the distant past of the Americas

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,919
a topic I recently discussed with the archeologist Ed Barnhart.

13
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:56,559
Let me say that Ed represents the kind of archeologist

14
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,599
scholar, I love talking to on the podcast.

15
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:04,899
Extremely knowledgeable, humble, open-minded, and respectful in disagreement.

16
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,499
I'll do many more podcasts on history, including ancient history.

17
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:20,919
Our distant past is full of mysteries and I find it truly exciting to explore those mysteries with people both on the inside and the outside of the mainstream

18
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:23,159
in the various disciplines involved.

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,739
This is a Lex Fridman podcast.

20
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:29,979
To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description and now

21
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:33,179
dear friends, here's Graham Hancock.

22
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:38,059
Let's start with a big foundational idea that you have about human history

23
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:49,219
that there was a, an advanced Ice Age civilization that came before and perhaps seeded what people now call the six cradles of civilization: Mesopotamia

24
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:52,139
Egypt, India, China, Andes, and Mesoamerica.

25
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:54,419
So let's talk about this idea that you have.

26
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:54,739
Mm-hmm.

27
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,179
Can you, at the highest possible level

28
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:56,759
describe it?

29
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,919
It would be better to describe it as a foundational sense of puzzlement and incompleteness

30
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,899
uh, in the story that we are taught about our past

31
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,459
which envisages more or less there have been a few ups and downs

32
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,719
but more or less a straightforward evolutionary progress.

33
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:26,939
Uh, we start out as hunter-foragers then we become agriculturalists.

34
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,119
The hunter-fother- forager phase could go back hundreds of thousands of years.

35
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,119
Uh, I mean this is where it's also

36
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,759
it's also important to mention that anatomically modern humans

37
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,079
um, were not the only humans.

38
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,299
We, we had Neanderthals from, I don't know

39
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:44,439
400,000 years ago to about 40,000 years ago.

40
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,959
They were certainly human because anatomically modern humans interbred with them and we carry

41
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:51,899
we carry Neanderthal genes.

42
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:57,229
There were the Denisovans maybe 300,000 to perhaps even as recently as 30

43
00:02:57,229 --> 00:03:00,059
000 years ago and again interbreeding took place.

44
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,839
They're obviously a human species so, you know

45
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:08,199
we've got this background of humans who didn't look quite like us

46
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:20,424
and then we have anatomically modern humans and I think the earliest anatomically modern human skeletal remains are from Jebel Irhoud in Morocco and date to about 310

47
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:21,699
000 years ago.

48
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:27,039
So the question is what were our ancestors doing after that?

49
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,179
And I think we can include the Neanderthals and the Denisovans in that

50
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,319
in that general picture.

51
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,559
And why did it take so long?

52
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,279
This is one of the puzzles, one of the questions that bother me.

53
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:41,559
Why did it take so long when we have creatures who are physically identical to us?

54
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,819
We, we cannot actually weigh and measure their brains

55
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:46,559
but from the work that's been done on

56
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,719
on the crania it looks like they had the same brains that we do with the same

57
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,299
the same wiring.

58
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,899
So, so if we've been around, uh

59
00:03:53,899 --> 00:04:00,239
for 300,000-plus years at least and if ultimately in our future

60
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,259
uh, was, uh, the, the, the process to create civilization or civilizations

61
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:07,519
why didn't it happen sooner?

62
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,619
Why did it take so long?

63
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,479
Why, why, why was it such a long time?

64
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,539
Even the story of, of anatomically modern humans has kept on changing.

65
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:20,418
Um, I, I remember a time when it was said that there hadn't been anatomically modern humans before 50

66
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:23,507
000 years ago and then it became 196

67
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:27,876
000 years ago with the findings in Ethiopia and then 310

68
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:29,339
000 years ago.

69
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,839
Um, there, there's a lot of, a lot of missing pieces in the

70
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,999
in the puzzle there.

71
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:39,919
Um, but the big question for me in that timeline is why didn't we do it sooner?

72
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,079
Why did it take so long?

73
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,649
Why, why, why did we wait until after 12

74
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,559
000 years ago, really after 10,000 years ago to start seeing the beginnings

75
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:51,459
what are selected as the beginnings of civilization

76
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,219
uh, in, in places like, like Turkey

77
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:54,939
for example?

78
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,799
And then there's a relatively slow process of adopting agriculture and

79
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:03,399
and by 6,000 years ago we see ancient Sumer

80
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,919
uh, emerging as a civilization.

81
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,079
And w- we're then in the Predynastic period in Ancient Egypt as well

82
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:17,159
6,000, 6,000 years ago beginning to see definite signs of what will become the

83
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:20,223
the Dynastic civilization of Egypt about, about 5

84
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:21,139
000 years ago.

85
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:28,479
And interestingly, round about the same time you have the Indus Valley civilization popping up out of nowhere

86
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
and, and by the way, the Indus Valley civilization was a lost civilization

87
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,239
uh, until the 1920s when, uh, railway workers accidentally stumbled across some

88
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,159
some ruins.

89
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,259
I've been to Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, uh

90
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,619
and these are extraordinarily beautifully, centrally planned

91
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:47,279
uh, cities.

92
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,279
These, th- clearly they're the work of a

93
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,579
an already sophisticated, uh, civilization.

94
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:56,879
One of the things that strikes me about the Indus Valley civilization is that we find a

95
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,859
a steatite seal, uh, of an individual seated in a

96
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:04,139
a recognizable yoga posture and that seal is 5

97
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,772
000 years old, uh, and the yoga posture is Mulabandhasana which involves.

98
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:08,962
..

99
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:09,152
..

100
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:13,387
. a real contortion of the ankles and twisting the f- feet back.

101
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:15,287
It's an advanced yoga posture.

102
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,267
So there it is 5,000 years ago and that then raises the question

103
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:23,172
well, how long did yoga take to get to that place when it was already so advanced 5- 5

104
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:23,827
000 years ago?

105
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:25,947
What's the, what's the background to this?

106
00:06:25,947 --> 00:06:28,667
China, the Yellow, the Yellow River, uh

107
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:29,347
civilization.

108
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,067
Again, it's around about the same period.

109
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:36,168
Five to 6,000 years ago you get these first signs of something happening so it's very odd that

110
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:39,447
that all around the world, uh, we have this

111
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:43,048
this sudden upsurge of civilization about 6,000 years ago

112
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:48,368
preceded by what seems like a, a natural evolutionary process that would lead to a

113
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:49,567
to a civilization.

114
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:56,267
Um, and yet certain ideas being, being carried down and manifested and expressed in

115
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:59,247
in many of these, in many of these different civilizations.

116
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:05,067
I just find that, that whole idea very puzzling and

117
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:15,567
and very, and very disturbing, uh, especially when I look at this radical break that takes place in not just the human story but the story of all life on Earth

118
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:18,788
which was the last great cataclysm that the earth went through

119
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:21,547
uh, which was the Younger Dryas event.

120
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:23,967
Uh, it was an extinction level event.

121
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:27,987
Uh, that's when all the great megafauna of the Ice Age went extinct.

122
00:07:27,987 --> 00:07:32,747
It's after that, it's, it's after that event that we start seeing this

123
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:37,487
what are, what are taken to be the beginnings of the first gradual steps towards civilization.

124
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,487
We come out of the Upper Paleolithic as it's defined

125
00:07:40,487 --> 00:07:42,847
the old f- end of the old Stone Age

126
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,287
and into the Neolithic.

127
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:49,407
And that's when the wheels are supposedly set in motion to start civilization rolling.

128
00:07:49,407 --> 00:07:51,868
But, but what happened before that and why did that

129
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,348
why did that suddenly happen then?

130
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,548
And I can't help feeling, and I've felt this for a very  long while

131
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:59,927
that there are major missing pieces in our story.

132
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:09,947
It's often said that I'm claiming to have proved that there was an advanced lost civilization in the Ice Age and I am not claiming to have proved that.

133
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,127
That is a hypothesis that I am putting forward

134
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:16,347
uh, to answer some of the questions that I have

135
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,647
uh, about, about pre-history.

136
00:08:18,647 --> 00:08:27,807
Um, and, and, um, I think it's worthwhile to inquire into those possibilities because the Younger Dryas event was

137
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,287
uh, a massive, uh, global cataclysm

138
00:08:31,287 --> 00:08:33,527
whatever caused it, uh, and, and

139
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:38,207
um, it's strange that just after it we start seeing these

140
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:39,307
these first signs.

141
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:52,207
So the current understanding in mainstream archeology is that after the Younger Dryas is when the civilizations popped up in different places of the globe with a lot of similarities

142
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,387
but they popped up independently from one another.

143
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:57,207
Yeah, independently and, and, um, by coincidence.

144
00:08:57,207 --> 00:09:01,967
And by coincidence those, the, those big civilizations that we all remember as the first civilizations

145
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:04,887
Sumer, Egypt, the Indus Valley civilization, China

146
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:07,607
they all pop up at the, pretty much the same time.

147
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,547
Um, that is, that i- that is the mainstream view

148
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:10,747
yeah.

149
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:11,987
And they don't just pop up.

150
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:14,387
They kind of build up gradually.

151
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,267
First there's some settlements- Oh, definitely.

152
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:16,567
Yes.

153
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:16,580
.

154
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:16,607
..

155
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:21,767
and then there's different dynamics of how they build up and the role d- the role of agriculture in that is

156
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:26,127
uh, also non-obvious, but it's just, there's a first

157
00:09:26,127 --> 00:09:29,627
a kind of settlement, a stabilization of where the people are living

158
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:33,607
then they start using agriculture, then they start getting urban centers and that kind of stuff.

159
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,507
It seems like an entirely reasonable argument.

160
00:09:35,507 --> 00:09:37,347
Every- everything, everything about that makes sense.

161
00:09:37,347 --> 00:09:39,307
There is no doubt that you're seeing, uh

162
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:47,287
evolutionary progress, uh, social evolution taking, taking place in those thousands of years before Sumer

163
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,627
uh, emerges.

164
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:58,487
But what's happening now, uh, r- really I spent much of the '90s and the late 1980s investigating this issue of a lost civilization.

165
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:00,087
I wrote a series of books about it.

166
00:10:00,087 --> 00:10:04,167
But by 2002 when I published a book called Underworld

167
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:10,067
which was the re- most massive and most heavy book that I've ever written because I was writing very defensively at the time.

168
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:21,867
Um, by the time I finished that book my wife Santa and I spent seven years scuba diving all around the world looking for structures underwater often led by local fishermen or local divers to anomalies that they'd seen underwater.

169
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,587
By the time that book was finished I

170
00:10:23,587 --> 00:10:25,747
I thought, "Actually I've done this story.

171
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:26,587
I've walked the walk.

172
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,592
I, I really don't have much more to say about it.

173
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:31,507
" And I, I, I turned e- in another direction and I

174
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:35,727
I wrote a book called Supernatural Meetings with the Ancient Teachers of Mankind

175
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:38,327
recently retitled, uh, Visionary.

176
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,495
And that was about the role of.

177
00:10:40,495 --> 00:10:40,647
..

178
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:44,887
fundamentally about the role of psychedelics in, in the evolution of human

179
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:45,747
human culture.

180
00:10:45,747 --> 00:10:50,147
And I didn't think that I would go back to the lost civilization issue.

181
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:54,847
But Gobekli Tepe in Turkey kept on forcing itself upon me

182
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,272
the more and more discoveries there, the 11

183
00:10:57,272 --> 00:11:02,047
600-year date from Enclosure D which has the two largest megalithic pillars.

184
00:11:02,047 --> 00:11:03,607
And I, I reached a point where I

185
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:05,567
I realized I have to get back in

186
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:09,047
I have to get back in the water and I have to investigate this again.

187
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:15,487
And, and Gobekli Tepe was a game changer but I think it's a game changer for everything because Gobekli Tepe

188
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:23,091
the, uh, extraordinary nature of it, we're looking at a major megalithic site which is at least 5

189
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:27,947
500 years older than, say, Ġgantija in Malta which is

190
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:32,127
was previously considered to be the oldest megalithic site in the world.

191
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:37,347
And, uh, this led of course to a huge amount of interest and attention both from

192
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:39,947
uh, the Turkish government who see the potential

193
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:43,407
tourism potential of, of having the world's oldest megalithic site

194
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:44,567
and, and from archeologists.

195
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:49,847
And this in turn has led to exploration and excavation throughout the region.

196
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:53,387
And what they're finding throughout that whole region around Gobekli Tepe

197
00:11:53,387 --> 00:12:00,287
uh, and going down into Syria and further down into the Jordan Valley as far as Jericho

198
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:04,847
uh, and even across a bit of the Mediterranean into Cyprus

199
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:10,067
uh, is what Turkish archeologists are now calling the Taš Tepeler civilization

200
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:13,847
they're calling it a civilization, the Stone Hills civilization.

201
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:15,989
Uh, with, uh-.

202
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:16,331
..

203
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:21,192
very definite identifying characteristics: semi-subterranean, circular structures

204
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,811
the use of T-shaped, uh, megalithic pillars

205
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:27,131
sometimes not anywhere near as big as those at Gobekli Tepe.

206
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:31,171
It's clear that Gobekli Tepe now was not the beginning of this process.

207
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:33,332
It was actually, in a way, the end of this process.

208
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:37,852
It was, uh, the summation of everything that that Stone Hills civilization had

209
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:39,172
had achieved.

210
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:45,371
Uh, but what, what is becoming clear is that this is a period between- before the foundation of Gobekli Tepe

211
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,351
as far as we know, that date of 11

212
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,791
600 years ago is the oldest date for Gobekli Tepe.

213
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:54,292
But of course, there's a lot of Gobekli Tepe still underground

214
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:57,592
so we w- we can't say for sure that that's the oldest

215
00:12:57,592 --> 00:12:59,672
but it's the oldest so far, uh

216
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:00,592
excavated.

217
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:05,672
What we're, what we're seeing, uh, is that in that whole region around there

218
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:11,851
there was- something was in motion, and it began to go into motion round about the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

219
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:15,251
And, and this is where these two dates are really important.

220
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,011
The Younger Dryas, I'll round the figures off

221
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:23,771
begins around 12,800 years ago and it ends around 11

222
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,811
600 years ago.

223
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:28,241
So Gobekli Tepe's construction date, if it is 11

224
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,751
600 years ago, if they don't find older materials

225
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,591
marks the end of the Younger Dryas.

226
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:35,691
Um, but the beginning of the Younger Dryas

227
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:41,291
we're already seeing the stirrings of the kind of culture that manifests in full form

228
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,051
uh, at Gobekli Tepe.

229
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:46,911
Uh, and, and after the construction of Gobekli Tepe

230
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:49,651
in fact even during the construction of Gobekli Tepe

231
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:53,031
uh, we see agriculture beginning to be adopted.

232
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:59,371
The, the people who created Gobekli Tepe were all hunter-foragers at the beginning.

233
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,451
But by the time Gobekli Tepe was finished

234
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:07,091
and it was definitely deliberately finished, closed off

235
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:10,951
closed down, deliberately buried, covered with earth

236
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:14,611
covered with rubble, uh, and then topped off with a hill

237
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,371
which is, which is why Gobekli Tepe is called

238
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:18,351
um, what it is.

239
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:21,931
Gobekli Tepe means potbellied hill or the hill of the navel.

240
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:28,811
For a long time, Gobekli Tepe was thought to be just a hill that looked a bit like a pot belly.

241
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:30,631
Can you say how i- it was discovered?

242
00:14:30,631 --> 00:14:32,671
I think, I think this is one of the most fascinating- Well- .

243
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:32,671
..

244
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,671
things on earth, period.

245
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:35,671
So maybe can you say what it is?

246
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:35,911
Yeah.

247
00:14:35,911 --> 00:14:37,031
And how it was discovered?

248
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:40,411
 Well, Go- Gobekli Tepe is, uh

249
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:47,291
first of all the, the oldest fully elaborated megalithic site that we know of anywhere in the world.

250
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,391
It doesn't mean the older ones won't be found

251
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:51,891
but it is the oldest so far found.

252
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,091
Um, the part of the site that's been excavated

253
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:56,851
which is a tiny percentage of the whole site

254
00:14:56,851 --> 00:15:00,431
we do know, my first visit to Gobekli Tepe was in 2013

255
00:15:00,431 --> 00:15:01,191
and Dr.

256
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,591
Klaus Schmidt, the late Dr.

257
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:05,271
Klaus Schmidt, who was, wh- who, who died a year later

258
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:10,011
uh, was very generous to me and showed me around the site f- over a period of three days.

259
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:18,511
And he, he explained to me that they've already used ground penetrating radar on the site and they know that there's much more Gobekli Tepe still underground.

260
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:22,691
Um, so anything is, anything is possible in terms of the

261
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,451
in terms of the dating of Gobekli Tepe.

262
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:30,491
But what we have at the moment is a series of almost circular but not quite circular enclosures

263
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:34,211
which are, which are walled with relatively small stones

264
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:37,891
and then inside them you have pairs of megalithic pillars.

265
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:43,191
And the, the archetypal part of that site is Enclosure D

266
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:46,471
uh, which contains the two largest upright megaliths

267
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:51,491
about 18 feet tall and reckoned to weigh somewhere in the range of 20 tons

268
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,751
uh, if I have my, my memory correct.

269
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:56,151
They're, they're substantial, hefty pieces of stone.

270
00:15:56,151 --> 00:16:02,471
It isn't, it isn't some kind of extraordinary feat to create a 20-foot tall or 20-ton megalith

271
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:04,971
uh, nor is it an extraordinary feat to move it.

272
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:07,491
Uh, there's nothing, there's nothing magical or

273
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:09,531
or really weird about that.

274
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,111
Human beings can do that, and always have.

275
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:16,011
Besides, the quarry for the megaliths is right there.

276
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:18,711
It's within 200 meters of the, of

277
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,331
of the main enclosure, so that's not a mystery.

278
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:23,991
But the mystery is, the mystery is why suddenly this

279
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,471
this new form of architecture, this massive

280
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:29,951
massive, um, megalithic pillars appear.

281
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,071
And the, the pillars, one, one of the things that interests me about the pillars i- is their alignment

282
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:39,651
and there is good work that's been done which suggests that Enclosure D

283
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:42,811
uh, aligns to the rising of the star Sirius.

284
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:47,051
And the rising points of the star Sirius appear to be mapped by the other enclosures

285
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:51,391
which are all oriented in slightly different directions.

286
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:55,911
It was the work entirely of hunter f- foragers

287
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:59,111
but by the time Gobekli Tepe was completed

288
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:02,871
uh, agriculture was being introduced, and, and was

289
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,271
was, was taking place there.

290
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:06,651
Now you asked how Gobekli Tepe was found.

291
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:14,271
The answer to that is that there was a survey of that potbellied hill in the 1960s by

292
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:17,891
um, some American archaeologists, and they were looking

293
00:17:17,891 --> 00:17:23,271
absolutely looking for Stone Age material, for material from the Paleolithic.

294
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:26,310
Um, and they had found some Paleolithic flints

295
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,191
upper Paleolithic flints around there, so it looked like a good place to look.

296
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:32,311
But then they noticed, sticking out of the side of the hill

297
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:37,151
some very finely cut, uh, stone, bits of very large and

298
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:38,371
and very finely cut stone.

299
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:46,291
And looking at that, the workmanship was so good that those archaeologists were confident that it had nothing to do with the Stone Age

300
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:49,311
and they thought they were looking at perhaps some Byzantine

301
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,411
uh, r- remains, and they abandoned the site and

302
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:53,611
and never looked at it further.

303
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:58,431
And it wasn't until the German Archaeological Institute got involved and p- particularly Klaus Schmidt

304
00:17:58,431 --> 00:18:01,451
who I think was a genius, had real insight into this

305
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:04,531
uh, and, and started to dig at Gobekli Tepe

306
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:07,431
that they realized what they'd found, that they'd

307
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:10,431
that they'd found potentially the oldest megalithic site in the world.

308
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:13,911
Uh, and they'd found it at a place where agriculture

309
00:18:13,911 --> 00:18:16,344
according to the established historical tr-.

310
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:16,411
..

311
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,011
timeline.

312
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:21,511
That's where agriculture, at any rate in-in Europe and Western Asia begins.

313
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:27,352
It begins in Anatolia, in Turkey and then it gradually disseminates westward from there.

314
00:18:27,352 --> 00:18:31,871
And yet the understanding is, it was created by hunter-gatherers.

315
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:33,951
It was created by hunter-gatherers, yeah.

316
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:36,721
They were- there- there was no agriculture 11

317
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,812
600 years ago in Gobekli Tepe.

318
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:42,451
But by the time Gobekli Tepe was decommissioned

319
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:45,011
and I use that word deliberately, was closed down

320
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:48,732
uh, and- and buried, uh, agriculture was all around it.

321
00:18:48,732 --> 00:18:54,511
Uh, and- and- and this was agriculture of people who knew how to cultivate- cultivate plants.

322
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:59,051
Do we have an understanding when it was turned into a

323
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,631
if I could say, a time capsule?

324
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:03,412
So protected by forming a mound around it?

325
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:03,591
Yes.

326
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:05,391
It- it- Is it around that similar time?

327
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:10,601
It stood from roughly 11,600 years ago to about 10

328
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:13,751
400 years ago, to about 8400 BC.

329
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:20,131
So, around 1200 years it was there and it continued to be elaborated as a site.

330
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:22,351
And while it was being elaborated as a site

331
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:23,799
we see agriculture.

332
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:23,931
..

333
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:26,871
I'm gonna use the word being introduced.

334
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:30,531
Uh, it had n- there'd been no sign of it before and suddenly it's there

335
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:33,331
and to me that's another of the mysteries about Gobekli Tepe.

336
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:35,871
And then with the new work that- that's being done

337
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:38,331
we realized that it's part of a much wider phenomenon

338
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:41,671
uh, which spreads across an enormous distance.

339
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:46,691
Um, and- and, um, the puzzling thing is that after Gobekli Tepe

340
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:48,331
there almost seems to be a decline.

341
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:53,551
Things- things fall down again, and- and then we enter this long slow process of the Neolithic

342
00:19:53,551 --> 00:20:02,131
thousands of years, uh, gradual developments until we come to ancient Sumer and- and- and Mesopotamia.

343
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:06,291
But agriculture has taken a firm- a firm root by then.

344
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:08,671
Actually one other thing, I'll just say this in passing.

345
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:13,471
Uh, when- when I talk about a lost civilization introducing ideas to people

346
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:18,411
I'm often accused of stealing credit from the indigenous people who had those ideas in the first place.

347
00:20:18,411 --> 00:20:28,571
So I do find it slightly hypocritical that archeology is- fully accepts that the idea of agriculture was introduced to Western Europe from Turkey.

348
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:32,651
Uh, and that- that- that Western Europeans didn't invent agriculture

349
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:36,971
it was absolutely introduced by Anatolian farmers who- who- who traveled west.

350
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:41,091
So the no- the notion of dissemination of ideas perhaps shouldn't be so

351
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:43,391
um, annoying to archeologists as it is.

352
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:49,851
And perhaps we should also state, if we look at the entirety of history of hominids

353
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:53,831
humans or hominids have been explorers.

354
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,711
I- I didn't even know this.

355
00:20:55,711 --> 00:20:57,211
When I was preparing for this- Yeah.

356
00:20:57,211 --> 00:20:57,271
.

357
00:20:57,271 --> 00:20:57,391
..

358
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,031
looking at Homo erectus- Yeah.

359
00:20:59,031 --> 00:20:59,097
.

360
00:20:59,097 --> 00:20:59,231
..

361
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:00,137
1.

362
00:21:00,137 --> 00:21:01,891
9 million years ago- Absolutely.

363
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:01,897
.

364
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:01,911
..

365
00:21:01,911 --> 00:21:05,071
almost right away they spread out through the whole world.

366
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:05,291
Yeah.

367
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:14,091
And we Homo sapiens evolved from them, and we should also mention since we're talking about a sort of controversial debates going on

368
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:18,771
as I understand there's still debates about the dynamics of all that was going on there

369
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,211
like we mentioned in Africa- Mm.

370
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:20,257
.

371
00:21:20,257 --> 00:21:20,351
..

372
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:26,971
that it's th- you know, I think the current understanding we didn't come from one particular point of Africa

373
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:28,511
that there's multiple locations.

374
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:28,731
Mm-hmm.

375
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,911
This is the Out of Africa theory.

376
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:30,951
Yes.

377
00:21:30,951 --> 00:21:33,991
I think it's more than a theory, it's- it's really strongly evidenced.

378
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:34,571
Why?

379
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:37,451
Because we're part of the great ape family and it's- and it's

380
00:21:37,451 --> 00:21:38,951
uh, a- an African family.

381
00:21:38,951 --> 00:21:39,431
Yeah.

382
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,391
Uh, there's no doubt that- that human beings

383
00:21:41,391 --> 00:21:43,611
our deep origins are in Africa.

384
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:45,191
But then there, as you rightly say

385
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:49,691
there were these very early migrations out of Africa

386
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:55,111
uh, by species that are likely ancestral to anatomically modern humans

387
00:21:55,111 --> 00:22:01,371
including definitely Homo erectus and- and- and the astonishingly distant travels that they undertook.

388
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:06,251
Yes, I think- I think there is an urge to explore in- in- in all of humanity.

389
00:22:06,251 --> 00:22:09,211
I think there is an urge to find out what's around the next corner

390
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:12,171
what's over the brow of the- of the next hill.

391
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:15,751
Uh, and I think that goes very deep into human character

392
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:23,431
and I think it was being manifested in those- those early adventures of people who left Africa and traveled all around the world.

393
00:22:23,431 --> 00:22:25,951
And then settling in different parts of the world

394
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:31,471
uh, I- I think a lot of- a lot of anatomically modern human evolution took place outside Africa as well

395
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:32,811
not- not only in Africa.

396
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:43,851
So I guess th- the general puzzlement that you're filled with is given that these creatures explore and spread and

397
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:51,831
uh, try out different environments, why did it take hundreds of thousands of years for them to develop complicated society settlements?

398
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:51,891
Yes.

399
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:52,991
That's the first big question.

400
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,051
Why did it take so long?

401
00:22:54,051 --> 00:22:56,831
And that raises in my mind a hypothesis

402
00:22:56,831 --> 00:22:57,811
a possibility.

403
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,731
Maybe it didn't take so long.

404
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:07,351
Maybe- maybe things were happening that we haven't yet got hold of in the archeological record which- which await to be discovered.

405
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:13,771
Um, and of course there are huge parts of the world that have not been studied at all by archeology.

406
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:24,071
But the fact that- the fact that huge parts of the world have not been studied at all by archeology is not in its- on its own enough to suggest that we're missing a chapter in the human story.

407
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:29,168
Uh, the reason that I come to that isn't only puzzlement about that 300

408
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:30,231
000 year gap.

409
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:34,951
It's also to do with the fact that there's common iconography

410
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:43,071
there's common myths and traditions, and there's common spiritual ideas that are found all around the world.

411
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:50,171
Um, and- and, uh, they're found amongst cultures that are geographically distant from one another

412
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:53,191
uh, and that are also distant from one another in time.

413
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:56,131
They don't necessarily occur at the same time.

414
00:23:56,131 --> 00:24:03,271
And this is where I think that archeology is perhaps desperately needing a history of ideas as well as just a history of things.

415
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:09,431
Uh, because an idea, um, can- can manifest again and again

416
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:11,151
uh, throughout the human story.

417
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,591
So that- so there are particular- there are particular issues

418
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:18,691
uh, for example the notion of the afterlife destiny of the soul.

419
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,211
Uh, what happens to us when we die.

420
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,491
Um, and believe me when you reach my age

421
00:24:24,491 --> 00:24:27,071
that's something you do- you do think  about

422
00:24:27,071 --> 00:24:28,251
what- what- what happens.

423
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:30,311
I used to feel immortal when I was in my 40s

424
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:34,411
but now that I'm 74, I definitely know that I'm- th- th- that I'm not.

425
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:38,571
Well, it would be natural for human beings all around the world to have that same- that same feeling

426
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:39,471
that same idea.

427
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:41,594
But why would they all.

428
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:41,845
..

429
00:24:41,845 --> 00:24:42,097
..

430
00:24:42,097 --> 00:24:47,064
. decide that what happens to the soul after death is that it makes a leap to the heavens

431
00:24:47,064 --> 00:24:50,503
to the Milky Way, that it makes a journey along the Milky Way

432
00:24:50,503 --> 00:24:53,624
that there it is confronted by challenges, by monsters

433
00:24:53,624 --> 00:24:54,643
by closed gates.

434
00:24:54,643 --> 00:25:01,683
The course of the life that that person has lived will determine their destiny in that afterlife journey.

435
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:03,823
And this idea, the, the path of souls

436
00:25:03,823 --> 00:25:05,463
the Milky Way is called the path of souls

437
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:08,723
it's very strongly found in the Americas, right?

438
00:25:08,723 --> 00:25:11,583
From South America through Mexico, through into North America

439
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:14,443
but it's also found, uh, in ancient Egypt

440
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:17,584
uh, in ancient India, in ancient Mesopotamia

441
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,223
the same, the same idea.

442
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:22,143
Uh, and I don't feel that that can be a coincidence.

443
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:26,383
I feel, I feel that what we're looking at is an inheritance of an idea

444
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:32,983
a legacy that's been passed down from a remote common source to cultures all around the world.

445
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:36,143
And th- and then has taken on a life of its own within those cultures.

446
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:40,563
So the remote common source would explain both the similarities and the differences

447
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:43,323
uh, in the expression of these ideas.

448
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:46,703
The other thing, very puzzling thing, is

449
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:54,423
um, the sequence of numbers that are a result of the precession of the equinoxes

450
00:25:54,423 --> 00:25:56,723
at least I think that's the best theory to explain them.

451
00:25:56,723 --> 00:26:07,323
Um, here I think it's important to pay tribute to the work of Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Deschend.

452
00:26:07,323 --> 00:26:12,183
Giorgio, Giorgio de Santillana was professor of history of science actually at MIT

453
00:26:12,183 --> 00:26:14,383
where, wh- where you're based, back in the '60s.

454
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:19,203
Um, and Hertha von Deschend was professor of the history of science at Frankfurt University.

455
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:24,683
And they wrote, uh, an immense book in the 1960s called Hamlet's Mill.

456
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:28,223
Uh, and, and Hamlet's Mill, uh

457
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:35,743
differs very strongly from established opinion on the issue of the phenomenon of precession

458
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:37,943
and I'll explain what precession is in a moment.

459
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:44,903
Um, generally, it's held that it was the Greeks who discovered the precession

460
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:48,523
uh, and the dating on that is put back not very far

461
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,323
maybe 2,300 years ago or so.

462
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:55,583
Santillana and von Deschend are pointing out that knowledge of precession is much

463
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:58,243
much older than that, thousands of years older than that

464
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,223
and, and they do actually trace it

465
00:27:00,223 --> 00:27:02,543
I think I'm quoting them pretty much correctly

466
00:27:02,543 --> 00:27:06,283
to some almost unbelievable ancestor civilization.

467
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:10,423
Reading that book was one of the several reasons that I got into this

468
00:27:10,423 --> 00:27:12,183
this mystery in the first place.

469
00:27:12,183 --> 00:27:15,823
Okay, now, the precession of the equinoxes

470
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:17,663
to give it its full name, is

471
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:25,243
is, uh, results from the fact that our planet is the viewing platform from which we observe the stars.

472
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,459
Uh, and our planet, of course, is rotating on its own axis at roughly 1

473
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:31,903
000 miles an hour at the equator, uh

474
00:27:31,903 --> 00:27:35,123
but what's less obvious is that it's also wobbling on its axis.

475
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:40,703
And that i- so if you imagine the extended north pole of the Earth pointing up at the sky

476
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:43,823
in our time, it's pointing at the star Polaris

477
00:27:43,823 --> 00:27:45,603
and that is our pole star.

478
00:27:45,603 --> 00:27:48,423
But Polaris has not always been the pole star

479
00:27:48,423 --> 00:27:51,843
precisely because of this wobble on the axis of the Earth.

480
00:27:51,843 --> 00:27:55,183
Uh, other stars have occupied the pole position

481
00:27:55,183 --> 00:27:58,563
and sometimes the extended north pole of the Earth points at empty space.

482
00:27:58,563 --> 00:28:00,263
There is no pole star.

483
00:28:00,263 --> 00:28:03,723
That's one of the obvious results of the wobble on the Earth's axis.

484
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:08,663
The other one is that there are 12 well-known constellations in our time

485
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:13,203
the 12 constellations of the zodiac, that lie along what is referred to as the

486
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,663
the path of the sun.

487
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:16,963
The Earth is orbiting the sun, uh

488
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:20,243
and we are seeing what's behind it, what's

489
00:28:20,243 --> 00:28:22,743
what's in direct line with the sun in our

490
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:23,543
in our view.

491
00:28:23,543 --> 00:28:27,703
And the zodiacal constellations all lie along the path of the sun

492
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:33,243
so at different times of the year, the sun will rise against the background of a particular zodiacal constellation.

493
00:28:33,243 --> 00:28:36,343
Uh, today we live in the age of Pisces

494
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:41,703
uh, and it's n- definitely not an accident that the early Christians used the fish

495
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:43,183
uh, as their symbol.

496
00:28:43,183 --> 00:28:46,083
Uh, this is another area where I differ from archaeology.

497
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:52,543
I think, I think the constellations of the zodiac were reco- recognized as such much earlier than we suppose.

498
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:54,463
Anyway, to get to the point, uh

499
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:58,103
the key marker of the year, certainly in the Northern Hemisphere

500
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,643
was the spring equinox.

501
00:28:59,643 --> 00:29:05,703
Uh, this was, the question was, what constellation is rising behind the sun?

502
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:10,123
What's c- what constellation is housing the sun at dawn on the spring equinox?

503
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,163
Uh, right now it's Pisces.

504
00:29:12,163 --> 00:29:15,323
In another 150 years or so, it'll be Aquarius.

505
00:29:15,323 --> 00:29:17,963
We, we do live in the dawning of the age of Aquarius.

506
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:21,043
Uh, back in the time of, um

507
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:24,603
the late ancient Egyptians, it was Aries

508
00:29:24,603 --> 00:29:26,963
going back to the time of Ramesses or before.

509
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:28,723
Before that, it was Taurus.

510
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:30,003
And so on and so forth.

511
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:34,033
It's backwards through the zodiac, uh, until 12

512
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:40,483
500 years ago, you come to the age of Leo when the constellation of Leo houses the sun on the spring equinox.

513
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:43,623
Now this process unfolds very, very, very

514
00:29:43,623 --> 00:29:44,643
very slowly.

515
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:47,443
It un- the whole cycle, and it is a cycle

516
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:50,923
it repeats itself roughly every 26,000 years.

517
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,103
Put a r- put a more exact figure on it

518
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:55,463
25,920 years.

519
00:29:55,463 --> 00:29:57,523
Uh, that may be a convention.

520
00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:59,803
Some scholars would s- would say it was a bit less than that

521
00:29:59,803 --> 00:30:01,203
a bit more, but you're talking fractions.

522
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:04,783
It's, it's in that area, 25,920 years.

523
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:07,663
Um, and, and, uh, to observe it

524
00:30:07,663 --> 00:30:10,743
you really need more than one human lifetime

525
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:16,423
because it unfolds very, very slowly, at a rate of one degree every 72 years.

526
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:20,483
And the parallel that I often give is hold your finger up to the horizon

527
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:21,503
the distant horizon.

528
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:25,563
The movement in one lifetime, in, in the period of 72 years

529
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:27,103
is about the width of your finger.

530
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:30,183
Uh, it's not impossible to notice in a lifetime

531
00:30:30,183 --> 00:30:31,343
but it's, but it's difficult.

532
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:32,283
You gotta pass it on.

533
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:36,923
Um, and, and what seems to have happened is that some ancient culture

534
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:41,463
the culture that Santillana and von Deschend call some almost unbelievable ancestor culture

535
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:46,404
worked out the entire process of precession and.

536
00:30:46,404 --> 00:30:46,735
..

537
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:47,065
..

538
00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:49,751
. selected the key numbers of precession, of which

539
00:30:49,751 --> 00:30:52,151
of which the most important number, the governing number

540
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,451
is the number 72.

541
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,112
Uh, but, but we also have, uh

542
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:58,711
numbers related to the number 72.

543
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:05,252
72 plus 36 is 108, 108 divided by two is 54.

544
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:10,751
Uh, these, these numbers are also found in mythology all around the world.

545
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:14,931
There were 72 conspirators, uh, who, um

546
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:17,811
were involved in killing the god Osiris in

547
00:31:17,811 --> 00:31:21,831
in ancient Egypt and nailing him up in a wooden coffer and dumping him in the

548
00:31:21,831 --> 00:31:23,051
in the Nile.

549
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:28,412
Um, there are 432,000 in the Rig Veda.

550
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:32,451
432,000 is a multiple of 72, uh

551
00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:36,151
and, and, um, at Angkor in Cambodia

552
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:39,991
for example, you have, uh, the bridge to Angkor Thom

553
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:44,092
and on that bridge you have figures on both sides

554
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:49,511
f- sculpted figures, which are holding the body of a serpent.

555
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:55,271
Uh, that serpent is Vasuki, and what they're doing is they're churning the milky ocean.

556
00:31:55,271 --> 00:32:00,511
It's the same metaphor of churning and turning that's defined in the story of Hamlet's mill

557
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:01,651
of Umlotti's Mill.

558
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:04,111
Uh, there are 54 on each side.

559
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:09,491
54 plus 54 is 108, 108 is 72 plus 36.

560
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:13,571
It's a precessional number according to the work that Santillana and von Deschen did.

561
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:19,171
And the fascination with these, this number system and its discovery all around the world

562
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,691
uh, is one of the puzzles that

563
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:35,791
that intrigue me and, and, uh, suggest to me that we are looking at ancestral knowledge that was passed down and probably was passed down from a specific single common source at one time but then was spread out very

564
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:37,131
very widely around the world.

565
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:55,051
So one of the defining ways that you approach the study of human history that I think contrasts with mainstream archeology is that you take this sort of astronomical symbolism and the relationship between humans and the stars very seriously.

566
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:55,551
I do.

567
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:57,191
Uh, as I believe the ancients did.

568
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:59,051
I think it's important to sort of, uh

569
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:03,811
consider what humans would have thought about back then.

570
00:33:03,811 --> 00:33:06,171
Now we have a lot of distractions.

571
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,571
We have social media, we can watch videos on YouTube and whatever.

572
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,011
Mm-hmm.

573
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:14,371
But back then, especially before sort of electricity- Mm.

574
00:33:14,371 --> 00:33:14,437
.

575
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:14,571
..

576
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:17,191
the stars is like - Yeah.

577
00:33:17,191 --> 00:33:17,204
.

578
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:17,231
..

579
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:18,591
the sexiest thing to talk about.

580
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:19,731
There's no light pollution.

581
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,771
There's no light pollution so there's th- that's

582
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:23,491
and you're spending s- That's the majesty of the heavens.

583
00:33:23,491 --> 00:33:26,771
Every single night you're spending looking up at the stars

584
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:33,331
and you can imagine there's a lot of sort of status value to be the guy who's very good at studying the stars- Yeah.

585
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:33,791
Yeah.

586
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:33,797
.

587
00:33:33,797 --> 00:33:33,811
..

588
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:35,711
and sort of the scientists of the day- Yeah.

589
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:35,717
.

590
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:35,731
..

591
00:33:35,731 --> 00:33:39,031
and I'm sure there's going to be these geniuses that emerge- Yeah.

592
00:33:39,031 --> 00:33:39,104
.

593
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:39,251
..

594
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,631
that are able to, uh, do two things.

595
00:33:41,631 --> 00:33:45,491
One, tell stories about the gods or whatever- Mm.

596
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:45,504
.

597
00:33:45,504 --> 00:33:45,531
..

598
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:48,731
based on the stars, and then also as we'll probably talk about

599
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:52,191
use the stars practically for navigation, for example.

600
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:52,491
Oh yeah.

601
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:53,251
Definitely.

602
00:33:53,251 --> 00:34:02,831
And s- and so like, it makes sense that the stars had a primal importance for the ideas of the times

603
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:07,168
for the status, the, for religious explorations.

604
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:07,291
..

605
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:08,871
It was an ever-present reality.

606
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:09,210
Yes.

607
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,471
And it was bright and it was brilliant- Yeah.

608
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:11,476
.

609
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:11,491
..

610
00:34:11,491 --> 00:34:13,150
uh, and it was full of lights.

611
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:17,811
Uh, it, it, it, it's inconceivable that the ancients would not have paid attention to it.

612
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:19,670
It was, it was an overwhelming presence

613
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,891
and that's one of the reasons why I'm really confident that the

614
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:28,130
the constellations that we now recognize as the constellations of the zodiac were recognized much earlier

615
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:38,391
because it's hard to miss when you pay attention to the sky that the sun over the course of the solar year is month by month rising against the background of different constellations.

616
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:41,891
And then there's a much longer process, the process of precession

617
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:46,507
which takes that journey backwards and where we have a period of 2

618
00:34:46,507 --> 00:34:49,331
160 years for each sign of the zodiac.

619
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:51,471
I think it would have been hard for the ancients to have missed that.

620
00:34:51,471 --> 00:34:56,210
They might not have identified the constellations in exactly the same way we do today

621
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,391
that may well be a Babylonian or Greek

622
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:02,031
uh, convention, but that the constellations were there

623
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:07,311
uh, I think was very clear, and that they were special constellations unlike other ones higher up in the sky

624
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:10,111
uh, which were not on the path of the sun that

625
00:35:10,111 --> 00:35:11,471
that people paid attention to.

626
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:18,031
Well, but detecting the precession of the equinox is hard because especially they don't have any writing systems

627
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:22,371
they don't have any mathematical systems, so everything is told through words.

628
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:22,851
Yeah.

629
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:23,851
They, well, they, and they have

630
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:26,071
uh, let's not underestimate oral traditions.

631
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:30,911
Uh, the, th- or- oral traditions, that's something we've lost in our culture today.

632
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:33,591
It's one of the things that happens with the written word

633
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:36,451
uh, is that you gradually lose your memory.

634
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:39,511
Um, actually there's a nice story from

635
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:43,011
from ancient Egypt about the god Thoth, the god of wisdom

636
00:35:43,011 --> 00:35:48,091
who is very proud of himself because he has invented writing.

637
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:52,631
"Look at this gift," he says to a mythical pharaoh of that time

638
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:54,971
"Look at the gift that I am giving humanity.

639
00:35:54,971 --> 00:35:55,711
Writing.

640
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:57,171
This is a wonderful thing.

641
00:35:57,171 --> 00:36:01,361
It'll enable you to preserve so much that you would otherwise lose.

642
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:05,331
" And, and, um, the pharaoh in this story replies to him

643
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:05,691
"No.

644
00:36:05,691 --> 00:36:08,011
You have not given us a wonderful gift.

645
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:09,891
You have destroyed the art of memory.

646
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:12,231
Uh, we will forget everything.

647
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:18,933
Words will roam free around the world not accompanied by any wise advice to set them into context.

648
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:20,271
" And actually that's a, that's, that's a

649
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:27,591
that's a very interesting point and, and we do know that cultures that still do have oral traditions are able to preserve information for very long periods of time.

650
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:30,131
One thing I, I think is clear in

651
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:33,891
in any time, in any period of history is human beings love stories.

652
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,171
Yeah.

653
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:36,011
We, we, we love great stories and

654
00:36:36,011 --> 00:36:38,571
and one way to preserve information, uh

655
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,771
is to encode it, embed it in a great story.

656
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:43,516
Uh, and, and.

657
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:43,789
..

658
00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:44,062
..

659
00:36:44,062 --> 00:36:50,599
. so carefully done that, that actually it doesn't matter whether the storyteller knows that they're passing on that information or not.

660
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:53,179
Uh, the story itself is the vehicle

661
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,639
uh, and as long as it's repeated faithfully

662
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,840
the information contained within it will be, will be passed on.

663
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,199
And I, I do think this is

664
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,339
this is part of the, the story of the preve- preservation of knowledge.

665
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:06,519
So that's one of the reasons that you take myths seriously?

666
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,839
I take them very seriously, and, and the other

667
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:24,059
hmm, many reasons, but, but I can't help being deeply impressed and deeply puzzled by the worldwide tradition of a global cataclysm within human memory.

668
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:28,319
I mean, we know that, we know scientifically that there have been many

669
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:31,359
many cataclysms in the past going back millions of years.

670
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,820
I mean, the best-known one, of course

671
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,700
is the K-Pg event, as it's now called

672
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,939
that made the dinosaurs extinct 65 million or

673
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:42,059
or, or 66 million years ago.

674
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:47,439
But has there been such a cataclysm in the lifetime of the human species?

675
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,739
Um, yeah, the Mount Toba eruption about 70

676
00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:55,639
000 years ago was pretty bad, uh, but a global cataclysm

677
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:59,159
the Younger Dryas really ticks all the boxes as a

678
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:04,059
as a, as a worldwide disaster, which definitely involved sea level rise

679
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:07,899
both at the beginning and at the end of the Younger Dryas.

680
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:12,040
It definitely involved the swallowing up of lands that previously had been above water

681
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
uh, and I think it's a, an excellent candidate

682
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,259
uh, for this worldwide tradition of a global cataclysm of which one of

683
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:23,199
but not the only distinguishing characteristics was a flood

684
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,439
an enormous flood, and the submergence of lands that had previously been above water

685
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:29,699
uh, under water.

686
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:32,759
The fact that this story is found all around the world

687
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:37,600
uh, suggests to me that the archeological explanation is

688
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,540
look, people suffer local floods all the time.

689
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,300
I'm, I mean, as we're talking, there's

690
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,639
there's, there's flooding in Florida, uh, but I

691
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:50,019
I, I don't think anybody in Florida is going to make the mistake of believing that that's a global flood.

692
00:38:50,019 --> 00:38:52,039
They, they know it's, they know it's local

693
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:59,459
um, but that's the argument largely of archeology dealing with the flood myths or that some local population experienced a

694
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:03,659
a nasty local flooding event and they decided to say that it was

695
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:05,119
that it affected the whole world.

696
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,999
I, I'm not persuaded by that, particularly since we know there was a nasty epoch

697
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:20,079
the Younger Dryas, when flooding did occur and when the earth was subjected to events cataclysmic enough to extinguish entirely the megafauna of the Ice Age.

698
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:28,459
So there is the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis that provides an explanation of what happened during this period- Yeah.

699
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:28,465
.

700
00:39:28,465 --> 00:39:28,479
..

701
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:32,779
that resulted in such rapid environmental change, so can you explain this hypothesis?

702
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:36,319
Yes, um, the y- the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

703
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,259
YDIH for short, uh, is, uh

704
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:45,979
is not a lunatic fringe theory as its opponents often attempt to write it off.

705
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:50,099
Um, it's the work of more than 60 major scientists

706
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:54,619
uh, working across many different disciplines, including archeology

707
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:57,739
uh, and, and including oceanography as well.

708
00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:06,719
Um, uh, and, and, uh, they are collectively puzzled by the sudden onset of the Younger Dryas

709
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,449
and by the fact that is, it is accompanied 12

710
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:13,199
800 years ago by a distinct layer in the earth.

711
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,159
Uh, you can see it most clearly at

712
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,659
uh, Murray Springs in Arizona, for example.

713
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:22,499
You can, you can see, it's about the width of a human hand

714
00:40:22,499 --> 00:40:26,859
uh, and there's a, uh, a draw there that's been cut by flash flooding at some time

715
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,659
and that draw has revealed the sides of the draw.

716
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:31,379
And you can, you can see the cross-section

717
00:40:31,379 --> 00:40:35,339
and in the cross-section is this distinct dark layer that runs through the earth

718
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:39,039
and it contains evidence of wildfires, fires.

719
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,919
There's a lot of soot in it.

720
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:43,899
Uh, there are also nanodiamonds in it.

721
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,819
There is shocked quartz in it.

722
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:50,531
There is quartz that's been melted at temperatures in excess of 2

723
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,219
200 degrees centigrade.

724
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:54,799
Um, there are carbon microspherules.

725
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:59,039
All of these are proxies for some kind of cosmic impact.

726
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,399
I talked a moment ago about the extinction of the dinosaurs

727
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:06,159
Louis and Walter Alvarez who, who made that incredible discovery

728
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,799
uh, initially their, their discovery was based entirely on impact proxies

729
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:12,559
just as the Younger Dryas is.

730
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,019
There was no crater, and for a long time they were disbelieved because they couldn't produce a crater.

731
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:21,319
Uh, but when they finally did produce that deeply buried Chicxulub crater

732
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:24,139
that's when people started to say, "Yeah

733
00:41:24,139 --> 00:41:24,964
they have to be right.

734
00:41:24,964 --> 00:41:26,679
" But they weren't relying on the crater.

735
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:35,339
They were relying on the impact proxies, and they're the same impact proxies that we find in what's called the Younger Dryas boundary layer all around the world.

736
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:42,579
Um, so, so it's the fact that at the moment when the earth tips into a radical climate shift

737
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:45,383
it, it, it's been warming up for at least 2

738
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:48,019
000 years before 12,800 years ago.

739
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:51,239
People at the time must have been feeling a great sense of relief

740
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:51,499
you know?

741
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:53,719
"We've been living through this really cold time

742
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,719
but it's getting better.

743
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,819
Things are getting better.

744
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:58,879
" And then suddenly around 12,800 years ago

745
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:05,519
some might say 12,860 years ago, there's a massive global plunge in global temperatures

746
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,339
and, and the world suddenly gets as cold as it was at the peak of the Ice Age

747
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:13,039
and, and it, it's almost literally overnight.

748
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,119
It's very, very, very rapid.

749
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,659
Normally in an epoch when the earth is going into a freeze

750
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:20,719
you would not expect sea levels to rise

751
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:23,259
but there is a sea level rise, a sudden one

752
00:42:23,259 --> 00:42:25,579
right at the beginning of the Younger Dryas

753
00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:29,779
and then you have this long frozen period from 12

754
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:32,259
800 to 11,600 years ago.

755
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:39,959
And then equally dramatically and equally suddenly, the Younger Dryas comes to an end and the world very rapidly warms up

756
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:46,019
and you have a, a recognized pulse of meltwater at that time as the last of the glaciers collapse into the sea

757
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:49,279
uh, called Meltwater Pulse 1B, round about 11

758
00:42:49,279 --> 00:42:50,419
600 years ago.

759
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:52,499
So, so this is, um.

760
00:42:52,499 --> 00:42:52,765
..

761
00:42:52,765 --> 00:42:56,659
This is a period, uh, which is very tightly defined.

762
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,299
Uh, it's a period when we know that human populations were

763
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:01,899
were grievously disturbed.

764
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:07,920
That's when the, the so-called Clovis culture of North America vanished entirely from the record

765
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,359
uh, during the Younger Dryas and it's the time when the mammoths and the saber-toothed tigers vanished from the record as well.

766
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,479
Is there a good understanding of what happened geologically

767
00:43:16,479 --> 00:43:18,199
whether there was an impact or not?

768
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:23,900
Like, what explains this huge dip in temperature and then rise in temperature?

769
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:34,180
The abrupt cessation of the global meridional overturning circulation of which the Gulf Stream is the best known part.

770
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,559
Uh, the main theory that's been put forward up to now

771
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:40,639
and I don't dispute that theory at all

772
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:47,279
is that the sudden freeze was becau- was caused by the cutting off of the Gulf Stream

773
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:51,099
basically, uh, which is part of the central heating system of our planet so no

774
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,959
no wonder it became c- c- cold.

775
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:56,399
But what's not really been addressed before is why that happened

776
00:43:56,399 --> 00:44:02,819
why the Gulf Stream was cut, why a sudden pulse of melt water went into the world ocean and

777
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:07,319
and it was s- so much of it and it was so cold that it actually stopped the Gulf Stream in its tracks.

778
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:12,899
And that's where the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis offers a very elegant and very satisfactory solution

779
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:14,199
uh, to the problem.

780
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:18,599
Now, the hypothesis of course is broader than that.

781
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,979
Uh, amongst the scientists working on it are

782
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:25,459
for example, Bill Napier, an astrophysicist and astronomer.

783
00:44:25,459 --> 00:44:34,759
Um, they have assembled a great deal of evidence which suggests that the culprit in the Younger Dryas impact event

784
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:39,099
or events, was what we now call the torrid meteor stream

785
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:43,099
uh, which the earth still passes through twice a year.

786
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:46,339
It's now about 30 million kilometers wide.

787
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:48,799
Takes the earth a couple of days to

788
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:50,179
to pass through it on its orbit.

789
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:53,859
It passed through it in June and it passes through it at the end of October.

790
00:44:53,859 --> 00:45:05,469
The suggestion is that the torrid meteor stream is the end product of a very large comet that entered the solar system round about 20

791
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,639
000 years ago, came in from the Oort cloud

792
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,819
got trapped by the gravity of the sun

793
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:13,899
and went into orbit around the sun, an orbit that crossed the orbit of the earth.

794
00:45:13,899 --> 00:45:17,099
Um, however, when it was one object

795
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,439
the likelihood of a collision with the earth was extremely small

796
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:24,659
but as it started to do what all comets do

797
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:27,039
which was to break up into multiple fragments

798
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:30,299
'cause these are chunks of rock held together by ice

799
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:35,739
uh, and as they warm up, they split and disintegrate and break into pieces.

800
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:40,659
As it passed through that, its debris stream became larger and larger and wider and wider

801
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:44,339
and the theory is that 12,800 years ago

802
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:51,339
the earth passed through a particularly dense part of the torrid meteor stream and was hit by multiple impacts

803
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:57,699
uh, all around the planet, certainly from the west of North America as far east as Syria.

804
00:45:57,699 --> 00:46:00,499
Uh, and that we are, by and large

805
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:04,139
not talking about impacts that would have- that would have caused craters

806
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,059
although there certainly were some.

807
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:08,479
Uh, we're talking about air bursts.

808
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:16,059
When an object is 100 or 150 meters in diameter and it's coming in very fast

809
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:21,179
uh, into the earth's atmosphere, uh, it is very unlikely to reach the earth.

810
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:28,839
It's gonna blow up in the sky and the best known recent example of that is the Tunguska event in Siberia

811
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:31,339
which took place on the 30th of June

812
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:32,539
1908.

813
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:39,059
The Tunguska event was- nobody disputes, it was definitely an air burst of- of- of a cometary fragment.

814
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:45,219
And the date is interesting, uh, because the 30th of June is the height of the beta toroids.

815
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,119
It's one of the two times when the earth is going through the toroid meteor stream.

816
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,399
Well, luckily, that part of Siberia wasn't inhabited

817
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:54,699
uh, but 2,000 square miles of forest were destroyed.

818
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:56,599
If that had happened over a major city

819
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:03,119
we would all be thinking very hard about objects out of the toroid meteor stream and about the risk of

820
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,719
uh, cosmic impact.

821
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:07,639
So the suggestion is that it wasn't one impact

822
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:09,439
it wasn't two impacts, it wasn't three impacts

823
00:47:09,439 --> 00:47:19,879
it was- it was hundreds of air bursts all around the planet coupled with- coupled with a number of bigger objects which the scientists working on this think hit the North American ice cap

824
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:20,599
largely.

825
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:23,479
Some of them may also have hit the northern European ice cap

826
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:29,499
resulting in that sudden, otherwise unexplained flood of melt water that went into the world ocean

827
00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:34,619
um, and- and, uh, caused the cooling that then- that then took place.

828
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:49,599
But this was a disaster for life all over the planet and- and it's interesting that one of the sites where they find the Younger Dryas boundary and where they find overwhelming evidence of an air burst and where they find all the shocked quartz

829
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,099
the carbon microspherules, the nanodiamonds, the trinitite and so on and so forth.

830
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:59,119
All, um, o- of- of those impact proxies are found at Abu Hureyra.

831
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,509
That was, uh, a settlement within 150 miles of Gobekli Tepe and it was hit 12

832
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,299
800 years ago and it was obliterated.

833
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:12,379
Interestingly, it was reinhabited by human beings within probably five years

834
00:48:12,379 --> 00:48:15,799
but it was- it was completely obliterated at that time.

835
00:48:15,799 --> 00:48:22,279
Uh, and it- it- it's difficult to imagine that the people who lived in that area would not have been very impressed

836
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:27,559
uh, by what they saw happening, by the- the- these massive explosions in the sky and the

837
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:30,759
uh, the obliteration, uh, of- of Abu Hureyra.

838
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:34,119
Now, this is a theory, the Younger Dryas impact

839
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,439
it's a hypothesis actually, it's not even a theory.

840
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:39,259
A theory is, I think, considered a higher level than a hypothesis.

841
00:48:39,259 --> 00:48:41,939
That's why it's the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis

842
00:48:41,939 --> 00:48:45,739
and of course, it has many opponents and there are many who disagree with it

843
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:49,836
uh, and there- there- there have been a series of- of-.

844
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:50,115
..

845
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:55,835
peer-reviewed papers that have been published supposedly debunking the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.

846
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:57,715
One, I think, was in 2011.

847
00:48:57,715 --> 00:49:02,066
It was called a, a "Requiem for the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.

848
00:49:02,066 --> 00:49:05,916
" And there's one just been published a few months ago or a year ago c- you know

849
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:10,455
called a, A Complete, uh, Refutation of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

850
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:12,635
something, something like that, some lengthy title.

851
00:49:12,635 --> 00:49:18,536
Um, the, so, so it's, it's a hypothesis that has its opponents and even within

852
00:49:18,536 --> 00:49:21,876
within those of us who are looking at the alternative side of history

853
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,636
there are different points of view.

854
00:49:23,636 --> 00:49:34,755
Uh, Robert Schoch from Boston University, the geologist who demonstrated that the erosion on the Sphinx may well have been caused by exposure to a long period of very heavy rainfall

855
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:38,356
uh, he doesn't go for the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis.

856
00:49:38,356 --> 00:49:43,075
He think, he, he fully accepts that the Younger Dryas was a global cataclysm

857
00:49:43,075 --> 00:49:45,495
uh, and that the extinctions took place

858
00:49:45,495 --> 00:49:49,455
but he thinks it was caused by some kind of massive solar outburst.

859
00:49:49,455 --> 00:49:53,095
So there, there, what everybody's agreed on is the Younger Dryas was bad

860
00:49:53,095 --> 00:49:56,275
um, but there is dispute about what caused it.

861
00:49:56,275 --> 00:50:01,175
I personally have found the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis to be the most persuasive

862
00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:04,735
uh, which most effectively explains all the evidence.

863
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:08,215
How important is the impact hypothesis to your understanding of

864
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:11,075
um, the Ice Age advanced civilizations?

865
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:15,975
So is it possible to have another explanation for environmental factors that could have

866
00:50:15,975 --> 00:50:21,275
um, erased most of an advanced civilization during this period?

867
00:50:21,275 --> 00:50:26,255
In a sense, it's not the impact hypothesis that is central to what I'm saying

868
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,695
it's the Younger Dryas that's central to what I'm saying

869
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,015
and the Younger Dryas required a trigger.

870
00:50:31,015 --> 00:50:33,015
Something, something caused it.

871
00:50:33,015 --> 00:50:35,895
Uh, I think the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis

872
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:45,315
the notion that, that we're looking at a debris stream of a fragmenting comet and we can still see that debris stream because it's still up there and we still pass through it twice a year

873
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:47,735
uh, is, is the best explanation.

874
00:50:47,735 --> 00:50:49,895
But I don't mind other explanations.

875
00:50:49,895 --> 00:50:51,955
I, it's good that there are other explanations.

876
00:50:51,955 --> 00:50:55,295
The Younger Dryas is a big mystery and it's not a mystery that's been solved yet.

877
00:50:55,295 --> 00:50:59,895
And that word "advanced civilization," this is another word that

878
00:50:59,895 --> 00:51:05,295
um, uh, that is easily misunderstood, and I've tried to make clear many

879
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:11,955
many times that when we, when we consider the possibility of something like a civilization in the past

880
00:51:11,955 --> 00:51:16,175
we shouldn't imagine that it's us, that it's something like us.

881
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:19,235
We should expect it to be completely different from us

882
00:51:19,235 --> 00:51:22,055
but that it would have achieved certain things.

883
00:51:22,055 --> 00:51:32,795
So amongst the clues that intrigue me are those precessional numbers that are found all around the world and are a category of ancient maps called portolanos

884
00:51:32,795 --> 00:51:37,355
which suddenly started to appear just after the crusade that

885
00:51:37,355 --> 00:51:40,555
uh, entered Constantinople and sacked Constantinople.

886
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:46,095
The portolanos suddenly start to appear, and they're extremely accurate maps.

887
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:50,975
The most of the ones that have survived are extremely accurate maps of the Mediterranean alone

888
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:54,055
but some of them show much wider areas.

889
00:51:54,055 --> 00:52:00,055
For example, on these portolano-style maps, you do find a depiction of Antarctica again and again.

890
00:52:00,055 --> 00:52:10,155
And another thing that these maps have in common is that many of the map makers state that they based their maps on multiple older source maps which have not survived.

891
00:52:10,155 --> 00:52:14,835
These maps are intriguing because they have very accurate relative longitudes.

892
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:23,575
Our civilization did not crack the longitude problem until the mid-18th century with Harrison's chronometer

893
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:25,775
which was able to keep accurate time at sea.

894
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:32,415
So you could have, uh, the time in London and you could have the local time at sea at the same time on

895
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,155
and then you could work out your longitude.

896
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:37,415
Um, there might be other ways of working out longitude as well

897
00:52:37,415 --> 00:52:38,375
but there it is.

898
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:42,915
The fact is these portolanos have extremely accurate relative longitudes.

899
00:52:42,915 --> 00:52:48,975
Secondly, some of them showed the world to my eye as it looked during the Ice Age.

900
00:52:48,975 --> 00:52:51,835
They show a much, a much extended Indonesia

901
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:59,295
uh, and Malaysian peninsula, and the series of islands that make up Indonesia today are all grouped together into one land mass

902
00:52:59,295 --> 00:53:01,375
and that was the case during the Ice Age.

903
00:53:01,375 --> 00:53:03,575
That was the, that was the Sunda Shelf.

904
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:11,455
And the presence of Antarctica on some of these maps also puzzles and intrigues me and is not satisfactorily explained in my view by archeology

905
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:17,175
which says, "Oh, those map makers, they felt that the world needed something underneath it to balance it

906
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:20,420
so they put, uh, a, a fictional land mass there.

907
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,155
" Um, I- I- I don't think that makes sense.

908
00:53:23,155 --> 00:53:25,495
I think somebody was mapping the world, uh

909
00:53:25,495 --> 00:53:28,975
during the last ice age, but that doesn't mean that they had our kind of tech.

910
00:53:28,975 --> 00:53:32,735
Uh, it means that they were following that exploration instinct

911
00:53:32,735 --> 00:53:35,155
that they knew how to navigate.

912
00:53:35,155 --> 00:53:38,515
They'd been watching the stars for thousands of years before.

913
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:42,275
They knew how to navigate and they knew how to build seagoing ships

914
00:53:42,275 --> 00:53:46,015
uh, and they explored the world and they mapped the world.

915
00:53:46,015 --> 00:53:49,795
Those maps very, very, were made a very

916
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:50,955
very long time ago.

917
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:56,335
Some of them I believe were likely preserved in the Library of Alexandria.

918
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:59,115
I think even then they were being copied and recopied.

919
00:53:59,115 --> 00:54:03,995
We don't know exactly what happened to the Library of Alexandria except that it was destroyed.

920
00:54:03,995 --> 00:54:08,555
Uh, I th- I suggest it's likely this was during the period of the Roman Empire.

921
00:54:08,555 --> 00:54:13,175
I suggest it's likely that some of those maps were taken out of the library and taken to Constantinople

922
00:54:13,175 --> 00:54:22,695
uh, and, uh, that's where they were liberated during the crusade and entered world culture again and started to be copied and recopied.

923
00:54:22,695 --> 00:54:28,215
So from this perspective, when, uh, we talk about advanced Ice Age civilization

924
00:54:28,215 --> 00:54:38,655
it could have been a relatively small group of people with the technology of they're scholars of the stars and they're expert seafaring navigators.

925
00:54:38,655 --> 00:54:38,995
Yes.

926
00:54:38,995 --> 00:54:40,495
That's about as far as I would take it.

927
00:54:40,495 --> 00:54:42,335
And when I say that it, uh

928
00:54:42,335 --> 00:54:43,995
as I have said on a number of occasions

929
00:54:43,995 --> 00:54:48,195
that it had technology equivalent to ours in the 18th century

930
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:51,375
I'm referring specifically to the ability to calculate longitude.

931
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:51,695
Yeah.

932
00:54:51,695 --> 00:54:53,735
I'm not saying that they were building steam engines.

933
00:54:53,735 --> 00:54:56,935
Um, I don't see, I don't see any evidence for that.

934
00:54:56,935 --> 00:54:58,409
And perhaps some.

935
00:54:58,409 --> 00:54:58,662
..

936
00:54:58,662 --> 00:54:58,916
..

937
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:02,303
. building tricks and skills of how to

938
00:55:02,303 --> 00:55:03,843
uh, ar- Well, def- well, definitely.

939
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:12,063
And this, this again is where you come to a series of mysteries which are perhaps best expressed on the Giza Plateau in

940
00:55:12,063 --> 00:55:14,523
in, in Egypt with the three great pyramids

941
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:20,964
and the extraordinary megalithic temples that many people don't pay much attention to

942
00:55:20,964 --> 00:55:25,203
uh, on the Giza Plateau, and the Great Sphinx itself.

943
00:55:25,203 --> 00:55:30,523
This is, uh, an area of particular importance in understanding this issue.

944
00:55:30,523 --> 00:55:34,763
Well, can you actually describe the Sphinx and the Great Pyramids- Yeah.

945
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:34,763
.

946
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:34,763
.

947
00:55:34,763 --> 00:55:37,224
and what you find most mysterious and interesting about them?

948
00:55:37,224 --> 00:55:40,203
Well, first of all, the astronomy, uh

949
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:45,043
and here I must pay tribute to two individuals

950
00:55:45,043 --> 00:55:48,323
actually three individuals in particular, one of them is John Anthony West

951
00:55:48,323 --> 00:55:50,423
passed away in 2018.

952
00:55:50,423 --> 00:55:57,403
He was the first person in our era to begin to wonder if the Sphinx was much older than it had been.

953
00:55:57,403 --> 00:56:01,283
Actually he got that idea from a, from a philosopher called Schwaller de Lubicz

954
00:56:01,283 --> 00:56:05,403
who'd noticed what he thought was water erosion on the body of the Sphinx.

955
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:10,843
John West picked that up, and he was a n- great amateur Egyptologist himself

956
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:12,723
he spent most of his life in Egypt and he

957
00:56:12,723 --> 00:56:15,363
he was h- hugely versed in ancient Egypt.

958
00:56:15,363 --> 00:56:17,783
And when he looked at the Sphinx and at the strange

959
00:56:17,783 --> 00:56:22,823
scalloped erosion patterns and the vertical fissures particularly in the trench around the Sphinx

960
00:56:22,823 --> 00:56:26,883
um, he began to think, "Maybe Schwaller was right

961
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,293
maybe this, there was some sign of some sort of flooding here.

962
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:30,923
" And that's when he brought Robert Schoch

963
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:33,403
second person I'd l- I'd like to recognize

964
00:56:33,403 --> 00:56:35,483
geologist at Boston University.

965
00:56:35,483 --> 00:56:40,743
He brought Schoch to Giza, and Schoch was the first geologist to stick his neck out

966
00:56:40,743 --> 00:56:43,623
risk the rire, the ire of Egyptologists

967
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:47,555
and say, "Well it looks to me like the Sphinx was exposed to at least 1

968
00:56:47,555 --> 00:56:49,137
000 years of heavy rainfall.

969
00:56:49,137 --> 00:56:53,743
" And as Schoch's calculations have continued as he's continued to be immersed in this mystery

970
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:59,100
he's continuously pushed that back, and he's now again looking at the date of around 12

971
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,183
000, 12 and a half thousand years ago

972
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,223
during the Younger Dryas, for the creation of the Great Sphinx.

973
00:57:05,223 --> 00:57:08,923
And then, of course this is the period of the w- uh

974
00:57:08,923 --> 00:57:11,383
o- o- of the wet Sahara, the humid Sahara.

975
00:57:11,383 --> 00:57:15,403
The Sahara was a completely different place during the Ice Age

976
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:17,203
there were rivers in it, there were lakes in it

977
00:57:17,203 --> 00:57:20,163
it was fertile, it was possibly densely

978
00:57:20,163 --> 00:57:21,383
densely populated.

979
00:57:21,383 --> 00:57:22,923
And there was a lot of rain.

980
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:27,583
There's not no rain in Giza today, but there's relatively little rain.

981
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:28,863
The next person.

982
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:28,943
..

983
00:57:28,943 --> 00:57:31,803
Not enough rain to cause that erosion damage on the Sphinx.

984
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:35,343
M- The next person who needs to be mentioned in this context is

985
00:57:35,343 --> 00:57:36,603
is Robert Bauval.

986
00:57:36,603 --> 00:57:40,043
Uh, Robert and I have co-authored a number of books together

987
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:43,723
and unfortunately Robert has been very ill for the last seven years.

988
00:57:43,723 --> 00:57:48,823
He's, he's, um, uh, got a very bad chest infection

989
00:57:48,823 --> 00:57:54,583
and I, I think also that, that Robert became very demoralized by the attacks of Egyptologists on his work.

990
00:57:54,583 --> 00:58:02,643
Uh, but Robert is the genius, and it does take a genius sometime to make these connections 'cause nobody had noticed it before

991
00:58:02,643 --> 00:58:08,843
that the three pyramids of Giza are laid out on the ground in the pattern of the three stars of Orion's Belt.

992
00:58:08,843 --> 00:58:13,443
And skeptics will say, "Well you can find any buildings and line them up with any stars you want

993
00:58:13,443 --> 00:58:17,263
" but Orion actually isn't any old constellation.

994
00:58:17,263 --> 00:58:20,543
Orion was the god Osiris, uh, in the sky.

995
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,663
Uh, he was m-.

996
00:58:21,663 --> 00:58:21,783
..

997
00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:24,803
The ancient Egyptians called the Orion Constellation Sahu

998
00:58:24,803 --> 00:58:28,163
and they recognized it as the celestial image of the god Osiris.

999
00:58:28,163 --> 00:58:32,143
So what's been copied on the ground is the belt of a deity

1000
00:58:32,143 --> 00:58:35,743
of a celestial deity, it's not just a random constellation.

1001
00:58:35,743 --> 00:58:39,943
Um, and then when we take precession into account

1002
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:42,943
you find something else very intriguing happening.

1003
00:58:42,943 --> 00:58:49,863
First of all, uh, you find that the exact orientation of the pyramids as it is today

1004
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:53,419
and, and pretty much as it was when they're supposed to have been built 4

1005
00:58:53,419 --> 00:59:00,683
500 years ago, uh, it's, it's not precisely related to how Orion's Belt looked at that time.

1006
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:01,723
There's a, there's a bit of a

1007
00:59:01,723 --> 00:59:04,303
a twist, is they're not, they're not quite right.

1008
00:59:04,303 --> 00:59:08,263
But as you precess the stars backwards, as you go back

1009
00:59:08,263 --> 00:59:12,053
and back, and back, and you come to around 10

1010
00:59:12,053 --> 00:59:14,523
500 BC, 12 and a half thousand years ago

1011
00:59:14,523 --> 00:59:18,043
in the Younger Dryas, you find that suddenly they line up perfectly

1012
00:59:18,043 --> 00:59:20,863
they match perfectly with the three pyramids on the ground.

1013
00:59:20,863 --> 00:59:23,923
And that's the same moment that the Great Sphinx

1014
00:59:23,923 --> 00:59:29,763
an equinoctial monument, aligned perfectly to the rising sun on the spring equinox.

1015
00:59:29,763 --> 00:59:31,503
Anybody can test this for themselves, just

1016
00:59:31,503 --> 00:59:33,803
just go to Giza on the 21st of March

1017
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,363
be there before dawn, stand behind the Sphinx

1018
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:39,923
and you will see the sun rising directly in line with the gaze of the Sphinx.

1019
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:44,063
Um, but the question is, what constellation was behind the Sphinx?

1020
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:45,943
And 12 and a half thousand years ago

1021
00:59:45,943 --> 00:59:47,703
it was the constellation of Leo.

1022
00:59:47,703 --> 00:59:50,983
And actually the constellation of Leo has a very sphinx-like look.

1023
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:58,963
And I, I and my colleagues are pretty sure that the Sphinx was originally a lion entirely

1024
00:59:58,963 --> 01:00:02,943
uh, and that it, over the thousands of years it became damaged

1025
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:06,143
it became eroded, particularly the part of it that

1026
01:00:06,143 --> 01:00:07,863
that sticks out, the head.

1027
01:00:07,863 --> 01:00:13,843
Uh, there were periods when the Sphinx was completely covered in sand but still the head stuck out.

1028
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,063
Um, by the time you come to

1029
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:19,903
to the fourth dynasty when the great pyramids are supposedly built

1030
01:00:19,903 --> 01:00:21,923
by the time you come to the fourth dynasty

1031
01:00:21,923 --> 01:00:23,963
the head of the s- the, the lion

1032
01:00:23,963 --> 01:00:26,863
original lion head would have been a complete mess.

1033
01:00:26,863 --> 01:00:31,103
And we suggest that it was then re-carved into a pharaonic head.

1034
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:35,123
Egyptologists think it was the Pharaoh Khafre, uh

1035
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:40,283
but there's no real strong resemblance, but it's definitely wearing the nemes headdress of

1036
01:00:40,283 --> 01:00:42,123
of a- an ancient Egyptian pharaoh.

1037
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:47,803
Uh, and we think that that's the result of a re-carving of what was originally not only a lion-bodied

1038
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:49,843
but also a lion-headed monument.

1039
01:00:49,843 --> 01:00:55,483
It wouldn't make sense if you create an equinoctial marker in the time of Khafre

1040
01:00:55,483 --> 01:01:00,103
4,500 years ago, and the Sphinx is an equinoctial marker

1041
01:01:00,103 --> 01:01:04,903
I mean it's 270 feet long and 70 feet high and it's looking directly at the rising sun on the equinox.

1042
01:01:04,903 --> 01:01:13,507
If you create it then, uh, you would be betterYou'd be more likely to create it in the shape of a bull because that was the age of Taurus

1043
01:01:13,507 --> 01:01:17,047
when the constellation of Taurus housed the sun on the spring equinox.

1044
01:01:17,047 --> 01:01:18,567
So why is it a lion?

1045
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:24,607
Uh, and, and again, we think that's because of that observation of the skies and

1046
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,967
and, and putting on the ground, as above

1047
01:01:27,967 --> 01:01:32,447
so below, putting on the ground an image of the sky at a particular time.

1048
01:01:32,447 --> 01:01:36,347
Now, the fact that the Giza Plateau

1049
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:39,947
it's a fact, of course, that Egyptologists completely dispute

1050
01:01:39,947 --> 01:01:43,227
but the fact that the principal monuments of the Giza Plateau

1051
01:01:43,227 --> 01:01:49,727
the three great pyramids and the Great Sphinx all lock astronomically on the date of around 10

1052
01:01:49,727 --> 01:01:54,328
500 BC, uh, to me, is most unlikely to be an accident.

1053
01:01:54,328 --> 01:01:57,247
And actually if you look at computer software at the sky at that time

1054
01:01:57,247 --> 01:02:01,107
you'll see, you'll see that the Milky Way is very prominent and

1055
01:02:01,107 --> 01:02:04,107
and seems to be mirrored on the ground by the River Nile.

1056
01:02:04,107 --> 01:02:05,988
I, I suggest that may be one of the reasons

1057
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:08,927
amongst many, why Giza was chosen, uh

1058
01:02:08,927 --> 01:02:12,347
as the site for this, for this very special place.

1059
01:02:12,347 --> 01:02:15,127
So the point I want to make is that

1060
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:26,017
that an astronomical, um, design on the ground which memorializes a very ancient date does not have to have been done 12

1061
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:26,988
500 years ago.

1062
01:02:26,988 --> 01:02:30,315
If, if, if from the ancient Egyptian point of view you're there 4

1063
01:02:30,315 --> 01:02:34,871
500 years ago, uh, and there's a time 8

1064
01:02:34,871 --> 01:02:37,687
000 years before that which is very, very

1065
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:45,727
very important to you, you could mem- you could use astronomical language and megalithic architecture to memorialize that date on the Giza Plateau

1066
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:49,507
which is what we think we're looking at except for one thing

1067
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:51,707
and that's the erosion patterns on the Sphinx.

1068
01:02:51,707 --> 01:02:57,907
Uh, and we're pretty sure that the Sphinx at least does date back to 12 and a half thousand years ago

1069
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:01,447
uh, and with it the megalithic temples

1070
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:05,428
uh, the so-called Valley Temple, uh, which stands

1071
01:03:05,428 --> 01:03:10,747
uh, just, just to the east and just to the south of the Sphinx

1072
01:03:10,747 --> 01:03:13,887
and the Sphinx temple which stands directly ins- in front of the Sphinx.

1073
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:21,007
The Sphinx temple has largely been destroyed, but the Valley Temple attributed to Khafre on no good grounds whatsoever

1074
01:03:21,007 --> 01:03:28,607
um, is a huge megalithic construction with blocks of limestone that weigh up to 100 tons each.

1075
01:03:28,607 --> 01:03:32,767
Um, and yet it has been remodeled

1076
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,767
refaced with granite.

1077
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,947
There are granite blocks that are placed on top of the

1078
01:03:37,947 --> 01:03:45,387
the core limestone blocks, and those core limestone blocks were already eroded when the glanite- granite blocks were put there.

1079
01:03:45,387 --> 01:03:45,727
Why?

1080
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:52,647
Because the granite blocks have actually been purposefully and deliberately cut to fit into the erosion marks on the

1081
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:55,847
we believe, much older megalithic blocks there.

1082
01:03:55,847 --> 01:03:58,687
So I think Giza is a very complicated site.

1083
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:05,627
I would never seek to divorce the dynastic ancient Egyptians from the great pyramids.

1084
01:04:05,627 --> 01:04:10,567
They were closely involved in the construction of the great pyramids as we see them today.

1085
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:19,387
But what I do suggest is that there were very low platforms on the Giza Plateau that are much older and that the

1086
01:04:19,387 --> 01:04:21,407
when we look at the three great pyramids

1087
01:04:21,407 --> 01:04:32,347
we're looking at a renovation and a restoration and a enhancement of much older structures that had existed on the Giza Plateau for a much longer period before that.

1088
01:04:32,347 --> 01:04:35,707
Actually, the Great Pyramid is built around a natural hill

1089
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:41,807
uh, and that natural hill might have been seen as the original primeval mound

1090
01:04:41,807 --> 01:04:44,187
uh, to the, to the, to the ancient Egyptians.

1091
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:49,607
So the idea is that the Sphinx was there long before the pyramids

1092
01:04:49,607 --> 01:04:54,707
and the pyramids were built by the Egyptian to celebrate further a- an already holy place.

1093
01:04:54,707 --> 01:04:55,367
Yeah.

1094
01:04:55,367 --> 01:04:58,587
And there were platforms in place where the pyramids stand.

1095
01:04:58,587 --> 01:05:00,467
Not the pyramids as we see them today

1096
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:03,767
um, but the, the, the bases

1097
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:06,067
the base of those pyramids, uh, was

1098
01:05:06,067 --> 01:05:07,487
was already in place at that time.

1099
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:15,587
So, so what's the case, what's the evidence that the Egyptologists use to make the attributions that they do for the dating of the pyramids and the Sphinx?

1100
01:05:15,587 --> 01:05:21,747
Well, um, the three great pyramids of Giza are different from later pyramids.

1101
01:05:21,747 --> 01:05:24,747
This, this is another problem that I have with  the whole thing

1102
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:29,187
um, is the, the, the story of pyramid building.

1103
01:05:29,187 --> 01:05:30,967
When did it, when did it really begin?

1104
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:34,727
And the timeline that we get from Egyptology is the

1105
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:38,767
the first pyramid is the pyramid of the Pharaoh Djoser

1106
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:42,667
uh, the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, um

1107
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:48,107
about a hundred years or so before the Giza pyramids are built.

1108
01:05:48,107 --> 01:05:51,767
Uh, and then we have this explosion in the Fourth Dynasty

1109
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:54,467
uh, of, of true pyramids.

1110
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:58,147
Uh, we have three of them attributed to a single pharaoh

1111
01:05:58,147 --> 01:06:04,347
Sneferu, who built supposedly the pyramid at Mai Dum and the two pyramids at Dashur

1112
01:06:04,347 --> 01:06:05,707
the Bent and the Red Pyramid.

1113
01:06:05,707 --> 01:06:08,927
Uh, and then within that same 100-year span

1114
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:11,467
uh, we have the Giza pyramids being built.

1115
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:14,427
This is according to the orthodox chronology.

1116
01:06:14,427 --> 01:06:17,787
And then suddenly once the Giza project is finished

1117
01:06:17,787 --> 01:06:21,467
pyramid building goes into a massive slump in ancient Egypt

1118
01:06:21,467 --> 01:06:24,927
uh, and the pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty are

1119
01:06:24,927 --> 01:06:27,067
frankly speaking, a mess outside.

1120
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,847
They're, they're very inferior constructions.

1121
01:06:29,847 --> 01:06:32,007
You can hardly recognize them as pyramids at all

1122
01:06:32,007 --> 01:06:38,867
but what happens when you go inside them is you find that they're extensively covered in hieroglyphs

1123
01:06:38,867 --> 01:06:44,547
uh, and imagery repeating the name of the king who was supposedly buried in that place

1124
01:06:44,547 --> 01:06:48,207
whereas the Giza pyramids have no internal inscriptions whatsoever.

1125
01:06:48,207 --> 01:06:55,847
Uh, what they do, what we do have is one piece of graffiti w- about which there is some controversy.

1126
01:06:55,847 --> 01:07:00,007
Uh, basic statistics, it, it's a six million ton structure.

1127
01:07:00,007 --> 01:07:01,127
.

1128
01:07:01,127 --> 01:07:04,207
Um, i- each side is about 750 feet long.

1129
01:07:04,207 --> 01:07:04,667
Yeah.

1130
01:07:04,667 --> 01:07:07,807
Um, it's aligned almost perfectly to true north

1131
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:12,307
south, east, and west, uh, within three-sixtieths of a single degree.

1132
01:07:12,307 --> 01:07:16,387
The sixtieths because degrees are divided into 60s.

1133
01:07:16,387 --> 01:07:18,360
Um, and, and, um.

1134
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:18,583
..

1135
01:07:18,583 --> 01:07:18,805
..

1136
01:07:18,805 --> 01:07:23,617
. uh, it's the precision of the orientation and the absolute massive size of the thing.

1137
01:07:23,617 --> 01:07:27,638
Uh, plus it's very complicated internal passageways

1138
01:07:27,638 --> 01:07:29,957
uh, that- that- that- that are involved in it.

1139
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:30,264
You.

1140
01:07:30,264 --> 01:07:30,417
..

1141
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:36,817
you know, in the ninth century, the Great Pyramid still had its facing tone- stones in place

1142
01:07:36,817 --> 01:07:40,838
but there were, there was an Arab- a- an Arab caliph

1143
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:47,077
Caliph Al-Ma'mun, who had already realized that other pyramids did have their entrances in the north face.

1144
01:07:47,077 --> 01:07:49,337
Nobody knew where the entrance to the Great Pyramid was.

1145
01:07:49,337 --> 01:07:49,697
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:07:49,697 --> 01:07:52,037
He figured if there's an entrance to this thing

1147
01:07:52,037 --> 01:07:54,037
it's gonna be in the north face somewhere.

1148
01:07:54,037 --> 01:08:01,938
So he put together a team of workers and they went in with sledgehammers and they started smashing where he thought would be the entrance

1149
01:08:01,938 --> 01:08:05,278
and they cut their way into the Great Pyramid

1150
01:08:05,278 --> 01:08:07,917
uh, for a distance of maybe 100 feet

1151
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:12,557
and then the hammering that they did dislodged something.

1152
01:08:12,557 --> 01:08:15,237
They heard a little bit further away something big falling

1153
01:08:15,237 --> 01:08:17,417
and they realized there was a cavity there

1154
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:20,157
and they sa- started heading in that direction

1155
01:08:20,157 --> 01:08:23,577
and then they joined the internal passageway of the sy- uh

1156
01:08:23,577 --> 01:08:27,897
of- of the Great Pyramid, the descending and the ascending corridors that go up.

1157
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:37,617
When you go up the ascending corridor, every one of the internal passageways in the- in the Great Pyramid that people can walk in slopes at an angle of 26 degrees.

1158
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:42,537
That's interesting because the angle of slope of the exterior of the Great Pyramid is 52 degrees.

1159
01:08:42,537 --> 01:08:48,197
So we know mathematicians were at work as well as geometers in the- in- in the creation of the Great Pyramid.

1160
01:08:48,197 --> 01:08:53,057
Um, if you go up the Grand Gallery

1161
01:08:53,057 --> 01:08:54,517
which is at the end of, uh

1162
01:08:54,517 --> 01:08:58,277
the, uh, so-called Ascending Corridor and it's above the so-called Queen's Chamber

1163
01:08:58,277 --> 01:09:02,657
you go up the Grand Gallery, you're eventually going to come to what is known as the King's Chamber

1164
01:09:02,657 --> 01:09:10,676
in which there is a sarcophagus, and that sarcophagus is a little bit too big to have been got in through the narrow entrance passageway.

1165
01:09:10,676 --> 01:09:15,176
It's almost as though the so-called King's Chamber was built around the sarcophagus

1166
01:09:15,176 --> 01:09:16,317
uh, already in place.

1167
01:09:16,317 --> 01:09:20,617
Above the King's Chamber are five other chambers.

1168
01:09:20,617 --> 01:09:22,837
These are known as relieving chambers.

1169
01:09:22,837 --> 01:09:28,697
Uh, the theory was that they were built to relieve the pressure on the King's Chamber of the weight of the monument

1170
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:34,997
but I think what makes that theory dubious is the fact that even lower down where more weight was involved

1171
01:09:34,997 --> 01:09:38,256
you have the Queen's Chamber, and there are no such relieving chambers above that.

1172
01:09:38,256 --> 01:09:45,317
In the top of these five chambers, a British adventurer and vandal called Howard Vyse

1173
01:09:45,317 --> 01:09:48,617
who- who dynamited his way into those chambers in the first place

1174
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,697
allegedly found.

1175
01:09:50,697 --> 01:09:50,756
..

1176
01:09:50,756 --> 01:09:53,636
well, he claims he found the graffiti

1177
01:09:53,636 --> 01:09:58,957
uh, uh, a piece of graffiti left by a work gang naming the Pharaoh Khufu

1178
01:09:58,957 --> 01:09:59,377
and it's true.

1179
01:09:59,377 --> 01:10:02,297
I've been in that chamber and there is the cartouche of Khufu there

1180
01:10:02,297 --> 01:10:10,937
uh, quite- quite recognizable, but the dispute around it is whether that is a genuine piece of graffiti dating from the Old Kingdom

1181
01:10:10,937 --> 01:10:15,357
uh, or whether Howard Vyse, uh, actually put it there himself

1182
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:18,197
uh, because he was in desperate need of money at the time.

1183
01:10:18,197 --> 01:10:21,437
Um, I'm not sure what the answer to that question is.

1184
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:25,257
Another reason why, but it's one of the reasons that- that

1185
01:10:25,257 --> 01:10:29,257
uh, Egyptologists feel confident in saying that the pyramid is the work of Khufu.

1186
01:10:29,257 --> 01:10:32,897
Um, another is what is called the Wadi el-Jarf papyri

1187
01:10:32,897 --> 01:10:35,497
uh, where, uh, on the Red Sea

1188
01:10:35,497 --> 01:10:41,017
uh, uh, a diary, the diary of an individual called Merer was found and he talks about bringing

1189
01:10:41,017 --> 01:10:49,277
um, highly polished limestone, uh, to the Great Pyramid and it's clear that what he's talking about is the facing stones of the Great Pyramid.

1190
01:10:49,277 --> 01:10:51,497
He's not talking about the body of the Great Pyramid.

1191
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:55,257
He's talking about the facing stones of the Great Pyramid during the reign of Khufu.

1192
01:10:55,257 --> 01:10:59,417
So that's another reason why the- the- the Great Pyramid is attributed to Khufu.

1193
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:05,957
Um, but I think, I think that we're- we're- Khufu was undoubtedly involved in the Great Pyramid and in a big way

1194
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:12,897
but I think he was building upon and elaborating a much older structure and I think the heart of that structure is the subterranean chamber

1195
01:11:12,897 --> 01:11:17,217
which is, uh, 100 feet vertically beneath the base of the Great Pyramid.

1196
01:11:17,217 --> 01:11:21,957
Anybody who suffers from claustrophobia will not enjoy being down there.

1197
01:11:21,957 --> 01:11:25,697
You gotta go down a 26-degree sloping corridor

1198
01:11:25,697 --> 01:11:29,977
uh, until, uh, uh, a distance of about 300 feet.

1199
01:11:29,977 --> 01:11:33,662
It's 100 feet vertically, but the slope means you're gonna walk a- a distance of about.

1200
01:11:33,662 --> 01:11:33,717
..

1201
01:11:33,717 --> 01:11:35,157
not walk, you're gonna ape walk.

1202
01:11:35,157 --> 01:11:35,702
You're gonna.

1203
01:11:35,702 --> 01:11:35,777
..

1204
01:11:35,777 --> 01:11:37,177
you're almost gonna have to crawl.

1205
01:11:37,177 --> 01:11:42,457
I've learnt from long experience that the best way to go down these corridors is actually backwards.

1206
01:11:42,457 --> 01:11:46,637
Uh, if you go forward, you keep bumping your head on them 'cause they're only three feet five inches high.

1207
01:11:46,637 --> 01:11:48,577
Uh, you get down to the bottom

1208
01:11:48,577 --> 01:11:53,297
you have a short horizontal passage, and then you get into the subterranean chamber.

1209
01:11:53,297 --> 01:11:59,777
Um, the theory of Egyptology is that this was supposed to be the burial place of Khufu

1210
01:11:59,777 --> 01:12:04,717
but after cutting out that 300-foot-long, 26-degree-sloping

1211
01:12:04,717 --> 01:12:08,817
um, passage, a lot of which passes through bedrock

1212
01:12:08,817 --> 01:12:12,057
and having cut the subterranean chamber out of bedrock

1213
01:12:12,057 --> 01:12:20,117
gone to all that trouble, they decided they wouldn't bury him there and they built what's now known as the Queen's Chamber as his burial chamber

1214
01:12:20,117 --> 01:12:21,917
but then they decided that wouldn't do either

1215
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:26,457
so they then built the King's Chamber and that's where the Pharaoh is supposed to have been buried.

1216
01:12:26,457 --> 01:12:31,077
Those Arab raiders under Caliph Mamun didn't find anything in the Great Pyramid at all.

1217
01:12:31,077 --> 01:12:39,697
So your idea is that, um, the Sphinx and maybe some aspects of the pyramid were much earlier.

1218
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:40,077
Yes.

1219
01:12:40,077 --> 01:12:47,537
And why that's important is i- in that case it would be evidence of some transfer of technology- Yes.

1220
01:12:47,537 --> 01:12:47,563
.

1221
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:47,617
..

1222
01:12:47,617 --> 01:12:49,957
from a much older civilization.

1223
01:12:49,957 --> 01:12:50,237
Yeah.

1224
01:12:50,237 --> 01:12:53,377
The idea is that during the Younger Dryas

1225
01:12:53,377 --> 01:12:58,297
most of that civilization was, uh, either destroyed or damaged- Mm-hmm.

1226
01:12:58,297 --> 01:12:58,297
.

1227
01:12:58,297 --> 01:12:58,297
.

1228
01:12:58,297 --> 01:13:01,057
and they desperately scattered across the w- the globe.

1229
01:13:01,057 --> 01:13:01,977
Seeking refuge.

1230
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:05,897
Seeking refuge and telling stories of, um

1231
01:13:05,897 --> 01:13:08,777
maybe, one, the importance of the stars.

1232
01:13:08,777 --> 01:13:09,097
Mm-hmm.

1233
01:13:09,097 --> 01:13:11,957
Their knowledge about the stars- Yeah.

1234
01:13:11,957 --> 01:13:11,963
.

1235
01:13:11,963 --> 01:13:11,977
..

1236
01:13:11,977 --> 01:13:15,137
and their knowledge about building and knowledge about navigation.

1237
01:13:15,137 --> 01:13:15,477
Mm-hmm.

1238
01:13:15,477 --> 01:13:18,257
That's- that's- that's- that's roughly the idea.

1239
01:13:18,257 --> 01:13:22,057
Uh, so it's interesting that the ancient Egyptians

1240
01:13:22,057 --> 01:13:25,759
uh, have an a- a notion of.

1241
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,054
..

1242
01:13:26,054 --> 01:13:26,349
..

1243
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:28,797
. an epoch that they call Zep Tepi

1244
01:13:28,797 --> 01:13:30,457
which is the first time.

1245
01:13:30,457 --> 01:13:31,818
It means the first time.

1246
01:13:31,818 --> 01:13:33,878
This is when the gods walked the earth.

1247
01:13:33,878 --> 01:13:40,137
Uh, this is when, uh, seven sages brought wisdom to ancient Egypt

1248
01:13:40,137 --> 01:13:43,578
uh, and that is seen as the origin of ancient Egyptian civilization.

1249
01:13:43,578 --> 01:13:44,741
There are king lists in.

1250
01:13:44,741 --> 01:13:44,838
..

1251
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:51,598
By the ancient Egyptians themselves, there are king lists that go wa- go back way beyond the first dynasty

1252
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:54,637
go back 30,000 years into the past in ancient Egypt

1253
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:57,797
considered to be entirely mythical by Egyptologists.

1254
01:13:57,797 --> 01:13:59,737
But nevertheless, it's interesting that there's that

1255
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:02,337
that reference to, to remote time.

1256
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:08,557
Now, what you also have in Egypt are what might almost be described as secret societies.

1257
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:15,758
Uh, the Followers of Horus are one of those specifically tasked with bringing forward the knowledge from the first time

1258
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:18,337
uh, into later periods.

1259
01:14:18,337 --> 01:14:22,157
Uh, the Souls of Pe and Nekhen are another one of these

1260
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:29,057
um, mysterious secret society groups who are possessors of knowledge that they transmit to the future.

1261
01:14:29,057 --> 01:14:40,177
And, and what I'm broadly suggesting is that those survivors of the Younger Dryas cataclysm who settled in Giza may have been relatively small in number.

1262
01:14:40,177 --> 01:14:42,917
It's interesting that, that they are referred to in the

1263
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:47,697
the Edfu Building Texts as Seven Sages because that repeats again and again.

1264
01:14:47,697 --> 01:14:51,097
It, it's, it's also in Mesopotamia, uh

1265
01:14:51,097 --> 01:14:55,937
it's Seven Sages, Seven Apkallu, who come out of the waters of the Persian Gulf and

1266
01:14:55,937 --> 01:15:02,557
and teach people all the skills of agriculture and of architecture and of astronomy.

1267
01:15:02,557 --> 01:15:08,277
It's found, it's found all around the world that there was a relatively small number of people who took refuge in Giza

1268
01:15:08,277 --> 01:15:13,937
who benefited from the survival skills of the hunter-foragers who lived at Giza at that time

1269
01:15:13,937 --> 01:15:17,337
and who also passed on their knowledge to those hunter-foragers.

1270
01:15:17,337 --> 01:15:22,237
But it was not knowledge that was ready to be put into shape at that time

1271
01:15:22,237 --> 01:15:31,697
and that knowledge was then preserved and kept and handled within very secretive groups that passed it down over thousands of years

1272
01:15:31,697 --> 01:15:35,137
and finally it bursts into full form, uh

1273
01:15:35,137 --> 01:15:37,877
in the fourth dynasty in, in ancient Egypt.

1274
01:15:37,877 --> 01:15:43,877
And, and, you know, the notion that knowledge might be transferred over thousands of years

1275
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:47,157
uh, shouldn't be absurd.

1276
01:15:47,157 --> 01:15:50,337
Uh, we know, for example, in the case of ancient Israel

1277
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,417
it goes back to the time of Abraham

1278
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:55,017
which is pretty much, I think, around 2000

1279
01:15:55,017 --> 01:16:00,097
2000 BC, and, and knowledge has been preserved from that time right up to the present day.

1280
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:00,770
So if you can.

1281
01:16:00,770 --> 01:16:00,897
..

1282
01:16:00,897 --> 01:16:03,097
if you can preserve knowledge for 4,000 years

1283
01:16:03,097 --> 01:16:04,537
you can probably preserve it for eight.

1284
01:16:04,537 --> 01:16:07,857
Now, of course, the error bars on this are quite large

1285
01:16:07,857 --> 01:16:10,897
but if, uh, an advanced ice age civilization existed

1286
01:16:10,897 --> 01:16:12,517
where do you think it was?

1287
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:16,097
Where do you think we might find it one day if it existed?

1288
01:16:16,097 --> 01:16:19,417
And, uh, how big do you think it might have been?

1289
01:16:19,417 --> 01:16:23,617
Well, this is where, where I'm often accused of presenting a god of the gaps argument

1290
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:28,377
that I think there was a lost civilization because there's lots of the earth that archeologists have never looked at.

1291
01:16:28,377 --> 01:16:30,157
Of course I'm not thinking that.

1292
01:16:30,157 --> 01:16:33,317
Um, these are very special gaps that I'm interested in

1293
01:16:33,317 --> 01:16:38,357
uh, and I'm interested in them because of all the curiosities and the puzzlement that I've expressed to you before.

1294
01:16:38,357 --> 01:16:41,457
It's, it's not just because there are gaps in the archeological record.

1295
01:16:41,457 --> 01:16:48,637
Um, it's, it's because those gaps involve places that were very interesting places to live during the ice age

1296
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:52,897
and they specifically include the Sahara Desert, uh

1297
01:16:52,897 --> 01:16:55,517
which was not a desert during the ice age and

1298
01:16:55,517 --> 01:16:58,877
and, and went through this warm, wet period when it was very

1299
01:16:58,877 --> 01:16:59,857
very fertile.

1300
01:16:59,857 --> 01:17:03,517
Uh, certainly some archeology has been done in the Sahara

1301
01:17:03,517 --> 01:17:04,797
but it's fractional.

1302
01:17:04,797 --> 01:17:08,417
It's, it's, it's tiny, and I think if we want to get into the origins

1303
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:12,117
true origins of ancient Egyptian civilization, of the peoples of ancient Egypt

1304
01:17:12,117 --> 01:17:13,657
we need to be looking in the Sahara

1305
01:17:13,657 --> 01:17:14,797
uh, for that.

1306
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:22,397
Um, and, and, um, uh, the Amazon rainforest is another example of this.

1307
01:17:22,397 --> 01:17:25,197
I think the Sahara is about nine million square kilometers.

1308
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:31,417
The Amazon that's left under dense cono- canopy rainforest is about five million square kilometers

1309
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:33,517
maybe closer to six.

1310
01:17:33,517 --> 01:17:37,557
Um, and then, uh, you have the continental shelves

1311
01:17:37,557 --> 01:17:40,897
uh, that were submerged by sea level rise at the end of the ice age.

1312
01:17:40,897 --> 01:17:44,557
Now, it's, it's well-established that sea level rose by 400 feet

1313
01:17:44,557 --> 01:17:47,277
but it didn't rise by 400 feet overnight.

1314
01:17:47,277 --> 01:17:50,077
Uh, it, it came in dribs and drabs.

1315
01:17:50,077 --> 01:17:50,377
There were.

1316
01:17:50,377 --> 01:17:50,457
..

1317
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:54,677
There were periods of very rapid, quite significant sea level rise

1318
01:17:54,677 --> 01:17:57,497
and there were periods when the sea level was rising much more

1319
01:17:57,497 --> 01:17:58,717
much more slowly.

1320
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:03,017
So that 400-foot sea level rise is spread out over a period of about 10

1321
01:18:03,017 --> 01:18:05,017
000 years, but there are episodes within it

1322
01:18:05,017 --> 01:18:07,877
like meltwater pulse 1B, like mel- well

1323
01:18:07,877 --> 01:18:10,877
meltwater pulse 1A, when the flooding was

1324
01:18:10,877 --> 01:18:12,257
was really immense.

1325
01:18:12,257 --> 01:18:14,317
How big do you think it might have been?

1326
01:18:14,317 --> 01:18:17,203
And do you think it was across the.

1327
01:18:17,203 --> 01:18:17,297
..

1328
01:18:17,297 --> 01:18:18,357
spread across the globe?

1329
01:18:18,357 --> 01:18:21,297
So if there were expert navigators, uh

1330
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,017
do you think they spread across the globe?

1331
01:18:23,017 --> 01:18:30,637
Well, well, the reason I'm talking about the gaps is I don't know where this civilization started or where it was based.

1332
01:18:30,637 --> 01:18:31,150
All I'm.

1333
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:31,277
..

1334
01:18:31,277 --> 01:18:34,217
All I'm seeing are clues and mysteries and puzzles that

1335
01:18:34,217 --> 01:18:39,057
that, that intrigue me and which suggest to me that something is missing from our past.

1336
01:18:39,057 --> 01:18:42,897
Uh, and I'm not inclined to look for that missing something in

1337
01:18:42,897 --> 01:18:48,857
for example, Northern Europe because Northern Europe was not a very nice place to live during the ice age.

1338
01:18:48,857 --> 01:18:53,977
I mean, nobody smart would, would build a civilization in Northern Europe 12

1339
01:18:53,977 --> 01:18:54,877
000 years ago.

1340
01:18:54,877 --> 01:18:57,837
It was a hideous frozen wasteland.

1341
01:18:57,837 --> 01:19:01,017
The places to look are places that were hospitable and

1342
01:19:01,017 --> 01:19:03,117
and welcoming to human beings during the ice age

1343
01:19:03,117 --> 01:19:06,377
and that of course includes the coastlines that are now underwater.

1344
01:19:06,377 --> 01:19:08,757
Uh, of course it includes the Sahara Desert

1345
01:19:08,757 --> 01:19:11,417
and of course it includes the Amazon rainforest as well.

1346
01:19:11,417 --> 01:19:13,777
All of these places, I think, are candidates

1347
01:19:13,777 --> 01:19:17,697
uh, for, quote-unquote, my lost civilization.

1348
01:19:17,697 --> 01:19:22,537
Um, and because I think, largely from those ancient maps

1349
01:19:22,537 --> 01:19:25,497
that it was a navigating, seafaring civilization

1350
01:19:25,497 --> 01:19:28,297
uh, I suspect that it wasn't only in one place.

1351
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:30,677
Uh, it was probably in a number of places.

1352
01:19:30,677 --> 01:19:33,137
And then I, I can only speculate.

1353
01:19:33,137 --> 01:19:35,830
Uh, maybe, maybe there was, um.

1354
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:36,212
..

1355
01:19:36,212 --> 01:19:38,968
There was a cultural value where it was felt

1356
01:19:38,968 --> 01:19:45,887
it was felt that it was not appropriate to interfere with the lives of hunter foragers at that time.

1357
01:19:45,887 --> 01:19:49,787
Uh, maybe it was felt that, that they should keep their distance from them.

1358
01:19:49,787 --> 01:19:58,368
Just, just as even today, uh, there is a feeling that we shouldn't be interfering too much with the uncontacted tribes in the Amazon rainforest.

1359
01:19:58,368 --> 01:20:01,647
Uh, although in- interestingly, some of those

1360
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:04,047
some of those tribes are now using cell phones.

1361
01:20:04,047 --> 01:20:05,067
Um-  yeah.

1362
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:05,147
.

1363
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:05,307
..

1364
01:20:05,307 --> 01:20:10,327
that possibility may have been there in, in the past and only when we come to a

1365
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:17,627
to a global cataclysm does it become essential to have outreach and actually to take refuge amongst those hunter forager populations.

1366
01:20:17,627 --> 01:20:20,067
That is the hypothesis that I'm putting forward.

1367
01:20:20,067 --> 01:20:24,487
I'm not claiming that it's a fact, but for me it helps to explain the evidence.

1368
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:28,887
So that speaks to one of the challenges that archeologists provide to this idea

1369
01:20:28,887 --> 01:20:31,047
is that there is a lot of evidence- Yeah.

1370
01:20:31,047 --> 01:20:31,147
.

1371
01:20:31,147 --> 01:20:31,347
..

1372
01:20:31,347 --> 01:20:36,268
of humans in the Ice Age and they appear to be all hunter-gatherers.

1373
01:20:36,268 --> 01:20:36,868
Mm-hmm.

1374
01:20:36,868 --> 01:20:43,987
But like you said, only a small percent of areas where humans have lived have been

1375
01:20:43,987 --> 01:20:46,368
um, studied by archeologists.

1376
01:20:46,368 --> 01:20:48,388
That's right, very tiny percent, and even a

1377
01:20:48,388 --> 01:20:52,167
a tiny percent of every archeological site has been studied by archeologists too.

1378
01:20:52,167 --> 01:20:55,847
Typically, 1 to 5% of any archeological site is excavated.

1379
01:20:55,847 --> 01:20:59,927
I mean, that's why, uh, Gobekli Tepe fills my mind with imagination

1380
01:20:59,927 --> 01:21:02,347
especially seeing as a time capsule.

1381
01:21:02,347 --> 01:21:08,488
You know, it's almost certain that there is places on earth we haven't discovered

1382
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:12,427
that once we do, uh, even if it's after the Ice Age

1383
01:21:12,427 --> 01:21:14,727
will change our view of human history.

1384
01:21:14,727 --> 01:21:15,007
Yeah.

1385
01:21:15,007 --> 01:21:17,207
Uh, do you think there is going to be a place.

1386
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:17,307
..

1387
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:20,587
Like what, what, what would be your dream thing to discover

1388
01:21:20,587 --> 01:21:25,207
like Gobekli Tepe, that says a definitive

1389
01:21:25,207 --> 01:21:28,847
like, perturbation to our understanding of Ice Age history?

1390
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:32,047
Some kind of archive, some kind of hall of records.

1391
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:40,607
There's, uh, both mystical associations with the hall of records at Giza from people like the Edgar Cayce Organization.

1392
01:21:40,607 --> 01:21:46,847
There's also ancient Egyptian traditions which suggest that something was concealed

1393
01:21:46,847 --> 01:21:48,287
uh, beneath the Sphinx.

1394
01:21:48,287 --> 01:21:52,047
Um, this is not an idea that is alien to ancient Egypt.

1395
01:21:52,047 --> 01:21:53,887
It's, it's quite present in ancient Egypt.

1396
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:56,247
Uh, so far, as far as I know

1397
01:21:56,247 --> 01:21:59,327
nobody has, um, dug down beneath the Sphinx.

1398
01:21:59,327 --> 01:22:00,927
And of course there's very good reasons for that.

1399
01:22:00,927 --> 01:22:02,607
You don't want to damage the, the

1400
01:22:02,607 --> 01:22:04,387
the place too much, but I, uh

1401
01:22:04,387 --> 01:22:06,467
let's call it the Hall of Records.

1402
01:22:06,467 --> 01:22:08,507
I, I'd, I'd love to find that.

1403
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:12,747
Uh, but I think in a way that's what Gobekli Tepe is.

1404
01:22:12,747 --> 01:22:14,987
Gobekli Tepe is a hall of records.

1405
01:22:14,987 --> 01:22:17,607
You know, it's interesting that, that just as I've

1406
01:22:17,607 --> 01:22:20,707
I've tried to outline, I hope reasonably clearly

1407
01:22:20,707 --> 01:22:24,707
that the three great pyramids of Giza match Orion's Belt in 10

1408
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:27,887
500 BC just as the Sphinx matches Leo in 10

1409
01:22:27,887 --> 01:22:32,127
500 BC, 12,500 years ago or so.

1410
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:35,807
Pillar 43 in Enclosure D at Gobekli Tepe

1411
01:22:35,807 --> 01:22:38,547
uh, contains what a number of researchers

1412
01:22:38,547 --> 01:22:41,387
myself included, regard as an astronomical diagram.

1413
01:22:41,387 --> 01:22:44,087
Martin Sweatman of Edinburgh University has, is

1414
01:22:44,087 --> 01:22:46,247
is, has brought forward the best work in this field

1415
01:22:46,247 --> 01:22:54,087
but it was initially started by a gentleman called Paul Burley who noticed that one of the figures on Pillar 43 is a scorpion

1416
01:22:54,087 --> 01:22:59,347
uh, very much like we represent the constellation of Scorpio today

1417
01:22:59,347 --> 01:23:08,307
um, and that above it is a vulture with outstretched wings which is in a posture very similar to the constellation that we call Sagittarius

1418
01:23:08,307 --> 01:23:11,847
and on that outstretched wing, uh, is a

1419
01:23:11,847 --> 01:23:13,247
a circular object.

1420
01:23:13,247 --> 01:23:19,087
And the suggestion is that it's marking the time when the sun was at the center of the dark rift in the Milky Way

1421
01:23:19,087 --> 01:23:23,967
uh, at the summer solstice, uh, 12 and a half thousand years ago.

1422
01:23:23,967 --> 01:23:25,687
That's, that's what it's marking.

1423
01:23:25,687 --> 01:23:31,823
Uh, and, and, um, it's interesting that the same date can be deduced from Pillar 40.

1424
01:23:31,823 --> 01:23:31,927
..

1425
01:23:31,927 --> 01:23:33,007
Of course it's controversial.

1426
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:36,067
Martin Sweatman's ideas are  by no means accepted by

1427
01:23:36,067 --> 01:23:42,247
by archeology, but he's done very, very thorough detailed statistical work on this and I'm personally convinced.

1428
01:23:42,247 --> 01:23:48,987
So we have a, a time capsule at Gobekli Tepe which is memorializing a date that is at least 1

1429
01:23:48,987 --> 01:23:52,167
200 years before Gobekli Tepe was built, uh

1430
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:57,227
if that dating of 11,600 years ago pro- proves to be absolutely the oldest date

1431
01:23:57,227 --> 01:23:59,587
uh, as it is at, uh, as it is at present.

1432
01:23:59,587 --> 01:24:03,067
The date memorialized on P- Pillar 43 is 12

1433
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:05,567
800 years ago, the beginning of the Younger Dryas

1434
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:08,907
the beginning of the impact event.

1435
01:24:08,907 --> 01:24:12,727
And then Giza does the same thing, but in much larger scale.

1436
01:24:12,727 --> 01:24:14,767
It, it, it draws our.

1437
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:14,827
..

1438
01:24:14,827 --> 01:24:30,687
It uses massive megalithic architecture which is very difficult to destroy and a profound knowledge of astronomy to encode a date in a language that any culture which is sufficiently literate in astronomy will be able to decode.

1439
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:37,247
We don't have to have a script that we can't read like we do with the Indus Valley Civilization or with the Easter Island script.

1440
01:24:37,247 --> 01:24:39,227
We don't have to have a script that can't be interpreted.

1441
01:24:39,227 --> 01:24:47,987
If you use astronomical language then any astronomical literate civilization will be able to give you a date.

1442
01:24:47,987 --> 01:24:51,267
The Hoover Dam has a star map built into it

1443
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:53,407
um, and that star map is, uh

1444
01:24:53,407 --> 01:24:54,807
is, is, is part of a, a

1445
01:24:54,807 --> 01:24:57,747
a, an exhibition that was put there at the founding of the

1446
01:24:57,747 --> 01:25:07,187
of the Hoover Dam, and what it does is it freezes the sky above the Hoover Dam at the moment of its completion and Oscar Hanson

1447
01:25:07,187 --> 01:25:09,427
the artist who created that, uh, piece

1448
01:25:09,427 --> 01:25:16,947
uh, said so specifically that this would be so that any future culture would be able to know the time of the dam's construction.

1449
01:25:16,947 --> 01:25:20,887
So you can use astronomy and architecture to memorialize

1450
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:22,107
uh, a particular date.

1451
01:25:22,107 --> 01:25:23,207
Quick pause.

1452
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:23,807
Bathroom break?

1453
01:25:23,807 --> 01:25:24,587
Sounds good.

1454
01:25:24,587 --> 01:25:29,107
So to me the story that w- we've been talking about

1455
01:25:29,107 --> 01:25:36,407
it is both exciting if the mainstream archeology narrative is correct- Mm-hmm.

1456
01:25:36,407 --> 01:25:36,507
.

1457
01:25:36,507 --> 01:25:36,707
..

1458
01:25:36,707 --> 01:25:39,147
and the one you're constructing is correct.

1459
01:25:39,147 --> 01:25:39,387
Mm-hmm.

1460
01:25:39,387 --> 01:25:45,902
Both are super interesting because the mainstream archeology perspective means that there is something about the human mind.

1461
01:25:45,902 --> 01:25:46,188
..

1462
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:46,474
..

1463
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:51,437
. from which the pyramids, the, these ideas spring natural.

1464
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:51,757
You place- Mm-hmm.

1465
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:51,757
.

1466
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:51,757
.

1467
01:25:51,757 --> 01:25:54,038
humans anywhere, you place them on Mars- Yeah.

1468
01:25:54,038 --> 01:25:54,038
.

1469
01:25:54,038 --> 01:25:54,038
.

1470
01:25:54,038 --> 01:25:55,538
it's gonna come out that way.

1471
01:25:55,538 --> 01:25:55,858
Yeah.

1472
01:25:55,858 --> 01:26:04,898
So that's an interesting story of human psychology that then becomes even more interesting when you evolve out of Africa with homo sapiens

1473
01:26:04,898 --> 01:26:05,938
how they think about the world.

1474
01:26:05,938 --> 01:26:05,958
Yeah.

1475
01:26:05,958 --> 01:26:06,897
That's super interesting.

1476
01:26:06,897 --> 01:26:07,177
Yeah.

1477
01:26:07,177 --> 01:26:09,677
And then, uh, if there's an ancient civilization

1478
01:26:09,677 --> 01:26:13,577
uh, advanced civilization that explains why, uh

1479
01:26:13,577 --> 01:26:16,618
there's so many similar types of ideas that spread

1480
01:26:16,618 --> 01:26:19,657
that means that there's so much undiscovered- Yeah.

1481
01:26:19,657 --> 01:26:19,757
.

1482
01:26:19,757 --> 01:26:19,957
..

1483
01:26:19,957 --> 01:26:20,737
still- Yeah.

1484
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:20,743
.

1485
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:20,757
..

1486
01:26:20,757 --> 01:26:24,731
about the, the sort of the spring of these ideas of civilization that come from.

1487
01:26:24,731 --> 01:26:24,777
..

1488
01:26:24,777 --> 01:26:31,517
So, to me, they're both fascinating so I don't know why there's so much sort of infighting but- I think it's partly territorial.

1489
01:26:31,517 --> 01:26:33,337
I think that, I think that, um.

1490
01:26:33,337 --> 01:26:33,537
..

1491
01:26:33,537 --> 01:26:38,217
I don't, I can't s- can't speak of all archeologists but

1492
01:26:38,217 --> 01:26:42,138
but some archeologists feel very tor- very territorial about their profession

1493
01:26:42,138 --> 01:26:46,157
uh, and they do not feel happy about outsiders

1494
01:26:46,157 --> 01:26:53,277
uh, entering their realm, uh, especially if those outsiders have a large platform.

1495
01:26:53,277 --> 01:27:04,217
Um, and that's w- I've found that the attacks on me by archeologists have increased step by step with the increase of my exposure.

1496
01:27:04,217 --> 01:27:12,437
Uh, uh, I wasn't very interesting to them when I just had one minor bestseller in 1992 with a book called The Sign and the Seal.

1497
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:17,737
Uh, but when Fingerprints of the Gods was published in 1995 and became a

1498
01:27:17,737 --> 01:27:22,437
a global bestseller, then I started to attract their attention and

1499
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:25,137
and, uh, appear to have been regarded as a

1500
01:27:25,137 --> 01:27:26,537
as a threat to them and I, I.

1501
01:27:26,537 --> 01:27:26,657
..

1502
01:27:26,657 --> 01:27:28,217
and that is the case today.

1503
01:27:28,217 --> 01:27:35,197
That is why, uh, Ancient Apocalypse season one was defined as the most dangerous show on Netflix.

1504
01:27:35,197 --> 01:27:40,117
Uh, it's why the Society for American Archeology wrote an open letter to Netflix

1505
01:27:40,117 --> 01:27:44,157
uh, asking Netflix to reclassify the series as science fiction.

1506
01:27:44,157 --> 01:27:49,117
It's why they accused the s- th- they  accused the series of antisemitism

1507
01:27:49,117 --> 01:27:53,677
uh, misogyny, uh, white supremacism, uh

1508
01:27:53,677 --> 01:27:54,187
and a whole.

1509
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:54,257
..

1510
01:27:54,257 --> 01:27:55,517
I don't know, a whole bunch of other

1511
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:56,277
other things like that.

1512
01:27:56,277 --> 01:27:58,217
It's n- nothing to do with anything that's

1513
01:27:58,217 --> 01:27:59,857
that's, that's, that's in the series.

1514
01:27:59,857 --> 01:28:01,977
It was, it was, it, it was like

1515
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:03,597
"We must shut this down.

1516
01:28:03,597 --> 01:28:05,107
This is so dangerous to us.

1517
01:28:05,107 --> 01:28:06,529
" It is certainly not a danger to.

1518
01:28:06,529 --> 01:28:06,577
..

1519
01:28:06,577 --> 01:28:09,417
There are many more dangerous things  in the world than a

1520
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:12,317
than a television series, um, r- going

1521
01:28:12,317 --> 01:28:16,697
going on right now but, but maybe it was seen as a danger to archeology

1522
01:28:16,697 --> 01:28:21,137
that this non-archeologist was in archeological terrain and being

1523
01:28:21,137 --> 01:28:23,702
uh, viewed and seen by large.

1524
01:28:23,702 --> 01:28:23,837
..

1525
01:28:23,837 --> 01:28:25,937
and read by large numbers of people.

1526
01:28:25,937 --> 01:28:27,757
Maybe, maybe that was part of the problem.

1527
01:28:27,757 --> 01:28:29,757
And, and human nature being what it is

1528
01:28:29,757 --> 01:28:33,637
I noticed that, uh, two of my principal cl- uh

1529
01:28:33,637 --> 01:28:39,917
critics, uh, John Hoopes from the University of Kansas and Flint Dibble who's now teaching at the University of Cardiff in

1530
01:28:39,917 --> 01:28:42,557
in Wales in, in the UK, uh

1531
01:28:42,557 --> 01:28:45,357
are both people who like to have media exposure

1532
01:28:45,357 --> 01:28:49,317
um, and, uh, John Hoopes has just recently started his

1533
01:28:49,317 --> 01:28:50,117
uh, YouTube channel.

1534
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:52,597
Flint Dibble has had one for, for quite a while

1535
01:28:52,597 --> 01:28:55,357
uh, v- pretty small number of followers.

1536
01:28:55,357 --> 01:29:03,597
I think that they, they, they feel that they should be the ones who are getting the global attention and that it's not right that I am and

1537
01:29:03,597 --> 01:29:07,737
and that the best way to stop that is to stop me

1538
01:29:07,737 --> 01:29:10,517
uh, to shut me down, to get me canceled

1539
01:29:10,517 --> 01:29:18,777
and basically requiring Netflix to re- relabel my series from a documentary to a science fiction

1540
01:29:18,777 --> 01:29:22,757
which is what they actually had the temerity to suggest to Netflix

1541
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:24,002
uh, that would.

1542
01:29:24,002 --> 01:29:24,057
..

1543
01:29:24,057 --> 01:29:26,677
If that had gone through, if Netflix had listened to them

1544
01:29:26,677 --> 01:29:30,377
that would have effectively been the cancellation of my documentary series.

1545
01:29:30,377 --> 01:29:32,197
It would no longer have been ranked under

1546
01:29:32,197 --> 01:29:36,517
under documentary, so it was a deliberate attempt to shut me down and

1547
01:29:36,517 --> 01:29:40,877
and I see that going on again and again and it's so unfortunate and so unnecessary.

1548
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:43,717
I've become very defensive towards archeology.

1549
01:29:43,717 --> 01:29:45,557
I, I, I hit back.

1550
01:29:45,557 --> 01:29:49,517
Well, after 30 years of these attacks on my work

1551
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,797
uh, I'm tired of it and, and I'm

1552
01:29:51,797 --> 01:29:56,397
I, I do defend myself and sometimes I'm perhaps over vigorous in that defense.

1553
01:29:56,397 --> 01:30:00,557
Maybe I was a little bit too strong in my critique of archeology in the first season

1554
01:30:00,557 --> 01:30:02,237
uh, of Ancient Apocalypse.

1555
01:30:02,237 --> 01:30:07,357
Maybe I should have been a bit gentler and a bit kinder and I've tried to reflect that in the second season

1556
01:30:07,357 --> 01:30:11,417
uh, and, and, and to bring also many more indigenous

1557
01:30:11,417 --> 01:30:16,037
uh, voices into the second season as well as the voices of many more archeologists.

1558
01:30:16,037 --> 01:30:17,237
Yeah.

1559
01:30:17,237 --> 01:30:21,897
In general, I got a chance to get a glimpse of the archeology community and

1560
01:30:21,897 --> 01:30:25,997
um, in, in archeology, in science in general

1561
01:30:25,997 --> 01:30:32,177
I don't have much patience for this kind of arrogance or snark or- Mm.

1562
01:30:32,177 --> 01:30:32,183
.

1563
01:30:32,183 --> 01:30:32,197
..

1564
01:30:32,197 --> 01:30:37,117
dismissal of, uh, general human curiosity- Yeah.

1565
01:30:37,117 --> 01:30:37,157
.

1566
01:30:37,157 --> 01:30:37,237
..

1567
01:30:37,237 --> 01:30:39,257
that I think your work inspires in people

1568
01:30:39,257 --> 01:30:44,097
so that's why, uh, people like Ed Barnhart who I recently had a conversation with

1569
01:30:44,097 --> 01:30:47,877
you know, he radiates sort of kindness and curiosity- Me too.

1570
01:30:47,877 --> 01:30:47,877
.

1571
01:30:47,877 --> 01:30:47,877
.

1572
01:30:47,877 --> 01:30:48,357
as well.

1573
01:30:48,357 --> 01:30:51,537
And it's, like, that kind of approach to ideas

1574
01:30:51,537 --> 01:30:54,837
especially about human history, it inspires people.

1575
01:30:54,837 --> 01:30:55,097
Exactly.

1576
01:30:55,097 --> 01:30:56,497
It inspires millions of people- Exactly.

1577
01:30:56,497 --> 01:30:56,497
.

1578
01:30:56,497 --> 01:30:56,497
.

1579
01:30:56,497 --> 01:30:57,357
to ask questions.

1580
01:30:57,357 --> 01:30:57,717
Exactly.

1581
01:30:57,717 --> 01:30:58,777
I mean, that's why you had, uh

1582
01:30:58,777 --> 01:31:01,517
Keanu Reeves on the n- on the new season and he

1583
01:31:01,517 --> 01:31:04,317
he's basically coming to the show from that same perspective- Yes.

1584
01:31:04,317 --> 01:31:04,323
.

1585
01:31:04,323 --> 01:31:04,337
..

1586
01:31:04,337 --> 01:31:05,017
of curiosity.

1587
01:31:05,017 --> 01:31:08,277
Keanu is, is, is genuinely curious about the past and

1588
01:31:08,277 --> 01:31:10,397
and, uh, very, very interested in it and

1589
01:31:10,397 --> 01:31:13,537
and, and he's bringing to it questions that everybody brings to the past.

1590
01:31:13,537 --> 01:31:15,597
He's, he's speaking for every man, uh

1591
01:31:15,597 --> 01:31:17,137
in, in, in the series.

1592
01:31:17,137 --> 01:31:22,137
So given that, can you maybe steel man the case that

1593
01:31:22,137 --> 01:31:27,437
uh, archeologists make about this period that we've been talking about?

1594
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:34,417
Can you make the case that that is indeed what happened is it was hunter-gatherers for a long time- Mm-hmm.

1595
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:34,483
.

1596
01:31:34,483 --> 01:31:34,617
..

1597
01:31:34,617 --> 01:31:40,257
and then there was a cataclysm, a very difficult period in the human history with the Younger Dryas

1598
01:31:40,257 --> 01:31:45,257
and that changed the environment and then led to this

1599
01:31:45,257 --> 01:31:48,397
the springing up of civilizations at different places on Earth?

1600
01:31:48,397 --> 01:31:48,717
Mm.

1601
01:31:48,717 --> 01:31:50,577
Can you sort of, uh, make the case for that?

1602
01:31:50,577 --> 01:31:52,657
Uh, no, I completely understand why-.

1603
01:31:52,657 --> 01:31:52,905
..

1604
01:31:52,905 --> 01:31:55,825
that is the position of archeology because that's what they found.

1605
01:31:55,825 --> 01:32:00,205
Archeology is very much wishing to define itself as a science.

1606
01:32:00,205 --> 01:32:05,385
Uh, and, uh, it uses the techniques of weighing and measuring and counting

1607
01:32:05,385 --> 01:32:08,745
are very key to- to what archeology does.

1608
01:32:08,745 --> 01:32:13,546
And in what they found and what they've studied around the world

1609
01:32:13,546 --> 01:32:17,446
uh, they don't see any traces of- of a lost civilization.

1610
01:32:17,446 --> 01:32:19,593
And- and the idea that, um.

1611
01:32:19,593 --> 01:32:19,826
..

1612
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:21,898
besides the- the.

1613
01:32:21,898 --> 01:32:22,065
..

1614
01:32:22,065 --> 01:32:24,966
W- we live in a very politically correct world today

1615
01:32:24,966 --> 01:32:33,306
and the idea that- that, uh, some kind of lost civilization brought knowledge to other cultures around the world is seen as almost

1616
01:32:33,306 --> 01:32:36,125
uh, racist or colonialist in some, in some way.

1617
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:39,145
It triggers, it triggers that aspect as- as- as well.

1618
01:32:39,145 --> 01:32:43,885
But basically, arc- I think m- majority of archeologists are in complete good faith on this.

1619
01:32:43,885 --> 01:32:47,945
I- I- I- I don't think that anybody's r- really seeking to frame me.

1620
01:32:47,945 --> 01:32:52,206
I think that, I think that what- what we're hearing from most archeologists

1621
01:32:52,206 --> 01:32:56,685
some much more vicious than others, but what we're hearing from most archeologists is

1622
01:32:56,685 --> 01:33:01,105
"This is what we found and we don't see evidence for a lost civilization in it.

1623
01:33:01,105 --> 01:33:05,285
" Uh, and to that I- I must reply

1624
01:33:05,285 --> 01:33:07,285
please look at the myths.

1625
01:33:07,285 --> 01:33:11,085
Please consider the implications of the Younger Dryas.

1626
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:12,905
Please look at the ancient astronomy.

1627
01:33:12,905 --> 01:33:17,045
Please look at those ancient maps and don't just dismiss them and sneer at them.

1628
01:33:17,045 --> 01:33:27,865
And for God's sake, please look more deeply at the parts of the world that were immensely habitable and attractive during the Ice Age and that have hardly been studied by archeology at all

1629
01:33:27,865 --> 01:33:33,325
uh, before you tell us that your theory is the only one that can possibly be correct.

1630
01:33:33,325 --> 01:33:40,265
In fact, it's a very, it's a very arrogant and silly position of archeology because archeologic- archeological theories are always being overthrown.

1631
01:33:40,265 --> 01:33:41,565
It can take years.

1632
01:33:41,565 --> 01:33:42,565
It can take decades.

1633
01:33:42,565 --> 01:33:48,265
It took decades in the curse, case of the Clovis first hypothesis for the settlement of the Americas.

1634
01:33:48,265 --> 01:33:50,885
Uh, but sooner or later, a bad idea

1635
01:33:50,885 --> 01:33:56,745
uh, will be kicked out by a preponderance of evidence that that idea does not explain.

1636
01:33:56,745 --> 01:33:59,305
If we can just look back at your

1637
01:33:59,305 --> 01:34:01,525
uh, debate with Flint Dibble- Mm-hmm.

1638
01:34:01,525 --> 01:34:01,591
.

1639
01:34:01,591 --> 01:34:01,725
..

1640
01:34:01,725 --> 01:34:05,205
on Joe Rogan Experience, what are some takeaways from that?

1641
01:34:05,205 --> 01:34:07,945
Uh, what have you learned maybe?

1642
01:34:07,945 --> 01:34:10,585
What are some things you like about Flint?

1643
01:34:10,585 --> 01:34:13,425
You said that he's one of th- your big critics.

1644
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:13,465
Yeah.

1645
01:34:13,465 --> 01:34:15,465
But what do you like about his ideas and what

1646
01:34:15,465 --> 01:34:17,845
uh, what were you maybe bothered by?

1647
01:34:17,845 --> 01:34:21,165
First of all, just very recently, and it can be found on my YouTube channel

1648
01:34:21,165 --> 01:34:23,605
uh, channel, and it's signaled on- on my website

1649
01:34:23,605 --> 01:34:26,525
I- I have made a- a video, runs about an hour

1650
01:34:26,525 --> 01:34:34,245
uh, which looks at a series of statements that Flint made during the debate which I was not prepared to answer.

1651
01:34:34,245 --> 01:34:40,585
Um, and it turns out that some of those statements are not correct.

1652
01:34:40,585 --> 01:34:46,965
Uh, the- the notion, for example, that there were three million shipwrecks

1653
01:34:46,965 --> 01:34:49,445
uh, that have been mapped.

1654
01:34:49,445 --> 01:34:53,585
Flint actually uses the word mapped, three million shipwrecks that have been mapped

1655
01:34:53,585 --> 01:34:57,705
at one point in the debate, and I've- I've put that clip into the video that I brought out.

1656
01:34:57,705 --> 01:35:00,585
That is not a fact, that is an estimate

1657
01:35:00,585 --> 01:35:01,945
a UNESCO estimate.

1658
01:35:01,945 --> 01:35:08,245
Um, and- and actually in the small print on one of the slides that he has on the screen you can see the word estimate

1659
01:35:08,245 --> 01:35:12,265
but he never expresses that word outlie- out loud.

1660
01:35:12,265 --> 01:35:16,165
So those who are listening to the podcast rather than watching it wouldn't even have a chance to see that

1661
01:35:16,165 --> 01:35:19,445
and I sitting there in the studio didn't see that word estimate either.

1662
01:35:19,445 --> 01:35:20,585
And I didn't know that.

1663
01:35:20,585 --> 01:35:23,345
I thought, "My God, Flint has a point here.

1664
01:35:23,345 --> 01:35:26,945
If there'd been three million shipwrecks found and mapped

1665
01:35:26,945 --> 01:35:33,769
if that's the case, the absence of any shipwreck from a lost civilization of the Ice Age is a problem.

1666
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:37,705
" But then I discover that it isn't three million shipwrecks that have been mapped.

1667
01:35:37,705 --> 01:35:39,445
It's much, much less than that.

1668
01:35:39,445 --> 01:35:41,465
Maybe it's 250,000.

1669
01:35:41,465 --> 01:35:45,141
Uh, still a large number, uh, but most of them from the last 1

1670
01:35:45,141 --> 01:35:45,925
000 years.

1671
01:35:45,925 --> 01:35:49,925
Uh, and- and, uh, unfortunately what Flint didn't go into

1672
01:35:49,925 --> 01:35:51,705
and perhaps he should have shared with the audience

1673
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:53,185
and again I go into this in the

1674
01:35:53,185 --> 01:35:55,365
in the video, is that there is

1675
01:35:55,365 --> 01:35:59,225
uh, indisputable evidence that human beings were seafarers

1676
01:35:59,225 --> 01:36:01,265
uh, as much as 50 or 60

1677
01:36:01,265 --> 01:36:02,165
000 years ago.

1678
01:36:02,165 --> 01:36:06,625
The peopling of Australia involved a- a relatively short 90 kilometers

1679
01:36:06,625 --> 01:36:12,005
100 kilometer ocean voyage, but nevertheless it was an ocean voyage and it must have involved a large enough people

1680
01:36:12,005 --> 01:36:17,565
uh, a large enough number of people to create a permanent population that wouldn't go extinct.

1681
01:36:17,565 --> 01:36:19,805
The settlement of Cyprus is the same thing.

1682
01:36:19,805 --> 01:36:21,985
It was always an island even during the Ice Age

1683
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:27,465
um, and, uh, no ships have survived that speak to the settlement of Australia

1684
01:36:27,465 --> 01:36:30,525
and no ships have survived that speak to the settlement of Cyprus either

1685
01:36:30,525 --> 01:36:32,625
but that doesn't mean that that thing didn't happen.

1686
01:36:32,625 --> 01:36:35,005
I- I should just, like, linger on this because for me it was

1687
01:36:35,005 --> 01:36:38,385
the shipwrecks thing was convincing, and then looking back

1688
01:36:38,385 --> 01:36:43,165
first of all watching your video but also just realizing the peopling of Australia part

1689
01:36:43,165 --> 01:36:45,945
that's mind boggling to me.

1690
01:36:45,945 --> 01:36:46,125
Yeah.

1691
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:47,565
50,000 years ago.

1692
01:36:47,565 --> 01:36:47,685
Yeah.

1693
01:36:47,685 --> 01:36:53,025
Just imagine being the person standing on the shore looking out into the ocean

1694
01:36:53,025 --> 01:36:59,085
standing on the shore of a harsh environment looking out into the ocean of an even harsher environment and deciding that

1695
01:36:59,085 --> 01:37:02,725
you know what, I'm going to go towards near certain death- Mm-hmm.

1696
01:37:02,725 --> 01:37:02,731
.

1697
01:37:02,731 --> 01:37:02,745
..

1698
01:37:02,745 --> 01:37:03,645
and explore.

1699
01:37:03,645 --> 01:37:05,825
I don't know what's on the other side of that water.

1700
01:37:05,825 --> 01:37:06,785
You can't see 90 kilometers.

1701
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:07,625
And humans did it.

1702
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:08,325
Yeah, yeah.

1703
01:37:08,325 --> 01:37:08,705
Man, I love humans so much.

1704
01:37:08,705 --> 01:37:11,125
And again, it's that, it's that, it's that urge to explore.

1705
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:11,485
Yeah.

1706
01:37:11,485 --> 01:37:16,865
And I suggest that it- it probably began with a few pioneers who made the journey there and back.

1707
01:37:16,865 --> 01:37:20,125
They ventured into the water, they definitely had boats

1708
01:37:20,125 --> 01:37:26,105
uh, and lo and behold after a two or three day voyage they ended up on a coastline.

1709
01:37:26,105 --> 01:37:34,265
You're an individual, you've got by relatively straightforward island hopping with w- where each island is within sight of each other as far as Timor

1710
01:37:34,265 --> 01:37:38,065
and when you get to Timor suddenly you can't island hop anymore.

1711
01:37:38,065 --> 01:37:40,605
There's an expansive ocean that you can't see across.

1712
01:37:40,605 --> 01:37:52,785
But that urge to explore, that curiosity that is central to the human condition would undoubtedly have led some adventurous individuals to want to find out more

1713
01:37:52,785 --> 01:37:54,525
and even be willing to risk their lives.

1714
01:37:54,525 --> 01:38:02,605
And that- that first reconnoitering of what lay beyond that strait would have undoubtedly been undertaken by very few individuals

1715
01:38:02,605 --> 01:38:06,705
uh, not enough to create a permanent population in Australia.

1716
01:38:06,705 --> 01:38:11,721
But when they came back with the good news that there's a whole land there-That's the

1717
01:38:11,721 --> 01:38:13,401
that's the land that was in it, that

1718
01:38:13,401 --> 01:38:16,381
that, uh, geographers call, uh, Sahul

1719
01:38:16,381 --> 01:38:25,301
which in, just as Sunda, uh, was the Ice Age Indonesian and Malaysian peninsula all joined together into one landmass.

1720
01:38:25,301 --> 01:38:28,841
So Sahul was New Guinea joined to Australia.

1721
01:38:28,841 --> 01:38:31,641
So they would have made landfall in New Guinea.

1722
01:38:31,641 --> 01:38:34,801
And then they think, "Well, here is this vast

1723
01:38:34,801 --> 01:38:36,221
open, incredible land.

1724
01:38:36,221 --> 01:38:38,724
Uh, we need to bring more people here.

1725
01:38:38,724 --> 01:38:43,182
" Uh, and, and th- that would have involved larger sh- larger craft.

1726
01:38:43,182 --> 01:38:45,341
Uh, you, you need to bring people

1727
01:38:45,341 --> 01:38:49,321
uh, with resources, and you bring, need to bring enough of them

1728
01:38:49,321 --> 01:38:54,481
both men and women, in order to produce a population that will not rapidly become extinct.

1729
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:56,342
And, and it's the same in Cyprus.

1730
01:38:56,342 --> 01:39:07,349
There, the, the detailed work that's been done suggests very strongly that we're looking at planned migrations of groups of people in excess of 1

1731
01:39:07,349 --> 01:39:10,001
000 at a time, bringing animals with them

1732
01:39:10,001 --> 01:39:13,221
and this certainly would have involved multiple boats

1733
01:39:13,221 --> 01:39:15,602
and boats of a, of a significant size.

1734
01:39:15,602 --> 01:39:18,702
And there's no archaeological evidence of those boats?

1735
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:19,482
None whatsoever.

1736
01:39:19,482 --> 01:39:23,181
The oldest boat that's ever been found in the world is the Dorcos shipwreck off Greece

1737
01:39:23,181 --> 01:39:26,202
which is around 5,000 years old, if I recall correctly.

1738
01:39:26,202 --> 01:39:30,241
So everything that's makes a boat is lost to time?

1739
01:39:30,241 --> 01:39:30,901
Yes.

1740
01:39:30,901 --> 01:39:33,641
Uh, b- boats can be preserved under certain circumstances.

1741
01:39:33,641 --> 01:39:35,441
There's a wreck at the bottom of the Black Sea

1742
01:39:35,441 --> 01:39:36,862
almost two miles deep.

1743
01:39:36,862 --> 01:39:38,581
I, I didn't know the Black Sea was that deep.

1744
01:39:38,581 --> 01:39:40,702
 But there's a wreck, and there's no oxygen down there.

1745
01:39:40,702 --> 01:39:43,629
Um, that is, uh, that is more than 2

1746
01:39:43,629 --> 01:39:46,741
000 years old and i- is still in pretty much perfect condition.

1747
01:39:46,741 --> 01:39:47,501
Um- Sure.

1748
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:47,501
.

1749
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:47,501
.

1750
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:52,841
but in other conditions, uh, th- the structure of the ship evaporates.

1751
01:39:52,841 --> 01:39:55,001
Sometimes what you're left with is the cargo of the ship

1752
01:39:55,001 --> 01:39:56,882
and you could say there was a ship that sank here

1753
01:39:56,882 --> 01:39:59,902
but the ship itself has, the ship itself has gone.

1754
01:39:59,902 --> 01:40:04,911
Uh, the fact is, we know that our ancestors were seafarers as much as 50

1755
01:40:04,911 --> 01:40:08,261
000 years ago, and no ship has survived to testify to that.

1756
01:40:08,261 --> 01:40:09,781
Yet we accept that they were.

1757
01:40:09,781 --> 01:40:13,761
Do you think, do you think one day we'll find a ship that's 10

1758
01:40:13,761 --> 01:40:16,721
20, 30, 40, 50,000 years old?

1759
01:40:16,721 --> 01:40:18,501
Uh, it's not impossible.

1760
01:40:18,501 --> 01:40:21,441
Um, I, I think it's, I think it's quite unlikely

1761
01:40:21,441 --> 01:40:25,541
given the, given the very thin survival of ships the further back you go in time

1762
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:27,481
uh, with the oldest, as I say

1763
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:29,761
being about 6,000 years old now.

1764
01:40:29,761 --> 01:40:36,081
And then the other, the other thing to take into account is the Younger Dryas event itself and the

1765
01:40:36,081 --> 01:40:38,401
the cataclysmic circumstances of that event.

1766
01:40:38,401 --> 01:40:44,021
And, and, and, um, the roiling of the seas that would have taken place then.

1767
01:40:44,021 --> 01:40:46,281
H- How much would have survived in a

1768
01:40:46,281 --> 01:40:51,061
in a, in a boat accident at that time would have survived for thousands of years afterwards?

1769
01:40:51,061 --> 01:40:52,081
I, I, I'm not sure.

1770
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:53,641
But I, I don't give up hope.

1771
01:40:53,641 --> 01:40:54,201
It's possible.

1772
01:40:54,201 --> 01:40:58,841
So, okay, so that's back to the three million shipwrecks.

1773
01:40:58,841 --> 01:40:59,341
Yeah.

1774
01:40:59,341 --> 01:41:00,901
So what's your takeaway from that debate?

1775
01:41:00,901 --> 01:41:01,425
Uh.

1776
01:41:01,425 --> 01:41:01,561
..

1777
01:41:01,561 --> 01:41:03,601
Well, my takeaway from that debate is

1778
01:41:03,601 --> 01:41:06,221
um, that  I should have been better prepared.

1779
01:41:06,221 --> 01:41:08,521
Uh, and, and I should have been less angry.

1780
01:41:08,521 --> 01:41:09,969
Uh, uh, uh, I've.

1781
01:41:09,969 --> 01:41:10,141
..

1782
01:41:10,141 --> 01:41:11,901
I have to say that Flint had, had

1783
01:41:11,901 --> 01:41:16,861
had really, um, disturbed me with the

1784
01:41:16,861 --> 01:41:23,681
these, this constant snide, not quite exact references to racism and white supremacism in

1785
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:24,741
in, in my work.

1786
01:41:24,741 --> 01:41:27,401
I, I, I detest such things.

1787
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:30,625
Uh, and to have those labels stuck on me.

1788
01:41:30,625 --> 01:41:30,681
..

1789
01:41:30,681 --> 01:41:34,701
He's always avoided taking direct responsibility, pretty much always avoided.

1790
01:41:34,701 --> 01:41:37,881
There's one example that I include in the video I've made

1791
01:41:37,881 --> 01:41:41,041
uh, where he really hasn't successfully avoided it

1792
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:45,481
but in most cases, he's trying to say that I rely on sources that were racist

1793
01:41:45,481 --> 01:41:46,363
but that.

1794
01:41:46,363 --> 01:41:46,501
..

1795
01:41:46,501 --> 01:41:48,901
h- he's not saying that I myself am a racist.

1796
01:41:48,901 --> 01:41:53,801
But the end result of those statements is that people all around the world

1797
01:41:53,801 --> 01:41:58,261
uh, came to the conclusion that Graham Hancock is a racist and a white supremacist.

1798
01:41:58,261 --> 01:42:00,881
And that really got under my skin, and it really upset me

1799
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:03,041
and I felt, I felt angry about it

1800
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,041
and I felt that I was there, uh

1801
01:42:05,041 --> 01:42:08,401
to defend Ancient Apocalypse season one, whereas

1802
01:42:08,401 --> 01:42:14,761
in fact, what I was there to do was to listen to a series of lectures where an archaeologist tells me what archaeologists have found

1803
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:18,361
and that somehow I'm to deduce that from what they have found

1804
01:42:18,361 --> 01:42:20,301
they're not gonna find anything else.

1805
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:23,181
At least not anything to do with the lost civilization.

1806
01:42:23,181 --> 01:42:24,741
Listen, I feel you.

1807
01:42:24,741 --> 01:42:28,541
I've seen the intensity of the attacks, and the whole racism label i- is

1808
01:42:28,541 --> 01:42:30,961
uh, is the one that can get under your skin.

1809
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:34,201
And it's, it's a toolbox that's been prevalent over the past

1810
01:42:34,201 --> 01:42:35,461
let's say decade- Mm-hmm.

1811
01:42:35,461 --> 01:42:35,467
.

1812
01:42:35,467 --> 01:42:35,481
..

1813
01:42:35,481 --> 01:42:39,181
maybe a little bit more, as a method of cancellation- Yeah.

1814
01:42:39,181 --> 01:42:39,187
.

1815
01:42:39,187 --> 01:42:39,201
..

1816
01:42:39,201 --> 01:42:40,294
when, when a person has.

1817
01:42:40,294 --> 01:42:40,421
..

1818
01:42:40,421 --> 01:42:43,601
uh, is the opposite of racist, very often.

1819
01:42:43,601 --> 01:42:45,041
It's kind of hilarious to watch.

1820
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:47,001
But it can get under your skin- Mm-hmm.

1821
01:42:47,001 --> 01:42:47,007
.

1822
01:42:47,007 --> 01:42:47,021
..

1823
01:42:47,021 --> 01:42:57,921
especially when you have certain, uh, dynamics that happen on the internet where it seeps into a Wikipedia page and then other people read that Wikipedia page and you get to hear it from

1824
01:42:57,921 --> 01:42:58,641
like, friends.

1825
01:42:58,641 --> 01:43:00,881
"Oh, I didn't know you're a" whatever

1826
01:43:00,881 --> 01:43:01,741
and then you- Mm-hmm.

1827
01:43:01,741 --> 01:43:01,741
.

1828
01:43:01,741 --> 01:43:01,741
.

1829
01:43:01,741 --> 01:43:05,861
you realize that Wikipedia description of who you are is actually has a lot of power.

1830
01:43:05,861 --> 01:43:06,281
Mm-hmm.

1831
01:43:06,281 --> 01:43:12,281
Not by people that know you well, but by people that just kind of are learning about you for the first time.

1832
01:43:12,281 --> 01:43:12,901
Oh, yeah, definitely.

1833
01:43:12,901 --> 01:43:17,261
And they can really start to annoy you and get under your skin when people are- Totally.

1834
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:17,261
Totally.

1835
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:17,274
.

1836
01:43:17,274 --> 01:43:17,301
..

1837
01:43:17,301 --> 01:43:19,954
kind of indirectly injecting.

1838
01:43:19,954 --> 01:43:20,081
..

1839
01:43:20,081 --> 01:43:24,461
They're writing articles about you that can then be cited by Wikipedia.

1840
01:43:24,461 --> 01:43:24,581
Yeah.

1841
01:43:24,581 --> 01:43:28,281
It can really bother a person who is actually trying to do good science and

1842
01:43:28,281 --> 01:43:30,541
or just trying to inspire people with different ideas.

1843
01:43:30,541 --> 01:43:33,161
I felt that my work was being deliberately misrepresented.

1844
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:33,321
Yeah.

1845
01:43:33,321 --> 01:43:35,741
Uh, and I felt that I as a human being were being.

1846
01:43:35,741 --> 01:43:35,861
..

1847
01:43:35,861 --> 01:43:38,701
wo- was, was being insulted and wronged

1848
01:43:38,701 --> 01:43:41,601
uh, in, in ways that are deeply hurtful.

1849
01:43:41,601 --> 01:43:45,901
Um, my wife and I have, have six children between us

1850
01:43:45,901 --> 01:43:47,541
and we have nine grandchildren.

1851
01:43:47,541 --> 01:43:51,381
And of those nine grandchildren, seven are of mixed race.

1852
01:43:51,381 --> 01:43:54,061
Um, and, and this is my family.

1853
01:43:54,061 --> 01:44:01,401
And these are kids who are gonna grow up and read Wikipedia and learn from reading Wikipedia that Grandpa was some kind of racist

1854
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:02,141
you know?

1855
01:44:02,141 --> 01:44:07,481
This is a personal issue for me, and I'm afraid I carried that personal anger into the debate and

1856
01:44:07,481 --> 01:44:11,101
and it made me less effective than I should have been.

1857
01:44:11,101 --> 01:44:13,241
But ultimately, I do want to pay tribute to Flint.

1858
01:44:13,241 --> 01:44:14,801
He is an excellent debater.

1859
01:44:14,801 --> 01:44:16,801
He's got a very sharp mind.

1860
01:44:16,801 --> 01:44:20,381
He's a very clever man, and he's very fast on his feet.

1861
01:44:20,381 --> 01:44:22,161
And I recognize that.

1862
01:44:22,161 --> 01:44:25,461
I, I was definitely up against a superior debater

1863
01:44:25,461 --> 01:44:26,821
uh, in that debate.

1864
01:44:26,821 --> 01:44:29,161
I'm not sure that I have those debating skills

1865
01:44:29,161 --> 01:44:29,821
and I certainly-  .

1866
01:44:29,821 --> 01:44:29,821
..

1867
01:44:29,821 --> 01:44:32,521
didn't have them on, on that particular day.

1868
01:44:32,521 --> 01:44:35,281
I also admire about Flint, uh, something else

1869
01:44:35,281 --> 01:44:37,201
which is that he was willing to be there.

1870
01:44:37,201 --> 01:44:39,701
Uh, most archaeologists don't want to talk to me at all.

1871
01:44:39,701 --> 01:44:41,741
They want to insult me from the sidelines.

1872
01:44:41,741 --> 01:44:49,581
Uh, they want to make sure that Wikipedia keeps on calling me a pseudoarchaeologist or a per- purveyor of pseudoarchaeological theories.

1873
01:44:49,581 --> 01:44:51,239
They want to make sure that the hints of-.

1874
01:44:51,239 --> 01:44:51,409
..

1875
01:44:51,409 --> 01:44:54,589
racism are there, but they actually don't want to sit down and confront me.

1876
01:44:54,589 --> 01:44:56,489
At least Flint was willing to do that

1877
01:44:56,489 --> 01:45:02,389
and I'm grateful to him for that, and I- I think in- in that sense it is an important encounter between people with

1878
01:45:02,389 --> 01:45:08,229
uh, let's say, an alternative view of history and those with a very much mainstream view of history that archeology gives us.

1879
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:11,049
And he's also a- a very determined character.

1880
01:45:11,049 --> 01:45:12,629
He- he- he- he doesn't give up.

1881
01:45:12,629 --> 01:45:14,449
So all- all of those things about him

1882
01:45:14,449 --> 01:45:17,729
I- I admire and- and- and respect.

1883
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:22,369
Um, but, um, uh, I think he fought dirty during the debate

1884
01:45:22,369 --> 01:45:26,810
and I've said exactly why, uh, in this video that I now have up on YouTube.

1885
01:45:26,810 --> 01:45:28,830
To say a positive thing that I enjoyed

1886
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:33,569
I think towards the end in him speaking about agriculture was pretty interesting.

1887
01:45:33,569 --> 01:45:33,789
Yeah.

1888
01:45:33,789 --> 01:45:37,610
So the techniques of, uh, archeology are pretty interesting

1889
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:44,129
like, where , where you can get some insights through the fog of time- Mm-hmm.

1890
01:45:44,129 --> 01:45:44,135
.

1891
01:45:44,135 --> 01:45:44,149
..

1892
01:45:44,149 --> 01:45:46,070
about, like, what people were doing- Yeah.

1893
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:46,076
.

1894
01:45:46,076 --> 01:45:46,089
..

1895
01:45:46,089 --> 01:45:46,990
how they were living.

1896
01:45:46,990 --> 01:45:47,789
That's pretty interesting.

1897
01:45:47,789 --> 01:45:48,910
It's- it's very interesting.

1898
01:45:48,910 --> 01:45:52,829
It's a very important discipline, and I've said many times before publicly

1899
01:45:52,829 --> 01:45:56,169
I couldn't do any of my work without the work that archeologists do.

1900
01:45:56,169 --> 01:46:02,549
I emphasize very strongly in this video that I don't study what archeologists study.

1901
01:46:02,549 --> 01:46:11,949
Um, but nevertheless, the data that archeologists have generated over the last century or so has been incredibly valuable to me in the work that I do.

1902
01:46:11,949 --> 01:46:17,869
But when I- when I look at the Great Sphinx and the studies of archeology saying that this is the work of the Pharaoh Khafre

1903
01:46:17,869 --> 01:46:22,809
despite the absence of any single contemporary inscri- inscription that ascribes it to Khafre

1904
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:27,689
and in fact the presence of other inscriptions that say that it was already there in the time of Khufu

1905
01:46:27,689 --> 01:46:30,729
uh, I- I am not looking at what Egyptologists study.

1906
01:46:30,729 --> 01:46:33,989
They just dismiss all of that and lock into the Khafre

1907
01:46:33,989 --> 01:46:35,189
uh, connection.

1908
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:39,609
At Gobekli Tepe, I'm- I'm not really looking at what archeologists look at.

1909
01:46:39,609 --> 01:46:45,789
I'm looking at the alignments of the megaliths and how they seem to track precession of the star Sirius over a period of time.

1910
01:46:45,789 --> 01:46:48,469
Archeologists aren't interested in- in any of that.

1911
01:46:48,469 --> 01:46:50,989
So I- I value and respect archeology.

1912
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:54,969
I think it's an incredible tool for investigating our past

1913
01:46:54,969 --> 01:47:02,009
but I wish archeologists would bring a slightly gentler frame of mind to it and a slightly opener perspective

1914
01:47:02,009 --> 01:47:09,009
and also that- that archeologists would be willing to trust the general public to make up their own minds.

1915
01:47:09,009 --> 01:47:15,069
It's as though certain archeologists are afraid of the public being presented with an alternative point of view

1916
01:47:15,069 --> 01:47:18,469
which they regard as, quote-unquote, "dangerous," uh

1917
01:47:18,469 --> 01:47:24,369
because they somehow underestimate the intelligence of the general public and think the general public are just going to accept that much.

1918
01:47:24,369 --> 01:47:27,689
Actually, by condemning those alternative point of view

1919
01:47:27,689 --> 01:47:32,829
archeologists make it much more likely that the general public will accept those alternative point of view

1920
01:47:32,829 --> 01:47:36,109
because there is a great distrust of experts in our society today

1921
01:47:36,109 --> 01:47:39,009
and behaving in a snobbish, arrogant way

1922
01:47:39,009 --> 01:47:43,889
"We archeologists are the only people who are really qualified to speak about the past

1923
01:47:43,889 --> 01:47:46,759
and anybody else who speaks about the past is dangerous

1924
01:47:46,759 --> 01:47:50,709
" that actually is not helpful to archeology in the long term.

1925
01:47:50,709 --> 01:47:54,429
Th- there could be a much more positive and a much more cooperative relationship

1926
01:47:54,429 --> 01:47:56,789
and I can see that relationship with, uh

1927
01:47:56,789 --> 01:47:58,589
with a gentleman like Ed Barnhart.

1928
01:47:58,589 --> 01:47:59,049
Mm-hmm.

1929
01:47:59,049 --> 01:48:01,629
Was very much the case with, uh

1930
01:48:01,629 --> 01:48:05,789
archeologist Martti Paasonen, uh, from the University of Helsinki

1931
01:48:05,789 --> 01:48:09,729
and with geographer Alceu Ranzi, a Brazilian geographer

1932
01:48:09,729 --> 01:48:16,129
very, very senior figure, um, who I worked with in- in the Amazon for season two of Ancient Apocalypse

1933
01:48:16,129 --> 01:48:19,769
looking at these astonishing earthworks that have emerged from the Amazon jungle

1934
01:48:19,769 --> 01:48:22,809
and which more and more are now being found with lidar.

1935
01:48:22,809 --> 01:48:25,809
Indeed, we found some of them ourselves with lidar while we were there.

1936
01:48:25,809 --> 01:48:29,969
Yeah, that was an incredible part of the show that I got a chance to preview.

1937
01:48:29,969 --> 01:48:31,529
That .

1938
01:48:31,529 --> 01:48:31,729
..

1939
01:48:31,729 --> 01:48:33,549
It's like, there's all this earthworks, yeah

1940
01:48:33,549 --> 01:48:44,109
the, uh, traces of things built on the ground that probably you can only really appreciate when you look from up above.

1941
01:48:44,109 --> 01:48:44,509
That's right.

1942
01:48:44,509 --> 01:48:55,229
So the idea that they built stuff that you can only appreciate when viewed from up above means they had a very kinda deep relationship with the- the sky.

1943
01:48:55,229 --> 01:48:55,969
With the sky.

1944
01:48:55,969 --> 01:48:56,189
Yeah.

1945
01:48:56,189 --> 01:48:58,629
And- and- and- and a very good knowledge of geometry as well

1946
01:48:58,629 --> 01:49:00,169
because these are geometrical structures.

1947
01:49:00,169 --> 01:49:04,389
And some of them even- even seem to incorporate geometrical games

1948
01:49:04,389 --> 01:49:06,429
almost of the kind, like squaring the circle.

1949
01:49:06,429 --> 01:49:06,729
Mm-hmm.

1950
01:49:06,729 --> 01:49:13,729
Uh, it's not quite that, but you have a lovely square earthwork with a lovely circle earthwork right in the middle of it.

1951
01:49:13,729 --> 01:49:16,589
Uh, whatever else they were, they were geometers.

1952
01:49:16,589 --> 01:49:23,009
They- they- they- they were not just builders of fantastically huge earthworks that nobody expected in the Amazon

1953
01:49:23,009 --> 01:49:27,269
uh, not just builders of cities that we now know existed in the Amazon

1954
01:49:27,269 --> 01:49:30,869
but that they were, uh, astronomers and mathematicians as well.

1955
01:49:30,869 --> 01:49:34,089
Everything we're talking about is so full of mystery

1956
01:49:34,089 --> 01:49:36,609
it's just fascinating, especially the farther back we go.

1957
01:49:36,609 --> 01:49:39,709
That's what I love about the past, is the mystery that's there

1958
01:49:39,709 --> 01:49:42,729
and that's another thing that I regret about some archeologists

1959
01:49:42,729 --> 01:49:47,909
is that their mission seems to be to drain all mystery out of the past

1960
01:49:47,909 --> 01:49:53,049
to suck it dry like some kind of vampire sucking the blood out of the past

1961
01:49:53,049 --> 01:49:55,369
and to reduce it to a series of numbers

1962
01:49:55,369 --> 01:49:59,369
uh, that, uh, that appear to be scientific.

1963
01:49:59,369 --> 01:50:01,909
I- I think that's- that's most unfortunate.

1964
01:50:01,909 --> 01:50:03,809
The past is deeply mysterious.

1965
01:50:03,809 --> 01:50:06,909
The whole- the whole story of life on Earth is deeply mysterious.

1966
01:50:06,909 --> 01:50:10,609
I- I mean, we were talking about the timeline of- of human beings

1967
01:50:10,609 --> 01:50:11,769
but you know, if you go 

1968
01:50:11,769 --> 01:50:14,229
if you go back to the formation of the Earth itself

1969
01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:21,429
if I've got the figures right, it's about four and a half billion years ago that the Earth supposedly formed.

1970
01:50:21,429 --> 01:50:25,809
It was then incredibly hot and inhospitable to life

1971
01:50:25,809 --> 01:50:28,809
uh, for the next several hundred million years

1972
01:50:28,809 --> 01:50:34,649
but it was actually Francis Crick who pointed out something odd

1973
01:50:34,649 --> 01:50:40,549
that within 100 million years of the Earth being cool enough to support life

1974
01:50:40,549 --> 01:50:44,059
there's bacterial life all over the planet.

1975
01:50:44,059 --> 01:50:44,348
..

1976
01:50:44,348 --> 01:50:48,653
. and, and Crick wrote a book called Life Itself that was published in 1981

1977
01:50:48,653 --> 01:50:55,093
and he suggested that life had been brought here by a process of panspermia.

1978
01:50:55,093 --> 01:50:57,973
Now that's, uh, an idea that's around in circulation

1979
01:50:57,973 --> 01:51:01,653
that, that comets may carry bacteria which can seed life on

1980
01:51:01,653 --> 01:51:02,233
on planets.

1981
01:51:02,233 --> 01:51:06,134
But Crick actually in Life Itself was talking about directed panspermia.

1982
01:51:06,134 --> 01:51:07,626
He envisaged, uh.

1983
01:51:07,626 --> 01:51:07,794
..

1984
01:51:07,794 --> 01:51:09,573
This is Crick, not me.

1985
01:51:09,573 --> 01:51:12,134
 He, he envisaged an alien civilization

1986
01:51:12,134 --> 01:51:15,794
uh, far away across a galaxy which faced

1987
01:51:15,794 --> 01:51:18,894
uh, extinction.

1988
01:51:18,894 --> 01:51:22,274
Perhaps a supernova was gonna go off in the neighborhood.

1989
01:51:22,274 --> 01:51:24,213
They were highly advanced.

1990
01:51:24,213 --> 01:51:29,238
Their first thought might have been, "Let's get ourselves off the planet and go and populate some other planet.

1991
01:51:29,238 --> 01:51:32,173
" But the distances of interstellar space were so great.

1992
01:51:32,173 --> 01:51:35,313
So their second thought was, "Let's preserve our DNA.

1993
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:41,413
Uh, let's, uh, put bacteria, genetically engineered bacteria

1994
01:51:41,413 --> 01:51:45,813
into cryogenic chambers and fire them off into the universe in all directions.

1995
01:51:45,813 --> 01:51:56,013
" And bottom line of Crick's theory in Life Itself is one of those cryogenic containers containing bacterial life from another solar system crashed into the early Earth

1996
01:51:56,013 --> 01:51:58,673
and that's why life began so suddenly here on Earth.

1997
01:51:58,673 --> 01:52:05,093
If we as a human civilization continue, I think that is a one way to

1998
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:07,853
uh, create backups of us- Mm-hmm.

1999
01:52:07,853 --> 01:52:07,853
.

2000
01:52:07,853 --> 01:52:07,853
.

2001
01:52:07,853 --> 01:52:12,393
elsewhere in the universe given the space, is to do a life gun and shoot it everywhere.

2002
01:52:12,393 --> 01:52:12,693
Yeah.

2003
01:52:12,693 --> 01:52:14,733
And there's just plants- Yes, yes.

2004
01:52:14,733 --> 01:52:14,739
.

2005
01:52:14,739 --> 01:52:14,753
..

2006
01:52:14,753 --> 01:52:17,514
and you kind of hope that whatever is the magic that

2007
01:52:17,514 --> 01:52:24,273
that makes up human consciousness, and if that magic was already there in the initial DNA

2008
01:52:24,273 --> 01:52:26,653
uh, of th- the bacteria.

2009
01:52:26,653 --> 01:52:27,133
Hm.

2010
01:52:27,133 --> 01:52:29,253
The potential for that magic is there.

2011
01:52:29,253 --> 01:52:30,313
The potential is there.

2012
01:52:30,313 --> 01:52:33,613
And, and evolutionary forces will, will, will work upon it and in

2013
01:52:33,613 --> 01:52:35,773
in different ways in different environments.

2014
01:52:35,773 --> 01:52:37,534
Uh, but that the potential is there.

2015
01:52:37,534 --> 01:52:38,993
Yes, it's something that we would do.

2016
01:52:38,993 --> 01:52:43,293
If we were facing a complete extinction of life on planet Earth

2017
01:52:43,293 --> 01:52:46,173
uh, a major global effort would be made

2018
01:52:46,173 --> 01:52:48,093
uh, to preserve it somehow.

2019
01:52:48,093 --> 01:52:52,333
Uh, and, and that might well include firing off cryogenic chambers

2020
01:52:52,333 --> 01:52:55,513
uh, into the universe and hoping that some of them would land somewhere hospitable.

2021
01:52:55,513 --> 01:53:00,293
And, uh, as you were mentioning, there's just so many interesting mysteries along the way here.

2022
01:53:00,293 --> 01:53:07,073
For example, I mean it's like, I think like three billion years it was single-cell organisms.

2023
01:53:07,073 --> 01:53:07,413
Yeah.

2024
01:53:07,413 --> 01:53:10,933
So it seems like life was pretty good- Yeah.

2025
01:53:10,933 --> 01:53:10,939
.

2026
01:53:10,939 --> 01:53:10,953
..

2027
01:53:10,953 --> 01:53:14,893
for single-cell organisms, that there was no need for multicellularity

2028
01:53:14,893 --> 01:53:15,253
that like- Mm-hmm.

2029
01:53:15,253 --> 01:53:15,266
.

2030
01:53:15,266 --> 01:53:15,293
..

2031
01:53:15,293 --> 01:53:16,933
for animals, for any of this kind of stuff.

2032
01:53:16,933 --> 01:53:19,213
So why is that?

2033
01:53:19,213 --> 01:53:23,213
It seems like you could adapt much better if you're a more complicated organism.

2034
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:25,113
It took a really long time to take that leap.

2035
01:53:25,113 --> 01:53:27,553
Is it because it's really hard to do?

2036
01:53:27,553 --> 01:53:33,333
And what was the, uh, uh, what was the forcing function to do that kind of leap?

2037
01:53:33,333 --> 01:53:33,513
Mm-hmm.

2038
01:53:33,513 --> 01:53:33,673
Mm-hmm.

2039
01:53:33,673 --> 01:53:37,053
And the same, I mean, for us to be selfish and self-obsessed

2040
01:53:37,053 --> 01:53:44,153
for us humans, like what was the magic leap to homo sapiens from the other hominids?

2041
01:53:44,153 --> 01:53:44,733
Hm.

2042
01:53:44,733 --> 01:53:48,993
And why did homo sapiens win out against Neanderthals and the other competitors?

2043
01:53:48,993 --> 01:53:52,053
Why are they not around, uh, anymore?

2044
01:53:52,053 --> 01:54:01,913
So those are all fascinating mysteries, and it feels like the more we propose sort of radical ideas about our past- Mm.

2045
01:54:01,913 --> 01:54:01,913
.

2046
01:54:01,913 --> 01:54:01,913
.

2047
01:54:01,913 --> 01:54:04,673
and take it seriously and explore, uh

2048
01:54:04,673 --> 01:54:05,993
the more we'll be able to sort of

2049
01:54:05,993 --> 01:54:13,553
uh, figure out that puzzle that g- leads all the way back to homo sapiens and maybe all the way back to the origin of life on Earth.

2050
01:54:13,553 --> 01:54:14,253
Yeah, yeah.

2051
01:54:14,253 --> 01:54:17,933
I think that homo sapiens is the tail end of a very long

2052
01:54:17,933 --> 01:54:23,333
deep series of mysteries that goes back right to the beginning of life on this planet and

2053
01:54:23,333 --> 01:54:27,653
and probably long before actually, because this planet is part of the universe

2054
01:54:27,653 --> 01:54:29,853
and God knows what else is out there in the

2055
01:54:29,853 --> 01:54:31,113
in, in the universe.

2056
01:54:31,113 --> 01:54:34,273
Wh- why do you think homo sapiens, uh

2057
01:54:34,273 --> 01:54:35,613
evolved?

2058
01:54:35,613 --> 01:54:37,853
What, like what, what was the magic thing?

2059
01:54:37,853 --> 01:54:41,393
There's a bunch of theories about fire leading to meat

2060
01:54:41,393 --> 01:54:43,953
to cooking, which can fuel the brain.

2061
01:54:43,953 --> 01:54:44,573
That's one.

2062
01:54:44,573 --> 01:54:46,753
The other is like social interaction.

2063
01:54:46,753 --> 01:54:52,153
We're able to use our imagination to construct ideas and share those ideas and tell great stories

2064
01:54:52,153 --> 01:54:54,893
and that is somehow an evolutionary advantage.

2065
01:54:54,893 --> 01:54:57,841
Do you have any, like favorite  conception of.

2066
01:54:57,841 --> 01:54:57,993
..

2067
01:54:57,993 --> 01:54:59,793
Well, um, it's interesting.

2068
01:54:59,793 --> 01:55:06,853
There's no doubt that anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals coexisted in Europe for at least 10

2069
01:55:06,853 --> 01:55:08,493
000 years, probably more than that.

2070
01:55:08,493 --> 01:55:14,653
And yet one of the, the popular views is that anatomically modern humans wiped out the Neanderthals

2071
01:55:14,653 --> 01:55:16,173
that we, we killed them off.

2072
01:55:16,173 --> 01:55:20,513
Um, but at the same time, we were interbreeding with the Neanderthals.

2073
01:55:20,513 --> 01:55:22,913
In a sense, the Neanderthals are not gone.

2074
01:55:22,913 --> 01:55:24,453
They're, they're still- Mm-hmm.

2075
01:55:24,453 --> 01:55:24,473
.

2076
01:55:24,473 --> 01:55:24,513
..

2077
01:55:24,513 --> 01:55:25,373
within us today.

2078
01:55:25,373 --> 01:55:27,873
We are part, part, part Neanderthal.

2079
01:55:27,873 --> 01:55:31,013
There's another theory that I've read about w- There

2080
01:55:31,013 --> 01:55:34,153
there is some evidence that Neanderthals were cannibals

2081
01:55:34,153 --> 01:55:37,553
that there was r- ritual cannibalism took place amongst Neanderthals

2082
01:55:37,553 --> 01:55:40,533
and particularly the eating of human brains.

2083
01:55:40,533 --> 01:55:43,053
Uh, and this, uh, can cause

2084
01:55:43,053 --> 01:55:46,913
uh, kuru, uh, which can kill off whole populations.

2085
01:55:46,913 --> 01:55:50,253
That's o- another suggestion of why the Neanderthals died out.

2086
01:55:50,253 --> 01:55:53,233
There's lots of possibilities that have been put forward.

2087
01:55:53,233 --> 01:55:55,373
Maybe we just out-competed them, you know?

2088
01:55:55,373 --> 01:56:00,533
Maybe, maybe anatomically modern humans had some brain connections that they didn't have.

2089
01:56:00,533 --> 01:56:05,373
Even though the Neanderthal brain was bigger than the brain of anatomically modern human beings

2090
01:56:05,373 --> 01:56:08,104
as the old saying goes, "Size isn't everything.

2091
01:56:08,104 --> 01:56:10,793
" Uh, maybe we just had a more compact

2092
01:56:10,793 --> 01:56:11,933
more efficient brain.

2093
01:56:11,933 --> 01:56:14,153
The fact of the matter is, uh

2094
01:56:14,153 --> 01:56:21,173
that, uh, Neanderthals and Denisovans did not survive the rise of homo sapiens.

2095
01:56:21,173 --> 01:56:25,853
For our discussion though, what is interesting is all the hominids seem to be explorers.

2096
01:56:25,853 --> 01:56:26,413
Yes.

2097
01:56:26,413 --> 01:56:27,353
They spread.

2098
01:56:27,353 --> 01:56:28,993
I mean, I didn't know this fact.

2099
01:56:28,993 --> 01:56:32,653
The, the fact that homo erectus was all over the planet more than a million years ago

2100
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:34,793
uh, is testament to that.

2101
01:56:34,793 --> 01:56:38,293
Uh, and I, I do think that exploration urge is

2102
01:56:38,293 --> 01:56:39,933
is fundamental to humanity.

2103
01:56:39,933 --> 01:56:44,093
And I, I would like to say that's what I think I'm doing.

2104
01:56:44,093 --> 01:56:48,393
I'm, I'm exercising my urge to explore the past in

2105
01:56:48,393 --> 01:56:51,333
in my own way, making my own path and defining

2106
01:56:51,333 --> 01:56:52,413
defining my own route.

2107
01:56:52,413 --> 01:56:57,177
IThat's the leap from non-human to human.

2108
01:56:57,177 --> 01:57:05,077
Uh, one of the things you've discussed is your idea of what was the leap to human civilization!

2109
01:57:05,077 --> 01:57:06,978
What is the driver?

2110
01:57:06,978 --> 01:57:10,237
What is the inspiration for humans to form civilizations?

2111
01:57:10,237 --> 01:57:12,017
And for you, that's shamanism.

2112
01:57:12,017 --> 01:57:12,937
Definitely.

2113
01:57:12,937 --> 01:57:14,058
Can you explain what that means?

2114
01:57:14,058 --> 01:57:19,957
I think that, um, shamanism is the origin of- of- of everything of value

2115
01:57:19,957 --> 01:57:22,297
uh, in humanity.

2116
01:57:22,297 --> 01:57:25,517
Uh, I think it was the earliest form of science.

2117
01:57:25,517 --> 01:57:30,157
When I spend time with, uh, shamans in the Amazon

2118
01:57:30,157 --> 01:57:36,637
I observe people who are constantly experimenting with plants in a very scientific way.

2119
01:57:36,637 --> 01:57:41,257
Uh, they're always trying a pinch of this and a pinch of that in different forms

2120
01:57:41,257 --> 01:57:47,297
for example, of the ayahuasca brew, to see if it enhances it or makes it- makes it different in- in- in any way.

2121
01:57:47,297 --> 01:57:55,957
Uh, the invention of curare is a remarkable scientific feat which is entirely down to shamans in the- in the Amazon.

2122
01:57:55,957 --> 01:57:59,657
They are the- the scientists of the hunter-for- forager

2123
01:57:59,657 --> 01:58:02,197
uh, state of society.

2124
01:58:02,197 --> 01:58:06,717
Um, and they were the ancient, um

2125
01:58:06,717 --> 01:58:09,477
leaders of human civilization.

2126
01:58:09,477 --> 01:58:13,117
So I think all- all civilization arises out of shamanism.

2127
01:58:13,117 --> 01:58:18,557
Uh, and shamanism is a naturally scientific endeavor where experimentation is undertaken

2128
01:58:18,557 --> 01:58:22,077
an exploration, an investigation of the environment around us.

2129
01:58:22,077 --> 01:58:25,117
And what I'm suggesting is that- that one group

2130
01:58:25,117 --> 01:58:39,977
perhaps more than one group, uh, went a bit further than other groups did and- and used that study of the skies and developed navigational techniques and- and were able to sail and explore the Earth.

2131
01:58:39,977 --> 01:58:48,717
Uh, but that ultimately what lies behind it is the same curiosity and investigative skill that shamans are still using

2132
01:58:48,717 --> 01:58:50,657
uh, in the Amazon to this day.

2133
01:58:50,657 --> 01:58:54,517
Uh, and- and, uh, I do see them as- as scientists

2134
01:58:54,517 --> 01:58:56,757
in a very proper use of the word.

2135
01:58:56,757 --> 01:59:00,497
But do you think something like ayahuasca was a part of that process?

2136
01:59:00,497 --> 01:59:01,317
Yes.

2137
01:59:01,317 --> 01:59:08,677
Ayahuasca is the result of shamanistic investigation of what's available in the Amazon.

2138
01:59:08,677 --> 01:59:19,737
Uh, of course, ayahuasca is all the fad in Western industrialized societies today and- and some people see it as a miracle cure for all kind of ailments and problems.

2139
01:59:19,737 --> 01:59:21,577
And perhaps it is, perhaps it can be

2140
01:59:21,577 --> 01:59:23,657
uh, in- in certain ways.

2141
01:59:23,657 --> 01:59:26,977
Ayahuasca itself is not an Amazonian word.

2142
01:59:26,977 --> 01:59:32,177
It- it comes from the Quechua language and it means "the vine of souls" or "the vine of the dead".

2143
01:59:32,177 --> 01:59:39,137
Uh, but the ayahuasca vine is only one of two principal ingredients in the ayahuasca brew

2144
01:59:39,137 --> 01:59:43,797
and the other ingredient are leaves that contain dimethyltryptamine

2145
01:59:43,797 --> 01:59:45,897
and there are two sources of that.

2146
01:59:45,897 --> 01:59:50,417
One is a bush called Psychotria viridis, that's its botanical name

2147
01:59:50,417 --> 01:59:55,637
they call it chakruna in the Amazon, and its leaves are rich in dimethyltryptamine

2148
01:59:55,637 --> 01:59:58,937
DMT, which is arguably the most powerful psychedelic

2149
01:59:58,937 --> 02:00:00,537
uh, known to science.

2150
02:00:00,537 --> 02:00:05,737
Um, and- and, uh, the other source comes from another vine

2151
02:00:05,737 --> 02:00:12,017
Diplopterys cabrerana, uh, which the leaves of that vine also contain DMT.

2152
02:00:12,017 --> 02:00:17,317
So the ayahuasca vine on its own is not going to give you a visionary journey

2153
02:00:17,317 --> 02:00:21,057
and the leaves that contain DMT on their own

2154
02:00:21,057 --> 02:00:26,457
whether they come from Diplopterys or whether they come from chakruna are not gonna give you a visionary journey.

2155
02:00:26,457 --> 02:00:36,197
And the reason they're not gonna give you the visionary journey is because of the enzyme monoamine oxidase in the gut that shuts down DMT when absorbed orally.

2156
02:00:36,197 --> 02:00:44,157
Basically, DMT is not accessible orally unless you combine it with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

2157
02:00:44,157 --> 02:00:46,577
And that's what I mean when I'm talking about science in the Amazon

2158
02:00:46,577 --> 02:00:51,597
because there's so many tens of thousands, hundred th- thousands different species of plants and trees in the Amazon

2159
02:00:51,597 --> 02:00:59,057
and they've gone around and they found just two or three of them that put together can produce these extraordinary visionary experiences.

2160
02:00:59,057 --> 02:01:01,377
Just imagine the number of plants they had to have eaten.

2161
02:01:01,377 --> 02:01:01,937
Yeah.

2162
02:01:01,937 --> 02:01:07,337
And consumed and smoked, or used all kinds of combinations to arrive at that.

2163
02:01:07,337 --> 02:01:08,477
Exactly, exactly.

2164
02:01:08,477 --> 02:01:11,437
To realize that this is something- this is something very special

2165
02:01:11,437 --> 02:01:16,537
and then- and then to use the principles there to- to find another form of it.

2166
02:01:16,537 --> 02:01:22,557
So ayahuasca is the form that is made with the ayahuasca vine and the leaves of the chakruna plant.

2167
02:01:22,557 --> 02:01:28,497
Uh, but Yage, uh, is made from the ayahuasca vine and the leaves of another vine

2168
02:01:28,497 --> 02:01:32,817
D- Diplopterys cabrerana, uh, which contain not only N

2169
02:01:32,817 --> 02:01:37,277
N-DMT, which is the DMT that everybody's pretty much familiar with these days

2170
02:01:37,277 --> 02:01:39,257
but also 5-MeO-DMT.

2171
02:01:39,257 --> 02:01:43,577
Uh, and the Yage experience which I have- I have also had

2172
02:01:43,577 --> 02:01:46,897
uh, in my view is more intense

2173
02:01:46,897 --> 02:01:50,937
uh, and more powerful almost to the point of being overwhelming

2174
02:01:50,937 --> 02:01:53,977
uh, than the- than the ayahuasca experience.

2175
02:01:53,977 --> 02:01:55,957
But- but what the- the result of this

2176
02:01:55,957 --> 02:02:00,057
uh, sophisticated chemistry that we find taking place here

2177
02:02:00,057 --> 02:02:05,657
uh, is- is, uh, a brew which is hideous to drink.

2178
02:02:05,657 --> 02:02:06,513
It- it.

2179
02:02:06,513 --> 02:02:06,697
..

2180
02:02:06,697 --> 02:02:09,477
The taste, ugh, I find it quite repulsive.

2181
02:02:09,477 --> 02:02:14,597
Um, I almost retch just to, just smelling it in the- in the cup.

2182
02:02:14,597 --> 02:02:14,977
Mm-hmm.

2183
02:02:14,977 --> 02:02:19,817
Um, but then unleashes these extraordinary experiences.

2184
02:02:19,817 --> 02:02:27,837
And it isn't just pretty visuals, it's the sense of encounters with sentient others

2185
02:02:27,837 --> 02:02:35,517
that there are sentient beings, that somehow we're surrounded by a realm of sentience that is not normally accessible to us.

2186
02:02:35,517 --> 02:02:43,217
And that the, what the ayahuasca brew and certain other psychedelics like- like psy- some psilocybin mushrooms in a high enough dose can do it as well

2187
02:02:43,217 --> 02:02:53,357
LSD can do it, but ayahuasca is the master in this of- of lowering the veil to what appears to be a seamlessly convincing other realm

2188
02:02:53,357 --> 02:02:54,177
other world.

2189
02:02:54,177 --> 02:02:57,177
And of course, the hard-line rational scientists will say

2190
02:02:57,177 --> 02:02:59,959
"That's just all fantasies of your brain.

2191
02:02:59,959 --> 02:03:07,210
" Um, but-I don't think we fully understand or even close to understanding exactly what consciousness is.

2192
02:03:07,210 --> 02:03:13,489
And I remain open to two possibilities, that consciousness is generated by the brain

2193
02:03:13,489 --> 02:03:16,789
is made by the brain in the way that a factory makes cars

2194
02:03:16,789 --> 02:03:25,429
uh, but I also am open to the possibility that the brain is a receiver of consciousness just as a television set is the receiver of television signals.

2195
02:03:25,429 --> 02:03:30,709
Um, and- and, um, that if that i- if that is the case

2196
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:46,829
then we locked into the physical realm, we need our everyday alert problem-solving state of consciousness and that's the state of consciousness that Western civilization values and- and- and- and- and highly encourages.

2197
02:03:46,829 --> 02:03:57,469
Uh, but these other states of consciousness that allow us to access alternative realities are possibly more important.

2198
02:03:57,469 --> 02:04:01,729
It may be apocryphal, uh, but it was reported

2199
02:04:01,729 --> 02:04:10,729
uh, after Francis Crick's role and his Nobel Prize for the discovery of the double helix that he finally got it under the influence of LSD.

2200
02:04:10,729 --> 02:04:14,809
There's the classic example of Kary Mullis and the polymerase chain reaction

2201
02:04:14,809 --> 02:04:18,249
he said he got that under the influence of LSD.

2202
02:04:18,249 --> 02:04:29,809
So the notion that the alert problem-solving state of consciousness is the only valuable state of consciousness is disproved by a- a- ex- valuable experiences that people have had in- in a visionary state.

2203
02:04:29,809 --> 02:04:37,042
Um, but the question that remains unresolved is those entities that we encounter in the.

2204
02:04:37,042 --> 02:04:37,109
..

2205
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:41,429
and not everybody encounters them and you're certainly not gonna encounter them on every ayahuasca trip.

2206
02:04:41,429 --> 02:04:44,469
There are ayahuasca journeys where nothing seems to happen.

2207
02:04:44,469 --> 02:04:49,789
Um, I suspect something does happen, but it happens at a subconscious level.

2208
02:04:49,789 --> 02:04:58,749
I know that shamans in the Amazon regard those trips where actually you don't see visions as amongst the most valuable and they say you are learning stuff that you're not remembering

2209
02:04:58,749 --> 02:05:00,729
but you're learning it, you're learning it anyway.

2210
02:05:00,729 --> 02:05:04,409
Um, these sentient others that are encountered

2211
02:05:04,409 --> 02:05:06,549
what are they, you know?

2212
02:05:06,549 --> 02:05:13,219
Are they just figments of our brain on drugs or are we actually gaining access to a parallel reality where.

2213
02:05:13,219 --> 02:05:13,309
..

2214
02:05:13,309 --> 02:05:17,689
which is inhabited by consciousness which is in non- a non-physical form?

2215
02:05:17,689 --> 02:05:21,549
Uh, and- and I'm equally open to that idea.

2216
02:05:21,549 --> 02:05:25,469
I think that may be, may be what is going on here with- with ayahuasca.

2217
02:05:25,469 --> 02:05:36,949
But the other thing is that there is a presence within the ayahuasca brew and she is present bo- present both in ayahuasca and in yage.

2218
02:05:36,949 --> 02:05:43,629
And that's one of the reasons why the shamans say that- that actually the master of the process is the ayahuasca vine

2219
02:05:43,629 --> 02:05:44,709
not the leaves.

2220
02:05:44,709 --> 02:05:49,069
It's as though the vine has harnessed the leaves to gain access to human consciousness.

2221
02:05:49,069 --> 02:05:54,349
And there if you have sufficient exposure to ayahuasca or yage

2222
02:05:54,349 --> 02:05:59,909
you drink it enough times, I've had maybe 75 or 80 journeys with- with ayahuasca

2223
02:05:59,909 --> 02:06:14,409
uh, you s- you definitely start to feel an intelligent presence with a definite personality which I interpret as feminine and which most people in The West interpreted as feminine and they call her Mother Ayahuasca.

2224
02:06:14,409 --> 02:06:18,169
There are some tribes in the Amazon who interpret the spirit of ayahuasca as male

2225
02:06:18,169 --> 02:06:22,609
uh, but in all cases, that spirit is seen as a teacher.

2226
02:06:22,609 --> 02:06:28,509
Uh, that's fundamentally what ayahuasca is, it's a teacher and it teaches moral lessons.

2227
02:06:28,509 --> 02:06:43,469
And that's fascinating that a mixture of two plants should cause us to reflect on our own behavior and how it may have hurt and damaged and affected others and fill us with a- a powerful wish not to repeat that negative behavior again in the future.

2228
02:06:43,469 --> 02:06:47,189
Uh, y- the more baggage you carry in your life

2229
02:06:47,189 --> 02:06:56,229
the harder the beating the ayahuasca is going to give you until it forces you to confront and take responsibility for your own behavior.

2230
02:06:56,229 --> 02:07:00,109
Uh, and- and that is a, that is an extraordinary thing to come from a

2231
02:07:00,109 --> 02:07:02,569
from a pl- a plant brew in that way.

2232
02:07:02,569 --> 02:07:04,729
And I think in- in yes, the.

2233
02:07:04,729 --> 02:07:04,869
..

2234
02:07:04,869 --> 02:07:09,489
I- I think ayahuasca is the most powerful of all the plant medicines

2235
02:07:09,489 --> 02:07:14,800
uh, for accessing these mysterious realms, but there's no doubt you can access them.

2236
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:14,909
..

2237
02:07:14,909 --> 02:07:18,149
they're- they're all tryptamines, they're all related to one another in- in one way.

2238
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:24,589
You can access them through LSD and you certainly can access them through psilocybin mushrooms as well in large enough dose.

2239
02:07:24,589 --> 02:07:27,529
Both possibilities, as you describe, are interesting

2240
02:07:27,529 --> 02:07:30,269
and to me they're kind of akin to each other.

2241
02:07:30,269 --> 02:07:40,449
Uh, just I wonder what the- the limit of the brain's capacity is to create imaginary worlds and treat them seriously

2242
02:07:40,449 --> 02:07:50,409
make them real, and in those worlds explore and have real sort of moral deep brainstorming sessions- Mm.

2243
02:07:50,409 --> 02:07:50,509
.

2244
02:07:50,509 --> 02:07:50,709
..

2245
02:07:50,709 --> 02:07:53,429
uh, with those entities.

2246
02:07:53,429 --> 02:08:00,589
It's almost like the power of the human mind to imagine taken to its limit.

2247
02:08:00,589 --> 02:08:01,009
Mm.

2248
02:08:01,009 --> 02:08:01,629
It is.

2249
02:08:01,629 --> 02:08:06,260
Um, and the curious thing is that the same iconography.

2250
02:08:06,260 --> 02:08:06,409
..

2251
02:08:06,409 --> 02:08:09,489
people paint their visions after ayahuasca sessions.

2252
02:08:09,489 --> 02:08:14,289
People were painting in Europe in the Cave of Lascaux

2253
02:08:14,289 --> 02:08:17,389
for example, and of course, they had access to psilocybin mushrooms

2254
02:08:17,389 --> 02:08:20,229
uh, in prehistoric Europe.

2255
02:08:20,229 --> 02:08:24,929
Uh, there's a remarkable commonality in the imagery that is

2256
02:08:24,929 --> 02:08:25,669
that is painted.

2257
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:30,849
I- I, uh, I like to give credit where credit is due and there are two names that need to be mentioned here.

2258
02:08:30,849 --> 02:08:42,409
One is the late great Terence McKenna and his book Food of the Gods where he proposed the idea very strongly that it was our ancestral encounters with psychedelics that made us fully human.

2259
02:08:42,409 --> 02:08:46,229
That's- that's what switched on the modern human mind.

2260
02:08:46,229 --> 02:08:54,409
And very much the same idea began to be explored a bit earlier by Professor David Lewis-Williams at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa.

2261
02:08:54,409 --> 02:08:56,989
Fabulous book called The Mind in the Cave

2262
02:08:56,989 --> 02:09:13,302
uh, where- where he is again arguing that these astonishing similarities in- in cave art and rock art all around the world can only be properly explained by people in deeply altered states of consciousness attempting to remember-.

2263
02:09:13,302 --> 02:09:13,497
..

2264
02:09:13,497 --> 02:09:16,137
when they return to a normal everyday state of consciousness

2265
02:09:16,137 --> 02:09:19,737
intem- attempting to remember their visions and document them

2266
02:09:19,737 --> 02:09:22,837
uh, on permanent media like the, like the wall of a cave.

2267
02:09:22,837 --> 02:09:25,497
So typically, you get a lot of geometric patterns

2268
02:09:25,497 --> 02:09:30,477
but you also got entities, and those entities often are therianthropes

2269
02:09:30,477 --> 02:09:34,117
part animal, part human in form.

2270
02:09:34,117 --> 02:09:37,357
Might have the head of a wolf and the body of a human being

2271
02:09:37,357 --> 02:09:41,997
uh, might have the head of a bird and the body of a human being and so on and so forth.

2272
02:09:41,997 --> 02:09:45,197
And that they communicate with us in the visionary state.

2273
02:09:45,197 --> 02:09:53,778
Interestingly, although this sounds like woo-woo, and it is an area that most scientists would steer clear of at risk of their careers

2274
02:09:53,778 --> 02:10:06,357
there is very serious work now being done at Imperial College in London and at the University of California at San Diego where volunteers are being given extended DMT.

2275
02:10:06,357 --> 02:10:10,217
There's a new technology, uh, DMTX, uh

2276
02:10:10,217 --> 02:10:14,297
where the DMT is fed directly into the bloodstream by drip

2277
02:10:14,297 --> 02:10:18,937
and it's possible to keep the individual in the peak DMT state

2278
02:10:18,937 --> 02:10:21,717
uh, which normally when you smoke or vape DMT

2279
02:10:21,717 --> 02:10:24,217
you're looking, if you're lucky, at 10 minutes

2280
02:10:24,217 --> 02:10:27,617
or if you're unlucky, if it's a bad journey

2281
02:10:27,617 --> 02:10:29,737
because those 10 minutes can seem like forever.

2282
02:10:29,737 --> 02:10:36,217
Um, but, uh, with DMTX, with the drip feeding of DMT into the bloodstream

2283
02:10:36,217 --> 02:10:38,937
these volunteers actually could be kept in the peak state

2284
02:10:38,937 --> 02:10:40,077
uh, for hours.

2285
02:10:40,077 --> 02:10:43,458
And unlike LSD where you rapidly build up tolerance

2286
02:10:43,458 --> 02:10:45,817
nobody ever builds up tolerance to DMT.

2287
02:10:45,817 --> 02:10:47,477
It always hits you with the same power.

2288
02:10:47,477 --> 02:10:51,138
Even if you took it yesterday and the day before and you're taking it tomorrow as well

2289
02:10:51,138 --> 02:10:52,977
it's still gonna have that same power.

2290
02:10:52,977 --> 02:10:54,038
There's no tolerance there.

2291
02:10:54,038 --> 02:10:57,618
So that's how they can, they can use that lack of tolerance to

2292
02:10:57,618 --> 02:10:59,897
to keep volunteers in this state.

2293
02:10:59,897 --> 02:11:05,478
And then when they debrief those volunteers, they're also putting them in MRI scanners and looking at what's happening in the brain.

2294
02:11:05,478 --> 02:11:10,937
But when they debrief them, they're all talking about encounters with sentient others.

2295
02:11:10,937 --> 02:11:14,367
There's even a group now called Sentient Others where people are exchanging.

2296
02:11:14,367 --> 02:11:14,457
..

2297
02:11:14,457 --> 02:11:17,257
Volunteers are, are now exchanging their experiences.

2298
02:11:17,257 --> 02:11:20,057
They didn't do s- they weren't allowed to do so at the beginning of the experiment

2299
02:11:20,057 --> 02:11:21,877
but now that most of them have left it

2300
02:11:21,877 --> 02:11:28,497
they're exchanging their experiences and it's all about encounters with insentient others who wish to teach them moral lessons.

2301
02:11:28,497 --> 02:11:31,097
Now, uh, to me that's wild.

2302
02:11:31,097 --> 02:11:32,677
What, what is going on here?

2303
02:11:32,677 --> 02:11:34,497
Uh, what, w- what, what, what

2304
02:11:34,497 --> 02:11:34,842
what.

2305
02:11:34,842 --> 02:11:34,957
..

2306
02:11:34,957 --> 02:11:36,537
how do we account for this?

2307
02:11:36,537 --> 02:11:40,517
Yeah, I get the notion of hallucinations and brightly colored visuals

2308
02:11:40,517 --> 02:11:42,377
but the moral lessons that come with it

2309
02:11:42,377 --> 02:11:43,437
tho- those are very odd.

2310
02:11:43,437 --> 02:11:48,837
Yeah, and would you say that the reason that could give birth to a civilization

2311
02:11:48,837 --> 02:12:02,497
is it because th- such visions can help create myths and especially like religious myths that would be a cohesive thing for a large group of people to get around?

2312
02:12:02,497 --> 02:12:05,057
Yes, yeah, and can help us to be better members of our own community.

2313
02:12:05,057 --> 02:12:06,337
Right, with the moral lessons.

2314
02:12:06,337 --> 02:12:09,297
Yeah, more contributing members of our community

2315
02:12:09,297 --> 02:12:12,097
uh, more caring, more nurturing members of our community.

2316
02:12:12,097 --> 02:12:13,477
That's got to be good for, for

2317
02:12:13,477 --> 02:12:14,497
for any community.

2318
02:12:14,497 --> 02:12:17,677
I'm, I'm on, I've said this a dozen times but uh

2319
02:12:17,677 --> 02:12:19,017
uh, I'll say it again.

2320
02:12:19,017 --> 02:12:21,237
If, if I had the power to do so

2321
02:12:21,237 --> 02:12:26,077
I would make it a law, an absolute law

2322
02:12:26,077 --> 02:12:29,877
that anybody running for a powerful political position

2323
02:12:29,877 --> 02:12:33,997
particularly if that position is president or head of state in any kind of way

2324
02:12:33,997 --> 02:12:37,617
that that person has to undergo the ayahuasca ordeal first.

2325
02:12:37,617 --> 02:12:41,497
They have to have 10 or 12 sessions of ayahuasca

2326
02:12:41,497 --> 02:12:45,217
uh, as a condition for applying for the job.

2327
02:12:45,217 --> 02:12:53,257
Uh, I suspect that most who had had those experiences wouldn't want to apply for the job anymore.

2328
02:12:53,257 --> 02:12:55,477
They would want to live a different kind of life.

2329
02:12:55,477 --> 02:13:06,457
And those who did want to carry on being a leader of a nation would be very different people from the people who are leading the nations of the earth into chaos and destruction today.

2330
02:13:06,457 --> 02:13:08,797
Yeah, they would be doing it for the right reasons.

2331
02:13:08,797 --> 02:13:13,117
I mentioned to you, I recently interviewed Donald Trump and actually brought up this same

2332
02:13:13,117 --> 02:13:19,417
uh, same idea that, uh, it would be a much better world if most of Congress and most p- politicians would take some form of psychedelic- Yeah.

2333
02:13:19,417 --> 02:13:19,423
.

2334
02:13:19,423 --> 02:13:19,437
..

2335
02:13:19,437 --> 02:13:20,177
at the very least.

2336
02:13:20,177 --> 02:13:22,857
I have no doubt that it would be a better world .

2337
02:13:22,857 --> 02:13:24,677
I mean, this raises an interesting point

2338
02:13:24,677 --> 02:13:29,097
which is the role of government in controlling our consciousness.

2339
02:13:29,097 --> 02:13:33,157
Uh, and in my opinion, the, the

2340
02:13:33,157 --> 02:13:39,977
the so-called war on drugs is one of the fundamental abuses of human rights that have been undertaken in the past

2341
02:13:39,977 --> 02:13:41,457
in the past 60 years.

2342
02:13:41,457 --> 02:13:43,737
Uh, it should be a Republican issue.

2343
02:13:43,737 --> 02:13:51,057
If I understand the Republican Party correctly, the Republican Party believes in individual freedom for adults as much as possible

2344
02:13:51,057 --> 02:13:55,237
uh, and particularly the freedom to make choices over their own bodies.

2345
02:13:55,237 --> 02:13:58,897
Uh, but in the case of even cannabis

2346
02:13:58,897 --> 02:14:02,137
I know, th- it's one of the great things that's happening in America

2347
02:14:02,137 --> 02:14:05,977
it's, it's happening state by state where cannabis is being

2348
02:14:05,977 --> 02:14:11,177
is being legalized and that draconian hand of government is being taken off the back of people who are

2349
02:14:11,177 --> 02:14:15,237
who are consuming a medicine that is far less harmful than alcohol

2350
02:14:15,237 --> 02:14:18,397
which is glorified, uh, in, in our society.

2351
02:14:18,397 --> 02:14:30,877
Um, we cannot say that we are free if we allow a government to dictate to us what experiences we may or may not have in our inner consciousness while doing no harm to others.

2352
02:14:30,877 --> 02:14:37,497
And the point there is, we already have a whole raft of laws that deal with us when we do harm to others.

2353
02:14:37,497 --> 02:14:41,077
Do we really need laws that tell us what we may and may

2354
02:14:41,077 --> 02:14:44,217
or may not experience in the inner sanctum of our own consciousness?

2355
02:14:44,217 --> 02:14:48,037
I think it's a fundamental violation of adult sovereignty.

2356
02:14:48,037 --> 02:14:58,857
Uh, and we would have much less drug problems if these drugs were all legalized and made available to people without shaming them

2357
02:14:58,857 --> 02:15:02,037
without, without punishing them in any way

2358
02:15:02,037 --> 02:15:03,897
but just part of normal social life.

2359
02:15:03,897 --> 02:15:10,357
And then you could be sure that you were getting good product rather than really shitty product which has been cut with all sorts of other things.

2360
02:15:10,357 --> 02:15:24,697
Ultimately, the way forward is for adults to take responsibility for their own behavior and for society to allow that to happen and not to have big government taking responsibility for decisions that should be in the hands of individuals.

2361
02:15:24,697 --> 02:15:27,177
And for me also it's exciting, some of these

2362
02:15:27,177 --> 02:15:29,857
uh, substances like psilocybin are, are, uh

2363
02:15:29,857 --> 02:15:32,605
being integrated to s- scientific studies at larger scales.

2364
02:15:32,605 --> 02:15:33,545
That's really interesting.

2365
02:15:33,545 --> 02:15:37,825
We've seen a revolution in, in the way science looks at psychedelics in the last 20

2366
02:15:37,825 --> 02:15:38,885
25 years.

2367
02:15:38,885 --> 02:15:42,825
Um, they, they were in that highly demonized category.

2368
02:15:42,825 --> 02:15:47,065
But again, it's one of those paradigms which gets overwhelmed by new evidence

2369
02:15:47,065 --> 02:15:49,265
and it began  to be realized that

2370
02:15:49,265 --> 02:15:56,205
that, uh, psilocybin and, and other psychedelics are very helpful in a range of conditions from which people

2371
02:15:56,205 --> 02:15:57,146
people suffer.

2372
02:15:57,146 --> 02:15:58,905
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

2373
02:15:58,905 --> 02:16:01,345
Uh, the fear of death when you're

2374
02:16:01,345 --> 02:16:04,905
when you're suffering from terminal cancer can be overwhelming

2375
02:16:04,905 --> 02:16:06,745
and it's been found that, that, that

2376
02:16:06,745 --> 02:16:09,405
uh, psilocybin can, can remove that.

2377
02:16:09,405 --> 02:16:17,265
Uh, deep depressions can be evaporated with one single massive psilocybin journey.

2378
02:16:17,265 --> 02:16:18,185
They just go away.

2379
02:16:18,185 --> 02:16:19,445
There's really good science on this.

2380
02:16:19,445 --> 02:16:22,685
And, and they are being integrated into conventional medicine more and more.

2381
02:16:22,685 --> 02:16:23,505
We'll see it happening.

2382
02:16:23,505 --> 02:16:25,525
I'm not sure if it'll happen as much as

2383
02:16:25,525 --> 02:16:27,786
as fast as I would like to see it happen in my lifetime

2384
02:16:27,786 --> 02:16:28,765
but it is gonna happen.

2385
02:16:28,765 --> 02:16:34,684
Yeah, I actually, uh, just recently found out that you had a TED Talk

2386
02:16:34,684 --> 02:16:36,504
War on Consciousness-  Yes.

2387
02:16:36,504 --> 02:16:36,605
.

2388
02:16:36,605 --> 02:16:36,805
..

2389
02:16:36,805 --> 02:16:38,344
that, uh, was taken down.

2390
02:16:38,344 --> 02:16:38,805
Yeah.

2391
02:16:38,805 --> 02:16:40,365
And that was just part of just the

2392
02:16:40,365 --> 02:16:41,764
the general resistance.

2393
02:16:41,764 --> 02:16:42,945
'Cause it was, it was a pretty.

2394
02:16:42,945 --> 02:16:44,545
It wasn't a radical.

2395
02:16:44,545 --> 02:16:44,665
No.

2396
02:16:44,665 --> 02:16:45,965
I, I wa- It wasn't really a radical talk .

2397
02:16:45,965 --> 02:16:47,325
I was talking about ayahuasca.

2398
02:16:47,325 --> 02:16:47,344
Yeah.

2399
02:16:47,344 --> 02:16:52,465
And I was talking about the view that I hold very strongly that as long as we do no harm to others

2400
02:16:52,465 --> 02:16:57,665
sovereign adults should be allowed to make decisions about their own bodies and not face a jail sentence or

2401
02:16:57,665 --> 02:16:59,225
or shaming as a result.

2402
02:16:59,225 --> 02:16:59,830
But this.

2403
02:16:59,830 --> 02:16:59,905
..

2404
02:16:59,905 --> 02:17:02,584
So it was a TEDx Talk, not a TED Talk

2405
02:17:02,584 --> 02:17:04,905
organized by a local TED, TED group.

2406
02:17:04,905 --> 02:17:06,445
They call them TEDx Talks.

2407
02:17:06,445 --> 02:17:09,424
Um, and, uh, I, I gave this

2408
02:17:09,424 --> 02:17:12,344
I gave this talk about the war on consciousness.

2409
02:17:12,344 --> 02:17:15,665
And it was immediately pulled down from TED's main channel

2410
02:17:15,665 --> 02:17:19,885
uh, with all kinds of bizarre reasons being given.

2411
02:17:19,885 --> 02:17:26,045
But unfortunately it was too late, because a number of people had already downloaded the talk and then uploaded it onto other YouTube channels.

2412
02:17:26,045 --> 02:17:28,805
And actually, their banning of it made it go viral

2413
02:17:28,805 --> 02:17:30,745
uh, in a way that would not have

2414
02:17:30,745 --> 02:17:31,865
would not have happened otherwise.

2415
02:17:31,865 --> 02:17:37,004
But again, it's a sign that, that points of view that are not acceptable to those in positions of power

2416
02:17:37,004 --> 02:17:39,825
uh, are simply dismissed and shut down

2417
02:17:39,825 --> 02:17:42,245
uh, or at least attempts are made to

2418
02:17:42,245 --> 02:17:43,165
to do so.

2419
02:17:43,165 --> 02:17:45,684
In general, just along that line of thinking

2420
02:17:45,684 --> 02:17:50,385
I'm pretty sure that what we understand about consciousness today will seem silly

2421
02:17:50,385 --> 02:17:53,445
uh, to humans from a ho- 100 years from now.

2422
02:17:53,445 --> 02:17:54,105
You bet it will.

2423
02:17:54,105 --> 02:17:59,825
Uh, es- especially if we harness psychedelics to investigate consciousness and

2424
02:17:59,825 --> 02:18:01,225
and, uh, you know, that is

2425
02:18:01,225 --> 02:18:03,344
that is what is happening at, uh

2426
02:18:03,344 --> 02:18:07,985
at Imperial College right now, is, is the investigation of the experience.

2427
02:18:07,985 --> 02:18:08,837
They're not looking.

2428
02:18:08,837 --> 02:18:08,965
..

2429
02:18:08,965 --> 02:18:12,424
There are other trials that are looking for the therapeutic potential of DMT

2430
02:18:12,424 --> 02:18:23,885
but in this case, they're looking entirely at the experiences that people have and why they're so similar from people from different age groups and different genders and different parts of the world are all having the same experiences.

2431
02:18:23,885 --> 02:18:26,045
And for me, from an engineer perspective

2432
02:18:26,045 --> 02:18:31,184
it's interesting, if it's possible to engineer consciousness in artificial beings.

2433
02:18:31,184 --> 02:18:31,525
Yeah.

2434
02:18:31,525 --> 02:18:37,545
It's, it's, it's another way to approach the question of how special is cons- human consciousness.

2435
02:18:37,545 --> 02:18:37,785
Yeah.

2436
02:18:37,785 --> 02:18:38,278
How.

2437
02:18:38,278 --> 02:18:38,405
..

2438
02:18:38,405 --> 02:18:41,445
From where does it arise?

2439
02:18:41,445 --> 02:18:44,605
Uh, is it, is it something that permeates all of life?

2440
02:18:44,605 --> 02:18:48,184
And then in that case, what is the thing that makes life special?

2441
02:18:48,184 --> 02:18:49,225
Like, what is life?

2442
02:18:49,225 --> 02:18:52,504
What is these living organisms that we have here and

2443
02:18:52,504 --> 02:18:54,465
uh, that, that evolved to create humans

2444
02:18:54,465 --> 02:18:56,485
and what is truly special about humans?

2445
02:18:56,485 --> 02:19:02,264
And it's both s- scary and exciting to consider the possibility that we can create something like this.

2446
02:19:02,264 --> 02:19:02,584
Yeah.

2447
02:19:02,584 --> 02:19:03,584
But why not?

2448
02:19:03,584 --> 02:19:06,184
We're a vehicle for consciousness, in my view.

2449
02:19:06,184 --> 02:19:09,924
Uh, I think consciousness is present in all life on Earth.

2450
02:19:09,924 --> 02:19:12,764
Uh, I don't think it's limited t- to human beings.

2451
02:19:12,764 --> 02:19:17,445
We have the equipment to manifest and express that consciousness in the way that a dog

2452
02:19:17,445 --> 02:19:20,105
for example, doesn't have, or a snail doesn't have

2453
02:19:20,105 --> 02:19:21,365
or a pigeon doesn't have.

2454
02:19:21,365 --> 02:19:31,365
But when I look at two f- pigeons sitting on my garden fence and rubbing up close to each other and enjoying each other's company and taking off together and hanging out together

2455
02:19:31,365 --> 02:19:33,184
I think they're conscious beings.

2456
02:19:33,184 --> 02:19:37,405
Um, and, and I think, I c- I think consciousness is everywhere.

2457
02:19:37,405 --> 02:19:41,545
I think it's the basis of everything, and I suspect that fundamentally

2458
02:19:41,545 --> 02:19:51,465
consciousness is nonphysical, and that it can manifest in physical forms where it can then have experiences that would not be available in the nonphysical state.

2459
02:19:51,465 --> 02:19:52,705
That's a, that's a guess though.

2460
02:19:52,705 --> 02:19:53,945
That'd be a fascinating.

2461
02:19:53,945 --> 02:19:54,085
..

2462
02:19:54,085 --> 02:19:56,725
Because then you can construct all kinds of physical forms- Yeah.

2463
02:19:56,725 --> 02:19:56,725
.

2464
02:19:56,725 --> 02:19:56,725
.

2465
02:19:56,725 --> 02:19:57,925
to manifest the consciousness.

2466
02:19:57,925 --> 02:20:01,065
And see if consciousness enters, if they become consciousness.

2467
02:20:01,065 --> 02:20:04,625
Isn't, isn't there some suggestion that artificial intelligence is already becoming conscious?

2468
02:20:04,625 --> 02:20:06,805
That makes humans really uncomfortable.

2469
02:20:06,805 --> 02:20:07,125
Yeah.

2470
02:20:07,125 --> 02:20:09,525
Because we are at the top of the food chain.

2471
02:20:09,525 --> 02:20:14,385
We consider ourselves truly special, and to consider that there's other things that could be special- Mm-hmm.

2472
02:20:14,385 --> 02:20:14,451
.

2473
02:20:14,451 --> 02:20:14,585
..

2474
02:20:14,585 --> 02:20:16,205
is, uh, is scary.

2475
02:20:16,205 --> 02:20:19,485
Well, look how other people make us uncomfortable too.

2476
02:20:19,485 --> 02:20:21,185
I mean, look at the state of the world today.

2477
02:20:21,185 --> 02:20:23,825
Uh, all the conflicts that are, that

2478
02:20:23,825 --> 02:20:24,945
that, that are raging.

2479
02:20:24,945 --> 02:20:27,205
Uh, that's, that's because we're afraid.

2480
02:20:27,205 --> 02:20:29,625
When I say we, I'm speaking nation by nation

2481
02:20:29,625 --> 02:20:31,685
that, that, we, we are afraid of other people.

2482
02:20:31,685 --> 02:20:35,005
We fear that they're going to hurt us or damage us in some way

2483
02:20:35,005 --> 02:20:36,605
and so we seek to stop that.

2484
02:20:36,605 --> 02:20:37,845
It's the, it's the root of many

2485
02:20:37,845 --> 02:20:39,505
many conflicts, this, this fear.

2486
02:20:39,505 --> 02:20:43,405
And so fear of AI may not be such a good idea after all.

2487
02:20:43,405 --> 02:20:46,005
It might be very interesting to go down that route and see where it comes.

2488
02:20:46,005 --> 02:20:49,725
Certainly, in terms of exploring consciousness, it is very interesting.

2489
02:20:49,725 --> 02:20:50,465
Yeah.

2490
02:20:50,465 --> 02:20:52,745
Fear is a useful thing.

2491
02:20:52,745 --> 02:20:53,365
Mm-hmm.

2492
02:20:53,365 --> 02:20:54,885
But it can also be destructive.

2493
02:20:54,885 --> 02:20:58,484
Well, it can be destructive and it can shut you down completely.

2494
02:20:58,484 --> 02:21:00,337
If you look into the, into the future

2495
02:21:00,337 --> 02:21:04,957
maybe the next hundred years, what- what do you hope are the interesting discoveries in archeology that we'll

2496
02:21:04,957 --> 02:21:06,378
that we'll find?

2497
02:21:06,378 --> 02:21:09,197
Well, I'd really like to know how the Great Pyramid was built.

2498
02:21:09,197 --> 02:21:12,497
Uh, and- and we now have with new tech

2499
02:21:12,497 --> 02:21:18,977
with- with scanning technology, it's now become apparent that there are many major voids within the Great Pyramid.

2500
02:21:18,977 --> 02:21:20,897
Uh, uh, right above the Grand Gallery

2501
02:21:20,897 --> 02:21:26,277
there's, uh, what looks like a second grand gallery that has been i- identified with remote scanning.

2502
02:21:26,277 --> 02:21:29,338
Uh, and- and, um, new chambers

2503
02:21:29,338 --> 02:21:30,977
one of them has even been opened up

2504
02:21:30,977 --> 02:21:33,997
uh, already, are being found as a result of this.

2505
02:21:33,997 --> 02:21:39,337
So- so it may be that the se- that the Great Pyramid will ultimately give up its secrets.

2506
02:21:39,337 --> 02:21:43,277
I often think that the Great Pyramid is- is partly designed to do that.

2507
02:21:43,277 --> 02:21:47,217
It's designed to invite its own initiates.

2508
02:21:47,217 --> 02:21:50,098
Some people aren't interested in the Great Pyramid at all

2509
02:21:50,098 --> 02:21:53,797
uh, but some people are fascinated by it and they're drawn towards it.

2510
02:21:53,797 --> 02:21:59,377
And when they're drawn towards it, it immediately starts raising questions in their minds and they seek answers to their questions.

2511
02:21:59,377 --> 02:22:01,857
So it's like saying, "Here I stand.

2512
02:22:01,857 --> 02:22:03,617
Investigate me.

2513
02:22:03,617 --> 02:22:05,077
Find out about me.

2514
02:22:05,077 --> 02:22:06,377
Figure out what I am.

2515
02:22:06,377 --> 02:22:11,557
Why have I got these two shafts cut into the side of the so-called Queen's Chamber?

2516
02:22:11,557 --> 02:22:14,797
Why do they slope up through the body of the Great Pyramid?

2517
02:22:14,797 --> 02:22:17,497
Why do they not exit on the outside of the Great Pyramid?

2518
02:22:17,497 --> 02:22:25,117
Why when we send a robot up those shafts do we find them after about 160 feet blocked by a door with metal handles?

2519
02:22:25,117 --> 02:22:28,217
Why when we drill through that door to see what's beyond it

2520
02:22:28,217 --> 02:22:30,953
three or four feet away we see another door?

2521
02:22:30,953 --> 02:22:35,537
" Uh, it's, like, very frustrating but it's- it's saying to us

2522
02:22:35,537 --> 02:22:37,057
"Keep on exploring.

2523
02:22:37,057 --> 02:22:40,585
If you, if you're persistent enough, we'll eventually give you the answers.

2524
02:22:40,585 --> 02:22:49,757
" So I'm hoping that that answer will come as to how this most mysterious of monuments was actually built and the inspiration that lay behind it.

2525
02:22:49,757 --> 02:22:55,277
Certainly, I'm sure it was never a tomb or a tomb only.

2526
02:22:55,277 --> 02:22:58,597
Uh, the later pyramids might have been.

2527
02:22:58,597 --> 02:23:01,897
Actually, no pharaonic burial has been discovered in any pyramid.

2528
02:23:01,897 --> 02:23:07,817
But- but, uh, nevertheless, it's pretty clear that the later pyramids with the pyramid texts written on the walls

2529
02:23:07,817 --> 02:23:11,217
like the Pyramid of Unas, fifth dynasty pyramid at Saqqara

2530
02:23:11,217 --> 02:23:12,977
uh, were- were tombs.

2531
02:23:12,977 --> 02:23:15,497
Um, but- but, uh, the Great Pyramid

2532
02:23:15,497 --> 02:23:17,737
to go to that length to create a tomb

2533
02:23:17,737 --> 02:23:20,037
to make it a scale model of the Earth

2534
02:23:20,037 --> 02:23:22,517
uh, to orient it perfectly to true north

2535
02:23:22,517 --> 02:23:25,617
to make it six million tons, this is not a tomb.

2536
02:23:25,617 --> 02:23:27,037
Uh, this is something else.

2537
02:23:27,037 --> 02:23:28,597
This is a curiosity device.

2538
02:23:28,597 --> 02:23:31,077
This is something that is asking us to understand it.

2539
02:23:31,077 --> 02:23:33,617
And I hope we will understand it, and I hope

2540
02:23:33,617 --> 02:23:41,357
I hope Egyptologists will be willing to set aside that prejudice that they're only looking at a tomb and consider other possibilities.

2541
02:23:41,357 --> 02:23:46,197
And as new tech is revealing these previously unknown inner spaces within the Great Pyramid

2542
02:23:46,197 --> 02:23:47,977
I think that's gonna become more and more likely.

2543
02:23:47,977 --> 02:23:50,317
So not just the how it was built

2544
02:23:50,317 --> 02:23:50,997
but the why.

2545
02:23:50,997 --> 02:23:51,457
But the why.

2546
02:23:51,457 --> 02:23:52,177
But the why.

2547
02:23:52,177 --> 02:23:57,177
And to you it seems obvious that there would be a cosmic motivation.

2548
02:23:57,177 --> 02:23:57,717
Yeah.

2549
02:23:57,717 --> 02:23:58,797
Very, very much so.

2550
02:23:58,797 --> 02:24:00,177
As above, so below.

2551
02:24:00,177 --> 02:24:01,997
 Yeah.

2552
02:24:01,997 --> 02:24:04,717
Uh, you know, which is, which is an idea in the Hermetica.

2553
02:24:04,717 --> 02:24:09,457
Uh, the god Hermes for the Greeks was the Greek version of Thoth

2554
02:24:09,457 --> 02:24:12,537
the wisdom god of ancient Egypt, and that's where that saying comes from.

2555
02:24:12,537 --> 02:24:13,737
It comes from the Hermetica.

2556
02:24:13,737 --> 02:24:18,917
Uh, but it's expressing an ancient Egyptian idea to mirror the perfection of the heavens on Earth.

2557
02:24:18,917 --> 02:24:23,177
Do you think there's something interesting to be discovered about the how it was built?

2558
02:24:23,177 --> 02:24:27,757
I mean, beyond the sort of the- the ideas of the r- using ramps and wet sand?

2559
02:24:27,757 --> 02:24:27,997
Yeah.

2560
02:24:27,997 --> 02:24:28,997
Ramps won't do it.

2561
02:24:28,997 --> 02:24:31,157
Ramps won't do it, nor will wet sand.

2562
02:24:31,157 --> 02:24:38,137
Uh, it's true that the ancient Egyptians did haul big objects on sleds on wet sand.

2563
02:24:38,137 --> 02:24:53,697
Uh, there are even reliefs that show the process where an individual is standing on the front of the sledge pouring water down to- to lubricate the sand underneath and- and that's a perfectly respectable way to move a 200-ton block of stone

2564
02:24:53,697 --> 02:24:55,350
uh, across sand if you.

2565
02:24:55,350 --> 02:24:55,417
..

2566
02:24:55,417 --> 02:24:57,717
Flat sand, if you have enough people to pull it.

2567
02:24:57,717 --> 02:25:05,837
But th- that is not gonna help you get dozens of 70-ton granite blocks 300 feet in the air

2568
02:25:05,837 --> 02:25:13,437
uh, to form the roof of the King's Chamber and the floor of the chamber above it and the roof of that chamber and the floor of the chamber above that and so on and so forth.

2569
02:25:13,437 --> 02:25:16,277
Wet sand never got those objects up there.

2570
02:25:16,277 --> 02:25:18,017
Somehow they were lifted up there.

2571
02:25:18,017 --> 02:25:21,537
Now, uh, yeah, ramps are proposed as the solution

2572
02:25:21,537 --> 02:25:24,077
but- but where are the remains of those ramps?

2573
02:25:24,077 --> 02:25:31,657
If you're going to carry, uh, blocks weighing up to two or three tons right to the top of the Great Pyramid to complete your work

2574
02:25:31,657 --> 02:25:38,597
you're gonna need a ramp that's going to extend out into the desert for more than a mile at a 10-degree slope.

2575
02:25:38,597 --> 02:25:45,677
And it's calculated that a 10-degree slope is about the maximum slope that human labor can haul objects up a ramp.

2576
02:25:45,677 --> 02:25:52,277
Um, and that ramp can't just be compacted sand since heavy objects are being hauled up it.

2577
02:25:52,277 --> 02:25:54,237
It's gonna have to be made of very solid material

2578
02:25:54,237 --> 02:25:56,217
almost as solid as the pyramid itself.

2579
02:25:56,217 --> 02:25:57,197
Where is it?

2580
02:25:57,197 --> 02:26:02,717
We don't see any r- any trace of those so-called ramps that are supposed to have been involved in the construction of the pyramid.

2581
02:26:02,717 --> 02:26:04,177
I think we don't know.

2582
02:26:04,177 --> 02:26:05,797
I think we have no idea it's built.

2583
02:26:05,797 --> 02:26:07,657
That's why there's so many different theories.

2584
02:26:07,657 --> 02:26:09,257
We haven't got the answer yet.

2585
02:26:09,257 --> 02:26:12,697
But the how of it is one of the big mysteries from our past.

2586
02:26:12,697 --> 02:26:17,957
I love the Great Pyramids as a kinda puzzle that was created by

2587
02:26:17,957 --> 02:26:20,357
uh, the ancient peoples to be solved- Yeah.

2588
02:26:20,357 --> 02:26:20,377
.

2589
02:26:20,377 --> 02:26:20,417
..

2590
02:26:20,417 --> 02:26:21,117
by later peoples.

2591
02:26:21,117 --> 02:26:23,337
I mean, y- this is, uh, I don't know if you're aware of the

2592
02:26:23,337 --> 02:26:25,617
uh, 10,000 Year Clock, but- I'm not

2593
02:26:25,617 --> 02:26:25,897
no.

2594
02:26:25,897 --> 02:26:25,937
.

2595
02:26:25,937 --> 02:26:26,017
..

2596
02:26:26,017 --> 02:26:30,277
oh, that was built by Jeff Bezos and Danny Hillis- Mm-hmm.

2597
02:26:30,277 --> 02:26:30,303
.

2598
02:26:30,303 --> 02:26:30,357
..

2599
02:26:30,357 --> 02:26:32,537
in, uh, Sierra Diablo Mountains in Texas.

2600
02:26:32,537 --> 02:26:32,797
Right.

2601
02:26:32,797 --> 02:26:36,017
So they're building a clock that ticks once a year for 10

2602
02:26:36,017 --> 02:26:36,597
000 years.

2603
02:26:36,597 --> 02:26:36,997
Oh, wow.

2604
02:26:36,997 --> 02:26:38,642
So it's talking about.

2605
02:26:38,642 --> 02:26:38,757
..

2606
02:26:38,757 --> 02:26:40,897
It, and it's supposed to sort of run

2607
02:26:40,897 --> 02:26:42,837
you know, if there's a nu- nuclear apocalypse

2608
02:26:42,837 --> 02:26:43,617
it just runs.

2609
02:26:43,617 --> 02:26:44,117
It will keep going.

2610
02:26:44,117 --> 02:26:47,537
And it's- it's an example of modern humans thinking like

2611
02:26:47,537 --> 02:26:48,037
"Okay.

2612
02:26:48,037 --> 02:26:53,422
If 10,000 years from now and beyond- Yeah.

2613
02:26:53,422 --> 02:26:58,445
If something goes wrong or, or the future humans that are way different- Mm-hmm.

2614
02:26:58,445 --> 02:26:58,451
.

2615
02:26:58,451 --> 02:26:58,465
..

2616
02:26:58,465 --> 02:26:59,425
come back- Mm-hmm.

2617
02:26:59,425 --> 02:26:59,471
.

2618
02:26:59,471 --> 02:26:59,565
..

2619
02:26:59,565 --> 02:27:02,006
and they, they analyze what happened here

2620
02:27:02,006 --> 02:27:06,266
how can we create monuments that they could then analyze?

2621
02:27:06,266 --> 02:27:06,486
Yeah.

2622
02:27:06,486 --> 02:27:09,685
And is, i- is, in that way be curious about in

2623
02:27:09,685 --> 02:27:13,566
in their curiosity discover some deep truths about this current time?

2624
02:27:13,566 --> 02:27:13,746
Mm-hmm.

2625
02:27:13,746 --> 02:27:13,845
Mm-hmm.

2626
02:27:13,845 --> 02:27:17,185
It's an interesting kinda notion of like what can we build now?

2627
02:27:17,185 --> 02:27:18,166
That would last.

2628
02:27:18,166 --> 02:27:21,805
And the answer is that the majority of what we build now wouldn't last.

2629
02:27:21,805 --> 02:27:22,225
Wouldn't.

2630
02:27:22,225 --> 02:27:23,785
Uh, it would be, it would be gone

2631
02:27:23,785 --> 02:27:25,465
uh, within a few thousand years.

2632
02:27:25,465 --> 02:27:29,705
Um, but what would last is massive megalithic structures

2633
02:27:29,705 --> 02:27:31,526
uh, like the Great Pyramid.

2634
02:27:31,526 --> 02:27:33,945
That would, that would last, uh, and

2635
02:27:33,945 --> 02:27:37,545
and it could be, it could be used to send a message to the future.

2636
02:27:37,545 --> 02:27:41,305
Uh, I think Gobekli Tepe serves a similar function.

2637
02:27:41,305 --> 02:27:42,826
I mean, there it was, it was buried

2638
02:27:42,826 --> 02:27:47,605
uh, 10,400 years ago and then for the next 10

2639
02:27:47,605 --> 02:27:51,465
000 years nobody touched it, nobody knew it was there.

2640
02:27:51,465 --> 02:27:54,365
It, it, it took the genius of Klaus Schmidt

2641
02:27:54,365 --> 02:28:00,125
the original excavator, to realize what he'd found and what it

2642
02:28:00,125 --> 02:28:00,925
and what it was.

2643
02:28:00,925 --> 02:28:03,565
But the great thing about the sealing of Gobekli Tepe

2644
02:28:03,565 --> 02:28:13,545
the deliberate burial of Gobekli Tepe, is it means that no later culture trod over it and imposed their organic materials on it and messed up the dating sequences and so on and so forth

2645
02:28:13,545 --> 02:28:15,585
or vandalized it or used it as a quarry.

2646
02:28:15,585 --> 02:28:17,065
It's all there intact.

2647
02:28:17,065 --> 02:28:24,505
So you mentioned that, uh, the pyramids and some of the other amazing things that humans have built has

2648
02:28:24,505 --> 02:28:28,065
was the results of us humans struggling with our mortality.

2649
02:28:28,065 --> 02:28:31,725
That's the, that's the ultimate, the ultimate goal.

2650
02:28:31,725 --> 02:28:39,625
That seems to me what's at the heart of many pyramids around the world is that they're connected in one way or another to the notion of death

2651
02:28:39,625 --> 02:28:43,705
uh, and to the notion of the exploration of the afterlife.

2652
02:28:43,705 --> 02:28:47,325
And, and this is of course the fundamental mystery that all human beings face.

2653
02:28:47,325 --> 02:28:50,145
We may, we may wish to ignore it

2654
02:28:50,145 --> 02:28:53,165
we may wish to pretend that it's not gonna happen

2655
02:28:53,165 --> 02:28:55,205
but we are of course all mortal.

2656
02:28:55,205 --> 02:29:00,365
Uh, every one of us, all eight billion or however many of us that are on the planet right now

2657
02:29:00,365 --> 02:29:03,325
we're all gonna face death sooner or later.

2658
02:29:03,325 --> 02:29:06,065
And the question is, what happens?

2659
02:29:06,065 --> 02:29:12,245
And there are a few cultures that really intensely deeply studied that mystery.

2660
02:29:12,245 --> 02:29:13,805
We are not one of them.

2661
02:29:13,805 --> 02:29:19,625
The general view of science I think is that we're accidents of evolution.

2662
02:29:19,625 --> 02:29:21,645
When we die, the light blinks out

2663
02:29:21,645 --> 02:29:23,945
there's no more of us, there's no such thing as the soul.

2664
02:29:23,945 --> 02:29:25,305
But that's not a proven point.

2665
02:29:25,305 --> 02:29:27,525
There's no experiment that proves that's the case.

2666
02:29:27,525 --> 02:29:32,025
We know we die, but we don't know whether there's such a thing as a soul or not.

2667
02:29:32,025 --> 02:29:33,805
Yeah, it's the great mystery.

2668
02:29:33,805 --> 02:29:35,845
It's the great mystery that we all share

2669
02:29:35,845 --> 02:29:41,445
and those cultures that have investigated it, and ancient Eg- ancient Egypt is the best example

2670
02:29:41,445 --> 02:29:46,665
uh, have investigated it thoroughly and map out the journey that we make after death.

2671
02:29:46,665 --> 02:29:48,625
But that notion of a journey after death

2672
02:29:48,625 --> 02:29:51,065
and of hazards and challenges along the way

2673
02:29:51,065 --> 02:29:55,745
and ultimately of a judgment, uh, that notion is found right around the world and it

2674
02:29:55,745 --> 02:30:00,925
and it even manifests into the three monotheistic faiths that are still present in the world today.

2675
02:30:00,925 --> 02:30:02,905
Well, you're one such human.

2676
02:30:02,905 --> 02:30:07,845
Uh, and you've said you contemplate your own death.

2677
02:30:07,845 --> 02:30:08,225
Yeah.

2678
02:30:08,225 --> 02:30:09,325
Are y- are you afraid of it?

2679
02:30:09,325 --> 02:30:09,645
No.

2680
02:30:09,645 --> 02:30:11,925
I'm not afraid of death at all.

2681
02:30:11,925 --> 02:30:13,985
Uh, I'm curious about death.

2682
02:30:13,985 --> 02:30:15,985
I think it could be very interesting.

2683
02:30:15,985 --> 02:30:19,905
Uh, I think it's the beginning of the next great adventure.

2684
02:30:19,905 --> 02:30:22,085
Um, so I don't fear it.

2685
02:30:22,085 --> 02:30:24,225
And, and, um, I would like to live as

2686
02:30:24,225 --> 02:30:26,445
as long as I'm, my, my body is

2687
02:30:26,445 --> 02:30:28,725
is, is healthy enough to make living worthwhile.

2688
02:30:28,725 --> 02:30:30,525
Um, but I don't fear death.

2689
02:30:30,525 --> 02:30:32,545
What I do fear is pain.

2690
02:30:32,545 --> 02:30:38,665
Uh, I do fear the humiliation that old age and the collapse of the faculties can bring.

2691
02:30:38,665 --> 02:30:43,885
I do fear the cancers that can strike us down and riddle us with pain and agony.

2692
02:30:43,885 --> 02:30:46,585
That I fear very, very much indeed.

2693
02:30:46,585 --> 02:30:49,605
But death is gonna come to all of us.

2694
02:30:49,605 --> 02:30:50,485
I accept it.

2695
02:30:50,485 --> 02:30:51,685
It's gonna come to me.

2696
02:30:51,685 --> 02:30:54,645
And I'm not gonna say I'm looking forward to it

2697
02:30:54,645 --> 02:30:57,405
but when it happens I'm going to approach it

2698
02:30:57,405 --> 02:31:00,865
I hope, with a sense of curiosity and a sense of adventure

2699
02:31:00,865 --> 02:31:03,345
uh, that there's something beyond this life.

2700
02:31:03,345 --> 02:31:05,685
Uh, it isn't heaven, it isn't hell

2701
02:31:05,685 --> 02:31:07,745
but there's something.

2702
02:31:07,745 --> 02:31:09,305
The soul goes on.

2703
02:31:09,305 --> 02:31:13,265
I think reincarnation is a very plausible idea.

2704
02:31:13,265 --> 02:31:15,405
Again, modern science would reject that.

2705
02:31:15,405 --> 02:31:17,965
But there's the excellent work of Ian Stevenson

2706
02:31:17,965 --> 02:31:20,825
Children Who Remember Past Lives, uh, who

2707
02:31:20,825 --> 02:31:25,305
who found that children up to the age of seven often have memories of past lives.

2708
02:31:25,305 --> 02:31:31,645
And in cultures where memories of past lives are discouraged they tend not to express that much

2709
02:31:31,645 --> 02:31:34,205
but in cultures where memories of past lives are encouraged

2710
02:31:34,205 --> 02:31:36,345
like India, they do express it.

2711
02:31:36,345 --> 02:31:39,845
And he found several subjects, children under the age of seven in India

2712
02:31:39,845 --> 02:31:47,405
who were able to remember specific details of a past life and he was able to go to the place where that past life unfolded and validate those

2713
02:31:47,405 --> 02:31:48,625
those, those details.

2714
02:31:48,625 --> 02:31:51,865
So if, if consciousness is the basis of everything

2715
02:31:51,865 --> 02:31:58,045
if it's the essence of everything and consciousness benefits in some way from being incarnated in physical form

2716
02:31:58,045 --> 02:32:00,125
then reincarnation makes a lot of sense.

2717
02:32:00,125 --> 02:32:04,445
All the investment that the universe has put into creating this home for life

2718
02:32:04,445 --> 02:32:06,725
uh, may have a much bigger purpose than

2719
02:32:06,725 --> 02:32:08,705
than just accident.

2720
02:32:08,705 --> 02:32:12,285
What a beautiful mystery this whole thing is.

2721
02:32:12,285 --> 02:32:12,525
Yeah.

2722
02:32:12,525 --> 02:32:13,685
We are immersed in mystery.

2723
02:32:13,685 --> 02:32:15,025
We live in the midst of mystery.

2724
02:32:15,025 --> 02:32:16,165
We're surrounded by mystery.

2725
02:32:16,165 --> 02:32:19,565
And if we pere- pretend otherwise, we're deluding ourselves.

2726
02:32:19,565 --> 02:32:23,605
And Graham, thank you so much for inspiring the world to explore that mystery.

2727
02:32:23,605 --> 02:32:24,805
Thank you for talking today.

2728
02:32:24,805 --> 02:32:25,605
Thank you, Lex.

2729
02:32:25,605 --> 02:32:26,285
It's been a pleasure.

2730
02:32:26,285 --> 02:32:30,045

And now let me leave you with some words from Charles Darwin

2733
02:32:37,625 --> 02:32:41,365
"It is not the strongest of the species that survives

2734
02:32:41,365 --> 02:32:43,625
nor the most intelligent.

2735
02:32:43,625 --> 02:32:48,095
It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.

2736
02:32:48,095 --> 02:32:52,605
" Thank you for listening, and I hope to see you next time.
