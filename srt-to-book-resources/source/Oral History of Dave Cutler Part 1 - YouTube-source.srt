1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,049
i'm grant seever

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,048
uh

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:08,250
triced

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,210
the computer history museum here with dave cutler in his living room in belleview on a beautiful seattle day

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,210
uh

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,170
nice weather for a change

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,769
the winter may be ending

8
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:20,769
uh

9
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:20,890
toh

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,810
discuss with dave

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,810
his long career in the computer industry

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:26,810
and

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,410
um

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,769
so we'll

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,210
uh

16
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,730
we'll begin

17
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:30,849
so

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:31,610
uh

19
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,610
uh

20
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:33,450
we were talking about

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,250
uh

22
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,329
before this

23
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:36,410
your entry into computers

24
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,170
but let's roll back a bit into early childhood and living in michigan and

25
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:42,649
and

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,090
uh

27
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,329
being near the i guess oldsmobile factory and lancing

28
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,809
so tell us a little bit about

29
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:50,449
uh

30
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,730
your early days and getting high school

31
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,170
and so on

32
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,170
well

33
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:55,489
i was

34
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,010
um

35
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,250
i grew up in dwit michigan

36
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,250
uh

37
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,170
which is about 10 miles south of or i'm sorry north of lancing

38
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,050
where oos mobile is at

39
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,330
i went to dt high school

40
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:07,850
um

41
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,650
i was a um

42
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,290
primarily an athlete

43
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,049
not a student

44
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,409
although i had pretty good grades at dt

45
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,170
i was a 16l uh athlete

46
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,409
i played uh

47
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:22,290
football basketball baseball and ran track

48
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,170
um

49
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,170
and

50
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,650
uh

51
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,369
i'm a michigan state fan

52
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,329
michigan state's was right there in east lancing

53
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,770
so i grew up close to east lancing in michigan state

54
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,770
um

55
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,090
early on

56
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:39,610
i

57
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,610
um

58
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,930
was very interested in model airplanes and built a lot of model airplanes and wanted to be a pilot

59
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,810
when i grew up

60
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,450
but somehow that just went by the way

61
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,930
and later on i discovered i had motion sickness problems anyway

62
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,930
so that wasn't going to make it

63
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:56,930
um

64
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,289
so that's pretty much my early

65
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,329
so the model airplanes kind of k

66
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,810
kindled a technical interest in in aviation and flying and and how that worked

67
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:09,810
uh

68
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:10,128
well

69
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:10,369
i

70
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,770
i don't know how i got into model airplanes

71
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,250
there was a local shop that

72
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:16,209
um

73
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,209
uh

74
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:20,970
was like a hobby shop that sold model airplanes and i got interested in building them

75
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,330
and then

76
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,569
of course

77
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:21,890
you know

78
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,330
you keep

79
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,930
you build bigger ones and bigger ones and you try to build powered ones and

80
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,810
and i built the powered ones and and i mostly crashed them

81
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,569
so i don't know if it really fostered a technical interest

82
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,569
but um certainly was something that i was interested in for quite a while

83
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,690
but then kind of sports took over in high school and um

84
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,170
i became more interested in sports

85
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,930
so the sports led to an opportunity to go to do at college

86
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:51,930
uh

87
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,530
all of at college

88
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:53,290
i'm sorry

89
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,290
all of at college and u

90
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,170
uh

91
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,010
athletics were a big part of making that possible

92
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,650
weren't they

93
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,290
um

94
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:01,730
i

95
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,769
in fact i went to al college

96
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:04,569
um

97
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,209
they offered me

98
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,209
um

99
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:08,930
pretty much a full ride

100
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,049
i had an academic scholarship and i had uh scholarships

101
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:12,690
for

102
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,250
basketball

103
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,129
baseball and football

104
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,170
and i would probably not have went to college if i hadn't had a full ride

105
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,890
um

106
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,129
because i we couldn't afford it and i had applied a couple other places

107
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,610
i i really wanted to go to central michigan and um

108
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,489
they didn't accept me

109
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:33,489
um

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,409
and the the thing at olette worked out really well was close to home

111
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:38,730
um

112
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,250
and that's where i ended up and how did you decide on the course program

113
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,370
that you take all of it

114
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,370
uh

115
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,890
when i got there at allette

116
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,209
i didn't really know

117
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,209
um

118
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,129
i think

119
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:54,769
like most students

120
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,209
what i really wanted to

121
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:56,849
uh

122
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,129
study and

123
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,409
um

124
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,409
i

125
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:01,689
you

126
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:01,810
know

127
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,049
i

128
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:04,090
i don't know why i i decided on math

129
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,290
other than it was

130
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,650
it was a a very interesting challenging thing

131
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,170
and then after i got in decided math was my major

132
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,610
then it was natural for me to say

133
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,290
well

134
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,570
i ought to have a lot of physics

135
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,250
so i took a lot of physics and i really enjoyed math and physics

136
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,009
um

137
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,090
i didn't enjoy some of the other things

138
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,530
olette is a liberal arts school

139
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,130
so there was a lot of liberal arts requirements

140
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,130
um

141
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,650
it's also a religiously affiliated school

142
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,090
although really not tightly religiously affiliated

143
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,210
but there was a lot of stuff i had to take that was religious related

144
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,210
um

145
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,729
but i sort of gravitated towards the math and the physics

146
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:44,530
and

147
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,009
uh

148
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,490
it worked out

149
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,210
well

150
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,210
great

151
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,169
so that that you know you're

152
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,250
you're progressing through college and thinking about what's next

153
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,009
what where where the career might lead

154
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:55,090
where you might go to work

155
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,690
uh

156
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,810
how did that prog any jobs during college

157
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:58,410
by the way

158
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,370
uh

159
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,009
did i have any jobs during college

160
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,449
the answerers

161
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:02,889
no

162
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,250
i

163
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,610
i had

164
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,130
um

165
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,570
i was so busy playing sports and um

166
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,810
later on

167
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,210
i

168
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,729
you know

169
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:10,009
the first

170
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,570
the first two years of college

171
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,449
i played mostly sports and studied just enough to get by and keep my academic scholarship

172
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,770
and then the last two years

173
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,330
i really you might say applied myself and

174
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,449
uh

175
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,410
try to um

176
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,610
be a good student

177
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,050
what happened to me was

178
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,850
um

179
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,569
within a span of 18 months

180
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,650
i had my right knee operated on and they pulled out the medial miniscus

181
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,250
i broke my left leg

182
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,970
and then i had my left leg operated on and they pulled out the medial miniscus there

183
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,810
so i was pretty much done with sports at the end of two years

184
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:50,850
and during those two years

185
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,210
i think that i mainly thought about that

186
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,449
that

187
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:55,810
you know

188
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,889
i never thought that it was

189
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:59,330
it was really going to end that i was going to be

190
00:05:59,340 --> 00:05:59,610
you know

191
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,289
i just thinking about

192
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,610
well

193
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,130
i'm just going to be playing sports forever

194
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,330
and then

195
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,130
after two years

196
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,810
it's sort of like

197
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,050
well

198
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,530
i'm not going to be playing sports forever

199
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,610
what do i really want to do

200
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,690
and so i'm really not sure what i really want to do

201
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:19,009
but i think i really like math and i like physics and i'm a uh

202
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,130
hands-on kind of person that likes to build things

203
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,330
so i really think that i would like to have some kind of an engineering job somewhere

204
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,169
so i was sort of aiming at

205
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:29,889
um

206
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:30,810
an engineering job

207
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,970
not going to an engineering school in

208
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:34,690
uh

209
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,770
a time era where it was possible that such a thing could happen

210
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:39,729
uh

211
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,090
today

212
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,050
that would probably be kind of like

213
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:43,849
uh

214
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,009
pretty remote that somebody could do that

215
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,250
i mean if you had a math degree

216
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,050
you probably wouldn't step into a mechanical engineering job or something like that

217
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:52,930
um

218
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,210
of course

219
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,449
you could

220
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,530
you could step into a computer engineering job

221
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,770
computer engineers

222
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,770
um

223
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,370
a lot of different disciplines make good computer engineers

224
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:02,289
um

225
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,009
so

226
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,090
anyway

227
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,090
my

228
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,169
my goal

229
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,169
um

230
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:13,770
in the last few years was to finish my degree and find an engineering job

231
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,770
and and how did that go

232
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,210
i mean you

233
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,449
did you start interviewing companies

234
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,650
companies come to the campus

235
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,210
or

236
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:19,849
uh

237
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:20,610
in those days

238
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,610
um

239
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,050
the companies didn't come to the campuses

240
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:23,849
you

241
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,009
we're talking 1965 and uh

242
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:32,610
at least they didn't come to our campus and and i i just mainly applied to um

243
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,530
a lot of different companies

244
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,530
i applied to

245
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:34,970
uh

246
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,009
lock heat and and the aerospace companies

247
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,050
and i applied to general motors

248
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,849
and i

249
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,410
you know

250
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,690
i applied to dupont

251
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:43,690
uh

252
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,169
i don't know how i happened to apply to dupont

253
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,530
i i saw a ad somewhere probably or something

254
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,050
and

255
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,449
um

256
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,050
sort of waited for people to come back

257
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,169
and you know

258
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:52,970
say

259
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:53,449
hey

260
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:54,889
we want to interview you

261
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,650
it turned out that i

262
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,930
i ended up actually having three solid job offers

263
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,370
one was from chrysler in a soft trim plant

264
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,370
uh

265
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,409
which was um door panels and soft soft trim in a

266
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,530
in an automobile is basically the inside and i would be a

267
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:14,930
uh

268
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,330
they

269
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,770
the job

270
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,970
there was a time and studies

271
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,210
kind of operations research

272
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,650
kind of job

273
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:20,650
um

274
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,330
in a town that wasn't too far from where i lived

275
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,449
i had a a a firm offer from os mobile to work in their

276
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,330
uh

277
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,769
computer accounting department

278
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:32,929
you know

279
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:38,250
i had an offer from dupont to work there in a job that was supposedly engineering job

280
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,208
so i sort of decided i didn't want to work for o mobile

281
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,810
because i didn't want an accounting job

282
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,050
um

283
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,209
there was

284
00:08:48,219 --> 00:08:48,450
no

285
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,810
you know

286
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,410
i didn't know anything about computer science at that time

287
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,730
and i computers were around and people used them for records keeping and accounting kind of things

288
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,089
and of course there were people at unity

289
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,610
i ities

290
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,610
um

291
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,290
that were using them for other things

292
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,970
but mostly when you talked about computers

293
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,050
the general public knowledge about computers was accounting and records keeping

294
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,290
and that's mostly what the ibm machines were was recordkeeping and accounting

295
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,050
so i decided i didn't want to work there either

296
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,570
and so i decided to to

297
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:18,930
uh

298
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,730
go to wilmington delaware and take the job with dupont

299
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,250
and was that job

300
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,209
what you expected

301
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:25,209
uh

302
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:25,730
was the job

303
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,290
what i expected

304
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:26,810
no

305
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,730
it was a

306
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,050
it was a life lesson and interviewing

307
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,130
and um

308
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,209
that when you interview and you decide you'd like to go to work for a company

309
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,370
you really really should pin them down about what you're going to be doing when you get there

310
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,410
because if you don't

311
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,010
you may not be doing that

312
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,089
and i thought i was going into an engineering job a little bit

313
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,050
um

314
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,290
undefined

315
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,329
but i ended up when i got there

316
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:52,970
uh

317
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,290
with a job that was a tech writer

318
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,250
writing

319
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,050
um

320
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,730
standard test methods for dupont elastomeric materials division

321
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,529
which were basically

322
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:04,529
uh

323
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:09,329
methods on how you stretch and pull and bounce

324
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:10,329
um

325
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,250
synthetic rubber

326
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,649
that's pretty far from computers

327
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:14,329
what

328
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:14,730
uh

329
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,529
what was the first step into computers

330
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,529
uh

331
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:19,490
my first step into computing was

332
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,250
uh

333
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,250
with a group at the same lab

334
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,890
i was at

335
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,250
which was a sales service lab

336
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,170
which helped

337
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,170
uh

338
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,329
dupont

339
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,130
customers apply dupont prod products to their products

340
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,850
uh

341
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:38,250
dupont basically made um raw materials for other people to use in developing a project or product

342
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:38,970
uh

343
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:39,529
for instance

344
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,290
uh

345
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,010
the elastomeric materials division made neoprene

346
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,610
and neoprene went into a lot of uh things like wet suits

347
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,370
and even went into tires for a long time

348
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,370
um

349
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,850
so there was another group there

350
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,410
which was a math

351
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,170
and sta group

352
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,329
and i'd interviewed with them and they were interested in me and after about a year here

353
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,410
they asked if i could

354
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,209
um be lent to that group for a for a

355
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,089
a short amount of time to develop

356
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:08,970
um

357
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,730
a

358
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,730
a model of a phone process for scott paper company

359
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,730
go

360
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:17,730
okay

361
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,970
so we were talking about

362
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:19,850
uh

363
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,010
a pham making process at dupont and some challenges in that

364
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,649
that led to a computing

365
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,570
so dupont was trying to help scott paper company with a new process that they had developed

366
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,570
uh

367
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,649
to make foam for gar

368
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,450
the garment industry

369
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,730
and

370
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,730
uh

371
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:37,970
the

372
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,010
the guy at the uh lab

373
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,529
dupont lab

374
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,889
that was in the

375
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:44,209
the

376
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,329
um manager of the math

377
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:52,810
and stat group wanted to build a model to help them schedule the production on this new machine

378
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,730
and so i

379
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,730
they asked if i could do that model

380
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:57,450
and i said

381
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:57,769
yeah

382
00:11:57,779 --> 00:11:59,450
i do that because i was so bored to tear

383
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,649
trying to write these test methods that nobody seemed to like what i was writing

384
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,490
so they sent me off to uh school with ibm to to learn a language called gpss

385
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,250
3

386
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,050
gpss 3 was general general system simulator 3

387
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,850
general gpss

388
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,930
general purpose system simulator

389
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,250
general purpose system simulator 3

390
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,089
which was i their third

391
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:24,889
um

392
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:25,850
a

393
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:27,690
their third version of this

394
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,050
gpss is a language that's a a

395
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,570
um

396
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,570
an event driven block oriented language

397
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,250
where

398
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,250
uh

399
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,050
you have a number of of different uh blocks

400
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,050
or you could look at them as functions that perform a specific kind of thing like um

401
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:45,850
create

402
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,690
transaction was a block so you could create transactions into the

403
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:53,089
um

404
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,410
the system that you're trying to simulate these

405
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,730
all these all operated in parallel

406
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,209
too

407
00:12:57,219 --> 00:12:57,449
right

408
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,209
it was a parallel event language

409
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:00,930
if i remember

410
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,290
right

411
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,529
yes

412
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:01,810
it is

413
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,529
i'm sorry

414
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,810
it is the language

415
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:04,930
uh

416
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:05,930
um

417
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,970
tried to simulate a

418
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,850
a realtime um process

419
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,050
a realtime um system and the

420
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,290
the

421
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,410
everything was running in parallel

422
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,250
but there was no

423
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,449
there was no

424
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,690
um need for synchronization

425
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,290
so you were kind of removed from the synchronization aspect of building this model

426
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:34,970
and i end up building a fairly large model and partway through the building of the model

427
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,889
i got really interested in in more about how the computer worked than how the the model worked

428
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,570
so i began to

429
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,130
uh

430
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,329
really dig in a lot about the computer architecture

431
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,930
the machine i was running on

432
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,730
the machine that we ran this model on was an ibm um

433
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:55,449
4044

434
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:56,449
70

435
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:56,889
yeah

436
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:57,209
it's a 44

437
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,009
4044

438
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,089
7440

439
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,250
maybe

440
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,250
anyway

441
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,570
it was a

442
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,570
it was the precursor to the 7094

443
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:06,570
well

444
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:06,810
79

445
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,170
so maybe it was a 7

446
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:08,730
it was a 7044

447
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,009
that's what it was

448
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,290
yeah

449
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,410
7044

450
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,209
7044

451
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,290
it was a 36 bit machine

452
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,730
and um

453
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,570
this

454
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,009
this is

455
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:17,529
uh

456
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:18,889
the time that i

457
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,329
i really learned how fallible humans are

458
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:21,730
and

459
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,690
and learned a lot of humility about programming and the fact that computers only do exactly what you say

460
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,529
and not what you mean

461
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,250
and i i went up to the ibm data center

462
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:35,529
we had to go up to philadelphia to go to the imm ibm data center

463
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,209
and with my deck of 2000 cards with all kinds of time free time

464
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,089
this time

465
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,009
um

466
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,089
scheduled with the ibm representative and my boss and everything

467
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,089
and we're jolly going up there

468
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:51,130
and we're going to run this model

469
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,970
and we get there

470
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,810
and we spend all the time trying to take the the syntax er out of the program

471
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,170
and we we never got them out the first day

472
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,130
so that was a really humiliating experience

473
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,050
so the so the gpss project finally worked

474
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,970
and you delivered some weit

475
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:11,810
the gps

476
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,690
the gps project or gpss project

477
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,570
uh

478
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,610
ran for i think about a year

479
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,610
and

480
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:21,810
uh

481
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,610
we had somebody from scott paper assigned to work with me that actually was a

482
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,250
was a somebody similar to me

483
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,329
very little experience and a young guy

484
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,290
and he and i would go up to the data center and run this model and we would

485
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,410
we would feed information into it and try to get results out

486
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:40,850
and we

487
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,529
what we're trying to do was we were trying to figure out how

488
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,050
or what the best um schedule was for scheduling a

489
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:50,329
a

490
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,930
a number of different colors

491
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:59,490
and textures of foam on this machine to get the best productivity out out of the machine and we

492
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,370
you know

493
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,209
eventually they

494
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,490
we

495
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,170
we got the model to work and we said

496
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:03,529
okay

497
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,130
you know

498
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,889
give us a question to ask the model and they came up with a question about scheduling

499
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,649
and we ran that and we had

500
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:11,690
you know

501
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,130
a big presentation

502
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:12,970
and

503
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:13,970
and

504
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,370
uh

505
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,089
we handed over the model to them and said okay

506
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:17,649
here's the model

507
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,250
you know

508
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,449
all you have to do is go to the ibm data center

509
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,009
run this

510
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,329
and you have a guy that can run this

511
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,810
and i really don't know what they did after that

512
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,889
i suspect they did very little with it

513
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,250
but it was sort of a

514
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,529
um

515
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:33,209
a lot of it was public relations on dupont

516
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,490
having a a vested interest in seeing

517
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,009
that scott paper company had the best support they could possibly get to run their phone process

518
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:47,410
so this initial 4a into computers then leads to digging deeper into how computers really work

519
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,290
and how operating systems really work

520
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,449
so after after this project

521
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:52,449
uh

522
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:53,050
i sort of

523
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,009
you know

524
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,089
got more interested in computing

525
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,930
and decided that i would really like to stay in the math and stat group

526
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,369
so i stayed in the math and stat group and and worked on various things

527
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,970
we had a 1108

528
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:08,970
well

529
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,970
it was 11 : 07 to start with univac machine at the at the experimental station

530
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,849
which was

531
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,049
i don't know

532
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:15,169
15

533
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,530
20 miles away and there was a shuttle that ran back and forth every day and we could submit

534
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,730
uh programs to run on that computer and get the results back

535
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,250
so i started doing some of that stuff for the math and stat group

536
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,809
and i also got involved with um with procuring a

537
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,210
a cdc 1700

538
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,289
which is a 16-bit machine to automate the

539
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:38,890
um

540
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,049
the instron

541
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,610
machines

542
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,650
which was a tensil

543
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:42,970
that's a tensil

544
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,410
strength testing machine

545
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,410
um

546
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,130
for the lab

547
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,090
and so i got pretty interested in that

548
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,090
um

549
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,450
and this all lasted

550
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,890
i would say maybe about two years

551
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,330
and then i started to think about

552
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,010
i really wanted to be somewhere where i was working more on computing computers

553
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,010
uh

554
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,010
rather than working on computers as a tool to solve other problems

555
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,370
so i succeeded in negotiating a transfer to the engineering department

556
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,010
a dupont

557
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,210
which had lots of computing capability and there they're the ones had the 1107

558
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,409
which they upgraded

559
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,530
the 1108 and uh

560
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,570
i joined the online systems group there

561
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,650
so the

562
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:30,049
the

563
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:30,770
uh

564
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,010
the 1108 uh and 1107 had a product called exec

565
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,370
2

566
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:36,929
which

567
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,330
uh

568
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,289
was kind of notoriously flaky

569
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,289
well

570
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:42,929
the okay

571
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:43,250
so the

572
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:43,409
on

573
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,610
what what did i do in the online systems group

574
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,370
um

575
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,490
basically i was trying to help um

576
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,730
the engineering service division

577
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,049
which was part with the online system group within was trying to help

578
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,049
uh

579
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,049
the operating departments

580
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,490
the operating plants within the elastomer department

581
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,490
um

582
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,929
actually with the engineering department was a whole company

583
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,409
so there was 13 operating departments

584
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,929
so they're trying to help them with their computer

585
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:09,929
uh

586
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,289
process control needs within the company

587
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,690
but there were

588
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,250
there was a lot of downtime

589
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,289
because we were project oriented and we're trying to go out and sell our services to somebody

590
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,370
so there was a lot of time when there wasn't much to do

591
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,770
so i sort of had got interested in the 1107 1108

592
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,970
and i went to the system programming group

593
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:38,530
and asked them if there was anything i could do for them and they said

594
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,010
well

595
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,530
yeah

596
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:42,690
i could probably help them figure out why

597
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,690
exec 2

598
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,770
which was the operating system

599
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,530
the 1108 was crashing so often

600
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,490
so they said what we want you to do is figure this out

601
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,890
and every time this the 1108 crashes

602
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,890
we take a dump and a dump is about

603
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:57,890
um

604
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:58,929
well

605
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:02,370
four four inches of fanfold paper

606
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,370
um

607
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,169
which is a

608
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,730
i think octal dump and um

609
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,690
we want you to figure out why or what's wrong with the system

610
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,730
so at times i would have a stack of these dumps that was 6 feet high in my office

611
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,929
and looking

612
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:19,330
you know

613
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,690
trying to figure out what the pattern was for this and

614
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,610
and i i found

615
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:24,490
um

616
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,809
several problems that were our fault

617
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:27,809
um

618
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:28,730
our fault being dupons

619
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,010
because we made

620
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:30,890
uh

621
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,250
i would say about 2, 000 lines of modifications to exec two

622
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,250
um

623
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,730
but i never really did really figure out what was really wrong

624
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,090
and i guess an interesting side story is that later on

625
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,450
when i was working at um

626
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,970
at microsoft in the early 80 or the late

627
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:51,809
i guess the early 90s

628
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,370
somebody from the university of washington in st louis did a study on the timing of the 1108

629
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,250
and and came to the conclusion that it would go metastable every four hours

630
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,250
because of the synchronizers in the system

631
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,770
didn't synchronize all the clocks properly

632
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,330
so i guess that was the real answer to why it was so flaky

633
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,730
so this is kind of immersion by fire into what an operating system is

634
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:18,730
uh

635
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,570
it is it

636
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,130
and i

637
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:20,490
you know

638
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,770
i spent a lot of time on the i'm

639
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:23,409
i

640
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,010
i should say

641
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,770
let me say

642
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:25,770
um

643
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,610
this was trial by fire

644
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,090
um

645
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,650
i was at the end of trying to figure out why something didn't work

646
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,490
which made me figure out why how it worked all right

647
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,210
so i had to figure out how it worked

648
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,890
to find out why it didn't work

649
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,570
and i'd be in these dumps and you know i'd trace back in the dump

650
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:46,570
you know

651
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,690
maybe a thousand instructions

652
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,169
and then the

653
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:50,650
the trail would just poof

654
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,529
it's gone like it's just gone

655
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,450
so eventually they

656
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,169
they got to the point

657
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,210
where they trusted me enough

658
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,370
that that i actually actually became one of the main people that maintained the system

659
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,169
and made improvements to it

660
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,730
what we thought were improvements

661
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,970
and put in um dupont specific changes to to streamline the operation of the 1108

662
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,370
so this

663
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,130
this is now

664
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,690
i know something about operating systems and i want to take my career further in that direction

665
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,529
um operating systems really interested me

666
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,570
and you know

667
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,770
i don't know why i decided that boy

668
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,010
that was the way i wanted to go

669
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:34,250
but it was really the way i wanted to go

670
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,850
and maybe i didn't know it exactly at that point

671
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:38,890
but but i sure

672
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,490
some of the most satisfying time i had was on the 11 : 08

673
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:44,929
um

674
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,730
and then i

675
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,210
i

676
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:48,730
the online system

677
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,929
part of it actually kicked in at one point or a couple points

678
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,450
where we did get some big things to do

679
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,690
we got a a big job to to work on at the u experimental station

680
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,850
which was dupont's main research center

681
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,730
which is a fairly big site

682
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:11,610
it was 120 acres and all 13 operating departments had um offices there

683
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:12,970
um

684
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,610
so they decided that they would like to automate the analysis of um

685
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,250
some of their instrumentation instrument data

686
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,770
and we proposed a dual pdp10 system to do that

687
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,370
we spent

688
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,169
i don't know

689
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:31,169
maybe six months with various other vendors

690
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,690
ibm being a vendor

691
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:33,690
uh

692
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:33,850
sds

693
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,730
if you remember

694
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,970
sds scientific data systems being a vendor

695
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,770
that we looked at the sigma 5 um and we decided the pdp10 was the best alternative

696
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,730
so we we built or we bought a pdp10 a dual pdp10 system with shared memory

697
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,730
uh

698
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,049
special

699
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:51,890
built by computer

700
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,730
special systems at dupon or not dupon

701
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:55,409
uh

702
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,809
digital and um

703
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,970
then we wrote one of the

704
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,850
we wrote an operating system for one of them

705
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,130
which was really the front end

706
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,130
um

707
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,690
and it brought in all the data

708
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,730
and then when the data was complete

709
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,250
it submitted it through the shared memory directly to the tops 10 system

710
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,970
which then did the analysis of programs written in fortran and then we shipped the the uh results back

711
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,650
so i got quite a bit of experience on uh deck

712
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,010
pp10s

713
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,010
um

714
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,210
became pretty knowledgeable about p

715
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:27,529
uh

716
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:27,690
the

717
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,130
the top stand went to digital

718
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,250
to a school on top stand

719
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,049
um

720
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,490
which was run by dave plumber

721
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,490
which was u digital's number one

722
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,809
uh guy about

723
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,370
uh

724
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,090
running courses on um

725
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,049
the tops 10

726
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:45,330
so after that

727
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,049
i came back

728
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,809
uh to the engineering department

729
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,169
and they gave me another job that was on deck equipment

730
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,890
which was a pdp11 uh

731
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,809
gauge control system for cronar film

732
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,289
which was used in magnetic tape

733
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,049
and this system was

734
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:01,570
uh

735
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,130
a pdp 1120

736
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,570
and at that time there was no suitable operating system for from digital

737
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,649
not digital

738
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,049
yeah

739
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:10,250
digital

740
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,450
no suitable operating system from digital

741
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,289
that would actually do this

742
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:16,130
we were going to do this on a very small pb11

743
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,690
i think it probably only had 8k of memory

744
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:19,809
um

745
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,370
so i was given the the task of developing the

746
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:25,330
the little runtime

747
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,130
the little real-time runtime system

748
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,010
to to to

749
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:28,289
uh

750
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:28,610
do the

751
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,610
the cronar gauge control system

752
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:32,850
um

753
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:33,850
so

754
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,529
when i finished that

755
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,130
i sort of decided that maybe it was time for me to to move on

756
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:42,929
and and think about something else

757
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:43,929
um

758
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:44,929
in fact

759
00:25:44,939 --> 00:25:50,210
what i was thinking about was i'd move from from using computers to solve problems

760
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,409
to actually working on computers themselves

761
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,770
but with not within a computer company

762
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,409
and i thought

763
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,690
well

764
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,330
if i really want to max maximize my value to a company

765
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:03,610
and i want to be in the operating system business

766
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,049
i ought to go to a company that builds computers

767
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,330
so i arranged an interview with digital in um

768
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,450
mater massachusetts

769
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,809
and lo and behold

770
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,529
they hired me

771
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,490
so off the digital

772
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,690
i went

773
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,690
uh

774
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,490
just backtrack

775
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,490
a little bit here

776
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,250
what did you

777
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,289
what did you think of dupont in the year you were there for six years and an interesting culture

778
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,289
what was i

779
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:31,090
i was at dupont for seven years and

780
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:32,529
uh

781
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,010
the culture at dupont was very

782
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:35,730
um

783
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,730
kind of like really foreign to me

784
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,770
because it was very

785
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,970
it was an old company dupont was founded

786
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,370
i think in the mid 1800s

787
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:45,850
um

788
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:46,850
they

789
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,450
they supplied um

790
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,370
black powder during the civil war

791
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,370
um

792
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,210
that's how they got their start was black powder

793
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,010
um

794
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,529
a very bureaucratic

795
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,289
company

796
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,450
um

797
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,330
very regimented

798
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:00,809
um

799
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,090
you didn't tend to do things like go talk to your boss's boss

800
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:07,330
um

801
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,610
so it was

802
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,169
um

803
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,210
you know

804
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,809
i would

805
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,169
i had a good time at dupont and it was great for my career

806
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:17,169
but

807
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,610
um

808
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,250
i didn't feel as comfortable there as i actually ended up feeling it at deck

809
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,529
which was a very different kind of company

810
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,330
so did you

811
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,010
did you have a sense of what the deck culture was like

812
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,970
when you decided it was time to move to there

813
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:31,970
uh

814
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,130
when i went to deck

815
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,890
i had absolutely no idea what the culture was

816
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:40,049
other than the fact that i had went to the pdp10 programming course

817
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,769
so i was

818
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:41,409
um

819
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,450
a little bit acclimated to the

820
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:44,970
the

821
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,370
uh

822
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,649
the facilities that we're all

823
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:48,210
the digital

824
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,690
was in a mill and the mill was old

825
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,090
it led back to the mid 1800s also

826
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,090
uh

827
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,090
but not not really anything about the culture

828
00:27:59,519 --> 00:27:59,970
i i

829
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,169
you know

830
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,450
and i i never really thought about that

831
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:03,769
um

832
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,450
i think i thought more about the opportunity than i did about

833
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,130
you know

834
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,330
was the culture going to be the same or different

835
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,450
you know

836
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,130
if the culture had been the same as it was at dupon

837
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,610
i still would have went because the col or the opportunity was better

838
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,610
so talk a little bit about the getting started at deck

839
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,769
you know who

840
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,529
who was your first boss and what was the direction of the

841
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,450
the task at hand

842
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,010
my first job

843
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,010
well

844
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:33,850
let's let's back up a little bit about what i was hired for at digital

845
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,289
this is a kind of like

846
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:39,210
maybe another instance of um

847
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,809
not knowing exactly what you'd end up doing

848
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,929
although i really had this one tied down and i was going to work on something called os 45

849
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:51,809
and os 45 was a dream of dave stones

850
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,370
who was the head of programming at at digital

851
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,289
and the 45 had some special solid state memory that you could buy

852
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,130
that was 300 nond memory

853
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,610
and this is in 1971

854
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,649
and the pdp10 was

855
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:09,330
at that time

856
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:10,769
i think the best pd

857
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,130
well

858
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,809
the pdp10 was a a a above microsc machine

859
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,690
so this was

860
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,289
this was a very fast machine

861
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:26,169
and dave stone had this vision that we were going to recreate tops 10 on the 45 and um

862
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,090
we were also going to incorporate realtime system pro or realtime capabilities

863
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,730
and batch capabilities in addition to the time sharing

864
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,649
and there was a group of people that was assembled

865
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,330
that was probably about eight people

866
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,330
and um

867
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,649
the leader and of the group

868
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,850
and my initial boss was um

869
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,610
peter van rokin

870
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,570
peter came from rca and he was responsible for the development of vmos vos

871
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,690
which was the virtual memory operating system that ran on the rca ibm compatible machines

872
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,570
and so i came to digital and i spent probably the first two or three months

873
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,610
um

874
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,690
thinking about all this stuff

875
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,570
and the group was thinking about all this stuff

876
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,490
and then all of a sudden

877
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,210
um

878
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,610
we weren't really making a lot of progress on this

879
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:23,049
because there was one little small problem

880
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,570
that dave stone hadn't really considered as much as he really should have

881
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,809
and that was that the address space the pdp1 was 65k bytes and 65k

882
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,330
bytes

883
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,330
uh

884
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,970
just wasn't going to cut it for an address space

885
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,730
and the memory management capabilities weren't that great either

886
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:43,730
uh

887
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,970
so we had an awful hard time really getting started

888
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,529
and getting up to speed on what we were going to really do with this os

889
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:51,769
45

890
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,130
so there was another project

891
00:30:54,279 --> 00:31:05,049
that was going on over in the industrial products group develop a a uh process control system for uh

892
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:07,490
or process control os for the pdp11

893
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,090
it was called rsx1 c

894
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,169
and they had been working on that for a couple years

895
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,130
and it was going nowhere and they asked me if i would go work on that

896
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,450
and i said

897
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:18,850
well

898
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:19,529
yeah

899
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:19,690
sure

900
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,210
i guess i will go work on that

901
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:21,929
um

902
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:22,690
you know

903
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,289
we're not doing much on this other project

904
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,809
so the first project i worked on really as far as real work was the rsx1 c system

905
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,690
and the the rsx1 series

906
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,690
uh

907
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,570
ended up cdm or something like that

908
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,090
if our my recollection is correct

909
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,090
rx11 c was the kind of like the first in the series of the rsx systems

910
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,730
which were primarily sponsored by the industrial products group but were also

911
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,610
uh

912
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,570
sponsored by the laboratory data products group

913
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,970
also because they were in the real-time business and um

914
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,409
rs 61c

915
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,330
was

916
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,610
uh

917
00:31:58,639 --> 00:31:58,889
really

918
00:31:59,600 --> 00:31:59,850
um

919
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,169
kind of like

920
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,570
was a just a coreon

921
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:04,570
uh

922
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,610
system that supported a few peripherals

923
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,970
um addd converters

924
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:10,889
um

925
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,289
um terminal interfaces

926
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:14,289
um

927
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,330
that was about it

928
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,889
and so there was a real need for some more functional systems

929
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,370
and

930
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,049
and as we filled out the pdp11 line

931
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,049
um

932
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,450
course

933
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,809
the 45 was a pretty big machine

934
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,130
but we filled it out with a lot of other ones to the

935
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,610
the 1140 and 45

936
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:31,529
well

937
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:31,649
yeah

938
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:31,889
the 45

939
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,370
the 1170

940
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,370
um

941
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,010
there was um

942
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,690
a need for some more machines or more operating system capability

943
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,409
that supported a more rich programming and and capability

944
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,929
and so there were several rsx systems

945
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,409
there was rsx1 c

946
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,529
there was rsx1 b

947
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,690
which maybe that that one may have never

948
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:55,769
um

949
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,529
had any body really know much about it

950
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:05,409
but it was basically rs rsx1 c that could load doss 11 files off of the dis

951
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,169
so it was sort of like we can store programs on the dis and run them

952
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,490
but it's still a coreon system

953
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,450
and then rsx1 m and rsx1 d

954
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,450
um

955
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:23,370
the order in which we did these was rsx1 c was done first and then b

956
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:24,529
and when i did b

957
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,450
i said i will do b

958
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,970
but i want you to te

959
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,769
promise me that i don't have to work on this again

960
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,409
and they said okay

961
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,049
so at about that same time

962
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,730
rsx 11d was starting up

963
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,889
which was a an equivalent of rsx uh 15

964
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:45,250
which is the 18-bit real-time system that digital sold

965
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,010
and so i was um assigned to work on that

966
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,450
and there was a fellow named hank cree

967
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,130
which was the main designer of that

968
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,929
because he worked on the r615 and i agreed to do

969
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:00,769
uh

970
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,490
the overlay linker for it

971
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,810
so my involvement when rs r 611d was the overlay linker and when we finished that

972
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:10,849
um

973
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,449
that came out a little bit larger than we hoped

974
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,329
and a little bit slower

975
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:24,369
than we'hoped so i had had had this idea of about building a system with a really different architecture

976
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,409
the r 611d had an architecture where basically everything ran as a process

977
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,969
and doing that meant the drivers ran as processes

978
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,168
which meant that there was an ipc

979
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,530
an interprocess communication mechanism had to exist between the program that wanted the service of a driver

980
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,770
and the driver

981
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,290
which wasn't really

982
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:47,969
uh

983
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,530
conducive to the real-time performance we wanted to have

984
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,449
so i had this other idea of building a system that was a lot different

985
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,010
in fact

986
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,690
it's mostly like

987
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,290
um

988
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,650
the other systems that we built

989
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,890
or i've been involved with

990
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,450
um

991
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,290
so i i proposed building r611 m

992
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,010
and the industrial products group got pretty excited about it

993
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,450
and they gave me i guess about eight people to work on that

994
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:17,369
and we completed that in about a year and a half or two years

995
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,730
and that became the main real-time system for pdp 11s because it would run on all the pdp 11s

996
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,290
the ones that had memory management system

997
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:27,329
uh

998
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,369
memory management units

999
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,170
and the ones that didn't in fact it ran on

1000
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,770
it ran on systems from 32k bytes up to two megabytes

1001
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:36,770
um

1002
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:38,010
a big span

1003
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,210
so this is the first time that you're running a major software project

1004
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:43,570
right

1005
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,570
a major operating system development project

1006
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,570
um

1007
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,089
was this the first time that i was running a major project

1008
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:52,089
um

1009
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,170
probably you would consider that to be the first time of a major project

1010
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,810
because this was something that we're actually going to sell

1011
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,609
we're going to sell rsx 11m

1012
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,490
we're going to have customers

1013
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,369
we're going to have support issues

1014
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,329
and so there's all of that and we're

1015
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,170
we're going to have documentation to do

1016
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,170
um

1017
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,410
the pdp10 system was probably

1018
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,170
um

1019
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,130
not quite as big a project

1020
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,290
but but i was the lead guy there

1021
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:19,569
too

1022
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:21,170
very inexperienced

1023
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,170
um

1024
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,609
i don't know how dupon ever had the faith they had in me to do that

1025
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,450
but um

1026
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,089
they did did

1027
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,089
and i'm thankful they did

1028
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:30,089
so

1029
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,730
rs 611m was really the first

1030
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:35,530
the first time that i did a project

1031
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:36,369
um

1032
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,490
and so i developed around r611 a lot of things about

1033
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:43,930
you know i was

1034
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,050
how are we going to do this

1035
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:45,490
and

1036
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,010
uh

1037
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,130
what

1038
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,730
are we going to do

1039
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,930
and what do we have to do

1040
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,250
and so you know

1041
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,010
one of the first things i wanted to know is what is the scope of work

1042
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,210
what are we going to do

1043
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,210
uh

1044
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,290
you can't just just say we're going to do an operating system

1045
00:36:58,319 --> 00:36:58,930
we ought to know

1046
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,170
well

1047
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,490
what capabilities it's going to have

1048
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,770
what are its constraints

1049
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:06,930
one of the constraints it had was it had to be subset compatible with r 611d

1050
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,970
so it wasn't a blank sheet of paper where we could just go off and do a new system

1051
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:11,890
it was

1052
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:12,890
well

1053
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,010
it has to be subset compatible

1054
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,569
but it's it's source

1055
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,250
level compatible

1056
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,369
not binary compatible

1057
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,450
so that was a big

1058
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,730
um

1059
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,130
a big caveat

1060
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,849
because binary compatibility is much more hard or much harder to achieve

1061
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:27,930
so

1062
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,130
r 611m was really my first

1063
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:30,970
um

1064
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,930
real operating system

1065
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:33,930
um

1066
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,250
from scratch

1067
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,250
i think it took about two years

1068
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:38,930
um

1069
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,890
it was delivered with

1070
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,450
um

1071
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,690
what i think was pretty good quality for the tools and everything we had at that time

1072
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:46,250
um

1073
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,050
my philosophy about quality was quality was number one

1074
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,329
it's still my first thing is quality

1075
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:52,930
number one

1076
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,730
so the

1077
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,810
the size is the gold rubber stamp

1078
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,490
uh

1079
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,730
played into that

1080
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:57,970
or

1081
00:37:59,319 --> 00:37:59,569
um

1082
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:00,569
the

1083
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,130
the one of the big constraints with r611 m was

1084
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:09,170
or one of the big problems with r611 d was it required so much memory

1085
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,250
so with r611 m

1086
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,290
we wanted to build a much smaller system

1087
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:13,730
and

1088
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,690
and i kind of figured out right off the bat

1089
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,450
that the only way to do that was we give everybody a budget

1090
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,329
so everybody had a budget about how much memory they could use

1091
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,569
and you know

1092
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,089
if somebody

1093
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,970
so that was their target

1094
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,130
so if somebody came back and said i can't possibly do that

1095
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,810
and you know whatever the budget was

1096
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,930
then we'd rethink that

1097
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,410
but um

1098
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,329
generally everybody meant their budget

1099
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,930
and so to kind of reinforce that

1100
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,609
every i had this rubber stamp made

1101
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,890
that says size is the goal

1102
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,970
and everything was stamped with size is the goal

1103
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,569
in those days there was no email

1104
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:53,890
so there was no electronic exchange of communication

1105
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,810
so all communication was through memos

1106
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,010
and every memo was stamped with size is the goal

1107
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,450
size is the goal

1108
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,369
so we ended up with

1109
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,810
you know

1110
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,609
in a 32k byte system

1111
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,770
there was 16k bytes for the operating system

1112
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,609
and 16k bytes for whatever the the user environment was or the application environment

1113
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:17,810
there wasn't really user mode and there was user mode and kernel mode

1114
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,410
but these were dedicated systems

1115
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,369
you know it wasn't

1116
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,890
it wasn't a system where

1117
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:24,890
um

1118
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:31,970
there were a lot of people going to use this in a general way it was like this system is dedicated to controlling something in a real-time way

1119
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,930
and and whoever bought the system would write the software that would control their process

1120
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,730
now this is

1121
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:40,730
uh

1122
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,290
where the first dave cutler kernel

1123
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,050
the dck shows up

1124
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,690
you go off and code a big part of the operating system yourself

1125
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,690
uh

1126
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:49,970
well

1127
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,530
all the stuff that i worked on

1128
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,650
i did a lot of it myself

1129
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,210
i

1130
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,569
i did

1131
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,250
um

1132
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,329
going back to pdb1 i did a lot of that myself

1133
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:58,530
in fact

1134
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,089
everything that i've done throughout my career

1135
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:02,089
um

1136
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,650
i've always been a very hands-on person

1137
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,650
um

1138
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,170
i can't just stand back and say

1139
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,290
you know

1140
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,250
this is what we're going to build

1141
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,690
you guys go off and write the specs

1142
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,650
um

1143
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,770
and i'm going to manage you

1144
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,730
i sort of become part of the team

1145
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,450
and i look at myself as more a leader than a manager

1146
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,329
and i want to lead the people to build the product

1147
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,130
and that means i'm a part of that

1148
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,650
and and

1149
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:27,569
um

1150
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,050
there's no job that i can't that i won't do

1151
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,050
um

1152
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,810
i like to have

1153
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,650
i have this little saying

1154
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,530
that the successful people of the world are the people that do the things that the unsuccessful ones won't

1155
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,010
so i've always been this person that you know i i will build the system

1156
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,650
i will fix the bugs

1157
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,650
i will fix other people's bugs

1158
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,250
i will fix bug

1159
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:49,970
uh

1160
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,329
bill breaks

1161
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,329
it's all in part of of um of getting the job done

1162
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:56,329
so

1163
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,410
so

1164
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,410
uh

1165
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,130
the 11s running out of gas deck decides it's time to build a 32-bit computer

1166
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,290
they're behind sds and seal and others in 32 bits

1167
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,890
and a new operating system is needed and vms starts off

1168
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,369
uh

1169
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:16,369
about

1170
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:17,369
um

1171
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,450
i think it was 1975

1172
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,450
digital

1173
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,930
um realized that they needed to build a 32-bit computer

1174
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,890
and so being a part of rs 61m and the 11 world

1175
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:33,329
i

1176
00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:37,170
i kind of got um i got involved in that

1177
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,130
we had several architecture groups

1178
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,770
several levels of architecture group

1179
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,170
there was

1180
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,089
we decided to call this vax

1181
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,730
and vax was a code name

1182
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,650
which stood for virtual address extension

1183
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,569
because the pdp11 had such a small virtual address space

1184
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:52,569
um

1185
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,770
and gordon bell was the the person that was behind this

1186
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,210
it was his vision that we should build this computer

1187
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,130
and vax a was the hardware architecture group and vax b was sort of a review group

1188
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,569
and then i think there was another one called vxi

1189
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,770
which was kind of like the rest of the company

1190
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,690
and i was like a formal member of vax b

1191
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,130
but an informal member of vax a

1192
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,410
also

1193
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,050
so i spent a lot of time on the vax

1194
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:19,410
a

1195
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:20,329
uh

1196
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,770
group

1197
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,650
um

1198
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,849
discussing the computer and whatever

1199
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,690
and we

1200
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,089
bill strucker was involved in this in gordon bell

1201
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,609
this is my first real involvement

1202
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:32,089
gordon

1203
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:33,089
um

1204
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,170
he was definitely at the company all the time i was there

1205
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,690
but this is the first time i was really involved with him and we would meet

1206
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,290
um

1207
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,730
almost every day and talk about this computer and the instruction set and what we should do

1208
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,809
and one of the biggest goals of of vax was to be able to encode a program in the same amount of memory

1209
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,089
that the pdb1 could encode it

1210
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,290
so that sort of dictated it a a instruction set that was pretty dense

1211
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:01,530
um

1212
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,130
the other thing is

1213
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,410
we definitely wanted to

1214
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,010
uh

1215
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:08,329
increase the virtual address space by quite a bit

1216
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,770
and building a 32-bit computer would allow us to do that

1217
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:13,609
and at that time

1218
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,490
like going from 16 to 32 was like man

1219
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,809
how could we ever run out of 32 bits of address space and we'll later on

1220
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:24,250
we'll skip forward and we'll figure out why we did run out of 32 bits

1221
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,250
uh

1222
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:27,369
so the vax

1223
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:28,690
um

1224
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,290
the vax a and the architecture group

1225
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:32,609
um

1226
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,089
basically were

1227
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:34,890
were

1228
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:35,369
uh

1229
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,530
defining the architecture

1230
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,290
and there were

1231
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,250
there were other software people involved

1232
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:40,970
uh

1233
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:43,530
there were some people from the pdp10 group that were involved

1234
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:44,530
uh

1235
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,290
mainly peter conlan

1236
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,770
and we hired a fellow from um zerox

1237
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,609
who had worked at sds

1238
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,410
who had worked on a system called cp5

1239
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,650
which was

1240
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,170
uh

1241
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:56,849
um

1242
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,730
one of the systems that ran on the sigma 5

1243
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,770
it was the operating system of the sigma 5

1244
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,650
his name was dick husett

1245
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,010
this is dick

1246
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:04,690
uh

1247
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:09,250
was involved with vx a and the other person was involved with peter litman

1248
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,569
you know there were some other people

1249
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,970
but we basically developed the architecture and then the company said well

1250
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,290
let's build it

1251
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,690
and and so we sort of said

1252
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:21,329
well

1253
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,369
how long do you want this to be

1254
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:23,809
and they said

1255
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,130
well

1256
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,170
two years seem reasonable

1257
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:25,730
he said

1258
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,329
oh my lord

1259
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:27,730
we can never build this in two years

1260
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,410
this is too complicated of an architecture to build in two years

1261
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,890
so we had

1262
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:32,730
uh

1263
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,730
this off-site one week

1264
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:36,730
uh

1265
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:44,809
come to jesus meeting about what we would do to the architecture to make this system buildable in two years

1266
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,170
and that i think that was called the blue ribbon committee

1267
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:55,210
and there was three software people and three software implementers and three hardware implementers plus some of the architects

1268
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,450
and we hammered out the the final vax architecture

1269
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,450
uh

1270
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,490
which reduced the um

1271
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,130
the complexity of the

1272
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:05,530
the

1273
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,490
the instruction set architecture quite a bit

1274
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,970
i i suspect that people would still say that the instruction said architecture was overly complicated

1275
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,210
but it was really complicated before that

1276
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,450
and

1277
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:17,170
and the other thing

1278
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,130
that happened was the memory management was so complicated

1279
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,770
that the only person that could actually explain it was richie larry

1280
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,250
and everybody else was sort of like

1281
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:25,530
yeah

1282
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,849
that seems like it might work

1283
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,250
but we're not really sure

1284
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,890
and so we really simplified the memory management architecture so

1285
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:36,130
that the hardware architects thought that they could build it efficiently

1286
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,690
and the software people thought that we could build an operating system for it

1287
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,690
and one of the the decisions we made with vax

1288
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:45,809
in fact

1289
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:46,329
we made two

1290
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,770
a couple of decisions with va

1291
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,170
that

1292
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:57,010
that limited the life of vax one was the the encoding of the um instruction stream to be be equivalent to the pb1

1293
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:05,930
which caused it a extremely difficult to um implement hardware system that was mainly in hardware

1294
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,369
and not mainly in micro code

1295
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,609
so the vaac instruction set mostly was executed in micr code and not in hardware

1296
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,650
because it was so hard to to decode

1297
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,170
and the other thing that was u kind of a mistake

1298
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:26,250
a long-term mistake was the page size being 512 bytes versus something more reason able

1299
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,450
like 1k bytes or 4k bytes

1300
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,930
would have been a much better um solution

1301
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:32,609
however

1302
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,410
you know

1303
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,970
we looked at it and the marketing people wanted wanted

1304
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,849
they wanted to sell vac systems that were the size of pdp11 systems in memory

1305
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,690
so they wanted to sell a system that was 128k bytes

1306
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:46,690
well

1307
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,809
the most complicated uh instruction in the vax architecture was adpack

1308
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:51,849
six

1309
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:59,250
that was an ad packed instruction decimal instruction with six operands that could touch 40 pages

1310
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,730
so it became

1311
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,569
if it has to touch 40 pages and you only have 128k bytes

1312
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:07,809
then you don't want to get into a live loock situation

1313
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,650
where the what's going on in the system is such

1314
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,410
that you can never get all the pages in to to actually execute instruction

1315
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,849
so we settled on the 512 byte instruction set

1316
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:22,130
um

1317
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,010
so after the architecture was kind of signed off on and we decided we really want to build it

1318
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,970
we went through the blue ribbon committee

1319
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:31,970
uh

1320
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,609
published the final architectural spec

1321
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,329
then we put together the software group

1322
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,490
and we put together the hardware group to build the hardware and to build the software

1323
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:41,250
and

1324
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,130
um

1325
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,050
i was the technical lead of the software group

1326
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,130
um

1327
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,930
and then we spent

1328
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:49,329
we went off and spent

1329
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,130
um

1330
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,849
i would say six months

1331
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:53,849
uh

1332
00:47:53,859 --> 00:47:56,569
trying to think about and understand and um

1333
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:57,410
how to build the system

1334
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,650
because we were

1335
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,849
we were death afraid of building a paging system

1336
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:05,410
there wasn't a lot of experience on paging systems in those days

1337
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,609
the pdp10 did not have paging

1338
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,690
it had swapping

1339
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:09,690
um

1340
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,650
bbnn

1341
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,890
had built a modification to the pdp10 which had paging

1342
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,450
but you know the sort of the the

1343
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,250
the scuttle butt was

1344
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,250
it didn't run real well

1345
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,690
multic was a paging system and multic did not run well

1346
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,290
i'm not sure that multics would run well on today's hardware

1347
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,290
uh

1348
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,089
it was a great system

1349
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:32,730
it

1350
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:33,089
it

1351
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,410
it spawned a lot of creative ideas

1352
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,450
but it was basically very slow

1353
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,089
anybody that ran on that system

1354
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:42,930
definitely was not concerned about productivity

1355
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,530
so we spent a long time figuring out how we would build this system

1356
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,049
so we thought we would have good performance

1357
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:51,049
um

1358
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,210
we would be able to build it in a couple years and um

1359
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,849
we would have the quality that we wanted to have

1360
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,530
and so after six months we we

1361
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:02,530
we

1362
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:03,049
um

1363
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,970
authored a document called the i think the starlet um design and project plan

1364
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,210
well

1365
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,450
a scarlet project plan and from that we started out and we implemented

1366
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:15,730
um

1367
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:16,930
we implement

1368
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,530
we built

1369
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,089
we implemented

1370
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,130
or well

1371
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:19,369
see

1372
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:28,049
we developed vms mainly on r 611m and um rsx1 m had a little bit

1373
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:30,250
by that time it had a little bit of time sharing capability

1374
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:36,049
so there was multi-use and we had a large um 1170

1375
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:39,329
probably two two megabytes of memory on it

1376
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:40,329
um

1377
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,849
two megabytes

1378
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:43,930
um

1379
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:48,369
so we developed mainly on on r611 m

1380
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,290
but then we ran it on a simulator

1381
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:54,650
the the uh group that actually built the vax 11

1382
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:55,530
uh

1383
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,930
750 was the group that was assigned to build the

1384
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:02,130
the emulator for the for vx

1385
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,170
and we actually had an emulator run on

1386
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,049
which was a hardware emulator

1387
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:06,930
so we had

1388
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:08,329
we didn't run on a simulator

1389
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:13,250
we ran on emulator and um

1390
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,250
uh

1391
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,170
we developed it

1392
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,369
i got it running there

1393
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,290
and then the

1394
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,809
when the hardware

1395
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,770
the breadboard for the 1170 uh was available

1396
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,770
we took the what we had and we went up stairs and um

1397
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,369
it pretty

1398
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:29,130
much ran it

1399
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:29,530
uh

1400
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,650
booted up and

1401
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:31,089
uh

1402
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,650
at least we got to the point where i didn't crash

1403
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,210
so

1404
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,210
um

1405
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,410
that's kind of how how we started

1406
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,210
and then

1407
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,770
from then on we they built a prototype

1408
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:41,690
um

1409
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,089
i think it was proto 4

1410
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,930
and that was our develop machine

1411
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,010
and everybody ran on the develop machine and we ran what we built

1412
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,770
and that was the

1413
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,530
this is the first instance of the dog food thing

1414
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:54,930
mhm

1415
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:57,329
where you run on what you're developing

1416
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,210
and that gives you a big incentive to fix whatever's wrong

1417
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,450
so we would

1418
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:04,089
um

1419
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,170
we're all sitting

1420
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,890
and this was vms

1421
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,410
is a time sharing system

1422
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:09,410
so

1423
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,569
we were all in our offices all close to the machine

1424
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:13,849
and if it crashed

1425
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:15,770
you know dick husett

1426
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:16,890
and peter litman

1427
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,770
and i would go out

1428
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,930
and look to see why it crashed and we'd figure out why it crashed and we reboot

1429
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,809
go back to our office and fix the problem and then go out and reboot a new system

1430
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,290
and then everybody would be with a new system

1431
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,530
so that's sort of how the development of vms occurred and the day we shipped vms

1432
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,530
uh

1433
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,650
we had zero known bugs

1434
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,049
now it was zero known bugs

1435
00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:46,210
that didn't mean there was no bugs

1436
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,170
but there were zero known bugs

1437
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,049
and i know there was a bug right at the very end

1438
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:52,890
where we had a race condition that was fixed

1439
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,170
like in the 11th hour

1440
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,130
um

1441
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,809
in then

1442
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:56,089
the

1443
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,250
the final binaries were submitted to

1444
00:51:59,559 --> 00:51:59,809
uh

1445
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,329
the manufacturing plant

1446
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:08,770
so the vms and the 780 kind of launched deck into the super mini

1447
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,170
bigger applications

1448
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,329
more nudging into the commercial world

1449
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,010
all kinds of new features and requirements coming

1450
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,089
and that spawns a lot of evolution of vms

1451
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,970
so you

1452
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,530
you were with the vms team

1453
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:27,730
well

1454
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,010
all of that

1455
00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:29,569
no

1456
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:30,210
i

1457
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,970
when vms vms was

1458
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,490
um

1459
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,569
what i was my first very difficult project

1460
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,690
where you know

1461
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,369
there were some constraints placed on us that were very

1462
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,170
um

1463
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,490
very hard

1464
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:52,809
we were the two years that we were given to eventually or effectively produce a system of the level

1465
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:55,490
and caliber of ems was very short

1466
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:56,970
um

1467
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,609
and at that point i thought that at the i thought you know

1468
00:53:01,619 --> 00:53:05,130
maybe i should try some other things i'm interested in

1469
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,010
and one of the other

1470
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,450
one of the things i was very interested in was compilers

1471
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:10,450
so

1472
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,130
at the end of vms version one

1473
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:20,130
i decided that i would um start a compiler group to produce a pl1 compiler

1474
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,770
so i really didn't

1475
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:22,369
uh

1476
00:53:22,379 --> 00:53:24,490
continue on with the

1477
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,770
with the the uh

1478
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,130
continuing versions of the ms

1479
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:27,770
i

1480
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,210
i

1481
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,490
uh

1482
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:34,049
split off at that point and started this group of consisting of i think four people

1483
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,690
and i think we grew to about six people to do a pl1 compiler

1484
00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:40,809
and we

1485
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:47,970
we bought a u a front end for the compiler from a company in um boston

1486
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,049
and we produced the back end

1487
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,130
which was the code generator

1488
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,210
and i think that was another two-year project or so

1489
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:55,410
so

1490
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:01,530
and in part of that project also spawned a c compiler for vax also

1491
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:10,609
and this was an example of really eating the dog food of writing the compiler in the compiler in pl1 actually pl1

1492
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:12,089
um

1493
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:14,490
as far as a dog food kind of thing

1494
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:15,049
um

1495
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:16,690
was an interesting way

1496
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,609
we did the compiler

1497
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:18,809
um

1498
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:27,170
we had the front end of the compiler on that was delivered to us on multics and multic

1499
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,410
the first we first thought that what we would do is we would

1500
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,809
we would take the the multic compiler

1501
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,329
and we would compile the pieces of the multic compiler

1502
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,849
and we'd bring them over to vax and run them

1503
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:41,690
eventually

1504
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,650
we tried running the the remotely on the multic system

1505
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,530
and we we couldn't get it to run in full duplex mode

1506
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,730
and this is like got in 100

1507
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:53,010
whatever is 50 miles to boston

1508
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,609
it's 300 b

1509
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,690
so we tried half duplex

1510
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,970
it was a little bit at half duplex

1511
00:54:58,119 --> 00:54:59,770
so we just that wouldn't work either

1512
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:02,930
so we decided what we would do is we'd hire a shuttle service

1513
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:03,930
and

1514
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,130
and the guy that was working on the front end would produce stuff on multics

1515
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,890
put it on mag tape

1516
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,010
give it to the shuttle service

1517
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,410
bring it to deck and we take it off the mag tape

1518
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,809
so the first thing we did was

1519
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:18,530
um

1520
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,809
we did

1521
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:20,809
we

1522
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:24,250
we bootstrapped the compiler backwards

1523
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,130
so we were doing the code generator on our end

1524
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,569
but our

1525
00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:31,089
the code generator was mostly written in assembler

1526
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,089
um

1527
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:33,730
so we got that working

1528
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,609
and then we would bring back the phases of the compiler one by one backwards

1529
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,089
until we got back to the beginning of the compiler

1530
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,569
and then we could compile the whole thing at digital

1531
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,490
so we really were eating our dog fu

1532
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,329
because the whole compiler was written in pl1 except for the

1533
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,210
the

1534
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:57,010
the parts of the code generator that had to run line last

1535
00:55:57,799 --> 00:55:59,049
so you

1536
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:02,089
now we're about 1981 at deck or so

1537
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:02,650
or a little earlier

1538
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:03,329
this is about

1539
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,329
this is about

1540
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:05,930
um

1541
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:06,930
well

1542
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,730
it's yeah

1543
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:09,049
19881

1544
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:10,049
um

1545
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,450
sometime during that year

1546
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:12,650
maybe early in that year

1547
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:18,170
so some circumstances conspire and dave says

1548
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,849
is no longer for me

1549
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:20,849
pardon

1550
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,530
maynard was no longer for you

1551
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,329
so what happened after the pl1 compiler was

1552
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:26,930
um

1553
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,130
um

1554
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,250
you know

1555
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,490
i sort of getting really a little bit fed up with the the growth of digital

1556
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,130
when i started digital

1557
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,450
there was 12, 000 people

1558
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,210
and i don't know

1559
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:38,809
in 8 881

1560
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:41,210
there certainly wasn't 12, 000 anymore

1561
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:43,970
there was 75 75, 000 or something

1562
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:50,289
and so what started out to be this really engineering run engineering

1563
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,970
um environment

1564
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:54,970
um

1565
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,650
suddenly became more of a management

1566
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,930
marketing program

1567
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:01,890
management environment

1568
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,049
which i wasn't too happy with

1569
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:09,849
and so i had expressed some things to gordon about um

1570
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,130
maybe that i would like you know to be somewhere else

1571
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,970
and he had offered to

1572
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:15,890
uh

1573
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,010
he said

1574
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:17,289
well

1575
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:18,250
anywhere you want to go

1576
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:18,809
you know

1577
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:20,569
maybe we can figure out how we can start engineering

1578
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:21,530
uh

1579
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,170
facility there

1580
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:22,890
and i'said well

1581
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,450
i don't know

1582
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,650
maybe maybe i'll be okay here

1583
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:33,410
and then this opportunity came up to start a company that was um going to um

1584
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,849
commercialize a compiler

1585
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:37,010
i'm sorry

1586
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,089
a language that was

1587
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:39,770
uh

1588
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,530
funded by the government for real-time control

1589
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:43,849
which is called praxis

1590
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:45,730
and it was done for lawrence livermore

1591
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:48,569
and it was actually done for the shiva noa project

1592
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:51,569
which was a fusion energy project

1593
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:52,690
um

1594
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,609
so i kind of got enthused about doing that and we we being

1595
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,289
uh

1596
00:57:59,299 --> 00:58:00,329
i guess about six people

1597
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,049
three of us from deck

1598
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,210
and a couple from or four of us from deck and a couple from lawrence livermore

1599
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:07,170
you know

1600
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,809
traveled around the

1601
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,170
the

1602
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:09,809
the

1603
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,089
the bay area looking for money

1604
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:14,369
and

1605
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:15,369
uh

1606
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:16,890
we sort of got to the point

1607
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:20,849
where i think we figured out that maybe this wasn't the right thing to do

1608
00:58:20,859 --> 00:58:22,970
or at least i figured out this wasn't the right thing to do

1609
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:24,450
and so i had

1610
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:24,690
i

1611
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:24,809
we

1612
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,890
i told digital

1613
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:27,170
i'm leaving

1614
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,010
and so

1615
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,010
um

1616
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,329
you know

1617
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:31,650
gez

1618
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,650
we had a termination date and everything

1619
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,010
and and then all of a sudden i think

1620
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,450
oh

1621
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,010
well

1622
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,569
i'm not sure this is going to work out

1623
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,089
you know

1624
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:41,329
um

1625
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:46,369
the president of the company was going to be a guy from the shiven noa project

1626
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,010
and he seemed to be more interested in how he was going to spend all of our seed money

1627
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:57,130
which we had put up ourselves on things like his color and his wife

1628
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:57,849
uh

1629
00:58:57,859 --> 00:59:00,930
paying his wife for our stationary

1630
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,329
so suddenly all our money that we'put together was gone

1631
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:04,970
and i'm thinking

1632
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:05,369
wow

1633
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,770
i don't know if i want to go with this guy

1634
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,170
so at the last moment i said

1635
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,410
no

1636
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,130
i'm not going to do it so effectively

1637
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:14,690
all the other deck guys says

1638
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:14,890
well

1639
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,890
we're not doing it either

1640
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,410
so then became the question about

1641
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:20,210
well

1642
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,210
gez

1643
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,130
what are you going to do

1644
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,730
and so i said

1645
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:24,089
well

1646
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:24,450
you know

1647
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:31,530
i think i think it's really appropriate that i think about being somewhere else where i'm kind of isolated

1648
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:34,490
a little bit from a little smaller environment

1649
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:38,930
where we don't have all of the bureaucracy or we're developing a deck

1650
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:40,490
so gordon says

1651
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:40,809
well

1652
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,490
geez that's sounds good to me

1653
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,650
let's where would you like to go

1654
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:44,049
and i said

1655
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:44,849
well

1656
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:46,609
can't be on the east coast

1657
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,809
because that won't be far enough

1658
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:49,930
you know

1659
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,010
i really don't really like the southwest too much

1660
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:53,970
so maybe you know

1661
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,049
like arizona in new mexico

1662
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,450
probably texas is not a good place

1663
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,289
probably the west coast would be the best place

1664
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:00,490
well

1665
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,369
gordon says you know the west coast would be fine

1666
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,049
but i want you to be somewhere where there's a a university that's got a good computer science program

1667
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:09,049
uh

1668
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:10,450
so that we can draw people from there

1669
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,210
and maybe we can

1670
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,170
we can actually collaborate with the

1671
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:13,650
with the

1672
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,609
the university

1673
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,970
so the deck

1674
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:18,770
um

1675
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:23,250
real estate department arranged this trip

1676
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,250
where we would fly to several different places on the west coast and look at

1677
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:27,690
and we

1678
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,690
we went to um

1679
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,210
went to san francisco

1680
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,369
we went to um sacramento

1681
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:35,369
um

1682
01:00:35,379 --> 01:00:37,650
they were really hot on santa rosa

1683
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:44,690
we went to portland and we came to seattle and i had spent a little time in portland

1684
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:45,930
a little earlier

1685
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,530
in fact

1686
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,490
what had spawned the earlier

1687
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,930
the earlier um offer by gordon to um

1688
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,650
to um

1689
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,930
establish a engineering facility for me

1690
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:03,089
was that i had actually interview interviewed at intel in portland

1691
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,809
and which is kind of an interesting

1692
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,049
this is kind of a backtrack

1693
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,210
but let me go back and talk about that

1694
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:09,890
just for a second

1695
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,049
this happened

1696
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,970
and and i interviewed and they were building

1697
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:13,450
uh

1698
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,690
the 432 at that time

1699
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,130
which was their 32-bit computer

1700
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,130
um

1701
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:20,130
which eventually never ever materialized

1702
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:21,049
but

1703
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:21,569
um

1704
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:23,609
we had lost a couple people

1705
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,329
dave best

1706
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,289
who had been the program manager for the 750 went there

1707
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:29,289
so i interviewed out there

1708
01:01:29,299 --> 01:01:33,329
and they got to the point of they were going to offer me a a job and they said

1709
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:33,530
well

1710
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,289
we can't really offer you a job because we're

1711
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,130
we really cooperate a lot with digital

1712
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,369
and you've got to tell gordon bell that you're going to

1713
01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:40,809
you're interested in this

1714
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:41,130
so i said

1715
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:41,730
no problem

1716
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:43,410
so we're at spit book road

1717
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,010
i call up gordon

1718
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:44,690
i said gordon

1719
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:48,809
i just i've been interviewing with intel and i don't really want their job

1720
01:01:48,819 --> 01:01:49,170
but i

1721
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:49,369
you know

1722
01:01:49,379 --> 01:01:53,690
i want their offer because i want to figure out how much i'm worth

1723
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,289
i said

1724
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:55,730
okay

1725
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:56,730
you

1726
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:57,210
okay with that

1727
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:57,930
he saysure

1728
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,289
and i hung up and about 15 minutes later the phone rings and it's larry partners

1729
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,770
admin said larry and gordon would like to come up to spit brook and have lunch with you

1730
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:09,849
i said

1731
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:10,089
oh

1732
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:10,450
that's fine

1733
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:10,770
when

1734
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:12,170
today

1735
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:13,770
will that be okay

1736
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,210
and i said

1737
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:14,450
sure

1738
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:15,170
so they

1739
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:20,369
they came to to spit brook and said we went to lunch and they basically said

1740
01:02:20,379 --> 01:02:20,609
well

1741
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:20,770
why

1742
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:21,730
why do you want to leave

1743
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,049
and i said

1744
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:22,250
well

1745
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,089
i i don't want to leave

1746
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:27,569
i just want to know what my value is in the market

1747
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:28,690
they said

1748
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,130
oh

1749
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,130
well

1750
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,089
maybe we can work something out

1751
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,650
and then that's when gordon said

1752
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:35,130
i said i really like portland

1753
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:35,890
and gordon said

1754
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:36,130
well

1755
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:36,690
maybe we

1756
01:02:36,839 --> 01:02:38,609
we can think about this

1757
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,170
and so you know

1758
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,170
we did something about the the salary thing

1759
01:02:44,279 --> 01:02:47,369
and we did something about stock options and we thought about that a little bit

1760
01:02:47,379 --> 01:02:47,809
then i said

1761
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:48,089
hey

1762
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,329
i don't really want to do that

1763
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,010
i

1764
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:50,250
i

1765
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:50,490
i'm

1766
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:55,010
i'll stay here for a while and then this other company opportunity came up and then

1767
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,010
when that fell through

1768
01:02:56,119 --> 01:02:57,049
it was really like

1769
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,690
i really do want to move

1770
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,650
so anyway

1771
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:00,809
we're back to the west coast

1772
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:08,329
we're going down the west coast and we go everywhere and we come to seattle and it's raining

1773
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:10,490
but everything's green

1774
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,010
and i said

1775
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:12,490
gee boy

1776
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,329
this is really a nice place and we visited the university

1777
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:16,490
we we talked to

1778
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:17,329
uh

1779
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:18,809
the head of the computer

1780
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,849
the chairman of the computer science department

1781
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:22,970
i forget what his name was

1782
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:23,690
um

1783
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,130
he was really interested in his coming

1784
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:31,369
and so we went back home and we thought about it for a while and and said you know

1785
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,369
seattle's got to be the place that's got to be the place

1786
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:38,170
so that's how we ended up in seattle

1787
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:39,170
um

1788
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,770
sort of we took the trip and looked at some different places

1789
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:43,849
and

1790
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:44,849
uh

1791
01:03:44,859 --> 01:03:47,450
decided we didn't really like sacramento very well

1792
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:48,450
um

1793
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,130
the barrier was a little bit too busy for us

1794
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:51,930
um

1795
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,890
and belleview was a pretty nice place to be

1796
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,289
so that's where we ended up

1797
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:56,970
so here you are

1798
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,490
so a number of people decided to come with you

1799
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,609
and then some other folks were hired here locally

1800
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,490
you started up a lab

1801
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:04,490
uh

1802
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:04,930
it

1803
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:05,450
we

1804
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,089
we came here and

1805
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:07,690
uh

1806
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:08,450
we brought

1807
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:10,569
um

1808
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:15,289
i guess about eight people with us and we hired

1809
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:16,410
you know

1810
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,170
one of the things was

1811
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,770
we would like to hire some people from the university of washington to to fir

1812
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,250
uh

1813
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,930
to firm up that that um connection of university of washington

1814
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,010
we hired a couple people

1815
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:26,809
um

1816
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:28,170
from there

1817
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:28,849
and

1818
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,210
uh

1819
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,770
started on a project to our our charter

1820
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:36,490
by the way for this was to produce um again

1821
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,770
going back to the real-time roots to produce some uh software for embedded

1822
01:04:41,279 --> 01:04:41,529
uh

1823
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:47,289
chip-based back systems we were working on a chip set at that time called scorpio

1824
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:48,289
uh

1825
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,170
which by today standards would have been huge because it was six chips

1826
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:52,130
um

1827
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:55,849
i think three of them were custom custom vsi chips

1828
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,089
so it was a you

1829
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:57,529
it was a big

1830
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,289
would been big compared to today

1831
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:02,690
but it was very small compared to what we had in those days

1832
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,490
so our charter was to build um

1833
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,329
this runtime system

1834
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:12,890
our little real-time operating system

1835
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,650
which was very easy to program

1836
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:16,650
and

1837
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:17,490
uh

1838
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,890
which was very easy to um

1839
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,930
implement real-time applications

1840
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,130
and the name of the system was back salon and

1841
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:26,690
um

1842
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:27,650
it was our

1843
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,210
it was my first entry or our first entry

1844
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:34,250
into multi-threading we actually did multi-threading in back salon

1845
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:40,089
which is about the same time that mach was doing multi-threading on um

1846
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,490
at carnegie melon

1847
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,849
just about the same time

1848
01:05:44,599 --> 01:05:49,650
so we got partway through this project and we start thinking about

1849
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:49,930
well

1850
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:53,650
scorpio has been going for quite a few years

1851
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,010
now

1852
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,130
we don't know when it's going to be delivered

1853
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:58,130
um

1854
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,650
we don't really have any suitable platform to run this on

1855
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:03,650
uh

1856
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,730
maybe we should think about

1857
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:05,730
uh

1858
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:09,770
what we should do to to vax to maybe make vax a smaller architecture

1859
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,010
so we started an effort

1860
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,010
uh

1861
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:15,569
within the company called microvax

1862
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,410
and which was to trim down the architecture

1863
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,450
and then

1864
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:21,970
later on

1865
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,730
after we had developed the architecture

1866
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:25,049
we thought

1867
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:25,529
well

1868
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,250
we still don't have any platform to run this on

1869
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,650
because we're going to have to produce a chip for this

1870
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,809
and there was a micras chip

1871
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:38,930
so maybe we should start a hardware group here too and we should produce a uh

1872
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,650
an implementation of microa

1873
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,529
that would not be one chip

1874
01:06:45,279 --> 01:06:46,809
but it would be a small system

1875
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,690
maybe the size of a pp105

1876
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,250
so we brought some more people out from deck east

1877
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:59,250
um for the hardware project and

1878
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,730
and they were mainly people from the east

1879
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:02,329
but we also hired

1880
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:03,529
we hired

1881
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:04,369
uh

1882
01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:05,089
i

1883
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:06,569
guess three people locally

1884
01:07:08,119 --> 01:07:08,369
um

1885
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:09,970
because there was a lot of

1886
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:11,770
there's a lot of going on in this area

1887
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:12,890
um

1888
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,130
with electronics

1889
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,450
so it was easy to hire a few people and to produce a m theu microa r

1890
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:20,930
we actually shipped

1891
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:21,730
uh

1892
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,490
velon and microa one together

1893
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:31,210
and i got very interested in hardware at that time and i ended up working on vac salon

1894
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,650
pretty much writing the kernel and the other people wrote the pieces

1895
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:37,650
the file system and the pieces that went around it

1896
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,890
but then i switched to the hardware group for the microx one and wrote all the micro code

1897
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,609
and somewhere along the way

1898
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:46,609
you hooked up with carver

1899
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,049
me and took the team to learn

1900
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:50,130
learn how to do that

1901
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:50,809
the way that we

1902
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:51,490
uh

1903
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,010
implemented the microx one

1904
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,490
uh system was

1905
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:55,089
um

1906
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,289
gordon thought it would be a good idea if we tried

1907
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,170
uh

1908
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:06,849
some new technology with respect to producing silicon chips and one of the new technologies that was being touted

1909
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,089
by carver me from

1910
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:09,770
uh

1911
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:11,369
was he from caltech tech

1912
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:12,369
um

1913
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:12,970
and linn conway

1914
01:08:13,359 --> 01:08:13,609
was

1915
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:14,569
um

1916
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:16,290
some um

1917
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:17,890
silicon piler tools

1918
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:18,649
and there

1919
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:22,130
the company that was founded actually called silicon compilers

1920
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,488
that kid was a principal in and john hennessy was also

1921
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:30,009
and we got together with them

1922
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:38,609
and inspected a chip that they could build that would be the central processing unit of the system

1923
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,729
and it would be on one chip

1924
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:43,250
and so that's

1925
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:44,850
they produced the chip

1926
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:45,850
um

1927
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,330
they designed the chip

1928
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:49,330
uh

1929
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:52,049
jointly with our specifications going back and forth

1930
01:08:52,059 --> 01:08:54,009
they didn't have the all the expert expertise

1931
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:54,770
and then our hardware

1932
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,408
guys designed all the hardware that went around that

1933
01:08:58,158 --> 01:08:58,408
uh

1934
01:08:58,419 --> 01:09:02,130
we had a an awful time getting the the chip built

1935
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:02,890
we

1936
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,529
we went to a company called ami to start with

1937
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,250
which you know

1938
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:07,890
in those days

1939
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,810
um semiconductor companies were popping up like um dandel lines

1940
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:15,089
there were lots of them

1941
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:16,089
um

1942
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:17,290
they'd pop up

1943
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,250
they'd run through their vc funding

1944
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,850
they'd lie over

1945
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,689
roll over and play dead

1946
01:09:24,839 --> 01:09:28,810
ami never actually produced a chip for us that worked

1947
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,890
they produced a chip and we got the chip

1948
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,488
when we looked at it and they had done all the masks backwards

1949
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,890
they were all the negative of what they should be

1950
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:39,130
oops

1951
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:40,370
oops

1952
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,250
so i don't know how that happened

1953
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:48,170
so we went to another company called seik and seek actually produced the chip

1954
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:49,609
um

1955
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:51,609
i can't remember us

1956
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:52,969
um

1957
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,489
having any problems with the chip with respect to arata

1958
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:01,489
um

1959
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,610
you know

1960
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,969
there may have been some things that we worked

1961
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,370
i

1962
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:04,810
i don't really

1963
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:05,489
i don't really remember

1964
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,370
i remember it being pretty much bug free

1965
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:16,570
and we were um able to take that chip and we put it in a cubus based system

1966
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,690
and that was microx one and we ran velan on it

1967
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,850
but later on we also ran vi a mess on it

1968
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:23,770
um

1969
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:29,210
partway through the microvax um architecture discussion

1970
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:35,010
we had trimmed the memory management capabilities of um vms

1971
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:35,929
quite a bit

1972
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:36,489
i'm not vms

1973
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,890
the the ar

1974
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,770
the memory management capabilities of v

1975
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:40,730
way down

1976
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,489
which meant that vms would not run with it

1977
01:10:43,499 --> 01:10:46,050
it would have to be big modification to vms to make it run

1978
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,449
and so i was writing the micro code and i was thinking

1979
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,090
geez

1980
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,370
why don't we just do the full memory management

1981
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,290
not much micro code

1982
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,810
so i got bob sutnik to agree to that

1983
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,489
he was the guy that was doing the micro code for the microx one chip

1984
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,850
that we just do the whole thing

1985
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,489
it was going to be less work to do that than not do it

1986
01:11:08,499 --> 01:11:09,850
and we get the ms to run

1987
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,090
so we got vms to run almost at the same time

1988
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:17,330
we got our our system to run

1989
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:18,850
and um

1990
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:19,210
i

1991
01:11:19,220 --> 01:11:20,449
i don't remember exactly the year

1992
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:22,290
it was probably 86 or something

1993
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:22,650
84

1994
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:23,370
maybe 84

1995
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:25,409
about 3 years

1996
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,409
maybe three years in development for that system

1997
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,370
um

1998
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:30,370
so

1999
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:30,890
uh

2000
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,489
that was our first project at at deck west

2001
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,850
and where did that lead to

2002
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:36,850
well

2003
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:37,290
that led

2004
01:11:37,639 --> 01:11:37,889
what

2005
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,449
what did that lead to that led to problems that led to big problems

2006
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,650
because here we are

2007
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,050
we have

2008
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:46,929
now we have this kind of seasoned operating system group

2009
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,370
we have the seasoned hardware group

2010
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:50,330
now

2011
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:51,130
what are we going to do

2012
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:56,850
and so the problem is to try to find something to do that's not being done

2013
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:59,010
by another group at headquarters

2014
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,610
and so we went through several proposals on building projects

2015
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:05,489
uh

2016
01:12:05,499 --> 01:12:06,210
building systems

2017
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:08,290
um

2018
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:09,290
um

2019
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,610
hardware was mainly hardware

2020
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:12,610
uh

2021
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:13,969
there were some people at deck west

2022
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:14,489
uh

2023
01:12:14,499 --> 01:12:16,570
that wanted to build um

2024
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:18,250
a workstation

2025
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:19,250
um

2026
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:24,210
and then there were some people that that wanted to build a more capable system than the workstation

2027
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:26,250
and

2028
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:27,250
uh

2029
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:31,570
we ended up not building the workstation and we ended up trying to build a bigger system

2030
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:32,850
and

2031
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:33,850
um

2032
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,130
that led to big problems

2033
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:36,770
because we were always over the top

2034
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,889
we're always duplicating some function

2035
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:41,050
that or some

2036
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:41,810
uh

2037
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:47,489
part of the the uh price performance space that somebody at at headquarters was already doing

2038
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,770
so we went through several projects

2039
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:51,210
um

2040
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:52,650
trying to

2041
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:53,290
uh

2042
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,170
find the right vac to build

2043
01:12:56,679 --> 01:12:58,690
and we basically we would go

2044
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,530
i would go back to mayard and try to negotiate

2045
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:02,530
um

2046
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,130
what we should build

2047
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,969
and get some degree of buying

2048
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,850
and come back and we work for six months and then mayard would decide

2049
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:11,130
well

2050
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,210
that wasn't what they want us to build

2051
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:13,610
so we have to find something else to build

2052
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,770
so this sort of led to us

2053
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:16,409
um

2054
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,810
thinking about risk was becoming very popular at that time

2055
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,810
and it was kind of u getting to the point

2056
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,530
where there's a lot of publicity about risk having better performance in vaac

2057
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:27,889
and risk was the way to go

2058
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,969
and so we got interested in risk and

2059
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:31,489
um

2060
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,570
there were several risk projects going on in the company

2061
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,489
there was one going on in marlboro

2062
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:38,489
uh

2063
01:13:38,499 --> 01:13:41,290
there was one going on down in the bay area at wrl

2064
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,530
which was a western research lab and we were sort of working on one

2065
01:13:46,639 --> 01:13:46,889
so

2066
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:47,530
um

2067
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:48,250
jack smith

2068
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:49,690
who was the uh

2069
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,130
senior vice president of engineering

2070
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:52,130
said

2071
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:52,889
deck west

2072
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:55,090
is respons responsible for the risk architecture

2073
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,570
so there started the prism project

2074
01:13:58,320 --> 01:13:58,810
which was

2075
01:13:59,239 --> 01:13:59,489
um

2076
01:13:59,499 --> 01:14:01,650
a new risk architecture for deck

2077
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,330
and i think we probably started that in about um

2078
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:05,929
85

2079
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:09,210
i think maybe 85

2080
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,210
so

2081
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:12,290
um

2082
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:14,850
that's what happened after we

2083
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,290
we were

2084
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:15,730
we

2085
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:16,730
very successful in being

2086
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:17,050
i

2087
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:17,170
me

2088
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:18,570
just tremendously successful

2089
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,370
you know

2090
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:19,929
very low overhead

2091
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:21,770
very few people

2092
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:22,770
um

2093
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,170
we got things done in just record speed record for record amount of money

2094
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:28,610
engineering

2095
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,690
nre costs were like zilo compared to the other projects

2096
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:38,090
but then into a period of not being able to find the right thing to do

2097
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:39,570
and then into the architecture

2098
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:41,810
the new architecture

2099
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:42,969
all right

2100
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:43,210
so

2101
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:43,770
um

2102
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,090
i guess it was kind of a a risk war

2103
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:51,130
that started to evolve that de between various parts of the company

2104
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:51,929
well

2105
01:14:51,939 --> 01:14:56,010
the reason that the prism archit ecture actually got assigned to deck west

2106
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,330
was

2107
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:02,889
because there were so many uh projects going on in the company trying to develop risk projects

2108
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,489
or risk architectures

2109
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,330
and of course digital already had

2110
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:07,770
we know

2111
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,929
we had the 36-bit line

2112
01:15:08,939 --> 01:15:11,290
which is a pdp 10 and then the dex system 20

2113
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:12,409
we had the vax line

2114
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,489
we had the pdp1 line

2115
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:15,489
um

2116
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,409
i don't think we were probably making any nines and 15s

2117
01:15:18,679 --> 01:15:21,650
we may may have still been shipping a few eights by by then

2118
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:27,050
but um so we really didn't need three or four new risk architectures

2119
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,530
so the prism architecture started out much like the vax architecture

2120
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,010
with representatives from um

2121
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:34,570
vms

2122
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:36,530
had a representative hudson

2123
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,330
which was

2124
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:38,730
the semiconductor branch

2125
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:39,690
had a a representative

2126
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:40,650
uh

2127
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:41,610
marlboro had a representative

2128
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,210
one of the guys that worked on that architecture was there

2129
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:47,290
we had um um myself

2130
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:50,130
and then we had a guy from the architecture group

2131
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,170
and we then spent the next three years

2132
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,010
um

2133
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,570
just about three years

2134
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:57,570
uh

2135
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,770
going through a revision of this

2136
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:04,210
and then taking it back to the senior technical community and they would look at it and say

2137
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:04,370
oh

2138
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:06,570
we don't like this and we would go back we went

2139
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:09,570
we flipped from 64 to 32 to 64

2140
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,889
back to 32 in the architecture

2141
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,610
which it took a long time to sort through all that

2142
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:15,969
and then

2143
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,650
and then you know

2144
01:16:17,660 --> 01:16:22,290
the whole principle of risk was to produce a hard or a

2145
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,889
a system architecture that was easy to implement

2146
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:25,889
um

2147
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,610
you didn't have to have

2148
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:28,409
uh

2149
01:16:28,419 --> 01:16:33,530
brute brute force methods of doing things and massive

2150
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:34,449
uh

2151
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:36,290
verification suites

2152
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,290
um

2153
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,530
and but then the the company kind of ran off the track and started adding all these things

2154
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:45,250
the first thing that happened is we got to have vector arithmetic

2155
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:46,690
so you have to

2156
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,929
we have to compete with sear c

2157
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:50,929
so we had to have a vector architecture

2158
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:51,489
well

2159
01:16:51,499 --> 01:16:52,489
sear probably had

2160
01:16:53,239 --> 01:16:53,570
you know

2161
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,889
he probably had eight vector instructions

2162
01:16:55,199 --> 01:16:55,449
well

2163
01:16:55,459 --> 01:16:57,290
we had to have 150 vector instructions

2164
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:57,969
you know

2165
01:16:58,040 --> 01:16:58,290
so

2166
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,610
and they had to be long vectors

2167
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:00,690
they weren't short vectors

2168
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,770
and so this went on and on and on

2169
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:05,929
and you know

2170
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:07,170
at the meantime

2171
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:08,690
at deck west

2172
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,530
we're sort of um gearing up

2173
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,570
you think that we'd be in a holding pattern

2174
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:14,210
but we're not

2175
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:16,850
we're sort of gearing up for building one of these systems

2176
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,889
and we have proposals for building these systems

2177
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:25,330
and we took microx one and we actually converted it to be to run prism code

2178
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,969
so people could actually develop software

2179
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:29,210
and

2180
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,210
um

2181
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:32,090
we came to a point where

2182
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:38,650
finally the company just said we're canceling prison and i went through

2183
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:39,650
uh

2184
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:39,969
several

2185
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:41,690
we went through a lot of iterations

2186
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:42,530
i'd go to

2187
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:43,409
i'd go to maynard

2188
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:46,850
try to try to get some consensus on what we should be doing

2189
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:50,770
i'd come back home and invariably it was always something bigger

2190
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,730
and we add we'd add people

2191
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,570
so we kind of grew from you

2192
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:56,170
like 20 people to 180 people

2193
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,090
so we have this 180 people organization

2194
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:05,449
and we're building kind of a nebulous project or nebulous product built based on this new architecture

2195
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,250
at a time when the company was trying to build three of these machines

2196
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:15,370
there was one in marlboro and one in um littleton and one seattle

2197
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,690
so our machine got cancelled and our system got

2198
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:19,929
can

2199
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,290
our operating system which called micah got cancelled and i sort of got

2200
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:25,010
i

2201
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:28,130
i kind of went through the the stages of

2202
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:29,969
um

2203
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:31,090
you know

2204
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,690
trying to find some ground where we could all agree on what we're going to build

2205
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,370
come back

2206
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,969
i'd sell the people on it and then they get disappointed

2207
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,290
so i said i don't want to do this again

2208
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,170
so i said what am i going to do

2209
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:42,570
and i said

2210
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:44,570
well

2211
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,250
i guess i'll form a company

2212
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,370
so i got three other guys and i together these are the same three guys we met with

2213
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:54,730
i was talking earlier about bomber

2214
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,330
which we'll get into later and we decided we were going to build

2215
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:02,290
or we were going to form a company to build servers and

2216
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:02,810
um

2217
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:03,929
i formally quit

2218
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,690
although i didn't leave right away

2219
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,290
they gave me an office somewhere else until i had really subtle things

2220
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:12,730
i spent a lot of time traveling back and forth to the the valley

2221
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:13,449
uh

2222
01:19:13,459 --> 01:19:15,969
talking to the vc and what we're doing and whatever

2223
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,130
and we actually got to the point where

2224
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,130
um

2225
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,489
we had the vc all lined up

2226
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:23,330
we we had

2227
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,170
um

2228
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,290
we had 3 vc and myips

2229
01:19:26,639 --> 01:19:28,050
they were all going to put up some seed money

2230
01:19:28,060 --> 01:19:30,650
we're going to have a million dollars worth of seed money

2231
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,530
which um was probably quite a bit of money in today's dollars

2232
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,409
and this was

2233
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,449
this would have been in 1988

2234
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:40,770
so

2235
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:42,330
um

2236
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,250
somewhere during this period

2237
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,850
quite a few of the people

2238
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:51,889
when prison was canceled had decided that maybe they'd look across the street at microsoft and go to microsoft

2239
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:53,770
and one of the people went over there

2240
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:54,770
had

2241
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,850
um been talking to

2242
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:58,330
uh

2243
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,810
bill bill gates about

2244
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:00,730
uh

2245
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:01,489
the group at micro

2246
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,610
or group at deck west and that we had a good operating system group

2247
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:08,489
and maybe that would be something that that he might be interested in

2248
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:09,530
so

2249
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:10,530
um

2250
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:11,929
there was an interview arranged

2251
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,050
and i went over

2252
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:17,850
and talked to bill about what they were interested in doing and what they wanted to do

2253
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,010
and and um

2254
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,170
see if i was interested

2255
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,250
and and they

2256
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:23,170
their

2257
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:23,850
uh

2258
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:30,010
basic concern was that intel was not bringing the the x86 architecture forward fast enough

2259
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,449
and that risk processors were going to overtake them

2260
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,489
and if risk processors overtake them

2261
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:41,130
then all the pc software that they developed would be wouldn't be valuable anymore

2262
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,090
and that they ought to have something going on in risk

2263
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,370
and if they were going to have something going on in risk

2264
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,570
then they needed a new operating system that wasn't written in assembler

2265
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,969
that was written in a portable language so that they could run across several different architectures

2266
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,690
and so i sort of listened to all of this

2267
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,290
and and um was really interested in doing my own company

2268
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,570
and so i kind of left the interview thinking well

2269
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,330
i don't think i'm real real interested in this

2270
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,050
and sort of you know

2271
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:14,290
time

2272
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:14,770
kind of

2273
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:15,570
i don't know

2274
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,250
over a couple months

2275
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,850
we mold us all over the four of us

2276
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:19,330
and

2277
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,330
and

2278
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:20,810
um

2279
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,250
finally we got all the dc lined up and

2280
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:26,969
um

2281
01:21:27,719 --> 01:21:28,170
we got

2282
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,810
we got the commitment from for the money

2283
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,370
and before we were

2284
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:34,850
we got the commitment

2285
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:36,370
um

2286
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:37,489
boy

2287
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:39,210
you listen to them talk

2288
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,530
we were the greatest people in the world but as soon as we got the commitment

2289
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:42,969
our

2290
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:48,330
our value seemed to diminish a little bit and they were a little bit more vocal about

2291
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:49,290
um

2292
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,810
whether or not we could actually run a company or not

2293
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,489
whether we'd be able to to develop a product

2294
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,090
even though we had a good history of product development

2295
01:21:56,840 --> 01:22:00,090
so i think sort of got under my skin a little bit

2296
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,570
and about the same time

2297
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:02,889
steve bomber

2298
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:03,889
who

2299
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:04,570
uh

2300
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,449
worked at microsoft and he

2301
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:06,969
uh

2302
01:22:06,979 --> 01:22:11,650
was the head of the finance department of microsoft called and said

2303
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:12,210
uh

2304
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:13,050
you know

2305
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:13,370
how are

2306
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:13,810
what are you thinking

2307
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:14,449
and i said

2308
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:14,730
well

2309
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:15,530
i'm thinking that we're

2310
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:15,969
you know

2311
01:22:15,979 --> 01:22:20,250
we're really close to doing this company and and we're probably going to turn down the

2312
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:20,449
or

2313
01:22:20,459 --> 01:22:22,050
i'm probably going to turn down the microsoft offer

2314
01:22:22,060 --> 01:22:22,449
and he said

2315
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:22,929
oh geez

2316
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:23,290
uh

2317
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,810
won't you give me a chance to to convince you otherwise

2318
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:26,449
and i said

2319
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:26,730
well

2320
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:26,969
yeah

2321
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:27,290
okay

2322
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:27,730
he said

2323
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:27,969
well

2324
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:30,010
how about how about breakfast at denny's

2325
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:30,889
you know

2326
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:31,610
on saturday morning

2327
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:33,449
at 7 o'clock or i don't

2328
01:22:33,459 --> 01:22:34,449
maybe it was a sunday morning

2329
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:34,850
i mean

2330
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,170
but it was early and i said

2331
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:37,449
yeah

2332
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:37,810
okay

2333
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,210
so the four of us went to denny's and and sat down

2334
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,250
and and steve is

2335
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,929
is such an energetic guy and and um

2336
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,170
a positive thinker and

2337
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:52,170
so he starts the sales job

2338
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:52,489
and

2339
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:53,730
um

2340
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:54,409
i guess

2341
01:22:54,419 --> 01:22:57,090
the best way thing you can say is he fleeced this

2342
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:58,090
because

2343
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:58,969
by the time we left

2344
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:01,730
we're all ready to sign up and we did

2345
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,130
we

2346
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:03,929
we decided not to form our company

2347
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:07,010
which i think was a great looking back on it

2348
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:07,850
uh

2349
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:09,409
we would have been just another server company

2350
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:09,810
probably

2351
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:10,170
unless

2352
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,290
unless we could have

2353
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:12,290
uh

2354
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,050
developed some

2355
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:14,050
in fact

2356
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:14,489
we were

2357
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:15,290
we were

2358
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:15,530
really

2359
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:17,090
um

2360
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,850
founding was a hardware company

2361
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:26,850
and unless we would have had the foresight to convert that company quickly to a software company

2362
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,570
we would have been in trouble

2363
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:29,489
so

2364
01:23:30,199 --> 01:23:30,449
um

2365
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:36,650
in fact we were an interesting thing you might find interesting here is we actually were going to run unix on on this box

2366
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:42,370
because of the lead time that would take to actually produce something of your own

2367
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,050
and the fact that it would be incompatible with everything

2368
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,010
so obviously we couldn't produce something that's vx compatible

2369
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:49,610
so the next best thing was unix

2370
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,010
and we decided that mach was the best example le of unic systems

2371
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:55,889
they're actually going to use mock on this server

2372
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:02,250
but anyway bomber fleeces us and we all decide to sign up and go to work for microsoft

2373
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,130
and so you know

2374
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,690
i quit immediately

2375
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:08,409
they're still working for for deak

2376
01:24:09,159 --> 01:24:10,010
and you know

2377
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:10,130
i

2378
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:10,250
like

2379
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:12,650
i quit on friday and join microsoft on monday

2380
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,290
and the following monday

2381
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,210
these other three guys follow me and then from there

2382
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,210
um

2383
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:20,770
we

2384
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:21,770
we

2385
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:22,250
i

2386
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,370
i want to say we recruited because we didn't really recruit people

2387
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,290
but people ask us about opportunities

2388
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,250
and of course we're forthcoming about opportunities

2389
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,770
so we managed to bring over quite a few people

2390
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:35,130
we

2391
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:41,369
and part of the thing about going to microsoft was they wanted the portable operating system

2392
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,570
but i liked the hardware part of it too

2393
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:44,250
having that

2394
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:44,530
so

2395
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:45,489
uh

2396
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:46,250
we convinced them

2397
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,929
or i convinced them that that i should have a hardware group

2398
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:52,969
and the software group and that we would produce the hardware

2399
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:53,570
produce

2400
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,969
hardware group would actually produce the first risk-based pc

2401
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,250
that the software group would be producing the operating system for

2402
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,690
so we were able to bring over

2403
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,010
i'm sorry we weren't able to bring over

2404
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,929
we were able to to

2405
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:10,409
uh

2406
01:25:10,419 --> 01:25:11,409
satisfy the

2407
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,570
i think the statute of limitations is long past the statute of limit

2408
01:25:15,159 --> 01:25:15,650
long past

2409
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:18,090
we were able to bring over these people from from deck

2410
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:18,929
that had been

2411
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:19,770
you know

2412
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:21,690
the top performers at at deck west

2413
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,690
and and so we got the the top hardware guys

2414
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,770
and we got the top software guys

2415
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,330
and you know it was about 10 10 or something like that

2416
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:31,969
and we we hired some more people

2417
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:32,409
we hired

2418
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:33,330
um

2419
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,570
we had part of the thing about

2420
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:36,330
uh

2421
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,290
the the group was

2422
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,449
we the hardware group

2423
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,290
not not like the software group

2424
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,530
the software group

2425
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:42,530
um

2426
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:46,210
microsoft wanted to make sure we had microsoft people in the software group

2427
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,090
because otherwise we would just produce some something that was duck the duck cultural thing

2428
01:25:52,119 --> 01:25:52,369
right

2429
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:53,969
so we had

2430
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,010
um

2431
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:56,010
actually

2432
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:59,850
i think we have one one software guy and he was a pretty good

2433
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,489
pretty good

2434
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:01,010
um

2435
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:01,489
or

2436
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,250
um

2437
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,290
he was a vocal microsoft guy and he had a lot of ideas

2438
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:08,409
um

2439
01:26:09,159 --> 01:26:11,170
which actually dovetailed with ours

2440
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:11,730
pretty well

2441
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:12,530
um

2442
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,290
about how to build an operating system

2443
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:14,650
they

2444
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,409
microsoft had been working with ibm on os2 for several years

2445
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,889
by that time and that relationship was not going real well

2446
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:27,050
and this guy had worked on that so he was very happy to join our group

2447
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:32,449
so you parachute kind of into microsoft and after a short period of time

2448
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:32,929
you look around

2449
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:33,610
what did

2450
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:34,250
what did you see

2451
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,610
what did microsoft look like at that time

2452
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:38,610
well

2453
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:40,369
microsoft didn't look like deck

2454
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:41,409
um

2455
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:42,409
actually

2456
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,210
i should say

2457
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:44,210
um

2458
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,610
microsoft was a very different company than deck deck was

2459
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:48,210
um

2460
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,810
the thing i liked about deck

2461
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:55,449
and i think that i can honestly say that that i spent most of my best

2462
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,530
the most enjoyable engineering years at deck between 1971 and in 1980

2463
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:03,889
or maybe 82 or 83

2464
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:04,889
was

2465
01:27:04,899 --> 01:27:06,929
deck was mainly an engineering company

2466
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,170
it was run mainly by the engineers

2467
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:11,250
um

2468
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,610
the engineers proposed the products

2469
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:20,250
they talked to customers um they tried to produce very high quality products and um

2470
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:21,770
put them in the market

2471
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,010
and then the marketing arm of deck was not

2472
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:26,409
i would not say

2473
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:28,770
during those years was really strong

2474
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:29,770
uh

2475
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:30,770
i think it became strong

2476
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:31,330
after that

2477
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:32,489
much stronger

2478
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:33,130
because it

2479
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:33,730
the

2480
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,409
the focus of the company became much more marketing oriented than it was engineering oriented

2481
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,969
but microsoft was very marketing oriented

2482
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:43,250
microsoft was

2483
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:44,250
um

2484
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:44,690
they

2485
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:44,929
well

2486
01:27:44,939 --> 01:27:48,330
they marketed the pc software doss to ibm

2487
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:49,330
um

2488
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:51,250
so they were very

2489
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:51,850
um

2490
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,810
more marketing oriented

2491
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:54,250
which you know

2492
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:54,850
i thought was

2493
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:55,850
um

2494
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:57,369
i like that

2495
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,690
because i liked it and i didn't like it

2496
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,170
i liked it

2497
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:02,050
because it was going to be

2498
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:04,170
i was going to have a a group of marketing people

2499
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:06,210
that were really going to be out hawking the projects

2500
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:07,330
or products

2501
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:08,730
on the other hand

2502
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,250
i i didn't like it

2503
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,489
because they might have their fingers in what we were going to do

2504
01:28:12,499 --> 01:28:17,690
and it turned out that the original version of nt

2505
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:18,850
um

2506
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,810
was pretty much an engineering deriven thing

2507
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,290
except for a couple of things

2508
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,570
and that was that

2509
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:26,570
um

2510
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:27,050
the

2511
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:29,090
in addition to being portable

2512
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:36,050
microsoft wanted this system to be compatible with multiple operating environments

2513
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,290
so that sort of let us to an architecture within uh nt

2514
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:42,770
that would allow uh

2515
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:43,969
different subsystem personalities

2516
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,330
and so we had

2517
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:48,810
we had to keep ibm happy and run os2

2518
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:49,889
of course

2519
01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:50,810
we want to run dos

2520
01:28:51,560 --> 01:28:52,889
and then the other thing that was

2521
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:57,130
um big was very popular

2522
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,409
i big

2523
01:28:58,419 --> 01:29:00,010
it was popular was posix

2524
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,409
these are the

2525
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:01,850
uh

2526
01:29:02,239 --> 01:29:04,250
the standardized unix interfaces

2527
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:09,650
so the personality of this thing was going to be this multifaceted thing

2528
01:29:11,159 --> 01:29:11,409
um

2529
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:12,409
so

2530
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:13,969
um

2531
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:14,969
see

2532
01:29:14,979 --> 01:29:15,610
i'm trying to think

2533
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,050
why hard did i go down this rout

2534
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:17,850
well

2535
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:19,010
it was kind of like you

2536
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:19,250
you

2537
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:19,530
you

2538
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:20,290
oh

2539
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:20,570
okay

2540
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:21,170
we're dropped in

2541
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,010
drop in and i

2542
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:23,330
so

2543
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:24,210
so

2544
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:24,489
anyway

2545
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:29,330
the microsoft people or microsoft sort of dedicated that level

2546
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,449
but none of the rest of the level

2547
01:29:31,459 --> 01:29:32,770
the rest of the level was pretty engineering

2548
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:33,730
uh

2549
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,050
driven

2550
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:37,210
and we set about um

2551
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,489
designing windows nt

2552
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,889
much in the same way that we had set about designing vms

2553
01:29:44,639 --> 01:29:46,330
except that in the

2554
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:47,409
in terms of

2555
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:48,130
uh

2556
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:49,250
windows nt

2557
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:50,250
uh

2558
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:56,489
we decided to produce a much more more detailed specification of the system and vms

2559
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:58,170
we sort of had

2560
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:04,330
we had this small group and we spent a lot of time talking about things

2561
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:04,969
and we

2562
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:05,969
we did do some specs

2563
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:09,290
but they were pretty rudimentary specs for nt

2564
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,850
we wrote a humongous spec

2565
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:16,969
and i'd say it was over six months about how the whole system would work so

2566
01:30:16,979 --> 01:30:19,369
that people could pick up the spec new

2567
01:30:19,379 --> 01:30:20,369
as new people came in

2568
01:30:20,379 --> 01:30:21,250
they could pick up the spec

2569
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:26,090
and understand understand it and read the code and actually kind of understand what was going to go on

2570
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,770
our first projected um

2571
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:30,770
uh

2572
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,889
delivery date for the os was like two years

2573
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:34,610
now

2574
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:37,850
it actually took us five years to produce the first os

2575
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:39,690
um

2576
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,130
i could have never

2577
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,130
if you'asked me

2578
01:30:42,140 --> 01:30:42,449
even today

2579
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,210
if it would have taken five years back

2580
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,690
then i would have said no

2581
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,170
it's so we can do it in two years

2582
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,730
but there was so much more to do

2583
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:51,730
um

2584
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,969
vms did not have a graphical user interface

2585
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,090
we had to do

2586
01:30:55,159 --> 01:31:02,730
that we didn't have the subsystem problem in in vms we had are running multiple personalities

2587
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:04,850
we had to run the pdp1 binaries

2588
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,730
and we produced what was called the ame

2589
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,210
which was the application migration executive

2590
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,050
and we ran all the

2591
01:31:11,060 --> 01:31:11,369
in fact

2592
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:17,050
that's how we got the vms software out was by running the 11 software

2593
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,210
completely unconstrained architecture

2594
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:21,290
in the in the in the io

2595
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,570
and so in the pc

2596
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:24,570
yeah

2597
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:25,610
and so

2598
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:27,090
um

2599
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:30,570
we had a lot more to do and and we

2600
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:30,850
we

2601
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:31,130
you know

2602
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:32,170
we started out with this

2603
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:32,929
um

2604
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,250
this idea that we're going to produce the first risk pc

2605
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:40,210
and we're going to produce a software for it and we and we make this

2606
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:41,210
well

2607
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,489
i i can't say that we make

2608
01:31:42,499 --> 01:31:43,330
we make this mistake

2609
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,250
this mistake has already been made for us

2610
01:31:45,260 --> 01:31:45,850
when we get there

2611
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,130
is

2612
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:47,090
is intel

2613
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:50,369
at the time is producing the i860

2614
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:53,369
and this is um

2615
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:58,250
one of the fastest risk machines in certain applications

2616
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,810
and those applications are mainly graphics

2617
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,210
so microsoft wanted to to use

2618
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:12,409
that is the microprocessor for our first reference implementation

2619
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,969
we're going to build a reference implementation

2620
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:19,409
we of the 860 and and we got one of the um

2621
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:20,650
the oems

2622
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:21,650
uh

2623
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:21,770
which

2624
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:25,050
which was aletti that signed up to build this

2625
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:29,010
so we were going to build the reference system and they were going to take the design

2626
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,010
um

2627
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,810
make it manufacturable and manufacture it

2628
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,929
we were in a build a software

2629
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:35,929
uh

2630
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:38,369
but then a partway through that

2631
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:39,330
we

2632
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,010
we found out that the 860 was pretty sick

2633
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,130
it had a lot of arata

2634
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,650
that would make it

2635
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,250
um

2636
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,369
pretty unusable

2637
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:50,489
is an os based system

2638
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:51,489
um

2639
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:55,489
it had some quirks that were made it very nice for the graphics world

2640
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,369
but not very well for the

2641
01:32:58,119 --> 01:32:59,610
for the operating system world

2642
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,610
had it virtually tag cash

2643
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,330
so basically

2644
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:04,610
every time you switch context

2645
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:09,610
you sweep the cash because it has all the virtual tags from the last address space you ran in

2646
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:13,170
so anyway it took five years to do the first version

2647
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:14,170
um

2648
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:14,929
so there

2649
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:17,489
i guess your original question was how different was the environment

2650
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:17,929
well

2651
01:33:17,939 --> 01:33:18,929
the environment was a lot different

2652
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:21,369
because deck was a engineer

2653
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,889
ing run company and we're always based on engineering excellence

2654
01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:26,889
microsoft

2655
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:27,650
i

2656
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:28,730
i think

2657
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:29,730
um

2658
01:33:30,119 --> 01:33:30,369
justifiably

2659
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:35,290
i would say it's a marketing based company and they weren't um

2660
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,690
based on engineering excellence

2661
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:41,210
so there was sort of a a little clash between our culture

2662
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:42,210
um

2663
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:44,050
and the microsoft culture

2664
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,170
but i think that we instilled a lot of that into the microsoft culture

2665
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,770
but we still had a lot of things going on that were sort of out outside our our

2666
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:53,770
um

2667
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,570
our control that we within the microsoft culture

2668
01:33:58,119 --> 01:33:58,369
so

2669
01:33:59,119 --> 01:33:59,369
um

2670
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:02,170
that made it made the project a lot longer

2671
01:34:03,239 --> 01:34:03,489
um

2672
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:08,530
and the fire was very different somewhere along the word you said to me

2673
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,330
you know there a lot of coders at microsoft

2674
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,610
but no software engineering

2675
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:15,010
and you had to bring the discipline of software engineering

2676
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:15,650
microsoft

2677
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:16,409
that

2678
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:17,369
um

2679
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:21,810
one of the things that we brought was the engineering discipline on building software

2680
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:22,810
um

2681
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:28,570
and i don't think that that microsoft had the engineering discipline that we had at that time

2682
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:29,570
um

2683
01:34:29,719 --> 01:34:30,090
of course

2684
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:30,409
it's

2685
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:30,850
you know

2686
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,730
that's 28 years ago

2687
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,889
it's a long time and and um

2688
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,250
the discipline at microsoft now is

2689
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:37,969
is i would say

2690
01:34:37,979 --> 01:34:38,369
is excellent

2691
01:34:39,159 --> 01:34:39,409
um

2692
01:34:40,159 --> 01:34:40,409
there's

2693
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:41,730
there's a lot of stuff in place

2694
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,210
it's

2695
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,210
it's not the same atmosphere that we had with the original nt team

2696
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:46,889
because it was

2697
01:34:46,899 --> 01:34:47,810
our team was small

2698
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:48,889
you know

2699
01:34:48,899 --> 01:34:50,730
we started out with 25 guys

2700
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:51,929
um

2701
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,130
the the end of version one were 150

2702
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:57,050
at the end of version four

2703
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:57,929
we're 400

2704
01:34:58,679 --> 01:34:59,090
which is

2705
01:34:59,360 --> 01:34:59,610
um

2706
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:00,050
big

2707
01:35:00,199 --> 01:35:01,449
today is 4,

2708
01:35:01,459 --> 01:35:01,449
000

2709
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,130
so now

2710
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:05,730
along the way

2711
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:06,409
uh

2712
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,530
a lot of things get added to what nt is

2713
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:12,530
i guess you had program managers or some

2714
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,210
that was

2715
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,330
i think the title that

2716
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:14,969
um

2717
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,530
as far as the the culture and environment

2718
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:18,290
um

2719
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,250
you know

2720
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:19,530
at deck

2721
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,170
we had program manager

2722
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:24,010
but but program managers were sort of

2723
01:35:26,239 --> 01:35:26,489
um

2724
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:27,730
sort of

2725
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:29,690
they were quasi marketing people

2726
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:30,770
in some sense

2727
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:31,489
um

2728
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,610
they didn't try to manage the engineering effort

2729
01:35:33,639 --> 01:35:36,170
the engineering effort was managed by the engineering people

2730
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,570
so there was a big clash in the beginning

2731
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:45,850
when between me and the the program managers of of microsoft over who did what

2732
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:47,050
and i i wrote

2733
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:49,570
i i wish i could find this piece of mail i wrote

2734
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:50,770
but i wrote this big thing

2735
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:54,610
big big piece of mail to our program manager about his job and mine

2736
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:58,369
which laid out what i thought his job was and what my job was

2737
01:35:58,560 --> 01:35:58,810
and

2738
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,210
uh

2739
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:03,409
so that pretty much worked its way itself out

2740
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,969
because we pretty much operated the way we did it

2741
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:06,290
deck

2742
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:12,050
but over time program managers at microsoft have taken a a more

2743
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,050
uh

2744
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:16,969
direct um involvement and control over what happens

2745
01:36:17,719 --> 01:36:20,650
so the you have this enormously complicated thing

2746
01:36:20,679 --> 01:36:21,610
multiple platforms

2747
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:24,170
you're going to run on portability

2748
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:25,610
um

2749
01:36:26,360 --> 01:36:31,889
keeping control of this and keeping everybody moving for five years gets to be quite a challenge

2750
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:33,969
so the so

2751
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,489
a little bit about the compa or the uh

2752
01:36:36,679 --> 01:36:38,050
the complexity of what we're building

2753
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,570
now we talked about the 860 and the problems with the 860

2754
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:42,369
well

2755
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:43,810
partway down the road

2756
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:45,250
you know we'd only went about a year

2757
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:48,369
and we decided there's no way we can go with the 860

2758
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,489
and so i said

2759
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:50,770
well

2760
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:51,290
what should we do

2761
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:52,250
so he said

2762
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:52,770
well

2763
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,650
how about myips

2764
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:02,409
myips is doing the r4000 that that's the platform that we ought to make the first one

2765
01:37:02,419 --> 01:37:07,489
so our hardware group switched to the r4000 and we started

2766
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:08,409
uh

2767
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,090
to

2768
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,050
uh

2769
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:11,650
go in that direction

2770
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,170
and now this just to make a lot of difference to the operating system

2771
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,929
because the way the operating system is structured or was structured

2772
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:19,650
was we

2773
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:25,010
we sort of taking the the stuff that was absolutely portable and it was still portable

2774
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,409
and then the stuff

2775
01:37:26,419 --> 01:37:33,130
that was hardware architecture specific was divided out so that you just had to to replace that

2776
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:38,409
so the first thing that happened was deck got wind of what we're doing and says

2777
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:38,810
well

2778
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:39,770
gez

2779
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:46,570
we're building an r3000 workstation why don't you support the r3000 to

2780
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:47,570
so

2781
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:48,170
i guess

2782
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:48,369
foolishly

2783
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:49,130
we said

2784
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:49,650
okay

2785
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:51,290
we'll support the 3, 000 too well

2786
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:51,489
well

2787
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,409
that put us into some difficulty now

2788
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:58,610
because the 3, 000 is not entirely compatible with the 4, 000

2789
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,929
so now we're building for two two platforms

2790
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:01,969
so we have the r3000

2791
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:06,889
the r4000 and not long after said

2792
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:07,290
well

2793
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:08,409
you know

2794
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,530
it looks like it's going to be a little while longer than we thought

2795
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:15,050
maybe we should add the 386 back into the mix

2796
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:15,330
here

2797
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:15,730
you know

2798
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,290
intel's coming out with a

2799
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:23,810
i think it's a 38625 25 megahertz um

2800
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,570
let's add that in

2801
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,449
so now we start

2802
01:38:28,199 --> 01:38:28,449
uh

2803
01:38:28,459 --> 01:38:28,690
we

2804
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:28,810
don't

2805
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,369
we aren't building any hardware because there's a

2806
01:38:31,379 --> 01:38:35,330
there is the industry infrastructure to build x86 based system

2807
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,969
so we don't do anything there

2808
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:37,969
and

2809
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:38,570
um

2810
01:38:39,159 --> 01:38:40,969
so now we're building for b

2811
01:38:40,979 --> 01:38:47,570
basically three targets and three operating environments and the gooey stuff

2812
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,290
and now along

2813
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,409
comes deck back with alpha and says gez

2814
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:58,090
we want to run windows on alpha too

2815
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,929
and so we said

2816
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:01,449
okay

2817
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,130
so we started doing alpha

2818
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,210
and then ibm says

2819
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:07,250
well

2820
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,250
geez

2821
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,170
as long as you're doing all that

2822
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,170
let's do the power pc

2823
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,409
so we're doing actually four platforms

2824
01:39:15,159 --> 01:39:16,130
we're doing four platforms

2825
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:17,610
if you only count myips one

2826
01:39:17,620 --> 01:39:18,210
if you count them

2827
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:18,369
two

2828
01:39:18,379 --> 01:39:19,690
then we're doing five

2829
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:20,849
in addition

2830
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:28,090
what happened was somewhere in the in the early 90s we had

2831
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:29,409
we had this thing on the 16

2832
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:30,409
it ran on doss

2833
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:33,010
that was a um a layer

2834
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:36,010
it just it was a program that ran on top of doss

2835
01:39:36,199 --> 01:39:37,770
it was called windows

2836
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:39,449
we did windows 1

2837
01:39:40,199 --> 01:39:41,369
the industry said hoam

2838
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:43,650
we did industry or windows 2

2839
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:45,570
the industry said ham

2840
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:47,570
we did windows 3

2841
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:48,730
the window

2842
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,090
the industry said ham

2843
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,250
we we did windows 3. 1

2844
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,730
we sold 16 million copies in 6 months

2845
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,570
it was like unbelievable

2846
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:00,210
so bill says

2847
01:40:01,599 --> 01:40:01,849
hm

2848
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:03,330
i guess our major

2849
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:06,770
our main operating environment will not be os2 anymore

2850
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:07,770
it will be windows

2851
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:13,889
so we switched from our main operating environment being os2 with the program manager

2852
01:40:14,199 --> 01:40:17,449
which was their graphical univ interface to windows

2853
01:40:18,199 --> 01:40:19,690
and when we brought in windows

2854
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:25,810
then we brought brought in also all the compatibility requirements with windows 16

2855
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,369
so we're running on all these platforms

2856
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:33,330
we're running these different environments

2857
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:36,929
we're running a 16bit doss emulator

2858
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,050
we're running a 16bit windows on windows emulator

2859
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,690
we're running

2860
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:43,690
uh

2861
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:48,489
windows 32bit emulators on alpha power pc and myips

2862
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,889
all those things to to get to the first release

2863
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:52,849
now

2864
01:40:52,859 --> 01:40:57,570
the first release actually only supported myips and and um the x86

2865
01:40:58,320 --> 01:40:58,810
then i think

2866
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:01,170
about six months later we did another project called daytona

2867
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:02,449
which was another release

2868
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,849
and that included alpha

2869
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:05,610
which was 35

2870
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:06,489
and then

2871
01:41:06,499 --> 01:41:09,530
about six months later we did the power pc

2872
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,409
so that's kind of why it took five years

2873
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:14,010
oh yeah

2874
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:15,530
easy to understand

2875
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:15,969
in retrospect

2876
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:17,690
lots of things changed

2877
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,570
lots of things changed

2878
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,130
so keeping the team going

2879
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:22,969
you know

2880
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:25,170
here's the the dave cutler

2881
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:27,489
infamous management style at work

2882
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:28,489
uh

2883
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,770
talk about keeping the team going

2884
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:33,770
uh

2885
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:35,330
well

2886
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:38,969
you know i'i've um

2887
01:41:39,719 --> 01:41:39,969
i

2888
01:41:39,979 --> 01:41:40,210
i

2889
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:43,170
i said earlier that i'm always consider myself as a leader

2890
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:43,810
not a manager

2891
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,170
so i've always tried to be a leader

2892
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:51,449
that is part of the team versus somebody that is separated from the team

2893
01:41:51,459 --> 01:41:52,810
so i'm always a part of the team

2894
01:41:53,199 --> 01:41:55,929
if the team is stressed and up against the wall

2895
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:57,530
then i'm stressed and up against the wall

2896
01:41:58,159 --> 01:41:58,409
so

2897
01:41:59,159 --> 01:41:59,409
um

2898
01:41:59,419 --> 01:42:00,050
i think we did

2899
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:05,449
we didn't have any um problems with um

2900
01:42:06,199 --> 01:42:07,330
people burned out

2901
01:42:07,639 --> 01:42:08,010
you know

2902
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,010
people pretty much

2903
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:09,929
uh

2904
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,889
stood the whole five years

2905
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,650
although there were some ramification

2906
01:42:14,119 --> 01:42:15,130
i mean people got divorced

2907
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,250
you know

2908
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:20,210
there other things that happened and we had very little attrition

2909
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,050
i mean just really small attrition

2910
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:24,050
um

2911
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:25,849
everybody believed in the product

2912
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,969
and the other thing we did was we did

2913
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:28,610
we

2914
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:29,210
we did this

2915
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:29,690
uh

2916
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:31,250
every every friday night

2917
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:31,810
we had a party

2918
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,330
we called it the whim

2919
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,170
and the whim was the weekly integration meeting

2920
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,290
and it

2921
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:37,770
it was

2922
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,409
it was instigated by a guy named dave thompson

2923
01:42:41,119 --> 01:42:42,210
who was in the network group

2924
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:43,050
because we pulled in

2925
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,570
we eventually pulled in the network group

2926
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:45,290
um

2927
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:47,050
originally in the pc world

2928
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,650
the network group was separate from the operating system group

2929
01:42:51,660 --> 01:42:53,730
and it was just an add-on you know

2930
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:54,170
it was just

2931
01:42:54,199 --> 01:42:55,090
it's some other program

2932
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:56,690
if you want to do network operations

2933
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:58,449
you ran a program to do that

2934
01:42:58,459 --> 01:42:59,929
it wasn't building the operating system

2935
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:06,130
and we had planned all along to build it into the operating system with the vms model

2936
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:12,409
so we're growing pretty rapidly as we're pulling in some of these groups and we're growing from you know

2937
01:43:12,419 --> 01:43:14,290
20 people to 150 or or whatever

2938
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,369
and so he said

2939
01:43:16,379 --> 01:43:16,610
well

2940
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:17,489
why don't we have this

2941
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,170
we'll have a meeting every friday afternoon and we'll get

2942
01:43:21,239 --> 01:43:21,610
you know

2943
01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:23,690
beer and pizza and chips and we'll meet

2944
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:24,010
and

2945
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:24,730
um

2946
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:27,610
just everybody will get to know each other

2947
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,610
so this grew into a huge thing

2948
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:34,770
i mean i can imagine five years and every friday night that you're doing this

2949
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:35,849
you know

2950
01:43:35,859 --> 01:43:36,409
we start out

2951
01:43:36,419 --> 01:43:37,810
we're in a room about this size

2952
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:44,010
and we end up in a huge room and we start out that that i send the development managers

2953
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:45,010
there's

2954
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,530
there's like four development managers under me

2955
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:48,530
um

2956
01:43:48,599 --> 01:43:51,409
i send them down to safeway to buy a few beers

2957
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:54,690
and pick up some pizza and bring them back to the to the end

2958
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:57,690
when where we have full catering from marriott

2959
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,730
may marot's bring in everything

2960
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,170
and and we go from

2961
01:44:01,639 --> 01:44:02,050
you know

2962
01:44:02,119 --> 01:44:02,369
like

2963
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:03,369
um

2964
01:44:04,119 --> 01:44:04,369
uh

2965
01:44:04,379 --> 01:44:07,449
chips and salsa and beer and pizza to uh

2966
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:08,050
shrimp

2967
01:44:08,599 --> 01:44:12,170
and you know all sorts of stuff that's catered kegs of beer

2968
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:12,889
i mean it was

2969
01:44:12,899 --> 01:44:13,130
it

2970
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:13,290
was

2971
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:14,570
it was interesting

2972
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:16,330
and then there were some things where you know

2973
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:17,929
we always have

2974
01:44:18,679 --> 01:44:18,929
uh

2975
01:44:18,939 --> 01:44:20,010
something going on where

2976
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:20,489
um

2977
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:21,889
we try to

2978
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:22,330
uh

2979
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:22,730
to

2980
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:23,330
uh

2981
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,210
get people to feel better about what's going on and how much stress they're in

2982
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:32,290
i know there's some people that felt they were under a lot of stress and sometimes they break

2983
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:35,330
but i think generally we held everything together pretty good
