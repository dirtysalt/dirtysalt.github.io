1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,918
I don't think I've ever had a Guinness.

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,753
Unlike Scott Wu,

3
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:06,881
I've had many, many, many beers, perhaps thousands,

4
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,258
but I'm not sure I've ever had a Guinness.

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:10,010
Without an alarm clock, I will wake up

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,302
almost exactly

7
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:13,805
between 2:55 and 3 a.m. almost every day.

8
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,933
Wow. So you wake up ahead of earnings.

9
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,309
No, no. Forget earnings.

10
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:19,144
Every day.

11
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,520
You just want to see what happens at the open.

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,896
No, I don't want to wake up.

13
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,149
I actually don't want to wake up.

14
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,068
I mean, if I ran a private company like Stripe,

15
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,778
I wouldn't go public.

16
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:30,363
I think the public markets—

17
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,741
It's ironic because you're a public markets investor.

18
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,575
Yeah.

19
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,367
I think the public markets

20
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,869
are kind of problematic at this point.

21
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,247
Should we try to split the G?

22
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,623
Oh my God. No.

23
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,333
We cover this in an episode with an actual Irishman.

24
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,210
It's a completely—it's an invasive species.

25
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,754
It's a made up TikTok thing.

26
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,588
Yeah, but how did that start?

27
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,422
But you can.

28
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,840
You're a crass American so you can,

29
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,841
and maybe we should get it on camera,

30
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:50,967
and that would be funny.

31
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,511
We really trying to do this? Split the G?

32
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,471
Only Mike is.

33
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,264
Only Mike is, unless you...

34
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:57,974
Not close.

35
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,808
Oh!

36
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,185
That's not bad. That's not bad.

37
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,103
Can we zoom in here, please?

38
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:02,979
Camera roll three.

39
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,274
Dan Sundheim is one of the world's

40
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,734
top hedge fund managers.

41
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,611
He runs D1 Capital, which invests in public

42
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,862
and private companies across a bunch

43
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,363
of totally different industries.

44
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,907
Dan's one of the smartest investors I know.

45
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,950
So Daniel Gross and I try to get into his head

46
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,661
and figure out how he analyzes companies.

47
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,913
Cheers! Cheers.

48
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,832
Okay, Dan and I were wondering,

49
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,000
what trading app do you actually use?

50
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,377
Like, if you are trading underneath the table

51
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,756
during the interview, like, are you in Interactive Brokers?

52
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,550
Are you WhatsApping someone who executes this?

53
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,427
I'm just emailing. Okay.

54
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,845
I'm emailing the trader with that, yeah.

55
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,388
I mean, I'm checking Bloomberg all day long.

56
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,681
Yeah. Yeah. That's the app on my phone.

57
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,017
Yes. But I'm just emailing,

58
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,185
texting my traders.

59
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,229
And if the trader's like sleeping or something,

60
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,564
is there an app that you use?

61
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,982
Or is— If he's sleeping

62
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,900
during the day...

63
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,362
We haven't encountered that problem.

64
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,655
That'd be a different problem,

65
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,573
but if he's sleeping at night,

66
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,575
we actually have overnight traders in Asia.

67
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,370
So, once you told me sometimes when you struggle

68
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,955
to sleep at night, there's nothing better to do

69
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,165
than wake up and start trading Asia.

70
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,959
So, is that your East Coast trader

71
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,710
or do you have another person?

72
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,589
Yeah, we have another person that we outsource.

73
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,842
I see, yeah. I see.

74
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,844
And then how, what fraction of AUM

75
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,012
is just Dan Sundheim trades?

76
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,597
Or Dan Sundheim decisions?

77
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,851
95% plus.

78
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,726
Oh, so all of it?

79
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,811
Yeah. Okay.

80
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,688
I mean, people have trading authority,

81
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,690
but most of the trades, I put in myself.

82
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,901
Okay, so memos come up to you

83
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,779
and then you ultimately size them

84
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,907
and decide whether to do them or not or something like that?

85
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,325
Yeah, I mean, you know,

86
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,036
the process starts way before the memo.

87
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,497
I'm in dialogue with the team about the idea,

88
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,623
why they like it.

89
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,251
You know, we're having conversations

90
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,794
way before it gets to the memo stage.

91
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,379
But then we get to the memo stage,

92
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,798
and usually we start buying it before,

93
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,426
because in the public markets, you know,

94
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,260
if you have a good idea,

95
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,888
you could take a month and a half to like write a memo,

96
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,056
but by that time, the price may have moved.

97
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,435
So usually we start buying it before the memo's done,

98
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,104
and then the memo is kind of the final, you know,

99
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,481
compilation of the due diligence.

100
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:14,861
And that's when the best thing that could happen

101
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,739
is we're buying it and then the stock keeps going down.

102
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,990
So by the time you have the memo

103
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,659
and have even the most conviction, you can buy more.

104
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,828
A lot of times it's going the wrong way.

105
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,413
But what fraction of the time, like,

106
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,456
do you finish writing the memo and you're like,

107
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,875
"Oh no, this is a terrible company.

108
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,336
This is not good."

109
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,170
Yeah, yeah. No, like, that doesn't happen

110
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,004
because usually they'll start writing the memo

111
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,381
and then they'll come to me and be like,

112
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,467
"I think I made a mistake," and we'll sell it.

113
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,594
Like rarely have I—I don't think I've ever

114
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,847
owned a position because we had discussed it,

115
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,891
then read the memo and been like,

116
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,809
"Oh my God, what are we doing here?"

117
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,896
That'd be a bad sign for the analysts.

118
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,231
We jumped right off the deep end.

119
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,526
Describe what D1 does. AUM, strategy, for the uninitiated.

120
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,780
Yeah. So we invest in public and private companies.

121
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,074
We do fundamental analysis.

122
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,411
And so, deep research, trying to understand business models,

123
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,747
trying to understand company prospects,

124
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,290
choosing the right management team,

125
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,501
and whether it's public or private,

126
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,630
we're investing with the horizon of three to five years.

127
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,466
And we apply the same due diligence process

128
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,094
to both public and private.

129
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,347
Obviously private is a one-way door

130
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,932
and public is a two-way door.

131
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,600
So, you know, that's different.

132
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,810
Is private actually a one-way door,

133
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,397
even as just the private markets have matured

134
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,731
and there's so much more secondary activity

135
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,691
and things like that?

136
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,234
Like, do you still have to treat it as a one-way door?

137
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,068
Definitely.

138
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,611
I mean, you can sell like,

139
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,446
the best companies you can sell easily.

140
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,073
But those aren't the companies you want to sell.

141
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:47,078
So, you know, we rarely transact in the secondary market

142
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,873
because we don't want to sell the best companies.

143
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,335
And it's hard, like, people think you can just transact

144
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,005
in the secondary market but if you want to sell $50 million,

145
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,091
$100 million, people have to get information rights

146
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,592
from the company and then it's like...

147
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,219
And it's viewed as a signal if you're like large—

148
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,471
Exactly, they go to the management team and say,

149
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,682
"I want to sell," and the person doesn't follow through.

150
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,058
It's not great.

151
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:14,022
So, the AUM is about $25 billion, about two-thirds private,

152
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,566
$10 million public.

153
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:21,029
Public is long-short, you know, all bottom up.

154
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,156
No, you know, no quant.

155
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,782
Really kind of the same thing people were doing

156
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,493
in terms of stock picking 30 years ago.

157
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,663
And when you say no quant, that is, you're contrasting

158
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,625
to some of the more short-term technical firms

159
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,878
that are just trading based on what'll happen the next day,

160
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,171
the next week, the next month?

161
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,297
Exactly.

162
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,217
We're not using any computer programs to guide our trading.

163
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,472
You know, we are not trading based on quarters.

164
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,266
You could be doing my job

165
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,601
the same way 20 years ago.

166
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,311
You wouldn't have exactly the same tools,

167
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,812
but it's just, you know.

168
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,022
Do you think of any of those signals

169
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,815
that people talk about when you think of when

170
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,983
to enter or exit a trade?

171
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,487
Like, the stock would be oversold or overbought?

172
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,155
No. Okay.

173
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,531
What I find interesting about you guys

174
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,951
is you're long term in that you're not,

175
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,120
like you were saying, some of the quant guys

176
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,539
who are just trying to predict what happens

177
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,917
in the next, you know, what's the next buyer doing

178
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,668
or the high frequency guys or something like that.

179
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,712
You're instead just thinking, like,

180
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,422
is this company selling good product?

181
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,674
Will their sales exceed, you know, what people expect,

182
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,343
and will that add up to a good business?

183
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,388
And so, the work is evaluating future earnings

184
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,599
of the company, but there are some people

185
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,975
who are really buy and hold.

186
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,937
Like Costco seems to attract a lot of shareholders

187
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,438
who think there is no price

188
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,065
that is too expensive for Costco,

189
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,234
and there's kind of a huge loyalty there.

190
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,487
Whereas, you can have a price on both ends where,

191
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,281
at this price, I am an enthusiastic buyer

192
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,409
and at this price, you know, God bless 'em.

193
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,701
I'm selling the entire position.

194
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,329
And you kind of have that price boundary at both ends.

195
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,707
Yeah, practically we may say,

196
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,751
"We think that in three years this company

197
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,461
is going to be worth double."

198
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,965
Right? So kind of roughly 20-something percent IRR.

199
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,925
But if we're right about the company,

200
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,886
usually it doesn't go 24%, 24%, 24%.

201
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,805
People will pull forward the IRR.

202
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,599
The stock may go up 50% in the first year

203
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,602
if things go well, then the forward IRR

204
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,272
all the sudden looks a lot, you know, worse

205
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,109
and you're moving capital to the next opportunity.

206
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,945
I think the biggest mistakes, if we would look back,

207
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,114
I mean, it's easy to think about the mistakes

208
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,241
where you lost money, and you think about those a lot,

209
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,911
but the biggest mistakes are selling the Costcos too early.

210
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,415
Because, you know, the IRR is totally dependent upon

211
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,250
what you assume the exit multiple is.

212
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,670
And that is difficult to be precise about,

213
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,590
what the right exit multiple is for a business.

214
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,049
So let's talk about painful mistakes.

215
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,677
Like, can we talk about Netflix or something like that?

216
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,222
Yeah, so Netflix, when we started the firm,

217
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,141
almost every LP I met with,

218
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,851
they always want to hear a stock pitch.

219
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,811
So I pitched them Netflix,

220
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,190
and actually when we were interviewing candidates,

221
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,984
what we did was we gave every single interviewee

222
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,486
the same case study.

223
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,280
We said—this is in 2018.

224
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,784
So we said, "Look at Netflix, look at Spotify.

225
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,245
If you had to buy one of these businesses

226
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,497
and hold them for five years,

227
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,248
which one would it be and why?"

228
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,960
So, it was like Netflix all the time

229
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,004
because I was talking about Netflix with LPs,

230
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,882
I was talking about it with interview candidates,

231
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:31,928
and ultimately the thesis was correct

232
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,471
and I didn't hold it long enough.

233
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,849
And so, in 2018, the reason Netflix was contrarian

234
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,976
was it was obviously a great product that people loved,

235
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:39,809
but they were burning a lot of money.

236
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:41,187
And so it was just not clear

237
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,897
was this like a classic tech company,

238
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,731
where, would they ever make money?

239
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,150
Like, that's why it might've been contrarian with LPs.

240
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,402
Yeah, I think the issue is

241
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,946
there's very few tech companies

242
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,740
that are massively capital-intensive, right?

243
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,743
Almost every tech company loses money for a period of time.

244
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,621
But the typical software company, you're looking at, like,

245
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,289
there's operating losses, you leverage it,

246
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,167
and then people are very used to that business model.

247
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,586
Up into the LLMs, there are very few tech companies

248
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,798
where it's like a huge fixed investment,

249
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,843
and then the incremental margins on the sales

250
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,262
are extremely high.

251
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,431
And so, what that meant was that Netflix

252
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:21,102
was investing heavily in content, which is a fixed cost,

253
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,896
and then they were selling that to consumers.

254
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,191
The next year, they were investing more in content

255
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,651
and selling it to more consumers.

256
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,987
But you're constantly investing more and more in content.

257
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,071
And the skeptics thought this would have

258
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,072
to keep going up forever and they'd never make money.

259
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,366
Yeah, because cash flow just looks worse and worse

260
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,660
every year because you're investing more and more.

261
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,665
But ultimately, that created a moat that was

262
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:48,004
I think the defining aspect of the business model

263
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,131
that made Netflix what it is today,

264
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,091
meaning that it's like a flywheel.

265
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,386
You invest a ton before anyone else.

266
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,263
Actually what happened here is the media companies

267
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,682
enabled Netflix by selling them content

268
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,227
and then Netflix invested a ton, sold to people globally,

269
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,313
took that money, invested more in content,

270
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,856
actually borrowed in the high yield market,

271
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,483
invested more in content, sold it to more people,

272
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,818
and then the flywheel then, you know,

273
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,695
within five years they're investing way more

274
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,238
in content than anyone else.

275
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,781
They're selling it to way more consumers.

276
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,117
The incremental cost of selling that content

277
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,994
is very, very low.

278
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,996
And so you have this fixed asset

279
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,457
that you've built up that...

280
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,544
And what ultimately caused you to sell it?

281
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,212
We had transitions on our team.

282
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,673
And, look, we cover every sector, right?

283
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,300
So, there's like,

284
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,636
we're covering at any given time 300 stocks,

285
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,721
and we had transitions on our team

286
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,726
and our media analyst left and

287
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,270
I was focused on other things.

288
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,606
It was not excusable, because if I look back,

289
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,233
we get plenty of things wrong. But Netflix,

290
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,401
we got exactly right. Yeah, how do you think

291
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,986
about, there's like a sense of, do you ever have this issue

292
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,488
where like people want to pitch new things

293
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,365
because they're like new and exciting,

294
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,743
and, I guess, the good old Occam's razor idea—

295
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,161
just hold what you have.

296
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,581
Do you ever have to push back against that?

297
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,416
Yeah, I probably should push back more.

298
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,543
I mean, you know, I think it's like a human tendency,

299
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,711
like, "Oh, this is a new company.

300
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,545
I love investing.

301
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,047
Let's learn about this new company.

302
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,757
And this sounds super exciting."

303
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,217
But at the end of the day,

304
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,929
there's like only so many amazing companies,

305
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,098
and trying to

306
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,350
sell them and move into something else

307
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,102
is almost always a bad decision.

308
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,770
That's the nice thing about the private markets

309
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,815
is that, once you invest, you can't sell.

310
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,692
And usually for the best companies,

311
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,860
that's a huge benefit, ultimately.

312
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,780
Yeah. I just want to go back to starting D1 for a second.

313
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,534
So the lore is that prior to D1,

314
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,536
you were at a firm called Viking.

315
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,829
Is that right? Yep.

316
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,457
And the lore is that almost all of Viking returns

317
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,294
increasingly came from Dan Sundheim offhandedly

318
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,547
making a comment to someone at the

319
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,757
water cooler that, "Oh, that could be a good stock,"

320
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,676
or "Definitely don't invest in that,"

321
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,636
and people would be like taking those trades

322
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,763
as their own for the most part.

323
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,890
Those are your words, not mine.

324
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,725
That's the lore.

325
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,559
I never said that.

326
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,393
That's the lore.

327
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,146
And I guess my question is, when someone comes up to you,

328
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,106
an analyst on your team today, and says,

329
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,108
"Oh hey, what do you think of X, Y, Z?"

330
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,737
And you do that sort of Dan Sundheim 30-second,

331
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:22,533
10-second take. What is going through your head exactly

332
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,910
that gives you just this binary sense of

333
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,204
looks good, not good?

334
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,373
Well, I mean, every situation's different.

335
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,543
I think the biggest risk is sometimes people will come to me

336
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,379
with an idea, and like,

337
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,839
and they pitch it for a little bit,

338
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,883
and I think about it, and I give them an answer,

339
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,093
and I don't have enough information

340
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,636
to give them a really solid answer,

341
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,054
but whatever I say they think is like,

342
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,348
"Okay, well if he said that's not good,

343
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,433
then I'm just going to forget about it."

344
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,810
And that's actually not, you know, that's not constructive.

345
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,270
Like, I am wrong all the time.

346
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,897
Even when I've done a ton of work.

347
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,357
And if it's just like a 30-second pitch at the water cooler,

348
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,526
I can say like, "That sounds interesting,"

349
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,528
or I could say, "That doesn't sound interesting,"

350
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,406
but I'd say my hit rate there is dramatically lower

351
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,533
than once we've done all the work.

352
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,452
And there is a risk, like, analysts are like,

353
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,829
they try to take my temperature and if I'm going to be,

354
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,539
if it's going to be something that interests me

355
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,373
and if it's not going to interest me,

356
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,208
don't waste time on it.

357
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,834
That's actually not great.

358
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,878
But I think what Daniel is getting at is,

359
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,464
you seem to have an intuitive sense for companies

360
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,841
and in this underwriting.

361
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,927
Like, it's not just all about does the model

362
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,014
spit out a 19% or a 21% IRR. What is that,

363
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,351
that the Spidey sense is picking up on?

364
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,187
I mean, I think it's like anything else in life.

365
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,605
It's pattern recognition, right?

366
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,275
Part of it is just understanding business models,

367
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,862
understanding what kind of valuations

368
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,864
companies should be trading at.

369
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,869
Part of it is just having invested in this capacity

370
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,997
for 20-something years,

371
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,584
you get a sense. Like, if somebody comes to you

372
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:59,672
and pitches an idea to allocate a ton of R&D resources

373
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,298
to some engineering project,

374
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,176
you probably have a pretty good sense upfront,

375
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,263
whether or not like they should go write a big memo

376
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,305
proposing that or not.

377
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,307
When you interview young, younger—

378
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,559
It's an art, not a science.

379
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,977
Right, so when you interview younger,

380
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,729
say, portfolio managers, or when you meet—

381
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,690
do you have a sense, fairly quickly,

382
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,692
if they have whatever this is?

383
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,068
Like, do you think this is a thing

384
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,320
just people have or they don't?

385
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,865
I think the answer is yes.

386
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,782
So, a couple things.

387
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,410
One, we don't hire portfolio managers.

388
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,453
I pretty much only hire people

389
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,206
who've never done public equity before,

390
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,791
which has pros and cons. So what have they

391
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,625
done before?

392
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,170
Piano teacher.

393
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,922
Hey, glad we're pouring Guinness.

394
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,341
Let's split the G.

395
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,343
We typically hire from private equity

396
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,306
because then they have the analytical skills,

397
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,223
they understand accounting,

398
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,683
they understand financial modeling,

399
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,769
and then we can teach them the stock picking.

400
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,480
And if I hire somebody laterally

401
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,274
who's a portfolio manager at another fund,

402
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,152
that's rarely been successful.

403
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,236
Almost never.

404
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,279
There's some negative transfer?

405
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,488
Like, they have expectations that are wrong?

406
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,531
Everybody has a different,

407
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,576
like, every firm has a different approach to investing

408
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,954
and getting people to change their habits

409
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:17,917
to align more with how we invest is incredibly difficult.

410
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,003
Now, if I hire somebody from private equity,

411
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,339
it takes about three years for them

412
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,592
to really be like contributing to D1.

413
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,719
So, obviously it would be much faster

414
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,471
for me to just hire an external

415
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,972
and there's funds— And what is that?

416
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,975
So like they come in, you say it takes three years.

417
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,101
What's happening?

418
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,520
You know, say they're three months in

419
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,813
and they're trying to speak up in a meeting,

420
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,731
and you must be thinking to yourself,

421
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,317
"This isn't really the D1 way."

422
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,528
What is that exactly that changes in them

423
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,072
over the course of the three years?

424
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,783
Yeah, I mean look, I would tell you that I wish that—

425
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,244
it is incredibly difficult to figure out

426
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,039
who is going to be great.

427
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,459
And even after three years,

428
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:05,464
I'd say our hit rate still is not as high

429
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:06,548
as you would expect.

430
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,511
I imagine if you hire an engineer, after three years,

431
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,553
you probably have a pretty good sense

432
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,181
if that guy's a good engineer, or girl's a good engineer.

433
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:19,019
I think that I have a pretty good sense,

434
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,024
but it takes even five years to really get a sense

435
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,695
because some people start out

436
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,072
where they're analytically really solid

437
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,616
and they work incredibly hard,

438
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:36,245
but the actual intuition of stock picking

439
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,289
hasn't come to them yet.

440
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,541
Is it because you're saying like the job

441
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,377
is so pattern recognition-oriented

442
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,753
that you just need some time

443
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,755
to build up the pattern recognition?

444
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,048
Is that what they're learning?

445
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,426
Once in a while, people come in and,

446
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,468
you know, right out of thee the gate you're like,

447
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,220
"Wow, this person, like, sees it.

448
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,140
They see the ball really clearly."

449
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,184
But that is a very small fraction of the time.

450
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,478
Most people get great over time

451
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,730
and they have to learn an industry.

452
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,983
So when they come in, we will say,

453
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,193
"You're going to cover fintech,"

454
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,819
and it just takes them a year just

455
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,280
to understand fintech, right?

456
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,034
Then they have to see, you know, well why is X, Y, Z stock

457
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,326
trading at this multiple?

458
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,911
Why is this stock trading at this multiple?

459
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,121
What's the market saying?

460
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,790
And yeah, I think it's like the market

461
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,251
is constantly giving you data points.

462
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,045
Some of them are, you know, false signals

463
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,463
and some of them are good signals,

464
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,965
and over the long term, they're all good signals.

465
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,301
And the people who do great at this job,

466
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,387
you have to have some commercial sense,

467
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,931
which I think is like probably just,

468
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,433
you're either born with it or not.

469
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,517
Charlie Munger's money-making gene.

470
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,604
Yeah, I wish I could like test for that.

471
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,646
It's impossible.

472
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,148
But you also have to love the job.

473
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,609
Like, you have to wake up in the morning in the shower,

474
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,612
you're thinking about, like, your stocks.

475
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,322
This isn't the kind of job where

476
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,324
you close your laptop, you go home,

477
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,492
and you forget about it.

478
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,619
It's, kind of, you have to always be on

479
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,995
and there's people who love it,

480
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,249
and if you love it and you have that commercial instinct,

481
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,667
that's, you know.

482
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,419
And you have to be analytically sharp.

483
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,631
Do you have a leaderboard of individual people's

484
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,758
portfolios and how they're doing compared to each other?

485
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,926
Yes.

486
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,136
Everyone has what we call a mock portfolio.

487
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,473
So, every week they have to take the positions they cover

488
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,266
and they have to say, "If I was managing capital,

489
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,186
here's how I would allocate capital

490
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,479
among the names I..." Wow.

491
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,397
And then what happens at the end of the year

492
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:32,361
is that sometimes it's like I own these five stocks,

493
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,948
my mock portfolio was up, and we take it very seriously.

494
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,616
Like, you know, the mock portfolio

495
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,159
actually goes into people's comp.

496
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,953
Sometimes it's like

497
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,539
that person did phenomenally well in their ideas

498
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,041
and I didn't monetize them.

499
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,961
And then sometimes it's the opposite.

500
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,297
But like, it takes care of a lot of the typical

501
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,383
hedge fund thing of, you know,

502
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,135
at the end of the year, like, oh, everyone like remembers

503
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,845
the things that they wanted to do that worked out,

504
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,513
and forgets the—you know. Ah.

505
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,516
But people have to pre-register

506
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,600
what they're going to come to you at the end of the year

507
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,977
and say, "See I was right."

508
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:05,811
Yeah, exactly.

509
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,356
So, I know, did I—

510
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,191
Do you ever have a situation with the mock portfolio

511
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,527
where someone goes short something you're long

512
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,361
or vice versa?

513
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,239
That hasn't happened yet?

514
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,741
No, that hasn't hasn't happened yet.

515
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,494
But there are big discrepancies because

516
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,454
sometimes analysts will be like,

517
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,664
"I think this is a 5% position,"

518
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,332
and I'll be like, "I think you're crazy.

519
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,876
I think this should be double that."

520
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,211
Do you have a mock portfolio yourself

521
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,046
or is D1 your mock portfolio?

522
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,924
That wouldn't be very useful.

523
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,384
D1 is my mock portfolio.

524
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,053
Yes, and then, you talked about sizing positions.

525
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:44,057
Everyone's coming to you with all these good ideas,

526
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,267
because, presumably, they're not bringing you

527
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,854
their bad ideas, and they're like totally idiosyncratic.

528
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,064
Like, some are super safe bets,

529
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,441
some are kind of flyers,

530
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,861
some are industrials and tech and banks and everything.

531
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,112
How do you size positions

532
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,240
and how do you just assemble that into a sensible portfolio?

533
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,951
Yeah, that is really difficult to answer

534
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:07,289
because it is, you know, it is entirely an art

535
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,583
that we're always trying to get better at,

536
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:12,336
and we look at tons of data just to

537
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,795
see what we could do better.

538
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,381
But it is really just to feel like, look,

539
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,593
for every stock there is a target price

540
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,762
but then there's also what kind of risk?

541
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,013
There's a risk-reward calculation.

542
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,390
Like, okay, maybe you could make 50%

543
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,268
but you also could lose 50% if you're wrong.

544
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,937
Sometimes you can make 25%

545
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,814
but the risk of losing money is quite low over time.

546
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,442
And it's a matter of like,

547
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,320
you have to compare those two ideas which are

548
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,531
inherently very, very different

549
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,284
and construct a portfolio which has—

550
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,119
you don't want all names where you could make

551
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,205
a hundred percent but lose 40,

552
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,999
but you probably don't want to have a portfolio

553
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,833
full of names where you're only

554
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,668
going to make 20% and lose three.

555
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,171
So, it's a lot of things that go into it.

556
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,005
There's the risk-reward,

557
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,799
there's the ultimate upside.

558
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,926
There's a sense of

559
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,678
what's currently happening in the business.

560
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,764
Like, if a business we think

561
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,057
currently has a lot of momentum,

562
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,600
I'm not predicting quarters.

563
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,103
But if the business currently has a lot of momentum,

564
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,063
the chance of you losing money in the short term,

565
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,899
assuming it's at a reasonable valuation, is much lower

566
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,610
than if a business—we're often buying businesses

567
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,779
when they're going through really tough periods, right?

568
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,323
You have to be very careful because

569
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,784
often that's the best buying opportunity

570
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,412
but that's the riskiest time too,

571
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,999
because sometimes it's hard to call the bottom.

572
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,417
When you say you have to be really careful,

573
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,545
isn't there a principle agent issue here

574
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:41,216
where when you analyze a company, you try to see,

575
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,719
you try to predict what its earnings will be

576
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,222
three years hence, and be more right than everyone else's.

577
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,057
Maybe there are too pessimistic on the company

578
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,934
and you think it'll actually really over-earn

579
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,770
compared to people's expectations.

580
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,858
But, you're actually really sensitive to what people think

581
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:02,863
in the short term because your LPs are grading you

582
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,448
on the performance in the year

583
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,824
and the performance in the quarter.

584
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,201
Correct. And you're judging

585
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,495
this poor analyst and their job

586
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,872
on the mock portfolio, which you're saying

587
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,248
is like updated weekly.

588
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,252
And so, aren't you not actually looking at companies

589
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,713
on a three-year time horizon because they have to

590
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,506
perfectly perform at every step along the way

591
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,383
and they can't be misunderstood for any short period?

592
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,093
Yeah, the way I think about it is,

593
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,387
any given time we are planting seeds

594
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,347
and then we're harvesting.

595
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,892
Like, there's some companies that we invested in a year ago

596
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,935
and our thesis is starting to play out

597
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,230
and you're making money, hopefully, on that idea,

598
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,026
and maybe you're selling that idea at that point,

599
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,445
and then you're putting in new ideas in the portfolio

600
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,614
that might take another year to play out.

601
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,491
And so, it's not like if we started out

602
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,868
with a bunch of ideas that all had three-year targets

603
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,870
all at once, like, yes.

604
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,790
But like, the portfolio's a living thing where

605
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,625
you have a range of positions.

606
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,877
Some you've had for a year or two and you think the

607
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,464
business is going to turn the stocks into work,

608
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,174
and then there's other companies

609
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,177
that you're buying now because they're really depressed

610
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,011
and really out of favor and

611
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:08,845
you know they're not going to go up,

612
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,680
you don't think they're going to go up

613
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,474
in the next three or six months,

614
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,518
but over any medium term timeframe they will.

615
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,519
So, it's like always—

616
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,229
So you've limited capacity in your portfolio

617
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,730
for the out-of-favor stuff where,

618
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,941
ultimately, you're smoothing this for LPs

619
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,609
where you always need some companies

620
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,694
that are performing and are popular.

621
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,071
No, because like,

622
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,365
I may have bought a company a year ago

623
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,576
that was out of favor, and maybe it's still out of favor,

624
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,037
but eventually, the way economic cycles

625
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,957
or industry cycles work, the company I bought a year ago,

626
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,376
maybe I didn't make money on it for the first nine months

627
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,003
and now it's starting to inflect.

628
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,713
And I'm putting a new company in the portfolio,

629
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,800
which is out of favor, and that will start to work,

630
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,927
it's impossible to predict, that'll start to work

631
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,763
6, 12, 18 months in the future.

632
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,432
But if you have a portfolio of things

633
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,475
that you've built over time,

634
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,310
our monthly returns and quarterly returns

635
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,895
are purely an output.

636
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,941
Like, it is arbitrary in some respects.

637
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,318
I think Jeff Bezos once said,

638
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:08,196
when people congratulate him on the quarter, he said like,

639
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,825
"Yeah, but that quarter was cemented like three years ago

640
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,077
when I made this decision to do X, Y, Z."

641
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,620
It's kind of the same thing with us.

642
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,331
When the stock's working, we probably were investing

643
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,750
in that stock a year, 18 months ago.

644
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,044
And then, you know, now we're investing in a new stock

645
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,173
which hopefully will pay off in 18 months.

646
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:31,553
So one thing you're kind of famous for is pain tolerance.

647
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:36,183
You know, you go through phases of euphoria in markets.

648
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:38,018
You go through phases of pain in markets.

649
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,896
And I was just wondering if you'd like walk us through,

650
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:45,192
maybe across D1's history, the most painful phase

651
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,651
and just how you, yeah.

652
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,694
How was that for you?

653
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,363
That's a very oblique way of asking about GameStop.

654
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,324
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,453
I do have a high pain tolerance.

656
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,123
So, the first three years of our fund,

657
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,918
our fund did phenomenally well.

658
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,711
Way better than I would've expected.

659
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,796
There's always some mean reversion. You expect,

660
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:10,175
okay, the next 12 months are going to be harder

661
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,428
because you've just made so much money.

662
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,641
As we were entering 2021, we had an amazing run.

663
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,893
Everybody in our firm was elated.

664
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,937
Everyone had done well,

665
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,563
they were part of a winning team.

666
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,858
And, for me, I'm always a little nervous

667
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,777
in the back of my head when things are going too well.

668
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,488
What I didn't expect was that the mean reversion

669
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,533
would happen within three weeks and would, you know,

670
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:38,370
be so dramatic that, like, it...

671
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,539
We never came close to going out of business,

672
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,541
never had margin calls.

673
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,086
But it was an absolutely insane,

674
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:46,920
harrowing experience. So what happened?

675
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,463
What three weeks was that?

676
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,424
Okay, so, 2020 ends, everything's great.

677
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,511
We're up by, I don't even remember how much we were up,

678
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,012
but very, very high. A lot.

679
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,681
And back then,

680
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,934
we are fairly aggressive short sellers.

681
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,103
I like shorting stocks.

682
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,564
It's masochistic, but I love doing it

683
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,275
and I've always liked shorting stocks.

684
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:13,113
This is at a time when,

685
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,864
we go back to like 2021, think in your head,

686
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,324
the government was mailing everybody checks,

687
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,118
everybody was sitting at home,

688
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,869
they weren't going to the office.

689
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,330
Reddit was starting to become a big thing.

690
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,959
And all those things came together to create

691
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,296
a massive short squeeze on the order

692
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,755
that I've never seen before.

693
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,341
The way I've always thought about stocks is

694
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,554
let's say I short a stock. I think it's going to earn X.

695
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:41,600
I know that if I'm wrong, it's going to go up this much

696
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,560
and probably goes up more than it should fundamentally

697
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,479
because people are short and they're going to have to cover.

698
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,689
That's my whole career.

699
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,859
I've never had, in my risk-reward framework,

700
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,402
nothing happens fundamentally

701
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,071
and a stock goes up 400% in two weeks.

702
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,991
That's what happened.

703
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,243
And if you think about what shorting is,

704
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,078
shorting is leverage, right?

705
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,664
It's just borrowing shares that you have to pay back.

706
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,876
Imagine borrowing a lot of money

707
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,420
and the amount that you have to pay back goes up

708
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,464
by a hundred percent every week.

709
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,590
That's very stressful.

710
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,093
It's a development market deathtrap kind of.

711
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,472
That was quite stressful.

712
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,433
And then imagine that also at the same time,

713
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:28,355
the American populace is basically all coming together

714
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,233
to think that like, these are the people you should attack,

715
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,027
these short sellers.

716
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,446
And so, it was like CNBC was like—

717
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:41,242
it felt like everybody was behind this massive short squeeze

718
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,453
and felt like it was a great thing

719
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,704
because these hedge fund managers were paying

720
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,456
for what—

721
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,666
That was the surprising thing, right?

722
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,335
Because it's the age-old "in a crisis,

723
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,504
all the correlations go to one,"

724
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,547
and things that are supposedly in your model uncorrelated

725
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,883
actually turn out not to be.

726
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,176
This is the long-term capital management issue.

727
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,427
It's like, oh crap, everything's correlated.

728
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,931
And similarly here, wasn't it that like any one stock

729
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:06,559
spiking 400% would've been fine

730
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,646
but it was the fact that this new retail phenomenon

731
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:13,358
of all of the highly-shorted stocks by hedge funds

732
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,069
melting up together was maybe the thing that

733
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,404
you couldn't have predicted. Exactly.

734
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,989
People say GameStop, but GameStop is just like,

735
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,658
that's a name that people use

736
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,076
because it was the most prominent name.

737
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,494
But like, what was the experience like?

738
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,454
So it's week one, it's up a hundred percent.

739
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,416
The week was like, the experience was,

740
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,667
I was almost like in shock.

741
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:35,672
We were losing an amount of money that was almost hard

742
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,341
to even fathom that you could lose that much money

743
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,176
in a short period of time.

744
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,595
And imagine, like, we were going from being

745
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,974
on top of the world, to within three weeks we were like,

746
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,517
people were saying like,

747
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,436
"Oh, these funds are going to go out of business."

748
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,604
And I am generally pretty even-keeled

749
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,314
when it comes to markets.

750
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,649
I've been doing this a long time.

751
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,775
I've seen a lot of things.

752
00:28:55,775 --> 00:29:00,780
That was the toughest period I've ever had.

753
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:06,494
And it was really stressful to the point of like,

754
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,459
I felt like I was in emotional shock.

755
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,626
Now, I was still laser-focused

756
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,172
and I knew I'm on top of it,

757
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,507
you know, I'm acting completely rationally.

758
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:24,512
But it was very, very, very hard.

759
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,390
And I had friends who were getting bailed out by other funds

760
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,185
and you felt like the whole world was against you

761
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,853
because you know, there's all these people—

762
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,687
It kind of was.

763
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,564
Yeah, it kind of was.

764
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,940
It's like, it was really hard.

765
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,235
What I'd say about this job is that,

766
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:42,155
there's like an asymmetry of emotion, right?

767
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,657
When you're making a lot of money,

768
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,868
it's not like I'm like,

769
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,287
tap dancing around my house, like euphoric.

770
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,247
My lifestyle doesn't change.

771
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:54,167
I feel like, yes, I'm happy that we're succeeding,

772
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,630
but, you know, I'm happy but I'm not euphoric.

773
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,716
When you go through something like that,

774
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,635
it is like— Yeah, it's not 1 over x.

775
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,345
So painful and stressful

776
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,640
and it's not because I'm losing my own money.

777
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,350
It's more about losing other people's money.

778
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,893
You know, it's more about

779
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,103
you know that what's happening

780
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,856
is completely economically irrational

781
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,485
and how long can you actually stick with it?

782
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,362
Yeah, is that the painful thing,

783
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,238
that if you're covering the short,

784
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,365
you know that you're covering it at a bad time

785
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,617
because this is not a long-term sustainable price level?

786
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:32,622
Yeah, so we covered everything at the worst time

787
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,541
and I knew it was the worst time,

788
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:38,962
but if it kept going on for two weeks,

789
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,129
all of a sudden there's a real problem.

790
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,006
And I wasn't going to put the firm at risk.

791
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,591
And I told my investors, I said, "This is the worst time."

792
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,010
Now, if I had held that short portfolio,

793
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,428
forget like from the top.

794
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,557
If I had just held from the end of 2020,

795
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,434
I mean, they underperformed massively.

796
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,269
Like, it would've been like—

797
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,436
You were right on the shorts.

798
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,688
I was right on the shorts

799
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,315
but I was wrong on their risk management.

800
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,776
So again, there's this new phenomenon

801
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,947
of retail melt-ups in stocks, and in particular,

802
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:10,910
certain stocks seem to attract the retail crowd

803
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,747
and the price movement of the company stock

804
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,500
just seems to, like, I was just looking now,

805
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,419
there's a lot of retail interest in Opendoor.

806
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,754
And so the price movement just kind of takes off

807
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,047
and starts doing its own thing

808
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,757
that's kind of different to what's been happening,

809
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,342
how it's been valued previously.

810
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,387
How does this new retail phenomenon

811
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,056
change the short-selling game for you?

812
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,101
I would say that the opportunity for short selling

813
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,104
is better than it's ever been in my career.

814
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:38,938
However...

815
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:40,940
Oh, damn it.

816
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,942
Like, however. There's a "however."

817
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:47,405
However, you cannot capitalize on that opportunity.

818
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,866
Like, if we went back to 2019

819
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,242
and the same thing was happening,

820
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,454
I would be massively short these companies.

821
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,998
But after going through GameStop,

822
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,541
there's a ton of opportunity

823
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:02,795
but you have to be much smaller in each individual name

824
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,590
so that you don't subject yourself to

825
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,134
what happened in January of 2021.

826
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,762
But is this a new kind of science

827
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,431
just like understanding what the crowd is going to do?

828
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,642
Or is that just like, it's too random.

829
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,727
There's no science behind that. It's like—

830
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,103
But you could have the Reddit analytics

831
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,314
and following the tweets and—

832
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,357
Yeah, you could follow

833
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,400
Reddit tweets all day long,

834
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,194
but like, what does that tell me?

835
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,404
Like, okay, the stock went up a hundred percent.

836
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,907
There's a bunch of people who like the stock.

837
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,368
Obviously, if I read the Reddit,

838
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,202
duh, they like the stock.

839
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,620
It went up a hundred percent.

840
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,208
There's no information signal there.

841
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,460
I know that people are buying the stock,

842
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,754
I know that they're buying the stock for a reason

843
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,006
that I think is kind of silly.

844
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,343
The most important thing to me

845
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,178
is that we just have to be able to ride it out.

846
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,846
So, whatever happens,

847
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:57,183
a risk management cannot happen after the fact.

848
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,520
Like, anything you do after the fact is not risk management.

849
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,438
It's actually just destroying capital.

850
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,273
Risk management has to happen before the fact,

851
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,693
meaning you size these positions

852
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,904
so that when it goes up, you don't have to cover.

853
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:10,738
Anyone who says,

854
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,408
"Oh, I like risk-managed the portfolio

855
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,576
because things were going against me."

856
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,161
If you're a bad stock picker, sure.

857
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,204
Yeah, it's like I cut my losses.

858
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,497
If you're any good at stock picking,

859
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,666
risk management after the fact is a bad idea.

860
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,626
So we now size things.

861
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:27,422
So I said, look, I'm not trying to figure out

862
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,550
what's happening on Reddit or this or that.

863
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,180
It's like people get excited about,

864
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,724
one stock is in fashion one day,

865
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,976
then the next week they move on to another one.

866
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,769
I can't predict that.

867
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,439
All I can do is size a position such that

868
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,774
if they get excited and the stock goes crazy,

869
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,650
we don't have to cover.

870
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,485
We just kind of let it go and ride it through.

871
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,404
So is it something like previously you could have had

872
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,407
a more concentrated short portfolio where you could have had

873
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,743
a few shorts that you really like,

874
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,370
and you would have said, "Oh, it can go crazy

875
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,290
and it can 2x if it wants, and I'm still fine."

876
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,958
Whereas now you need to have many more

877
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:08,795
individual short positions where any of them can 10x or 20x

878
00:34:08,795 --> 00:34:10,089
and you're still able to ride it out.

879
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,216
Correct. 10x or 20x is a little extreme.

880
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,842
We don't have that very often.

881
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:14,677
But this kind of stuff happens!

882
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,511
It does happen.

883
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,722
Yeah, we don't trade like $1 stocks.

884
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,181
But yes, that's exactly right.

885
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:22,393
After GameStop, we took about a year off of short selling,

886
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,853
and then I reengaged in short selling.

887
00:34:24,853 --> 00:34:26,355
It's like someone going through a tough breakup

888
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,107
and saying, "I'm not dating right now."

889
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,485
Yeah, it was like, okay, we're going to step back.

890
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,072
I didn't know a 500 mile per hour hurricane existed.

891
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,947
I didn't know that could happen. It happened.

892
00:34:35,947 --> 00:34:37,408
Okay, so now we have to figure out

893
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,327
what kind of windows we're going to put in our house, right?

894
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,496
So, we took about a year off from shorting,

895
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,748
which hurt us a lot in 2022.

896
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,123
When we got back into it, I said,

897
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:47,877
"Look, we're going to have to be more diverse.

898
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,005
We're going to have to be less aggressive."

899
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:55,176
And my view going in is like,

900
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:58,346
logically you should expect that your returns will be worse.

901
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:02,225
And then the question is like, okay, so shorting

902
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,976
is a really hard thing to do.

903
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,353
So, at some point it's like, okay,

904
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,854
if you're going to diversify so much

905
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,730
and your returns are going to go down,

906
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,232
like is it even worth it?

907
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,400
And if you asked me at that time, my LPs asked me,

908
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,277
I'd say like, "I don't know.

909
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,447
I like shorting stocks, I think we can do it,

910
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,783
but this new strategy, not quite sure

911
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,660
if the juice is worth the squeeze."

912
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:24,413
As it turns out, if you look at our short alpha

913
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,291
since that time and since we implemented

914
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,502
the more diverse portfolio you referenced,

915
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,712
our short alpha has been as good or better.

916
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,798
And I think the reason is because—

917
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,049
As your long alpha or as the prior short alpha?

918
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,050
No, as the prior short alpha

919
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,552
when we were more concentrated.

920
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,638
I think the reason is is that you can't be as big,

921
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:43,141
but there's so many more mispriced stocks

922
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,852
that you can have 40 of them

923
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,854
instead of having 8 of them.

924
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,607
What makes a good short?

925
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,235
Good question.

926
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,361
Yeah, like, I mean there's a lot

927
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,823
of different kinds of shorts.

928
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,076
So, the ones we've been talking about are like stocks

929
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:07,039
where usually what gets the retail crowd excited

930
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,043
on social media. Usually it's stocks that have some story

931
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,588
which is novel and exciting.

932
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:18,009
Maybe it's new technology, the revenue growth is really good

933
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,762
and you're kind of analyzing the business model

934
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:25,057
and saying this technology just doesn't work,

935
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,560
or this company's actually,

936
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,937
you know, the founder's horrible.

937
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,522
That's its own thing.

938
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,065
And then you have shorts where,

939
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,195
shorts that we think have like real terminal value risk,

940
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,447
where we look at the company and say,

941
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,740
"I actually don't think

942
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,035
this company will be around in 15 years."

943
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,954
And that's usually because something secular

944
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,956
is happening in the economy.

945
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,750
But does Kodak type stuff,

946
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,959
where like the business will go away,

947
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:54,962
as opposed to Theranos type stuff,

948
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,672
usually where it's like pure fraud.

949
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,506
Exactly.

950
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:58,799
Theranos would be like it's own thing.

951
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:01,010
So there's frauds,

952
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,013
which I used to do a lot more when I was younger.

953
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,058
It's hard to find frauds at $10 billion companies.

954
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,726
It happens, but we're not—

955
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,061
US capital markets are pretty good

956
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,188
for eliminating frauds from the...

957
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,397
Yeah, you'll find them

958
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,523
but they're usually in companies

959
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,025
like that are $1 billion market caps,

960
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:16,901
or $2 billion market caps,

961
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,654
which is kind of below the threshold where we play.

962
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:20,863
Because you can't get enough exposure.

963
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,740
Yeah, I mean a fraud rarely gets

964
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,408
to be, like, Enron size.

965
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,995
So you have the retail stocks,

966
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,039
which are just like story stocks that have, you know,

967
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,376
there's really no real substance to the company.

968
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,710
Then you have terminal value stocks,

969
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,754
like Kodak would be good example,

970
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,674
where you just look and say, like,

971
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,593
here is where I see the economy going

972
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,222
because of some secular trend or

973
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,432
some technological innovation,

974
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,434
and this company's business model

975
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:54,313
is going to be severely compromised over the next decade.

976
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,984
Then you have stocks where you just think

977
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,361
that the business from a competitive standpoint

978
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,488
is just really disadvantaged

979
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:04,323
and it's going to cede market share

980
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,701
for a very long period of time.

981
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,954
And then I'd say the last and least attractive shorts

982
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,498
are the ones where it's like, cyclically,

983
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,500
they're just over-earning a lot

984
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,421
and you believe that the real earnings,

985
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,464
if you were to look through a cycle,

986
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,341
are much lower than people think.

987
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,051
And how do you think about, so there's a company,

988
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,095
maybe they're in a bad place in the economy,

989
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,430
it just doesn't seem like it'll work out,

990
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,514
but there's always this fear

991
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,808
that they get bought out,

992
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,102
or that there's a sudden management change,

993
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,354
and do you just size your books

994
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,231
such that that's okay for you?

995
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,858
Or do you use options?

996
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:39,692
Take over.

997
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,903
I find that, generally, companies

998
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:46,657
that have secular risks almost never get bought.

999
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:51,329
Rarely do I ever see a CEO say,

1000
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,457
"I want to go buy something that grows slower than I do."

1001
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,291
Right? That just doesn't happen, right?

1002
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,086
Nobody wants to take the time

1003
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,047
to do an acquisition that's going to

1004
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,841
invite a bunch of secular risk into their business.

1005
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,551
Maybe Ron Perelman did that back in the day

1006
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,387
but that doesn't happen.

1007
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:14,101
What can happen is if you have a company,

1008
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,395
like the example I gave where there's a company

1009
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,314
in the industry that you just believe

1010
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,274
is going to cede market share for a long period of time

1011
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,736
because of their positioning or management or strategy.

1012
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:29,533
And then what can happen is an activist comes in,

1013
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,535
takes a big stake in the company, and says,

1014
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,829
"We're going to replace the management team

1015
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,415
and once we do that,

1016
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,377
the new management team will pursue a different strategy

1017
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,338
and they will no longer lose market share."

1018
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:47,635
That is a big risk in that category, right?

1019
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,096
That's kind of the only category where like—

1020
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,056
And to manage that risk,

1021
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,308
you just managed your book.

1022
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,602
Do you use derivatives at all?

1023
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,646
I really don't use derivatives at all.

1024
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,940
The problem with derivatives is, look,

1025
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,108
at the end of the day when you break down

1026
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,692
what is a derivative?

1027
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,195
It's just leverage and implied volatility.

1028
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,281
If I want leverage, I can go

1029
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,033
get leverage from a prime broker.

1030
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,202
I don't have any view on implied volatility.

1031
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,453
And the problem with derivatives

1032
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,414
is there's typically a timeframe

1033
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,874
and I'm not good at timeframes.

1034
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,918
I don't know when a stock is going to work.

1035
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:22,753
That's very difficult.

1036
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,506
So, I don't like having something that,

1037
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,924
making a bet that something's going to happen

1038
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,300
in a certain period of time.

1039
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,094
We keep it pretty simple

1040
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,887
and just trade underlying stocks.

1041
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,098
So, I think that like nobody buys businesses

1042
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,016
that grow slower than them, or rarely.

1043
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,895
People usually don't buy companies

1044
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,522
that are market share donors.

1045
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,901
With CEOs, I really want to like buy this.

1046
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,446
It's like, that's a headache, right?

1047
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,321
So there's a stage of the life cycle

1048
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,616
where companies kind of become unacquirable, kind of?

1049
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,451
Those companies, like,

1050
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,910
I don't worry about them being acquired.

1051
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,996
What you worry about, as I said, activist comes in,

1052
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,205
replaces management.

1053
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,250
Usually the new management team can't fix it,

1054
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,171
but sometimes they can and that's a risk.

1055
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,048
In terms of the companies

1056
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,800
where I said they have no terminal value,

1057
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,052
the risk is just that they usually trade

1058
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,053
at low multiples, right?

1059
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:17,183
And so, you're basically just DCF-ing the cash flows,

1060
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,143
and if the cash flows, if something happens

1061
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,811
and people perceive the cash flow is going to

1062
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,480
last a little bit longer,

1063
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,232
because the starting valuation's low, they can go up.

1064
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,029
Cyclical shorts are just entirely different.

1065
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:33,032
The risk is just that you're early

1066
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,658
or you're just wrong about the cycle.

1067
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:35,784
Like, there's something about the cycle

1068
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,244
which is different this time.

1069
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,456
But those are kind of the main categories of shorts.

1070
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:43,125
Speaking of cyclicals, why has Rolls done so well?

1071
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:47,254
Like, they're up 5x, 10x over the last few years?

1072
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,131
This is Rolls-Royce, the jet engine

1073
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,549
and turbine manufacturer.

1074
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,383
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1075
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,762
Main business is aircraft engines for wide-body jets.

1076
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,932
They're not big in AI, IGTs?

1077
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,767
Not as far as I know.

1078
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,519
It is like a little bit.

1079
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,978
It's only a matter of time. They have an SMR business.

1080
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,979
Okay.

1081
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,648
So, that could eventually help.

1082
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,400
Rolls is not very cyclical.

1083
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,777
The reason why— Aren't engine makers

1084
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,529
historically cyclical?

1085
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,447
Not as much as you would think

1086
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,157
because most of the business is,

1087
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,450
I sell you an engine,

1088
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,244
I sell you an engine for not much money,

1089
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,787
but I make a lot of money in aftermarket,

1090
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,788
which is much more predictable.

1091
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,122
So the air framers are cyclical,

1092
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,749
but the engine makers aren't?

1093
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:28,754
Air framers are cyclical, but pretty good secular growth,

1094
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,549
and it's a duopoly.

1095
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,553
Rolls-Royce was just horribly managed for a long time.

1096
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,598
Making jet engines is incredibly difficult.

1097
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,432
It sounds hard.

1098
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,433
A new jet engine. It looks hard.

1099
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:42,268
You're like, wow.

1100
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,019
A kind of idea you think might be hard.

1101
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,147
It probably takes 5 to 10 years to do the R&D

1102
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,065
to develop a new jet engine.

1103
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,651
So, Rolls-Royce actually had good technology.

1104
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,320
It was just very, very poorly managed.

1105
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,282
And they signed a bunch of contracts with airlines

1106
00:42:56,282 --> 00:43:00,077
that were very unfavorable.

1107
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,122
And they had a new CEO come in,

1108
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:08,127
and he operationally turned the business around

1109
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,838
in a pretty fantastic way.

1110
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,631
You guys were long Rolls-Royce?

1111
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,465
Right? Yes.

1112
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,926
So, that's a good example of like, how do you,

1113
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,845
because every management team says—

1114
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,679
Yeah, how'd you figure that out?

1115
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,597
Yeah, every management team says,

1116
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,015
"We're going to turn this thing around,

1117
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,392
and every management team has a projection

1118
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,436
that looks good.

1119
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:28,147
And so, how did you determine that now finally

1120
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,231
they were going to turn it around?

1121
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,275
Okay, so let me start by saying

1122
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,777
the US and Europe are very different in this respect.

1123
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,822
I find that if we—let's take a US company

1124
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:40,534
that had a turnaround, an industrial company like 3M.

1125
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:43,329
3M had been a horrible stock for a very long time.

1126
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,663
Wasn't well managed.

1127
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:51,045
New CEO comes in, puts up one or two good quarters,

1128
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,882
and we owned it. Everybody basically understands

1129
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,969
what's happening and the stock goes to fair value,

1130
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,304
with the assumption that the margins

1131
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,639
are going to go to where they should go.

1132
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,851
The US is pretty quick at seeing change happening

1133
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,979
and then pricing in that change.

1134
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,941
In Europe, I find once a company,

1135
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,819
like a company like Rolls had underperformed for so long.

1136
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,614
I guess that European mutual funds,

1137
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,532
they just kind of got in their head

1138
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,702
that like Rolls is something we just don't want to touch.

1139
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:27,206
So the voting machine is laggier in Europe?

1140
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,040
Laggier.

1141
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,918
Why is the information connectivity higher in the US?

1142
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,212
Like, what's going on?

1143
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,881
I think it's hard for me to explain

1144
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,716
but I've seen it over and over again in Europe.

1145
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:42,721
It's almost like when Rolls was being turned around,

1146
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,017
it was pretty clear after the first year

1147
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,562
that what he was doing was going to work.

1148
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:55,150
And it wasn't really that difficult to—

1149
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,277
Based on earnings, based on deliveries,

1150
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,862
based on talk to customers?

1151
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,448
Based on... You meet with the management team,

1152
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,909
they say, "Here's our plan,

1153
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,119
here's what we're going to do."

1154
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,912
You see things playing out,

1155
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,248
you see the income saving progressing

1156
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,459
as the person said, you get a sense

1157
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,045
for like Tufan, name of the CEO.

1158
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,131
You get a sense for, okay, is this person good?

1159
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,215
The same way you would assess—

1160
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,049
Yeah, yeah.

1161
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,511
Is the right framework that it's US and rest of world?

1162
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,431
Or is Europe kind of uniquely bad at this

1163
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:28,726
compared to Latin America, compared to Asia?

1164
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:33,021
I don't do enough in Latin America to have a strong view.

1165
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,982
But like a Japanese turnaround, would that—

1166
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,567
I think Japanese turnaround would be closer

1167
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,736
to Europe than the US

1168
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,865
but I've done a lot more turnarounds in Europe.

1169
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,491
If Rolls-Royce was traded in the US,

1170
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,703
I'm fairly confident that after the first few quarters

1171
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,164
and people meeting the CEO, it was very clear to me

1172
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,708
that the CEO was excellent.

1173
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,293
And why is that, functionally?

1174
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,253
Like, do hedge fund managers,

1175
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,880
or most of them presumably are in the US

1176
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,550
and they mostly like to buy American stocks, or?

1177
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,511
I think the American markets are just much more efficient.

1178
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:08,265
There's just a lot more capital, and...

1179
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,391
But there are no hedge funds that have,

1180
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,853
very few hedge funds presumably only invest in the US.

1181
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,272
You'd be surprised.

1182
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,106
I think you'd be surprised.

1183
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,692
I think Europe is generally viewed,

1184
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,695
appropriately so, as a extremely low-GDP,

1185
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,821
unexciting place Wow.

1186
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,823
to deploy capital. For peak growth.

1187
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,868
There's an issue where like presenting that to your LPs

1188
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,119
is kind of embarrassing.

1189
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,746
Is that part of the problem?

1190
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,581
Like, oh, we took— Present what?

1191
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,500
Oh, "We took a position in a European company.

1192
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,793
I'm not sure we would want to do that."

1193
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,211
No, no, no.

1194
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,546
Obviously you don't, but I'm just trying to understand

1195
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,881
why the average hedge fund manager

1196
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,634
doesn't just back up into Rolls.

1197
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,010
But isn't it just a home country bias?

1198
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,804
Like, people invest in what they know?

1199
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,723
Yeah, I mean I think it's, let's see.

1200
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,267
I think it's much easier

1201
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,853
from the US to invest in US companies.

1202
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,980
You understand the accounting,

1203
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,649
it's US GAAP.

1204
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,568
You don't have to stay up all night,

1205
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,111
in the middle of the night, to follow the stocks

1206
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,488
when they report earnings.

1207
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,783
Do you do that?

1208
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,617
You're assuming like hedge funds—

1209
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,702
If you have a big position in another time zone,

1210
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,412
do you stay up to watch earnings?

1211
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,206
Or do you wake up to watch earnings?

1212
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,208
I actually, like, without an alarm clock,

1213
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,252
I will wake up almost exactly

1214
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,754
between 2:55 and 3 a.m. almost every day.

1215
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,755
Wow. That's amazing.

1216
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,131
Wait, let's dig in.

1217
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,133
Yeah, there's so much to unpack there.

1218
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,470
So you wake up ahead of earnings.

1219
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,388
No, no. Forget earnings.

1220
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,056
Like, every day. Oh. Oh, okay.

1221
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:32,516
Like, every day.

1222
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,392
Just because I've been doing it for,

1223
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,601
who knows, 20 years?

1224
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:36,603
Like, the European market opens—

1225
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,939
depending on Daylight Savings Time—opens at 3 a.m.

1226
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,359
You just want to see what happens at the open.

1227
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,611
No, I don't want to wake up.

1228
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,281
I actually don't want to wake up.

1229
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,115
Yeah, but you're there.

1230
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,825
But it's just like old habits die hard.

1231
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,203
So you wake up, check Yahoo! Finance, and go back to sleep?

1232
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,414
Yeah, sometimes I'll send out

1233
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,082
a bunch of texts to— Thoughts.

1234
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:57,916
Thoughts for the team.

1235
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,669
People who have no interest in getting a text at 3 a.m.,

1236
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:04,047
and you know, I like, think of things and then, you know.

1237
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,632
Does your team have like a special setting

1238
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:08,176
on their iPhones where it doesn't just like

1239
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,261
chirp at exactly— Boss calling.

1240
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,554
Yeah, like it just tracks an alarm.

1241
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,805
I've never actually asked them.

1242
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,266
I don't expect—if the company reports earnings,

1243
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,101
I expect the analyst to be awake.

1244
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,020
Wow. And I'm awake, too.

1245
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,480
You can't... That would be like—

1246
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,315
Wow. That's happened.

1247
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,149
Like, one time I heard—

1248
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,067
Do you go back to sleep then?

1249
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,445
I try to, but like— But don't.

1250
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,530
I try to but, look, it's like—

1251
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,407
I just want to have a split screen.

1252
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,368
So, you are in Miami, you're up.

1253
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,371
The analyst is in a one-bedroom in New York City,

1254
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,250
laptop in the bed, on the phone with you,

1255
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,919
it's three o'clock in the morning.

1256
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,962
Company's about to report earnings.

1257
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:45,756
His girlfriend doesn't understand why.

1258
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,175
She's already at the couch in the other room.

1259
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,428
And then it gaps down, it's gapping down, it's red.

1260
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,182
We could see the red reflected on the analyst's face.

1261
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:55,974
This would make a great movie.

1262
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:56,808
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1263
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,019
And then what are you telling them to do right now?

1264
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,938
Are you just saying, "Why is it red?

1265
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,105
It should be green."

1266
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:06,818
Well, usually it's red for the right reason,

1267
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,946
and then it's just a matter of understanding,

1268
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,657
okay well, is the stock overreacting?

1269
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,284
Or, what actually happened?

1270
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,912
Does this actually change our view

1271
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,373
of the intrinsic value of the company or not?

1272
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,166
And that's a matter of,

1273
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,628
you know, the analyst is in real-time,

1274
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,338
we're discussing what happened,

1275
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,299
and sometimes we're buying,

1276
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,343
rarely we're selling, but sometimes

1277
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,470
there's a quarter where it's like

1278
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,639
your whole thesis is just wrong.

1279
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,226
Usually, it's like your thesis isn't totally broken.

1280
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:43,146
Maybe the stock is down 5, 10%,

1281
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,941
and you kind of say like, "I understand why,

1282
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,026
but it doesn't really change my long term."

1283
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,988
So it's been 30 minutes now, you did your stuff.

1284
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,407
Now it's four o'clock in the morning.

1285
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,950
Do you go back to sleep?

1286
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,411
Yeah, it depends. Because the analyst

1287
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:59,121
is not going back to sleep, I'm telling you that.

1288
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,914
Yeah, it depends.

1289
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,458
Ideally I go back to sleep.

1290
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,835
It depends how red it is.

1291
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,295
If it's really red, then it's hard.

1292
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,171
Just push through.

1293
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,049
Then there's more... We have to like,

1294
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,926
if it's down 20%, it's not like,

1295
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,929
"Oh, that's interesting, the stock's down 20%."

1296
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,139
What's for breakfast?

1297
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,473
Yeah, I'm going to go back to bed.

1298
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,142
Catch you in the morning.

1299
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,768
Then we're like, game on.

1300
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,311
Then it might as well

1301
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,773
be three in the afternoon because we're

1302
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,902
deeply trying to understand

1303
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:35,073
where we were wrong or if we were wrong, or—

1304
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,366
You might be right at that moment

1305
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,701
and it's time to buy maybe?

1306
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,827
Yeah, sometimes.

1307
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,661
Yeah. Yeah.

1308
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,830
Okay, let's talk about, so you wake up.

1309
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,582
So now it's—

1310
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,416
You went back to bed

1311
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,709
because it was up 2% or something.

1312
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,421
You go back to bed. Now it's what, 7 a.m., 6 a.m.?

1313
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:53,050
You wake up again. And then you reach for your phone,

1314
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,509
and what's in your inbox?

1315
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,343
What are you reading?

1316
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,553
Because you said you're not CNBC.

1317
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,638
At that point, like the analyst...

1318
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,098
Usually when the earnings report comes out,

1319
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,892
it's stressful for the analyst

1320
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,435
because the company reports.

1321
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,269
You're being judged

1322
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,103
on your position. The company reports,

1323
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:05,979
and I'm on the phone with them,

1324
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:06,938
and I'm like— Think!

1325
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,898
"What's happening?"

1326
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,149
And they're like, Do the math!

1327
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,400
"Give me a second.

1328
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,568
Let me digest the information."

1329
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,445
I'm like, "Think faster."

1330
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,113
I'm kidding.

1331
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,698
But not really. But in real time,

1332
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,200
but not really.

1333
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,993
In real time, the analyst is like looking at it

1334
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,995
and telling me

1335
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,289
his perception of what's happening.

1336
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,708
And then by the time I wake up in the morning,

1337
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,419
there's usually a thoughtful earnings review

1338
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,631
which goes through, in detail, what happened.

1339
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,093
And I only go back to bed if

1340
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,261
there's nothing that has to happen that's like...

1341
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:40,388
If we're not going to have to make dramatic changes

1342
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,642
one way or another to the position, I'll go back to bed.

1343
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,936
And in the morning, I'll read

1344
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:49,106
what is like the analyst has time to step back,

1345
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,566
think about it, write things up,

1346
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,861
and then we, by that time,

1347
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,197
we have a few more hours of trading in Europe.

1348
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,698
We may do something, we may not.

1349
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,617
Let's talk about the, across all markets,

1350
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,245
there is this after hours thing,

1351
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,330
and you would know better than me

1352
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:09,292
but I feel like it's gotten even crazier in recent years

1353
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,046
where it reports, the stock can occasionally

1354
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,299
act extremely erratically in both directions.

1355
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,511
I think after APP reported earnings last quarter,

1356
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,890
it was down 13% and then it opened the next day up 13%.

1357
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,724
Yeah.

1358
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:25,559
What's going on there?

1359
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,978
And you'd think it's thin enough.

1360
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,188
At some point, someone should come in and make markets.

1361
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:33,608
Well, look, for sure this is not what we do

1362
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,527
but there are bonds that,

1363
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,362
as soon as the earnings report goes out,

1364
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:40,407
they are effectively having AI

1365
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,784
read the earnings report and interpret,

1366
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,953
and then it's just like, it's just trading.

1367
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,413
When you're staring at that,

1368
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,415
I presume you sometimes will wait

1369
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,666
because you kind of anticipate this thing

1370
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,543
to flop around for a while?

1371
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,712
I mean, we transact in the aftermarket but it depends.

1372
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,213
Like, if NVIDIA reports,

1373
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,966
the aftermarket liquidity is going to be huge.

1374
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:00,760
If a company that's $10 million reports,

1375
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,179
it's a waste of time.

1376
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,138
If you try to buy the stock,

1377
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,598
you're just going to send it up too much.

1378
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,849
It's better to wait.

1379
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,021
Dan's in the business of money management,

1380
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,564
efficiently allocating capital

1381
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,524
to companies around the world.

1382
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,567
That's the job he signed up for

1383
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,612
and seems to be going pretty well for him so far.

1384
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,822
But what we see at Stripe is that as companies scale,

1385
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,949
every founder, every CFO, every finance team,

1386
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,784
they are becoming money managers, too.

1387
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,953
And not in the way that they want or that Dan does.

1388
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,080
Managing a fleet of international bank accounts,

1389
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,833
dealing with trapped liquidity, paying global teams,

1390
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,168
it's the kind of complexity

1391
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,795
that creeps up on fast-growing businesses.

1392
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,089
At Stripe, we believe that treasury management

1393
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,551
should be fast, globally native, and programmable.

1394
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,553
And that's why we're building a new financial home

1395
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,598
for your business right inside your Stripe dashboard.

1396
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,266
You can now do things like hold balances

1397
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,809
in pounds and euros and dollars

1398
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,021
and convert between them instantly 24/7 and at low cost.

1399
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,189
If you need to pay a partner,

1400
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,524
you can send money to over 150 countries

1401
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,109
with just an email address.

1402
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,654
Explore Stripe's new money management capabilities

1403
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,405
at stripe.com/treasury.

1404
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,205
Another thing funds will often do is,

1405
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,915
as they get big, they'll expand

1406
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,168
to other kinds of products. Macro.

1407
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,170
Is that ever something you think about?

1408
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,421
Definitely not macro.

1409
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,966
First of all, it's tempting to think

1410
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,926
that because you're good at one thing,

1411
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,594
you're going to be good at all these different things.

1412
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:28,598
And I think that, in and of itself, is a mistake.

1413
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:32,060
But the thing about my business that I like

1414
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,812
is that if you buy a great company,

1415
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,606
you might be wrong for a little bit

1416
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,858
but time is your friend.

1417
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,945
Like you own it, maybe it has a couple bad quarters,

1418
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:42,946
doesn't go up, blah, blah, blah.

1419
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,658
But as time goes on, the company compounds value,

1420
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:48,034
you know, it grows.

1421
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:52,998
If I'm going to short US government bonds,

1422
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,165
I might never be right.

1423
00:54:55,041 --> 00:55:00,046
It's not like, oh, over time it has to go back to 5%.

1424
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,842
You're just basically making a bet,

1425
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,636
where like in my job, I like the fact that

1426
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,805
if you buy bad businesses you don't have that.

1427
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,724
But if you buy great businesses,

1428
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,100
you overpay for them a little bit.

1429
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,852
You get the earnings wrong a little bit in the short term.

1430
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,856
Over time, value compounds

1431
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:18,940
and time is your friend.

1432
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,900
Macro, that's not the case.

1433
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,360
It's more of a binary bet.

1434
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,612
So you have this story of like,

1435
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,740
it basically takes time and then the market catches up.

1436
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,867
Do you have like any particular stocks

1437
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:32,203
that you can share where the markets didn't get it

1438
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:35,081
for a very long time and it actually took quite some time

1439
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,041
for it to catch up?

1440
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:40,128
Yeah, I mean sometimes it takes the markets

1441
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:44,049
like years to really get it.

1442
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,425
What's an example?

1443
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,302
I mean, Netflix is an example.

1444
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,638
If you really like—

1445
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,391
And is the "get it" moment the multiple expansion moment?

1446
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,225
Yes. Okay.

1447
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,685
So that's really

1448
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,644
the thing, right? Yeah.

1449
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,021
The interesting thing about

1450
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,356
when people don't get it.

1451
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:03,151
So, if I told you what's logical, okay?

1452
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,113
Let's say you have a company, here's a good example.

1453
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:10,158
Booking.com, which was called Priceline

1454
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:11,493
back when I owned it.

1455
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,286
It was growing 40% a year

1456
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,121
and it traded at nine times earnings.

1457
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,874
Why did it trade at nine times earnings?

1458
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,918
It traded nine times when it was growing 40% a year?

1459
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:20,752
Correct.

1460
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,463
That's not meant to be an occupied corner of the—

1461
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,175
Yes, it didn't make a lot of sense.

1462
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,344
But like the narrative back then was like, okay,

1463
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,178
they're just like arbing Google

1464
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,723
and this is like a flimsy business model, whatever.

1465
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:37,560
Now, you know, years go by.

1466
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,187
I don't know how fast Booking is growing

1467
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,814
right off the top of my head

1468
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,648
but I imagine it's single digits.

1469
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:42,816
High teens, I think.

1470
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,401
Is it that fast? Okay.

1471
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,361
I'd be surprised if it's still growing high teens,

1472
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:49,197
but it's a lot slower than it used to be

1473
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:52,200
and it trades at like 3x the multiple, right?

1474
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,120
So like, the multiple should be correlated with growth rate,

1475
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,081
but sometimes the market is just so skeptical

1476
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,960
about the business model that even as the business slows,

1477
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,877
the multiple goes up.

1478
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,212
So would it be fair to say that D1 makes-

1479
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:06,131
I think Meta is trading at a higher multiple

1480
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,007
than it did for the last 10 years.

1481
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:12,178
And we'd have to look, like don't take that as fact

1482
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:16,057
but I would say Meta's multiple has expanded over time,

1483
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:18,309
even though, just with the law of large numbers,

1484
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:22,313
it's still growing incredibly fast for its size,

1485
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,941
but it's growing slower than it was 10 years ago.

1486
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,736
But now, I think for Meta's whole life

1487
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,656
there was a lot of question about the moat

1488
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,283
and TikTok and this and that,

1489
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,493
and now it's growing slower,

1490
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,245
but it has a much higher multiple.

1491
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,164
But would it be fair to say that D1 makes

1492
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,959
most of its money on this concept of multiple expansion?

1493
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,377
Like, is that the actual trade?

1494
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:45,670
Yeah, so that's what I wanted to ask about,

1495
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,423
because Ben Graham talks about the voting machine

1496
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,842
versus the weighing machine, and if I read a D1 memo,

1497
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,095
it'll all talk about company fundamentals

1498
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,764
voting machine stuff where

1499
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,600
Siemens Energy is a great business

1500
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,934
and like there's going to be so many turbine orders

1501
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,936
because of AI and the wind thing is complex

1502
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,230
but it's actually grand, and whatever.

1503
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:09,235
But over a one-year period, the largest part of stock moves,

1504
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:12,489
as Daniel is saying, will be multiple expansion,

1505
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,406
which is basically sentiment.

1506
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,618
And so, aren't you actually in the sentiment—

1507
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,204
Is it vibes? Are you kind of vibe trading?

1508
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,789
Yeah, I mean I like to think of myself

1509
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:25,502
as being a little more academic than vibe trading.

1510
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:30,131
But, look, I think that you're always going to

1511
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,550
make the most money from multiple expansion.

1512
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:36,971
Just like it's hard to have that differentiated a view

1513
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,348
on a company's growth rate.

1514
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:41,142
You can have differentiated view on the longevity

1515
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:45,063
of the growth rate or the ultimate margin profile

1516
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:49,025
of the company based upon some work you've done.

1517
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:53,154
But the multiple over the long term

1518
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:57,450
is a function of the perception of the stability

1519
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,285
of the cash flows over the long term.

1520
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:02,163
And sometimes people are skeptical of a business model,

1521
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:04,123
and then over time it gets proven out

1522
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,625
that the business model doesn't deserve

1523
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,920
to have that skepticism, and then the multiple expands.

1524
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,130
You do make most of your money on multiple expansion.

1525
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,423
And that's why I said at the beginning,

1526
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,551
we talked about

1527
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,262
like actually gauging what is the right multiple

1528
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,805
for a business is quite hard.

1529
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,932
And when I sell companies too early,

1530
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,393
it's almost always because we use too low

1531
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,894
of a multiple at exit.

1532
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,021
If I'm a non-profit that you want to help out

1533
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:30,567
and I say we need to put all our money into a single stock

1534
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,944
for the next, and we're not going to touch it,

1535
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,654
we're actually going to lock it up contractually

1536
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:38,116
for the next 10 years. What would you recommend?

1537
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:41,494
I think if we start like narrowing it down,

1538
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,121
there's very few tech companies I would say

1539
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,123
I feel comfortable saying

1540
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:48,334
because I just think tech just changes too quickly.

1541
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,794
So, it wouldn't be a tech company.

1542
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:53,506
It would have to be a company with like a moat

1543
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,551
that I just felt like would be incredibly difficult

1544
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:00,847
to penetrate with a growth rate that was probably

1545
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,933
not like super high but well above GDP

1546
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,268
for a long period of time.

1547
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,397
And you're including valuation in this equation?

1548
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,648
Yeah, we're just going to buy a stock

1549
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,400
for our non-profit endowment now,

1550
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,402
and then in 10 years time we're going to sell it.

1551
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,739
It's an odd trading strategy

1552
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,699
but we're in the non-profit business,

1553
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,700
not the investment business.

1554
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,244
I like Siemens Energy quite a bit.

1555
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:26,372
I think that you may get a lot of the multiple expansion

1556
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,625
in the next two years, and then the next eight years

1557
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,251
might be less exciting, but—

1558
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,712
We're not even going to look at it over the 10-year period.

1559
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,798
There's a company called Clean Harbors

1560
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,761
which I like a lot, which is they do hazardous waste

1561
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,387
and they own the majority of the incinerators

1562
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,221
in the United States.

1563
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,933
You can't really build more incinerators because of NIMBY.

1564
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:49,145
And as you have more onshoring,

1565
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,439
there's going to be more hazardous waste,

1566
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,733
and they have both the incinerators

1567
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,402
and they have the network to go collect.

1568
01:00:56,402 --> 01:01:00,073
And so it's just a very, very good business.

1569
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:02,450
And the starting multiple is pretty reasonable.

1570
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,911
And I think I can grow earnings

1571
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,746
well into the teens for 10 years.

1572
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:11,334
I would tell you like I think that predicting things

1573
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,670
beyond three years is incredibly difficult.

1574
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,922
I've seen more instances in my career

1575
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:20,927
where things change in a way you just couldn't expect.

1576
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:26,307
And that happens all the time.

1577
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,020
So, 10 years is hard.

1578
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,564
Why do you like Siemens Energy so much?

1579
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:38,569
I think that over the next 5 to 10 years,

1580
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,989
first we started with

1581
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,368
training these AI models, and I think we're still

1582
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,246
in the early stages of that, it's early innings.

1583
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,747
At some point, the scaling laws

1584
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,458
will asymptote out but I think we still have years

1585
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,294
of high energy uses to train models,

1586
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:58,089
and then there's going to a really long tail of inference.

1587
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,300
And so I think that,

1588
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,346
and interestingly the gas turbine companies,

1589
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:08,433
being Siemens Energy, GE Vernova, Mitsubishi,

1590
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,854
they're not AI native, right?

1591
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:14,522
So when they look at this, they say like,

1592
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,941
"Hmm, this is like every other cycle we've seen.

1593
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,444
This is, you know, we're not going to do it again.

1594
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,820
We're not going to build capacity,

1595
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,363
and then all these crazy people

1596
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,406
who are building these data centers

1597
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,074
all of a sudden realize it was a bad investment

1598
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,909
and we're stuck with the capacity."

1599
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,829
So, I think that there's a disconnect

1600
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,039
between what people in Silicon Valley

1601
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,875
think is going to happen in the next 10 years

1602
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,586
and what gas turbine manufacturers think is going to happen.

1603
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,839
I think that gas turbines are going to be in shortage

1604
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,215
for a very long time.

1605
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,803
Because all of the producers are conservative by nature.

1606
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,889
Conservative, yeah, their conservative nature.

1607
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,182
Siemens are literally German, you know.

1608
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,850
And by the way, it's not crazy.

1609
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,560
You look at it, you're sitting there in Germany,

1610
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,521
you're like, okay, Masa's putting in

1611
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:56,939
tens of billions of dollars.

1612
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,149
Every day there's an announcement

1613
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:58,983
of a hundred million dollars.

1614
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:02,278
This sounds insane. I am not getting on board with this.

1615
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,322
I tend to think that the turbine manufacturers

1616
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,656
are more wrong than...

1617
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:10,328
Look, I think that the electrical grid,

1618
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,705
in the United States and globally,

1619
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,416
people have not invested in the electrical grid at all

1620
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:17,585
because electricity demand in the United States

1621
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,421
grew at 0% for the last 20 years.

1622
01:03:20,421 --> 01:03:23,716
And so, if you think about the next 20 years,

1623
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:26,594
I think electricity demand will grow at 4%.

1624
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,929
It doesn't sound like a lot,

1625
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,306
but if you compound 4% over 20 years,

1626
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,892
and you haven't invested for 20 years before that,

1627
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:34,560
it's very material.

1628
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,147
The second thing with, they have a few businesses,

1629
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:39,982
but the main ones that are important are gas turbines

1630
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,277
and then products that upgrade electrical grids.

1631
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,488
The other thing about electrical grids is not only

1632
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,906
have they not been invested in,

1633
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:51,911
as you start to introduce solar farms and wind farms,

1634
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:55,832
and people having solar on house,

1635
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,001
all of a sudden you need to have a much more dynamic—

1636
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,795
it used to be you have a power plant,

1637
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,214
that power plant sends power out through power lines,

1638
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,466
to houses or businesses, and that's it.

1639
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:10,429
Now all of a sudden you have solar, wind-producing power

1640
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:14,100
in far away places that then have to connect to the grid.

1641
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,310
Now the grid is handling

1642
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,523
both consumers actually consuming energy,

1643
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,400
and actually sending energy into the grid.

1644
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,111
So, the grid just wasn't set up to one,

1645
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,154
handle the amount of energy that's going to be consumed

1646
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,990
in the United States and globally,

1647
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,868
and two, it wasn't set up for all these renewables

1648
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:36,581
which are going to fragment the electrical production,

1649
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,374
in all kinds of different places,

1650
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:41,419
and require that it's not just like one power plant

1651
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:42,253
sending it this way.

1652
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,714
It's going to be like a pretty dynamic

1653
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,258
distribution of electricity.

1654
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:48,301
How should we be thinking of,

1655
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,094
so if we take Siemens as an example,

1656
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,554
so they make the turbines...

1657
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,430
Siemens Energy.

1658
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,264
Siemens Energy.

1659
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,183
The turbines are in short supply, so the price goes up.

1660
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:59,020
The commodity producer, in this case Siemens,

1661
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,730
does not want to produce more of the commodity

1662
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,523
because of their fear of cycles.

1663
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:05,776
And, so in theory, the amount they can charge should go up,

1664
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,069
the shortage goes up.

1665
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,238
But then I would assume if they don't produce more

1666
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,740
and demand continues to go up,

1667
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,451
the year at which you would get your turbine

1668
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,493
should also elongate.

1669
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:17,747
So it goes from '27 to '28 to '29,

1670
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,123
and then you start to ask the question,

1671
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,792
are there other sources of energy we should be using?

1672
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:24,545
And then, you get into the whole battery thing

1673
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:25,379
and the whatever.

1674
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:26,923
The solution to long lead times is long lead times.

1675
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:27,757
Yeah.

1676
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,217
My question is, as you think about

1677
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,594
what the right price for the stock is,

1678
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,638
is there a point at which like the lead time

1679
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,933
becomes so extreme that...

1680
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:37,767
Because at the end of the day,

1681
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,144
people don't want the turbines, they want the energy,

1682
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,146
that like other forms of energy

1683
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,898
become more exciting somehow?

1684
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:45,191
Yeah, I think it's two things.

1685
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,401
I think one, eventually,

1686
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,654
let's assume that Silicon Valley is correct

1687
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:52,490
and that all this investment is going to be high ROI,

1688
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:54,200
and therefore they're going to keep doing it.

1689
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:57,828
Eventually, I think Siemens and Mitsubishi and GE will say,

1690
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,873
"You know what, we have to build some more capacity."

1691
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,166
That will happen. I see.

1692
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:05,002
I think over a very long period of time,

1693
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:09,131
nuclear will be probably a more viable option for energy.

1694
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,550
That's probably the best

1695
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,678
in terms of taking everything into account,

1696
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:17,264
like steadiness of like the electricity,

1697
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:20,810
environmental factors, nuclear is much better than gas.

1698
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,521
But nuclear plants take a really long time to bring on

1699
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,481
and have all kinds of other complexities.

1700
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,858
So, I think that two things will happen.

1701
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:31,487
I think over the very long term there will be more nuclear

1702
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,364
but I think that like people miss that,

1703
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,033
like the United States has been pretty early

1704
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,411
in building out these huge clusters.

1705
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,873
Most countries in the world that have developed economies

1706
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,542
are going to need to build out.

1707
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,795
Maybe they don't need to have like the same kind of clusters

1708
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,880
that OpenAI is building in Abilene,

1709
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,549
but they're going to need to have, probably

1710
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,800
for national security reasons,

1711
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,969
their own training clusters, and at a minimum,

1712
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,971
they're going to have their own inference clusters.

1713
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,765
So, I think that everyone's focused on the US,

1714
01:06:59,765 --> 01:07:01,892
and the US is important,

1715
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:03,936
but this is going to happen everywhere.

1716
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,646
AI is not contained to the US.

1717
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,480
It's going to happen in Japan,

1718
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,314
it's going to happen in Korea.

1719
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,110
So, I think that the tail on this,

1720
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,488
it may be like any kind of, like the internet,

1721
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:15,865
it may, there may be—

1722
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:18,868
Ebb and flow. Overbuild and then they...

1723
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,828
But if you look over 20 years,

1724
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:25,499
I just think that electricity is basically intelligence

1725
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,922
and intelligence is what everyone's investing in,

1726
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:35,426
and ultimately the bottleneck is going to be electricity.

1727
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:38,596
So companies that enable electricity production,

1728
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,556
assuming they have some moats,

1729
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,183
are going to be good investments.

1730
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,602
And I would tell you, interestingly,

1731
01:07:44,602 --> 01:07:46,479
going back to the Europe comment,

1732
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,150
Siemens Energy and GE Vernova

1733
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,651
are basically the same company.

1734
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,904
There's no two companies I've ever looked at

1735
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,489
that are more similar.

1736
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,450
They have almost the same revenue, dollar revenue,

1737
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,451
I think it's like 45-something.

1738
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,744
The products they sell are pretty equivalent.

1739
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,037
The products they sell are pretty equivalent.

1740
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,873
Like, nobody would say like this one's dramatically...

1741
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:10,086
They're in the same business as turbines, electrical grid,

1742
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,253
and then wind energy.

1743
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:17,468
GE Vernova trades at 2x the enterprise value

1744
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,344
of Siemens Energy.

1745
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,929
Just to give you a sense of like,

1746
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:23,182
and ultimately there's no reason why the margin

1747
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,850
should be higher at GE Vernova.

1748
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,435
The revenue base is the same.

1749
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,647
So, I think the Europeans are implicitly

1750
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:34,484
just a lot more skeptical of the sustainability

1751
01:08:34,484 --> 01:08:36,694
and longevity of this AI cycle.

1752
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:43,118
And that has to narrow one way or another.

1753
01:08:43,368 --> 01:08:45,787
I don't think you can have two companies

1754
01:08:45,787 --> 01:08:47,790
and one trade at half the price of the other one,

1755
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,792
and there's nothing about it that's actually worse.

1756
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,127
There's also the other open mystery,

1757
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:55,381
which is I believe the onshore TSMC trades

1758
01:08:55,381 --> 01:09:00,301
at a 20% discount to the US ADR.

1759
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:01,470
What's going on there?

1760
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,805
How is that possible?

1761
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:07,268
That is also extreme,

1762
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,938
and it just shows you

1763
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:15,192
the US equity markets either have more liquidity

1764
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:16,861
or just a different perception

1765
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,865
of the risk inherent in buying TSMC.

1766
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:24,160
And 20% is quite meaningful for the same company.

1767
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:27,371
But Siemens energy is 50% discount.

1768
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,832
Now, I understand TSMC is the same company, literally.

1769
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,666
Yeah.

1770
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,626
But like these are pretty close.

1771
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:35,546
Well, okay, you raised different regions

1772
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:40,551
trading at different multiples, and you raised Asia

1773
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,304
which is a great segue.

1774
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,138
Asian multiples.

1775
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,973
Yeah, everything in China is really cheap right now.

1776
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,058
You know, ByteDance trades at a really low multiple,

1777
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,852
Alibaba trades at a really low multiple.

1778
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,187
Do you guys do much in China?

1779
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,563
Yeah, what's going on there?

1780
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,023
Is that just a value trap? What's going on there?

1781
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:58,569
Yeah, we stopped investing in China about three years ago.

1782
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:02,198
So, look, everything has a price, right?

1783
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,450
I think that the reason we stopped investing there

1784
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:08,370
is, fundamentally, I have an issue

1785
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,539
with the way their economy works.

1786
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,416
I think the government has way too much influence

1787
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:14,919
on how resources are allocated and—

1788
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,214
Sorry, you have an issue as a moral matter

1789
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,549
or you just have an issue as a practical, capitalistic...

1790
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,259
Practical, capitalistic.

1791
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:23,469
They can, you know.

1792
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,679
I'm not making moral judgements on China.

1793
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:26,847
I personally don't think it's the best.

1794
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:28,807
You're just saying you don't know how to predict

1795
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:29,850
how the market will perform.

1796
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:33,395
Look, I think that what markets don't like is uncertainty,

1797
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,439
and the problem with China is twofold.

1798
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:38,901
One is that the government has way too much influence

1799
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,320
on how resources are allocated.

1800
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,780
I don't think they're particularly good

1801
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:46,116
at making those decisions as you saw during COVID

1802
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,702
when they shut everything down for no reason for, you know.

1803
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,872
And they will arbitrarily decide

1804
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:54,083
which industries are important

1805
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,751
and which ones are not important.

1806
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:59,255
And if you make too much money, that's bad.

1807
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,258
And so all of those factors, you know,

1808
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,510
for a while we were seeing Chinese internet companies,

1809
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,512
they didn't want to beat earnings

1810
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,182
because if you beat earnings, your stock goes up too much.

1811
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:13,394
You might be flagging that, like,

1812
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:16,438
you're over earning and you know...

1813
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,273
Things have a target.

1814
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,192
If you look at a company.

1815
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,194
If you know they're not going to beat earnings,

1816
01:11:22,194 --> 01:11:23,821
what are you left with?

1817
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,447
You're left with a distribution

1818
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,241
which is not particularly attractive.

1819
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:31,954
And so I think that the economy there is,

1820
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:34,832
it's just very, very difficult.

1821
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:38,877
That being said, I think the valuations are extremely cheap,

1822
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,380
and I think the Chinese people

1823
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,676
are probably the most commercial, hardworking, smart.

1824
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:51,849
If you look all over Southeast Asia,

1825
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:55,185
you know the best companies are usually run by Chinese.

1826
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,313
Chinese people are incredibly industrious,

1827
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,106
incredibly smart, incredibly commercial.

1828
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:03,027
So, I find it kind of sad that

1829
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:06,113
what's happening in China is stifling innovation

1830
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,949
that probably would be better than...

1831
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:12,786
Before this all happened, if we went back 10 years ago,

1832
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:15,247
I think we would probably all sit here and say,

1833
01:12:15,247 --> 01:12:17,207
these Chinese internet companies are actually

1834
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:20,336
probably technologically ahead of where we are.

1835
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:23,547
Like, TikTok was... obviously came out of China.

1836
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:26,300
Like, WeChat was like really probably

1837
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:30,387
the most advanced form of social media globally.

1838
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:34,516
But, you know, the way governments behave

1839
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:37,269
is incredibly impactful to companies.

1840
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:39,021
So you think the tech is very cool, but just fundamentally

1841
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,773
being an equity holder there is hard?

1842
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,149
The tech is very cool.

1843
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,318
I just don't think it's progressing

1844
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,569
at the same rate it used to

1845
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:48,364
because a lot of the great entrepreneurs have left

1846
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,657
because they felt like the environment

1847
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:54,953
for starting companies, for

1848
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:55,788
driving new innovation that

1849
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,081
was going to make a lot of money,

1850
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,042
like that wasn't something that was

1851
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,627
looked favorably upon by the government.

1852
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,170
So, the best people left.

1853
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:04,380
A lot of them went to Singapore.

1854
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,924
And that to me, I think that's a shame

1855
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:09,802
because with the right government

1856
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,137
and with the right economic system,

1857
01:13:12,137 --> 01:13:15,140
China should be

1858
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,144
the most important economy in the world,

1859
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,438
and it should be a technological leader,

1860
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:23,232
and I think the geopolitical tensions

1861
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,025
would be entirely different,

1862
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:27,736
and I have a ton of respect for

1863
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:31,949
what China did from 1970s to 2020.

1864
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,909
I think it's pretty much an economic miracle.

1865
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,662
But what we've seen the last five years is,

1866
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:38,664
governments matter and

1867
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,082
it matters what your political system is,

1868
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,334
and it matters how the government intervenes,

1869
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:43,919
and due process matters.

1870
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,088
There's the famous case where many

1871
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:51,093
of the digital education apps were banned overnight.

1872
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,845
Did that really update your view of China?

1873
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:55,639
Yeah, that like, investors hate uncertainty.

1874
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:57,724
And you want to, okay, like in the US,

1875
01:13:57,724 --> 01:14:01,395
can something bad happen to social media companies?

1876
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,188
They get called in front of Congress,

1877
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:05,023
but there's due process, right?

1878
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,693
Like, you know that like there is a system

1879
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:09,069
that you can't have,

1880
01:14:09,069 --> 01:14:12,030
Donald Trump can't just wave his hand and get rid of Meta

1881
01:14:12,030 --> 01:14:13,907
because he doesn't like the fact that

1882
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:15,409
they're allowing people

1883
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,743
to say bad things about him.

1884
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:18,662
And so, when you have a government

1885
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:21,373
that can act capriciously,

1886
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:26,378
that has a humongous gravitational pull on valuations.

1887
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:28,589
Some big picture questions related to China.

1888
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:31,091
So, there's all these charts one could look at

1889
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:35,220
of the concentration of Mag 7 into the S&P 500,

1890
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:36,054
and you could look at the 1970s equivalent

1891
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:36,889
of the Nifty Fifty.

1892
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:41,560
There's the inflation, which seems to be tracking

1893
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:42,644
the double hump story.

1894
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:45,481
First of all, do you

1895
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,524
care at all about these analogies?

1896
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:48,859
Like, do these analogies mean anything to you?

1897
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:50,986
These charts with all the JPEG artifacts on them.

1898
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,446
They're always very convincing.

1899
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,990
I think there's, like, look.

1900
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,742
History rhymes, right?

1901
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,910
And the same thing in the market,

1902
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:01,413
so there is like, it's interesting to look

1903
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:04,500
at what's happened historically to these companies.

1904
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,835
It's dangerous to say, like,

1905
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:10,047
look at it and just extrapolate to the point

1906
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:10,881
where you say— So you can overcorrect

1907
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:11,715
on the chart.

1908
01:15:11,715 --> 01:15:13,050
But then my question would be,

1909
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:15,093
what would be the sign for you actually

1910
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,305
that the bubble is close to peaking?

1911
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,140
Is there something, an anecdote

1912
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,808
or an actual piece of evidence you'd look at,

1913
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:24,728
you'd say like, "Okay, maybe we all believe in AI, but we—"

1914
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:26,063
So you're saying AI is a bubble?

1915
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,857
No, I'm saying I believe in cyclicality.

1916
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:31,527
Like, the internet worked but it was also a bubble.

1917
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,528
It was also a bubble, yeah.

1918
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,863
Derek Thompson said this recently in a way that I liked

1919
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:38,617
which is people associate using an AI,

1920
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:43,622
that AI may, currently be or in future be a bubble

1921
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,291
as like some kind of negative statement.

1922
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:49,795
But because every major tech change—

1923
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,381
the canals, the railroads, the internet, whatever—

1924
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,716
has been accompanied by a huge speculative bubble.

1925
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:55,926
Because it has to

1926
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:56,760
when you think about it. It has to.

1927
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,136
Yeah.

1928
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,221
Because Americans are optimistic.

1929
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:02,099
Right, but it's an AI-optimistic statement to make.

1930
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:02,933
Yes, that's right.

1931
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:03,767
That there will be a bubble.

1932
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:04,935
We are actually celebrating how important it is.

1933
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,979
So Daniel's saying he's an AGI believer,

1934
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,438
and AI's clearly going to be a big thing.

1935
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:11,525
Therefore, is it this year, is it next year?

1936
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:12,359
Like, when's the bubble?

1937
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,861
If you look at like the checklist of things,

1938
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:17,698
you want to like look at for like what's going to be closer

1939
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,615
to the end of the bubble.

1940
01:16:18,615 --> 01:16:20,909
If you went back like a year ago, you'd be like, okay,

1941
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:24,538
yes there's a lot of money being spent,

1942
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,582
but these companies have massive amounts of cash flow.

1943
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,584
Microsoft kicks off a ton of cash flow.

1944
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:32,671
Once you start having debt-fueled investment,

1945
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:36,133
that's usually a bad leading indicator.

1946
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:38,844
Because, obviously, when you have a lot of debt,

1947
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:43,473
there's not much room to make mistakes.

1948
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:46,977
And you are seeing, like, some of these latest projects

1949
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:48,103
are debt finance.

1950
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:51,607
I think that nobody knows, like, I think even if you spoke

1951
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,443
to... I know when Dario was sitting here,

1952
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:58,238
it's like they keep investing in training,

1953
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,574
and maybe it's pre-training, it's post-training,

1954
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:03,452
but at some point the returns on that training

1955
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,121
are going to be disappointing.

1956
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:09,249
And then it's that people will be freaked out a little bit,

1957
01:17:09,249 --> 01:17:10,083
but usually then the next time it's like back to, okay,

1958
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:10,917
the next model's good.

1959
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,463
At some point people are going to say like,

1960
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,506
"Well, we're asymptoting out.

1961
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:18,342
The returns on this new investment

1962
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:20,344
are actually not working."

1963
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:25,349
That's when I think you'll see a pretty big correction.

1964
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:28,060
Okay, so there's the theory that there's a correction

1965
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,105
because the returns to pre-training start asymptoting,

1966
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:34,107
and then there's a theory of bubbles.

1967
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:37,694
If you look at the 1970s, and to some extent dot com,

1968
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:38,945
which I think was really hampered

1969
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:43,325
by the fact that the Fed raised rates into '99 and 2000.

1970
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,660
There's another view of bubbles which is,

1971
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,203
there's an awesome thing happening,

1972
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,663
everyone gets overexcited,

1973
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:51,541
but then some random thing hits the bubble,

1974
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:53,043
and because things have run up so much,

1975
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,878
everyone starts panic selling all the way down

1976
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:56,713
because there's all the people that bought in,

1977
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:58,590
their cost bases of, you know, NVIDIA

1978
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,801
not to pick on anyone, is like 4 trillion.

1979
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:04,596
And so my question is, do you think we're in that mode,

1980
01:18:04,596 --> 01:18:06,640
and is this a productive line?

1981
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,309
Like, at D1, do you guys ever think,

1982
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:11,186
oh, what could be that thing,

1983
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:12,604
and how do we prepare for that thing?

1984
01:18:12,604 --> 01:18:14,690
Or do you sort of think like—

1985
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,024
I think to our detriment.

1986
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:18,819
We should have owned more AI stocks.

1987
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:19,778
There are definitely things,

1988
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:22,322
you go down the list of what constitutes a bubble,

1989
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:24,574
and you can check some things like

1990
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,286
massive debt-fueled investment,

1991
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:29,955
just like people were building—

1992
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,873
What else is on that checklist?

1993
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:32,958
Valuations,

1994
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:37,295
and bad companies trading crazy valuations.

1995
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:38,130
Circular financing.

1996
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,549
I would tell you like NVIDIA is,

1997
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,884
we can have a debate about what the earnings

1998
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:46,596
are going to be in a few years, but it's not expensive.

1999
01:18:46,596 --> 01:18:50,225
Like, NVIDIA trades at 20-something times multiple.

2000
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:55,605
That's, I think, within reason

2001
01:18:55,605 --> 01:18:57,691
and I don't think there's anything I see

2002
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,943
in the public markets which is bubble-like

2003
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:02,320
from a valuation standpoint.

2004
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,989
I think if you look back in history,

2005
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,158
70% of the time you have this

2006
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:07,868
major breakthrough technology,

2007
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,494
there is a stock market bubble.

2008
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:10,704
And maybe what you're seeing right now

2009
01:19:10,704 --> 01:19:13,415
in some of these retail stocks, like where

2010
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:14,583
Opendoor goes from 1 to 10.

2011
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,252
Maybe that is like things are starting to,

2012
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:18,336
you know, bubble.

2013
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:23,633
But we haven't seen like large cap...

2014
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:25,385
I don't think the large cap AI stocks

2015
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:27,929
are trading at crazy valuations at all.

2016
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,890
We're not seeing that yet,

2017
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:34,853
so maybe it's 1997, 1996 and by the time that

2018
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,566
we're in the equivalent of 1999, NVIDIA

2019
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:43,236
will be three times higher, and it's possible.

2020
01:19:43,236 --> 01:19:44,946
Someone said to me recently as well that

2021
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:49,201
for a proper kind of crisis you also need things

2022
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:52,704
that people thought were safe to not turn out to be safe.

2023
01:19:52,704 --> 01:19:56,166
Like in 2000 when the NASDAQ went down 85%,

2024
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:57,000
it's like well that's a real bummer,

2025
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,211
but we did know that we were buying these

2026
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,129
highly-gassed tech stocks.

2027
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:05,258
Whereas, when the debt actually turns out to not be safe...

2028
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:06,510
The debt turns out to be equity.

2029
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,303
Exactly. Yeah.

2030
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:10,180
That's when you get real issues.

2031
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:11,515
It was very different in 1999, though.

2032
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:13,517
Like, there were horrible companies

2033
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,852
which had no real economic prospects

2034
01:20:15,852 --> 01:20:16,978
trading crazy valuations.

2035
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,439
I'm just not seeing that in the public markets now.

2036
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:20,732
I am, just not in AI.

2037
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:26,947
You're a huge fan of SpaceX and a big holder.

2038
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:27,906
What are you so excited about?

2039
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:29,616
What's going on there?

2040
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,952
Everyone understands Elon is, you know,

2041
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:35,831
an amazing inventor, an amazing entrepreneur.

2042
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:36,873
I think people underestimate

2043
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:39,459
how good of a business person he is in that like—

2044
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:40,377
Been my theory, yeah.

2045
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:44,089
It's like okay, yes, does he invent great things?

2046
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:49,094
He does, but he is ruthless about bringing down costs

2047
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,389
to a point where his business becomes

2048
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,307
a natural monopoly

2049
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:56,560
because it is the low-cost provider.

2050
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,979
With SpaceX, the whole problem

2051
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:01,982
with space in general, doing anything in space historically

2052
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:04,025
was that it was very expensive

2053
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,903
to launch anything into space because, one,

2054
01:21:06,903 --> 01:21:11,408
the rocket blew up and, therefore,

2055
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,535
it better be really high value

2056
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:14,369
if you're going to send it up there,

2057
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,872
because if you're going to take a plane

2058
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,248
from New York to LA and every time you do it,

2059
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:20,166
the 747 blows up, the plane tickets

2060
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:21,001
will be really expensive.

2061
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:23,336
You better really want to go up to LA, right?

2062
01:21:23,336 --> 01:21:25,005
I think, so the first thing is

2063
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:27,132
the idea of bringing down the cost dramatically

2064
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,800
by making things reusable.

2065
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,012
Now I think like he was like 5 to 10 years

2066
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:32,846
ahead of everybody else.

2067
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:36,224
Now, obviously, it's more reusable

2068
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:41,229
and the scale of the rockets is getting so big,

2069
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,398
and each rocket will be able

2070
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:44,983
to be flown more than a hundred times.

2071
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:49,988
And so, the cost per ton of launching things into space

2072
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:53,199
is going to go down by relative to

2073
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,952
five years ago, it's going to go down like 99.9%.

2074
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:58,330
It's dramatic, the cost.

2075
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,124
Once you bring down the costs that way.

2076
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:04,586
Obviously, the first order effect

2077
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,505
is like you launch a bunch of LEO satellites,

2078
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,633
which gave us this great Starlink.

2079
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:13,053
And I think that will continue in a way

2080
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,722
that probably surprises people

2081
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,350
in that I think SpaceX will probably capture

2082
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:21,061
more of the global telecommunications market

2083
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:22,437
than people expect.

2084
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,981
You saw them buying Spectrum from EchoStar,

2085
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:29,110
but then it's like, okay, so if you really step back

2086
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,488
and say like, "Well what else should we be doing in space

2087
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:34,532
if the cost per ton is like dramatically lower?"

2088
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:38,119
I value the company based on the launch business,

2089
01:22:38,119 --> 01:22:41,748
which is a near monopoly and a fantastic business,

2090
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:44,751
and then our expectation, like what happens with Starlink,

2091
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:47,671
which is just a matter of like P times Q subs.

2092
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:51,633
But when you bring the cost per ton down so dramatically,

2093
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:53,551
you open up markets— There's option value.

2094
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:55,720
They would say, yeah, you fly from LA to Sydney

2095
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:58,807
in 30 minutes, or we start having solar panels

2096
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,101
in space that are, you know,

2097
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,269
people say data centers in space.

2098
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:04,145
I don't know what it's going to be.

2099
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:08,942
Certainly there will be US defense deployments

2100
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,151
in space, right?

2101
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,277
For sure.

2102
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,446
And then I think there's a lot of option value.

2103
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:14,698
I look at it and say like,

2104
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,701
I think the business can triple without having

2105
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:21,246
to make any big bets about people traveling

2106
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,540
30 minutes across the world or

2107
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,000
data centers in space.

2108
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,669
But there are legitimate, like a lot of medication

2109
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:30,422
is better manufactured in space than it is on Earth.

2110
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:33,550
There will be plenty of allocation over long term,

2111
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:35,343
and that's why I think like it's the equivalent

2112
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:37,178
of Tesla's Robotaxi.

2113
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,015
There is this option value out there that,

2114
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,225
no, Tesla's not an EV company.

2115
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:44,602
It is going to own global transportation

2116
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:47,814
because it's a low-cost provider and it's, you know,

2117
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:50,275
and so I think you have that with SpaceX.

2118
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:53,611
I like it because you have the downside of the cash flows

2119
01:23:53,611 --> 01:23:55,613
from Starlink and the launch business,

2120
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:56,740
but you still have the option value

2121
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,575
of all the things we could dream about,

2122
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,368
which are impossible to quantify.

2123
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:04,289
I totally agree on the underappreciated aspect of Elon

2124
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,999
being the business savvy where,

2125
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:07,917
let's not forget Tesla invented a new mode

2126
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:09,419
of selling cars direct to consumer.

2127
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,504
They had to get the laws changed in certain states

2128
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:14,674
because the current dealership system was enshrined,

2129
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:15,759
similarly with SpaceX.

2130
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,260
For what they do,

2131
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,137
it's actually a very capital-efficient business

2132
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,889
and they've run it in a, you know,

2133
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:22,390
they've built it with profits

2134
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:24,184
rather than venture funding,

2135
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,268
or they've built it with revenues,

2136
01:24:25,268 --> 01:24:26,686
customer revenues rather than venture funding.

2137
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:28,271
And so, I think that's really underappreciated.

2138
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:30,690
I think he's a better business person than he is inventor.

2139
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:31,983
He's amazing at both,

2140
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:33,276
but like people don't understand,

2141
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,528
like he just naturally understands,

2142
01:24:35,528 --> 01:24:37,363
just get the cost down, get the cost down,

2143
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:38,740
get the cost down.

2144
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,700
And that's very hard to compete against.

2145
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:41,826
Do you want another?

2146
01:24:42,786 --> 01:24:44,204
Sure, I'll have another. Sure. Great.

2147
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:45,246
You keep going there.

2148
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,666
You know, they say Stripe is actually controlled

2149
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,960
by an Irish mafia behind the scenes.

2150
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,631
Did you actually, I mean, it's quite interesting,

2151
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,424
I didn't realize until you said it

2152
01:24:56,424 --> 01:25:00,970
that D1 is mostly privates now, by size.

2153
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:01,888
Yes, by size.

2154
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:05,975
Did you expect that to happen? When you started?

2155
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:09,437
No, I did not. I did not expect that to happen.

2156
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,439
It's actually just more a function

2157
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:15,151
of how things played out than a deliberate strategy

2158
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:18,029
for us to grow the private business

2159
01:25:18,029 --> 01:25:19,197
at the expense of the public business.

2160
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:22,158
Our public business went through some big ups

2161
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:23,993
and some big downs.

2162
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:26,412
I think our public business... We are,

2163
01:25:26,412 --> 01:25:29,499
and look, there is a limit to how much we can manage

2164
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,583
on the public side.

2165
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:34,087
We announced a few weeks ago that at the end of this year

2166
01:25:34,087 --> 01:25:36,131
we're going to be closing the hedge fund.

2167
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,799
We may replace redemptions,

2168
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:41,177
but the most important thing is in our business,

2169
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:44,097
returns are negatively correlated with size.

2170
01:25:44,097 --> 01:25:46,224
Especially on the short side.

2171
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,642
Because you just own too much of a company to, like,

2172
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,644
you move the stock when you try to trade it and stuff?

2173
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:51,604
It's not so much on the long side, it's on the short side.

2174
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:53,148
As you turn things over.

2175
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:54,941
And it's like, if I'm $30 billion,

2176
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:59,654
you can't really short $5 billion companies, and most—

2177
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:04,659
Could you not grow AUM and be more long exposure?

2178
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,244
Probably what you'd want to do is,

2179
01:26:06,244 --> 01:26:07,954
and what we may do in the future is,

2180
01:26:07,954 --> 01:26:09,205
and what other funds have done,

2181
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:12,333
is you have your hedge fund, which does long, short,

2182
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,835
and then you have a separate fund

2183
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:16,379
which is like just long only,

2184
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:19,215
and that can scale quite a lot.

2185
01:26:19,215 --> 01:26:21,134
because we tend to hold them longer

2186
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,927
and you can buy very large cap companies.

2187
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:24,554
So, privates.

2188
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:27,307
So what was your first private position for D1?

2189
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:29,893
That's a good question.

2190
01:26:29,893 --> 01:26:33,313
We launched, I think our first private position

2191
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:36,608
at launch was I rolled a stake.

2192
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:40,570
I had taken a stake starting in like 2010

2193
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:41,821
in a company called Lineage,

2194
01:26:41,821 --> 01:26:44,532
which is a cold storage warehouse company

2195
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:47,493
that I rolled off of my personal balance sheet

2196
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:50,830
into the fund, and then we made subsequent investments.

2197
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:55,835
And then in the first couple years,

2198
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:58,379
we did a variety of different things.

2199
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:03,384
Like, some I think worked out not as well.

2200
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,638
JUUL was like a, I'm not quite sure if that was,

2201
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:09,098
it was good and bad at times.

2202
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:10,433
I think it's going to be good now.

2203
01:27:10,433 --> 01:27:13,019
And then, we did Ramp really early.

2204
01:27:13,019 --> 01:27:13,895
That was good.

2205
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:17,857
John was nice enough to allow us to invest

2206
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:19,400
in Stripe in 2019. Yeah, how did you

2207
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,235
underwrite Stripe?

2208
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,237
Because again, we weren't profitable at the time,

2209
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,614
and I don't know, yeah, what does the process look like

2210
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:25,657
for something like that?

2211
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:28,660
I actually started out my career

2212
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:29,869
as a financial service analyst.

2213
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:33,081
So, I had looked at all the card networks,

2214
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:34,499
all the processors.

2215
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:36,709
It was pretty clear to me that the competitive set

2216
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:41,714
in merchant processing was very mediocre at best,

2217
01:27:41,839 --> 01:27:46,636
and that their technology was not conducive

2218
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,138
to most internet companies.

2219
01:27:50,306 --> 01:27:52,267
Nor did they have the tech stack that would allow them

2220
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,394
to adjust to what was happening

2221
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:55,645
in terms of e-commerce.

2222
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:58,439
And, look, at the end of the day

2223
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,317
it was like, I think that there's going to be one,

2224
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:06,239
maybe two companies that actually can provide the technology

2225
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,993
for companies to enable e-commerce

2226
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:12,203
or any online transactions,

2227
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:15,456
and you guys seem pretty smart.

2228
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:19,043
We do a lot of work on management teams

2229
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:23,965
and, you know, huge market, great management team,

2230
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:27,677
weak competitive set, is like,

2231
01:28:29,554 --> 01:28:31,764
perfect recipe for making a lot of money.

2232
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:36,394
So you've got Ramp, Stripe, SpaceX,

2233
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:39,814
and maybe one day of course

2234
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:40,773
all these companies go public,

2235
01:28:40,773 --> 01:28:42,567
but it would seem as if there's like a lot

2236
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:45,278
of later-stage private companies now.

2237
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,447
Why do you think that's happening,

2238
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:48,698
and where do you think that's going

2239
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:51,075
to go in a couple of years?

2240
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:54,329
Are public markets just going to be the laggards

2241
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,247
and all the new hot stuff will be private?

2242
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:57,874
Or will it rebalance one day?

2243
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,793
I mean, if I ran a private company like Stripe,

2244
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,503
I wouldn't go public.

2245
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:03,963
I think the public markets—

2246
01:29:03,963 --> 01:29:05,465
Which is kind of ironic

2247
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:06,466
because you're a public markets investor.

2248
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:07,717
Yeah, I think the public markets

2249
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,844
are kind of problematic at this point.

2250
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:11,804
Let's just take Stripe for example,

2251
01:29:11,804 --> 01:29:14,223
and I won't speak for John. But basically,

2252
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:18,519
Stripe grows earnings, cash flow at some amount.

2253
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:22,023
Value compounds, and they do tender offers,

2254
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,150
and the tender offers are relatively in line

2255
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,568
with the value creation,

2256
01:29:25,568 --> 01:29:28,112
and therefore the people who are working at the company

2257
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:30,406
and are creating that value, get paid for that value

2258
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:33,493
because the stock price goes up in line with value creation.

2259
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:35,078
Now what we see in public markets

2260
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:39,749
is you take your company public and,

2261
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:43,086
depending on what the retail crowd is doing that day,

2262
01:29:43,086 --> 01:29:47,799
the stock may trade at some insane value, right?

2263
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,509
And most people are high-fiving.

2264
01:29:49,509 --> 01:29:50,635
"This is amazing.

2265
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:54,263
Our stock is like trading 2x where it should be.

2266
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:55,681
This is great. We're all rich."

2267
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:57,100
The problem with that is that—

2268
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,559
Cuts both ways.

2269
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:02,855
You've now pulled forward a ton of value.

2270
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:04,982
And so all the people working at the company now

2271
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:07,568
are being overpaid because

2272
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:08,945
they didn't actually create this value,

2273
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,155
that's not...

2274
01:30:11,155 --> 01:30:13,991
and then the people who you're hiring,

2275
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:16,661
those people are probably more likely to just cash out

2276
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:17,745
because they've just made too much money.

2277
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,415
You're robbing future employees to pay current employees.

2278
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,249
Exactly.

2279
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:22,583
And then your future employees,

2280
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:24,585
now you have to give them stock options

2281
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:27,880
or RSUs at a stock price you don't really believe in.

2282
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,592
And so, the stock is so volatile that

2283
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,302
you're actually not being paid

2284
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:35,012
as an employee based on value creation.

2285
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:38,516
You're being paid arbitrarily based upon multiples

2286
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:40,017
which have nothing to do with the true intrinsic value

2287
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:41,227
of the company.

2288
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:44,772
So, obviously it's bad

2289
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:46,315
to be undervalued as a company,

2290
01:30:46,315 --> 01:30:47,942
because then you're issuing stock to employees

2291
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,735
at too low of a value,

2292
01:30:49,735 --> 01:30:52,363
and then they don't appreciate it usually.

2293
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:54,574
But it's pretty bad to be overvalued, too.

2294
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:57,118
Because like, employees,

2295
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,202
if a stock doesn't go up,

2296
01:30:58,202 --> 01:30:59,287
they will definitely come back to you

2297
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,997
and ask for more options.

2298
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:02,498
If the stock goes up way more than it should,

2299
01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:03,916
they're not going to come back to you and be like,

2300
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:05,501
"Oh, you know what?

2301
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:08,254
Hey, I made too much money."

2302
01:31:08,254 --> 01:31:12,216
And so you end up having this asymmetric...

2303
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:14,260
I think it's really not a healthy dynamic

2304
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:15,178
to be a public company.

2305
01:31:15,178 --> 01:31:17,096
Is there anything that should be changed

2306
01:31:17,096 --> 01:31:19,599
about the public markets to make it better?

2307
01:31:19,599 --> 01:31:21,392
So, for example,

2308
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:23,644
Robinhood got rid of commissions.

2309
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:27,315
Is zero the correct amount of friction

2310
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,609
for entering and exiting trades?

2311
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:30,443
This is hard.

2312
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:31,277
I had breakfast with Vlad this morning

2313
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:32,945
and I really like Vlad.

2314
01:31:32,945 --> 01:31:35,114
I think that it's a moment in time.

2315
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:37,325
My view is that over the long term,

2316
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,452
stocks will go to intrinsic value.

2317
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,204
It's taken longer than I've expected

2318
01:31:41,204 --> 01:31:42,455
for some of these things.

2319
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:45,333
Some of the shorts you were—

2320
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,336
I still believe it. I believe it.

2321
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,297
I can't tell you I have a lot evidence that's the case,

2322
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:52,757
but that will happen.

2323
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:55,801
That doesn't necessarily help a company like Stripe

2324
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:58,471
if they go public and if eventually in five years

2325
01:31:58,471 --> 01:31:59,931
it's in fair value, but in the meantime

2326
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:00,765
they're just kind of like...

2327
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:01,599
Whips up and down.

2328
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:02,850
Yeah, whips up and down. That's bad.

2329
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:07,605
I'm not sure you can do anything to change markets.

2330
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:09,815
Markets are inherently volatile.

2331
01:32:09,815 --> 01:32:13,986
It just so happens that at this moment they are more,

2332
01:32:13,986 --> 01:32:17,615
like, you would think that in the current world

2333
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:19,742
if I told you that like we just have perfect information,

2334
01:32:19,742 --> 01:32:22,036
everybody has all the information,

2335
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:24,038
it's at your fingertips.

2336
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,456
Everything should be more efficient.

2337
01:32:25,456 --> 01:32:27,708
Yeah, yeah. Wow, stocks are going to be so correctly priced.

2338
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:28,918
It should be correctly priced

2339
01:32:28,918 --> 01:32:31,170
because everyone has access to the same information.

2340
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:35,174
It's actually gotten less efficient over time, for sure.

2341
01:32:35,174 --> 01:32:36,551
And I don't know.

2342
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,553
I don't think you can just necessarily fix that.

2343
01:32:38,553 --> 01:32:40,805
You mentioned starting your career as a banking analyst.

2344
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,307
How has the banking industry changed?

2345
01:32:43,307 --> 01:32:47,812
Most of the banks

2346
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:52,817
tend to be very dominant in one geography.

2347
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:56,195
They're not like tech companies like Google or Meta

2348
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:57,113
where they're just dominant.

2349
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,115
Like, JP Morgan is dominant in the US,

2350
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:00,741
but like Europe doesn't matter.

2351
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,493
Same thing with the European banks.

2352
01:33:02,493 --> 01:33:07,498
Up until now, I think the legacy banks have more or less

2353
01:33:07,623 --> 01:33:12,128
in most geographies been able to keep their market share.

2354
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:16,716
However, you increasingly are seeing banks

2355
01:33:16,716 --> 01:33:21,554
like Nubank or Revolut that don't have the tech debt

2356
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,515
of like mainframes and old code.

2357
01:33:24,515 --> 01:33:26,142
And just offer better customer experiences.

2358
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:27,810
Don't have branches.

2359
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:30,730
Iterate on product faster, have better engineers.

2360
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:35,693
And I think that those banks are going

2361
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,820
to increasingly take market share.

2362
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:39,822
Neobanks have happened in Brazil with Nubank,

2363
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:42,617
have happened in Europe with Revolut and Monzo

2364
01:33:42,617 --> 01:33:44,201
and people like that.

2365
01:33:44,201 --> 01:33:46,621
Haven't happened in the US, really,

2366
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:50,291
and there's probably other geos where they have and haven't.

2367
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:54,295
Do you have a view on will it happen in all markets?

2368
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,048
Are certain markets more impervious than others?

2369
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,800
I think that it depends how good

2370
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,552
the incumbent bank is.

2371
01:34:01,552 --> 01:34:03,804
Like, I think JP Morgan is a very well-run bank

2372
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:05,556
and the big banks are well-run,

2373
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:10,519
but do I think that they are vulnerable to disruption?

2374
01:34:10,519 --> 01:34:11,354
Definitely.

2375
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,938
But you still buy bank stock,

2376
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,065
so how do you get comfortable?

2377
01:34:14,065 --> 01:34:15,816
Then there's like a more theoretical question of,

2378
01:34:15,816 --> 01:34:20,196
okay, well if all these AI agents,

2379
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,866
if before Revolut and Nubank just hired the best engineers,

2380
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:26,494
and so they were just naturally going to beat JP Morgan.

2381
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,788
But if like AI agents make, you know,

2382
01:34:28,788 --> 01:34:30,539
now everybody has the best engineers

2383
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:32,708
because best engineers are actually not people,

2384
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:35,670
they're just agents. Maybe JP Morgan can be as good

2385
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:36,754
as some other companies.

2386
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,714
That's theoretical. It's probably not correct.

2387
01:34:38,714 --> 01:34:40,758
In the US I haven't seen someone come in

2388
01:34:40,758 --> 01:34:42,093
and be that disruptive.

2389
01:34:42,093 --> 01:34:44,095
But is that because of market structure reasons,

2390
01:34:44,095 --> 01:34:48,224
or just we haven't seen the great founder yet?

2391
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:49,058
It's a good question.

2392
01:34:49,058 --> 01:34:52,645
I mean, banking is not, it's not like,

2393
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:53,521
you have both sides.

2394
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:56,399
Like you need deposits, you need to provide credit, right?

2395
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:58,984
And you need a lot of scale.

2396
01:34:58,984 --> 01:35:01,445
And a market like the US is much more difficult

2397
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,657
to penetrate because it's so big

2398
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:07,451
and the competitors have so much capital to invest.

2399
01:35:07,451 --> 01:35:10,413
Whereas smaller countries,

2400
01:35:10,413 --> 01:35:13,874
like Revolut has low single-digit

2401
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:15,334
market share in every country.

2402
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:17,044
I think that'll keep growing,

2403
01:35:17,044 --> 01:35:18,838
but they don't actually provide credit.

2404
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:21,632
So, I think we're in the early days of disruption.

2405
01:35:21,632 --> 01:35:23,884
I think you roll forward like 20 years,

2406
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,554
there's going to be some companies

2407
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,557
that didn't exist 10 years ago

2408
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:32,435
but are going to become enormously large banks.

2409
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,019
But I also think the incumbent banks

2410
01:35:34,019 --> 01:35:36,814
are probably going to innovate enough

2411
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:39,316
that they're not going to

2412
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:41,152
go the way of like JCPenney.

2413
01:35:41,152 --> 01:35:41,986
Last question.

2414
01:35:41,986 --> 01:35:44,947
If you're a youngster interested in investing,

2415
01:35:44,947 --> 01:35:47,950
you have views on companies but you don't feel confident yet

2416
01:35:47,950 --> 01:35:50,870
in how to underwrite and construct a model

2417
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:53,914
and things like that, what advice would you give them?

2418
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:54,999
Someone who's interested in this stuff

2419
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,792
but still getting their feet wet?

2420
01:35:56,792 --> 01:36:00,296
I think that pretty much with

2421
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:01,630
anything you want to do in life,

2422
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:06,385
I just believe that reading, just incessantly

2423
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:09,972
is the way to get ahead.

2424
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:11,557
And investing's so different.

2425
01:36:12,683 --> 01:36:15,853
It's just like, read stock pitches,

2426
01:36:15,853 --> 01:36:18,063
over and over and over again,

2427
01:36:18,063 --> 01:36:20,858
and then watch those stocks, see how things play out.

2428
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:23,319
The market will be your mentor.

2429
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:27,323
But I think you need to just like, really, like...

2430
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:30,201
I learned by, there's a website called Value Investors Club,

2431
01:36:30,201 --> 01:36:33,662
and like, I just read everything that people pitched.

2432
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:35,581
You want to have some framework.

2433
01:36:35,581 --> 01:36:39,126
I liked reading Buffett's books because,

2434
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:40,503
he has some faults obviously,

2435
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:43,506
but he just he has a way of like distilling down

2436
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:46,717
the complicated into very simple ideas.

2437
01:36:46,717 --> 01:36:48,636
And so I would read a lot of Buffett books,

2438
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,137
I'd read a lot of stock pitches.

2439
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:51,639
Anything I could get my hands on with regard

2440
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:54,141
to like what's happening in technology,

2441
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,226
what's happening in the economy.

2442
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:57,937
And to me it's just like, the more you read,

2443
01:36:57,937 --> 01:36:59,230
the better you are.

2444
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,107
Obviously, the Buffett stuff is very worth reading,

2445
01:37:02,107 --> 01:37:02,983
and there's the Cunningham book

2446
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:05,611
that takes all the letters

2447
01:37:05,611 --> 01:37:06,612
and smushes them together because there's

2448
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:07,988
a lot of repetition. That's my favorite book.

2449
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:09,406
Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

2450
01:37:09,406 --> 01:37:10,699
So that is a classic and a lot of people listening

2451
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:11,534
have probably read it.

2452
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,244
So, all the Berkshire letters.

2453
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:15,162
What I actually only read recently for the first time

2454
01:37:15,162 --> 01:37:19,291
is if you go back and read the Buffett partnership letters,

2455
01:37:19,291 --> 01:37:21,210
so this was, the partnership he had

2456
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:23,045
with which he bought Berkshire Hathaway

2457
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:25,256
and turns into, but this was like a fund,

2458
01:37:25,256 --> 01:37:27,299
more of a hedge fund than

2459
01:37:27,299 --> 01:37:29,343
the C corp that is Berkshire.

2460
01:37:29,343 --> 01:37:30,344
What's interesting is I find it

2461
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:31,512
stylistically very different.

2462
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:34,598
This is the late '50s, early '60s

2463
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:37,685
and it's before he got so polished.

2464
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:41,021
You know, it's before he got so folksy and approachable

2465
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:44,066
and careful in what he said,

2466
01:37:44,066 --> 01:37:48,153
and a little more of the raw ambition is on display

2467
01:37:48,153 --> 01:37:50,239
before he sanded that off.

2468
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:52,825
And it's, I don't know if you've gone back and read them.

2469
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:53,659
I haven't read them.

2470
01:37:53,659 --> 01:37:54,493
Oh, it's awesome. I'll send it to you.

2471
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:55,327
It's really good reading.

2472
01:37:55,327 --> 01:37:59,039
But the original Buffett partnership letters are,

2473
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:01,208
I mean obviously it's Buffett so it's similar in a way

2474
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:02,376
to the Berkshire letters,

2475
01:38:02,376 --> 01:38:04,295
but I actually think they're better in certain ways.

2476
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:08,173
Yeah, he is a brilliant guy, but he actually does like

2477
01:38:08,173 --> 01:38:10,050
to portray himself in a certain light.

2478
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:10,885
The Buffett partnership letters felt more authentically

2479
01:38:10,885 --> 01:38:11,719
Buffett to me. Yeah, they shine a light

2480
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:17,266
on like who he truly is, but it's been good for his business

2481
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:18,684
to portray himself in that light.

2482
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:19,518
It makes sense.

2483
01:38:19,518 --> 01:38:21,061
You can't argue with the results. Yeah.

2484
01:38:21,061 --> 01:38:23,147
All right, Dan, Daniel, thank you, guys.

2485
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,398
All right. Thank you.
