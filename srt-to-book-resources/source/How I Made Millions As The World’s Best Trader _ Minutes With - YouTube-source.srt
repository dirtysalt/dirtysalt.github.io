1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
On the first day, this guy sent me to buy lunch.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,360
And I came back,

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,440
and I'd bought lunch for, like, four people,

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,400
and I give 'em their lunch.

5
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,200
And then I give the guy back his change.

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,120
And I'd recorded exactly how much his change was gonna be.

7
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,280
So his change is something like,

8
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,600
I don't know, £12.74.

9
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,600
And I put it on the desk, "Here's £12.74."

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,280
He looks at it, and he's like, "What's that?"

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,360
And I said, "It's the change."

12
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,840
And he didn't say anything.

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,320
So I just waited. I was like, "It's £12.74."

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,600
And he doesn't say anything.

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,680
He just slides the money along his desk into the drawer.

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,520
And then he looks at me.

17
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,720
He looked at me like he was gonna kill me.

18
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,320
And he said, "On this desk, we keep the change."

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,320
Where I grew up is a very poor area, central Ilford.

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,240
I lived on a little terraced street called Francis Avenue.

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
Yeah, a street full of small terraced houses,

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
the trains out from Essex

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,800
went right through the back garden.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,200
Canary Wharf skyscrapers,

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,400
I think the first one probably went up

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,600
when I was something like seven or eight,

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,440
something like that,

28
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
and then the latter ones went up

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,760
maybe when I was getting sort of 10 or 11.

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,640
And we could see 'em go up on the horizon,

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,960
and, you know, you're forgetting, obviously,

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
'cause London's full of skyscrapers,

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,400
but at the time,

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,360
those were the tallest buildings in the country.

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,520
And as kids we were like,

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,440
we thought they were enormous.

37
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,200
And you could get the DLR, Docklands Light Railways...

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,120
For those who don't know, 'cause not everyone's from London,

39
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,120
it's this set of, like, kind of toy trains with no driver,

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,040
and you can sit at the front,

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,200
and it went through Canary Wharf.

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,920
And I remember as a kid, you take the train through,

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,960
I'd look, sit at the front, pretend to be the driver.

44
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,440
And I'd look up all these skyscrapers.

45
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,040
Which at the time, they just seemed enormous.

46
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,000
They seemed enormous to us.

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,360
And as kids,

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
And as kids,

49
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,240
you see those skyscrapers go up on the horizon,

50
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,880
it is a big thing you kind of aspire to.

51
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,680
I was good at English at school,

52
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,040
and I remember my English teacher would say,

53
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,120
"You have a very mathematical style of writing."

54
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,320
And when I was a kid, I was obsessed with rules.

55
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,200
My parents would know,

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
like, "If you wanna get Gary to do something,

57
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,520
give him a rule."

58
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
They would be, they said to me,

59
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,840
"You can have one chocolate bar a week."

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,720
And I would be, like, collecting

61
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,400
six chocolate bars under my bed

62
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,360
until my mum would steal them one day.

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360
I would just be, I was that kind of kid,

64
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,520
and in some sense I was a natural economist.

65
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,720
I wanted to optimise the rules that I was given.

66
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,800
It's weird in a way,

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
but I had to have a system

68
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,160
and a set of rules for everything.

69
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,720
I mean, I knew that my parents were hard up,

70
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,880
and I think I really internalised from a young age

71
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,840
that I didn't wanna take any money from my parents.

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
I wanted to make my own money.

73
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,560
So as soon as I turned 12 or 13,

74
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,920
or whatever the legal age is,

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,480
that's when I started my first paper round.

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,680
As soon as I turned 16, I tried to get a Sunday job.

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Once we, I got to 15, you know,

78
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,880
people started taking drugs,

79
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,720
and there was a little bit of involvement in that,

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,120
and I ended up getting expelled from school

81
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,680
when I had just turned 16,

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
at the beginning of year 11.

83
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,200
I got expelled from school for drugs.

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,400
I was a good student so everybody kind of thought...

85
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,360
And I went to this fancy grammar school,

86
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,720
and that fancy grammar school is called

87
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,600
Ilford County High School.

88
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,000
You go to the... in the hall, they have on the wall

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
the names of the kids that went to Oxford and Cambridge.

90
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,480
And you just kind of assume,

91
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,600
'I'm gonna be on that wall.'

92
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,280
And then suddenly you're expelled from school,

93
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,360
and everybody thinks you're gonna go to prison, basically.

94
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
And it was tough.

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,960
I was young, you know. I'd just turned 16.

96
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
You're separated from all of your friends...

97
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,960
I remember I woke up the next day,

98
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,840
and my parents were both at work,

99
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,000
my older brother was at work,

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
my younger sister was at school.

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,480
And you're just like, "Well, what am I gonna do?"

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,040
You know, you don't have nowhere to go

103
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,080
for the first time in your life.

104
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,960
You know? You don't have anywhere to go.

105
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,120
And I went and I took a shower

106
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,520
in my parents' old house.

107
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,600
You used to sort of,

108
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,480
you'd get this rubber hose

109
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,040
and stick it on the taps and sit in the bath.

110
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,080
I remember sitting in the bath,

111
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
like, holding this little rubber hose,

112
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,160
and watching them all go down the drain and thinking,

113
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,040
"That's your life if you don't do nothing."

114
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,000
It was really hard to get into a sixth form, obviously,

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,520
because I had all these great grades,

116
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,280
but I'd been expelled from school.

117
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,680
And I couldn't get into any local schools.

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,520
And I remember I walked into,

119
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,880
there was a school near me called Valentines,

120
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,840
which is where a lot of my friends

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
from primary school ended up, going to the local comp.

122
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,880
Their teacher was a famous economics teacher,

123
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,360
and he'd written my economics textbook.

124
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
And I walked in randomly in the summer,

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,240
and I was like, into the office,

126
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,880
and I was like, "Can I come here for sixth form?"

127
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,120
He was like, "What are your grades?"

128
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,519
And I was like, "Eight A*s, three As."

129
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,000
He said, "Did you take economics?"

130
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,680
And I said, "Yeah, I took economics."

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,520
He goes, "What did you get?"

132
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,560
I said, "I got A*."

133
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,400
He said, "What textbook did you study?"

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
And then I clocked it must be this guy.

135
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
And I said, "Oh, your textbook, sir."

136
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,760
And that was it. He accepted me into the school.

137
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,360
I got four As, and I got into LSE,

138
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,960
which is, for those who don't know,

139
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,400
London School of Economics.

140
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,560
It's a super-fancy, prestigious economics university

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,920
in Central London, where a lot of

142
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,560
international millionaires and billionaires

143
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
send their kids to study.

144
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
And I started there when I was 18,

145
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,720
doing maths and economics.

146
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Suddenly at LSE, everybody knew who I was.

147
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,960
And I didn't know it was 'cause of my grades,

148
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,480
'cause my grades weren't the best, basically.

149
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,840
They were good but they weren't the best.

150
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,680
And I said to my mate, Sagamalda, he's a lovely guy.

151
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,640
And I said to him, "Why does everybody know who I am?"

152
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,920
And he was like, "Well, it's 'cause of your grades."

153
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,600
And this guy Salgamalda was number one

154
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
in the maths department in first year.

155
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,120
So I was like, "Well, your grade is better than mine."

156
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,520
And he said, "Well, yeah, of course,

157
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,080
but nobody expected it from you."

158
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,840
Suddenly at LSE you realise,

159
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,760
"These posh boys think we're dumb.

160
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,320
They actually think that we're stupid."

161
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,440
And then I think that sort of,

162
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,400
that sort of lit a little bit of a fire,

163
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,520
which made me sort of think,

164
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,720
"Well, you know, let's show 'em that we're not stupid."

165
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,920
Yeah, I think that motivated me as well.

166
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,040
It's a three-year course,

167
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,680
and the first year was quite easy.

168
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,640
You get to second year

169
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,920
and everyone suddenly had gone mental, basically.

170
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,120
And people had become obsessed

171
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,160
with investment banking internships.

172
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
They started wearing suits.

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,200
People were coming to university in suits for no reason.

174
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,920
And they would, they started,

175
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,960
they were applying for, like, 35 internships at a time.

176
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,720
And they started to speak using,

177
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,560
all they would use,

178
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,520
they would use these acronyms you've never heard of:

179
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,360
CDSes, and CDOs, and MBSes, and MBA, and IBD,

180
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,560
and you'd be like,

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,400
"What are you..."

182
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
And you'd ask 'em, "What is that acronym?"

183
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,720
And they'd be like, "I don't know."

184
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,960
It's just like, everyone would just start...

185
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,080
And you'd just be like, "What is going on, basically?"

186
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,960
And so you'd speak to your mates,

187
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,080
like, "Why has everybody gone mental?"

188
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,920
Because you're thinking,

189
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
"Well, I'm gonna get the best grades,

190
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
I'm gonna get the best job."

191
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,320
And then my mate was like,

192
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,920
"Well, this is internship year."

193
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, okay, what's internship year?

194
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,520
"Well, the way you get a job is you get an internship now.

195
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,040
You can't get a job unless you get an internship now."

196
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,960
And this is a problem, right,

197
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,280
because I don't have my grades yet.

198
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,080
And you know, I'm hoping I'm gonna compete

199
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
on the back of my grades,

200
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
but you don't have your grades yet.

201
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,600
So you're like, "Okay, well, how do you get an internship?"

202
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,800
and what it is, is you've gotta send a CV and cover letter.

203
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,600
You've gotta send 35 CVs and 35 cover letters, right?

204
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
And you know, my grades at undergrad were good,

205
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,640
but everyone at LSE's undergrad grade,

206
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,000
like, A-levels are good.

207
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,960
Everyone at Oxford, Cambridge,

208
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,280
all of their A-levels are good.

209
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,720
So how do you stand out at that level?

210
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,760
It's basically extracurriculars on your CV.

211
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,640
So everyone, all of these guys from rich families,

212
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,800
their families knew this,

213
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,680
and they'd been making sure

214
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,120
they had this extra extracurricular stuff.

215
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,520
So, like, this guy would've been

216
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,880
head of the Junior United Nations,

217
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,840
or this guy would've, like, founded a charity

218
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,720
that drives dirt bikes

219
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,880
through the Sahara Desert for some reason.

220
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,080
This guy would've, like,

221
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,360
played the oboe at the Royal Albert Hall.

222
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
So basically you realise,

223
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,040
you come in here and you're, like, 19 years old,

224
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,640
and you realise, "Alright, I see.

225
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,520
These jobs are gonna be distributed

226
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,960
based on how good we are at clarinet."

227
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,600
You realise, like... "There's no way I'm gonna get this job."

228
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,480
And then you can't...

229
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,440
I would like to say that I realised then

230
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,760
that the world was unfair, blah.

231
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,360
But the truth is, I was 19, I was just like,

232
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
"Alright, what's the next plan?"

233
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,360
Because I think you're a kid in London

234
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,280
coming from a poor background,

235
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
you just kind of expect these doors

236
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
to be slammed in your face.

237
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
So I was just like,

238
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,400
"All right, fine. I'm not gonna get an internship.

239
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,200
So what are we gonna do next?"

240
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,880
I was in the library one day,

241
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,960
and this lanky northern guy

242
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,000
with kind of like a Beatles haircut,

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
he wandered up to me.

244
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,640
I'd never met him before.

245
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,560
And he said, "Are you Gary Stevenson?"

246
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,040
And I was like, "Yeah."

247
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,840
And he said...

248
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,680
I'd never met this guy in my life.

249
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,720
He said to me,

250
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,960
"Citibank hires one trader a year through a card game.

251
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
It's called The Trading Game,

252
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
and if you win it you can get an internship."

253
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,640
And I was like, "Well, that's good,

254
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,880
because I'm terrible at clarinet.

255
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,000
So this is probably something that we can use."

256
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,840
To be honest, I think it's partially

257
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
just because it gives them

258
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,240
a little bit of a rep on campus,

259
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,800
like, 'Oh, aren't Citi cool and different.

260
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,600
They're hiring somebody through a trading game.'

261
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
But then if you actually go back

262
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
and look at the traders

263
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,320
that Citi hired through the trading game,

264
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,480
a lot of them went on to become

265
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,280
extremely successful traders at Citibank.

266
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,960
And I think actually, if you're hiring

267
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,360
30 traders based on how good they are at clarinet,

268
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,080
it kind of makes sense to hire one guy

269
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,799
because he's good at a maths game.

270
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,559
You know, trading is not a maths game, but it is a game.

271
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,440
And if you're able to come into this game and win it,

272
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,840
it probably is a sign that you might

273
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,920
be a good trader, you know?

274
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,240
It's a betting game, basically.

275
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,440
It's kind of a poker-style game.

276
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,680
Basically, they had their own specially-made deck of cards.

277
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,160
So there's some low cards and some higher cards.

278
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,200
We handed the cards out.

279
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
So five of us are playing.

280
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,320
We all get a card,

281
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,760
and there's three cards on the middle

282
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,320
which get turned over as we play the game.

283
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,200
And basically we bet with one another

284
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,280
what the total of the cards are gonna be.

285
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,200
And I knew straight away what the LSE students would do.

286
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
So if you've studied maths or economics,

287
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,000
or statistics or something like this,

288
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,920
straight away, you're gonna do

289
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
this, like, mathematical calculation in your head,

290
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
which is to calculate the expected value of the total cards,

291
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
given the card that you have in your hand.

292
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
This is not complicated maths.

293
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,320
Anyone who's studied maths will be able to do this.

294
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
They'll instinctively do that,

295
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
and then they'll start betting around

296
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
what they think the total is gonna be,

297
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,240
which is a very stupid way to play the game.

298
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Although it's obvious,

299
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,880
because if you know you've got a high card,

300
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
and this guy here has a low card,

301
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,640
and you both start quoting based on what your card is,

302
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,920
you'll be betting it's gonna be,

303
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
the total is gonna be, say 70,

304
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,040
he'll be betting the total is gonna be, like, 50.

305
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,240
And I can just buy at 50,

306
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,000
sell at 70, buy at 50, sell at 70,

307
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
again and again and again and again and again.

308
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,920
So there were two rounds, basically.

309
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,880
There was a LSE round, which I won very easily,

310
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,320
and then there was a final,

311
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,440
where they had students from,

312
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,160
like, elite universities across the country,

313
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,400
Citibanks, target universities, whatever,

314
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
Oxford and Cambridge, and this kind of thing.

315
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
And at the final,

316
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,640
everyone had already played the game,

317
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,200
so they kind of knew the strategy.

318
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,680
Between the first round and the final,

319
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,920
I just didn't go to class.

320
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,680
I spent three weeks, like, obsessively memorising this game.

321
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,000
So by the time I got to the final,

322
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was, like, probably the world's

323
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,360
preeminent expert on this game.

324
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,600
I had the strategy,

325
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,480
which again, perhaps typically of myself,

326
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,680
was to be very loud and a bit obnoxious in the game,

327
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,920
and try and bully the market,

328
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,200
basically, bully the price to go

329
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,000
wherever I wanted it to be.

330
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
And I had an extremely low card in the final.

331
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,720
And my plan was to, like, bully the price up really high,

332
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,520
and start selling at this high price.

333
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,280
Because I know it can't be that high,

334
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,640
'cause I've got this low card.

335
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,200
And the cards in the middle turn over,

336
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
and they were quite high.

337
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,280
So I just pushed the price up

338
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,800
and I was just trading really, really aggressively.

339
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,080
The game finishes and everybody turned their cards over.

340
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,640
There's eight cards in the game,

341
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,240
five players, three in the middle.

342
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,720
I had the lowest card possible.

343
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,880
The other seven cards were the

344
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,000
seven highest possible cards,

345
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,440
which is basically statistically impossible.

346
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,920
It's, like, one in a 10 million chance

347
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,680
or something like this, it's impossible happening.

348
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,040
And you realise straight away,

349
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,080
"The game has been rigged against me."

350
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,480
And of course I lost enormously

351
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,720
because this thing that happened is

352
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,760
basically statistically impossible.

353
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,880
And I was sort of sitting there in this, like,

354
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,600
it was on this high floor

355
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,840
in this Citibank skyscraper, just asking myself, like,

356
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,520
"Why have they rigged the game against me?"

357
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,720
And then the guy who ran the games

358
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,160
comes to the front, and he says,

359
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
"The winner of the game was Gary Stevenson."

360
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,120
And he said, "We wanted to see

361
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,960
what he would do if everything turned out against him."

362
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,800
He wanted to see someone who would back himself.

363
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,960
And he did.

364
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,680
So Gary's the winner.

365
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,720
So yeah, they rigged the game against me,

366
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
which I think is

367
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,320
a little bit of a metaphor for

368
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
the world that we live in, I think.

369
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,080
Yeah.

370
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
So it's Canary Wharf, Citibank.

371
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
The trading floor is only on the second floor,

372
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,120
it's not on the top floor.

373
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
Go in, I was wearing,

374
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
I remember I was wearing a blue shirt,

375
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,440
and a yellow tie, a fat yellow tie, which is the...

376
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,520
and a terrible fitting suit jacket from Next,

377
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
which is the stuff I used to wear

378
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,840
to, like, go work at DFS,

379
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,040
the sofa store I used to work.

380
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,440
You get taken up these escalators,

381
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,960
and this massive, massive room. The trading floor

382
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,200
is so vast, enormous room.

383
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,480
Like, you walk in and it seems endless,

384
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
like, right, left, forwards,

385
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,560
and this, everyone has these massive walls of screens,

386
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,080
nine screens, 12 screens that kind of

387
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,320
go up around them like this.

388
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,840
On the first day, this guy sent me to buy lunch.

389
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,680
And I came back,

390
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,760
and I'd bought lunch for, like, four people,

391
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,720
and I give 'em their lunch.

392
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,520
And then I give the guy back his change.

393
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,440
And I'd recorded exactly how much his change was gonna be.

394
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,600
So his change is something like,

395
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,920
I don't know, £12.74.

396
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
And I put it on the desk, "Here's £12.74."

397
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,600
He looks at it, and he's like, "What's that?"

398
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,800
And I said, "It's the change."

399
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,960
And he didn't say anything.

400
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,440
So I just waited. I was like, "It's £12.74."

401
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,440
And he doesn't say anything.

402
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,520
He just slides the money along his desk into the drawer.

403
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,360
And then he looks at me.

404
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,560
He looked at me like he was gonna kill me.

405
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,160
And he said, "On this desk, we keep the change."

406
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
Just like that.

407
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,400
And I was like, "These guys are f**king mental, basically."

408
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,640
But then I was like, "Fine. Alright."

409
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,680
And then I started buying everyone lunch

410
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,120
because I was keeping the change,

411
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,320
just making loads of money.

412
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,000
And then they started kind of like testing me by, like,

413
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,360
"Oh, go buy lunch for this guy,

414
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
go buy lunch for that guy."

415
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,240
They'd all do really complicated orders

416
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,200
for different things,

417
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,040
to see if I could,

418
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,960
kind of testing me, like,

419
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,880
as if I'm gonna fail to get lunch correctly.

420
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,240
Part of me didn't like to be

421
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,440
treated like that a little bit, but I think...

422
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,920
I was willing to take whatever I had to take

423
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,520
to get where I needed to get, basically.

424
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,240
You know, I grew up in a very poor background.

425
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,280
That job was gonna make me a millionaire.

426
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,880
What is weird is,

427
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,400
you might think coming from a poor background,

428
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,240
I would experience, like, class prejudice,

429
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,360
but the trading floor,

430
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,160
of all the places I've ever been,

431
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,480
these guys loved me from the start.

432
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,280
And I think it's 'cause they have this idea

433
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,720
of this Cockney wideboy trader,

434
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,800
and also they have this idea

435
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,680
that the trading floor is a super-meritocratic place.

436
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,920
So when a kid actually turns up from the local area,

437
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,320
it makes them feel like, "Yeah, we are meritocratic."

438
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,800
And I think also,

439
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,680
like, of all the places that I've been in,

440
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,840
this was the only space where rather than being like,

441
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,120
'Poor kids are dumb,'

442
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
they were smart enough to realise,

443
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,400
"If this guy's managed to get this far

444
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,720
looking like that and speaking like that,

445
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
he's probably got something about him," basically.

446
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
And I met this guy.

447
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,120
He was a very wealthy guy.

448
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,120
He went on to become an amazingly profitable trader.

449
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,360
And then he had his own designated taxi driver who would drive him home

450
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,920
every time he got too drunk.

451
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,920
And his taxi driver told me one time that every time he gets too drunk,

452
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,800
he insists on the way home, I drop him outside the Bank of England

453
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,920
so he can go round

454
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,920
the back of the Bank of England and take a piss on the Bank of England

455
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,880
on the way home.

456
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,960
And I thought he was a f***ing hero.

457
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,080
I work with the maniacs.

458
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,560
There's another guy. He’s called Rupert,

459
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,280
who I think I describe as looking like he was unexpectedly dropped off

460
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,280
at boarding school, eight years old and not picked up till he was 21,

461
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,360
which I later found out to be not far from the truth and this guy was very

462
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,920
which I later found out to be not far from the truth and this guy was very

463
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,440
I think his dad was in the army, actually, like British blue blood.

464
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,920
Like everything has to be straight.

465
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,800
Everything has to be completely narrow. Nobody can cross the line.

466
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,280
Very rigid, angry.

467
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,440
He told me once, he said to me, I've got a problem, which is

468
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,520
every time I meet someone I need to know straight away

469
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,720
whether they're better than me or whether they’re worse than me.

470
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:28,760
whether they're better than me or whether they’re worse than me.

471
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,160
And if they're better than me.

472
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,880
I hate them.

473
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,880
I hate them because they're better than me.

474
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,520
But if they're worse than me, I despise them.

475
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:40,880
And I think I realise.

476
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,640
I think that's why he likes hanging out with me,

477
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,640
because we were from such radically different class backgrounds.

478
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,960
I think he felt that he didn't have to compare himself to me

479
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,640
because people like me just don't register, just don't register

480
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,480
on his scale, basically.

481
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,880
And he would take me out like his little Cockney sidekick, in Clapham.

482
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,000
He got me really drunk one time and I got in trouble

483
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,640
because I come in the next day, I threw up, I'd to go to the bathroom

484
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,720
I got sent home and the next day I come in really early.

485
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
And the boss, Caleb, said to this guy, Rupert,

486
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,040
“Gary said it was your fault that you got him drunk.”

487
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,280
There was an empty seat next to me and he was once sit there

488
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,560
and I just thought, “Don't look at him because he'll be going mental.”

489
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,320
Gently, at first, I heard him like, like growling

490
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
slightly growling

491
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,240
like this.

492
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,200
And I just thought “Just don’t look at him.”

493
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,320
He starts growling like louder and louder and louder.

494
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,320
And I was just really trying not to look until he was growling so loudly

495
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,200
I thought, like, “I’d better look at him.”

496
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,880
I heard this bang and he kicked the

497
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,040
we had these doors, the computer, like towers behind the doors.

498
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,800
He kicked the doors and then go bang against the bracket.

499
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,720
And I looked around at him.

500
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,760
He was turned around to me and he was gnashing his teeth.

501
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,080
“Ahr, ahr”, like that. Like a like a dog, like a wolf,

502
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,400
like growling, barking at me in front of everyone

503
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,880
for like 20 seconds.

504
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,040
This is a room full of millionaires.

505
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,320
People get paid £1,000,000 a year to do this.

506
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,680
I don't want to point fingers too much at these guys individuals

507
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,560
because they're not all bad guys. They're real people

508
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,160
at the end of the day. I think for me, it's

509
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,720
it’s a crazy space and I think it's the space that makes the people go crazy.

510
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,480
My first big bonus was when I was,

511
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,640
was in the beginning of 2010 when I'd just turned 23.

512
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,200
And that was just under £400,000.

513
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,040
And that was so much more than I had been expecting.

514
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,760
I knew traders made a lot of money,

515
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,560
but I think people from my background,

516
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,680
when they think of a lot of money,

517
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,120
they think of, like, a hundred grand.

518
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,480
They think "Oh my God, a hundred grand."

519
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,520
A hundred grand is a lot of money.

520
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,880
And that's what I thought these guys were making.

521
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,960
And in fact, that had been my aim, to make a hundred grand,

522
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,800
and I'd ask my boss,

523
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,440
"What do I need to do to make a hundred grand?"

524
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,680
And he told me, "Make $10 million for Citibank."

525
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,760
So I made $12 million and I got paid this 400 grand.

526
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
And I think it was that bonus when I was 23

527
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
that kind of blew my mind.

528
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
Well, I lost $8 million in a week when it,

529
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,360
when I was, in 2010, when I was still 23.

530
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,640
I lost $8 million in a week.

531
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,080
And that was mad, 'cause I graduated 2008.

532
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,480
So a lot of my mates couldn't get jobs.

533
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,040
Obviously that was the financial crisis, right?

534
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,640
And I was halfway through this week by that point.

535
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,320
I had already lost, like, $5 million in three days.

536
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,800
And all my mates were round just playing Pro Evolution.

537
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,320
And you're just thinking, like,

538
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,000
"I've lost $5 million."

539
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,360
Like, how much more can I lose

540
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,000
before I lose my job?"

541
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,080
It really dehumanises you.

542
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,240
It's the stress and the pressure of it.

543
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,280
And it really, for me,

544
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
it really separated me from my,

545
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
from my friends and my family.

546
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,080
You can't turn round and tell them,

547
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,720
"I lost $5 million this week."

548
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,960
You know, they're not gonna understand.

549
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,720
And also, like, you don't want to be a d**k.

550
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,600
You know what I mean?

551
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
But at the same time, you can't think about nothing else.

552
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,760
You can't think about nothing else.

553
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,520
And then I got called into a meeting early 2011

554
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
with one of Citibank's top economists.

555
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,560
And he went through the financial situation

556
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,800
of a lot of the world's governments.

557
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,880
So I don't know if you remember, in 2011,

558
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,680
there was this big crisis

559
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,480
with the governments of Italy, Spain,

560
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,240
Portugal, Greece, Ireland.

561
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,320
This is before that kicked off.

562
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,760
And it was, like, all of these governments

563
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,240
going massively into debt.

564
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,000
Every year, they're spending more than they can make.

565
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,280
They having to sell off their assets,

566
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,400
their debts are exploding.

567
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,440
You know, including the governments of the UK,

568
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,520
the US, Japan, these are the biggest

569
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,880
governments in the world, you know.

570
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,480
And I come out of that meeting, and I was like,

571
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,600
"How can it be that my friends

572
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,000
are losing their houses and going into debt?"

573
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,840
Their families are doing that.

574
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,000
The world's governments

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
are losing their assets and going into debt.

576
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,360
Where are the assets going?

577
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,080
Who is the debt to?

578
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,920
It's not possible.

579
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,800
We can't all go into debt.

580
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,720
Somebody has to be on the other side of that.

581
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
We can't all lose our assets,

582
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,840
somebody has to be getting the assets.

583
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
And I was sitting there.

584
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,800
I used to have to take the sandwiches to that meeting.

585
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,360
So I'd had all these sandwiches around me

586
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,440
sitting on the desk coming out of this meeting,

587
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,120
where you realise, like,

588
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,920
all of the governments in the world

589
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,400
are totally f**ked, basically.

590
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,480
And you look around,

591
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
and you're surrounded by these, like,

592
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,760
fat millionaires in pink shirts,

593
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,320
and you realise, like,

594
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,200
"It's us, isn't it?

595
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,360
We are, we are the guys who are accumulating..."

596
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,000
You know, I myself was on the verge

597
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,160
of becoming a millionaire at that point.

598
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,000
You know what I mean?

599
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,800
You realise, "This is it.

600
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,280
We are accumulating the assets from the middle class,

601
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,920
from the government."

602
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,000
And then you realise it's not gonna get better,

603
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,920
because if the middle class families

604
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,880
can't afford to pay the bills

605
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
when they own their own house,

606
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,280
or their kids definitely won't

607
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,520
when they don't own their own houses,

608
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,040
if governments can't run a balanced budget

609
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,200
when they're not massively in debt,

610
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,000
well, they definitely can't when they are massively in debt.

611
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,040
And what I saw in that moment was it was gonna spiral,

612
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,720
it's gonna get worse and worse and worse.

613
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,920
That wealth would continue to be

614
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,000
sucked out of the middle class and towards the rich.

615
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,760
And I realised straight away,

616
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,680
that there would never be an economic recovery.

617
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,160
And I put this massive bet on...

618
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,600
I was an interest rates trader.

619
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,400
So my specific bet was that interest rates

620
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,080
would stay zero for, like, three years.

621
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,920
Everybody thought interest rates

622
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
were gonna come up really quickly.

623
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,640
And that bet was super-successful, basically.

624
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,560
And I made $35 million for the bank,

625
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,440
and I got paid $1 million myself,

626
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,360
basically on the back of this bet that

627
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,600
the global economy would collapse,

628
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,520
and that society would collapse.

629
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,480
Suddenly I was a multimillionaire

630
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,080
surrounded by multimillionaires,

631
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,920
betting the economy was gonna collapse.

632
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,880
And I just thought, "What the f**k am I doing here?

633
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,000
Why am I here?

634
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,880
I don't need any more money."

635
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,080
But at the same time,

636
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
I'd worked so hard to get to that space.

637
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,520
You know what I mean?

638
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,240
And I was the best trader in the world at that point.

639
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,840
And you're getting paid millions of dollars a year.

640
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,960
You don't wanna walk away from it.

641
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,840
But I think this is the,

642
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,680
that is the point in my career

643
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,560
and in my life where this voice starts to come in,

644
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,320
that says, "Is it right to be doing this?"

645
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
I don't think it's wrong for poor people

646
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,440
to do what they have to do to make money,

647
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,200
as long as you're not directly hurting no one.

648
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,280
I think rich people should be giving more.

649
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,160
I think rich people should be doing more.

650
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,960
And at that stage of my life,

651
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,800
I wasn't a poor person anymore, I was a rich person.

652
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,640
And I think I knew in my heart

653
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,440
I had to be doing more as well.

654
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,760
I got called into a meeting with my boss.

655
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,280
The thing is this, I hated that boss.

656
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,920
I really hated him,

657
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,480
but I had to laugh at his jokes for six months.

658
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,840
And then suddenly I get this bonus,

659
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,680
and I don't have to laugh at the guy's jokes no more.

660
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,080
And I was just ripping the p**s out of this guy every day.

661
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,840
And we start to argue a lot.

662
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,360
And he called me into his office,

663
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,240
and he was shouting at me, screaming at me.

664
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,360
And then I just thought,

665
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,760
"What the f**k am I doing?

666
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,960
What am I f**king doing?"

667
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,880
And I just looked up to my boss and said,

668
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,080
"I need to quit."

669
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,440
And my boss was like...

670
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,640
'Cause at that time I was Citibank's

671
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,680
top trader in the world.

672
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,480
And then senior management went mental,

673
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,800
and eventually they decided,

674
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,160
"Okay, don't quit.

675
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,640
We're gonna move you to Tokyo."

676
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
And I thought at the time that was a bad idea,

677
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,120
but I thought, I said to him,

678
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,320
"I don't think that's a good idea."

679
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,360
And he said to me, "You don't understand, you have to go."

680
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,680
And I was like, "Well, if you're gonna be a d**k about it,

681
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,200
then I'll go and take another f**king bonus then."

682
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Which I did.

683
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,120
And I moved to Tokyo.

684
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,280
And that begins the final fight, you could say,

685
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,320
between me and Citibank, me leaving the bank.

686
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,640
I went through a difficult couple of years leaving.

687
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,720
It wasn't easy to leave.

688
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,080
But it was nice that that happened in Tokyo.

689
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,840
I basically had two years of, like, cycling around Tokyo,

690
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,120
eating ramen in little, like, corner ramen bars,

691
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
thinking about what it means

692
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,800
to be walking away from a $2-million-a-year job.

693
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,480
It was weird, you know,

694
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,440
but I decided I wanted to do something

695
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,040
about society collapsing.

696
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Maybe I'm a f**king idiot, but that's what I decided to do,

697
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,720
and that's what I've been doing ever since.

698
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't want society to collapse.

699
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,240
It's funny people ask me this, you know,

700
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,120
I made millions of pounds

701
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,920
betting that the average British family

702
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,320
will collapse into poverty.

703
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,720
Desperate poverty.

704
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,040
I'm talking about Charles f**king Dickens,

705
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,400
Oliver f**king Twist.

706
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,160
That is the future of this country

707
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
if we don't deal with growing inequality.

708
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,800
That is what I see.

709
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,880
It's wealth, I mean, it's wealth inequality.

710
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,800
It's wealth inequality.

711
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,160
Listen, if you allow wealth to flow

712
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,520
at an unbelievably rapid rate out of your middle class,

713
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,400
away from ordinary working families,

714
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,840
away from the government, towards the super-rich,

715
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,360
then living standards will collapse,

716
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,080
housing will become unaffordable.

717
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,480
Distribution matters.

718
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,000
If we're playing chess,

719
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,920
and you take all of my pieces one at a time,

720
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,800
I'm gonna f**king lose that chess game.

721
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,520
That is what I see when I see the economy.

722
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,560
We've seen government debt explode.

723
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,840
We've seen living standards collapse

724
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,440
for ordinary working people.

725
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,920
At the same time, the biggest and fastest ever

726
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,480
increase in the wealth of millionaires and billionaires.

727
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,920
And nobody's connecting these two things.

728
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,280
The reality is,

729
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,800
we've created a world which

730
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,640
tells you you need to be rich to be happy,

731
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,560
you need to be rich to be of value.

732
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,320
And yet, which simultaneously makes it

733
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
almost impossible for them to get rich.

734
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,000
Listen, don't buy it. Don't buy the hype on it.

735
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,080
You know? Yeah, work hard to take care of a family,

736
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,560
and be proud of yourself,

737
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,920
be proud of the things that you achieve,

738
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,360
because they're selling you a dream

739
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
that they never gave you a chance of getting.

740
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,440
And if you buy that dream,

741
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,080
you're gonna be f**king unhappy.

742
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,280
And I've got friends that work really, really hard,

743
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,480
and struggle to pay the bills.

744
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,480
And I want, I want those people to be proud.

745
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,560
'Cause that was my dad, and my mum.

746
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah. We all want to be proud

747
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,720
of the work that we do and realise that,

748
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,040
that this, these stars they're putting

749
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,000
in your eyes are for them, and not you.
