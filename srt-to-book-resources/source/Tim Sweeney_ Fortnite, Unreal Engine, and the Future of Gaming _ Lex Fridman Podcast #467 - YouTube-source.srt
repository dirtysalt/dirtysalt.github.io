1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,570
- Humans are by far the hardest part of computer graphics

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,850
because millions of years of evolution

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,370
have given us dedicated brain systems

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,840
to detect patterns and faces and infer emotions and intent

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,550
because cavemen had to,

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,500
when they see a stranger determine whether they were

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,807
likely friendly or they might be trying to kill them.

8
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,470
And so people in the world have extraordinarily

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,630
detailed expectations of a face

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,520
and we can notice imperfections,

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,870
especially perfect arising

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,120
from computer graphics limitations.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,737
Okay, one part is capturing humans.

14
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:34,770
And so it involved really advanced, dedicated hardware

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,860
that puts a human in a capture sphere

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,070
with dozens of cameras in them, taking high resolution,

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,990
high frame rate video of them as they go

18
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,880
through a range of motions.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,950
And then capturing the human face is complicated

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,597
because the nuance detail of our faces

21
00:00:48,597 --> 00:00:50,670
and how all the muscles and sinews

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,580
and fat work together to give us different expressions.

23
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,740
So it's not only about the shape of a person's face,

24
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,630
but it's also about the entire range of motion

25
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,010
that they might go through.

26
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,360
So that's the data problem.

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,867
There's a lot of other problems with computer graphics.

28
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,950
You know, there's technology for rendering hair,

29
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,170
which is really hard 'cause you can't render every, again,

30
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,220
we know the laws of physics.

31
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,810
It would be easy to just render every hair.

32
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,510
It would just be a billion times too slow.

33
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,970
So you need approximations that capture the net effect

34
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,670
of hair on rendering and on pixels

35
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,520
without calculating every single interaction

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,130
of every light with every strand of hair.

37
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,963
That's one part of it.

38
00:01:23,963 --> 00:01:26,580
There's detailed features for different parts of faces.

39
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,720
There's subsurface scattering

40
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,087
because we think of humans as opaque.

41
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:33,420
But really our skin is, we light travels through it.

42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,770
It's not completely opaque.

43
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,150
And the way in which light travels

44
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,640
through skin has a huge impact on our appearance.

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,860
And this is why there's no way you can paint a mannequin

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,020
to look realistic for a human.

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,040
You know, it's just a solid surface

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,363
and we'll never have the sort of detail you see.

49
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:51,870
- That kind of blew my mind, like thinking through that.

50
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:55,800
I think I heard that sort of the oiliness of the skin

51
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,800
creates very specific, nuanced, complex reflections

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,140
and then some light is absorbed

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,430
and travels through the skin

54
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,669
and that creates textures that are humanized,

55
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,590
able to perceive and it creates the thing

56
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,340
that we consider human, whatever that is.

57
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,210
All of that, while considering all the muscles involved

58
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,590
in making the nuance expression, just the subtle squinting

59
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,830
of the eyes or the subtle formation of a smile,

60
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,040
it's a subtlety of human faces that you have to capture.

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,950
Like the difference between a real smile and a fake smile.

62
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,330
But the way to show like beginning of a formation of a smile

63
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,880
that actually reveals a deep sadness.

64
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,070
All of that, like when I watch a human face,

65
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,463
I can like read that.

66
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,920
I could see that.

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,900
You have to have the tools

68
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,990
that in real time can render something like that.

69
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,910
And that's incredibly difficult.

70
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,520
- That's right, getting faces right requires the interplay

71
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,350
of literally dozens of different systems

72
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,910
and aspects of computer graphics.

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,010
And if any one of them is wrong,

74
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,827
your eye is completely drawn to that

75
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:04,427
and you find it on the wrong side of uncanny valley.

76
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,750
- The following is a conversation with Tim Sweeney,

77
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,640
a legendary video game programmer,

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,040
Founder and CEO of Epic Games

79
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,070
that created many incredible games of technologies,

80
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,610
including the Unreal Engine and "Fortnite,"

81
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,490
which both revolutionized the video game industry

82
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:28,490
and the experience of playing and creating video games.

83
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,350

86
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,253
And now, dear friends, here's Tim Sweeney.

87
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,730
When did you first fall in love with computers

88
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,870
and maybe with programming?

89
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,850
- I had a brother, Steve Sweeney,

90
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,250
who 16 years older than me,

91
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,770
and at some point when I was a little kid,

92
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,590
he went off to work in California for a tech company

93
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,560
and he'd gotten one of the first IBM PCs.

94
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,600
And so for one summer, I think I was about 11,

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,087
I went to visit him in California.

96
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,230
It was my first like trip away from my family

97
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,370
just to hang out with him.

98
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,590
And he had this brand new IBM computer

99
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,050
and I learned to program over the course of a few days

100
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,200
in BASIC, I was just blown away with the capabilities

101
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,600
of computers at the time.

102
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,560
It was unbelievable what they could accomplish.

103
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,589
And I was hooked from that point onward

104
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,140
and very much wanted to be a programmer.

105
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,279
- Do you remember what you wrote in BASIC?

106
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,910
Is it a video game type thing?

107
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,670
Is it like for loop, some numerical thing?

108
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,780
Do you remember?

109
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,360
- Yeah, it's funny, I have a perfectly vivid memory

110
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,200
of all of the first things I learned to program. (laughs)

111
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,640
I have a hard time remembering people's names,

112
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,860
but like code really sticks with me.

113
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,860
Every step and every challenge there were lessons learned

114
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,840
and you know, some of which I've come to realize

115
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,900
were just like me getting over some learning hurdles.

116
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,580
But other things were actually shortcomings

117
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,780
of programming languages

118
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,023
and the realization that there are actually better ways than

119
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:55,830
what a programmer is learning to program for the first time.

120
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,210
You know, a lot of what they're facing

121
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,490
isn't the challenge of learning a new art.

122
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,430
It's friction introduced by failures

123
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,750
of programming language design.

124
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,660
And so I've constantly come back to those early lessons

125
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,390
there as I've progressed and done more

126
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,850
and more things including building programming languages.

127
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,080
- Yeah, the friction and the pain is the guide

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,240
to learning in programming.

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
Like if I were to describe programming journey

130
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,700
that would be marked by pain.

131
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,100
And that pain, you shouldn't escape the pain.

132
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,900
The pain is instructive for you

133
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,220
to understand programming languages.

134
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,290
But do you remember what kind of stuff you were writing

135
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,290
at that time?

136
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,520
Just the early programs?

137
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,570
- Yeah, in the early days

138
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,830
I wrote a little bit of everything.

139
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,300
I wrote some games.

140
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,630
The first game I wrote on the Apple II was...

141
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,390
Since I only knew how to program in text mode,

142
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,120
the computer would throw asterisks across the screen.

143
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,260
They'd flow from left to right

144
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,240
and you'd have a parentheses on the right hand side

145
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,580
of the screen and yeah, looks like a baseball mitt

146
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,440
and you're supposed to catch the asterisks.

147
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,520
That was my very first game.

148
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,920
It took about a couple hours to build

149
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,140
and tune and I went from there.

150
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,980
But I built a lot of things.

151
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,530
I built databases at different points.

152
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,670
I built a programming language

153
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,890
and a full compiler for a language like Pascal

154
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,403
'Cause I didn't know where you went to buy one of those.

155
00:06:11,403 --> 00:06:13,380
So I made my own.

156
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,380
And you know, one of the fun things at that time

157
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,670
was Bulletin Boards.

158
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,970
Before we had the internet in the hands of consumers,

159
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:25,500
you used your modem and you dialed into a local phone number

160
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,630
and connected to whoever was running the computer there.

161
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,980
And every town or city

162
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,270
had hundreds of these Bulletin Boards

163
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,170
run by different people

164
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,420
with their own personalities and teams.

165
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,060
And so I spent a lot of time Bulletin Board program

166
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,380
and learning how to deal

167
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,480
with database management and user interface

168
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,790
and dealing with multiple users concurrently and things.

169
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,134
And so I don't know, I'd probably spend about 10,000

170
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:48,540
or 15,000 hours writing code just on my own as a kid

171
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,130
between like age 10 and you know, age 20

172
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,537
before I actually shipped a program to the outside world.

173
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:59,250
- 10,000 to 15,000 hours.

174
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,740
What was the value of the hours as a kid you put in,

175
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,810
in programming that led

176
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,210
to the success you've had in later life?

177
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,820
Maybe this is by way of advice to younger people

178
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,810
in terms of how they allocate the hours of their early life.

179
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,670
- Yeah, you know, it's not just hours.

180
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,230
It's really striving to learn to understand

181
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,000
what knowledge you have, what knowledge you lack,

182
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
and to continually do experiments

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
and work on projects that improve your knowledge base.

184
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,280
And I didn't do this with a great amount

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,750
of structure or planning.

186
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,730
I was rather just going from project to project,

187
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,920
doing things that I thought would be fun and cool.

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,350
And with each project I learned new things.

189
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,330
You know, learning about how to store and manage data,

190
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,090
learning how to deal with advanced data structures,

191
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,473
how to write complex programs

192
00:07:43,473 --> 00:07:48,000
that have deeply nested data and control flow.

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
Each one of those, you know, provided a lesson

194
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,010
which were later essential, you know,

195
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:56,370
when in 1991 I released my first game

196
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,300
and over the course of that decade we went from,

197
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,620
you know, zero commercial releases

198
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,930
to the first generation Unreal Engine.

199
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,880
But you know, this was largely just using the knowledge

200
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,340
that I'd built up over the previous decade

201
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,560
just doing fun hobby projects.

202
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,150
And if I hadn't done all of that work,

203
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,100
there's no way I could have ever built

204
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,660
the things that came later.

205
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,250
- All the experimentation and all the exploration

206
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,400
somehow contributed, somehow made sense later on.

207
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,660
Like all of that is integrated

208
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,310
somehow in the stuff you build.

209
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,633
It's funny how life works,

210
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,730
the pieces kind of come together eventually.

211
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,610
- Yeah, you know, there are definitely "Karate Kid" moments.

212
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,443
'Cause you know,

213
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,510
all this time I was learning math in high school

214
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,669
and in college I studied mechanical engineering.

215
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,030
And so, you know, you learn all kinds of math,

216
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,240
calculus and vector math and matrices

217
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,270
and you know, all of these related fields,

218
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,750
physics and stress and strain and how to, you know,

219
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,300
deal with complex physical systems.

220
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
And yeah, I wasn't really sure

221
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,640
how engineers would actually make use of that knowledge.

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,680
Do you just like forget about it

223
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,910
when you actually go off to do work?

224
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,830
Or do you write down equations on paper?

225
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,500
It was actually not clear as an early engineering student

226
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,000
what you do.

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,470
But when I started writing the first generation

228
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,330
Unreal Engine and I was dealing with 3D math, I was like,

229
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,355
wait, I know this stuff, I learned this.

230
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:18,633
(Tim and Lex laughing)

231
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:21,120
And you know, suddenly like the "Karate Kid", you know,

232
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,520
you get to paint the fence and wax the car

233
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,683
and suddenly you put all the pieces together into, you know,

234
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:29,040
a 3D engine based on whole lot

235
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,330
of accumulated programming language

236
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,480
and math knowledge that

237
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,310
often knowledge gained without ever anticipating

238
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,020
that I might use it in that way.

239
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,640
- Also, I think what's useful

240
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,860
is over and over learning a hard thing

241
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,040
and then showing to yourself, you know, that you can do it.

242
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:50,610
That you can learn a hard thing.

243
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,000
So then when you come to having to write a 3D engine

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,290
that in ways that haven't been done before,

245
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,300
you're like, I've been here,

246
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,443
I've been here in this experience.

247
00:10:01,443 --> 00:10:04,350
Like I don't know what to do, but we'll figure it out.

248
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,720
We'll learn, I'll learn all the necessary components.

249
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
So just not being afraid of something new.

250
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,990
- That's right, and constantly striving to make connections

251
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,900
between these fields and look for their applications.

252
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,180
Long after I chipped on Unreal Engine,

253
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,920
it was like going back through an engineering textbook

254
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,292
and looking at, oh yeah, I used that,

255
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:22,125
I used that, I use that.

256
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,330
And then I got to the section on eigenvalues,

257
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,267
I'm like, don't know what the hell this is.

258
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,212
But you know, it turns out eigenvectors

259
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,720
and eigenvalue were the critical breakthrough

260
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,480
that made the Google search engine technology work

261
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,710
and stand apart from the rest.

262
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,380
Because they found if you threw all the links

263
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,243
that exist in the web

264
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,920
and you know, links from in two different sites

265
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,270
and you put them in a giant matrix

266
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,050
and you conclude it, you found a dominant eigenvalues,

267
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:49,050
then those eigenvectors described the best search results

268
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,890
for different things.

269
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,040
And so constantly picking up knowledge

270
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,550
and looking for ways to put it together is the thing to do.

271
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,250
And if you aspire to be a programmer,

272
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,570
you've gotta write a lot of code

273
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,820
and you've gotta continually learn new things and improve.

274
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,370
And if you wanna be an artist, you've gotta continually

275
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,650
draw artwork all styles and all kinds

276
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,200
and constantly push yourself to learn more and more

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,450
because you never know exactly

278
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,760
what you're gonna end up doing in the long run.

279
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,680
But the more knowledge you have and the more skills,

280
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,660
the more chance you have putting it together

281
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,100
and being successful.

282
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,810
- And whether you're a programmer or an artist,

283
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,580
you should probably take linear algebra,

284
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,440
even though it doesn't make sense at the time.

285
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,500
- I found getting an engineering degree

286
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,900
and then never working in an engineering field, you know,

287
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,723
just being a computer programmer was immensely valuable.

288
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,200
You know, I went to University of Maryland,

289
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,610
which for some disciplines

290
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,840
it's kind of known as a party school,

291
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,670
but they worked the engineers to death,

292
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,503
worked really hard. (Lex laughing)

293
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:44,520
And if you learn any engineering discipline,

294
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,110
you learn massive amounts of math

295
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,210
and you learn the rigor of problem solving.

296
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,990
You know, not just what you find from the Wikipedia article,

297
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,910
but going through all the exercises

298
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,740
of solving complex problems

299
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,992
and building up series of solutions

300
00:11:57,992 --> 00:11:59,700
to derive in an answer.

301
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,043
It's valuable and it embodies the knowledge

302
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:03,990
that you need as a programmer.

303
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,880
And you know, people often go to university

304
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,620
and think, okay, my goal here is to get good grades,

305
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,880
so I get a diploma and I prove

306
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,050
to an employer they're invaluable.

307
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,700
Like, no, that's just kind

308
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,880
of the superficial bookkeeping of the university.

309
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,120
The real purpose of all of this is to learn.

310
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,360
And whether you learn formally or you learn on your own,

311
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
it's the learnings that are really valuable in a career.

312
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,460
And especially if you're going to be entrepreneur anywhere,

313
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,110
it's really knowing the stuff that matters

314
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,950
and not having the diplomas is into, yeah,

315
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,130
there's ever more pressure to make rebuild society

316
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,405
more and more around credentials.

317
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,970
Do you have this certificate? Do you have that proof?

318
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,503
But like, you know, companies

319
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:43,290
that are focused on just building great products

320
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,410
and doing great things gravitate towards

321
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,150
people who do the great work.

322
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,560
- Yeah, one of the great things about youth

323
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,450
is there's more freedom.

324
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,880
There's just more time to learn.

325
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,080
And people, when they go to high school,

326
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,157
they sometimes think, "Wow, I can't wait to get out of this

327
00:13:01,157 --> 00:13:03,840
and be an adult and be free."

328
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,610
But it's not quite freedom.

329
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,070
When you get a job and you start a family,

330
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,490
all wonderful things, you get more and more busy

331
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:15,510
and less and less time to learn in the general sense,

332
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,160
learn whatever the hell you want.

333
00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:19,650
That is a wonderful time in life.

334
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,440
The teenage years, the early 20s.

335
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,770
The 20s when you could just learn random shit.

336
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:27,480
- Yeah, you know, I think this is something

337
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,030
that's kind of changing in America.

338
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,550
There's so much focus on grades and homework

339
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,530
and structure around kids' lives.

340
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,390
You know, when I was growing up, you know,

341
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,240
my mom would feed me and my neighbor's, you know,

342
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,040
my neighbor's moms would feed them breakfast

343
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,624
and they'd, you know, be like, "Well be back by dark."

344
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,581
(Lex laughing)

345
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:47,430
- And you know, we'd go out and we'd play

346
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,630
and we'd do all sorts of things.

347
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,210
We'd, you know, explore the woods, we'd build go-karts,

348
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:54,000
we'd, you know, salvage old pieces of electronics

349
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
and build you what we thought were

350
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,730
our spacecraft control panels for the, you know,

351
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,350
fake spaceships we were building as play.

352
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,050
And we'd have an enormous amount of freedom.

353
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,330
And you know, from basically being a little kid

354
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,683
through the time I went off to college,

355
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,647
it had an enormous amount of free time.

356
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,200
And some people just used that and waste it, and watched TV.

357
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,450
Some people socialized

358
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,600
and some people really got into serious projects.

359
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,319
So many people at all times were doing cool things.

360
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:26,190
You know, I was programming, I was learning to build things.

361
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:29,160
I was, you know, before I was releasing games to the world,

362
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,130
I'd be like, yeah, having neighborhood folks over

363
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,560
to play the things I was working on and check them out.

364
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,500
And sometimes they're impressed and sometimes they weren't

365
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
and they'd have their own projects

366
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,410
and often we'd have spare time jobs

367
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,000
and everybody was entrepreneurial.

368
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,220
Like everybody, you know, had a side gig.

369
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,350
Sometimes you go around and mow people's lawns

370
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,960
or you'd, you know, rake the leaves up

371
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,970
and, you know, earn money and do...

372
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,960
The freedom there,

373
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,650
and the organic learning that occurred there,

374
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,570
I think is something that is really critical

375
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,860
to the American experience.

376
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,690
I worry is increasingly going away

377
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,170
as society is ever more protective and sheltering

378
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,903
and makes it harder to get these experiences.

379
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,980
- So on the video game side,

380
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,890
when did you first fall in love with video games?

381
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,260
- I've had a funny relationship with games

382
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,820
because my real aspiration has always been

383
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,170
to program cool stuff.

384
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,970
I get more enjoyment of programming

385
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,570
than anything else in the world.

386
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:30,540
And so, you know, my first really two formative experience

387
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,970
with games were playing

388
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,490
this game called "Adventure" for the Atari 2600.

389
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,760
It was like you moved this dot around the screen

390
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,670
and picked up objects like swords and fought dragons

391
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,490
and invaded castles and solved puzzles.

392
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,770
Very, very simple iconic stuff, you know,

393
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,480
rather than realistic graphics.

394
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,310
And then the other game that really got immersed in

395
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,340
was "Zork," which was a text of adventure game.

396
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,953
It would tell you where you are and what you see

397
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,930
and you type in commands like "go north" or "pickup sword"

398
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,900
or "open door" and explore a world that way.

399
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,340
So the game didn't have any graphics,

400
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,130
but in your mind you had this elaborate picture

401
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,180
of what you're seeing there.

402
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,900
And it really brought inspired imagination

403
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,160
more than other things.

404
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,494
And playing those games led me to (indistinct)

405
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:16,521
and where I learn to program everything that I saw there

406
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,760
and that drove a lot of my programming.

407
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,160
I learned how to move a player around the screen.

408
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,220
I learned how to, you know, build a design tool

409
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,990
so I could build castles and save them off

410
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,823
and then play them in a game.

411
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:27,900
And I realized there was a separation between the tools

412
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,030
that you use to build a game and the game itself.

413
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,040
And that if the more powerful tools you had,

414
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,040
the more creativity you could unleash in yourself or others.

415
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,190
And you know, I learned all the programming techniques

416
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,310
that supported games, how to parse text, you know,

417
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,030
pick up sword and go north, how do you make that sentence

418
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,393
into an actual series of commands on the computer?

419
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,110
And that was really, really exciting.

420
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,000
I have to say, until the time that "Fortnite" came out,

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,090
I played video games primarily to learn what they were doing

422
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:58,940
so I could go off and do that myself.

423
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:01,020
You know, I'd sit down, you know,

424
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,670
when "Wolfenstein" tying came out

425
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,160
and then "Doom" came out, you know, I'd go through

426
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,619
and look at pixel by pixel, I'd move the mouse very slightly

427
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,109
and look exactly what was happening to figure out.

428
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:10,943
- That's great.

429
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:12,584
- What technique was being used there

430
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:14,760
and that was a puzzle solving at a grand scale.

431
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,663
And it was so fun.

432
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,800
- So, take me there in the early '90s.

433
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,383
So you launched Epic Games in 1991,

434
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,120
so the writing of your first big video game, "ZZT".

435
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,980
What was it like? What was the technical challenges?

436
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,193
What were the psychological challenges of building that?

437
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,710
- It was a funny project

438
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,740
because I didn't start out to build a video game.

439
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,840
I just moved from an Apple II that,

440
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,090
so my brother bought my family an Apple II

441
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,800
right after I'd visited him in California.

442
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,870
So I've been programming on that for a few years.

443
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,950
Learned a lot of techniques,

444
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,310
but weren't many Apple II users around still

445
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,346
by the time that cycle came to an end.

446
00:17:56,346 --> 00:18:00,525
And so I'd just gotten an IBM PC of my own, I was learning

447
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:02,520
to program and I realized I needed to text editor.

448
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,010
So I started writing a text editor, you know,

449
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,890
a text editor is a program to edit text files.

450
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,510
You have logic to move the cursor around

451
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,910
and let people type things and backspace and delete

452
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,310
and do all of those, you know, mundane actions.

453
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,991
And you know, one night I was like, I finished it up

454
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:18,538
and I was like, well, okay,

455
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:20,220
I have a text editor, but this is pretty boring.

456
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,310
And so I made the cursor into a smiley face character

457
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,980
and I had the like different characters you could place

458
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,560
in this document, perform different gameplay actions.

459
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,810
Some would be walls and some would kill you

460
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,640
and some would be moving objects

461
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,350
that could fly around the screen.

462
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,180
And so this text editor that I made evolved

463
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,260
into little game editors.

464
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,884
So I was building these levels for a game.

465
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,570
I put a lot of time into like building an editor

466
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,640
and a primitive set of objects,

467
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
about 20 or 30 different objects,

468
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,390
enough to build a really cool and compelling game,

469
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,640
but not so many that players would lose track

470
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,750
of what they're seeing.

471
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,450
I started off just building different game levels.

472
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,520
You know, the idea is you'd be on a series of board,

473
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,800
they'd be connected by, you know, going north

474
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,450
passed the end of the current board would take you

475
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,950
to a new one if it was open

476
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,260
or maybe it was block and you couldn't go there.

477
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,850
I built the whole game world around that

478
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,632
and you know, this was the game that became "ZZT."

479
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,817
And I was having fun with it, building it and playing it,

480
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:13,170
but I didn't know if it would really work.

481
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,060
So I did this experiment.

482
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,970
I started inviting neighbors over, like some adults,

483
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,400
some kids of all different ages and sat them down from it

484
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,140
and said like, "Here's a game I made.

485
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,790
Figure it out." (Lex laughing)

486
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,520
And you know, I had to force myself not to tell them

487
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,540
what they need to do, right?

488
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,423
Because I really wanted to learn if they were able to,

489
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,240
you know, discover it all for themselves.

490
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,310
You know, today we would call this, you know,

491
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,230
user experience test

492
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,430
and there's a whole field to research

493
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,050
around user experience research,

494
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,310
but back then it was just inviting

495
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,373
some kids over to play the game.

496
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,670
I took notes about what they got stuck on

497
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,790
and what they enjoyed and where they felt bored

498
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,200
and just iteratively polished the game

499
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,000
until I felt it was good and I put it out

500
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,090
and released it on, well this was before the internet,

501
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,930
so there were Bulletin Boards.

502
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,090
I upload it to a bunch of local Bulletin Boards

503
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,160
and from there it started spreading

504
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,140
because, you know, the way to build up cred

505
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,870
for Bulletin Board users was to upload new files

506
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:04,717
and to claim that,

507
00:20:04,717 --> 00:20:07,146
"Hey, I was the first that brought this to you."

508
00:20:07,146 --> 00:20:08,910
And you know, so there was a natural tendency

509
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,530
of the software to spread.

510
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,240
I decided to use the sharer model, you know,

511
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,160
so I didn't just build this one game.

512
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,863
I built a trilogy of three games.

513
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,470
And I released the first one for free

514
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,800
and I said, "Hey, if you'd like this, buy the two sequels."

515
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,470
And yeah, I included my parents' mailing address

516
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,389
and said, you know, "Send us $30

517
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:29,907
and you can get the sequels to this game."

518
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:33,482
And the checks started coming in within a few days. (laughs)

519
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,910
And I was making like, getting three or four orders a day,

520
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,440
I was making like $100 a day.

521
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,270
I'm like, "Woo, I'm rich." (laughs)

522
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,620
Because, you know, being a 20-year-old,

523
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,050
that was like a pretty big deal.

524
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,340
- What did that feel like, just getting money

525
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,800
and probably feeling this immense success

526
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,720
from something you've created?

527
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,840
- Well, you know, I looked at money always just as a tool

528
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,140
to help you fund accomplishing cool things.

529
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,730
And you know, having enough

530
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,060
to do the things you wanna do is the critical thing.

531
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,980
It's always been just very utilitarian,

532
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,260
but the knowledge that other people all around the country

533
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,180
and all then, you know, and a month later,

534
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,520
all around the world were playing the game

535
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,140
that was mind-boggling.

536
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,660
You know, that me, like this little kid, who'd put out

537
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,580
a game on a local Bulletin Board

538
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,320
could be doing international business

539
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,560
and shipping discs all over the world to players,

540
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,551
you know, because the software was spreading on its own.

541
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:27,120
It was just magical.

542
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,500
And that was a new thing for software.

543
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,690
Like that did not happen with mechanical devices.

544
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,090
Like you manufactured one, you sold it to somebody

545
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,230
and they had it and that was it.

546
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,150
But software could spread.

547
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,170
That was just really cool to see.

548
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,360
And it made me realize there's really no upward limit

549
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,160
on the potential for business like that.

550
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,850
You know, we saw Microsoft as a big juggernaut company

551
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,860
at the time, but it was like, hey, you know,

552
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,240
if that Epic does games good enough, you know,

553
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,160
we could accomplish what they've accomplished

554
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,780
with operating systems.

555
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,160
And the sky was the limit.

556
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,490
And I think this is the age we live in now,

557
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,050
you don't have to be an industrialist

558
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,720
manufacturing physical products.

559
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,240
Anybody who builds anything digitally,

560
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,430
if it's good enough you can reach the entire world

561
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,540
and build the, you know, next Microsoft or Meta or Apple

562
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,463
or Google or Epic Games.

563
00:22:12,406 --> 00:22:13,977
- It's such a cool origin story though.

564
00:22:13,977 --> 00:22:16,620
You start out building a text editor,

565
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,850
so you're looking at this project,

566
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,177
you're playing around with it, you're building up the tools

567
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:25,410
and it's such an inspiring moment

568
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,377
'cause a lot of us start out building a project

569
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:33,377
and to allow yourself to see the potential pivots,

570
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,230
the potential trajectories that can go is really nice.

571
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,170
To sit back, allow yourself to be bored

572
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,000
and like, "Ah, I'm gonna go this way."

573
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,730
I mean, that's like a crossroads.

574
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,530
You came to a crossroads.

575
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,530
I mean, you built, you know, compilers,

576
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,117
you design your own programming language,

577
00:22:51,117 --> 00:22:52,830
you built compilers, databases,

578
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,960
all this things you mentioned.

579
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,350
And you started building a text editor

580
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,210
and then here came to this crossroad,

581
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,163
I'm gonna make this fun.

582
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,010
And then from there, you know,

583
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,410
one of the most legendary gaming companies was created.

584
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,243
It's kind of cool,

585
00:23:08,243 --> 00:23:12,870
like that's an inspiring thing for sort of developers.

586
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,840
Like be open to the possibility of creating something

587
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
you didn't plan to create and just go with it.

588
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,100
Right, that's cool.

589
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,770
- Yeah, and it was a bunch of learnings emerged

590
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,090
really quickly there.

591
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,640
The neat thing I did with "ZZT" was I didn't just release

592
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,430
the game, I also released the editor with it.

593
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,010
I built this tool so I could make these "ZZT" boards

594
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,007
that people could play, but I also gave it

595
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,920
to all of the players themselves.

596
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,007
And you know, like 30 years later I still run into people,

597
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:41,659
you know, when I go to a game industry event, it was like,

598
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:43,530
you know, "I grew up playing 'ZZT.'"

599
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,044
And you know, here's an adult who grew up playing my game.

600
00:23:46,044 --> 00:23:46,950
(Tim laughing)

601
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,450
And it was because it enabled anybody

602
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,530
to become a creator too.

603
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,420
It had, you know, this old board editor

604
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,700
and it also had a little scripting language

605
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,690
so you could learn a little bit of programming in it too.

606
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,750
And it kind of impressed

607
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,300
and it really set a formative principle of Epic,

608
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,280
which was that, you know, the company's mission

609
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,450
is to make awesome entertainment, but also awesome tools

610
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,070
and to share those tools with everybody

611
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,960
so that they can build their own amazing things too.

612
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,790
And when we got into Unreal Engine a few years later,

613
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,500
the interplay between us building a game

614
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,230
and us building tools that were widely used

615
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,395
by others was a critical part of that.

616
00:24:21,395 --> 00:24:22,233
And I think that's the sole reason

617
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,930
that Epic has been massively successful.

618
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,700
And actually the reason that we've survived

619
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,880
all of this time is that by serving both creators

620
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,580
and gamers, we've been able to weather

621
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,440
the ups and downs of the game industry.

622
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,040
It's a brutal place for companies.

623
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,140
We've been able to survive every financial downturn

624
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,690
and sometimes the Engine's been funding the business

625
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,650
because we didn't have a game.

626
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,690
And sometimes the games have been funding the business

627
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,170
and it really set a principle in our culture

628
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,810
that's persevered and is continually

629
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,070
bought to their forefront.

630
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,480
- But on the editor front,

631
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,100
that's such a fascinating philosophy

632
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,100
that you always allow people to create their own worlds.

633
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,180
You have an engine from which you simulate the world

634
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,440
that the game is in.

635
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,637
You have the actual game

636
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:13,410
and you also have the freedom for creators to create

637
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:18,030
various, you know, in "Fortnite" islands of their own.

638
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,460
It's like with everything you ship,

639
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,020
that freedom to create is always there.

640
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,970
That's really interesting.

641
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,040
- Yeah, and it's something we aim to do

642
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,277
more and more fully over time.

643
00:25:27,277 --> 00:25:29,610
You know, in the course of building "Fortnite,"

644
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,930
we've built a lot of other tools,

645
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,320
they're useful for us too

646
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,800
because it's not just a game powered by Unreal Engine,

647
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,710
but it's also, you know, a social ecosystem

648
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,600
where people can make friends and voice chat

649
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,980
and get together and parties.

650
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,380
And we've opened up all of those social features

651
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,820
into Epic Online Services

652
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,650
and we give them away to all developers for free

653
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,443
because we all benefit from growth and that user base.

654
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:52,110
And, you know, our goal is ultimately

655
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,910
to build the company's products

656
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,220
and the same technology that we share with everybody else.

657
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,160
And to hope that foster a bigger and bigger ecosystem

658
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,083
over time where everybody benefits.

659
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,570
- If we could just linger on the '90s, (laughs)

660
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,670
so you said Bulletin Boards, maybe you can explain

661
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:12,300
what that's like and also explain the birth of the internet,

662
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,470
what that was like?

663
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,083
What was the internet like in the '90s?

664
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,150
- So the internet is a funny thing.

665
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,540
It started out as this Defense Department research project

666
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,620
called the ARPANET,

667
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,140
the Advanced Research Project Agency Network.

668
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,323
And it's kind of like this secret thing.

669
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,080
That became more and more open

670
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,030
as they connected universities.

671
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,670
Universities connected to the internet in the,

672
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,677
you know, mid 1980s.

673
00:26:36,677 --> 00:26:39,780
And so if you're at a prestigious institution

674
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,520
with access to computers, you could get on there.

675
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,580
But as a consumer, back then we had these modems, you know,

676
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,040
this thing you plug into your phone line

677
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,480
and it dials up on phone number

678
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,370
and then, you know, it sends wild sound effects

679
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:53,562
over the telephone line

680
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,590
to send digital signals back and forth.

681
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,447
And these were really slow three, you know,

682
00:26:57,447 --> 00:26:59,670
the first modem I had was 300 bauds.

683
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,520
That means 30 characters per second of data.

684
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,620
So you're like sitting there watching a sentence

685
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,450
like slowly emerge character by character

686
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,010
as you're going online.

687
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,240
But you know, that's how we got online

688
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,380
and we talked with each other.

689
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,510
So you dial up to a local Bulletin Board,

690
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,620
it'll be run by a person.

691
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,380
Usually they have a computer or two sitting in their kitchen

692
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,180
or something that's running the Bulletin Board

693
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,770
and they have a small community

694
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,870
of a few hundred users all competing

695
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,240
to connect to that one phone line.

696
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,583
It was often busy and you couldn't get in.

697
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,583
And the more popular Bulletin Boards were hardest to get to.

698
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,748
But you had all kinds of communities develop,

699
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:32,787
you know, and you could see like there was

700
00:27:32,787 --> 00:27:34,110
the programming communities

701
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,430
where people talked about programming.

702
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:39,270
There was the news and events, you know, community.

703
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,310
I lived in the outskirts of Washington DC

704
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,450
so that was like a big thing.

705
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,830
But then there was like the pirate community

706
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,230
where they're sharing pirate at Apple II games

707
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,650
and you know, very different community ethos

708
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,850
and mantras out there.

709
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,540
But all, you know, all really nice and also very small.

710
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,020
These Bulletin Board couldn't grow to the size of Facebook

711
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,670
'cause your phone line couldn't take that many calls.

712
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,710
And, you know, then later in the 1990s,

713
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,290
the internet which had been fostered in these colleges,

714
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,700
that started opening up for the public

715
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,900
and anybody could connect to it.

716
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,300
And suddenly the world took on life of its own.

717
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,440
It became much, much easier to reach global audience faster.

718
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,260
- And you would start shipping games to the internet,

719
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,080
which is a bit of a crazy thing to do

720
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,943
because you're supposed to have like a, you know,

721
00:28:24,943 --> 00:28:26,070
a physical copy,

722
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,380
but to post on the internet is pretty innovative.

723
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,810
Even shareware is pretty innovative.

724
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,760
- Yeah, yeah, it's been a funny transition

725
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,023
for the game business.

726
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:35,490
You know, Epic started out making shareware games

727
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,500
distributed digitally,

728
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,900
but you know, as the first 3D games took off,

729
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,840
like "Wolfenstein" and "Doom" from id Software

730
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,690
and then Unreal from us, took off, you know,

731
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,850
to reach a huge audience of billions of users,

732
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:49,080
we had to go into retail stores.

733
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,390
So we worked with a retail publisher and they made a box

734
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,040
and they put CD ROMs in the box .

735
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,070
And you know, then the world started transitioning

736
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,357
back to digitally, like,

737
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:59,910
and that transition didn't start well, right?

738
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,280
The initial transition of gaming to digital

739
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,773
was all but BitTorrent, all piracy.

740
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,190
And the other horror stories about games that would,

741
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,890
you know, sell like 100,000 copies

742
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,810
but have 2 million users

743
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,433
'cause most people pirated it.

744
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,160
And then, you know, Steam came along

745
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,110
and introduced digital distribution

746
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,790
and made digital distribution of legit games so convenient

747
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,823
that most players moved away from piracy towards that.

748
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:30,840
And you know, their practices followed by others

749
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,930
and the early digital industry took form.

750
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:34,763
- Yeah, it's fascinating.

751
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:38,970
I mean, pirates do lead the way for innovation. (laughs)

752
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,950
The same as the story of Spotify.

753
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,760
You basically, I think most people when they derive value

754
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,170
from things like video games,

755
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,933
want to pay for those video games,

756
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,820
they just want it to be easy.

757
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,943
And so the same thing with music with Spotify.

758
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,930
But maybe just staying on the '90s,

759
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,120
they're gonna be a lot of indie game developers

760
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,550
will listen to us talking today.

761
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,950
Can you go back to that mindset

762
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,750
and try to derive some wisdom

763
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,200
and advice to those folks when you were just

764
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,270
a solo developer, maybe just a small group of people

765
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,830
creating your early games

766
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,510
that eventually became this huge gaming company.

767
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,743
But in the early days,

768
00:30:24,942 --> 00:30:26,100
what were you going through?

769
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,960
What were the ups and downs?

770
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,660
What did it take to sort of stay strong and persevere?

771
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,660
- Well, you know, one of the critical things

772
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,270
that Epic always worked hard to do was

773
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,603
to make something different that nobody else was doing.

774
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:43,860
And to try to satisfy a small audience

775
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,090
rather than competing globally

776
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,470
with the game juggernauts.

777
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,600
You know, back in the 1990s, Epic was new,

778
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,760
but Electronic Arts and Activision

779
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,920
and the other big publishers had been around for a decade.

780
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,470
And they were huge companies.

781
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,260
It had giant retail distribution networks.

782
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,400
You know, if I tried to make a game

783
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,530
and then convinced them to publish it,

784
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,020
I doubt I could have had a chance.

785
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,173
And I doubt even if I made a successful game,

786
00:31:07,173 --> 00:31:09,030
that I would've made much money from it,

787
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,180
though they might have.

788
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,080
And you know, so the really unique angle to Epic

789
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,100
then was shareware.

790
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,150
And that was just the idea

791
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,070
that if we distribute our game differently,

792
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,080
then we can reach a much larger audience

793
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,700
than these bigger competitors

794
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,450
by virtue of this first episode of the game being free.

795
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:25,380
You know, it was kind of the advent of

796
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,630
what later became free to play.

797
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:32,460
And the logic of that is just as true now as it was then.

798
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,470
If the thing is free and anybody can get into it,

799
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,180
then it's kind of spread from friend to friend

800
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,427
as people bring, you know, their real world friends

801
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:41,280
into the games they're playing

802
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,200
and, you know, have the opportunity

803
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,210
to build up a community around that.

804
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,640
You know, so the other lesson there was just minimize

805
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,200
the friction of people getting into your game.

806
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,250
Make it easy to get into and make it fun.

807
00:31:52,673 --> 00:31:54,907
And I think the other, well I was very fortunate,

808
00:31:54,907 --> 00:31:56,340
"ZZT" was a funny game.

809
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,980
It was not like, much like any other game,

810
00:31:58,980 --> 00:31:59,987
it was had much worse graphics

811
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:04,560
'cause it was all just text characters, smiley faces

812
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,140
and, you know, other Greek letters

813
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,120
and things participating in this game simulation.

814
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,250
They were kind of iconic representations of characters

815
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,180
rather than real ones.

816
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,510
And you know, this was decades into the age

817
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,540
of real graphical games with interesting graphics.

818
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,760
And so it wasn't even trying to compete in that area,

819
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,740
but it was able to compete in a different area,

820
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,790
which is that, you know,

821
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,180
it wasn't just the three games I'd made

822
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,300
and shipped as a trilogy that were successful

823
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,560
and drove the success of the product.

824
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,000
It was the fact I released an editor

825
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,190
and there's a whole community around it.

826
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,560
And you see that trend is repeated itself.

827
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,410
Like there was know "ZZT" was one of it.

828
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,731
Before that there was

829
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,170
"Bill Budge's Pinball Construction Set,"

830
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,700
that was a 1980s Apple game

831
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,340
that let users build their own pinball tables.

832
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,300
And since then you've had

833
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,760
some of the world's most successful games follow that path.

834
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,807
Like "Minecraft," you can build your own stuff.

835
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:54,750
"Roblox", now "Fortnite Creative"

836
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,888
and underwriter for "Fortnite."

837
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:59,250
You know, games that become platforms for other people

838
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:02,160
to build stuff was a real opportunity.

839
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,990
You know, I think the big thing to realize

840
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,170
as for indie developers right now is like there's massive,

841
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,750
massive competition in every major genre.

842
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,710
And it's very unlikely unless you just happen

843
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,660
to be the world's best at a particular thing,

844
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,700
that you're gonna release a game

845
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,460
in an existing highly competitive genre and win.

846
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,090
A much better chance of success

847
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,220
is in releasing something that hasn't been done before.

848
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,440
Being really unique and reaching an audience,

849
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,710
even if big or medium size or small, reaching an audience

850
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,720
and becoming really popular with that.

851
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,640
Making some money from it and being able to reinvest

852
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,280
and then expand towards your ultimate dream.

853
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,150
You know, I think the one shot go from idea

854
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,150
to commercial success at massive scale is a lot less likely

855
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,340
than the multi-step process of continually build better

856
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,510
and better stuff over time

857
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,360
until you get into a position of excellence.

858
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,070
- And constantly try to do something

859
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,470
that others aren't doing.

860
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,303
- Yeah, that's right.

861
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,530
'Cause if you look at every market,

862
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,410
there's a few markets where the current leader

863
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,150
came late to the space,

864
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,679
usually because the prior leader failed to horribly.

865
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,600
But most of the time the, you know, the company

866
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,449
that's succeeding and winning in a market is the first

867
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,489
or second entrant there.

868
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,070
They've just continually buoyed their success.

869
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,989
- Great advice and fascinating.

870
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:25,290
But on a human level, was it lonely?

871
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:29,969
Was it scary you sitting there as a developer?

872
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:32,310
- I'd say it was the opposite of lonely

873
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,090
because, you know, the thing that spurred me

874
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,300
to actually release this was seeing kids playing the game

875
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,840
in my neighborhood and having fun.

876
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,730
I mean like, this is really good.

877
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,530
And seeing them enjoying it and laughing

878
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:45,777
and pointing at the screen and, you know, getting together

879
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,340
and just wanting to play more.

880
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,900
- [Lex] That's awesome.

881
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,719
- Yeah, and the human element was always pervasive,

882
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,090
you know, because I did not only receive orders,

883
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,320
but people would actually write letters.

884
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,380
You know, we wrote letters back then in the 1990s.

885
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,970
People would say how much they're enjoying the game

886
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,470
and how their kids were playing the game

887
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,360
and so on and so on.

888
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,310
So, you know, they felt very connected.

889
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,490
And you know, I think a lot of businesses have

890
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,050
to make scary decisions

891
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,060
because you're spending, you know, potentially

892
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,133
all of the money you have to take a shot at something

893
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:16,023
that you're not sure will succeed.

894
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,020
I was very fortunate starting a business like this

895
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,700
because it didn't really need any capital.

896
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,260
The capital is, well,

897
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,180
the several thousand dollars in computers I'd bought

898
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,550
by mowing lawns. (laughs)

899
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,340
And it wasn't much risk if that hadn't succeeded,

900
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,420
I guess I could have figured out

901
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,300
how people get mechanical engineering jobs and pursued that.

902
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,890
But once it took off and once the orders started coming in

903
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,300
and people started writing letters saying

904
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,340
they're enjoying the game, I knew I was gonna go all out

905
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,530
and try to build a company there and succeed.

906
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,773
And that was like gonna be, you know, my big goal.

907
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,280
- So I'm sure people know,

908
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,160
but Epic Games was created in 1991

909
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,160
and went on to transform the gaming industry several times,

910
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,020
one of which is Unreal Engine.

911
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,420
So let's talk through the origin story of that.

912
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,680
You said that when "Wolfenstein" and "Doom" came out,

913
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,790
that changed everything.

914
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,353
So take me to that moment.

915
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:14,010
- Yeah, that was a very interesting time.

916
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,160
Epic had, after my first couple of games

917
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,350
that had recruited developers, you know,

918
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,990
usually college students, high school students

919
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,120
who are just working on their own, had real skills

920
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,520
but didn't have an outlet for their work.

921
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,380
Epic had been matchmaking the best artists

922
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,360
and programmers together from all over the world.

923
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,730
Like "Jazz Jackrabbit" was Cliff Bleszinski,

924
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,530
a high school kid in California,

925
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,480
who had made a really cool adventure game

926
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,860
together with Arjan Brussee,

927
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,270
a demo coder from Holland

928
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,370
who would make amazing graphical stuff

929
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,027
and had built a 2D game engine and connected them together

930
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:47,370
and a musician Robert Allen in California.

931
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,370
And they, you know, by telephone and modem and so on,

932
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,230
we were building these little 2D games

933
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,390
and having quite a lot of success.

934
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,470
You know, there were a bunch of people making

935
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,920
thousands of dollars a month while they were still students

936
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,150
and royalties from the games.

937
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,250
The Epic was kind of producing

938
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,883
and by coordinating people and publishing through shareware.

939
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,660
And that was all going great.

940
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,860
The company had a little office

941
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,350
and we were, you know, copying floppy disks

942
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,183
and mailing them out.

943
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:17,610
But when "Wolfenstein" came out, we realized like

944
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,533
the future of gaming is gonna be 3D.

945
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,940
There had been a lot of experiments in 3D before

946
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,740
that hadn't been great.

947
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,590
You know, there were 3D renderings of mazes

948
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,760
that were not in real time

949
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,820
and you're always looking north, south, east or west.

950
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,260
And then there were vector graphics

951
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,720
with little wire frames moving around and things.

952
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,183
But you know, "Wolfenstein" was the first game

953
00:37:39,183 --> 00:37:41,370
that was fast enough, you know,

954
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,780
running at 30 frames per second.

955
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,770
It really felt immersive.

956
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:44,730
It felt like you were there,

957
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,900
like you were, you know,

958
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,330
in this castle Wolfenstein fighting Nazis.

959
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,870
And that was a really amazing and immersive experience.

960
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,520
3D graphics were pretty primitive then,

961
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,610
id Software followed shockingly fast with "Doom",

962
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,923
which was much, much more capable 3D engine,

963
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:01,590
which had, you know, stairs

964
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:04,193
and though it was still what we saw,

965
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:05,880
2.5D it was environments

966
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,970
that were very realistic textures that were very realistic.

967
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,950
You know, a form of lighting that was approximate

968
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,420
but incredibly realistic

969
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,390
and just such great artistry and sound effects.

970
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,353
It feeled completely visceral and real.

971
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:23,401
You know, you might look at it today from a,

972
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,950
you know, point of view of a modern, you know,

973
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,670
game player with, you know, 20 teraflops of computing power

974
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,503
in your device

975
00:38:30,503 --> 00:38:31,800
and say, "Oh, that's not very impressive."

976
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,330
But it was amazing at the time.

977
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,510
- I mean, for me, just sorry to pause on that.

978
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,390
I think "Wolfenstein" was one of

979
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:43,320
the most amazing moments of my own life.

980
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,000
Just being able to, like you said,

981
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,880
in real time move about a three-dimensional world.

982
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,580
I just remember just moving around

983
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:56,163
just in like, what is that feeling like?

984
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,350
I mean, you feel transported into another world.

985
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,880
- You feel that you're there, yeah.

986
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,220
And especially when you turn the lights down in your room

987
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,960
and you turn the sound up on your speakers

988
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,170
and it'll scare you. (laughs)

989
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,090
and you'll feel like, you know,

990
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:15,210
that fireball that's coming at you is gonna kill you.

991
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,187
That was an amazing time

992
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,060
'cause we hadn't experienced that before.

993
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,460
There was nothing like that.

994
00:39:21,432 --> 00:39:22,320
You know, you'd watch a movie,

995
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,940
a scary movie or whatever, you know,

996
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,490
it was just this thing that was happening.

997
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,773
This was you, this was you in a 3D world.

998
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,760
- So how did that change Epic,

999
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,410
this realization that the future of gaming

1000
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,850
is going to be 3D?

1001
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,211
- Well, at first I was really depressed, I think

1002
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:39,044
(Lex laughing)

1003
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:43,350
because the wizardry of "Doom" especially was so incredible

1004
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,008
that I gave up on programming for like six months.

1005
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,220
I was like, "I won't be able to compete with this.

1006
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,840
I have no idea what we're gonna do."

1007
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,520
We just keep making 2D games

1008
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,840
and hope that the business goes on.

1009
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,380
But like, that was the nature of Carmack's wizardry.

1010
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,750
He had done things that were like,

1011
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,760
not just one innovation leap ahead,

1012
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,860
but like a dozen simultaneously,

1013
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,870
interplaying in a way that you couldn't pick them apart

1014
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,130
into their component pieces.

1015
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,170
But funny thing happened,

1016
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,230
Michael Abrash, long timer in computer graphics

1017
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:14,550
that wrote a book on the techniques

1018
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,520
for 3D graphics and texture mapping.

1019
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,870
And he wrote some articles

1020
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,790
in one of the programming magazines of the day

1021
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,460
and explained it and showed assembly code

1022
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,140
to do texture mapping, you know,

1023
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,885
drawing these 3D graphics on the screen.

1024
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:27,718
And it was actually really simple stuff.

1025
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:31,320
I was like, "Oh, I can do that." (laughs)

1026
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,930
And you know, so a bunch of us Epic independently went off

1027
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,300
and started writing our own 3D graphics code

1028
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,170
to figure it out.

1029
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:40,740
And we found at one point we had a number of people

1030
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,867
dabbling in this, doing different parts of it.

1031
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:46,527
And at that point we decide, okay, this is 3D graphics

1032
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,720
and 3D gaming is gonna completely change the world.

1033
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,617
We need to go all in on this.

1034
00:40:49,617 --> 00:40:50,940
And so we took the best people

1035
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,680
from our best 2D game development teams

1036
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,203
and put them all together to make a 3D game.

1037
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,510
We didn't really know what we were doing at the time.

1038
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,980
None of us had ever shipped a 3D game

1039
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,390
and most of us were still learning,

1040
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,330
but everybody was like trying different disciplines

1041
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,500
to see what they were best at.

1042
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:08,070
And it was a combination of a bunch of people

1043
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,450
who came together to make Unreal.

1044
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,840
I'd initially volunteered to make the 3D editor

1045
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,280
for the thing, and James Schmaltz

1046
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,337
who had made "Epic Pinball."

1047
00:41:15,337 --> 00:41:17,220
"Epic Pinball," now that wasn't a crazy game.

1048
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,470
This was one of the 2D shareware games.

1049
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:20,820
He made it while he was in college

1050
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,960
and he was making like $30,000 a month from, you know,

1051
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,070
the royalties from this game

1052
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,940
because everybody had wanted an awesome pinball game,

1053
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,840
it was massively successful.

1054
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,680
But he was a multidisciplinary person.

1055
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,870
He wrote the code for the game, the art for the game,

1056
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,220
and did basically everything.

1057
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,971
And the code was 30,000 lines of assembly language.

1058
00:41:40,971 --> 00:41:42,767
(Tim and Lex laughing)

1059
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,217
And so he was initially gonna write the 3D engine

1060
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,943
and I was gonna write the editor

1061
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:49,110
and he sent me his code

1062
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,430
so I could integrate into the editor.

1063
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,070
It was like just a giant pile of assembly code.

1064
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,740
I was like, "Hmm, why don't I just write this myself?"

1065
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,540
And so James instead started going off

1066
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,590
and building 3D models

1067
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,750
and 3D animations using the tools at the time.

1068
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,080
And so Cliff, who had done a lot of design work

1069
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,970
and built the level on "Jazz Jackrabbit" went off

1070
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,040
and started learning basics of level design.

1071
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,270
And so I was writing this editor

1072
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,660
and Cliff Lesinski was customer number one for it,

1073
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,830
starting to go off and build levels.

1074
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:16,200
And James Schmaltz was drawing awesome creatures,

1075
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,033
sending them to me.

1076
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,590
I get them implemented in game.

1077
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,460
And then we brought an animator to bring them into life

1078
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,840
and we brought in, you know,

1079
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,800
more and more people until

1080
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,930
at the peak of Unreal 1 development

1081
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:27,420
we had about 20 people working on,

1082
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,767
which was a huge team for the time

1083
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:31,230
and was really stretching Epic finances

1084
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,680
nearly to the breaking point.

1085
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,800
We barely survived

1086
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,870
and almost ran out of money a number of times,

1087
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:38,760
but somehow we always pulled through.

1088
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,530
And it was a crazy project

1089
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:42,786
because it was three and a half years of development

1090
00:42:42,786 --> 00:42:44,760
in a game that we always thought was six months

1091
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,550
from shipping. (Tim and Lex laughing)

1092
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,730
You know, it was like a, you know, three and a half years

1093
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,010
of 70 or 80 hour weeks for most everybody

1094
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:54,213
working on the project,

1095
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,870
not even knowing what problems we'd need to solve next

1096
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,360
because we were so immersed in the current ones.

1097
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,310
- Were there moments when you were losing hope

1098
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,860
that this might take too long

1099
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,710
and the company will run outta money?

1100
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,710
- We were always very financially stressed,

1101
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:12,780
so I was continually worried about that.

1102
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,920
I had total confidence

1103
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,470
that we'd work out all the technical and artistic problems

1104
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,960
'cause yeah, we knew the pieces

1105
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:22,020
and it was largely a matter of typing code in

1106
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,420
and solving some problems.

1107
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,700
And kind of like we knew we could ship a version of it.

1108
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,600
And the thing that was continually

1109
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,680
really interesting was the ongoing discovery of

1110
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,970
new techniques as we went.

1111
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,460
You know, 'cause at the time "Quake" had shipped,

1112
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,920
it had a little bit of dynamic lighting.

1113
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,140
Unreal really pushed dynamic lighting much higher

1114
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,600
than anybody else had done before.

1115
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,910
Even colored dynamic lights

1116
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,740
with some shadow casting capabilities,

1117
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,770
statically or moving lights without shadows.

1118
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:55,950
And figured out how to do volumetric fog

1119
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,377
so you could have foggy areas that were full of lights

1120
00:43:58,377 --> 00:44:00,420
and you get the kind of glow of the lights

1121
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,710
standing out in the fog

1122
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,200
and affecting the appearance of the level.

1123
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,123
A whole lot of amazing techniques came together to build

1124
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:09,060
a game that, you know, made a number of leaps

1125
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,160
ahead of the state of the art at the time.

1126
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:15,510
Yeah, it was really crazy,

1127
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:18,420
but like, I think most companies

1128
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,590
wouldn't have survived that,

1129
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,950
but the sheer talent of the people involved

1130
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:23,973
made it possible.

1131
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,860
Epic has often done things that

1132
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:29,850
most companies would've failed at and we succeed.

1133
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:32,670
Like, not because of awesome management or awesome planning

1134
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,100
or awesome financing, but because of the sheer talent

1135
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,370
and willpower of the people involved to make it happen.

1136
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,430
- What about the interdisciplinary aspect of it?

1137
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,930
Like you said, sort of artists, engineers

1138
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,156
or programmers, designers, all of them working together.

1139
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:52,470
What was that the 20 people,

1140
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,710
What was the dynamic there, like working insane hours?

1141
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,950
Like what was it like to sort of make a team like that

1142
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,038
work together well as an orchestra

1143
00:45:02,038 --> 00:45:03,488
to actually deliver the game?

1144
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,510
- Yeah, that's one of the really unique things

1145
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,010
to exist in gaming.

1146
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:12,000
Not in normal big tech companies, which are just engineering

1147
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,170
and business driven,

1148
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,550
but gaming really does require all the best people

1149
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,200
across all the creative disciplines working together.

1150
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,970
And, you know, Epic had grown organically

1151
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,020
by recruiting people with awesome talent.

1152
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:30,120
We always had a limited budget we could never pay to hire,

1153
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,190
you know, bid up people's salaries

1154
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,690
and hire them away by paying them more.

1155
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,970
We just had to find awesome people who were

1156
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,950
at the beginning of their career and put them together.

1157
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,960
And, you know, so everybody was very new to this

1158
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,910
and didn't have any assumptions about how companies worked.

1159
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,250
And so, you know, you put all these people together

1160
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:51,480
and, you know, it was really a constant interplay of talent

1161
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,510
as people were learning how to work together as a team.

1162
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,250
Nobody had management experience.

1163
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,870
Most people hadn't chipped at a game

1164
00:45:57,870 --> 00:45:59,433
before they worked with Epic.

1165
00:46:00,612 --> 00:46:02,880
And we were figuring out as we went,

1166
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,410
but it was a constant iterative cycle.

1167
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:06,120
You know, we'd make several new versions

1168
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,650
of the game every day.

1169
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,780
Be a new compile, introduce a new feature

1170
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,820
or fix some bugs, get to the artist,

1171
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,480
artist improve their levels, continue building stuff,

1172
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,920
and then we see what they're doing in their levels.

1173
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,720
Like, ah, I see what you need now.

1174
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,370
We'd constantly be improving the tools

1175
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,050
and just the iterative process

1176
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,450
and the speed at which that improves products

1177
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,090
is the critical element to success in games.

1178
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,860
The slower the iteration cycle,

1179
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,720
if you make a build every week

1180
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,970
and you go through one iteration every week,

1181
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,100
you're gonna be way, way, way worse by the end

1182
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,570
of your project than a game company

1183
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,673
that makes, you know, new stuff every day.

1184
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,480
And that was the magic that happened together.

1185
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,510
And there was really nothing but passion

1186
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,043
and everybody's individual dedication to it

1187
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:48,213
that made it work.

1188
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,580
- I heard you still program,

1189
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:53,310
but how much programming were you doing back then?

1190
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,340
You mentioned the hours, probably insane hours.

1191
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,973
So like, it'd be almost fun to talk about your setup set up.

1192
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,620
What a day in the life of Tim Sweeney in the '90s

1193
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:06,693
when you were building Unreal look like?

1194
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,150
- Well, we'd all gravitated towards

1195
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,650
a work schedule that maximized productivity

1196
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,010
and that usually meant waking up late.

1197
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,860
I get to like, usually get to work around noon

1198
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,780
and usually work till like 2:00 AM or so 3:00 AM sometimes.

1199
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:27,170
And, you know, I didn't have anything else going on

1200
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,003
in my life,

1201
00:47:28,003 --> 00:47:30,410
so usually just work and sleep and occasional eating

1202
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,520
and yeah, I found I always needed eight or nine hours

1203
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,480
of sleep a night.

1204
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,850
Without good sleep, I would just become a zombie

1205
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,050
and wouldn't be nearly at my best.

1206
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:41,250
So I always needed to get sleep,

1207
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,810
but I didn't need anything else going on.

1208
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,323
So the programming itself was so energizing and drawing.

1209
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,950
Yeah, so it was a, you know, three and a half years of that

1210
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,870
during the project.

1211
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:55,800
Mostly spent programming, I'd say probably 60 hours a week

1212
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,020
of programming, five hours a week of coordinating

1213
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,910
with other people and iterating

1214
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,470
and you know, sitting down with them

1215
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:02,970
and looking at what's going on and screen

1216
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:04,800
and figuring out what they needed.

1217
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,680
Maybe five hours of business stuff, you know,

1218
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,173
there's a good division of labor then.

1219
00:48:11,165 --> 00:48:12,300
I didn't have a big executive team,

1220
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,480
but it was like basically myself running the technical

1221
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,980
and development part of the company

1222
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,680
and Mark Rein running the business part of it,

1223
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,160
doing deals and, you know, maxing out his credit card

1224
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,810
and going around the world

1225
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,630
bringing in sources of revenue to keep the company funded.

1226
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:29,820
- What programming language, are we talking about C?

1227
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,333
Because you mentioned there's this pile of assembly,

1228
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,800
what was your decision in choosing

1229
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,000
the programming language

1230
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,570
that Unreal Engine would be written in?

1231
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,667
- I'd grown up learning with Pascal as my favorite language.

1232
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,800
In order to just get maximum performance

1233
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,840
and get the latest operating system features

1234
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:52,860
I had to move to C for my second game, "Joel of the Jungle,"

1235
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,540
well, Nintendo style platformer.

1236
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,630
And so when I started Unreal Engine, it was

1237
00:48:56,630 --> 00:49:00,818
on 16 bit Windows using the C programming language.

1238
00:49:00,818 --> 00:49:03,240
And over the course of the first year

1239
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,419
it moved to 30 terabit one,

1240
00:49:05,419 --> 00:49:08,700
you know, 30 terabit, you know, using these Doss extenders

1241
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,530
and then using Windows NT.

1242
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,360
And I moved to the C++ language

1243
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,483
and just because it simplified the code so much.

1244
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,290
Went from a really complicated pile of code

1245
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,800
to a much simpler one making that transition.

1246
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,500
And so almost the entirety of Unreal Engine development,

1247
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,530
about two and a half years of it was all on C++ 30 terabit,

1248
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,720
completely stay of the art then,

1249
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,430
like 30 terabit protected mode

1250
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:35,190
was kind of a magical thing having come from the days

1251
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,840
when computers were much less reliable

1252
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,250
and crashed all the time.

1253
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,750
- Yeah, and turned out to be a pretty good bet

1254
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,750
'cause C++ out of all those languages

1255
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:46,320
ended up being the dominant sort of

1256
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,013
performance oriented language that survives to this day.

1257
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,190
- Yeah, yeah, it's because it solves

1258
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,790
all the problems at scale,

1259
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,820
often through manual pain, but always solves them.

1260
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,490
And yeah, a lot of other languages do better

1261
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,230
and a lot of like theoretical aspects

1262
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,790
and are better for some usage cases,

1263
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,410
but you can't do everything

1264
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,500
and that's really very limiting.

1265
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,800
- All right, so ridiculous questions,

1266
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,360
but like, did you have one monitor, two monitors?

1267
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,030
Were you picky on the keyboard?

1268
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:22,650
Were you picky on the chair?

1269
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:24,120
What are we talking about?

1270
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,980
Let's paint a picture.

1271
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,420
- Okay, I went through a big transition there.

1272
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:29,460
So I started out being pretty lazy.

1273
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,980
I'd had a bunch of, like, I bought used computers

1274
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,870
'cause you'd often get them at half the price of a new one.

1275
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:34,860
They'd be good enough.

1276
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:38,730
So I had this old 46 I was developing on,

1277
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:41,910
I guess it was a 15 inch monitor at the time it was all,

1278
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,380
it was a poor workstation set up,

1279
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,660
but it was very economical.

1280
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,020
And so as we started on Unreal, I realized that

1281
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,610
like I had to write a ton of code.

1282
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,620
I had to write absolute maximum productivity.

1283
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,420
So I had to rearrange my entire life

1284
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,720
around delivering maximum output.

1285
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,060
And so at that point I realized like actually spending money

1286
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,370
on getting good equipment was a good investment.

1287
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:04,680
And we're not talking about millions of dollars here,

1288
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,450
or billions if you're building a GPU farm.

1289
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,090
We're just talking about buying some basic hardware.

1290
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,700
And so I bought the biggest CRT you could buy at the time.

1291
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,400
'Cause this was a CRT or it was 24 inches,

1292
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,460
it weighed like a hundred pounds. (laughs)

1293
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,271
I had back pain for a week after I installed it,

1294
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:24,720
but it got me 1920 by 1200 view

1295
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,480
- Wow, nice state of the art.

1296
00:51:28,406 --> 00:51:29,970
- In 1996, that was pretty cool.

1297
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:32,340
So I'd upgraded to a 90 megahertz Pentium (indistinct)

1298
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,600
programming on that.

1299
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,010
It was on the 90 megahertz,

1300
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,867
these were the main consumer computers at the time.

1301
00:51:36,867 --> 00:51:39,750
And I'd optimized the Unreal Engine software render on that,

1302
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,540
which was, you know, the Pentium was

1303
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:46,650
the first super scaler architecture in consumer computing.

1304
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,650
It could run up to two instructions at a time.

1305
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:52,320
And if you wrote your assembly code very carefully,

1306
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,960
you could get absolute maximum throughput.

1307
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,960
You know, so I'd gotten my texture mapping code down

1308
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,743
to six CPU cycles, comprising 11 instructions.

1309
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,350
And, you know, that was required

1310
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,745
for every pixel on the screen.

1311
00:52:05,745 --> 00:52:08,610
And that was just enough performance to deliver that.

1312
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,630
But Dell came out with these new workstations

1313
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,550
and Intel I just launched the Pentium Pro,

1314
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,233
the first out-of-order processor.

1315
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,520
And so I like basically bought the absolute maximum

1316
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,900
configuration that money can buy.

1317
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,533
It costs $7,000.

1318
00:52:23,533 --> 00:52:26,560
I had a gigabyte of memory in 1996

1319
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:29,580
and a 200 megahertz CPU. - [Lex] Wow.

1320
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,380
- So it like tripled the speed of compiles

1321
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:33,360
and just made me massively more productive.

1322
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,230
So that's what I was using

1323
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,890
throughout Unreal Engine development and chipped with that.

1324
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,020
- By the way, people in the '90s would've been blown away

1325
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,150
by this workstation. (Lex laughing)

1326
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,760
I love it, yeah, yeah.

1327
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,610
In writing, were you considering the hardware much?

1328
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,797
Was there a sense like, so you know, for people

1329
00:52:49,797 --> 00:52:51,990
who don't know on Unreal Engine rendering,

1330
00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:55,170
I guess is all software doesn't use the hardware,

1331
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:57,240
but were you trying to optimize, as I understand,

1332
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,760
maybe you can correct me, but like were you trying

1333
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,370
to optimize to the hardware at all?

1334
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,900
- Well, at the time,

1335
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,630
so we did most Unreal Engine development

1336
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:08,883
before the first real GPUs came out.

1337
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,930
And, you know, the 3D effects Voodoo 1.

1338
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,600
The first GPU actually delivered serious performance

1339
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,340
compared to software rendering.

1340
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,640
The first GPU that was really gainful came

1341
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,860
into the development and we supported it really quickly,

1342
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,255
but it was not the target all along.

1343
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:28,150
And so development was focused on just building,

1344
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,040
there are two parts of the engine, right?

1345
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,650
There's all of the gameplay systems

1346
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:34,020
that manage the simulation and physics and so on.

1347
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,490
That's all written in very high level C++ code

1348
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,073
and maintainability is as much of a goal as performance.

1349
00:53:42,111 --> 00:53:43,800
You know, because we had to build massive amounts

1350
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,110
of systems over time.

1351
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,930
But one thing that was really bottleneck was graphics.

1352
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:51,780
You know, the cost of rendering a single pixel

1353
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,613
was really high.

1354
00:53:52,613 --> 00:53:54,510
And so you had to do everything you possibly could

1355
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,480
to optimize the rendering of pixels on screen.

1356
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,420
And you know, so we were talking about how many CPU cycles,

1357
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,210
you know, and you say your CPU runs at a gigahertz

1358
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,845
or whatever, it's a, you know,

1359
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:07,560
a billion instructions per second.

1360
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,150
How many instructions do you need to run

1361
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,797
to get APIX on screen?

1362
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:15,000
And so there was a constant challenge to optimize that down.

1363
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,220
And you know, there was also competition

1364
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,600
among all of the graphics programmers

1365
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,680
who often send the emails,

1366
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,240
you know, like bragging to each other about

1367
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,610
what new technique they've discovered, you know,

1368
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,810
to try to get the cost down.

1369
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:28,230
And Abrash's original articles took like 12 CPU cycles

1370
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,120
to render a pixel and you know,

1371
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,010
everybody else had figured out how to get it to like

1372
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,413
down to six or sometimes even four cycles.

1373
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,260
And, you know, that involved lots of different trade-offs

1374
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,347
of caching and memory hierarchy and so on.

1375
00:54:39,347 --> 00:54:40,980
It was just like a magical time

1376
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,200
where a human could actually understand exactly

1377
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,690
what the CPU was doing under the hood

1378
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,123
and could write code that exactly targeted that.

1379
00:54:49,705 --> 00:54:50,700
And that's largely lost now.

1380
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,740
When we talk about optimization and software now,

1381
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,320
it's largely about heuristics

1382
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,450
and statistically your, you know,

1383
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,770
this memory access is likely to hit the cache

1384
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,810
and you know, this algorithm is faster than that algorithm

1385
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,930
because CPUs now have such advanced out-of-order execution

1386
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,730
that you really can't micromanage what's happening

1387
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,280
on an instruction by instruction basis,

1388
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,277
you can only manage the aggregate performance of code.

1389
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,800
And so there's kind of this lost art.

1390
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,960
Some people miss it, some people don't,

1391
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,750
in which the programmer had absolute control

1392
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,460
over the machine and could work miracles

1393
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,300
in special cases if you tried.

1394
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,100
- It seems like there's still value to that art

1395
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,780
when it comes to GPUs and ASICs.

1396
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,270
So basically trying to understand

1397
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,160
the nuances of the hardware

1398
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,960
and how to truly, truly optimize it,

1399
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,850
whether it's for machine learning applications

1400
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,770
or for ultra realistic real-time graphics applications.

1401
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,840
Is that true?

1402
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,733
- Yeah, that's absolutely so.

1403
00:55:52,092 --> 00:55:55,380
You know, the optimization problems have just moved around.

1404
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,520
In a system like Nanite,

1405
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,570
the virtualized micro polygon geometry system

1406
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,233
that Brian Karis, a brilliant engineer with Epic built,

1407
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:10,160
was just one of those multi-year optimization efforts that,

1408
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:13,170
you know, required him understanding everything

1409
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,390
from the highest levels to the lowest levels of the hardware

1410
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,950
to figure out how to,

1411
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,380
you know, make this breakthrough technique work in a way

1412
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:23,114
that was actually maximally performant on GPUs.

1413
00:56:23,114 --> 00:56:26,250
- And so Nanite is the system will jump around in time

1414
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,193
that takes us to today with Unreal Engine 5.

1415
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:32,430
It's the system that does the geometry?

1416
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,263
- [Tim] Yeah. - So rendering

1417
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:35,700
the world sort of geometric, there's many layers to this.

1418
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:39,540
We'll probably sneak up to each of those,

1419
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,450
but one, you have to actually create the geometry

1420
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:42,525
of the world around you

1421
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:44,880
and do that in real time and really efficiently.

1422
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,920
And there's a bunch of different ways

1423
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,210
to optimize that.

1424
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,440
Can you just speak to it?

1425
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,770
- Yeah, you know, with the advanced art tools we have today,

1426
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:54,120
it's really easy to create a scene

1427
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,920
with billions of polygons.

1428
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,290
The hard part is how to render it efficiently

1429
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,080
because you can't render billions of polygons in a frame.

1430
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,670
Basically you wanna render an image

1431
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,940
that's indistinguishable from the full detailed geometry

1432
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,790
if you rendered it at ridiculous cost.

1433
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:12,810
And so the challenge is how to simplify every component

1434
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,327
of the rendering, you know, the geometry, the lighting

1435
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:17,430
and so on down to real-time techniques.

1436
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,610
They're efficient, they capture a realistic view

1437
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,960
of what's around you.

1438
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,700
And so when an object is up close to you,

1439
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,950
you want to render it with a lot more polygons

1440
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,360
than when it's far away.

1441
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,580
But one of the cool principles of f max

1442
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,460
is the Nyquist sampling theorem that says

1443
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:35,490
if you're trying to reconstruct a signal, there's a limit

1444
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:39,060
to the amount of data you need to bother capturing.

1445
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,310
If you wanna render a texture at a certain resolution,

1446
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,740
then you never need more than twice the pixels

1447
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:46,383
than in the texture that you have on the screen.

1448
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,170
And that, you know, that's called the Nyquist limit.

1449
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,630
And so one of the challenges of computer graphics

1450
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,280
is given the need to render objects

1451
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,700
at extreme closeup distances and extreme faraway distances,

1452
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,533
you always want to be able

1453
00:57:57,533 --> 00:57:59,460
to generate the right amount of geometry

1454
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,860
so that you have enough to be indistinguishable

1455
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:04,203
from reality, but not any more than necessary.

1456
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:08,210
And you know, with geometry, the idea is that

1457
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:12,090
if you render two triangles per pixel, you should get

1458
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,920
an image that is indistinguishable

1459
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,310
from thousands of triangles per pixel.

1460
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:19,170
If you render less than two triangles per pixel,

1461
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,470
you're going to start to see visible artifacts of the loss.

1462
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,780
And GPUs have this amazing hardware

1463
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:25,980
in a lot of different pipelines,

1464
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,180
but it's all very fixed function.

1465
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,470
There's pixel shader hardware,

1466
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,990
there's geometry processing hardware,

1467
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,660
and then there's triangle rasterization hardware.

1468
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,493
And one of the limits of GPUs

1469
00:58:34,493 --> 00:58:36,120
is that the triangle rasterizers

1470
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,010
are built for pretty large triangles.

1471
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,180
If you're building a triangle

1472
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:40,950
or rendering a triangle with 10 pixels,

1473
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,790
that's pretty efficient.

1474
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,440
But if you're building or rendering a triangle

1475
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,960
with one pixel, it's very inefficient.

1476
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,910
So one of the breakthroughs Brian made was

1477
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,800
to design an entire pipeline

1478
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,940
for avoiding the rasterization hardware in the GPU

1479
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,470
and just going straight to pixels

1480
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,560
and calculating what should be done with that pixel

1481
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,660
as a result of some ray tracing

1482
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:04,710
and geometry intersection calculations

1483
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,240
done in a pixel shader.

1484
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,100
So instead of using the triangle pipeline,

1485
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,540
we're just using pixel pipeline

1486
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,980
and... - Wow.

1487
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,600
- [Tim] Getting a better result.

1488
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,830
- Because of the limitations

1489
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:17,670
of the triangle rasterizer in the GPUs, that's fascinating.

1490
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,410
Because as you described, you need tiny triangles

1491
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:24,750
for the detail, for the stuff that's up close.

1492
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,270
I mean, this might seem obvious to people,

1493
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:29,850
but it's not just stuff up close.

1494
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:33,030
It's like, depends where you're looking,

1495
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:34,950
like the human eye and the human focus

1496
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,640
and the human attention mechanism

1497
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,300
defines how much detail you wanna show

1498
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,770
because the thing that the human is likely to be

1499
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,120
giving attention to, you want that

1500
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,680
to be super high resolution.

1501
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,800
And everything else, including due to distance,

1502
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,650
can have less geometry and less texture,

1503
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:56,880
less information in it.

1504
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,170
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1505
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,610
But there's a lot of challenges like that.

1506
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,710
It turns out it's a lot easier to render one frame

1507
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,680
that looks perfect than it is to render a, you know,

1508
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,560
a series of frames in motion that look perfect.

1509
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:10,290
A lot of the problems with the earlier algorithms

1510
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:13,410
that aspired to do the sort of things was popping.

1511
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,630
You know, you'd be running some number of triangles

1512
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,650
for a while and then you'd switch

1513
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,910
to a different number of triangles

1514
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:19,350
and you'd see a visible transition

1515
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:22,173
and screen would look like it got shaken up.

1516
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:24,210
You know, it's a disturbing artifact

1517
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:25,995
that distracts you from the game.

1518
01:00:25,995 --> 01:00:28,320
And so one of the magical trade-offs of Nanite was how

1519
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,940
to avoid all of the visible transitions

1520
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:33,450
and get them down to a point

1521
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,240
where though they exist statistically,

1522
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,560
they're not really perceptible

1523
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,880
to a person looking at it.

1524
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,950
- You look at something like Nanite, I mean,

1525
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,120
there's a nice blog post,

1526
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,770
there's nice descriptions about the details,

1527
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,050
but you can tell even under the details,

1528
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,883
there's just incredible engineering that goes on.

1529
01:00:47,883 --> 01:00:49,200
It's so cool.

1530
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,263
It's so cool how underneath this,

1531
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,860
you know, the actual experience

1532
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,350
of beautiful detailed scenery,

1533
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,940
there's just incredible engineering

1534
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,410
to bring to you simulation, ultra realistic simulation

1535
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,750
of reality in real time.

1536
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,630
Like lights changing everything.

1537
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:12,360
And then, you know, it just takes you back to

1538
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,770
that feeling I had with "Wolfenstein", but like more,

1539
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:19,227
and you can completely lose yourself in that world

1540
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:22,620
and you would forget that this real world exists.

1541
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:24,420
What is the real world anyway, you know?

1542
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,870
So it's that coupling of great engineering

1543
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,700
and great storytelling

1544
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,340
in terms of just feeling is super cool.

1545
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,200
It's great to know, it's great to know

1546
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,987
that these teams behind it.

1547
01:01:36,987 --> 01:01:38,640
And it's cool that you're also releasing

1548
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,500
a bunch of details around it.

1549
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,850
At least for folks like me.

1550
01:01:43,173 --> 01:01:44,940
It's inspiring to see.

1551
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,990
So Unreal Engine is this fascinating creation.

1552
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:51,240
It's a big, bold, crazy bet that you made.

1553
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,330
Maybe it's good to actually explain what Unreal Engine is

1554
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:57,630
for people sort of outside this world.

1555
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:01,560
I would say it transformed the gaming industry,

1556
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,410
but that was a big bet in 1995

1557
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:08,250
that most of the effort would be on creating

1558
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:10,773
the gaming engine, not the game.

1559
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:15,840
- Yeah, Unreal Engine is a big bundle of code and tools,

1560
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,680
a huge software package

1561
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,940
that provides all the functions you need to build

1562
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,193
any sort of a 3D graphics application.

1563
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,860
Game developers use it to make games

1564
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,480
and that's the predominant use.

1565
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,240
But it's also used in Hollywood film

1566
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,900
and television production to create 3D scenery in real time

1567
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,400
for production sets to do pre-visualization.

1568
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,560
It's used by car makers to visualize their cars

1569
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,833
before they're constructed or manufactured.

1570
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,670
It's used by architects to preview buildings

1571
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:51,210
before they're made and industrial designers of all sorts.

1572
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:52,470
And it provides, you know,

1573
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,410
all of the 3D simulation features you need

1574
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,900
both for creating highly realistic 3D graphics,

1575
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,080
but also physics and interactions

1576
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,300
between objects and making things happen

1577
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:06,030
like you might see in the real world.

1578
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,680
And supports a huge variety of styles

1579
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:12,680
from Pixar stylized movies to cel shading to photorealism.

1580
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,330
And it can be used for anything

1581
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,670
that needs real-time 3D graphics.

1582
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,010
- Including humans that populate

1583
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,780
those three dimensional worlds.

1584
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:25,710
And we'll probably talk a bunch of the details

1585
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:30,710
involved in the process of creating ultra realistic humans

1586
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,707
because we humans care about how other humans look

1587
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:36,780
and how they convey emotion

1588
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:39,990
and express how they speak, all that kind of stuff.

1589
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:44,100
But so yes, it's the 3D objects that are static,

1590
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,380
the 3D objects that are dynamic

1591
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,860
and on the dynamic front,

1592
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,653
including humans that are ultra dynamic.

1593
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:57,000
So all of that, you have to create this engine

1594
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,683
that simulates that world.

1595
01:04:00,509 --> 01:04:03,390
This beautiful world that we know and love.

1596
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,810
Okay, but you know, you're early so

1597
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,500
you see "Doom" and you're trying to create this world

1598
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,610
and trying to create an engine

1599
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:14,190
that would not just power "Unreal" the video game,

1600
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,320
but future video games.

1601
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,360
So how do you go about it?

1602
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,160
What are you thinking and that,

1603
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,213
I should sort of linger on that,

1604
01:04:21,213 --> 01:04:23,790
that is a crazy bet that we're going

1605
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,743
to build an engine as a company.

1606
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,840
- Yeah, well you know, the philosophy began with "ZZT"

1607
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,700
and continued onward.

1608
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,020
We're not just building a game for players to play,

1609
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,000
we're also building tools that could be used

1610
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,610
for building that game or any other game.

1611
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,320
And catering to all the artists

1612
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,240
and designers who had used the tool.

1613
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,070
And so that philosophy started,

1614
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:50,910
it's a very early parts of Unreal development.

1615
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:54,030
I was building the tools for, you know,

1616
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:55,680
level designers like Cliff Bleszinski

1617
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,280
and artists like James Schwaltz.

1618
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,070
And you know, as we began marketing the game

1619
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,510
thinking it was six months away,

1620
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,490
we were constantly releasing screenshots

1621
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:07,140
and things like that.

1622
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,340
Other companies started calling us

1623
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:11,250
and saying they wanted to build 3D games too,

1624
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,290
but they didn't have the expertise for that

1625
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,960
and they wanted to license our 3D engine.

1626
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,023
And this was one of the coolest pivots in Epic's history.

1627
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:22,530
MicroProse called up Mark Rein, our, you know,

1628
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,770
Vice President and longtime business guy

1629
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:28,020
and said they wanted to license our engine.

1630
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:29,970
And Mark Rein was like, "Oh, what?

1631
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:31,216
You wanna license what?

1632
01:05:31,216 --> 01:05:32,847
An engine, what engine?"

1633
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:34,830
And they explained to him what they wanted to license.

1634
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:35,663
He's like, "Oh that engine.

1635
01:05:35,663 --> 01:05:37,360
Yeah, yeah, that's very expensive."

1636
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:38,820
(Tim and Lex laughing)

1637
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,910
But this was one of the critical things that kept Epic going

1638
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:43,860
through that three and a half years.

1639
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,870
We were starting to license our engine out

1640
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,010
to other developers.

1641
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:48,720
MicroProse took two licenses

1642
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,020
and we got in half a million dollars from that

1643
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:55,560
and company GT Interactive licensed our engine

1644
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:59,357
to build another game and we got paid for that.

1645
01:05:59,357 --> 01:06:01,620
And so we had this revenue stream funding

1646
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,990
the development of Unreal Engine from other games

1647
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,490
that were being built by other developers.

1648
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:08,280
And because they were the lifeline for the company,

1649
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:12,000
we took the engine business very seriously from the start.

1650
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,550
We set up, you know, mailing lists

1651
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,560
so that our partners could ask us questions

1652
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,010
and all the developers and artists working on our games

1653
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,020
were participating in helping customers.

1654
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,460
Everybody took that very seriously

1655
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,960
'cause it was our funding source.

1656
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,990
And you know, that's kind of set this dual spirit of Epic

1657
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:29,640
of boning technology

1658
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,470
and supporting game developers simultaneous

1659
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:33,930
with building games and supporting gamers.

1660
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:36,690
It's continued onward and just grown over time.

1661
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:40,170
- Can you just go back to that, you programming,

1662
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,600
what are some interesting technical challenges

1663
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,433
you had to overcome?

1664
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:46,530
You mentioned dynamic lighting, like create, you know,

1665
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,300
create this three dimensional world

1666
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,850
and try to figure out the puzzle of how you actually

1667
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:55,850
do that at a time when nobody, Carmack and you (laughs)

1668
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,040
doing this kind of thing.

1669
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:01,830
It's a totally open wild west.

1670
01:07:01,830 --> 01:07:04,280
So what are some interesting technical challenges

1671
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,840
you had to try to solve?

1672
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,720
- There's a lot, some of them are visible on screen

1673
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,400
and some are behind the scenes

1674
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:13,593
and still require a lot of innovation.

1675
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:16,440
All the graphical techniques

1676
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,140
were really interesting challenges

1677
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:22,290
and Unreal Engine in those early days

1678
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:24,300
went a lot further than the quake engine

1679
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,040
and building environments

1680
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,550
using constructive solid geometry with a realtime editor.

1681
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,900
And that was a really interesting technical challenge.

1682
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,760
You know, the idea is building is extremely tedious

1683
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,130
if you are only adding objects to the world.

1684
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,690
If you wanna build a door, then you need

1685
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:44,910
to add like a dozen different pieces of door frames

1686
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:46,410
and add a bunch of different walls together

1687
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:47,550
to fit together in the right shape.

1688
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:49,020
It sure would be easier if you could just start

1689
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:50,920
with a wall and subtract the door out.

1690
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,600
And so we had this way of adding geometry to the world

1691
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,000
and subtracting geometry and the engine would perform

1692
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,600
all of the calculations on that.

1693
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:01,290
And this is something

1694
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,560
that I'd been anticipating was possible for a long time,

1695
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,435
but when I finally got around to it,

1696
01:08:06,435 --> 01:08:08,260
it took this 30 hour coding session

1697
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:11,400
to like figure out all the special cases of the code

1698
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,020
that needed to be implemented to make that work.

1699
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,600
But you know, in the course of 30 hours

1700
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,540
I got constructive solid geometry up and running.

1701
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,970
I started doing a, you know, like handed it

1702
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,979
to James Schmaltz the next time we were together

1703
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:25,560
and it's like, "Okay, I think you're cheating here."

1704
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,420
So you create a giant Taurus

1705
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:30,207
and then add another giant Taurus interlocked with it

1706
01:08:30,207 --> 01:08:32,760
and then subtracted a cylinder from it

1707
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:36,359
and like created this really advanced composite object

1708
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:37,500
with just three operations.

1709
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,880
He was like, "Whoa, I can't believe this."

1710
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,490
It's like, "Yeah, we figured it out."

1711
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:43,107
And that was cool to see it for the first time,

1712
01:08:43,107 --> 01:08:44,700
but it was probably the first time somebody

1713
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,550
had done constructive solid geometry in real time.

1714
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,990
But it was also a really useful artist tool

1715
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,510
that all the artists appreciated immediately,

1716
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:52,830
began making use of.

1717
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:54,810
- Can you actually speak to that, the 30 hour session?

1718
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:57,330
I mean this is not, from everything I know about

1719
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:59,850
computational geometry, doing this kind of thing

1720
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:03,300
from your perspective, that's not easy.

1721
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,149
That's, what is it?

1722
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:09,393
The uncertainty, the open questions involved.

1723
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:16,260
I mean even just on the algorithm front,

1724
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,800
how to do that efficiently

1725
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,140
and then plus the usual programming thing of debugging,

1726
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:26,069
like suffering through the trickiness of it.

1727
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:27,600
And we don't have really,

1728
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,250
at that time you don't have the tooling

1729
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:32,006
to really visualize everything that's going on really well.

1730
01:09:32,006 --> 01:09:34,740
And you probably like using some crappy editor.

1731
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,590
I mean there's just a lot of like friction here.

1732
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:42,569
So the 30 hour session is one that's probably rough.

1733
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:44,220
It's a rough one.

1734
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,930
- Your brain works in different ways

1735
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:50,002
and depending on your state, right?

1736
01:09:50,002 --> 01:09:51,840
There are some things that require

1737
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,390
really working on a problem fresh.

1738
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:57,150
Where you've put together a bunch of logical pieces

1739
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,890
and now you just need to write a whole lot of code

1740
01:09:58,890 --> 01:10:00,570
to make it all work together.

1741
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:03,450
And, you know, plumb a whole lot of data

1742
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:06,420
between a whole lot of different algorithms.

1743
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,950
But, you know, I think our brains

1744
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:09,330
have vastly more horsepower

1745
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,940
than we're able to directly access

1746
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,313
by thinking of what code to type next.

1747
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:18,270
And you know, after you've been working

1748
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,410
for a very long time,

1749
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,510
you can get into a sleep deprived state

1750
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,340
where you have much, much more direct access

1751
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:24,473
to that low level knowledge.

1752
01:10:24,473 --> 01:10:25,306
(Lex laughing)

1753
01:10:25,306 --> 01:10:26,190
- That's great, yeah.

1754
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:28,050
- You know, because you know their symptoms

1755
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:29,670
that are well studied of sleep deprivation,

1756
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:31,860
one of them is short-term memory loss.

1757
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,260
And so you're working without like

1758
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,900
the easy recall of the code you just typed,

1759
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,083
but your brain is then freed to think about other problems.

1760
01:10:41,426 --> 01:10:43,050
And you know, I built up this intuition

1761
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:45,660
over a very long period of time, you know.

1762
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,490
So the foundation for the subject

1763
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,290
is the binary space partitioning tree.

1764
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:52,290
This data structure invaded by a computer.

1765
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,240
Graphics researcher, Bruce Naylor.

1766
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,660
Carmack had picked up on that and had used the technique

1767
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:00,093
in "Doom" to really great effect.

1768
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:02,187
And I'd picked up on that

1769
01:11:02,187 --> 01:11:04,260
and Unreal Engine was using this technique

1770
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,700
for all of its graphics and rendering,

1771
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,330
but it, yeah, it was just additive geometry everywhere

1772
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:11,250
and it had a lot of overlapping polygons

1773
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,600
and was pretty inefficient.

1774
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,570
So I had the idea that if we had a BSP tree,

1775
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,590
there was a really efficient way

1776
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:18,960
to do constructive solid geometry.

1777
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,660
And to do that you had to break down the ways

1778
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,850
that different pieces of geometry can fit together.

1779
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:26,500
I broke it down into like 14 different cases

1780
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,030
and most of them are pretty simple, cranked them out.

1781
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,010
Anyways, I got towards the end, you know,

1782
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:33,243
there were some pretty complicated things like,

1783
01:11:33,243 --> 01:11:36,180
well how do you deal with coplanar polygons?

1784
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,950
They're in the same plane

1785
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:39,120
and pointing in the same direction

1786
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,590
versus the other direction.

1787
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:41,970
In what cases should you keep them?

1788
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,440
What cases should you eliminate them?

1789
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,400
And so on and so on

1790
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,920
to create really efficient geometry output.

1791
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,270
And you know, just plowing through it, eventually

1792
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:54,090
through mostly deduction, but some trial and error too.

1793
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,400
Like sometimes you just have to try the possibilities

1794
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,960
and see what works.

1795
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,367
Yeah, I cranked it out and it worked

1796
01:11:59,367 --> 01:12:01,860
and the next day I came in like kind of weary

1797
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:03,690
and I was like, "Oh wow, this actually did work.

1798
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:04,740
It wasn't just a dream."

1799
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,810
- So you're considering the edge cases also.

1800
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:08,970
I mean that's the problem with geometry is like

1801
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:11,280
there's probably just gonna be all kinds of weird polygons

1802
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:12,120
that you have to...

1803
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,380
So you're like thinking through,

1804
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,510
you're imagining the edge cases

1805
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:20,490
and trying to see how do I not create inefficiencies

1806
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:23,100
in this algorithm while still considering the edge cases,

1807
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,660
allowing for the edge cases.

1808
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,360
- Yeah, you know, it's pretty easy to write software

1809
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,460
that's like 99% correct.

1810
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,800
It's the 1% that's the really hard part

1811
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:34,533
and where the devil lies in the details.

1812
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:36,750
- What about like lighting?

1813
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,770
Is there other interesting...

1814
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,910
- Well the funny answer is like,

1815
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,420
we know the laws of physics, so it's actually really easy

1816
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,980
to do everything in computer graphics.

1817
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:47,310
But the direct solution of the laws of physics

1818
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,977
is immensely so.

1819
01:12:48,977 --> 01:12:51,510
And so what we're finding are approximations

1820
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,253
rather than complete solutions.

1821
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,100
'Cause you need something that's a million times faster

1822
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,290
than the brute force answer.

1823
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:01,517
- We should say that the physics of the scene

1824
01:13:01,517 --> 01:13:03,330
is you just take a bunch of photons,

1825
01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,690
bounce them around, that's how light works.

1826
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:07,860
That's going to be very inefficient

1827
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:10,230
because it's a lot of bouncing

1828
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:11,760
and a lot of photons.

1829
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,670
- Yeah, yeah, photon tracing is the subject matter

1830
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:17,970
that does brute force calculation of pixels on a screen

1831
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,950
from all of the light in the scene.

1832
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,350
And it works and it's correct

1833
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,540
and it just is an implementation of laws of physics

1834
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,790
and it's millions or billions of times slower

1835
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:28,080
than what we do.

1836
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,790
But Carmack had figured out how to do

1837
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:33,450
really cool lighting algorithms,

1838
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:37,080
including real-time lighting with objects moving around.

1839
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,270
And I hadn't taken it very far.

1840
01:13:39,270 --> 01:13:42,780
So with Unreal Engine I'd realized like

1841
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,930
we don't have nearly enough computing performance

1842
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:49,020
on our CPU to compute the light of every pixel on the screen

1843
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,660
from all of the light sources that affect it.

1844
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,330
Yeah, we were at a six cycle texture mapper

1845
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,760
and we couldn't afford 30 more cycles for lighting.

1846
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,430
And so the answer had to be some approximation.

1847
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,580
And the one that Carmack had picked up on

1848
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,580
in the "Quake" engine was light mapping.

1849
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,813
Instead of calculating all the lighting on every pixel,

1850
01:14:06,813 --> 01:14:09,900
what if we like made a big texture

1851
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,400
that we placed over all of the walls

1852
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,110
in the scene that was like wallpaper.

1853
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,490
And what if we say every foot,

1854
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:15,900
we're gonna compute a lighting value

1855
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,890
for just that one foot grid on the object

1856
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:21,540
rather than computing it everywhere.

1857
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,750
And then what if we just linear interpolate that

1858
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,583
over the course of it?

1859
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:27,873
You know, you get a lighting and solution

1860
01:14:27,873 --> 01:14:30,837
that actually works pretty well and is fast enough to work.

1861
01:14:30,837 --> 01:14:33,330
And so a lot of Unreal Engine's lighting techniques

1862
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,350
were based on light mapping.

1863
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,850
We introduced colored lighting

1864
01:14:36,822 --> 01:14:38,490
so you could have colored light sources.

1865
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:40,110
Then we realized, oh, since we're doing this

1866
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,760
and we're doing it on light maps,

1867
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,860
we can actually do some pretty expensive calculations,

1868
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:46,320
hundreds of cycles since we're only calculating it

1869
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,590
for every one foot of world space rather than every pixel.

1870
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,210
And so we introduced a whole bunch

1871
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:54,280
of elaborate lighting effects like torch flickering

1872
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:57,510
and you know, the caustic effects of water

1873
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:00,243
bouncing off of a surface and so on.

1874
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:02,220
And like pulsing lights

1875
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,480
and blinking lights and everything else.

1876
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,330
And I created a system for compositing them together.

1877
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:08,160
So if you had an arbitrary number of light sources,

1878
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,310
they could all do that.

1879
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,770
And you know, then I implemented a shadowing algorithm.

1880
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:16,980
You know, if you cast a ray from a point

1881
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,750
from a light to a point on a surface

1882
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:21,270
and see if whether it intersects in the other geometry,

1883
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,240
if it doesn't intersect and the light hits the object

1884
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:25,170
and if it does intersect

1885
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:27,120
then the light hits something else first

1886
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,793
and that pixel on the object should be dark.

1887
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,570
So I built a real-time version of this

1888
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:36,401
and it ran at about a half a frame a second.

1889
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:37,234
(Tim and Lex laughing)

1890
01:15:37,234 --> 01:15:38,880
So I was running around at half a frame a second,

1891
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,560
like shooting out light projectiles

1892
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,917
and looking at dynamic lighting, it was like,

1893
01:15:41,917 --> 01:15:43,477
"Someday computers will be fast enough

1894
01:15:43,477 --> 01:15:45,537
for this, but not today."

1895
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,120
So I made a non-real-time version

1896
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,650
that precalculate all the lighting

1897
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,140
and realized, oh wait, if you precalculated the shadowing

1898
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,975
on an object, you can still apply the lighting dynamically

1899
01:15:54,975 --> 01:15:56,220
as long as the light's not moving.

1900
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:58,920
So you could do torch flickering with shadows

1901
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,080
and you know, figure it out all the cases of dynamic

1902
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,760
and static lighting that were actually practical

1903
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,890
on a computer at the time and exposed them to artists.

1904
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:06,643
And this was the wonderful thing.

1905
01:16:06,643 --> 01:16:10,320
I was just like typing in these old features,

1906
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:11,340
exposing them to artists

1907
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,990
and every day they'd find like a dropdown

1908
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,850
with some more lighting options available to them

1909
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,083
and they'd start using them and they'd do things

1910
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,673
that I never thought possible.

1911
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,307
And this was always the coolest thing,

1912
01:16:20,307 --> 01:16:22,860
as a programmer building an engine,

1913
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,900
you might think you know the implications

1914
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:27,030
of the feature you're building, but artists are so clever

1915
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:29,730
that you always find that you've built the capability

1916
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:32,130
of doing vastly more than you ever anticipated as they start

1917
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,290
to use combinations of features together

1918
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:36,870
in concert to do ever more amazing things.

1919
01:16:36,870 --> 01:16:39,900
- That's the genius of artists is they're given constraints

1920
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:41,910
and within those constraints they create something

1921
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:44,280
you could have never possibly imagined

1922
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,960
given the constraints.

1923
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,790
That's such a beautiful coupling

1924
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:51,720
between engineering and artistry and art.

1925
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,190
- That's right, and it's timeless, you know,

1926
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:55,800
what did the renaissance painters do with paints

1927
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,420
and what do the early game artists do with early engines?

1928
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,310
You know, everybody's figuring out the capabilities

1929
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:05,100
of their medium and you're seeing a revolution.

1930
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,560
- This is blowing my mind. This is so fun.

1931
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,020
What about fog? You mentioned fog.

1932
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,870
I don't even know, how do you even do fog?

1933
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:16,500
So you mentioned "Unreal," so the first version had fog.

1934
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,200
- Yeah, well it was a funny thing.

1935
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:23,010
So this graphics hardware company had just started up

1936
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,930
in Finland and they released a screenshot

1937
01:17:24,930 --> 01:17:26,190
of what their GPU was doing

1938
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:29,310
and they showed a scene filled with volumetric fog.

1939
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:31,860
She had a foggy room with some light sources in it.

1940
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,860
And when that happens in the real world, what you see are

1941
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,060
glows around the lights

1942
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,520
as the light brightens the fog around it.

1943
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,500
But the brightening of the fog diminishes over time

1944
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,787
because the fog absorbs some lighting.

1945
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:44,137
And so the further you get away from the light,

1946
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:46,950
the more falloff there is.

1947
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,930
And you know, you have a bunch of colored lights

1948
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,790
overlapping together in a space like that.

1949
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:52,890
The effect is just absolutely magical.

1950
01:17:52,890 --> 01:17:54,540
You know, like being out on a foggy light

1951
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:55,740
with street lamps above.

1952
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,260
It's something that's surreal and looked just beautiful.

1953
01:17:58,260 --> 01:17:59,610
So I was like, "Oh my God, they figured out

1954
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,170
how to do realtime value metric fog.

1955
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:03,600
I have to figure it out myself."

1956
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,885
And so that was another like 30 hour coding section.

1957
01:18:05,885 --> 01:18:08,490
(Lex laughing) - Nice.

1958
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:09,960
- But like at the core I realized, okay,

1959
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,690
what's happening here is we have this lighting function

1960
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:16,080
saying that light at a particular point in space

1961
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,730
is like, you know,

1962
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:20,280
falling off with the inverse square of the light,

1963
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,960
light the distance from the light source, right?

1964
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:24,570
The inverse square is all from Isaac Newton,

1965
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,683
which applies to lighting.

1966
01:18:25,683 --> 01:18:28,260
What I had to realize was the way the fog interacted

1967
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:30,960
with the light was that you calculate the view

1968
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,330
from your eyes position to a point on the surface

1969
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:34,440
in the world.

1970
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,270
It's going through fog and you're accumulating more

1971
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:38,640
and more light as a function of the amount

1972
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,067
of light illuminating the fog at that point in time.

1973
01:18:41,067 --> 01:18:44,610
And so, well, you know, I'd studied that (laughs)

1974
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:46,410
in mechanical engineering without even knowing it.

1975
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:47,880
That's the line integral, you know,

1976
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,100
you have an integral over a line of some function.

1977
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,750
Well this is exactly what it's for.

1978
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:54,120
It's for accumulating the values of a function

1979
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,710
over a continuous space and time.

1980
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:57,960
And you know, I did a bunch of math

1981
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,720
and realized that oh wow, the integral,

1982
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,250
and then I looked in a reference book

1983
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:04,080
of all of the integrals and you know,

1984
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,170
thankfully people had solved them all.

1985
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,380
And I realized the integral of, you know,

1986
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:10,110
this transformed one over R squared turns out

1987
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:13,530
to be solved by the arc tangent of R.

1988
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:14,730
And so, you know,

1989
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:17,550
if you calculate some parameters

1990
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:18,780
based on the position of the eye

1991
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,670
and the position of the surface

1992
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,770
point you're at ultimately seeing,

1993
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:23,850
then you calculate exactly

1994
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:26,328
how much fog you can accumulate from that.

1995
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:27,510
But of course you can't do that per pixel

1996
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:29,787
'cause that's hundreds of cycles of CPU time.

1997
01:19:29,787 --> 01:19:32,650
And so what we had to do is calculate volumetric fog

1998
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:35,760
on something equivalent to a light map,

1999
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:39,693
but calculating fog every square meter in the world.

2000
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,080
And so, you know, we had enough performance for that,

2001
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,900
built volumetric lighting and gave it to the artists

2002
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,570
and they started building magically detailed levels

2003
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,850
with volumetric fog and in real time.

2004
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,920
And then, you know, decades later

2005
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,570
I was talking to one of the engineers

2006
01:19:54,570 --> 01:19:55,770
who'd worked on that hardware

2007
01:19:55,770 --> 01:19:57,150
and asked about their volumetric fog

2008
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:00,810
and told them how it inspired me to, you know,

2009
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:02,337
figure out how to do it in real time myself.

2010
01:20:02,337 --> 01:20:04,350
And I was like, "Oh no, we cheated,

2011
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:06,870
we just rendered it our 3D Studio Max."

2012
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,790
- That's awesome. That is so awesome.

2013
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:11,220
That is so inspiring on so many levels.

2014
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:15,240
That you saw that maybe it's possible even if it was

2015
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,930
kind of smoke and mirrors

2016
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:20,400
and then you actually made it happen.

2017
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,100
It's so inspiring to hear these kind of stories

2018
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:24,833
when there's so much uncertainty

2019
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,600
and so many constraints

2020
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,090
and you figure out how to bring it to life in real time

2021
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:33,030
and create this world that Unreal did.

2022
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:34,320
Maybe if we could just pause,

2023
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:37,200
since you mentioned John Carmack a few times.

2024
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:40,620
As a fellow pioneer in the game industry at that time,

2025
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:42,183
what do you admire about John?

2026
01:20:44,025 --> 01:20:48,730
- John singularly has this intense dedication

2027
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:54,210
to getting the best result from his code

2028
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:57,840
and having absolutely no attachment to passed code.

2029
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,450
And some of the legendary things he did,

2030
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:02,250
the end result was an absolute breakthrough

2031
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,900
in real-time computer graphics.

2032
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,860
Weren't his first try.

2033
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,920
They were like his seventh or eighth try

2034
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,530
after he'd done something time and time again,

2035
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:12,480
tried it, found a better approach,

2036
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,190
thrown out the old one, build it again

2037
01:21:14,190 --> 01:21:15,540
and continually re-wrote out his code

2038
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:18,900
until he found the absolute best solution to a problem.

2039
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:21,720
And you know, I think that stands as a lesson

2040
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,220
for every programmer to pick up on.

2041
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:25,800
When something is really, really important,

2042
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,100
its performance is absolutely critical to the product

2043
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:31,230
or its quality or its capabilities.

2044
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:34,890
Just iterate on it until you've achieved perfection

2045
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,930
and don't settle for the first

2046
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,630
or second solution is good enough.

2047
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:42,000
- And it's, you know, the result of that,

2048
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,420
both you and him sort of define the future of gaming,

2049
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,100
of gaming worlds.

2050
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:48,960
It's so beautiful to see.

2051
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,820
It's just fascinating.

2052
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,450
It's inspiring because like under so much uncertainty,

2053
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:58,350
under so many constraints, you figure out a way

2054
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:00,660
and that, you know, actually continues to this day

2055
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:05,660
because yes, the hardware is improved incredibly,

2056
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:10,440
but in order to create an ultra realistic,

2057
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:15,000
highly dynamic, real-time rendering of the world around us,

2058
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,620
it's still really, really difficult.

2059
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,510
And there's all these kinds of optimization,

2060
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:19,620
like you mentioned.

2061
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,070
Maybe you can speak to that

2062
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:24,180
Unreal Engine 1 journey

2063
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:28,773
from 1 to 5.5 or 0.6 now.

2064
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:35,220
For 30 years you've been creating virtual worlds,

2065
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:37,650
what's it like evolving a game engine

2066
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:39,070
for those 30 years

2067
01:22:40,451 --> 01:22:42,030
when the hardware under you

2068
01:22:42,030 --> 01:22:44,190
is improving exponentially?

2069
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:45,240
What are some things

2070
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,000
that changed and what are some universal truths

2071
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,950
that have not changed?

2072
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,690
- It's been an astonishing experience.

2073
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:54,480
Nobody 30 years ago had anticipated

2074
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,730
that we'd see the performance gains in hardware

2075
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:58,680
that we've actually seen in that timeframe.

2076
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:01,200
It's something like a hundred thousand times

2077
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,700
higher CPU performance

2078
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:04,590
between multiple cores and higher clock rates

2079
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,360
and more parallelism.

2080
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:09,120
Like, you know, if we had that in aviation,

2081
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:12,420
then we'd be like taking a trip to neighboring stars.

2082
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,523
- [Lex] Alpha Centauri, yeah. - Exactly.

2083
01:23:15,844 --> 01:23:18,750
And in graphics it's been even more so.

2084
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,990
It's something like literally 10 million times more

2085
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,403
net usable GP performance

2086
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:26,620
than we had back running on a Pentium 90 CPU

2087
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:29,700
all in 30 years.

2088
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,340
And you know, it's really made me appreciate

2089
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,480
that over the generations,

2090
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,700
some areas of our engine development

2091
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:38,133
have absolutely kept up with technology.

2092
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,560
And you know, the rendering team

2093
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,520
that works on Unreal Engine

2094
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,270
are the real miracle workers there.

2095
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:47,970
Just about every generation of Unreal we've replaced

2096
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:50,913
most of the rendering code and you know,

2097
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,060
the different leaders and different points in times

2098
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:55,983
and the different luminaries have built systems

2099
01:23:55,983 --> 01:23:58,620
that were absolutely rethought

2100
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:02,760
and optimized for the latest generation of hardware.

2101
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:05,160
You know, Unreal Engine 1 was built for software entering

2102
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:07,350
and then the Voodoo 1 came along late in the cycle

2103
01:24:07,350 --> 01:24:08,370
and we had support for it,

2104
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:12,300
but it wasn't fully capable and utilized.

2105
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,160
Unreal Engine 2 was about bringing

2106
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,560
all the latest GPU hardware acceleration features

2107
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,690
to the engine and you know, keeping forward

2108
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:20,790
and honing some new features like vehicles

2109
01:24:21,901 --> 01:24:23,433
and a few other capabilities.

2110
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,510
And this was in the early GPU era

2111
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:31,740
before GPU had really broken out of, you know,

2112
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,200
everybody's expectations of Moore's Law.

2113
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:36,960
But that breakout occurred with DirectX 9

2114
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,310
and the capabilities of, you know,

2115
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:39,390
programmable shaders.

2116
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:42,750
Once you had control of writing code running on the GPU

2117
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:45,330
that could color every pixel on the screen.

2118
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:47,460
And that GPU code was literally a factor

2119
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:51,210
of a hundred times faster than the equivalent code

2120
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:53,733
I wrote a few years earlier in the Pentium 90.

2121
01:24:55,243 --> 01:24:58,440
And so that DirectX 9 generation was a godsend.

2122
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,850
And Andrew Scheidecker,

2123
01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:03,090
a longtime Epic luminary wrote the core

2124
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:05,170
of the Unreal Engine 3 render around

2125
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:09,360
real-time pixel shading, real-time lighting,

2126
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,040
being able to do dynamic shadows

2127
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,740
using several different techniques

2128
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:18,180
and multi-thread the render to support bits of, you know,

2129
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:20,760
the early dual core CPUs that were starting

2130
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:21,963
to show up at the time.

2131
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:25,563
And it was a massive, massive graphical upgrade.

2132
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:29,790
Unreal Engine 4 made a number of improvements

2133
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:33,330
and just continued to add features to give artists

2134
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:35,580
more and more options for lighting

2135
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:38,133
and for geometry that created realism.

2136
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:43,290
But then I think probably our biggest single level of leap

2137
01:25:43,290 --> 01:25:44,610
came with Unreal Engine 5

2138
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:48,030
with a Nanite micropolygon geometry solution,

2139
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:50,973
and with Lumen the global illumination lighting solution.

2140
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:54,540
You know, which I think really bridged the gap

2141
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:58,653
from, you know, game-ish computer graphics to,

2142
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:02,190
you know, total observable photo realism

2143
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:04,263
for artists who wanted to create that.

2144
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,260
And so that's been the evolution

2145
01:26:07,260 --> 01:26:09,480
and the progress on the graphics side

2146
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:10,980
is absolutely astonishing.

2147
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:13,440
As it is on the audio side and a number of other areas.

2148
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:15,660
But parts of the engine also haven't changed

2149
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:19,383
all that much since the version I wrote and chipped in 1998.

2150
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:23,880
You know, the a file management system

2151
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,590
has been optimized a number of times,

2152
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:28,080
but it hasn't been completely rethought.

2153
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:32,220
And the networking system, the ways that clients

2154
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:34,890
and servers talk together and negotiate game state

2155
01:26:34,890 --> 01:26:37,650
is still an evolution of the thing I wrote.

2156
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,570
And you know, it's feeling kind of dated now.

2157
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,510
You still see networking bugs in "Fortnite" where like

2158
01:26:42,510 --> 01:26:44,580
for some reason when you're spectating you're not seeing

2159
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:45,600
some parameters update.

2160
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,570
Well that's because of the lossful nature

2161
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:49,820
of that networking model.

2162
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:53,540
And the biggest limitation that's built up over time

2163
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:56,540
is the single-threaded nature of game simulation

2164
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,140
on Unreal Engine.

2165
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:59,880
We run a single-threaded simulation.

2166
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,970
You know, if you have a 16 core CPU, we're using one core

2167
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:04,620
for game simulation

2168
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:06,390
and running the rest of the complicated game logic

2169
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:08,850
because single-thread programming is orders of magnitude

2170
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:11,220
easier than multi-thread programming.

2171
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:14,490
And we didn't want to burden either ourselves

2172
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:16,170
or our partners or the community

2173
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:18,363
with the complications of multi-threading.

2174
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:20,910
And you know, over time

2175
01:27:20,910 --> 01:27:23,160
that becomes increasing limitation, you know,

2176
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:24,840
so we're really thinking about

2177
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,780
and working on the next generation of technology

2178
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,610
and that, you know, being Unreal Engine 6

2179
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,740
and that's the generation we're actually going to go

2180
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:34,470
and address a number of the really core limitations

2181
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:37,380
that have been with us over the history of Unreal Engine

2182
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:40,380
and get those on the, you know, a better foundation

2183
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:43,680
that, you know, the modern world deserves, given everything

2184
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,480
that's been learned in the field of computing

2185
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,350
in that timeframe,

2186
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:50,370
- That's a terrifyingly challenging engineering problem.

2187
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:53,583
And it seems like every version of Unreal Engine,

2188
01:27:55,380 --> 01:27:57,900
the amazing teams behind it are willing

2189
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:02,013
to just throw away most of the code. (laughs)

2190
01:28:02,013 --> 01:28:03,300
And maybe I'm being a little bit too dramatic,

2191
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:06,150
but basically throw away the old approaches

2192
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,700
like you mentioned with Carmack

2193
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:13,110
and start again, like with Nanite and Lumen,

2194
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,740
just keep optimizing to the current hardware,

2195
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:19,470
but even like rethinking how it's all done.

2196
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:22,920
But going from single-threaded to multi-threaded.

2197
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,750
Oh boy, that's terrifying.

2198
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:26,700
And that's in part we'll talk about it,

2199
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:29,250
why maybe you have to rethink

2200
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:32,100
even the programming language that's being used

2201
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:33,870
to rethink a lot of things.

2202
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:37,440
That's fascinating. Can we just stick on Unreal Engine 5?

2203
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,320
So I watched a bunch of stuff,

2204
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,077
but the state of Unreal in GGC 2024.

2205
01:28:44,077 --> 01:28:45,150
(Lex laughing)

2206
01:28:45,150 --> 01:28:48,900
Thank you, I was just giggling

2207
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,180
with excitement watching some of this stuff,

2208
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:54,990
so just if we can talk about different things here

2209
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:56,340
just to nerd out a little bit.

2210
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:00,048
So people should go watch this video.

2211
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:01,398
They talked about the dirt,

2212
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,640
just the ultra realistic,

2213
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,210
and this is for "Marvel 1943,"

2214
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:10,920
which is kind of putting the Marvel universe

2215
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:15,920
into Nazi occupied France in the winter.

2216
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:18,240
So there's snow.

2217
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:21,030
And you know, that's a moment in history,

2218
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:23,490
that's a very intense moment in history

2219
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:27,237
and it really creates a feeling and puts you there

2220
01:29:27,237 --> 01:29:31,170
and there's so much to that including the snow.

2221
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:35,280
But just, you know, looking at the dirt is a really nice way

2222
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,780
to show like how do you (sighs)

2223
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:44,780
add a lot of details to the scene in real time

2224
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:48,540
that like gives this experience

2225
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:51,030
like infinite detail.

2226
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:54,360
Like this is real, this is super real.

2227
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,330
And then I think in the talk they describe

2228
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:02,130
what's entailed in the generation of the geometry,

2229
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:04,950
what's entailed in the lighting, all that kind of stuff.

2230
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:08,143
Maybe can you speak about dirt? (laughs)

2231
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,070
What are the components for people

2232
01:30:11,070 --> 01:30:15,870
who might not know in like creating this ultra realistic,

2233
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:18,843
the texture, the lighting, the geometry, all of that.

2234
01:30:18,843 --> 01:30:21,930
Like how Nanite, how Lumen all come together

2235
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:24,690
in this beautiful orchestra to paint in real time

2236
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:29,690
the dirt in Nazi occupied France in 1943. (laughs)

2237
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,040
- Yeah, there's a lot happening here on screen

2238
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,910
and you know, the real hero of of this image isn't Epic,

2239
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:38,010
it's the artists and technical artists

2240
01:30:38,010 --> 01:30:41,130
who work together to build this environment because it,

2241
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:44,160
and the reason we showed it at GDC was it went way, way

2242
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:47,163
beyond what we realized the system was capable of doing.

2243
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:49,890
You know, largely because of their brilliance.

2244
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:52,140
And this is the magic of computer graphics.

2245
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:53,940
There's not one feature that makes this cool.

2246
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,300
There's a dozen technical features that each interplay

2247
01:30:57,300 --> 01:31:00,933
and because of the ways that they interplay with each other,

2248
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:04,050
it's hard to actually identify

2249
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,760
the individual components of it.

2250
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,010
One thing that's happening here that's really critical...

2251
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:10,710
Oh yeah, now we're seeing it being turned off is

2252
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:12,210
the lighting happening.

2253
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:13,830
The Lumen lighting system

2254
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:16,800
that's powering the scene is doing different

2255
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,070
kinds of lighting calculations at different scales.

2256
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:24,330
This was the work of Daniel Wright following a decade

2257
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:27,000
of moving the state of the art of lighting forward.

2258
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:31,050
But his theory, which was rather controversial at the time,

2259
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:36,050
was that if you have enough levels of lighting calculation,

2260
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:39,000
then you can get everything

2261
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,860
global illumination working everywhere

2262
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:43,708
from the absolute highest levels of a scene,

2263
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:45,180
you know, that buildings are casting crack shadows,

2264
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:48,300
all the way down to details like you see on the dirt here,

2265
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,860
all working in concert

2266
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,530
and without distinguishable boundaries.

2267
01:31:52,530 --> 01:31:55,770
So there is a good decade of foundational work there

2268
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:57,270
to make the lighting work.

2269
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:01,140
In particular when you see the very detailed shadows

2270
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:02,577
interplaying between the, you know,

2271
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:07,380
the ice and the dirt there, that's screen space lighting.

2272
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:10,143
There's actually shadow calculation going on,

2273
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:16,350
not based on the world but on the pixels on the screen

2274
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:17,610
because that is the only way

2275
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:19,980
that we could possibly do those calculations fast enough

2276
01:32:19,980 --> 01:32:21,360
running them on a pixel shader.

2277
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,860
- Yeah, watch this,

2278
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,700
watch when you add the objects, when you add the textures,

2279
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,070
the different layering all the shadows

2280
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:30,570
that have to be computed.

2281
01:32:30,570 --> 01:32:32,820
- Yeah, yeah. - Boy. (laughs)

2282
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:33,990
- That shadowing is the amazing thing.

2283
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:37,230
But you know, the reason that works is counterintuitive.

2284
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:39,517
When somebody first explained it to me, I was like,

2285
01:32:39,517 --> 01:32:42,450
"That's really clever, but I don't think that will work."

2286
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:43,410
But it does work

2287
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:47,100
because if you observe the positions of incoming lights

2288
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,770
and you know the z coordinates

2289
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:51,600
of the different pixels on the screen, you can figure out

2290
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:54,210
how, you know, geometry there is likely

2291
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:56,010
to occlude other geometry.

2292
01:32:56,010 --> 01:32:57,540
And even though it's only an approximation

2293
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:00,510
and not isn't perfect, it looks perfectly good

2294
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:04,410
to the human eye and gives you the subtle shadowing

2295
01:33:04,410 --> 01:33:05,940
that you see in a scene like this

2296
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:08,850
that it makes it look highly realistic

2297
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:11,430
and the shadowing influences other things.

2298
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:12,720
There's also, you know,

2299
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,090
some really interesting things happening with the color here

2300
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,820
and I'm not even sure what's causing, you know,

2301
01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,880
it looks like color is bleeding from some parts of the snow

2302
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,140
onto other parts of the snow.

2303
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,410
It looks like there's some subsurface scattering going on.

2304
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:29,460
I'm not even sure if that's being used in the scene.

2305
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:32,580
And then there's a material layering system for laying down,

2306
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:36,120
you know, layers of material, dirt and snow

2307
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,880
and other things all making that work.

2308
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,450
And then there's the light bouncing off of the geometry,

2309
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,860
which is another system for lighting

2310
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:47,220
on top of the global illumination system.

2311
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,260
- What about reflections too?

2312
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,390
Is that count as the light balance?

2313
01:33:51,390 --> 01:33:53,130
So there's a light balancing off of stuff

2314
01:33:53,130 --> 01:33:55,500
to light it up in different interesting ways,

2315
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:57,840
but then there's also actually literal reflections

2316
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,560
in like we're looking at a puddle in the dirt.

2317
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,880
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

2318
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,530
But the engine supports a number

2319
01:34:04,530 --> 01:34:05,640
of different reflection techniques.

2320
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:09,150
One is calculating basically textures that reflect,

2321
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:10,890
that capture all the lighting in the scene

2322
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:14,670
and then bouncing that off of texture maps.

2323
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:16,350
So you can see different lights bouncing off

2324
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:17,940
of different pixels in different ways.

2325
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,830
And then there's individual lighting

2326
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:22,170
casting reflections off of things too.

2327
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:25,050
And a lot of this is under the control of designers

2328
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:27,900
and you know, one of the things that's yet to do problem

2329
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:31,830
for the future is you don't just like press a few buttons

2330
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:33,630
and this kind of scene magically appears.

2331
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:36,540
This is a lot of work from some highly skilled people,

2332
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,310
not only building out this particular scene,

2333
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:39,960
but in setting up the material layers

2334
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,930
so that you get the dirt with the ice layered on top

2335
01:34:42,930 --> 01:34:44,401
and all the reflections working

2336
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:46,290
and they need to make a number of technical art decisions

2337
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:47,190
to make this work.

2338
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:49,920
And if a novice who hadn't, you know,

2339
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,720
worked very hard built the kind of scene like this,

2340
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,820
it wouldn't look nearly as good.

2341
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:55,280
So one of the challenges we have is

2342
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,290
to make building this kind of quality level

2343
01:34:58,290 --> 01:35:00,480
even easier and more seamless and automatic.

2344
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:01,590
You'd like to just build a scene

2345
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:03,270
and say, use this material here

2346
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:05,270
and have this appearance come out of it.

2347
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:08,520
- Yeah, and I mean once you create the scene

2348
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,450
you could do things.

2349
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:11,407
I remember where they said like,

2350
01:35:11,407 --> 01:35:13,680
"Can you turn off the headlights?"

2351
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:16,770
I forget you could control the lighting.

2352
01:35:16,770 --> 01:35:20,850
I mean all of this we should say like, this is dynamic.

2353
01:35:20,850 --> 01:35:22,470
So you could change the position of the light,

2354
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:25,500
you can turn on the lights and off the lights,

2355
01:35:25,500 --> 01:35:26,400
that's incredible.

2356
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,983
So this is all real time.

2357
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:33,270
The geometry, the lighting, the textures,

2358
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,070
all of it, real time.

2359
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:38,670
- This is the power of awesome technical art,

2360
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:40,230
three decades of feature development,

2361
01:35:40,230 --> 01:35:42,510
and like you have to give credit

2362
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:46,950
also to the 20 teraflops of graphics performance,

2363
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,570
that NVIDIA's delivering.

2364
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:51,270
- Thanks NVIDIA. (Tim and Lex laughing)

2365
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:55,213
- 90 megahertz to this, 90 megahertz is 90 megaflops.

2366
01:35:55,213 --> 01:35:58,680
This is 20 teraflops. That's a big change.

2367
01:35:58,680 --> 01:35:59,610
- That's a lot.

2368
01:35:59,610 --> 01:36:01,170
So one of the other things

2369
01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:03,750
that they talk about in the presentation is about snow.

2370
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:07,950
So you have to, if you're talking about 1943 Nazi Germany

2371
01:36:07,950 --> 01:36:09,813
in the winter, you know,

2372
01:36:11,906 --> 01:36:13,380
you have to create a feeling,

2373
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:17,820
one of which is the season, the winter, the cold,

2374
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:20,160
and you can control the, you know,

2375
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,410
you have to cover everything in snow.

2376
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:25,680
And here shown is the ability to control

2377
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:28,195
how much snow covers the objects.

2378
01:36:28,195 --> 01:36:33,195
So the ability to do that for the artist is incredible.

2379
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:34,860
Like just to control

2380
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:38,910
how much snow is in the scene dynamically like that.

2381
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:40,080
That's cool.

2382
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,024
- Yeah, yeah. - That's really cool.

2383
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:43,530
- It's a cool system for material layering

2384
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:46,050
and a dozen pieces coming together here.

2385
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,820
You also notice, you know, there's a fogginess

2386
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:49,587
and there's some hot objects emanating fog.

2387
01:36:49,587 --> 01:36:51,723
You know, an artist did that,

2388
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:53,733
that didn't just arise automatically.

2389
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,400
- So that's called material layering.

2390
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,230
So an artist creates the different materials

2391
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:02,700
and are able to like layer the scene with it.

2392
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:04,440
- Yeah, layer materials on top of each other

2393
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:07,170
and see how much of each material should be protruding

2394
01:37:07,170 --> 01:37:09,480
in different places with the engine handling transitions

2395
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:10,560
and things like that.

2396
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,416
- And that's on top of the sort of the geometry

2397
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:15,360
that creates the structure of the scene

2398
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,270
and all the occlusions that have to be computed, man.

2399
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:19,830
Okay, I gotta go to the other one

2400
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:24,063
that was just blowing my mind, which is smoke.

2401
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:27,686
Let me see that, look at that.

2402
01:37:27,686 --> 01:37:30,406
- Yeah. Yeah. (Lex laughing)

2403
01:37:30,406 --> 01:37:34,950
- Oh, there's a fire,

2404
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:39,480
there's a fire in a trash can with the smoke

2405
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,740
and the lighting and the shadows

2406
01:37:43,619 --> 01:37:44,919
interplaying on the smoke.

2407
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:48,330
This is real time?

2408
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:49,680
- Yeah, that's all real time.

2409
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,853
- What the hell?

2410
01:37:51,690 --> 01:37:53,790
How do you do that? (laughs)

2411
01:37:53,790 --> 01:37:55,320
How do you do the smoke?

2412
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,690
Well there's a really powerful particle system underneath,

2413
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:00,990
it's providing the technological foundations

2414
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:01,823
for this sort of thing.

2415
01:38:01,823 --> 01:38:04,210
But there's awesome artistry on top of that

2416
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,070
and an awesome physics engine powering it.

2417
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:10,950
It's hard to tell exactly which piece is doing what,

2418
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:13,530
but you have several different particle systems there.

2419
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:15,330
There's one for the fire

2420
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:18,573
and then there's another one for the smoke coming out of it.

2421
01:38:20,044 --> 01:38:21,030
The really interesting thing happening

2422
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:24,090
with the smoke here is that it's occluding light.

2423
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:25,680
You know, there's calculation of

2424
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,840
how the light should diminish as it travels through smoke.

2425
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,520
And so you're seeing the lighting on the smoke

2426
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,270
being the really interesting thing.

2427
01:38:32,578 --> 01:38:33,600
And there have been a lot of attempts,

2428
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,220
but this was the first demo

2429
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:39,093
where I felt like this kind of smoke had really,

2430
01:38:40,324 --> 01:38:41,490
it no longer looked like a video game.

2431
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:44,310
It looked like just, you know, a burning trash can,

2432
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:46,113
billowing out dark smoke.

2433
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:51,243
And yeah, it's the artist sophistication.

2434
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,660
It's a very, very, very large part of it.

2435
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:58,156
- So yeah, again, it's the interplay between the tooling

2436
01:38:58,156 --> 01:38:59,130
and the artist.

2437
01:38:59,130 --> 01:39:02,130
But yeah, like I could watch that for a long time.

2438
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:04,150
I mean there's something magical

2439
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,850
sitting around a fire in real life

2440
01:39:08,850 --> 01:39:10,500
and just watching the fire and the smoke.

2441
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:13,150
I mean humans have been doing that for, I don't know,

2442
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:17,160
hundreds of thousands of years maybe.

2443
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:20,640
And then that same, I was just staring at that

2444
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:23,610
and I wish the people would just stop talking

2445
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:25,665
and I could just watch the fire infinitely.

2446
01:39:25,665 --> 01:39:26,880
(Tim and Lex laughing)

2447
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,350
And that, I mean that's immersion.

2448
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:29,580
That's like I want to be in that.

2449
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:31,620
I want to sit around that trash can with a fire

2450
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,680
and the smoke and watch and maybe warm my...

2451
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:37,620
'Cause I was also feeling cold because of the snow.

2452
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,570
You're like, you really get immersed into the thing.

2453
01:39:39,570 --> 01:39:40,650
I mean it's so beautiful.

2454
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,810
It's true art. It's true art.

2455
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:45,900
It's just really wonderfully done. But, okay.

2456
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,210
So I gotta ask you about the humans.

2457
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:52,980
We talked about what's it like to create the scenes,

2458
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:56,520
but you know, creating realistic humans is really tough.

2459
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,230
Can you speak to that?

2460
01:39:58,230 --> 01:40:01,590
How to create ultra realistic humans?

2461
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:05,610
So you have an actor behind this to convey emotion,

2462
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:08,430
show the nuances and the details of the faces

2463
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:09,810
and maybe this is a good opportunity

2464
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:12,510
to also mention MetaHuman Creator

2465
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:14,473
that's part of Unreal Engine.

2466
01:40:14,473 --> 01:40:15,306
- Yeah, that's right.

2467
01:40:15,306 --> 01:40:18,300
Humans are by far the hardest part of computer graphics

2468
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:20,580
because millions of years of evolution

2469
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:23,130
have given us dedicated brain systems

2470
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:27,570
to detect patterns and faces and infer emotions and intent

2471
01:40:27,570 --> 01:40:29,310
because cavemen had to,

2472
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:31,590
when they see a stranger determine whether they were likely

2473
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:33,890
friendly or they might be trying to kill them.

2474
01:40:34,751 --> 01:40:38,070
And so humans, we people in the world

2475
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:41,490
have extraordinarily detailed expectations of a face

2476
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,830
and we can notice imperfections

2477
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:45,210
especially perfections arising

2478
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:47,970
from computer graphics limitations,

2479
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:50,250
but it becomes by far the hardest problem.

2480
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:54,570
So the MetaHumans effort is part of a decade long initiative

2481
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:56,037
that Vlad Mastilovic,

2482
01:40:56,037 --> 01:41:00,090
the most talented digital humans visionary in the world

2483
01:41:00,090 --> 01:41:01,800
has been working on

2484
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,083
for generations and generations of games.

2485
01:41:05,281 --> 01:41:07,740
You know, serving individual clients

2486
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:09,270
around the game industry for a while

2487
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:12,270
and then joining Epic as part of the three lateral team.

2488
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,430
And leading now a worldwide effort to build

2489
01:41:14,430 --> 01:41:15,990
all of the technologies required

2490
01:41:15,990 --> 01:41:17,970
to make digital humans realistic.

2491
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:19,740
Okay, one part is capturing humans.

2492
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,620
And so we built really advanced dedicated hardware

2493
01:41:22,620 --> 01:41:25,710
that puts a human in a capture sphere

2494
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:28,890
with dozens of cameras in them taking high resolution,

2495
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:30,390
high frame rate video of them

2496
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:32,700
as they go through a range of motions.

2497
01:41:32,700 --> 01:41:34,770
And then capturing the human face is complicated

2498
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:36,447
because the nuanced detail of our faces

2499
01:41:36,447 --> 01:41:39,540
and how all the muscles and sinews and fat work together

2500
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:41,430
to give us different expressions.

2501
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:43,560
So it's not only about the shape of a person's face,

2502
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,480
but it's also about the entire range of motion

2503
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,800
that they might go through.

2504
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,107
Capturing one human requires,

2505
01:41:49,107 --> 01:41:50,520
you know, a few hours of capture work

2506
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:52,410
in a dedicated environment like that.

2507
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:57,090
Then thousands of hours of processing work to capture

2508
01:41:57,090 --> 01:41:59,910
a precise and, you know, real time replicatable version

2509
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:02,790
of that human in the environment.

2510
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:03,870
And so one of the things that

2511
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:05,580
that's done is just capturing an actor

2512
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:06,810
or actress in the real world

2513
01:42:06,810 --> 01:42:08,100
and then using them in a video game.

2514
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:10,800
But the much more interesting thing going on is capturing

2515
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,740
thousands of humans to form a data set whose goal is

2516
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:18,060
to encompass the entire range of faces in all of humanity.

2517
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,580
So, you know, going around every culture, every continent,

2518
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:24,390
every age and every face of variety

2519
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:25,860
and capturing representative people

2520
01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:28,293
so the entire range of faces is represented.

2521
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:31,140
And then being able to combine

2522
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:32,790
and merge those together

2523
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:35,013
to enable recreating an arbitrary face

2524
01:42:35,013 --> 01:42:37,560
that the system's never seen before.

2525
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:40,470
So you know, one of the ideas is capture giant amounts

2526
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:42,480
of this high precision data

2527
01:42:42,480 --> 01:42:46,980
and you use it to reconstruct a face at a consumer level.

2528
01:42:46,980 --> 01:42:49,770
Like maybe, you know, take an iPhone photo

2529
01:42:49,770 --> 01:42:52,080
of somebody's face and then capture a very accurate

2530
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,117
depiction of that, not by synthesizing it then

2531
01:42:54,117 --> 01:42:55,230
and there on that device,

2532
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:58,260
but by combining all the known details of human faces

2533
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:00,030
to accurately capture

2534
01:43:00,030 --> 01:43:02,610
the most accurate representation of that.

2535
01:43:02,610 --> 01:43:03,960
So that's the data problem.

2536
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,224
There's a lot of other problems with computer graphics.

2537
01:43:06,224 --> 01:43:08,550
You know, there's technology for rendering hair,

2538
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:10,770
which is really hard 'cause you can't render every, again,

2539
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:11,820
we know the laws of physics,

2540
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:13,410
it would be easy to just render every hair.

2541
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:16,110
It would just be a billion times too slow.

2542
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:18,570
So you need approximations that capture the net effect

2543
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:21,270
of hair on rendering and on pixels

2544
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:24,120
without calculating every single interaction

2545
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:26,730
of every light with every strand of hair.

2546
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:27,563
That's one part of it.

2547
01:43:27,563 --> 01:43:30,180
There's detailed features for different parts of faces.

2548
01:43:30,180 --> 01:43:31,320
There's subsurface scattering

2549
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:33,900
because we think of humans as opaque,

2550
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:37,020
but really our skin is light travels through it,

2551
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,370
it's not completely opaque.

2552
01:43:38,370 --> 01:43:40,260
And the way in which light travels through skin

2553
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,484
has a huge impact on her appearance.

2554
01:43:42,484 --> 01:43:43,920
You know, this is why there's no way you can paint

2555
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,900
a mannequin to look realistic for a human.

2556
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:48,640
You know, it's just a solid surface

2557
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,720
and we'll never have the sort of detail you see.

2558
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:54,333
- We should actually just linger on that.

2559
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:57,810
That kind of blew my mind like thinking through that.

2560
01:43:57,810 --> 01:44:01,740
I think I heard that sort of the oiliness of the skin

2561
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:05,250
creates very specific nuanced,

2562
01:44:05,250 --> 01:44:10,080
complex reflections and then some light is absorbed

2563
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,810
and travels through the skin and that creates,

2564
01:44:12,810 --> 01:44:15,300
would it be fair to say like micro shadows or something?

2565
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:18,630
It creates like textures that our human eyes able

2566
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:20,340
to perceive and it creates the thing

2567
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:23,597
that we consider human, whatever that is.

2568
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:26,760
And so like you have to compute both that, the reflection,

2569
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,660
how light interacts with the oiliness of the skin

2570
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:32,427
and how it is also absorbed in

2571
01:44:32,427 --> 01:44:36,810
and all of that while considering all the muscles

2572
01:44:36,810 --> 01:44:39,150
involved in making the nuance expression.

2573
01:44:39,150 --> 01:44:42,420
Just the subtle squinting of the eyes

2574
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,820
or the subtle formation of a smile.

2575
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,994
It's a stupid annoying subtlety of human faces

2576
01:44:47,994 --> 01:44:49,080
that you have to capture.

2577
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:52,050
Like the difference between a real smile and a fake smile.

2578
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:53,370
Man, I love human faces.

2579
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,600
I love humans in general.

2580
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:59,010
But the way to show like beginning of a formation of a smile

2581
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:02,160
that actually reveals a deep sadness, all of that.

2582
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,143
Like when I watch a human face, I can like read that.

2583
01:45:05,143 --> 01:45:06,540
I could see that.

2584
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:09,540
Again, this is the engineering and the artist.

2585
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,490
You have to have the tools

2586
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:14,550
that in real time can render something like that.

2587
01:45:14,550 --> 01:45:17,280
And that's incredibly difficult. But anyway, sorry.

2588
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,160
So yeah, so there's a lot of this kind of complexity

2589
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:23,130
in even just the lighting of a face.

2590
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:25,620
- That's right, getting faces right requires the interplay

2591
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:27,450
of literally dozens of different systems

2592
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:28,980
and aspects of computer graphics.

2593
01:45:28,980 --> 01:45:31,530
And if any one of them is wrong,

2594
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,620
your eye is completely drawn to that

2595
01:45:34,620 --> 01:45:37,800
and you find it on the wrong side of uncanny valley.

2596
01:45:37,800 --> 01:45:41,250
So the level of perfection needed in this area is vastly,

2597
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:45,030
vastly higher than, you know, world rendering or grass

2598
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:47,023
or any of these other things.

2599
01:45:47,023 --> 01:45:51,180
You know, if the shadows on a work of architecture

2600
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,320
are slightly wrong,

2601
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,690
you're pretty forgiving with that actually.

2602
01:45:54,690 --> 01:45:56,730
Your brain doesn't really care that much.

2603
01:45:56,730 --> 01:45:58,530
But if anything wrong with the human

2604
01:46:00,511 --> 01:46:01,560
it's totally jarring.

2605
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:04,650
- Can you speak more to the creation of digital humans

2606
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:06,780
with MetaHuman, both on the editor side

2607
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:08,630
and sort of bringing it to life side?

2608
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:11,520
It seems like, 'cause I've watched a bunch of videos,

2609
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,360
a bunch of individual developers doing it,

2610
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,930
it's not too difficult to bring a human to life

2611
01:46:18,930 --> 01:46:20,100
using the tooling

2612
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:24,780
that Unreal Engine editor provides.

2613
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:26,610
- There are two main tools.

2614
01:46:26,610 --> 01:46:28,290
You know, compared to the old days

2615
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:30,060
where every face was created by hand

2616
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,310
by an artist from scratch.

2617
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:35,520
One is a MetaHuman Creator tool for creating faces

2618
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,280
where you have a huge number of parameters you can adjust

2619
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,140
to create a unique human

2620
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:42,267
by adjusting all the different capabilities of them.

2621
01:46:42,267 --> 01:46:44,820
And you can then get that MetaHuman Creator

2622
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:45,690
into Unreal Engine,

2623
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:48,700
and then you can add all kinds of computer graphics features

2624
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,690
they're in the engine.

2625
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:54,510
You could add clothing using the cloth simulation system

2626
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:55,770
and you can adjust the hair

2627
01:46:55,770 --> 01:46:59,400
and all these other parameters on the thing.

2628
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,020
And then there's Metahuman Animator,

2629
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:04,470
a tool for animating a human based on a facial capture,

2630
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:07,650
which can be done on a device as simple as like an iPhone.

2631
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:11,280
And transfers the captured animation to the human you want,

2632
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:12,630
which is not straightforward.

2633
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,850
If the actor has one face shape

2634
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:16,890
and the character on screen has another face shape,

2635
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,330
the translation that needs to be done

2636
01:47:18,330 --> 01:47:19,380
from the actor to the face

2637
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:21,330
is actually really sophisticated and non-obvious.

2638
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:23,310
And if you just applied it literally,

2639
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:27,060
then it would be completely wrong from your point of view.

2640
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:29,640
So those are the main tools that people are using now.

2641
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,380
And then when within the Unreal Engine,

2642
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:32,730
then you have a face and you can do

2643
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:34,740
absolutely anything you want to it.

2644
01:47:34,740 --> 01:47:37,350
And you could also, you know, if you decide to go outside

2645
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:39,090
of the Metahuman geometry pipeline,

2646
01:47:39,090 --> 01:47:41,640
you could build your own face, like, you know, any creature

2647
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:44,943
of any sort, and then use the animation tools to animate it.

2648
01:47:45,840 --> 01:47:47,970
But, you know, this is 30 years into a project

2649
01:47:47,970 --> 01:47:50,340
that's probably like 50 years in total

2650
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:51,990
to get to absolute photo realism

2651
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:54,060
and controllability for absolutely everything.

2652
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:55,950
So there's vast amounts of work still to do.

2653
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:58,710
And you know, we don't feel like we've solved

2654
01:47:58,710 --> 01:47:59,543
the problem at all.

2655
01:47:59,543 --> 01:48:02,400
We've just given artists a big productivity multiplier

2656
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:03,660
and a quality multiplier.

2657
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:07,170
But this is not in a state that we would say is done.

2658
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:08,280
- But nevertheless,

2659
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:10,290
I've seen people use it really effectively.

2660
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:13,050
I saw it almost like plugins, maybe external services

2661
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,660
where you can get the faces

2662
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:18,600
to approximate the mouth movements

2663
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:20,700
required to speak a thing.

2664
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:24,510
So like that's a really useful feature.

2665
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:25,830
- Yeah, that's right.

2666
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:28,290
When you have an artist or actor in your studio

2667
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:29,730
and you're recording a specific performance,

2668
01:48:29,730 --> 01:48:31,830
you can just capture their facial motion and apply it.

2669
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:34,170
But if all you have is a voice recording

2670
01:48:34,170 --> 01:48:37,410
or you're generating a voice recording or it's parametric

2671
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:39,030
or procedural or AI generated,

2672
01:48:39,030 --> 01:48:42,570
yeah, then you need the system to translate that speech,

2673
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:44,790
not only to movement of the mouth and lips,

2674
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:46,320
but also to facial expressions

2675
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,153
and the whole intent.

2676
01:48:47,153 --> 01:48:47,986
You know, when we're speaking,

2677
01:48:47,986 --> 01:48:49,290
it's our whole face that's active

2678
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:51,270
and emoting in different ways

2679
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:55,200
and it's not just a mechanical motion of the pieces.

2680
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:59,070
- So we spoke a bit about Nanite, so the magic behind

2681
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:01,140
the virtualized geometry system.

2682
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:03,870
But can you speak a little bit to Lumen

2683
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,070
and in general what it takes

2684
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:08,160
to dynamically light in all the complicated ways,

2685
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,170
the faces, the scenes that we discussed?

2686
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:13,140
Like what are some interesting things to you

2687
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:15,390
that made the magic of it happen?

2688
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:17,850
- Lumen is a system for global illumination.

2689
01:49:17,850 --> 01:49:21,270
Being, it's supposed to calculate the interaction of light

2690
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:25,650
with the entire scene in a way that mimics reality.

2691
01:49:25,650 --> 01:49:28,950
The first generation of engines that did lighting just said,

2692
01:49:28,950 --> 01:49:30,390
well, the light casts light

2693
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:31,980
and the surfaces that hits are lit

2694
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,710
and the surfaces that doesn't directly hit are dark.

2695
01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:37,290
And that's just all the techniques we have.

2696
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:40,410
So you'd have an area that wasn't hit by any light

2697
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:41,550
being completely black,

2698
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:43,110
but in reality, light bounces

2699
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:45,660
around the entire scene dynamically.

2700
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:47,610
When a light hits a red wall,

2701
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:52,110
then most of the blue and green light is absorbed,

2702
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:53,580
but the red light reflects off

2703
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:54,960
and now is hitting other things.

2704
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:57,480
And so if you have a red wall with a white floor,

2705
01:49:57,480 --> 01:50:00,060
light is bouncing off of the red wall into the floor,

2706
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:02,820
and now the floor is being turned red.

2707
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:06,030
And so the entire bouncing of light around the scene

2708
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:08,280
through multiple bounces is the critical challenge

2709
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:09,360
to solve here.

2710
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,340
And again, laws of physics are known.

2711
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:14,100
And so the complete solution to this,

2712
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:16,653
it was written down in the 1950s, I think.

2713
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:21,150
The real magic here in Lumen is this system

2714
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:23,130
that Daniel Wright developed over the course

2715
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:25,350
of many years based on ideas formed

2716
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:27,090
over a longer period of time

2717
01:50:27,090 --> 01:50:28,650
to calculate the way lighting bounces

2718
01:50:28,650 --> 01:50:32,430
around at different scales, ranging from, you know,

2719
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:34,350
the scale of miles or kilometers,

2720
01:50:34,350 --> 01:50:37,443
down to the scale of pixels and millimeters.

2721
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:40,650
And to not only calculated at each level,

2722
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:42,700
but integrate it seamlessly at each level

2723
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:44,850
to give the appearance

2724
01:50:44,850 --> 01:50:47,220
of completely seamless and accurate lighting.

2725
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:50,100
And previous techniques were highly specialized

2726
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:51,810
and artist had to make a decision for each light

2727
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:53,110
about exactly what it did.

2728
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:56,690
And a lot of the practice with Nanite now

2729
01:50:56,690 --> 01:50:57,780
is you build a scene, you place lights in it,

2730
01:50:57,780 --> 01:51:01,710
and it just works to make it that much easier.

2731
01:51:01,710 --> 01:51:04,500
- Yeah, I mean, we're watching, so I recommend people go

2732
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:08,010
through this blog post, like, look at that so dynamically.

2733
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:09,110
I mean, we should say that,

2734
01:51:09,110 --> 01:51:10,920
so there's the indoors and the outdoors,

2735
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:13,920
and to be able to dynamically compute the impact

2736
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,850
of outdoor light.

2737
01:51:14,850 --> 01:51:16,737
Just look at that.

2738
01:51:16,737 --> 01:51:18,780
Look how gorgeous that is.

2739
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:20,580
Just the lighting, like,

2740
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,133
we're looking now at an image of a cave.

2741
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,430
So external light lighting

2742
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:29,583
the intricate complexity of insides of a cave.

2743
01:51:30,667 --> 01:51:31,500
Look at that.

2744
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,690
- Light in the real world goes through a lot of bounces

2745
01:51:33,690 --> 01:51:35,670
and the effect of it are very, very subtle.

2746
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:37,770
But when they're not there, you miss them.

2747
01:51:38,670 --> 01:51:41,010
Often a person can't point out why a scene is wrong,

2748
01:51:41,010 --> 01:51:42,090
but they know it looks wrong.

2749
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:44,040
And it's the lack of the subtle lighting cues

2750
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,330
that we're seeing here.

2751
01:51:45,330 --> 01:51:46,860
- And you know, for great,

2752
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:48,390
'cause we mentioned for great video games,

2753
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:52,440
but also for great films, lighting can make a film

2754
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,520
and we're just looking at sort

2755
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,250
of a very dramatic lighting of a scene.

2756
01:51:56,250 --> 01:51:59,010
Like imagine stepping into the scene,

2757
01:51:59,010 --> 01:52:01,170
it's exciting, it's terrifying.

2758
01:52:01,170 --> 01:52:03,450
And all of that has to do with light,

2759
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:07,290
the interplay between light and darkness.

2760
01:52:07,290 --> 01:52:09,810
It's incredible, it's really, truly, truly incredible.

2761
01:52:09,810 --> 01:52:12,150
Like light is everything, and then to put the power

2762
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:14,700
of the tooling in the hands of an artist

2763
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:16,320
that is really special.

2764
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:19,280
- Yeah, the industry's gone through a massive evolution

2765
01:52:19,280 --> 01:52:23,100
and there's so many supporting systems to make this awesome.

2766
01:52:23,100 --> 01:52:24,710
And always artists.

2767
01:52:24,710 --> 01:52:25,710
(Lex laughing)

2768
01:52:25,710 --> 01:52:29,820
- We're looking at reflections on smooth surfaces.

2769
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:34,820
Oh boy, oh boy, look at how gorgeous that is.

2770
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:36,600
- Yeah, that's right. - Wow.

2771
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:37,710
- And you have to appreciate,

2772
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,810
the algorithms are doing quite a lot here.

2773
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,690
You can have a, you know, a scene with a huge number

2774
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:44,910
of not just lights, but also bright objects

2775
01:52:44,910 --> 01:52:47,070
that reflect light off of them.

2776
01:52:47,070 --> 01:52:49,140
Every one of those has to be captured in the reflections

2777
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:50,616
in order for it to be realistic.

2778
01:52:50,616 --> 01:52:52,680
And, you know, you can't calculate

2779
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:54,087
every photon in the scene,

2780
01:52:54,087 --> 01:52:57,000
and so you need really detailed approximations.

2781
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,320
And that's the field of computer graphics.

2782
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,290
It's about increasingly effective approximations

2783
01:53:01,290 --> 01:53:04,530
of the laws of physics, which are just totally intractable.

2784
01:53:04,530 --> 01:53:06,840
- But the result of that graphics is the feelings

2785
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,580
and experience by the viewer.

2786
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:11,830
And it's just to me, as a fan of,

2787
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:14,070
well, let's say beauty in the world,

2788
01:53:14,070 --> 01:53:16,350
it's exciting that we can create

2789
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:20,400
that synthetically, artificially via graphics

2790
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,830
and that just, it blows wide open

2791
01:53:22,830 --> 01:53:24,990
the possibilities of storytelling.

2792
01:53:24,990 --> 01:53:26,550
So outside of video games,

2793
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:28,590
a lot of people are using Unreal Engine

2794
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:30,693
for movies, for films.

2795
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,480
And big congrats, I saw "Wars is Over" short film

2796
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:39,060
that was made with Unreal Engine won an Oscar.

2797
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:42,720
So you can add that to the resume. (laughs)

2798
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,640
So that's huge, you know,

2799
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:48,090
an Oscar winning film made with Unreal Engine.

2800
01:53:48,090 --> 01:53:50,230
So what do you see as the future of

2801
01:53:51,994 --> 01:53:53,820
the use of Unreal Engine

2802
01:53:53,820 --> 01:53:56,253
and creating stories in the film industry?

2803
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:59,940
- Increasing capabilities and productivity.

2804
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:00,990
You know, the limiting factor

2805
01:54:00,990 --> 01:54:04,563
in every one of these businesses is cost.

2806
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:08,850
And the more the engine can make their jobs easier,

2807
01:54:08,850 --> 01:54:11,130
the more power that brings them.

2808
01:54:11,130 --> 01:54:13,020
One of the big revolutions we've seen in Hollywood

2809
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:17,280
is that moving away from doing computer graphics integration

2810
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,610
into a human scene with green screens,

2811
01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:24,090
to moving to these large LED wall panels,

2812
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:25,920
they're displaying real-time computer graphics

2813
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,370
powered by the Unreal Engine.

2814
01:54:28,378 --> 01:54:29,880
And that's a massive improvement in quality.

2815
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,800
You can recognize the old green screen movies

2816
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:35,040
because the lighting on the characters is just wrong.

2817
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,140
And you know, as much as they try to fix it up,

2818
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:38,280
it never really works.

2819
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:40,293
When you're filming in front of a LED panel

2820
01:54:40,293 --> 01:54:43,050
with LED light emitters in front of you as well,

2821
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:45,420
the actor not only picks up all the lighting

2822
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:47,190
from the actual natural scene that they're supposed

2823
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:49,710
to appear in the movie, but they also can look around

2824
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:51,090
and see it, and they're aware of exactly

2825
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:52,950
what set they're acting in.

2826
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:55,620
And just the overall end result is that much higher.

2827
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,450
It's as much because the actors are able

2828
01:54:57,450 --> 01:55:00,330
to do their jobs better seeing the scene they're in

2829
01:55:00,330 --> 01:55:02,400
because the technology is enabling

2830
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,770
a better lighting calculation

2831
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:06,207
and a better interplay of virtual light

2832
01:55:06,207 --> 01:55:09,420
and real world light to make the end result awesome.

2833
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:12,960
- So there's a lot of excitement around generative AI.

2834
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,970
What do you think is the future of the interplay

2835
01:55:14,970 --> 01:55:18,660
between what a human artist creates

2836
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:22,950
and what an AI system can create in Unreal Engine?

2837
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:25,200
- I think a lot of people in the industry

2838
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,290
are overly optimistic about the rate of progress of AI

2839
01:55:28,290 --> 01:55:30,240
for video and other things like that.

2840
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,890
The real problem is consistency,

2841
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:33,930
like spurting out an image is really high quality,

2842
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:37,020
but with video over the course of seeing, you know,

2843
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:40,080
all the AI approaches have consistency issues

2844
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:41,190
going from one place to another.

2845
01:55:41,190 --> 01:55:43,673
And I don't think that those will just be remedied.

2846
01:55:44,910 --> 01:55:49,910
Fundamentally AI just doesn't have anything resembling

2847
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:52,290
an understanding of the entire scene they're in,

2848
01:55:52,290 --> 01:55:55,680
the entire arc of the movie or plot therein

2849
01:55:55,680 --> 01:55:57,943
and the entirety of the world around them

2850
01:55:57,943 --> 01:56:00,780
and how it might affect a scene.

2851
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:02,280
Whereas game engines have that

2852
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:05,397
exactly where they need to be.

2853
01:56:05,397 --> 01:56:07,290
And so I think what we're gonna see

2854
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:10,410
in the space of world-class high quality productions

2855
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:12,510
isn't just everybody moves to AI

2856
01:56:12,510 --> 01:56:16,620
and a large part of the human creatives contributing

2857
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:17,610
to that are obsolete.

2858
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:19,470
I think what we're gonna see is AI becoming

2859
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,530
a multiplying force on the power of human creatives,

2860
01:56:22,530 --> 01:56:25,390
making them able to create better stuff more quickly

2861
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:28,260
and with higher quality end results.

2862
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:31,650
And I think unlike the fields of generative 2D art

2863
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:35,550
and generative text, I think the future of AI

2864
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:38,157
is much more complex and nuanced.

2865
01:56:38,157 --> 01:56:40,230
And I think your interview with Mark Zuckerberg

2866
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:42,180
conducted in VR was a really

2867
01:56:42,180 --> 01:56:43,833
good first example of this.

2868
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:48,990
So you did this VR discussion, it was capturing your faces

2869
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:51,510
and then rendering a completely 3D

2870
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:53,970
computer graphics model of your faces.

2871
01:56:53,970 --> 01:56:56,250
And then the end result was patched up

2872
01:56:56,250 --> 01:57:00,030
by an AI image enhancer that was able to add

2873
01:57:00,030 --> 01:57:02,130
an awful lot of the missing subtleties that are lost

2874
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:04,560
by normal computer graphics rendering.

2875
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:05,794
And that's the first step.

2876
01:57:05,794 --> 01:57:08,970
You know, you can imagine the output of Unreal Engine

2877
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:12,390
being enhanced by an AI pixel shading post processor

2878
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:13,440
is one thing.

2879
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,310
You can imagine creation of objects being enhanced

2880
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:19,680
and especially mashing up high quality objects

2881
01:57:19,680 --> 01:57:20,880
that have already been created.

2882
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:23,640
Like Epic's Quixel team went around the world

2883
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:26,310
and scanned tens of thousands of real world objects

2884
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:27,930
at extremely high levels of quality.

2885
01:57:27,930 --> 01:57:30,270
They have everything from rocks to trees

2886
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:33,690
to archeological finds and so on.

2887
01:57:33,690 --> 01:57:34,830
All captured there.

2888
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:36,330
And we have an awesome library of them

2889
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:38,370
on the Fab content site.

2890
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:39,660
What it's missing is the ability

2891
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:41,700
to create arbitrary amounts of new content.

2892
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:45,330
And you know, I think using data like that

2893
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:47,910
and AI to create completely new trees

2894
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:50,040
that meet your specification from all of the knowledge

2895
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,960
that has built up of high quality scanned trees

2896
01:57:51,960 --> 01:57:53,760
is gonna be a really valuable thing.

2897
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:58,140
But you know, I don't see this reducing the need

2898
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,940
for people or the role of people,

2899
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:03,060
rather, I think it actually is probably an enhancer on that.

2900
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:05,160
I can't help but think when I go on Amazon

2901
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:06,540
and Netflix to watch a movie,

2902
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:08,850
there's awful lot of linear content

2903
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:10,360
and most of it isn't very good

2904
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:14,610
because you know of the limitations of the media

2905
01:58:14,610 --> 01:58:16,830
and the budgets and of other things.

2906
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:18,600
If we can use AI as an enhancer on that,

2907
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,300
then, you know, everybody's gonna have

2908
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,860
even more opportunity than they have now.

2909
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:26,070
And every single technological revolution

2910
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:27,480
has changed the way that people work,

2911
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:30,300
but it's ultimately created more opportunity for people.

2912
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:33,060
And you know, the (indistinct) its predicting

2913
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:34,450
that this might be the last,

2914
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:35,283
but I think just the opposite.

2915
01:58:35,283 --> 01:58:36,310
I'm an optimist on this

2916
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:38,220
and an optimist that it's going

2917
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:40,350
to create opportunity for everyone.

2918
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:44,070
- Do you think it would be possible to generate,

2919
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:48,340
so use generative AI to create

2920
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,990
dynamic objects like you mentioned trees

2921
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:55,590
in the Unreal Engine world, so create meshes and textures

2922
01:58:55,590 --> 01:58:58,620
and empower the creator

2923
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:02,250
to create faster use meta knobs,

2924
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:05,040
like hyper parameters versus very nuanced

2925
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:08,580
where you can control much faster the look of a face,

2926
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:10,650
the look of a tree, all that kind of stuff.

2927
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:12,300
- Yeah, I think that's the central challenge

2928
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:15,750
of the next decade of game engines and AI for,

2929
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:17,750
you know, content creation of all sorts.

2930
01:59:18,630 --> 01:59:20,940
Because you have two very different models of the world

2931
01:59:20,940 --> 01:59:22,050
that are emerging.

2932
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:24,960
There's the scene graph, the technical term we use

2933
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,153
to describe the set of all of the objects in the world

2934
01:59:27,153 --> 01:59:29,670
in a 3D world maintained by Unreal Engine

2935
01:59:29,670 --> 01:59:32,010
or another engine, you know,

2936
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:35,100
so in the videos you saw, it's the rocks and the trees

2937
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,660
and the snow and the bridge

2938
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:37,947
and the people and all of these things.

2939
01:59:37,947 --> 01:59:41,340
And each one has enormous amounts of data attached to it.

2940
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:44,610
Some are like texture maps, some are sound files,

2941
01:59:44,610 --> 01:59:46,180
some are animation files

2942
01:59:47,130 --> 01:59:49,800
and enormous amounts of detail all stored there

2943
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:51,090
in that procedural,

2944
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:53,880
in this precise computer graphics representation

2945
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:55,770
that enables rendering it from any perspective

2946
01:59:55,770 --> 01:59:57,017
with any settings and so on.

2947
01:59:57,017 --> 01:59:59,730
It's a completely general system

2948
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:02,010
that has complete context

2949
02:00:02,010 --> 02:00:03,480
about the state of the world at any point.

2950
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:05,250
And so you can always precisely reproduce it.

2951
02:00:05,250 --> 02:00:07,050
If you play the same scene 10 times in a row,

2952
02:00:07,050 --> 02:00:08,340
it's always the same.

2953
02:00:08,340 --> 02:00:09,540
It's never randomly changing.

2954
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:10,563
You're like, "Oh no, why did it

2955
02:00:10,563 --> 02:00:13,167
that this character's face change midstream?"

2956
02:00:14,070 --> 02:00:15,630
But it's also, you know, rather limited

2957
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:17,337
because you have to build everything manually

2958
02:00:17,337 --> 02:00:19,260
and it's costly and it's time consuming.

2959
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:20,730
It requires expertise.

2960
02:00:20,730 --> 02:00:22,290
And then you have this other model of the world,

2961
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:24,450
which is what AI sees or thinks.

2962
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:26,960
You know, if we could peer into what's really happening

2963
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:27,930
in its parameters,

2964
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:31,110
there's something like the mushy connections of neurons

2965
02:00:31,110 --> 02:00:32,700
in a brain.

2966
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:36,570
It has a vast amount of knowledge about the world

2967
02:00:36,570 --> 02:00:39,660
and about graphics and about images and about people

2968
02:00:39,660 --> 02:00:40,920
and about everything else.

2969
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:44,430
It's stored in a human incomprehensible form,

2970
02:00:44,430 --> 02:00:46,560
but it can be extracted through queries

2971
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,510
like asking it to produce an image from a prompt

2972
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:50,820
or a video from a prompt or whoever.

2973
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:55,470
But the huge problem with that is it's very mushy data.

2974
02:00:55,470 --> 02:00:58,680
We don't know how to give it a command

2975
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:00,780
that will give us a precise result.

2976
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:02,547
And if it produces one image one time

2977
02:01:02,547 --> 02:01:04,080
and we change our prompt slightly,

2978
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,490
it might produce something completely different

2979
02:01:05,490 --> 02:01:07,290
and we were unable to art direct it.

2980
02:01:08,230 --> 02:01:10,650
And so it's this completely untamed tool.

2981
02:01:10,650 --> 02:01:13,350
And I think, you know, when we figure out more

2982
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,970
and more ways to merge these

2983
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:16,470
and connect these two together,

2984
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:20,580
you can imagine AI enhancing the process of content creation

2985
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:23,250
in a traditional scene representation.

2986
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:25,950
You can re imagine the scene representation

2987
02:01:25,950 --> 02:01:26,970
being cured with AI.

2988
02:01:26,970 --> 02:01:28,680
So the AI not only sees a prompt,

2989
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:31,402
but also here's a list of all of the objects in the world

2990
02:01:31,402 --> 02:01:32,370
and the characteristics and so on.

2991
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:33,990
It can learn more about how those objects

2992
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:35,460
should move and interact.

2993
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,380
And so if you get a constant feedback cycle

2994
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:39,990
going back and forth between an engine and AI,

2995
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:42,000
and I think you can get the best of both worlds,

2996
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,760
stable scenes, but also the higher productivity

2997
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:47,040
of being able to get content out

2998
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,530
and the ability to like select specific parts of it

2999
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:50,793
and art direct those.

3000
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:53,580
And to have those art directions stick

3001
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:54,660
and be recognized

3002
02:01:54,660 --> 02:01:57,030
as part of this permanent scene representation.

3003
02:01:57,030 --> 02:01:59,323
- Yeah, I can't wait until AI can operate

3004
02:01:59,323 --> 02:02:01,170
not in the space of pixels,

3005
02:02:01,170 --> 02:02:03,510
but in the space of scene graphs.

3006
02:02:03,510 --> 02:02:05,910
Creating objects in the scene graph,

3007
02:02:05,910 --> 02:02:07,590
whether it's like you mentioned audio

3008
02:02:07,590 --> 02:02:10,830
or any of the things that you mentioned about

3009
02:02:10,830 --> 02:02:12,543
that empower the creator.

3010
02:02:13,950 --> 02:02:16,650
Yeah, that's a super exciting future.

3011
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:19,140
I wonder if you could speak to a fear

3012
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:23,820
that people have on this topic of artists,

3013
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:27,720
engineers fear losing their jobs,

3014
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:30,090
being replaced by AI.

3015
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:32,880
Are there words of hope that you could offer them?

3016
02:02:32,880 --> 02:02:35,160
- This is certainly the most extreme example of it

3017
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:38,040
because AI is just so far ahead of prior technologies,

3018
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,653
but similar fears were had in every other industry.

3019
02:02:41,550 --> 02:02:45,720
There's a fear that digital music synthesis

3020
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:47,370
would obsolete musicians.

3021
02:02:47,370 --> 02:02:50,040
And there's a very brief period of time

3022
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:52,590
in which songs with digital music instruments,

3023
02:02:52,590 --> 02:02:54,210
like there are early mini mugs

3024
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:56,460
and Yamaha synthesizers weren't allowed

3025
02:02:56,460 --> 02:02:58,350
to win certain music industry awards

3026
02:02:58,350 --> 02:03:01,140
because they weren't considered real music.

3027
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:03,000
And then, you know, over time the people were educated

3028
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:04,650
and realized, oh,

3029
02:03:04,650 --> 02:03:06,150
these are just instruments people are playing

3030
02:03:06,150 --> 02:03:09,270
and they're controlling them the same way they did before.

3031
02:03:09,270 --> 02:03:11,460
There's similar questions about is, you know,

3032
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:14,493
computer art built in Photoshop really art,

3033
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:17,795
or is it just, you know, goofy computer stuff?

3034
02:03:17,795 --> 02:03:19,500
And you know, I think nowadays digital artists

3035
02:03:19,500 --> 02:03:22,020
have gained respect and I think, you know,

3036
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:24,420
if you look at just the tools that existed in Photoshop,

3037
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:26,520
some of them are pretty sophisticated

3038
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:27,990
and nowadays AI features,

3039
02:03:27,990 --> 02:03:30,290
but I think AI is ultimately gonna be another tool

3040
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:32,490
in the artist's tool set.

3041
02:03:32,490 --> 02:03:34,140
And you know, I think it's gonna become

3042
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:35,490
a more powerful directable

3043
02:03:35,490 --> 02:03:37,857
and human serving tool in the future.

3044
02:03:37,857 --> 02:03:41,460
And I think a lot of the alienation comes from the prompt

3045
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:43,410
either being immensely powerful

3046
02:03:43,410 --> 02:03:45,120
at giving you an entire creation,

3047
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:47,430
but then being completely unwilling

3048
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:49,800
to let you control the nuances of it.

3049
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:50,850
That feels alienating.

3050
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:53,403
You give it an image, but you're like, you know,

3051
02:03:55,170 --> 02:03:56,760
replace this part of it with this thing

3052
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:57,870
or make that object green.

3053
02:03:57,870 --> 02:03:59,670
And it just like, it can't do it.

3054
02:03:59,670 --> 02:04:02,460
Often it can't be convinced with any number of words

3055
02:04:02,460 --> 02:04:03,718
in the prompt.

3056
02:04:03,718 --> 02:04:05,190
And that makes it feel like the computer's taken

3057
02:04:05,190 --> 02:04:09,240
control away from us, you know, humans and artists

3058
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:11,310
and is refusing to do what we want

3059
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:12,570
and has its own opinions, right?

3060
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:14,190
It feels like a competitor.

3061
02:04:14,190 --> 02:04:17,700
Or I think when we have much, much, much more nuanced

3062
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:19,656
control of it and artists can join and just,

3063
02:04:19,656 --> 02:04:21,060
you know, like, yeah, let's enhance this object,

3064
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:22,080
do this, do that, do that.

3065
02:04:22,080 --> 02:04:23,823
They'll feel it's a, you know, like some of the tools

3066
02:04:23,823 --> 02:04:26,370
that exist in Photoshop, which are in some ways compared

3067
02:04:26,370 --> 02:04:29,370
to a paintbrush or superpowers already,

3068
02:04:29,370 --> 02:04:31,260
AI will come to feel like that too.

3069
02:04:31,260 --> 02:04:33,690
And will increasingly serve creators creating

3070
02:04:33,690 --> 02:04:35,070
and enhancing a work in a way

3071
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:38,310
that feels just a natural extension of their own, you know,

3072
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:40,680
their own bodies and minds.

3073
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:44,010
- And of course there is a real human pain to layoffs

3074
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:46,260
and there is a hype around AI

3075
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:50,520
and then companies might try to implement AI systems

3076
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:54,150
and then so doing layoff a bunch of folks

3077
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:57,450
and the pain that those folks feel is real.

3078
02:04:57,450 --> 02:04:59,910
I think there's always going to be pain

3079
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:01,920
with these kinds of transformation that's happening.

3080
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,900
And it's a terrible pain.

3081
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:06,843
Pain in general in the human experience is terrible,

3082
02:05:07,980 --> 02:05:11,190
but I think I'm personally excited

3083
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:13,830
by the human AI collaboration

3084
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:16,290
as you've described in this whole process.

3085
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:18,390
So I think if you just keep being open

3086
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:19,770
to using the tools,

3087
02:05:19,770 --> 02:05:21,480
constantly trying the cutting edge tools,

3088
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,030
how they can make you more productive,

3089
02:05:24,030 --> 02:05:27,390
how can they empower you as a creator, as an artist

3090
02:05:27,390 --> 02:05:32,130
or as an engineer, I think you're gonna just keep winning.

3091
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:37,050
- Yeah, there's a lot of complicated trends underway

3092
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:38,790
and it can be hard to break them down and distinguish.

3093
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:41,250
And I think a lot of people like the theories

3094
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:43,260
that get the biggest traction on social media

3095
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:45,460
often don't capture the real underlying

3096
02:05:46,380 --> 02:05:48,870
mode of forces at play there.

3097
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:52,230
But yeah, I think AI involved in code production

3098
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:55,590
will probably create a net benefit for the need for humanity

3099
02:05:55,590 --> 02:05:57,210
to be involved in coding.

3100
02:05:57,210 --> 02:05:58,666
It may change parts of jobs,

3101
02:05:58,666 --> 02:06:01,590
but I don't think it's gonna obsolete anybody

3102
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:04,590
who's willing to learn new ways of doing things.

3103
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:05,610
And it's always been this way.

3104
02:06:05,610 --> 02:06:08,460
And I think that there's also a lot of over hype in AI.

3105
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:10,683
AI is really great at spewing out code that does something

3106
02:06:10,683 --> 02:06:13,170
that a million GitHub repositories already do

3107
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:14,003
because it's, you know,

3108
02:06:14,003 --> 02:06:15,840
kind of learned the underlying pattern.

3109
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,870
It's notoriously hard to get to do something new,

3110
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:19,950
it hasn't been done before,

3111
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:21,690
especially when it's a complex task.

3112
02:06:21,690 --> 02:06:25,650
And you know, the bigger amount of code you ask AI for,

3113
02:06:25,650 --> 02:06:26,490
the more it leaves you

3114
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:29,187
with just a massive code that sort of works, right?

3115
02:06:29,187 --> 02:06:32,100
And that's the problem with code it like 99% works,

3116
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:33,300
but the 1%.

3117
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:36,090
Might be harder to get to 100% with AI

3118
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:37,140
than with hand coding.

3119
02:06:37,140 --> 02:06:39,270
And everybody who's looking at this topic should actually

3120
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:41,550
try using the coding assistance on hard problems

3121
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:43,440
and see how they do there.

3122
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:47,310
- Yeah, I think it, for me personally, it makes it more fun

3123
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:50,490
and faster to generate boiler plate code

3124
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:52,260
so I can focus on the harder decisions,

3125
02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:53,907
harder big picture decisions

3126
02:06:53,907 --> 02:06:57,510
and harder innovative decisions and all that kind of stuff.

3127
02:06:57,510 --> 02:06:59,670
And just makes programming more fun for me

3128
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:01,833
because I feel less lonely.

3129
02:07:02,850 --> 02:07:04,050
(Lex laughing)

3130
02:07:04,050 --> 02:07:07,740
I have like, even when it gives the wrong code,

3131
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:11,220
I feel like, oh, okay, well that's a way to do it.

3132
02:07:11,220 --> 02:07:13,973
That's interesting, and then you could talk to it maybe.

3133
02:07:15,541 --> 02:07:18,270
Maybe that shows something about the programming experience

3134
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:20,700
that it is in part sometimes a bit lonely.

3135
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:22,950
- The topic of boiler plate code is an interesting one

3136
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:26,180
because like the mere distance of boiler plate code

3137
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:28,352
is a failure of programming language

3138
02:07:28,352 --> 02:07:31,620
and of the idea of creating software modules, right?

3139
02:07:31,620 --> 02:07:34,260
You know, you ask AI to create a sorting function, great,

3140
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:35,910
now you have another sorting function

3141
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:38,310
that might be buggy alongside the million others

3142
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:39,330
that different people have written.

3143
02:07:39,330 --> 02:07:41,040
It would be better to have a sorting function

3144
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,140
that's been written and tested and optimized

3145
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:44,580
and everybody relies on it.

3146
02:07:44,580 --> 02:07:46,560
And more modular software,

3147
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:50,640
I think will actually reduce the opportunity of AI

3148
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,980
because, you know, people doing programming work

3149
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:54,630
will largely be solving unique problems.

3150
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:56,430
They're actually hard problems in themselves

3151
02:07:56,430 --> 02:07:59,430
and not just connecting other widgets.

3152
02:07:59,430 --> 02:08:01,500
- Yeah, I think as in many cases,

3153
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:04,530
AI will just help improve the human systems

3154
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:06,303
by shining a mirror to ourselves.

3155
02:08:07,590 --> 02:08:10,080
I have to apologize for the pothead question ahead of time,

3156
02:08:10,080 --> 02:08:13,230
but let's talk about the metaverse broadly.

3157
02:08:13,230 --> 02:08:16,590
You've been a big proponent of the idea of the metaverse.

3158
02:08:16,590 --> 02:08:18,570
We'll talk more specifically what that means today,

3159
02:08:18,570 --> 02:08:22,410
but we've been talking about simulating reality

3160
02:08:22,410 --> 02:08:24,162
better and better and better.

3161
02:08:24,162 --> 02:08:25,890
(Lex sighing)

3162
02:08:25,890 --> 02:08:28,080
So the pothead question is, what does it take

3163
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:32,010
to simulate reality to the level

3164
02:08:32,010 --> 02:08:34,680
we see around us today?

3165
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,790
How far away from that are we

3166
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:39,780
to simulate this ultra realistic,

3167
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:44,760
immersive fun reality that earth is?

3168
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:45,750
What does it take?

3169
02:08:45,750 --> 02:08:48,510
- We're going to get shockingly close over the coming years,

3170
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:50,190
certainly less than 20 years.

3171
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:52,110
If you look at the progress, what areas

3172
02:08:52,110 --> 02:08:54,240
where we have achieved total photo realism

3173
02:08:54,240 --> 02:08:56,040
and what areas where we fall short?

3174
02:08:56,040 --> 02:08:58,350
We're getting very close in awe,

3175
02:08:58,350 --> 02:09:00,600
non-human interactions you see in the world,

3176
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:03,720
walking through a jungle or a city,

3177
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:05,580
all the lighting, it's very close.

3178
02:09:05,580 --> 02:09:07,080
And that might be just a few years away,

3179
02:09:07,080 --> 02:09:09,210
but then all of the problems that involve humans,

3180
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:14,130
human dialogue and intent have a much, much, much higher bar

3181
02:09:14,130 --> 02:09:16,170
that they need to meet to satisfy our brains

3182
02:09:16,170 --> 02:09:19,653
and convince us that they're realistic and/or real.

3183
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:23,490
And yeah, I think that's gonna be the primary challenge

3184
02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:24,900
of graphics development

3185
02:09:24,900 --> 02:09:27,480
and simulation development over the coming decade.

3186
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:31,260
- So the realistic humans, that's gonna be the bottom line.

3187
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:35,910
Yeah, so, and visual and behavior too, so everything?

3188
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:38,130
- Yeah, I was asked about this about 10 years ago

3189
02:09:38,130 --> 02:09:41,070
and I said that even if you gave us an infinite amount

3190
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:43,740
of computing power, we couldn't simulate realistic humans

3191
02:09:43,740 --> 02:09:45,810
because we simply don't have the algorithms,

3192
02:09:45,810 --> 02:09:49,530
we have no idea how to simulate human intelligence.

3193
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:51,600
And that was absolutely the case then,

3194
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:53,940
but it's not really true anymore.

3195
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:55,020
You know, what we're seeing

3196
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:58,290
with generative text AI is not only at a level

3197
02:09:58,290 --> 02:10:00,450
that you could say that it's actually doing

3198
02:10:00,450 --> 02:10:03,840
a pretty good job of simulating human, at least humans

3199
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:06,240
at the text level, not at the emotional level yet,

3200
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:09,450
but at least at the level of words spoken and find more

3201
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:12,090
and more ways of training it on more and more scenarios

3202
02:10:12,090 --> 02:10:13,513
that, you know, you might have

3203
02:10:13,513 --> 02:10:16,127
a very, very compelling human simulation going on

3204
02:10:16,127 --> 02:10:19,530
in the next five years even.

3205
02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:20,730
I'm not saying it's a good idea,

3206
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:23,130
but I like think the arc of the technology

3207
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:24,810
is inextricably heading in that way

3208
02:10:24,810 --> 02:10:27,240
and it's heading at a shocking, shocking rate.

3209
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:28,620
- You know, we don't say this enough,

3210
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:31,810
but the current state of LLMs, I mean

3211
02:10:33,240 --> 02:10:37,350
if you put Alan Turing in conversation with ChatGPT,

3212
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:40,140
I mean it really passes the Turing test

3213
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:44,580
like almost definitively passes the Turing test.

3214
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:46,380
Of course we like keep raising the bar.

3215
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,383
Well, the Turing test is not a real test,

3216
02:10:47,383 --> 02:10:49,440
it's not a useful test, whatever.

3217
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:52,590
We just keep raising the bar for AI where it's always going

3218
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:55,140
to be lesser than.

3219
02:10:55,140 --> 02:11:00,000
But yeah, you have increasingly ultra realistic faces

3220
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,020
and bodies combined with increasingly moving

3221
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:09,020
and powerful full of emotion, speech, text.

3222
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:10,350
You know, I work with this amazing company

3223
02:11:10,350 --> 02:11:12,480
called ElevenLabs that does text-to-speech well.

3224
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:13,830
There's companies that specialize

3225
02:11:13,830 --> 02:11:16,770
in bringing text to life, right?

3226
02:11:16,770 --> 02:11:17,820
That's going to increase,

3227
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:19,720
different companies do that very well.

3228
02:11:21,795 --> 02:11:23,190
And then all of a sudden you have

3229
02:11:23,190 --> 02:11:28,140
this synthetically created scene where human is speaking

3230
02:11:28,140 --> 02:11:31,830
and you're moved to the point of tears because of the scene.

3231
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:36,330
Beautifully lit face in the full darkness, the emotion,

3232
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:37,863
the drama of the scene.

3233
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:42,750
Yeah, I think so you're saying five, 10 years maybe 20.

3234
02:11:42,750 --> 02:11:44,190
- Yeah, absolutely.

3235
02:11:44,190 --> 02:11:46,650
We'll definitely see it in our lifetimes.

3236
02:11:46,650 --> 02:11:49,300
- Increasing the level of potheadness in my question.

3237
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:52,623
Do you think we might live in a simulation?

3238
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:56,280
And if we do or don't,

3239
02:11:56,280 --> 02:11:59,040
how hard would it be to build such a simulation

3240
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:03,390
where we're fully convinced we're in it?

3241
02:12:03,390 --> 02:12:04,650
- Well, I don't think

3242
02:12:04,650 --> 02:12:06,720
that these questions are necessarily unanswerable.

3243
02:12:06,720 --> 02:12:09,040
I think I'd like to see more actual effort

3244
02:12:09,915 --> 02:12:11,850
to ascertain like what is the underlying

3245
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:14,070
mechanism of the universe.

3246
02:12:14,070 --> 02:12:16,290
And I don't think we're here for no reason at all.

3247
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:18,180
I think the world's a pretty cool place

3248
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:20,010
and the fact that we can exist

3249
02:12:20,010 --> 02:12:21,600
and, you know, the laws of physics

3250
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:24,630
and especially a standard model of physics

3251
02:12:24,630 --> 02:12:27,210
and all of the parameters that lead to, you know,

3252
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:28,890
these atoms and life evolving

3253
02:12:28,890 --> 02:12:30,990
and the presence of thermodynamic gradients,

3254
02:12:30,990 --> 02:12:33,000
that's really cool.

3255
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,280
And I think it's a worthy field

3256
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,290
to study more about that holistically.

3257
02:12:37,290 --> 02:12:40,560
I dunno, the question of are we living in a simulation

3258
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,630
ourselves always boils down to, well,

3259
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:45,210
if we are living in simulation, what are they living in?

3260
02:12:45,210 --> 02:12:47,910
Because at some point there has to be some base reality.

3261
02:12:47,910 --> 02:12:50,081
Or, you know, one of the philosophical theories

3262
02:12:50,081 --> 02:12:52,290
that was put forth seriously was

3263
02:12:52,290 --> 02:12:55,140
that there is no physical reality.

3264
02:12:55,140 --> 02:12:57,720
If you have a system of equations, you know,

3265
02:12:57,720 --> 02:13:01,560
such as the laws of physics, then all possible evolutions

3266
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:03,720
of dynamical systems under those equations

3267
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:05,340
kind of have a physical reality.

3268
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:07,950
So we just are kind of a manifestation of laws of math

3269
02:13:07,950 --> 02:13:11,670
rather than needing an actual universe around us.

3270
02:13:11,670 --> 02:13:14,340
I dunno, I like dabbling into that philosophy.

3271
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:16,650
And as we see AI becoming smarter and smarter

3272
02:13:16,650 --> 02:13:17,790
and we get closer and closer

3273
02:13:17,790 --> 02:13:20,190
to really capturing the full laws of physics,

3274
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:22,680
these questions become quite a lot more compelling.

3275
02:13:22,680 --> 02:13:23,970
- You know, you start to think,

3276
02:13:23,970 --> 02:13:26,430
if we're not living in a simulation,

3277
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:29,220
what are the things about this reality

3278
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:31,200
that are not simulatable?

3279
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:34,320
So what are the big mysteries around us?

3280
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:36,300
It feels like the physics is simulatable.

3281
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:38,670
It feels like a lot of the incredible stuff

3282
02:13:38,670 --> 02:13:43,670
that we talked about while super nice seems simulatable.

3283
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:47,160
But then there's the flame of consciousness,

3284
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,410
the feeling of it, whatever that is

3285
02:13:49,410 --> 02:13:51,990
that lights up in our eyes as humans.

3286
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:53,700
Maybe that's not simulatable.

3287
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:55,080
Maybe that is the thing.

3288
02:13:55,080 --> 02:13:58,680
Maybe that's a thread that connects to the explanation

3289
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:01,110
of the mechanism, as you said, of the universe

3290
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:02,187
that's really important to understand.

3291
02:14:02,187 --> 02:14:04,737
And we're completely clueless about that mechanism.

3292
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:08,490
I mean, a lot of the religious texts sneak up on

3293
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:12,510
what that mechanism is, but we're still mostly clueless.

3294
02:14:12,510 --> 02:14:14,220
We only have these like leaps of faith

3295
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:15,930
in believing what that mechanism might be.

3296
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:17,010
- So, you know, the whole idea

3297
02:14:17,010 --> 02:14:20,850
of nested simulations perhaps, you know,

3298
02:14:20,850 --> 02:14:24,630
given an sufficiently advanced technology is kind of mooted

3299
02:14:24,630 --> 02:14:27,420
such that if you wanted to simulate another reality,

3300
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:29,940
you're kind of just actually creating the reality.

3301
02:14:29,940 --> 02:14:33,510
You're doing, you know, quantum mechanical operations

3302
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:35,250
that would produce the same result anyway

3303
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:37,050
and you're running them at full performance.

3304
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:40,050
So it's not really a nested simulation,

3305
02:14:40,050 --> 02:14:43,200
it's just another thing that's happening in the universe.

3306
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:44,520
So that would be interesting.

3307
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:47,040
But I think it's ultimately a theological question

3308
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,950
and because it's no longer cool to deal with theology

3309
02:14:49,950 --> 02:14:53,490
as part of science, there's not been much work on that.

3310
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:57,210
You can't publish results on those topics

3311
02:14:57,210 --> 02:14:58,650
in a respected physics journal.

3312
02:14:58,650 --> 02:15:01,590
So I think it's kind of been set aside,

3313
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:03,270
but it's interesting to note that the laws

3314
02:15:03,270 --> 02:15:06,210
of quantum mechanics themselves have a place for, you know,

3315
02:15:06,210 --> 02:15:09,360
god or souls or whatever external source of input you might

3316
02:15:09,360 --> 02:15:11,580
want to attach to such a thing.

3317
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:14,820
And that, you know, that there's this idea

3318
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:18,090
of quantum ways function collapse, that when we, you know,

3319
02:15:18,090 --> 02:15:19,560
look at a quantum system evolving

3320
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:21,870
and perfect super position of many possibilities

3321
02:15:21,870 --> 02:15:23,400
and you go to observe it, you actually just see

3322
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:25,320
a specific possibility.

3323
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:26,760
In the multi-slit experiment,

3324
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:28,320
the light ultimately ends up being observed

3325
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,630
going through one slit or the other.

3326
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:33,300
And that's a place where there's this random number

3327
02:15:33,300 --> 02:15:35,670
being injected into everything around us.

3328
02:15:35,670 --> 02:15:38,130
You know, trillions of trillions of trillions

3329
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:40,620
of times per second and everything we're observing.

3330
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:42,990
And if you want to ex attach some external input,

3331
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:46,080
well there's a place. (Tim and Lex laughing)

3332
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:48,150
- And it could be seriously accessible

3333
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:51,900
to the rigors of science, but we just know so little there.

3334
02:15:51,900 --> 02:15:54,000
- Yeah, it's funny, and in that area,

3335
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,600
we know nothing more than cavemen knew whatsoever.

3336
02:15:57,600 --> 02:15:59,400
We know than the laws of quantum mechanics.

3337
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:02,070
And we have computers that maybe

3338
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:04,500
soon more advanced than we are,

3339
02:16:04,500 --> 02:16:05,760
but we just don't have any answers

3340
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:10,560
to the fundamental questions about life,

3341
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:11,960
the universe and everything.

3342
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,093
- Do you think sort of more practically,

3343
02:16:16,020 --> 02:16:20,590
do you think we'll create video game worlds

3344
02:16:23,265 --> 02:16:26,215
of the metaverse variety in which humans will want to stay?

3345
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:31,410
So I mean, to me, this kind of discussion

3346
02:16:31,410 --> 02:16:34,780
of a simulated reality, the real test of immersion is like

3347
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:38,520
not wanting to go back to the real world.

3348
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:43,520
As a perfectly healthy, excited, normal human being,

3349
02:16:43,830 --> 02:16:45,843
choosing to stay in that world.

3350
02:16:46,830 --> 02:16:48,959
How hard is that, do you think?

3351
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:51,690
- Well, I think the technology is coming

3352
02:16:51,690 --> 02:16:52,830
and then there's a human question

3353
02:16:52,830 --> 02:16:54,930
of should we go that far?

3354
02:16:54,930 --> 02:16:56,277
- [Lex] Should we? Yeah.

3355
02:16:56,277 --> 02:16:58,410
- And certainly as a game developer ourselves,

3356
02:16:58,410 --> 02:16:59,850
Epic doesn't aspire to that.

3357
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:01,505
We make fun games.

3358
02:17:01,505 --> 02:17:03,540
And you know, the ultimate manifestation

3359
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:05,850
that we found is fun games that people play together

3360
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:07,493
to have fun in between, you know, work

3361
02:17:07,493 --> 02:17:10,320
and the other things in their real lives.

3362
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:12,510
But as the simulations get more and more realistic

3363
02:17:12,510 --> 02:17:14,549
and the capabilities become more and more real,

3364
02:17:14,549 --> 02:17:16,770
I think we have to ask ourselves some hard questions

3365
02:17:16,770 --> 02:17:20,665
about how should humanity operate in that space?

3366
02:17:20,665 --> 02:17:21,780
What are the limits that we should go to

3367
02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:23,910
and what are the limits we should set?

3368
02:17:23,910 --> 02:17:27,389
- Yeah, I think there's gonna be some hard questions

3369
02:17:27,389 --> 02:17:32,389
and I think maybe I'm just being human-centric here,

3370
02:17:33,360 --> 02:17:35,660
but there should probably be some legal bounds

3371
02:17:36,983 --> 02:17:38,340
on two things,

3372
02:17:38,340 --> 02:17:40,170
sort of not creating a reality

3373
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:42,959
in which humans would want to stay too long.

3374
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:46,290
Sort of, yeah, focusing more on the game side.

3375
02:17:46,290 --> 02:17:47,823
And more importantly,

3376
02:17:50,850 --> 02:17:55,049
not creating simulations of humans

3377
02:17:55,049 --> 02:17:56,673
that could suffer.

3378
02:17:58,740 --> 02:18:00,750
To me, you know, as we talked about

3379
02:18:00,750 --> 02:18:03,450
creating ultra realistic humans,

3380
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:06,900
eventually that means creating humans that can suffer,

3381
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:10,410
that can fall in love and experience heartbreak and loss.

3382
02:18:10,410 --> 02:18:11,852
It can fear death.

3383
02:18:12,990 --> 02:18:16,190
And the more you simulate that to the full reality

3384
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:19,709
of the human condition, the more you get to this place

3385
02:18:19,709 --> 02:18:21,540
where you have assimilated humans

3386
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:23,760
that is able to suffer.

3387
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:26,670
And I think legally speaking, I think you have to get

3388
02:18:26,670 --> 02:18:29,010
to a place where that's not allowed.

3389
02:18:29,010 --> 02:18:31,173
Like there is a line you can't cross.

3390
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:37,280
And that's a hard thing for humans to deal with.

3391
02:18:37,410 --> 02:18:40,889
That's gonna be some interesting Supreme Court cases.

3392
02:18:40,889 --> 02:18:44,639
Once you create a human sufficiently realistic to

3393
02:18:44,639 --> 02:18:48,820
where they can suffer, means that human could be tortured

3394
02:18:51,081 --> 02:18:54,510
and you know, terrible things to that human

3395
02:18:54,510 --> 02:18:56,430
that's "artificial" quote unquote.

3396
02:18:56,430 --> 02:19:01,430
But boy, that still feels wrong.

3397
02:19:01,620 --> 02:19:02,760
I don't know what that is,

3398
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:03,940
but you feel wrong

3399
02:19:06,389 --> 02:19:08,553
to torture a simulated human.

3400
02:19:10,590 --> 02:19:13,740
Now when you play a video game and it's a shooter

3401
02:19:13,740 --> 02:19:17,250
and everybody's having fun, that doesn't feel wrong,

3402
02:19:17,250 --> 02:19:21,180
but there's a line and that's gonna be a fascinating line

3403
02:19:21,180 --> 02:19:23,820
for the Supreme Court to explore. (laughs)

3404
02:19:23,820 --> 02:19:26,702
Oh man, what an exciting future we're living in, huh?

3405
02:19:28,049 --> 02:19:30,090
- Yeah, you know, I think the thing to appreciate

3406
02:19:30,090 --> 02:19:31,950
is like game developers have just generally

3407
02:19:31,950 --> 02:19:35,070
been on the good spirited side of things.

3408
02:19:35,070 --> 02:19:37,799
If you look at the worst things that people do

3409
02:19:37,799 --> 02:19:40,680
and in popular video games today, it's like what?

3410
02:19:40,680 --> 02:19:41,799
You rob a bank in "GTA."

3411
02:19:41,799 --> 02:19:44,100
Well, it's clearly fictional and awe and fun

3412
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:46,233
and not serious and over the top.

3413
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:50,550
Yeah, I think, yeah, as things get more realistic,

3414
02:19:50,550 --> 02:19:53,310
especially simulation of humans,

3415
02:19:53,310 --> 02:19:54,480
yeah, there are some hard questions

3416
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:55,980
that will have to be answered there.

3417
02:19:55,980 --> 02:19:58,110
But I think the thing that all games developers

3418
02:19:58,110 --> 02:20:01,020
need to remember is we're here to make people's lives better

3419
02:20:01,020 --> 02:20:02,160
by entertaining them,

3420
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:06,090
providing them with fun and a diversion from other things

3421
02:20:06,090 --> 02:20:08,430
and being a part of their lives

3422
02:20:08,430 --> 02:20:13,347
and not trying to be too big or being too much

3423
02:20:13,347 --> 02:20:16,140
and not trying to provide an alternate to reality,

3424
02:20:16,140 --> 02:20:18,660
but to just provide a fun source of entertainment

3425
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:22,140
like the many other things that people do for fun.

3426
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,220
- So you spoken,

3427
02:20:23,220 --> 02:20:26,040
like I mentioned about the metaverse for many years.

3428
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:28,650
Let's step back, what is the metaverse?

3429
02:20:28,650 --> 02:20:33,650
And speaking of fun, you know, "Fortnite," (laughs)

3430
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:37,710
you know, just hundreds of millions of people

3431
02:20:37,710 --> 02:20:42,710
just enjoying themselves in this huge scale social game.

3432
02:20:43,320 --> 02:20:44,520
You could call it a metaverse,

3433
02:20:44,520 --> 02:20:46,740
maybe you can describe the different flavors,

3434
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:50,883
the layers of how you see what the metaverse is.

3435
02:20:52,050 --> 02:20:54,420
- You know, the metaverse is an idea whose stock price

3436
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:57,210
goes up and down depending on who says what

3437
02:20:57,210 --> 02:20:58,043
on what day.

3438
02:20:59,052 --> 02:21:02,880
And some have an ability to drive it way down (laughs)

3439
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:04,800
by opening their mouths.

3440
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:06,200
But ultimately this is about

3441
02:21:07,230 --> 02:21:10,380
multiplayer social gaming experiences.

3442
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:13,830
You and your friends getting together in a 3D world

3443
02:21:13,830 --> 02:21:16,083
and having fun together in any way you want.

3444
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:18,620
You know, if you're playing "Fortnite: Battle Royale,"

3445
02:21:18,620 --> 02:21:21,180
in my view, that is capturing the essence of the metaverse.

3446
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:24,240
And it's, especially in "Fortnite" when we got Sony on board

3447
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:26,820
so that all players on all platforms in "Fortnite"

3448
02:21:26,820 --> 02:21:29,130
could play together, could voice chat together

3449
02:21:29,130 --> 02:21:31,980
and could be part of a single game experience.

3450
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:33,690
It really took on a new nature,

3451
02:21:33,690 --> 02:21:36,870
which was not just like a multiplayer game in, you know,

3452
02:21:36,870 --> 02:21:38,220
with Heritage from "Doom",

3453
02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:40,830
but also a true social experience

3454
02:21:40,830 --> 02:21:42,280
between you and your friends.

3455
02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:44,760
And yeah, "Fortnite: Battle Royal"

3456
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:46,230
is just one manifestation of that.

3457
02:21:46,230 --> 02:21:48,510
Another one is like "Rec Room VR", where you're standing

3458
02:21:48,510 --> 02:21:50,880
around in VR with friends playing billiards

3459
02:21:50,880 --> 02:21:52,290
or shooting hoops and we're doing other

3460
02:21:52,290 --> 02:21:54,210
like light entertainment things.

3461
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:58,020
I think every game that has a huge number of players

3462
02:21:58,020 --> 02:22:00,630
who play together socially as part of their, you know,

3463
02:22:00,630 --> 02:22:02,940
entertainment lives.

3464
02:22:02,940 --> 02:22:06,160
Yeah, I think is really getting at the core essence

3465
02:22:07,079 --> 02:22:09,540
of the, you know, aspiration for the metaverse.

3466
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:12,300
And, you know, we're still in the very early days of it.

3467
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:16,893
You know, I was on the internet and like 1992 or so,

3468
02:22:16,893 --> 02:22:19,380
and you know, it was a pretty bare bones thing.

3469
02:22:19,380 --> 02:22:22,800
I think when we look back at the state of gaming today,

3470
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:25,410
we'll realize that there's a lot further

3471
02:22:25,410 --> 02:22:27,990
to go to get to the ultimate version of it.

3472
02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:29,160
But, you know, I think it's all on track.

3473
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:31,987
And I think it was the time we released

3474
02:22:31,987 --> 02:22:34,680
"Fortnite: Battle Royale" and started playing together,

3475
02:22:34,680 --> 02:22:36,420
all the people at Epic and Squads

3476
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:38,160
and experiencing that world that we realized

3477
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:39,845
that this trend was afoot and that we needed

3478
02:22:39,845 --> 02:22:41,550
to do everything we could

3479
02:22:41,550 --> 02:22:45,270
to bring in other creators so that anybody could, you know,

3480
02:22:45,270 --> 02:22:46,770
pile on to the work we were doing

3481
02:22:46,770 --> 02:22:49,410
by creating their own worlds, you know,

3482
02:22:49,410 --> 02:22:52,241
for through "Fortnite Creative" and UEFN

3483
02:22:52,241 --> 02:22:53,280
and creating more games

3484
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:54,840
and more genres that people could play

3485
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:57,660
and ever expanding the repertoire of fun.

3486
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:59,910
- Yeah, I would love to sort of talk about

3487
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:01,950
different aspects of that a little bit more

3488
02:23:01,950 --> 02:23:04,357
because, you know, Epic has created a lot of amazing games

3489
02:23:04,357 --> 02:23:05,970
"Unreal Tournament", "Gears of War,"

3490
02:23:05,970 --> 02:23:08,100
but the game that I think is fair to say

3491
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:10,587
that transformed the gaming industry was "Fortnite,"

3492
02:23:10,587 --> 02:23:12,750
or "Fortnite: Battle Royale" especially.

3493
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:16,800
Can you explain the origin story of "Fortnite"?

3494
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:19,590
- Well, "Fortnite" has humble beginnings.

3495
02:23:19,590 --> 02:23:24,060
In 2011, we just been in the final days

3496
02:23:24,060 --> 02:23:25,980
of finishing one of the "Gears of War" games

3497
02:23:25,980 --> 02:23:30,930
and we wanted to explore ideas for new games

3498
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:34,470
and we'd had a general idea that we would like to build,

3499
02:23:34,470 --> 02:23:37,350
you know, some smaller games, online games

3500
02:23:37,350 --> 02:23:41,190
or to learn more about, you know, that space

3501
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:44,370
and not just have one single massive game in production

3502
02:23:44,370 --> 02:23:46,410
at all times and only one.

3503
02:23:46,410 --> 02:23:48,600
And so everybody in the company was given a week

3504
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:52,494
to form a team and work with whichever coworkers they wanted

3505
02:23:52,494 --> 02:23:55,260
and build a game, you know, using Unreal Engine

3506
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:56,220
so you can actually build something

3507
02:23:56,220 --> 02:23:57,300
pretty interesting in a week.

3508
02:23:57,300 --> 02:23:59,550
And one of the teams built

3509
02:23:59,550 --> 02:24:01,770
the very first version of what became "Fortnite."

3510
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:04,200
The very first version of it had a different art style,

3511
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:07,110
but it had the idea at the core that you're going

3512
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:09,750
to build forts by day using this building system.

3513
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:10,650
Then night would come

3514
02:24:10,650 --> 02:24:12,780
and you'd defend the forts against zombies.

3515
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:14,100
And you know, the longer you could go,

3516
02:24:14,100 --> 02:24:15,540
the more elaborate forts you could build

3517
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,780
and the more survival, you know, waves you could withstand

3518
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:21,600
and it would get cooler and cooler with time.

3519
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:23,460
And you know, that game was in development

3520
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:25,170
for a very long time.

3521
02:24:25,170 --> 02:24:27,780
We always saw the potential, just the building aspect

3522
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:30,540
of it was incredibly fun.

3523
02:24:30,540 --> 02:24:32,660
But we made different pivots at different times.

3524
02:24:32,660 --> 02:24:33,780
At one point we moved

3525
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:35,190
to the current "Fortnite" art style,

3526
02:24:35,190 --> 02:24:38,100
away from kind of more of a realistic style.

3527
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:41,103
Made it, you know, more in the Pixar vein of, you know,

3528
02:24:42,120 --> 02:24:43,770
cool stylized characters.

3529
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:44,850
- What was that decision like?

3530
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:49,020
'cause you mentioned "Gears of War" is this like incredible,

3531
02:24:49,020 --> 02:24:51,900
like shows off the graphics to the fullest,

3532
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:54,660
different than the artistic style of "Fortnite."

3533
02:24:54,660 --> 02:24:58,230
It's amazing that the same company would make this like fun,

3534
02:24:58,230 --> 02:25:01,320
silly graphic style of "Fortnite," you know.

3535
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:03,330
- People come to Epic because they wanna work

3536
02:25:03,330 --> 02:25:04,620
with the best people in the world

3537
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:06,150
and artists bring a lot of different

3538
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:08,670
personal art aspirations and style capabilities

3539
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:10,320
and many of them are very multi-talented,

3540
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:13,767
can produce photo reel content or highly stylized content.

3541
02:25:13,767 --> 02:25:15,540
And a lot of the best artists on "Fortnite"

3542
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:17,640
were a lot of the best artists on "Gears of War"

3543
02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:19,290
to change styles,

3544
02:25:19,290 --> 02:25:21,660
but continue doing awesome work.

3545
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:23,820
We'd realized that "Fortnite" could be mainstream

3546
02:25:23,820 --> 02:25:25,527
and it could be a game people play for a long time.

3547
02:25:25,527 --> 02:25:28,200
And so having a, you know, more visually pleasing art style

3548
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:31,320
that's, you know, not as stressful as like a "Call of Duty"

3549
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:33,150
game where you're constantly like pixel hunting,

3550
02:25:33,150 --> 02:25:35,310
you know, a dark scene for a, you know,

3551
02:25:35,310 --> 02:25:38,220
somebody's rifle scope. (Tim and Lex laughing)

3552
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:39,990
That was the goal, so, you know, a few of the artists

3553
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:42,120
got through into finding a new art style and we moved to it

3554
02:25:42,120 --> 02:25:44,730
and at different points it evolved towards being

3555
02:25:44,730 --> 02:25:47,250
kind of like a light MMO like "Destiny"

3556
02:25:47,250 --> 02:25:50,670
with rather complex RPG and stat systems.

3557
02:25:50,670 --> 02:25:53,880
And that evolved into a, you know, kind of an UMO like

3558
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:55,830
tower defense game.

3559
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:59,730
UMO only in that persistence of items and stats, you know,

3560
02:25:59,730 --> 02:26:02,343
which became "Fortnite: Save the World" mode,

3561
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:05,007
which we launched in early 2017.

3562
02:26:05,007 --> 02:26:06,780
And it was a moderate success, you know,

3563
02:26:06,780 --> 02:26:09,630
it paid its budget and we'd come out ahead.

3564
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:11,775
And then at the same time

3565
02:26:11,775 --> 02:26:13,027
the "Battle Royale" genre was booming.

3566
02:26:13,027 --> 02:26:14,130
"PubG" had just come out,

3567
02:26:14,130 --> 02:26:15,600
tons of people at Epic were playing that.

3568
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:16,890
They're like, "Oh, this would be so cool

3569
02:26:16,890 --> 02:26:18,600
if it had 'Fortnite' building."

3570
02:26:18,600 --> 02:26:21,630
And so we assembled a team in a war room, you know,

3571
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:24,030
like 30 people in one big room.

3572
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:27,000
And you know, they worked insanely hard for four weeks

3573
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,070
to build "Battle Royale."

3574
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:30,900
So the nice thing is all the content for "Fortnite"

3575
02:26:30,900 --> 02:26:32,810
had been built over the previous seven years.

3576
02:26:32,810 --> 02:26:33,870
They had a huge library of content

3577
02:26:33,870 --> 02:26:35,970
but no gameplay of the type they wanted.

3578
02:26:35,970 --> 02:26:38,250
So they had to build it all in that four weeks and ship it.

3579
02:26:38,250 --> 02:26:41,220
And that put Epic on an exponential growth curve

3580
02:26:41,220 --> 02:26:44,660
where we went from 300 employees to, you know,

3581
02:26:44,660 --> 02:26:45,960
to thousands of employees

3582
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:48,360
and went from about a hundred million dollars in revenue

3583
02:26:48,360 --> 02:26:49,860
to billions of dollars in revenue.

3584
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:53,160
And, you know, kinda became the center of the gaming world

3585
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:54,090
at the time.

3586
02:26:54,090 --> 02:26:56,310
- Can you actually speak to the technical challenge

3587
02:26:56,310 --> 02:27:01,310
of going from mostly not online

3588
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:04,860
large scale gaming platform

3589
02:27:04,860 --> 02:27:08,700
to being able to support with "Battle Royale,"

3590
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:11,100
a huge number of people playing with each other

3591
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:12,450
at the same exact time?

3592
02:27:12,450 --> 02:27:14,220
Like what's the technical four weeks,

3593
02:27:14,220 --> 02:27:15,750
what's the technical challenges

3594
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:17,550
there that had to be overcome?

3595
02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:20,790
- Since 2012, we've been building online backend system

3596
02:27:20,790 --> 02:27:23,400
to support player accounts and login

3597
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:25,080
and you know, all of the different systems there

3598
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:26,490
needed to make a multiplayer game.

3599
02:27:26,490 --> 02:27:29,130
And we've been building them to be scalable.

3600
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:31,650
And by some miracle we built them stably enough

3601
02:27:31,650 --> 02:27:33,810
that they were able to scale up.

3602
02:27:33,810 --> 02:27:35,610
And you know, so the online team was responsible

3603
02:27:35,610 --> 02:27:36,630
for patching that code.

3604
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:39,270
Spent a year of intense work getting it

3605
02:27:39,270 --> 02:27:42,390
to scale from like 40,000 concurrent users

3606
02:27:42,390 --> 02:27:45,810
to 15 million concurrent users.

3607
02:27:45,810 --> 02:27:47,670
Yeah, I mean they're scaling and there scaling,

3608
02:27:47,670 --> 02:27:49,200
that's a lot.

3609
02:27:49,200 --> 02:27:51,720
- That's immense, but they'd done such an awesome job

3610
02:27:51,720 --> 02:27:55,350
of building the foundations that it was tractable,

3611
02:27:55,350 --> 02:27:56,183
it was doable.

3612
02:27:57,090 --> 02:27:58,350
If they hadn't done that,

3613
02:27:58,350 --> 02:28:00,374
then the company would've died that, you know,

3614
02:28:00,374 --> 02:28:01,740
"Fortnite" just wouldn't have been playable

3615
02:28:01,740 --> 02:28:03,840
and the whole thing would've failed.

3616
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:06,630
- I mean there's just so much detail there

3617
02:28:06,630 --> 02:28:08,010
that makes all the difference

3618
02:28:08,010 --> 02:28:11,070
because I mean that's what Spotify has talked about

3619
02:28:11,070 --> 02:28:15,033
that like the latency,

3620
02:28:16,050 --> 02:28:18,820
it's like how quickly you can deliver the song

3621
02:28:20,130 --> 02:28:22,590
changes the product from being this shitty thing

3622
02:28:22,590 --> 02:28:26,070
that I'd rather pirate the songs to like this is good enough

3623
02:28:26,070 --> 02:28:29,501
to where I really enjoy the experience, I want to use it.

3624
02:28:29,501 --> 02:28:32,640
And so like yeah, that's really important

3625
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:37,640
to create an experience for 15 million concurrent users

3626
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:40,860
to where it's not lagging

3627
02:28:40,860 --> 02:28:43,530
or it actually works, right?

3628
02:28:43,530 --> 02:28:47,010
Is there something you could say to the sort of like

3629
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:50,130
how difficult that is to pull off?

3630
02:28:50,130 --> 02:28:51,690
- You know, the trend nowadays

3631
02:28:51,690 --> 02:28:54,270
for building online services is microservices.

3632
02:28:54,270 --> 02:28:57,180
There's not one big server that handles

3633
02:28:57,180 --> 02:28:58,680
all of the interactions with "Fortnite."

3634
02:28:58,680 --> 02:29:02,280
There's game servers running a hundred player game instances

3635
02:29:02,280 --> 02:29:04,080
for each Battle Royale session

3636
02:29:04,080 --> 02:29:06,840
and then there's an account server

3637
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:09,540
and many instances of it all talking to a shared database

3638
02:29:09,540 --> 02:29:11,190
and there's hundreds of different microservices

3639
02:29:11,190 --> 02:29:12,840
talking to each other.

3640
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,640
And so scaling is a matter of identifying

3641
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:16,200
what are the bottlenecks in that system

3642
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:18,900
and making sure that each one can scale

3643
02:29:18,900 --> 02:29:23,553
and has enough redundancy to be able to handle the load.

3644
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:28,200
Thank God for Amazon Web Services and cloud hosting

3645
02:29:28,200 --> 02:29:31,020
because Epic went to 15 million concurrent users

3646
02:29:31,020 --> 02:29:33,660
without buying any server hardware.

3647
02:29:33,660 --> 02:29:37,650
We are able to just call up Amazon and say, "We need more."

3648
02:29:37,650 --> 02:29:38,730
And there was a period of time there

3649
02:29:38,730 --> 02:29:40,890
where "Fortnite" was undergoing this exponential growth

3650
02:29:40,890 --> 02:29:44,370
and we'd find like one week we ran out of servers in Brazil

3651
02:29:44,370 --> 02:29:45,900
during a heavy weekend of play

3652
02:29:45,900 --> 02:29:49,170
and next week we had an even heavier weekend of play

3653
02:29:49,170 --> 02:29:50,610
and there were servers to handle it.

3654
02:29:50,610 --> 02:29:53,700
Like somebody at Amazon had dropped shipped, you know,

3655
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:56,820
millions of dollars of server hardware into Brazil

3656
02:29:56,820 --> 02:30:00,360
and turned it on just in time for "Fortnite" to need it.

3657
02:30:00,360 --> 02:30:02,580
And you know, there are a lot of unsung heroes

3658
02:30:02,580 --> 02:30:05,250
in that story, many of whom we've never heard of.

3659
02:30:05,250 --> 02:30:10,250
- Yeah, I mean behind AWS many unsung heroes.

3660
02:30:10,560 --> 02:30:13,150
It's like so much of those folks who run

3661
02:30:14,296 --> 02:30:17,070
the modern internet, all the incredible services, the games,

3662
02:30:17,070 --> 02:30:19,650
the services that we take for granted

3663
02:30:19,650 --> 02:30:21,450
are currently being run on AWS

3664
02:30:21,450 --> 02:30:25,293
or were originally and Google Cloud and so on.

3665
02:30:27,090 --> 02:30:31,188
Yeah, can you speak to how much money "Fortnite" made?

3666
02:30:31,188 --> 02:30:32,640
(Lex laughing)

3667
02:30:32,640 --> 02:30:34,680
So this is like one of the greatest successes

3668
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:36,877
in the history of video games also.

3669
02:30:36,877 --> 02:30:39,900
- "Fortnite" makes billions of dollars a year

3670
02:30:39,900 --> 02:30:42,303
and that's the majority of Epic's revenue

3671
02:30:42,303 --> 02:30:44,460
that we have a robust business

3672
02:30:44,460 --> 02:30:46,680
around on Unreal Engine licensing, "Rocket League"

3673
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:47,670
and "Fall Guys"

3674
02:30:47,670 --> 02:30:50,970
and some other tools like the Fab content marketplace.

3675
02:30:50,970 --> 02:30:53,280
But the majority of it is "Fortnite"

3676
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,980
because we've chosen to reinvest heavily in building

3677
02:30:55,980 --> 02:30:58,380
what we think is the future of technology.

3678
02:30:58,380 --> 02:31:01,200
We're spending more every year than we're making.

3679
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,360
And for a bit of time we were spending

3680
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:05,430
over a billion dollars a year more than we were making

3681
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:07,620
and we found that to be unsustainable

3682
02:31:07,620 --> 02:31:11,700
and we went through some painful layoffs at that time

3683
02:31:11,700 --> 02:31:13,290
and then we stabilize and now we're spending

3684
02:31:13,290 --> 02:31:14,700
several hundred million dollars a year

3685
02:31:14,700 --> 02:31:15,533
more than we're making,

3686
02:31:15,533 --> 02:31:16,800
which we can very well afford to do

3687
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:19,133
because we have billions of dollars in the bank.

3688
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,770
You know, thanks to a combination of the profits we made

3689
02:31:22,770 --> 02:31:25,287
when we were a very small company with a very big game.

3690
02:31:25,287 --> 02:31:27,810
And because of investment we've raised.

3691
02:31:27,810 --> 02:31:30,360
We're not an pumping oil out of the ground at

3692
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:31,230
where we discovered oil.

3693
02:31:31,230 --> 02:31:34,770
We are growing to be a future technology powerhouse

3694
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:36,160
and we think that 3D space

3695
02:31:37,050 --> 02:31:39,750
and the future of real-time 3D simulations is going

3696
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:42,720
to be one of the major facets of technology for humanity.

3697
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:45,362
And we're all investing in that.

3698
02:31:45,362 --> 02:31:46,195
- Yeah, it's exciting to see

3699
02:31:46,195 --> 02:31:48,660
that investing in a long-term future,

3700
02:31:48,660 --> 02:31:51,150
sort of taking the risk of doing the research

3701
02:31:51,150 --> 02:31:53,310
and defining the next chapter of Epic.

3702
02:31:53,310 --> 02:31:55,620
So using the successes of the day

3703
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:57,360
to invest into the successes of tomorrow,

3704
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:00,540
that might look very different, like completely different.

3705
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:03,690
And part of that is investing in the developments,

3706
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:08,250
the research and the innovation in the Unreal Engine.

3707
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:09,420
- That's right, we're a company

3708
02:32:09,420 --> 02:32:11,670
that can start working on a project knowing

3709
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:15,180
that we won't reach fruition or make any money

3710
02:32:15,180 --> 02:32:18,960
from it at all for three years, four years, five years.

3711
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:20,760
We're totally okay with that.

3712
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:22,020
And you know, that's the cycle

3713
02:32:22,020 --> 02:32:23,970
that's fueled our growth over time.

3714
02:32:23,970 --> 02:32:25,890
It's constantly investing in the future

3715
02:32:25,890 --> 02:32:28,470
and you know, being a serious company that's doing

3716
02:32:28,470 --> 02:32:30,870
serious R and D side by side

3717
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:32,340
with shipping and maintaining products

3718
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:34,140
and earning money from them.

3719
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:36,120
- So can you speak to,

3720
02:32:36,120 --> 02:32:37,680
I mean there's several directions here.

3721
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:41,990
So one of them sort of the future evolution

3722
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:44,340
of this idea of the metaverse,

3723
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:47,490
so potentially creating communities.

3724
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:50,940
So "Fortnite" is this incredible,

3725
02:32:50,940 --> 02:32:55,290
huge community of humans interacting,

3726
02:32:55,290 --> 02:32:59,193
but your vision is to go outside of just one game.

3727
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:03,270
So what is the kinds of standards

3728
02:33:03,270 --> 02:33:06,300
that you're thinking about building

3729
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:08,820
such that people can sort of have an identity

3730
02:33:08,820 --> 02:33:11,580
to almost travel between games and that kind of thing?

3731
02:33:11,580 --> 02:33:14,599
- Lemme start with the present of gaming and why it sucks.

3732
02:33:14,599 --> 02:33:15,432
(Tim and Lex laughing)

3733
02:33:15,432 --> 02:33:17,751
- Like that's a good start, sure.

3734
02:33:17,751 --> 02:33:18,720
- "Fortnite" is an awesome thing.

3735
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:21,090
You go into "Fortnite," there's, you know,

3736
02:33:21,090 --> 02:33:22,950
a hundred million monthly active users there,

3737
02:33:22,950 --> 02:33:24,450
a huge number of your own friends are there,

3738
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:25,650
you can play with them,

3739
02:33:25,650 --> 02:33:27,540
go from experience to experience seamlessly

3740
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:29,370
without leaving the app.

3741
02:33:29,370 --> 02:33:31,890
There a hundred thousand different islands you can play on.

3742
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:34,170
And some of them are really awesome

3743
02:33:34,170 --> 02:33:35,550
and they're constant new ones coming out

3744
02:33:35,550 --> 02:33:36,850
and constant things to do.

3745
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:39,870
If you wanna play "Roblox", all right, you quit

3746
02:33:39,870 --> 02:33:41,970
out of the "Fortnite" app, you launch the "Roblox" app,

3747
02:33:41,970 --> 02:33:44,850
different program, different friend system,

3748
02:33:44,850 --> 02:33:47,070
different account names, your username in "Fortnite"

3749
02:33:47,070 --> 02:33:48,780
and your username and "Roblox" are different names

3750
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:49,820
and they're not connected to each other.

3751
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:51,330
So you have to remake all of your friends

3752
02:33:51,330 --> 02:33:53,543
and then find different, you know, things to play.

3753
02:33:53,543 --> 02:33:55,110
And now the controls are different.

3754
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:56,550
So you have to relearn how, you know,

3755
02:33:56,550 --> 02:34:00,540
the joystick, mouse, keyboard controller works in

3756
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:02,730
that experience and you have to go from place to place.

3757
02:34:02,730 --> 02:34:04,770
And you buy some stuff in "Fortnite" and it's really cool

3758
02:34:04,770 --> 02:34:05,940
and you can use it anywhere in "Fortnite."

3759
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:07,521
And then you go in "Roblox"

3760
02:34:07,521 --> 02:34:08,520
and you don't have that stuff,

3761
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:09,990
you have to buy different stuff

3762
02:34:09,990 --> 02:34:11,520
and that stuff only works in "Roblox".

3763
02:34:11,520 --> 02:34:15,120
And same with "Call of Duty", it's another isolated place.

3764
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:16,770
And same with "World of Warcraft",

3765
02:34:16,770 --> 02:34:17,970
and same with "League of Legends"

3766
02:34:17,970 --> 02:34:21,000
and every place you go is its own unique place,

3767
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:22,590
different friends, different account names,

3768
02:34:22,590 --> 02:34:23,423
different people.

3769
02:34:23,423 --> 02:34:26,550
And there's no social cohesion between them at all.

3770
02:34:26,550 --> 02:34:29,760
And long time ago, console was set out to solve this problem

3771
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:32,220
by creating their console-wide friend system in account.

3772
02:34:32,220 --> 02:34:34,410
So your friend on PlayStation in one game is your friends

3773
02:34:34,410 --> 02:34:37,350
on PlayStation in another game, but only on PlayStation.

3774
02:34:37,350 --> 02:34:40,110
If you're on Xbox you can't see PlayStation friends.

3775
02:34:40,110 --> 02:34:43,140
And so you have two basically orthogonal

3776
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:47,640
and cross-cutting divisions of the world into fiefdoms,

3777
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:50,880
you know, which were not created with bad intentions

3778
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:54,720
but arose and are, you know, separated, isolated islands.

3779
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:57,540
One is the platforms and their social services,

3780
02:34:57,540 --> 02:34:59,280
Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo,

3781
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:01,223
it's Steam, Epic if you add it to the list.

3782
02:35:01,223 --> 02:35:03,600
And the other is these different games people play

3783
02:35:03,600 --> 02:35:08,600
and you know, because of this weird historical artifact

3784
02:35:09,030 --> 02:35:10,440
where we're left in a world

3785
02:35:10,440 --> 02:35:12,900
where people can't seamlessly move from games to games,

3786
02:35:12,900 --> 02:35:14,820
bringing their friends and their stuff.

3787
02:35:14,820 --> 02:35:17,700
So the solution to this is to federate

3788
02:35:17,700 --> 02:35:19,740
and connect all of the systems together.

3789
02:35:19,740 --> 02:35:21,990
All of the players on all the different platforms

3790
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:24,360
can be recognized by their name

3791
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:25,830
and put the @ sign in it,

3792
02:35:25,830 --> 02:35:28,500
so your Xbox names and your "Fortnite" or Epic names

3793
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:31,200
and your Steam names can all live together

3794
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:33,120
and operate together in a single space.

3795
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:35,070
So unifying the social ecosystems

3796
02:35:35,070 --> 02:35:36,770
is one thing that needs to happen.

3797
02:35:37,950 --> 02:35:42,120
The next and bigger challenge is to unify the economies too.

3798
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:45,637
Now I'm not talking about like a sword you have in

3799
02:35:45,637 --> 02:35:47,797
"World of Warcraft" should work in "Fortnite".

3800
02:35:47,797 --> 02:35:49,650
(Lex laughing)

3801
02:35:49,650 --> 02:35:51,570
Every game's gonna have its own gameplay rules

3802
02:35:51,570 --> 02:35:52,713
and a lot of games are gonna have stuff

3803
02:35:52,713 --> 02:35:54,660
that only works in them.

3804
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:56,733
But you know, there's a huge set of games

3805
02:35:56,733 --> 02:36:00,180
that have in common the idea of a cosmetic system

3806
02:36:00,180 --> 02:36:02,910
that does not affect gameplay outcomes

3807
02:36:02,910 --> 02:36:06,243
but is, you know, purely cool looks and cool appearances.

3808
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:10,590
Most of the major multiplayer games have them

3809
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:12,293
and you know,

3810
02:36:12,293 --> 02:36:14,700
if you look at games you could probably bundle it together

3811
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:16,860
about 70% of them and say they're similar enough

3812
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:18,960
that they could actually interoperate.

3813
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:20,730
That you could own an outfit in "Fortnite,"

3814
02:36:20,730 --> 02:36:22,320
own an outfit in "Roblox",

3815
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:25,770
and own the same outfit in maybe "Call of Duty"

3816
02:36:25,770 --> 02:36:28,380
and maybe, you know, a hundred or 200 other games

3817
02:36:28,380 --> 02:36:31,268
and actually expect they would work together.

3818
02:36:31,268 --> 02:36:32,340
And you find other kinds of items

3819
02:36:32,340 --> 02:36:33,600
are probably interoperable too.

3820
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:37,617
Like "Fortnite" has car outfits so you can, you know,

3821
02:36:37,617 --> 02:36:39,300
buy different appearances of a car.

3822
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:41,280
And when you find a physical car in the world of "Fortnite,"

3823
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:44,040
if you're the first person to get into it in that session,

3824
02:36:44,040 --> 02:36:48,600
boom, it takes on your, you know, your chosen car cosmetic

3825
02:36:48,600 --> 02:36:51,723
and now you have a cool car that's identifiable as yours.

3826
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:55,950
You know, we realized early on with "Fortnite" that the key

3827
02:36:55,950 --> 02:36:58,500
to making "Fortnite" work as a creator economy

3828
02:36:58,500 --> 02:37:01,800
was to open up the revenue from the item shop

3829
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:03,930
to all of those sources of engagement, right?

3830
02:37:03,930 --> 02:37:06,810
There are two big things happening in "Fortnite"

3831
02:37:06,810 --> 02:37:09,090
that make it work as a product and as a business.

3832
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:11,970
One is the game modes, "Fortnite: Battle Royale",

3833
02:37:11,970 --> 02:37:13,650
and all of the user modes and everything else

3834
02:37:13,650 --> 02:37:14,700
are sources of engagement.

3835
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:17,640
People play there because it's super fun.

3836
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:19,980
And because they're playing there, they're willing

3837
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:22,680
to buy cool stuff to make their character look cooler.

3838
02:37:23,880 --> 02:37:25,680
And so you have all of these sources of engagement,

3839
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:28,140
but the sources of engagement don't make money directly.

3840
02:37:28,140 --> 02:37:30,570
You can't spend money in "Fortnite: Battle Royale"

3841
02:37:30,570 --> 02:37:33,690
to buy a game item like everything's, you know,

3842
02:37:33,690 --> 02:37:37,260
the gameplay is not pay to win and it's all just a game.

3843
02:37:37,260 --> 02:37:40,170
So we make money from the item shop

3844
02:37:40,170 --> 02:37:41,880
and the item shop only exists

3845
02:37:41,880 --> 02:37:43,530
because of the sources of engagement.

3846
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:45,060
If you weren't playing "Battle Royale," trust me,

3847
02:37:45,060 --> 02:37:46,680
nobody would wanna buy a "Fortnite" outfit.

3848
02:37:46,680 --> 02:37:48,120
If you weren't playing any "Fortnite" games,

3849
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:50,010
why would you buy "Fortnite" outfits?

3850
02:37:50,010 --> 02:37:53,250
And so you have all the revenue in this item shop economy

3851
02:37:53,250 --> 02:37:55,710
and all of the engagement in this engagement economy.

3852
02:37:55,710 --> 02:37:57,690
And the thing that magically makes the "Fortnite" creator

3853
02:37:57,690 --> 02:37:59,670
economy works is revenue sharing.

3854
02:37:59,670 --> 02:38:02,790
Item shop spending according to sources of engagement,

3855
02:38:02,790 --> 02:38:05,130
buy engagement, if you buy an item

3856
02:38:05,130 --> 02:38:07,530
and you've played, you know, 40% of your time

3857
02:38:07,530 --> 02:38:10,410
in Battle Royale and 60% of your time in these user modes,

3858
02:38:10,410 --> 02:38:12,570
the amount you spent, the portion of that

3859
02:38:12,570 --> 02:38:14,460
that's profit can be separated out

3860
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:16,290
and paid out to all the different creators

3861
02:38:16,290 --> 02:38:18,237
who participate in that economy.

3862
02:38:18,237 --> 02:38:19,770
And that's why "Fortnite" scaled up

3863
02:38:19,770 --> 02:38:23,940
to a $400 million creator economy so far and is growing.

3864
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:25,020
- It's amazing.

3865
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:27,120
- One of the really critical things we aim

3866
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:29,760
to do in designing that is ensure it's a creator economy

3867
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:33,630
that could scale to other companies, other ecosystems.

3868
02:38:33,630 --> 02:38:35,280
And say, you know, right now we have

3869
02:38:35,280 --> 02:38:37,590
many industry standards bodies,

3870
02:38:37,590 --> 02:38:40,050
so one standardized game ratings, you know,

3871
02:38:40,050 --> 02:38:43,950
age ratings of games, another standardized file formats

3872
02:38:43,950 --> 02:38:45,780
for the web, another style, you know,

3873
02:38:45,780 --> 02:38:47,883
standardizing file formats for 3D

3874
02:38:47,883 --> 02:38:50,820
like Khronos Groups in the Metaverse standards form.

3875
02:38:50,820 --> 02:38:53,430
If we had a standards body standardize

3876
02:38:53,430 --> 02:38:56,130
what are portable outfits in games, you know,

3877
02:38:56,130 --> 02:38:59,160
game outfits you could buy in one game that work in another.

3878
02:38:59,160 --> 02:39:00,750
What are their, you know, dimensions

3879
02:39:00,750 --> 02:39:02,190
and what are their capabilities

3880
02:39:02,190 --> 02:39:03,237
and what can you do

3881
02:39:03,237 --> 02:39:04,923
and what can't you do and so on.

3882
02:39:06,060 --> 02:39:09,480
Then you could have an item economy where every game agrees

3883
02:39:09,480 --> 02:39:12,960
to respect each other's item purchases of that sort.

3884
02:39:12,960 --> 02:39:15,631
And revenue is shared between ecosystems as well.

3885
02:39:15,631 --> 02:39:16,710
- That would be incredible.

3886
02:39:16,710 --> 02:39:18,360
That would be so amazing.

3887
02:39:18,360 --> 02:39:23,340
Is there, first of all, just it seems silly maybe

3888
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:24,750
for people who don't play video games,

3889
02:39:24,750 --> 02:39:26,880
but an outfit is an important...

3890
02:39:26,880 --> 02:39:30,933
If an outfit can be persistent across video games,

3891
02:39:31,860 --> 02:39:35,340
I mean, I don't know what's the purpose of life?

3892
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:37,080
Like, why do we wear clothing?

3893
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:39,690
Clothing is a part of our identity.

3894
02:39:39,690 --> 02:39:41,520
It's how we present ourselves to the world.

3895
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:44,340
It's, you know, I wear the stupid suit and tie.

3896
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:45,173
It feels good.

3897
02:39:45,173 --> 02:39:46,670
It feels good when I put it on.

3898
02:39:47,670 --> 02:39:50,040
And even like the other outfit, I have two outfits,

3899
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:53,280
this and then a black t-shirt and jeans.

3900
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,250
And it feels good to wear that.

3901
02:39:55,250 --> 02:39:57,150
It feels like me when I look in the mirror.

3902
02:39:57,150 --> 02:39:59,340
Okay, I know that guy.

3903
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:03,030
And to be able to have that outfit go from game to game

3904
02:40:03,030 --> 02:40:05,703
to game maybe across years, that would be wonderful.

3905
02:40:07,170 --> 02:40:09,570
I wonder if you could just even comment,

3906
02:40:09,570 --> 02:40:14,160
could there also be another standardization about the value?

3907
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:18,060
So for more complicated items, so, you know,

3908
02:40:18,060 --> 02:40:20,400
take a sword from "Diablo"

3909
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:24,270
and transfer to a gun in "Fortnite."

3910
02:40:24,270 --> 02:40:27,210
But based on the value some, you know,

3911
02:40:27,210 --> 02:40:29,970
some generic concept of money.

3912
02:40:29,970 --> 02:40:32,460
So the value of a thing in one game

3913
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:35,280
versus the value of a thing in another game

3914
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:38,550
where you're almost operating in a space of value

3915
02:40:38,550 --> 02:40:41,040
versus the actual items.

3916
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:46,020
Or is that already getting too general?

3917
02:40:46,020 --> 02:40:48,870
- I think this can be done, yeah.

3918
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:51,630
We did a lot of analysis of the "Fortnite" economy

3919
02:40:51,630 --> 02:40:56,630
and found that some "Fortnite" experiences

3920
02:40:56,940 --> 02:41:00,693
lead to or correlate with higher spending than others.

3921
02:41:01,950 --> 02:41:06,510
And you know, "Battle Royale" is relatively strong

3922
02:41:06,510 --> 02:41:09,720
in that area because you see your character from behind

3923
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:12,240
and see all of your other characters from the front,

3924
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:14,550
and you have lots of opportunities to really see who you are

3925
02:41:14,550 --> 02:41:17,043
and to emote and to interact with other players.

3926
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:21,033
And a lot of games have that characteristic.

3927
02:41:22,230 --> 02:41:24,437
One funny anomaly stood out.

3928
02:41:24,437 --> 02:41:25,270
There was this game

3929
02:41:25,270 --> 02:41:26,160
that was one of the big breakthroughs

3930
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:27,870
in "Fortnite," "Only Up."

3931
02:41:27,870 --> 02:41:29,670
It's a game where you're just climbing up in the up

3932
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:32,870
by following pads of stacks of objects and things.

3933
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:35,040
It was just stupid fun. (Lex laughing)

3934
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:37,470
Everybody loved, okay, but we found people weren't spending

3935
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:40,530
a lot of money on outfits

3936
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:42,450
when they were playing "Only Up".

3937
02:41:42,450 --> 02:41:43,590
It's kind of intuitive actually.

3938
02:41:43,590 --> 02:41:44,970
Like you're not seeing other players,

3939
02:41:44,970 --> 02:41:47,580
like if you see anything, like you're seeing their butt

3940
02:41:47,580 --> 02:41:49,290
as you're like trying to catch up to them,

3941
02:41:49,290 --> 02:41:51,890
jumping from object to object and they're above you.

3942
02:41:52,830 --> 02:41:54,090
And so, you know, it wasn't a mode

3943
02:41:54,090 --> 02:41:55,470
that shut off outfits very much,

3944
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:56,820
but you could, you know,

3945
02:41:56,820 --> 02:41:59,190
you can determine the economic correlation

3946
02:41:59,190 --> 02:42:02,370
between a game mode and spending.

3947
02:42:02,370 --> 02:42:03,720
- That's so fascinating.

3948
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:05,910
I mean, "Fortnite" is this gigantic economy

3949
02:42:05,910 --> 02:42:07,290
where you could do those kinds of studies,

3950
02:42:07,290 --> 02:42:09,990
you can understand markets, the digital markets

3951
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:12,960
as they emerge amongst humans and what they value.

3952
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:15,750
And from that value, you can probably have a very stable

3953
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:17,523
kind of money that emerges.

3954
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:19,193
- Yeah, I think so.

3955
02:42:19,193 --> 02:42:21,090
You don't need like an alternate currency system,

3956
02:42:21,090 --> 02:42:23,640
you know, unfortunately, a bunch of ideas have conflated

3957
02:42:23,640 --> 02:42:25,650
because people were trying to hype up different things.

3958
02:42:25,650 --> 02:42:28,410
But you know, this idea of large scale multiplayer

3959
02:42:28,410 --> 02:42:32,460
social gaming, you know, that notion of the metaverse,

3960
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:37,230
you know, there's 600 to 800 million people playing

3961
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:38,940
that kind of game every month.

3962
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:40,740
So like, you know, that's real and that's happening

3963
02:42:40,740 --> 02:42:42,690
and it's, you know, very much underway.

3964
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:45,150
VR has a much smaller audience.

3965
02:42:45,150 --> 02:42:46,923
I don't think you need VR to have anything like this.

3966
02:42:46,923 --> 02:42:49,770
Like VR is hardware that may or may not enhance

3967
02:42:49,770 --> 02:42:52,020
the experience for some usage cases.

3968
02:42:52,020 --> 02:42:53,007
For some it'll probably be better

3969
02:42:53,007 --> 02:42:54,660
and for some it'll probably be worse,

3970
02:42:54,660 --> 02:42:56,910
but certainly there's not any set

3971
02:42:56,910 --> 02:43:01,910
of "Battle Royale" players flocking to VR.

3972
02:43:02,490 --> 02:43:05,730
And the other thing is NFT is it's like you trying

3973
02:43:05,730 --> 02:43:10,218
to equate digital or cryptocurrency to the metaverse.

3974
02:43:10,218 --> 02:43:15,218
It's just a way of denoting money or value exchange.

3975
02:43:15,630 --> 02:43:17,790
You can do that with money or you can do it with NFTs

3976
02:43:17,790 --> 02:43:20,940
or whatever, but there's nothing about this future digital

3977
02:43:20,940 --> 02:43:22,560
economy that fundamentally requires

3978
02:43:22,560 --> 02:43:24,360
cryptocurrency or whatever.

3979
02:43:24,360 --> 02:43:26,130
What you need is interoperability.

3980
02:43:26,130 --> 02:43:28,080
Interoperability can happen through a blockchain,

3981
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:29,250
it can happen through a database,

3982
02:43:29,250 --> 02:43:31,110
it can happen through standards bodies

3983
02:43:31,110 --> 02:43:33,030
with defining standards and protocols.

3984
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:35,550
And we've been doing it for hundreds of years

3985
02:43:35,550 --> 02:43:37,230
since the railroads were standardized.

3986
02:43:37,230 --> 02:43:40,050
And you know, it's not something

3987
02:43:40,050 --> 02:43:43,023
that totally requires a novel technological solution.

3988
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:48,603
- Yeah, I mean even on the topic of cryptocurrency,

3989
02:43:48,603 --> 02:43:50,043
it's very frustrating.

3990
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:54,580
You know, blockchain and crypto is a really powerful

3991
02:43:55,920 --> 02:43:58,770
technology that I think can enable

3992
02:43:58,770 --> 02:44:00,300
a lot of the things that we're talking about.

3993
02:44:00,300 --> 02:44:05,130
But so many people use it to try to make money

3994
02:44:05,130 --> 02:44:06,480
to create these bubbles.

3995
02:44:06,480 --> 02:44:09,630
And the hype and the meme coins and the so on and so forth,

3996
02:44:09,630 --> 02:44:11,170
that becomes much less about

3997
02:44:12,180 --> 02:44:16,680
that drifts far away and rapidly

3998
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:19,530
from things that are actually of value,

3999
02:44:19,530 --> 02:44:22,230
which is the experience of playing "Fortnite"

4000
02:44:22,230 --> 02:44:24,930
and how you look when you play "Battle Royale."

4001
02:44:24,930 --> 02:44:26,937
I mean, it sounds ridiculous to say, but it's true.

4002
02:44:26,937 --> 02:44:28,743
But that's valuable.

4003
02:44:29,634 --> 02:44:30,467
That's like, you know,

4004
02:44:30,467 --> 02:44:32,760
you have like gold in the physical space.

4005
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:35,193
We know that holds value.

4006
02:44:36,961 --> 02:44:39,450
How your outfit looks like in "Fortnite" that,

4007
02:44:39,450 --> 02:44:43,020
as you're saying, provably holds value.

4008
02:44:43,020 --> 02:44:45,090
And so you want to connect

4009
02:44:45,090 --> 02:44:50,090
like a standard definition of money value

4010
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:55,740
to that and not let it become this hype thing which NFTs

4011
02:44:55,740 --> 02:44:58,080
that you mentioned are just become that.

4012
02:44:58,080 --> 02:44:59,640
Like quickly drifts away

4013
02:44:59,640 --> 02:45:01,710
into the land of people trying to buy

4014
02:45:01,710 --> 02:45:05,520
and sell and try to make money versus like staying close

4015
02:45:05,520 --> 02:45:07,650
to the thing that people actually value.

4016
02:45:07,650 --> 02:45:10,800
Forget the money, it's more about exchanging

4017
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:14,160
valuable experiences or things of value.

4018
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:16,653
So you can play "Fortnite"

4019
02:45:17,550 --> 02:45:21,000
and then go to another video game

4020
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,670
and continue the valuable experience

4021
02:45:23,670 --> 02:45:26,340
and then come back to "Fortnite" and do that kind of thing.

4022
02:45:26,340 --> 02:45:30,870
So you're saying there might be a way to do that

4023
02:45:30,870 --> 02:45:33,690
and to basically create standards

4024
02:45:33,690 --> 02:45:35,640
the way the web has different standards

4025
02:45:38,185 --> 02:45:40,580
for displaying websites and all this kind of stuff

4026
02:45:40,580 --> 02:45:41,970
or the communication

4027
02:45:41,970 --> 02:45:43,680
that's required on the networking side.

4028
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,770
So all the different standards that make the web work,

4029
02:45:46,770 --> 02:45:48,870
there need to be those kinds of standards.

4030
02:45:48,870 --> 02:45:51,510
Like what would those standards look like

4031
02:45:51,510 --> 02:45:52,920
to enable the metaverse?

4032
02:45:52,920 --> 02:45:54,930
- We need a lot of different things.

4033
02:45:54,930 --> 02:45:56,460
The one area where the standards bodies

4034
02:45:56,460 --> 02:45:58,650
have been very successful in creating working standards

4035
02:45:58,650 --> 02:46:00,930
implemented by all the major engines today

4036
02:46:00,930 --> 02:46:04,890
is in low level file formats for data interchange.

4037
02:46:04,890 --> 02:46:07,840
You know, the web has PNG files for 2D images

4038
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:12,450
and in MP3 files for audio.

4039
02:46:12,450 --> 02:46:15,330
And 3D has the Pixar USD file format,

4040
02:46:15,330 --> 02:46:18,420
the universal scene description, which is a description

4041
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:20,610
of the scene graph, the entire set of objects in the scene

4042
02:46:20,610 --> 02:46:22,590
and all of their parameters so that any engine

4043
02:46:22,590 --> 02:46:24,930
that supports those features could import that

4044
02:46:24,930 --> 02:46:28,320
and then render the same scene as the engine they came from.

4045
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:30,870
You know, large parts of this work across Unreal Engine

4046
02:46:30,870 --> 02:46:32,010
and Unity and Blender

4047
02:46:32,010 --> 02:46:35,621
and all of these 3D packages of different sorts.

4048
02:46:35,621 --> 02:46:39,600
Then there's the GLTF texture format, which stores textures

4049
02:46:39,600 --> 02:46:42,512
and geometry and other low level data for 3D objects.

4050
02:46:42,512 --> 02:46:44,370
You know, when you see a "Fortnite" character

4051
02:46:44,370 --> 02:46:46,710
that file format together with the image file formats

4052
02:46:46,710 --> 02:46:48,663
can store their static appearance,

4053
02:46:50,070 --> 02:46:52,350
you know, the shape of their body,

4054
02:46:52,350 --> 02:46:56,040
even their animations and their different poses

4055
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:56,907
and the appearance of them,

4056
02:46:56,907 --> 02:46:59,430
the different standard file formats could store

4057
02:46:59,430 --> 02:47:01,080
all of the sounds they make in their emotes.

4058
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:03,180
But we're still missing a bunch of pieces.

4059
02:47:04,290 --> 02:47:06,480
The biggest missing piece is the programming language

4060
02:47:06,480 --> 02:47:09,750
that's at the center of standardizing the metaverse.

4061
02:47:09,750 --> 02:47:13,140
Now if you look at the web, the web is a combination

4062
02:47:13,140 --> 02:47:14,670
of a bunch of different technologies.

4063
02:47:14,670 --> 02:47:17,130
The two biggest ones are HTML,

4064
02:47:17,130 --> 02:47:21,120
which describes the 2D scene graph or the, you know,

4065
02:47:21,120 --> 02:47:23,973
2D layout of controls and objects on the webpage.

4066
02:47:25,110 --> 02:47:26,640
But that's just static data.

4067
02:47:26,640 --> 02:47:29,520
It's just a non-moving, non animating webpage.

4068
02:47:29,520 --> 02:47:32,160
And then you have the JavaScript programming language,

4069
02:47:32,160 --> 02:47:34,470
which is used to manipulate that to display things

4070
02:47:34,470 --> 02:47:36,300
to the user and to implement anything

4071
02:47:36,300 --> 02:47:37,770
you could implement in code.

4072
02:47:37,770 --> 02:47:39,000
So it's a little programming language

4073
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:40,500
that runs in your web browser.

4074
02:47:41,430 --> 02:47:42,720
And the Metaverse needs something

4075
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:44,790
that performs that similar role.

4076
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:48,810
But the Metaverse and 3D gaming in general needs something

4077
02:47:48,810 --> 02:47:52,740
that's rather more powerful, more safe, more scalable,

4078
02:47:52,740 --> 02:47:55,500
and more capable than JavaScript

4079
02:47:55,500 --> 02:47:57,600
because the metaverse is actually more difficult

4080
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:59,940
technical problem than a webpage.

4081
02:47:59,940 --> 02:48:04,207
A webpage like an app is just a single bundle of code

4082
02:48:05,100 --> 02:48:08,580
and content that somebody, a company, has prepared

4083
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:11,340
and they release it and it stays exactly what it is

4084
02:48:11,340 --> 02:48:12,570
until they release a new version

4085
02:48:12,570 --> 02:48:15,690
and it's upgraded from version to version as it goes.

4086
02:48:15,690 --> 02:48:20,310
But the metaverse needs to be a composite of code

4087
02:48:20,310 --> 02:48:22,443
and content built by millions of different people

4088
02:48:22,443 --> 02:48:25,170
that could potentially form a seamless world together.

4089
02:48:25,170 --> 02:48:27,810
- Yeah, it's fully distributed collaborative.

4090
02:48:27,810 --> 02:48:31,233
First of all, also the amount of data,

4091
02:48:32,370 --> 02:48:34,680
I mean it doesn't have to be that way,

4092
02:48:34,680 --> 02:48:37,383
but websites are showing very little information.

4093
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:42,127
The metaverse, even when it looks like something like

4094
02:48:42,127 --> 02:48:46,320
"Fortnite," just the amount of information

4095
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:49,290
that's conveyed in the scene graph

4096
02:48:49,290 --> 02:48:52,920
as the individual players are collaborating is a huge,

4097
02:48:52,920 --> 02:48:54,480
huge, huge amount.

4098
02:48:54,480 --> 02:48:57,390
- Yeah, the highest detail of "Fortnite" updates

4099
02:48:57,390 --> 02:48:59,673
amount to about 60 gigabytes of data.

4100
02:49:00,870 --> 02:49:02,700
And you know, that's just a small part of

4101
02:49:02,700 --> 02:49:05,550
what exists in the "Fortnite" creative economy.

4102
02:49:05,550 --> 02:49:08,100
And if you look at what this might be in a decade

4103
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:10,020
as standards emerge, you might have exabytes

4104
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:12,307
of data out there.

4105
02:49:12,307 --> 02:49:14,010
"Fortnite: Battle Royale" is I don't think

4106
02:49:14,010 --> 02:49:15,937
the ultimate manifestation of gameplay that will,

4107
02:49:15,937 --> 02:49:18,120
you know, ever be invented.

4108
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:20,340
What we've seen time and time again is that

4109
02:49:20,340 --> 02:49:23,730
as we gain more technical capabilities,

4110
02:49:23,730 --> 02:49:27,600
graphics gets more capable, CPUs become more performant.

4111
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:31,890
You know, web services become ever more scalable.

4112
02:49:31,890 --> 02:49:33,690
We've seen new genres of games that emerge

4113
02:49:33,690 --> 02:49:35,790
that weren't possible before

4114
02:49:35,790 --> 02:49:38,970
and you know, "Doom" ushered in the era of Death Match

4115
02:49:38,970 --> 02:49:40,680
and the first time 3D multiplayer game

4116
02:49:40,680 --> 02:49:42,720
was even possible at all.

4117
02:49:42,720 --> 02:49:44,490
You know, the early "Battle Royale" games

4118
02:49:44,490 --> 02:49:47,080
starting about 10 years or 15 years ago

4119
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:50,040
only became possible back then.

4120
02:49:50,040 --> 02:49:51,810
You couldn't have built one 20 years ago

4121
02:49:51,810 --> 02:49:54,450
because you just couldn't have rendered an environment

4122
02:49:54,450 --> 02:49:57,600
that's as large as a VR game with that many players,

4123
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:59,490
with that level of interaction and performance.

4124
02:49:59,490 --> 02:50:02,190
It was just not possible to run it.

4125
02:50:02,190 --> 02:50:04,290
So you got a certain level of technical capabilities

4126
02:50:04,290 --> 02:50:05,670
and a genre came out that proved to be

4127
02:50:05,670 --> 02:50:08,520
by far the best shooter genre ever invented.

4128
02:50:08,520 --> 02:50:10,923
But I think there are numerous, numerous more genres,

4129
02:50:10,923 --> 02:50:13,170
some of which are better than any of the existing ones

4130
02:50:13,170 --> 02:50:16,380
that will be invented as we get more and more capabilities.

4131
02:50:16,380 --> 02:50:18,600
You know, some of the capabilities we're lacking now

4132
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:22,950
are the ability to build environments and game simulations

4133
02:50:22,950 --> 02:50:26,250
that span more work than a single company

4134
02:50:26,250 --> 02:50:27,630
can possibly create.

4135
02:50:27,630 --> 02:50:28,770
And you know, you see kind of the birth

4136
02:50:28,770 --> 02:50:30,510
of that idea in "Fortnite" and "Roblox"

4137
02:50:30,510 --> 02:50:32,250
where there are tens of thousands creators,

4138
02:50:32,250 --> 02:50:33,150
each building content.

4139
02:50:33,150 --> 02:50:35,973
And users are playing meaningful amounts of it all.

4140
02:50:35,973 --> 02:50:36,990
And so there's an ecosystem

4141
02:50:36,990 --> 02:50:38,970
that's scaled larger than company,

4142
02:50:38,970 --> 02:50:40,890
but it's still very much you go into one island

4143
02:50:40,890 --> 02:50:42,210
and you play that creator's work.

4144
02:50:42,210 --> 02:50:44,910
The other direction of its scalability is putting more

4145
02:50:44,910 --> 02:50:47,850
and more of people's work together in a seamless continuous

4146
02:50:47,850 --> 02:50:50,790
play space for games where that makes sense.

4147
02:50:50,790 --> 02:50:54,360
You know, you can imagine a game taking place

4148
02:50:54,360 --> 02:50:57,570
in an environment that is the size of a continent

4149
02:50:57,570 --> 02:51:01,530
or earth in which you can like go from place to place

4150
02:51:01,530 --> 02:51:03,060
and then see different areas

4151
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:04,487
which are maintained by different people.

4152
02:51:04,487 --> 02:51:06,300
So you go into different spaces,

4153
02:51:06,300 --> 02:51:08,340
the game rules are customized according to that

4154
02:51:08,340 --> 02:51:11,670
and you can go from experience to experience

4155
02:51:11,670 --> 02:51:14,070
and instead of having just one company's authorship

4156
02:51:14,070 --> 02:51:15,990
ever present wherever you are,

4157
02:51:15,990 --> 02:51:18,630
yeah you'd see you'd be driving a car built

4158
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:21,790
by one person, carrying weapons built by 20 other people

4159
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:26,100
and you know, taking place in a simulation in an environment

4160
02:51:26,100 --> 02:51:28,947
that's built by thousands of other people, you know,

4161
02:51:28,947 --> 02:51:31,230
and working for separate companies or their own,

4162
02:51:31,230 --> 02:51:35,280
you know, entrepreneurs or indies or enthusiasts

4163
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:37,050
all working together simultaneously.

4164
02:51:37,050 --> 02:51:39,903
And we totally lack the programming foundations for that.

4165
02:51:41,160 --> 02:51:42,630
You know, the kinds of code you would need

4166
02:51:42,630 --> 02:51:45,747
to write now to make that happen are just not practical.

4167
02:51:45,747 --> 02:51:48,300
And so we're investing massively in building

4168
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:51,000
new programming language technologies around Verse

4169
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,370
and our proposed standards for, you know,

4170
02:51:53,370 --> 02:51:55,230
future metaverse programming

4171
02:51:55,230 --> 02:51:57,510
that we hope will solve those kinds of problems

4172
02:51:57,510 --> 02:52:00,390
and make that kind of world possible.

4173
02:52:00,390 --> 02:52:05,390
- So first of all, that's a super exciting future where,

4174
02:52:05,670 --> 02:52:08,100
you know, it's not hundreds or thousands,

4175
02:52:08,100 --> 02:52:12,210
it's millions of creators that can just create

4176
02:52:12,210 --> 02:52:16,623
different small or big elements of a world as big as earth.

4177
02:52:18,030 --> 02:52:21,000
Just if you sort of close your eyes and imagine that world,

4178
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:22,413
that's really exciting.

4179
02:52:23,280 --> 02:52:26,070
Where it's not a centralized company controlling

4180
02:52:26,070 --> 02:52:29,250
the release of a particular island or so on.

4181
02:52:29,250 --> 02:52:32,280
It's people constantly dynamically modifying

4182
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:37,260
all the islands of reality in this digital world.

4183
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:41,640
So if you could speak to some of the technology

4184
02:52:41,640 --> 02:52:42,473
that can enable that,

4185
02:52:42,473 --> 02:52:44,400
you mentioned the Verse programming language.

4186
02:52:44,400 --> 02:52:49,400
First of all also, how legit is it for you CEO of Epic Games

4187
02:52:49,680 --> 02:52:51,450
to be a co-author?

4188
02:52:51,450 --> 02:52:55,156
The programming language theorists are losing their mind.

4189
02:52:55,156 --> 02:52:56,550
(Tim and Lex laughing)

4190
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:58,950
So co-author in a paper that's describing

4191
02:52:58,950 --> 02:53:00,750
some of the sort of nuance details

4192
02:53:00,750 --> 02:53:01,680
of a programming language.

4193
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:02,880
So maybe you could speak

4194
02:53:02,880 --> 02:53:05,910
to this programming language called Verse,

4195
02:53:05,910 --> 02:53:09,870
it's a functional logic language.

4196
02:53:09,870 --> 02:53:10,703
What is it?

4197
02:53:10,703 --> 02:53:13,050
What are some cool features of Verse?

4198
02:53:13,050 --> 02:53:15,450
- Verse is a programming language that we're building

4199
02:53:15,450 --> 02:53:18,720
for large scale simulation programming.

4200
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:21,540
It's designed to make it easy to write code

4201
02:53:21,540 --> 02:53:23,020
that can scale up to

4202
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:27,090
not only you building a "Fortnite" island

4203
02:53:27,090 --> 02:53:29,340
but you building modules

4204
02:53:29,340 --> 02:53:31,290
or components that can be used by millions

4205
02:53:31,290 --> 02:53:34,740
of other programmers and coexist in a huge environment

4206
02:53:34,740 --> 02:53:38,760
and also can scale up to a huge scale simulation.

4207
02:53:38,760 --> 02:53:42,510
Some games will be small "Battle Royale" might find

4208
02:53:42,510 --> 02:53:45,390
that, you know, a hundred players is actually optimal.

4209
02:53:45,390 --> 02:53:47,610
It might be the a thousand player version of "Battle Royale"

4210
02:53:47,610 --> 02:53:48,443
would be worse,

4211
02:53:48,443 --> 02:53:51,060
but I bet there are a thousand, million

4212
02:53:51,060 --> 02:53:53,730
and tens of million player experiences,

4213
02:53:53,730 --> 02:53:54,563
they're even better than that

4214
02:53:54,563 --> 02:53:56,430
that will yet to be discovered.

4215
02:53:56,430 --> 02:53:58,410
And so... - Wait, wait a minute,

4216
02:53:58,410 --> 02:54:03,240
tens of millions of players together.

4217
02:54:03,240 --> 02:54:05,490
- Sure we've had "Fortnite" events

4218
02:54:05,490 --> 02:54:08,460
that have attracted 15 million concurrent users

4219
02:54:08,460 --> 02:54:11,400
but you know, the fact that they're all divided up

4220
02:54:11,400 --> 02:54:13,440
into servers with a hundred players each

4221
02:54:13,440 --> 02:54:16,020
for those events isn't really a positive.

4222
02:54:16,020 --> 02:54:18,960
It's just a limitation of the technology.

4223
02:54:18,960 --> 02:54:20,310
Tracing back to Unreal Engine 1

4224
02:54:20,310 --> 02:54:22,710
and its single threading decisions.

4225
02:54:22,710 --> 02:54:24,390
You know, if we could build a concert

4226
02:54:24,390 --> 02:54:25,950
where all the concert participants,

4227
02:54:25,950 --> 02:54:27,300
potentially tens of millions of them,

4228
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:29,250
could participate together simultaneously

4229
02:54:29,250 --> 02:54:31,230
and see that there's that massive a crowd

4230
02:54:31,230 --> 02:54:32,910
and they could all do interesting things

4231
02:54:32,910 --> 02:54:35,520
and interact with each other, that would be way cooler.

4232
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:38,850
- Just if we just, sorry I'm just loading it in,

4233
02:54:38,850 --> 02:54:40,840
just imagining together

4234
02:54:42,180 --> 02:54:47,180
in one scene graph, 10 million people interacting,

4235
02:54:47,220 --> 02:54:48,990
what a cool world that is.

4236
02:54:48,990 --> 02:54:50,850
- Sure, well, you know, 10 million people,

4237
02:54:50,850 --> 02:54:53,010
you have less than 10 million pixels on your screen.

4238
02:54:53,010 --> 02:54:55,380
So what does the Nyquist sampling theorem say?

4239
02:54:55,380 --> 02:54:57,690
It says that you don't need full overhead for every player,

4240
02:54:57,690 --> 02:54:59,340
you need to render the players around you

4241
02:54:59,340 --> 02:55:01,260
in some approximation of everything else.

4242
02:55:01,260 --> 02:55:03,300
- Yeah, too, but there's also a networking component

4243
02:55:03,300 --> 02:55:07,719
like yeah you're speaking to the rendering but like, oh boy.

4244
02:55:07,719 --> 02:55:08,552
(Lex laughing)

4245
02:55:08,552 --> 02:55:09,930
- There's a lot of work that has to happen there

4246
02:55:09,930 --> 02:55:11,640
but you know, this is what we do for a living,

4247
02:55:11,640 --> 02:55:12,947
we solve hard problems. - [Lex] I understand

4248
02:55:12,947 --> 02:55:14,880
- 'Cause if they're easy then other people

4249
02:55:14,880 --> 02:55:16,110
could have solved them already.

4250
02:55:16,110 --> 02:55:17,520
- That's really cool though.

4251
02:55:17,520 --> 02:55:19,110
Just sort of the possibility,

4252
02:55:19,110 --> 02:55:21,090
the vision of that is really cool.

4253
02:55:21,090 --> 02:55:23,460
Even just, you know, even a hundred thousand people

4254
02:55:23,460 --> 02:55:26,910
were like bring 10,000 together just to...

4255
02:55:26,910 --> 02:55:30,450
I mean there's a reason in the physical world

4256
02:55:30,450 --> 02:55:32,100
when you go to a concert

4257
02:55:32,100 --> 02:55:33,660
and you have all those people around you,

4258
02:55:33,660 --> 02:55:36,420
that energy or you go to a football game,

4259
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:38,790
that energy is unlike anything else.

4260
02:55:38,790 --> 02:55:42,030
And if you can bring that energy to the digital world,

4261
02:55:42,030 --> 02:55:43,320
that's amazing.

4262
02:55:43,320 --> 02:55:44,850
Yeah, but anyway, so sorry.

4263
02:55:44,850 --> 02:55:48,660
So on the technology side of bringing that to life

4264
02:55:48,660 --> 02:55:50,310
on the programming language side,

4265
02:55:51,510 --> 02:55:54,420
can you continue, as I rudely interrupt you

4266
02:55:54,420 --> 02:55:55,860
talking about Verse.

4267
02:55:55,860 --> 02:55:57,900
- Versus the functional logic language

4268
02:55:57,900 --> 02:56:01,410
because we think that's the way to make the most simple

4269
02:56:01,410 --> 02:56:03,843
and powerful language simultaneously.

4270
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:09,000
Back in the 1970s, the programming language designer

4271
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:12,513
who built Pascal, one of the early programming languages,

4272
02:56:13,830 --> 02:56:15,930
Niklaus Wirth or Nicholas Wirth,

4273
02:56:15,930 --> 02:56:19,650
as Americans might call him, stated this principle

4274
02:56:19,650 --> 02:56:21,600
that programming language should achieve

4275
02:56:21,600 --> 02:56:25,260
a high degree of power not by having a lot of features

4276
02:56:25,260 --> 02:56:27,660
but having by having a small number of features

4277
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:31,740
that work together and can be composed together arbitrarily.

4278
02:56:31,740 --> 02:56:34,620
So that you have to learn a relatively small set of things

4279
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:39,300
and then the real knowledge comes as you learn ways

4280
02:56:39,300 --> 02:56:41,880
to combine them to achieve bigger and bigger programs.

4281
02:56:41,880 --> 02:56:43,980
And so, you know, there's long history

4282
02:56:43,980 --> 02:56:45,480
to the field of programming languages,

4283
02:56:45,480 --> 02:56:48,960
but in the 1950s the first programming language designers

4284
02:56:48,960 --> 02:56:51,060
got together and built the first standardized language

4285
02:56:51,060 --> 02:56:52,050
called ALGOL.

4286
02:56:52,050 --> 02:56:54,960
And there was this meeting in 1956,

4287
02:56:54,960 --> 02:56:56,430
very few people even know about,

4288
02:56:56,430 --> 02:56:58,350
but it's where all the major foundations

4289
02:56:58,350 --> 02:57:01,053
of modern programming languages were decided on.

4290
02:57:01,053 --> 02:57:03,390
That the C family of languages inherited.

4291
02:57:03,390 --> 02:57:04,683
And so we're very much living in a world

4292
02:57:04,683 --> 02:57:06,720
that was defined by them.

4293
02:57:06,720 --> 02:57:08,970
And thankfully they got a whole lot of things right.

4294
02:57:08,970 --> 02:57:11,220
They defined how functions should work,

4295
02:57:11,220 --> 02:57:13,710
how variable should work and how recursion should work.

4296
02:57:13,710 --> 02:57:16,077
And you know, thank God they got those things right

4297
02:57:16,077 --> 02:57:18,150
but they got a few things wrong

4298
02:57:18,150 --> 02:57:20,220
and Verse is trying to fix those.

4299
02:57:20,220 --> 02:57:22,440
And that's the functional logic part of it.

4300
02:57:22,440 --> 02:57:25,110
The interesting thing about functional logic language

4301
02:57:25,110 --> 02:57:27,840
is that in an old school language

4302
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:29,523
an expression produces a value.

4303
02:57:30,390 --> 02:57:31,770
In a functional logic language,

4304
02:57:31,770 --> 02:57:35,430
an expression can produce zero, one or multiple values.

4305
02:57:35,430 --> 02:57:37,680
If it produces zero values, we might say it fails.

4306
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:39,780
If it produces one value, we say it succeeds.

4307
02:57:39,780 --> 02:57:41,790
And if it produces multiple values, it's kind

4308
02:57:41,790 --> 02:57:44,940
providing a set of values you could iterate over.

4309
02:57:44,940 --> 02:57:46,560
And so there are a bunch of features

4310
02:57:46,560 --> 02:57:49,020
in today's programming languages that were defined

4311
02:57:49,020 --> 02:57:51,540
in an ad hoc way without really thinking this through

4312
02:57:51,540 --> 02:57:53,820
this zero, one or many values way.

4313
02:57:53,820 --> 02:57:54,840
And that's the problem

4314
02:57:54,840 --> 02:57:57,270
that functional logic languages address.

4315
02:57:57,270 --> 02:57:58,590
The most basic example,

4316
02:57:58,590 --> 02:58:01,020
an if statement in a programming language.

4317
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:03,720
If some condition holds, then do this thing,

4318
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:05,760
otherwise do that thing.

4319
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:09,420
And in the language today this is done with variables

4320
02:58:09,420 --> 02:58:12,660
of type boolean or expressions that produce booleans.

4321
02:58:12,660 --> 02:58:16,650
We have boolean variables that are either true or false.

4322
02:58:16,650 --> 02:58:18,780
We have expressions that evaluate to boolens.

4323
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:20,550
And so you can express a condition

4324
02:58:20,550 --> 02:58:22,770
as a bunch of these features together,

4325
02:58:22,770 --> 02:58:25,330
but you've lost any computation you've done

4326
02:58:26,370 --> 02:58:28,380
in doing that boolen expression evaluation.

4327
02:58:28,380 --> 02:58:30,600
So in a functional logic language,

4328
02:58:30,600 --> 02:58:32,850
your condition wouldn't do that.

4329
02:58:32,850 --> 02:58:34,020
It would either succeed

4330
02:58:34,020 --> 02:58:36,120
and produce a value or it would fail.

4331
02:58:36,120 --> 02:58:38,760
If it succeeds, it goes to then branch,

4332
02:58:38,760 --> 02:58:40,770
your operation succeeded. now you're operating, you know,

4333
02:58:40,770 --> 02:58:42,090
running this one batch of code.

4334
02:58:42,090 --> 02:58:43,920
And if your expression failed

4335
02:58:43,920 --> 02:58:45,870
then you go to the else branch.

4336
02:58:45,870 --> 02:58:48,540
But the exciting thing about that is your expression

4337
02:58:48,540 --> 02:58:51,480
that succeeds or fails can produce values

4338
02:58:51,480 --> 02:58:54,210
and bind variables that are then accessed

4339
02:58:54,210 --> 02:58:55,410
by the then branch.

4340
02:58:55,410 --> 02:58:57,720
So you can write a conditional where you can only get

4341
02:58:57,720 --> 02:59:00,150
to the inside of the condition the then

4342
02:59:00,150 --> 02:59:02,310
if a bunch of variables have successfully

4343
02:59:02,310 --> 02:59:03,330
been bound to variables.

4344
02:59:03,330 --> 02:59:05,250
So it lets you test if some conditions hold

4345
02:59:05,250 --> 02:59:08,040
and then use the results of those tests.

4346
02:59:08,040 --> 02:59:11,520
And that gives you a much higher level of reliability.

4347
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:15,120
And then a for loop in a traditional language,

4348
02:59:15,120 --> 02:59:17,640
it's just a bunch of imperative code that's woven together

4349
02:59:17,640 --> 02:59:20,490
to produce a bunch of values iteratively.

4350
02:59:20,490 --> 02:59:23,040
It's rather awkward to do complicated things in for loops.

4351
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:25,290
And so you often end up with either ever more complicated

4352
02:59:25,290 --> 02:59:26,910
constructs built to work around that,

4353
02:59:26,910 --> 02:59:28,653
like iterators and other things.

4354
02:59:29,536 --> 02:59:30,720
The idea of functional logic languages

4355
02:59:30,720 --> 02:59:34,110
is your for loop can just produce multiple values

4356
02:59:34,110 --> 02:59:35,610
and if it produces zero values

4357
02:59:35,610 --> 02:59:37,350
you got to reiterate zero iterations.

4358
02:59:37,350 --> 02:59:38,640
And it produces a bunch of values,

4359
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:41,130
you got all of those as your iterations.

4360
02:59:41,130 --> 02:59:43,110
Rather than having a bunch of nested loops,

4361
02:59:43,110 --> 02:59:44,197
you can write arbitrary things

4362
02:59:44,197 --> 02:59:47,970
that look like SQL queries in a condition

4363
02:59:47,970 --> 02:59:50,580
or in a for loop that bind a bunch of variables,

4364
02:59:50,580 --> 02:59:53,700
do a bunch of tests, produce a series of results

4365
02:59:53,700 --> 02:59:55,680
and in some order that you're iterating over

4366
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:59,730
and then you can handle all of them and produce a result.

4367
02:59:59,730 --> 03:00:02,130
So you kind of gain the power of SQL queries,

4368
03:00:02,130 --> 03:00:05,400
you know, large complex queries over data structures

4369
03:00:05,400 --> 03:00:07,950
in a language that is much simpler

4370
03:00:07,950 --> 03:00:10,230
in which your code is just performing

4371
03:00:10,230 --> 03:00:12,090
simple iterative operations.

4372
03:00:12,090 --> 03:00:14,370
And so it kind of gives you the best of databases

4373
03:00:14,370 --> 03:00:18,090
and of regular programming in a much more uniform way.

4374
03:00:18,090 --> 03:00:20,970
And the power of this is now users can write functions

4375
03:00:20,970 --> 03:00:23,160
that not only produce a value,

4376
03:00:23,160 --> 03:00:24,720
you can write functions that might fail.

4377
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:27,330
And so you can write a function that answers a question.

4378
03:00:27,330 --> 03:00:31,800
The answer can be either a yes and my value is this or no.

4379
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:35,130
And you can combine these together into arbitrary queries.

4380
03:00:35,130 --> 03:00:37,230
And if you like, the funny thing

4381
03:00:37,230 --> 03:00:39,150
is that this is not how C++ works.

4382
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:42,537
And so when we have Epic programmers moving over from C++

4383
03:00:42,537 --> 03:00:44,100
and writing their first Verse code,

4384
03:00:44,100 --> 03:00:46,320
they try to write C++ code and versatile

4385
03:00:46,320 --> 03:00:49,470
and it actually ends up being convoluted code

4386
03:00:49,470 --> 03:00:52,413
that's worse than good C++ or good Verse.

4387
03:00:53,700 --> 03:00:55,230
But after a few months they get up to speed

4388
03:00:55,230 --> 03:00:56,880
and they're writing really awesome code that's tighter

4389
03:00:56,880 --> 03:00:58,710
and more compact than before

4390
03:00:58,710 --> 03:01:00,960
and with users who've never programmed before

4391
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:02,952
but are learning programming for the first time

4392
03:01:02,952 --> 03:01:06,870
in the context of "Fortnite," it's really fascinating.

4393
03:01:06,870 --> 03:01:10,110
You see these users are learning this kind of as

4394
03:01:10,110 --> 03:01:11,700
it becomes their intuition.

4395
03:01:11,700 --> 03:01:13,350
They just assume programming works this way

4396
03:01:13,350 --> 03:01:15,630
and they're writing way more advanced

4397
03:01:15,630 --> 03:01:17,730
and interesting for loops and conditions

4398
03:01:17,730 --> 03:01:19,380
than we're often writing internally

4399
03:01:19,380 --> 03:01:21,870
because they've kind of rocked the core concept.

4400
03:01:21,870 --> 03:01:24,330
- Yeah, I mean you said a lot of really interesting stuff.

4401
03:01:24,330 --> 03:01:25,650
First of all, it's very interesting

4402
03:01:25,650 --> 03:01:26,743
that there's a bunch of people,

4403
03:01:26,743 --> 03:01:29,110
a lot of people learning programming

4404
03:01:30,150 --> 03:01:32,670
for the first time with Verse,

4405
03:01:32,670 --> 03:01:36,030
which is a very different way to look at programming

4406
03:01:36,030 --> 03:01:39,420
and some deep sense as you're saying,

4407
03:01:39,420 --> 03:01:41,850
a very intuitive way to learn programming.

4408
03:01:41,850 --> 03:01:44,310
But there's a lot of properties about this being

4409
03:01:44,310 --> 03:01:45,963
a logical language,

4410
03:01:46,860 --> 03:01:51,657
one of which will maybe speak also about confluence

4411
03:01:52,590 --> 03:01:55,530
but also correctness.

4412
03:01:55,530 --> 03:01:59,320
So being able to prove the correctness of a code

4413
03:02:01,148 --> 03:02:05,433
is basically easier to write bug free code.

4414
03:02:06,570 --> 03:02:07,587
Can you just speak to that

4415
03:02:07,587 --> 03:02:09,570
and the importance of that

4416
03:02:09,570 --> 03:02:12,690
when you're building the metaverse?

4417
03:02:12,690 --> 03:02:15,180
- Yeah, right, so the challenge with the metaverse

4418
03:02:15,180 --> 03:02:18,240
is first of all that it's a huge base of code

4419
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:21,030
that's evolving over time and written by many authors.

4420
03:02:21,030 --> 03:02:23,820
So you might see every second a new module is updated

4421
03:02:23,820 --> 03:02:26,220
somewhere and you expect in this live ever running

4422
03:02:26,220 --> 03:02:28,680
simulation that never shuts down for everything

4423
03:02:28,680 --> 03:02:30,393
to upgrade live in place.

4424
03:02:31,320 --> 03:02:34,810
And so one critical component that is the ability to

4425
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:38,580
release an update to something you've already published

4426
03:02:38,580 --> 03:02:41,520
and be sure that it's backwards compatible with the one

4427
03:02:41,520 --> 03:02:43,530
that you've already released.

4428
03:02:43,530 --> 03:02:45,750
And that's essentially a type checking problem,

4429
03:02:45,750 --> 03:02:48,060
checking that your new interface is backwards compatible

4430
03:02:48,060 --> 03:02:48,960
with your old one.

4431
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:51,570
And that comes down to the type system of the language.

4432
03:02:51,570 --> 03:02:53,730
There's been a lot of very interesting research

4433
03:02:53,730 --> 03:02:56,850
on type systems over the years, most of which

4434
03:02:56,850 --> 03:02:58,230
hasn't ever made it

4435
03:02:58,230 --> 03:03:01,230
into the C++ programming language unfortunately.

4436
03:03:01,230 --> 03:03:04,260
But you see several branches of that whole field.

4437
03:03:04,260 --> 03:03:06,390
One of the really interesting things that Java

4438
03:03:06,390 --> 03:03:09,090
and C# did in the early days and then later abandoned

4439
03:03:09,090 --> 03:03:11,730
and didn't bother update was defining a very rigorous

4440
03:03:11,730 --> 03:03:14,850
set of rules for if you publish a module

4441
03:03:14,850 --> 03:03:17,460
with one set of types today,

4442
03:03:17,460 --> 03:03:20,070
then what changes can you make to that module

4443
03:03:20,070 --> 03:03:21,570
for your future updates to it

4444
03:03:21,570 --> 03:03:24,090
that don't break backwards compatibility.

4445
03:03:24,090 --> 03:03:25,560
And that's a problem for type checking.

4446
03:03:25,560 --> 03:03:27,330
You know like say you have a function that promises

4447
03:03:27,330 --> 03:03:30,180
to return some integer, when in the future you could say

4448
03:03:30,180 --> 03:03:31,560
that returns some natural number

4449
03:03:31,560 --> 03:03:32,910
'cause every natural number is an integer.

4450
03:03:32,910 --> 03:03:34,380
So that's a backwards compatible change.

4451
03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:36,030
But you can't say it returns a rational number

4452
03:03:36,030 --> 03:03:38,280
'cause some rational numbers are not integers.

4453
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:40,650
So the, you know, system ought

4454
03:03:40,650 --> 03:03:42,153
to reject that kind of change.

4455
03:03:43,470 --> 03:03:45,540
But the much, much, much more interesting thing

4456
03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:47,640
about type checking, it was the realization

4457
03:03:47,640 --> 03:03:49,290
it was actually made in the 1930s

4458
03:03:50,253 --> 03:03:53,040
that if you design a programming language type system

4459
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:57,510
in a very particular way, then it becomes not only useful

4460
03:03:57,510 --> 03:03:59,373
for expressing types of variables.

4461
03:04:00,990 --> 03:04:03,180
A traditional thing every type system does is say

4462
03:04:03,180 --> 03:04:05,610
like variable X is of type integer.

4463
03:04:05,610 --> 03:04:08,130
But if you design a type system in a certain way,

4464
03:04:08,130 --> 03:04:10,770
then your types can express theorems

4465
03:04:10,770 --> 03:04:12,330
like mathematical theorems.

4466
03:04:12,330 --> 03:04:15,330
You know the Pythagorean theorem is a cool one.

4467
03:04:15,330 --> 03:04:17,280
But one theorem you might set of

4468
03:04:17,280 --> 03:04:18,930
in a program is like the theorem

4469
03:04:18,930 --> 03:04:22,350
that this function takes an array of integers

4470
03:04:22,350 --> 03:04:24,240
and returns an array of the same integers

4471
03:04:24,240 --> 03:04:26,520
but the result is sorted.

4472
03:04:26,520 --> 03:04:28,710
If you express that as a theorem

4473
03:04:28,710 --> 03:04:31,410
and you follow this system of type theory,

4474
03:04:31,410 --> 03:04:34,680
then you can actually require that anybody who writes

4475
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:36,180
that sorting function to prove

4476
03:04:36,180 --> 03:04:38,250
that it has actually sorted its result.

4477
03:04:38,250 --> 03:04:40,590
And so you have types or theorems

4478
03:04:40,590 --> 03:04:42,840
and values constructed a certain way

4479
03:04:42,840 --> 03:04:45,447
can be proofs of those theorems.

4480
03:04:45,447 --> 03:04:47,790
And, you know, nowadays in mathematical literature

4481
03:04:47,790 --> 03:04:49,140
you see more and more theorems

4482
03:04:49,140 --> 03:04:51,240
are being proven mechanically.

4483
03:04:51,240 --> 03:04:52,773
Mathematicians are proving theorems in a way

4484
03:04:52,773 --> 03:04:56,250
that is verified by computer to be a correct proof.

4485
03:04:56,250 --> 03:04:58,320
In the old days of math, people would write down

4486
03:04:58,320 --> 03:04:59,400
like language.

4487
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:01,410
If you look at all of Euclid's theorems,

4488
03:05:01,410 --> 03:05:02,580
it was just language.

4489
03:05:02,580 --> 03:05:04,410
It was just writing an ancient Greek

4490
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:05,790
to say the steps of the proof

4491
03:05:05,790 --> 03:05:08,280
to convince the reader that the thing is true.

4492
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:09,930
Starting in the 1930s,

4493
03:05:09,930 --> 03:05:12,780
mathematicians move towards rigorous formal proofs

4494
03:05:12,780 --> 03:05:15,570
in which there's a series of steps

4495
03:05:15,570 --> 03:05:18,150
that can be mechanically verified, they're proving things.

4496
03:05:18,150 --> 03:05:19,830
And when mathematicians say

4497
03:05:19,830 --> 03:05:22,800
they've done a computer proof of a theorem,

4498
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:24,330
what they really mean is they've written

4499
03:05:24,330 --> 03:05:25,710
the program in a proof language.

4500
03:05:25,710 --> 03:05:28,285
Like Lean is theorem prover

4501
03:05:28,285 --> 03:05:30,840
a Coq is theorem prover and there are several others.

4502
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:33,093
It means they've written a mechanical proof in that language

4503
03:05:33,093 --> 03:05:38,093
that a computer is checked so that it's impossible to lie.

4504
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:40,560
If you say that you've proven a thing

4505
03:05:40,560 --> 03:05:43,713
and the computer verifies it, then it's definitely true.

4506
03:05:44,910 --> 03:05:46,260
And you know, this is a feature

4507
03:05:46,260 --> 03:05:47,820
of mathematical proof languages

4508
03:05:47,820 --> 03:05:49,620
but it's also I think an idea

4509
03:05:49,620 --> 03:05:51,720
that's making its way into programming language

4510
03:05:51,720 --> 03:05:53,340
is gradually over time.

4511
03:05:53,340 --> 03:05:54,420
And our aim for Verse is

4512
03:05:54,420 --> 03:05:56,670
to be the first mainstream programming language

4513
03:05:56,670 --> 03:05:59,740
that fully adopts that approach and that technique

4514
03:06:00,690 --> 03:06:01,710
and not only adopts it

4515
03:06:01,710 --> 03:06:03,630
but adopts it in a way that's really user friendly.

4516
03:06:03,630 --> 03:06:05,640
So you don't have to do that.

4517
03:06:05,640 --> 03:06:07,140
And the idea of this is

4518
03:06:07,140 --> 03:06:08,970
that you want gradually more information

4519
03:06:08,970 --> 03:06:12,570
to be incorporated in the types of variables.

4520
03:06:12,570 --> 03:06:14,640
The property you want of a programming language is

4521
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:17,610
that if your compiler accepts your program and doesn't beep

4522
03:06:17,610 --> 03:06:19,470
and tell you there is an error,

4523
03:06:19,470 --> 03:06:21,210
then your program should work.

4524
03:06:21,210 --> 03:06:23,760
Now there are all kinds of ways humans

4525
03:06:23,760 --> 03:06:25,140
can make mistakes there

4526
03:06:25,140 --> 03:06:27,000
so that we'll never achieve that ideal,

4527
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,340
but we can get closer and closer to it by having more

4528
03:06:29,340 --> 03:06:32,220
and more language features that enable the compiler

4529
03:06:32,220 --> 03:06:34,140
to catch more human coding errors

4530
03:06:34,140 --> 03:06:36,033
and tell the user what went wrong.

4531
03:06:37,530 --> 03:06:39,150
And you know, that becomes extremely important

4532
03:06:39,150 --> 03:06:42,090
in the metaverse, the cost of fixing a bug

4533
03:06:42,090 --> 03:06:45,750
that's made it through to a runtime and is in users' hands.

4534
03:06:45,750 --> 03:06:49,410
The cost of fixing a bug in a shipping program is

4535
03:06:49,410 --> 03:06:50,460
hundreds of times higher

4536
03:06:50,460 --> 03:06:52,860
than fixing a bug that you've just observed

4537
03:06:52,860 --> 03:06:54,710
as you're running your code yourself.

4538
03:06:55,620 --> 03:06:56,610
When it's running on your computer,

4539
03:06:56,610 --> 03:06:59,550
you just fix a line of code and your bugs fixed.

4540
03:06:59,550 --> 03:07:01,740
When you have to fix it live, you have to release a patch,

4541
03:07:01,740 --> 03:07:02,940
you have to release patch notes,

4542
03:07:02,940 --> 03:07:04,770
you have to test the patch, you have to check

4543
03:07:04,770 --> 03:07:06,450
for all the other bugs that might have been introduced

4544
03:07:06,450 --> 03:07:09,390
and everything becomes vastly, vastly more expensive.

4545
03:07:09,390 --> 03:07:11,550
So you know, the real aim of the Verse program

4546
03:07:11,550 --> 03:07:14,880
and approach is to catch all of these errors at compile time

4547
03:07:14,880 --> 03:07:18,060
and make the metaverse a very reliable place.

4548
03:07:18,060 --> 03:07:20,940
- Do you see a world where like at compile time

4549
03:07:20,940 --> 03:07:23,390
you could prove that the program is correct

4550
03:07:23,390 --> 03:07:25,350
in some sense of correctness?

4551
03:07:25,350 --> 03:07:27,810
- Proving things becomes commentorially harder

4552
03:07:27,810 --> 03:07:28,797
as they get larger, right?

4553
03:07:28,797 --> 03:07:30,690
And so the really important thing

4554
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:34,140
about this whole field is that you should be able

4555
03:07:34,140 --> 03:07:36,180
to adopt these capabilities gradually

4556
03:07:36,180 --> 03:07:37,920
and apply it where you really need it.

4557
03:07:37,920 --> 03:07:39,690
Like if you're writing something

4558
03:07:39,690 --> 03:07:41,250
like a cryptography algorithm,

4559
03:07:41,250 --> 03:07:43,500
that's a good place to prove stuff.

4560
03:07:43,500 --> 03:07:45,600
If you're writing a data decompressor that's gonna be used

4561
03:07:45,600 --> 03:07:48,750
by an entire ecosystem, like proving that

4562
03:07:48,750 --> 03:07:51,960
that doesn't overrun memory, it's actually really important.

4563
03:07:51,960 --> 03:07:53,010
And a lot of the reason

4564
03:07:53,010 --> 03:07:54,930
that security vulnerabilities happen today

4565
03:07:54,930 --> 03:07:58,170
is because in a different language a compiler

4566
03:07:58,170 --> 03:08:01,320
could have caught, we're not caught in C

4567
03:08:01,320 --> 03:08:03,423
because it just doesn't have this feature.

4568
03:08:04,380 --> 03:08:06,180
But yet we shouldn't see this as scary.

4569
03:08:06,180 --> 03:08:08,100
Everybody working in a type language like C

4570
03:08:08,100 --> 03:08:12,960
or C # or Java is proving theorems all the time.

4571
03:08:12,960 --> 03:08:14,217
If you have a variable of type integer

4572
03:08:14,217 --> 03:08:16,440
and you assign some value to it, you've proven

4573
03:08:16,440 --> 03:08:18,990
to the compiler that value was an integer

4574
03:08:18,990 --> 03:08:20,910
'cause otherwise it would've rejected it.

4575
03:08:20,910 --> 03:08:24,120
And so, you know, as we add more and more advanced proofs,

4576
03:08:24,120 --> 03:08:27,660
we'll get compositional properties flying out of our systems

4577
03:08:27,660 --> 03:08:31,323
that they're easy to use and you know, people prefer to use.

4578
03:08:32,349 --> 03:08:33,330
And we might think in a future

4579
03:08:33,330 --> 03:08:36,483
where we have AI helping us write certain kinds of code.

4580
03:08:37,335 --> 03:08:39,090
The big problem with AI is you ask it to do something

4581
03:08:39,090 --> 03:08:42,360
and ask you to write a fragment of code that does something,

4582
03:08:42,360 --> 03:08:44,490
it might give you a perfectly valid fragment of code

4583
03:08:44,490 --> 03:08:46,440
that compiles but does the wrong thing.

4584
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:50,490
And if we had languages where you could say,

4585
03:08:50,490 --> 03:08:53,310
write a function that sorts these disarray

4586
03:08:53,310 --> 03:08:56,790
and prove that it did that it could actually write the proof

4587
03:08:56,790 --> 03:09:00,150
and you could, if the compiler didn't beep with it,

4588
03:09:00,150 --> 03:09:02,310
you could trust it was actually sorting the array

4589
03:09:02,310 --> 03:09:04,236
and otherwise you could go back to the AI

4590
03:09:04,236 --> 03:09:05,700
and say, well that didn't work.

4591
03:09:05,700 --> 03:09:07,173
But you know, getting to the point where we know

4592
03:09:07,173 --> 03:09:09,930
that our programs do what we say they're going to do

4593
03:09:09,930 --> 03:09:12,600
or think they're going to do is a very important thing.

4594
03:09:12,600 --> 03:09:15,150
- And by the way, I should mention that you sent me a note

4595
03:09:15,150 --> 03:09:17,160
about Curry-Howard correspondence,

4596
03:09:17,160 --> 03:09:18,630
which I went down a rabbit hole

4597
03:09:18,630 --> 03:09:21,810
and that's a whole fascinating field which shows

4598
03:09:21,810 --> 03:09:25,170
the mathematical relationship between programs and proofs.

4599
03:09:25,170 --> 03:09:27,420
- That's right, this is a result from the 1930s.

4600
03:09:27,420 --> 03:09:30,870
It's one of the most important results of computer science

4601
03:09:30,870 --> 03:09:32,940
that almost nobody knows about.

4602
03:09:32,940 --> 03:09:36,180
But they did this rigorous breakdown of type systems

4603
03:09:36,180 --> 03:09:39,510
and the 1930s formulation of programming

4604
03:09:39,510 --> 03:09:44,510
and established that everything you can prove

4605
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,790
in mathematical logic you can prove within a type system

4606
03:09:47,790 --> 03:09:49,443
if it has certain features.

4607
03:09:51,060 --> 03:09:53,190
And you know, if you break down what is a proof,

4608
03:09:53,190 --> 03:09:56,340
well a proof that integer exist as some integer,

4609
03:09:56,340 --> 03:09:58,200
like five is a proof that integer exist.

4610
03:09:58,200 --> 03:10:01,017
So when you have, you know, something like var xn

4611
03:10:01,017 --> 03:10:03,120
and you say X equals five, well you're proving

4612
03:10:03,120 --> 03:10:05,280
to the compiler that five is an integer, you know,

4613
03:10:05,280 --> 03:10:06,660
that comes as secondhand nature.

4614
03:10:06,660 --> 03:10:09,358
But you can prove more advanced things.

4615
03:10:09,358 --> 03:10:12,300
You know, if you wanna prove that a pair of things are true,

4616
03:10:12,300 --> 03:10:14,730
that like theorem A is true and theorem B is true,

4617
03:10:14,730 --> 03:10:16,860
then you need to provide a pair of values,

4618
03:10:16,860 --> 03:10:19,500
one that proves theorem A and one that proves theorem B

4619
03:10:19,500 --> 03:10:21,240
and that's the conjunctive law of proofs.

4620
03:10:21,240 --> 03:10:23,250
And there's a disjunctive law too.

4621
03:10:23,250 --> 03:10:26,643
And then there's an implication law for proofs.

4622
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:31,680
And it turns out that's really satisfied by functions.

4623
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:33,330
When you write a function of programming language,

4624
03:10:33,330 --> 03:10:35,070
you're saying if you give me this thing,

4625
03:10:35,070 --> 03:10:36,240
I will give you that thing.

4626
03:10:36,240 --> 03:10:38,220
If you give me a parameter of type something,

4627
03:10:38,220 --> 03:10:40,470
then I'll give you a result of some other type.

4628
03:10:40,470 --> 03:10:42,900
And by writing that function,

4629
03:10:42,900 --> 03:10:44,550
you're proving that given one of these things

4630
03:10:44,550 --> 03:10:45,510
you can produce another thing.

4631
03:10:45,510 --> 03:10:47,220
And that's a proof of an implication.

4632
03:10:47,220 --> 03:10:51,660
And with only like seven laws, you can construct

4633
03:10:51,660 --> 03:10:54,390
all of mathematical logic in a type system.

4634
03:10:54,390 --> 03:10:56,310
And you know, one of the important thing

4635
03:10:56,310 --> 03:10:58,320
for programming language is hasn't been given

4636
03:10:58,320 --> 03:11:01,920
enough attention is some aspects of programming languages

4637
03:11:01,920 --> 03:11:02,970
are just subjective.

4638
03:11:02,970 --> 03:11:04,350
They're just machinations

4639
03:11:04,350 --> 03:11:06,840
of the programming language designer, you know.

4640
03:11:06,840 --> 03:11:08,550
And Guido van Rossum decided

4641
03:11:08,550 --> 03:11:11,610
that Python should support indentation a certain way.

4642
03:11:11,610 --> 03:11:13,170
And you know, as long as you're dealing

4643
03:11:13,170 --> 03:11:15,270
with things like human notation and naming of things,

4644
03:11:15,270 --> 03:11:18,270
there's always going to be that subjective layer.

4645
03:11:18,270 --> 03:11:19,743
But there are other parts of programming languages

4646
03:11:19,743 --> 03:11:23,250
that are not subjective but should be fundamental.

4647
03:11:23,250 --> 03:11:26,520
And when you look at type systems,

4648
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:28,500
there is a way to do type systems

4649
03:11:28,500 --> 03:11:30,057
that gives you mathematical proofs.

4650
03:11:30,057 --> 03:11:32,550
And every other way of type systems

4651
03:11:32,550 --> 03:11:35,850
that doesn't give you mathematical proofs is just worse

4652
03:11:35,850 --> 03:11:37,980
and should ultimately be rejected.

4653
03:11:37,980 --> 03:11:41,050
And so I think one of the jobs of computing is to identify

4654
03:11:41,940 --> 03:11:43,710
what have we actually done right in the past

4655
03:11:43,710 --> 03:11:44,820
and what have we done wrong

4656
03:11:44,820 --> 03:11:46,950
and for everything we've done wrong

4657
03:11:46,950 --> 03:11:48,510
actually going back and fixing it

4658
03:11:48,510 --> 03:11:50,940
otherwise we just keep accumulating so much croft

4659
03:11:50,940 --> 03:11:53,310
that our systems eventually are crushed

4660
03:11:53,310 --> 03:11:54,960
under their own complexity.

4661
03:11:54,960 --> 03:11:57,210
And you know, there've been massive announcements

4662
03:11:57,210 --> 03:11:59,550
of horrible vulnerabilities in software

4663
03:11:59,550 --> 03:12:02,310
and services over the past year.

4664
03:12:02,310 --> 03:12:05,103
You know, turns out like some nation state backdoored

4665
03:12:05,103 --> 03:12:08,610
a bunch of Teleco's surveillance systems for wiretaps,

4666
03:12:08,610 --> 03:12:11,040
like huge problem there.

4667
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:13,080
But you know, ultimately when you break it down

4668
03:12:13,080 --> 03:12:15,210
it's probably because of some buffer overrun

4669
03:12:15,210 --> 03:12:16,320
in some C program.

4670
03:12:16,320 --> 03:12:18,660
Like these decisions about programming languages

4671
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:21,120
have long-term implications.

4672
03:12:21,120 --> 03:12:24,510
- It's really fascinating that in building these systems

4673
03:12:24,510 --> 03:12:26,280
that hundreds of millions of people use,

4674
03:12:26,280 --> 03:12:27,360
you're rethinking about like

4675
03:12:27,360 --> 03:12:29,640
how do you actually build it from first principles?

4676
03:12:29,640 --> 03:12:32,940
So I should mention that Verse's primary design goals,

4677
03:12:32,940 --> 03:12:34,170
it should be simple enough to learn

4678
03:12:34,170 --> 03:12:35,340
as a first time programmer,

4679
03:12:35,340 --> 03:12:38,760
general enough for writing any kind of code and data.

4680
03:12:38,760 --> 03:12:41,130
Productive in the context of building, iterating

4681
03:12:41,130 --> 03:12:44,160
and shipping a project in a team setting.

4682
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:46,650
Statically verified to catch as many categories

4683
03:12:46,650 --> 03:12:48,750
of runtime problems as possible at compile time

4684
03:12:48,750 --> 03:12:49,800
as we were talking about.

4685
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:54,600
Performant for real-time, open-world multiplayer games.

4686
03:12:54,600 --> 03:12:56,460
We didn't really quite talk about performance,

4687
03:12:56,460 --> 03:12:58,680
maybe I could ask you about that in a second.

4688
03:12:58,680 --> 03:12:59,837
Complete so that every feature

4689
03:12:59,837 --> 03:13:02,070
of the language support program are abstraction

4690
03:13:02,070 --> 03:13:03,330
over that feature.

4691
03:13:03,330 --> 03:13:06,090
Timeless, built for the needs of today

4692
03:13:06,090 --> 03:13:08,400
and for foreseeable future needs, yeah.

4693
03:13:08,400 --> 03:13:10,230
And then there's some design goals

4694
03:13:10,230 --> 03:13:13,590
that we talked about that is strongly typed.

4695
03:13:13,590 --> 03:13:15,930
Multi-paradigm to use the best of functional programming,

4696
03:13:15,930 --> 03:13:18,780
object-oriented programming and imperative programming.

4697
03:13:18,780 --> 03:13:21,690
So it's as deterministic as possible.

4698
03:13:21,690 --> 03:13:23,100
You know if you run it over and over,

4699
03:13:23,100 --> 03:13:25,500
it runs in exact same way.

4700
03:13:25,500 --> 03:13:27,390
You know, failable expressions as you talked about.

4701
03:13:27,390 --> 03:13:28,792
It's super fascinating.

4702
03:13:28,792 --> 03:13:30,540
There's so many cool features in this,

4703
03:13:30,540 --> 03:13:33,000
speculative execution, concurrency.

4704
03:13:33,000 --> 03:13:34,560
Maybe can you talk about concurrency?

4705
03:13:34,560 --> 03:13:39,560
Like what is it about Verse that allows for concurrency

4706
03:13:40,050 --> 03:13:41,850
at the scale that you need?

4707
03:13:41,850 --> 03:13:45,150
- This is the one biggest technical problem

4708
03:13:45,150 --> 03:13:49,320
that we're working to solve in this generation

4709
03:13:49,320 --> 03:13:52,590
and that is taming concurrency

4710
03:13:52,590 --> 03:13:55,800
so that any ordinary programmer can achieve it

4711
03:13:55,800 --> 03:13:57,960
by just writing ordinary code.

4712
03:13:57,960 --> 03:13:58,793
- It's hard.

4713
03:13:59,700 --> 03:14:01,440
- Programming on a single threaded computer

4714
03:14:01,440 --> 03:14:03,810
is hard enough but it is completely predictable.

4715
03:14:03,810 --> 03:14:06,240
If you have a language that's deterministic

4716
03:14:06,240 --> 03:14:08,820
and you're on the same code over and over,

4717
03:14:08,820 --> 03:14:10,530
it's always gonna do exactly the same thing

4718
03:14:10,530 --> 03:14:12,060
and there's no unpredictability

4719
03:14:12,060 --> 03:14:13,770
about what might happen, right?

4720
03:14:13,770 --> 03:14:15,750
You're reading and writing variables in some order

4721
03:14:15,750 --> 03:14:19,260
and you're always gonna see it behave the same.

4722
03:14:19,260 --> 03:14:21,180
The problem is when you introduce multiple threads

4723
03:14:21,180 --> 03:14:24,090
or multiple nodes in a data center all working together

4724
03:14:24,090 --> 03:14:26,640
on a single problem, is that they each want to read

4725
03:14:26,640 --> 03:14:28,380
and write different pieces of data

4726
03:14:28,380 --> 03:14:31,260
and change the state of the world as they go.

4727
03:14:31,260 --> 03:14:34,350
And still almost all concurrency

4728
03:14:34,350 --> 03:14:37,563
and real world programs today is achieved manually.

4729
03:14:38,460 --> 03:14:39,930
Programmers are writing this code

4730
03:14:39,930 --> 03:14:43,170
that might run in multiple threads very, very carefully

4731
03:14:43,170 --> 03:14:48,170
so that they are negotiating among each thread to get access

4732
03:14:48,360 --> 03:14:49,920
to data in a way that's going

4733
03:14:49,920 --> 03:14:52,113
to give them predictable results.

4734
03:14:53,760 --> 03:14:55,650
And it's incredibly hard.

4735
03:14:55,650 --> 03:14:59,580
It's so hard that in five generations of Unreal Engine,

4736
03:14:59,580 --> 03:15:01,830
every single generation decided we're not

4737
03:15:01,830 --> 03:15:04,620
going to try to scale up all of our gameplay code

4738
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:06,600
to multiple threads manually.

4739
03:15:06,600 --> 03:15:09,600
It's just much, much, much too likely to go wrong.

4740
03:15:09,600 --> 03:15:12,180
Not only for ourselves, but for every partner company

4741
03:15:12,180 --> 03:15:13,440
who licenses Unreal Engine

4742
03:15:13,440 --> 03:15:14,880
and tries to use it for building a game,

4743
03:15:14,880 --> 03:15:17,850
it's just a massive foot gun.

4744
03:15:17,850 --> 03:15:20,610
There's a variety of solutions to concurrency

4745
03:15:20,610 --> 03:15:23,070
that are all rather suboptimal.

4746
03:15:23,070 --> 03:15:24,453
One attempted solution was like,

4747
03:15:24,453 --> 03:15:26,850
"Oh, just don't try to solve this problem at all.

4748
03:15:26,850 --> 03:15:29,250
Let's break our program down into microservices.

4749
03:15:29,250 --> 03:15:31,530
And almost all online websites have massive scale

4750
03:15:31,530 --> 03:15:35,730
like amazon.com work with the hundreds of microservices

4751
03:15:35,730 --> 03:15:37,590
where different servers negotiate with each other

4752
03:15:37,590 --> 03:15:39,297
by sending messages to each other.

4753
03:15:39,297 --> 03:15:41,640
And by programmers writing those things very carefully,

4754
03:15:41,640 --> 03:15:44,070
they eventually get to being able to take your orders

4755
03:15:44,070 --> 03:15:46,683
and not make a mess of them reliably.

4756
03:15:48,030 --> 03:15:50,820
But you know, this is totally not scalable to the metaverse

4757
03:15:50,820 --> 03:15:52,230
where you have millions of programmers

4758
03:15:52,230 --> 03:15:54,570
who are like mostly not gonna be computer scientists,

4759
03:15:54,570 --> 03:15:56,730
they're mostly gonna be hobbyists and enthusiasts

4760
03:15:56,730 --> 03:15:59,790
and first time programmers doing stuff for fun.

4761
03:15:59,790 --> 03:16:00,990
That's never gonna work for them

4762
03:16:00,990 --> 03:16:02,460
because they'll never be able to envision

4763
03:16:02,460 --> 03:16:03,810
all the different dependencies

4764
03:16:03,810 --> 03:16:07,110
between different computations they're running in parallel.

4765
03:16:07,110 --> 03:16:11,100
But it turns out that there was amazing foundational work

4766
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:11,933
done in the 1980s

4767
03:16:11,933 --> 03:16:15,907
that was made very real by paper on Haskell concurrency

4768
03:16:15,907 --> 03:16:18,867
"Composable Memory Transactions" is the name of the paper.

4769
03:16:18,867 --> 03:16:20,860
And it describes the system for

4770
03:16:21,960 --> 03:16:24,450
transactional updates to programs.

4771
03:16:24,450 --> 03:16:26,470
And the idea of a transaction is

4772
03:16:28,500 --> 03:16:32,130
a transaction is a block of code that does a bunch

4773
03:16:32,130 --> 03:16:34,410
of operations on memory, might read, might write,

4774
03:16:34,410 --> 03:16:36,959
it might process an order, it might accept an order

4775
03:16:36,959 --> 03:16:38,220
and/or reject an order.

4776
03:16:38,220 --> 03:16:39,690
It might transfer money

4777
03:16:39,690 --> 03:16:41,180
between one bank account and another.

4778
03:16:41,180 --> 03:16:43,410
It might make conditional decisions like,

4779
03:16:43,410 --> 03:16:45,570
oh you asked to transfer $100 from your account

4780
03:16:45,570 --> 03:16:48,240
to this guy's account, we're gonna see if you

4781
03:16:48,240 --> 03:16:49,530
have $100.

4782
03:16:49,530 --> 03:16:51,057
If you don't, we're gonna reject it

4783
03:16:51,057 --> 03:16:52,380
and if you have $100,

4784
03:16:52,380 --> 03:16:54,180
we're gonna take $100 out of your account

4785
03:16:54,180 --> 03:16:56,100
and add it to this other guy's account.

4786
03:16:56,100 --> 03:16:58,860
Without transactions, if everybody's just randomly adding

4787
03:16:58,860 --> 03:17:01,110
and subtracting each other's bank balances,

4788
03:17:01,110 --> 03:17:02,940
then you might have somebody read a bank balance,

4789
03:17:02,940 --> 03:17:04,650
subtract a hundred and write it out.

4790
03:17:04,650 --> 03:17:06,630
But in the meantime somebody has out written something else

4791
03:17:06,630 --> 03:17:07,463
in the meantime.

4792
03:17:07,463 --> 03:17:09,990
And so you might get inconsistent bank balances

4793
03:17:09,990 --> 03:17:12,510
arising if you don't have a way of ensuring

4794
03:17:12,510 --> 03:17:14,763
that these all run in a specific order.

4795
03:17:16,500 --> 03:17:17,507
So the idea of transactions is,

4796
03:17:17,507 --> 03:17:20,973
it's a way of dividing an entire program into updates,

4797
03:17:22,050 --> 03:17:24,990
you know, self-contained updates that do an arbitrary amount

4798
03:17:24,990 --> 03:17:28,770
of computation but must run in a single threaded manner.

4799
03:17:28,770 --> 03:17:29,970
And in the case of a game engine,

4800
03:17:29,970 --> 03:17:31,860
that's a gameplay object update.

4801
03:17:31,860 --> 03:17:34,560
When you're playing "Fortnite," you see a gameplay object.

4802
03:17:34,560 --> 03:17:36,180
Every other player is a gameplay object.

4803
03:17:36,180 --> 03:17:37,740
Every enemy is in a gameplay object.

4804
03:17:37,740 --> 03:17:39,780
Every rocket and projectile and car

4805
03:17:39,780 --> 03:17:42,030
and thing you see moving around and interacting.

4806
03:17:42,030 --> 03:17:44,070
It's not just a fixed static part of the world,

4807
03:17:44,070 --> 03:17:46,230
that's a separate game object.

4808
03:17:46,230 --> 03:17:49,380
And each of those objects is updated at, you know,

4809
03:17:49,380 --> 03:17:52,557
a rate of one update per frame at 60 frames per second.

4810
03:17:52,557 --> 03:17:53,820
And so then in the course

4811
03:17:53,820 --> 03:17:55,200
of "Fortnite: Battle Royale" gameplay,

4812
03:17:55,200 --> 03:17:57,750
you have tens of thousands of object updates

4813
03:17:57,750 --> 03:18:00,450
happening every frame with a hundred players.

4814
03:18:00,450 --> 03:18:02,040
In a simulation with billions of players,

4815
03:18:02,040 --> 03:18:04,080
you'd have a whole lot more than that.

4816
03:18:04,080 --> 03:18:05,670
So right now that's done single threaded.

4817
03:18:05,670 --> 03:18:07,860
Yeah that's done single threaded in each game session.

4818
03:18:07,860 --> 03:18:10,920
This is why "Fortnite" is a hundred players limitation.

4819
03:18:10,920 --> 03:18:12,660
If you absolutely maxed out a server,

4820
03:18:12,660 --> 03:18:15,750
maybe today you could get up to 140 or something,

4821
03:18:15,750 --> 03:18:17,070
but, you know, it's not going to thousands

4822
03:18:17,070 --> 03:18:18,840
or millions or billions.

4823
03:18:18,840 --> 03:18:20,490
And so what we need is a technique

4824
03:18:20,490 --> 03:18:24,270
for magically automatically scaling our code to that.

4825
03:18:24,270 --> 03:18:26,100
And transactions are the idea.

4826
03:18:26,100 --> 03:18:28,980
And the idea is a transaction is a granule of code

4827
03:18:28,980 --> 03:18:30,720
that runs its entirety.

4828
03:18:30,720 --> 03:18:33,570
And so the idea of this transactional memory concept

4829
03:18:33,570 --> 03:18:35,520
is that we're gonna have programmers

4830
03:18:35,520 --> 03:18:37,140
write completely ordinary code,

4831
03:18:37,140 --> 03:18:39,900
that reads and writes variables in a completely ordinary way

4832
03:18:39,900 --> 03:18:40,890
and they're not gonna have to worry

4833
03:18:40,890 --> 03:18:42,360
about concurrency at all.

4834
03:18:42,360 --> 03:18:45,210
And then the system, like today a program,

4835
03:18:45,210 --> 03:18:46,560
a computer just runs your program.

4836
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:48,510
There's no amount of speculation going on

4837
03:18:48,510 --> 03:18:50,220
at the programming language level.

4838
03:18:50,220 --> 03:18:51,900
Value of transactions is,

4839
03:18:51,900 --> 03:18:54,500
since we have a bunch of operations we need to know,

4840
03:18:56,150 --> 03:18:59,100
we apply a large set of them concurrently,

4841
03:18:59,100 --> 03:19:00,900
but instead of each one reading and writing

4842
03:19:00,900 --> 03:19:02,850
from global memory shared by all,

4843
03:19:02,850 --> 03:19:05,200
in which case they might be reading and writing

4844
03:19:06,900 --> 03:19:08,970
and contending with each other for the same data

4845
03:19:08,970 --> 03:19:11,430
and might be doing contradictory things to it.

4846
03:19:11,430 --> 03:19:14,553
We're gonna track all of our rights locally.

4847
03:19:16,389 --> 03:19:18,090
We're not gonna write changes out to global memory.

4848
03:19:18,090 --> 03:19:19,830
We're gonna keep track of it in a buffer.

4849
03:19:19,830 --> 03:19:21,930
It's just for that one transaction.

4850
03:19:21,930 --> 03:19:24,540
So it's gonna look to that code exactly

4851
03:19:24,540 --> 03:19:26,310
as if it's running on the global system

4852
03:19:26,310 --> 03:19:28,380
affecting global game state,

4853
03:19:28,380 --> 03:19:30,750
but it's gonna be isolated to just that one transaction

4854
03:19:30,750 --> 03:19:32,370
and it's gonna be set aside

4855
03:19:32,370 --> 03:19:35,520
and buffered up for consideration later.

4856
03:19:35,520 --> 03:19:37,860
We're gonna run tens or hundreds or thousands

4857
03:19:37,860 --> 03:19:39,300
of the updates concurrently.

4858
03:19:39,300 --> 03:19:42,030
We're gonna see which ones had read-write conflicts

4859
03:19:42,030 --> 03:19:44,190
because if two transactions don't read and write

4860
03:19:44,190 --> 03:19:47,310
any of the same data, then you could have run them in

4861
03:19:47,310 --> 03:19:49,590
either order or simultaneously

4862
03:19:49,590 --> 03:19:51,390
and it wouldn't have changed the end result.

4863
03:19:51,390 --> 03:19:52,830
- Yeah, the order doesn't matter.

4864
03:19:52,830 --> 03:19:57,360
This is so fascinating to imagine this kind of system

4865
03:19:57,360 --> 03:19:59,640
arbitrarily concurrent

4866
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:03,750
running millions of updates

4867
03:20:03,750 --> 03:20:06,123
in parallel of gameplay objects.

4868
03:20:07,254 --> 03:20:08,580
That's the thing that enables the thing

4869
03:20:08,580 --> 03:20:10,200
that we're talking about, which is, you know,

4870
03:20:10,200 --> 03:20:12,990
tens of millions of people together in one scene.

4871
03:20:12,990 --> 03:20:14,250
- Yeah, exactly, and the key is

4872
03:20:14,250 --> 03:20:15,960
that you're running these updates speculatively

4873
03:20:15,960 --> 03:20:18,510
and you're not committing their changes to memory

4874
03:20:18,510 --> 03:20:20,910
until you're sure that they're free of conflict.

4875
03:20:20,910 --> 03:20:22,740
So you might update 10,000 objects,

4876
03:20:22,740 --> 03:20:26,220
you might find 9,000 of them were conflict free.

4877
03:20:26,220 --> 03:20:29,530
So you apply those 9,000 updates to memory

4878
03:20:30,750 --> 03:20:32,670
and they could have run in any order

4879
03:20:32,670 --> 03:20:34,716
and it wouldn't have changed the result.

4880
03:20:34,716 --> 03:20:35,549
- [Lex] That's so cool.

4881
03:20:35,549 --> 03:20:36,382
- Now there's a thousand objects left over.

4882
03:20:36,382 --> 03:20:37,215
Now you have to run those again.

4883
03:20:37,215 --> 03:20:40,650
Try them, maybe interleave in a different way to get them

4884
03:20:40,650 --> 03:20:42,720
to eventually commit to memory.

4885
03:20:42,720 --> 03:20:44,520
And in the meantime you just throw

4886
03:20:44,520 --> 03:20:47,760
all their computations away and redo them later.

4887
03:20:47,760 --> 03:20:49,620
And by doing this, like we're moving this

4888
03:20:49,620 --> 03:20:51,090
from being a programming problem

4889
03:20:51,090 --> 03:20:52,350
for the programmer to deal with,

4890
03:20:52,350 --> 03:20:53,820
to being a language problem

4891
03:20:53,820 --> 03:20:56,370
for us language designers to deal with.

4892
03:20:56,370 --> 03:20:59,460
And we're moving a vast amount of pain

4893
03:20:59,460 --> 03:21:01,620
that would be imposed on a million people instead

4894
03:21:01,620 --> 03:21:03,600
to a vast amount of pain

4895
03:21:03,600 --> 03:21:04,640
imposed on a small number of people

4896
03:21:04,640 --> 03:21:07,080
to have to actually make this work.

4897
03:21:07,080 --> 03:21:09,360
- That's amazing, that's really incredible.

4898
03:21:09,360 --> 03:21:11,280
So what's the state of things with Verse

4899
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:14,430
and I guess what you're outlining is if,

4900
03:21:14,430 --> 03:21:17,940
and hopefully it is successful, this would be a big part

4901
03:21:17,940 --> 03:21:20,160
of Unreal Engine 6.

4902
03:21:20,160 --> 03:21:21,330
So what's the timeline?

4903
03:21:21,330 --> 03:21:23,460
Where do we stand today?

4904
03:21:23,460 --> 03:21:25,260
- Well there's a lot going on in parallel.

4905
03:21:25,260 --> 03:21:26,280
The key thing with Verse

4906
03:21:26,280 --> 03:21:29,610
is that we have been specifying like

4907
03:21:29,610 --> 03:21:31,560
what we think is the ultimate version of the language

4908
03:21:31,560 --> 03:21:33,270
with all the features we want.

4909
03:21:33,270 --> 03:21:37,500
Whereas we've been shipping more modest

4910
03:21:37,500 --> 03:21:39,368
versions of language over time

4911
03:21:39,368 --> 03:21:40,800
and we've released dozens of updates

4912
03:21:40,800 --> 03:21:43,203
to it over the past year and a half.

4913
03:21:44,520 --> 03:21:47,250
And the idea is that the shipping version gains

4914
03:21:47,250 --> 03:21:48,630
more and more features over time,

4915
03:21:48,630 --> 03:21:50,730
but each maintaining backwards compatibility

4916
03:21:50,730 --> 03:21:52,890
with old versions and each continuing to improve

4917
03:21:52,890 --> 03:21:55,830
and approach the ultimate version of it as we go.

4918
03:21:55,830 --> 03:21:57,690
And we've been doing this experiment entirely

4919
03:21:57,690 --> 03:22:01,470
within the world of Unreal Editor for "Fortnite" for now.

4920
03:22:01,470 --> 03:22:02,880
We wanna test this and iterate

4921
03:22:02,880 --> 03:22:06,390
with "Fortnite" creators in just the metaverse usage case

4922
03:22:06,390 --> 03:22:08,700
before we make it available to all of our partners

4923
03:22:08,700 --> 03:22:11,550
using Unreal Engine for all of their projects.

4924
03:22:11,550 --> 03:22:14,400
And the idea is to iteratively improve it and build it out.

4925
03:22:14,400 --> 03:22:16,650
'Cause right now UEFN has relatively

4926
03:22:16,650 --> 03:22:18,000
few features for programming.

4927
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:21,240
It needs a lot more and everything we add makes the world

4928
03:22:21,240 --> 03:22:23,340
a much better place for "Fortnite" creators

4929
03:22:23,340 --> 03:22:26,880
and we're adding major, major new APIs every few months

4930
03:22:26,880 --> 03:22:28,620
throughout the course of this year.

4931
03:22:28,620 --> 03:22:30,600
Whereas Unreal Engine licensees

4932
03:22:30,600 --> 03:22:32,430
who are building standalone games

4933
03:22:32,430 --> 03:22:34,710
already have access to the full engine through C++.

4934
03:22:34,710 --> 03:22:37,527
They have massive, massive expectations of an API.

4935
03:22:37,527 --> 03:22:39,720
And so we can't release this to them

4936
03:22:39,720 --> 03:22:42,210
until we've built up all of the essential features

4937
03:22:42,210 --> 03:22:43,350
that they'll need for building

4938
03:22:43,350 --> 03:22:45,090
their game play in the future.

4939
03:22:45,090 --> 03:22:46,590
And so, you know,

4940
03:22:46,590 --> 03:22:48,450
we have these two different tendrils of progress.

4941
03:22:48,450 --> 03:22:50,970
There's Unreal Engine 5 for game developers

4942
03:22:50,970 --> 03:22:52,290
and there's Unreal Engine 5

4943
03:22:52,290 --> 03:22:55,080
targeting the "Fortnite" community.

4944
03:22:55,080 --> 03:22:57,210
And there's different bits of development

4945
03:22:57,210 --> 03:22:59,040
that are only in one area of it,

4946
03:22:59,040 --> 03:22:59,970
there aren't applied to both.

4947
03:22:59,970 --> 03:23:01,587
Like not all of the Unreal Engine 5 features

4948
03:23:01,587 --> 03:23:03,060
are actually available in "Fortnite"

4949
03:23:03,060 --> 03:23:04,980
because some of them we haven't figured out

4950
03:23:04,980 --> 03:23:07,275
or haven't gotten to the point where we can deploy them

4951
03:23:07,275 --> 03:23:10,710
to all seven platforms in a platform independent way.

4952
03:23:10,710 --> 03:23:13,080
And so the place where all of these different

4953
03:23:13,080 --> 03:23:15,900
threads of development come together is Unreal Engine 6.

4954
03:23:15,900 --> 03:23:17,040
And it's a few years away.

4955
03:23:17,040 --> 03:23:19,050
We don't have an exact timeframe

4956
03:23:19,050 --> 03:23:23,220
but you know, we could be seeing preview versions of it

4957
03:23:23,220 --> 03:23:25,440
perhaps two to three years from now

4958
03:23:25,440 --> 03:23:28,020
and we're making continuous progress towards it.

4959
03:23:28,020 --> 03:23:28,920
- So that's really nice.

4960
03:23:28,920 --> 03:23:30,243
So there's this ultimate version of a language

4961
03:23:30,243 --> 03:23:33,000
that you're constantly working on and thinking through.

4962
03:23:33,000 --> 03:23:38,000
Then there's the shipped version of the language

4963
03:23:38,190 --> 03:23:40,230
that's used by a large number of people

4964
03:23:40,230 --> 03:23:42,317
but still in the constrained environment

4965
03:23:42,317 --> 03:23:45,510
of the Unreal Editor for "Fortnite."

4966
03:23:45,510 --> 03:23:47,070
So for the "Fortnite" game.

4967
03:23:47,070 --> 03:23:51,960
And then there awaits the more general

4968
03:23:51,960 --> 03:23:53,830
Unreal Editor, Unreal Engine

4969
03:23:56,194 --> 03:23:58,620
for the lessons learned in the "Fortnite" context

4970
03:23:58,620 --> 03:24:01,200
to be integrated in the more general context

4971
03:24:01,200 --> 03:24:04,440
of creating simulated worlds for all kinds of games,

4972
03:24:04,440 --> 03:24:05,297
including "Fortnite."

4973
03:24:05,297 --> 03:24:06,720
It's a really nice setup

4974
03:24:06,720 --> 03:24:11,040
'cause it's a testing ground of the language in "Fortnite"

4975
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:12,480
and you're keeping an eye on

4976
03:24:12,480 --> 03:24:15,630
what the ultimate thing will look like also,

4977
03:24:15,630 --> 03:24:18,090
necessary to deliver all the features

4978
03:24:18,090 --> 03:24:19,050
that we mentioned, brilliant.

4979
03:24:19,050 --> 03:24:21,240
- You know the aim for UE 6 is to bring

4980
03:24:21,240 --> 03:24:22,980
the best of both worlds together.

4981
03:24:22,980 --> 03:24:24,780
A much easier gameplay programming

4982
03:24:24,780 --> 03:24:27,870
for the "Fortnite" community and for licensees,

4983
03:24:27,870 --> 03:24:32,730
more scalability to large scale simulations of all sorts.

4984
03:24:32,730 --> 03:24:34,560
Greater ease of use, meaning it'll be easier

4985
03:24:34,560 --> 03:24:36,840
to hire programmers who are familiar with

4986
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:38,390
and experienced with the thing,

4987
03:24:39,420 --> 03:24:41,160
but also ensure that every game developer

4988
03:24:41,160 --> 03:24:43,060
has the full deployment capabilities

4989
03:24:44,400 --> 03:24:45,720
so that it can build a game once

4990
03:24:45,720 --> 03:24:46,980
and then ship it anywhere.

4991
03:24:46,980 --> 03:24:49,860
Like the Autumn version of this enables a game developer

4992
03:24:49,860 --> 03:24:51,760
to build a game of any sort

4993
03:24:53,130 --> 03:24:56,036
or simultaneously both ship it into "Fortnite"

4994
03:24:56,036 --> 03:24:58,230
as a "Fortnite" island that players can go into,

4995
03:24:58,230 --> 03:25:00,330
bring their "Fortnite" items and cosmetics

4996
03:25:00,330 --> 03:25:02,370
and interoperate properly

4997
03:25:02,370 --> 03:25:04,920
or ship as a standalone game or both.

4998
03:25:04,920 --> 03:25:06,840
And if they ship as a standalone game,

4999
03:25:06,840 --> 03:25:08,760
they shouldn't be missing out on the, you know,

5000
03:25:08,760 --> 03:25:09,990
open economy either

5001
03:25:09,990 --> 03:25:12,540
because in this timeframe we'll have opened up

5002
03:25:12,540 --> 03:25:13,860
the "Fortnite" item economy

5003
03:25:13,860 --> 03:25:16,980
to third party developers of all sort.

5004
03:25:16,980 --> 03:25:18,390
Hopefully there is standards body,

5005
03:25:18,390 --> 03:25:20,400
but there might be multiple phases of it

5006
03:25:20,400 --> 03:25:23,670
so that if you choose to ship a standalone game

5007
03:25:23,670 --> 03:25:25,830
you can still choose to, you know,

5008
03:25:25,830 --> 03:25:27,420
have "Fortnite" items work in your game

5009
03:25:27,420 --> 03:25:29,100
and have your game items work in "Fortnite"

5010
03:25:29,100 --> 03:25:31,080
and have your item economy integrated

5011
03:25:31,080 --> 03:25:33,580
with the overall metaverse economy

5012
03:25:35,117 --> 03:25:37,410
and solve the really core problem of the game industry

5013
03:25:37,410 --> 03:25:39,030
that Matthew Ball has been documenting

5014
03:25:39,030 --> 03:25:40,230
over the past few years.

5015
03:25:40,230 --> 03:25:42,960
- Yeah, by the way, Matthew Ball has been really helpful.

5016
03:25:42,960 --> 03:25:44,040
He wrote a really great book

5017
03:25:44,040 --> 03:25:46,260
that I recommend people check out.

5018
03:25:46,260 --> 03:25:48,090
There's an updated version.

5019
03:25:48,090 --> 03:25:49,920
Let me just ask for, 'cause again, there's a bunch

5020
03:25:49,920 --> 03:25:51,390
of indie developers listening to this.

5021
03:25:51,390 --> 03:25:55,440
I saw that a lot of solo developers out there,

5022
03:25:55,440 --> 03:25:56,700
they're using Unreal Engine

5023
03:25:56,700 --> 03:25:59,283
that they're basically creating video games solo.

5024
03:26:02,261 --> 03:26:06,150
I can highly recommend it's great, "Choo-Choo Charles,"

5025
03:26:06,150 --> 03:26:08,190
it's a great video game. (laughs)

5026
03:26:08,190 --> 03:26:11,520
Gavin Eisenbeisz, a great guy.

5027
03:26:11,520 --> 03:26:15,750
He's solo created this game that's I think quite popular.

5028
03:26:15,750 --> 03:26:18,300
I believe he says he used visual,

5029
03:26:18,300 --> 03:26:19,710
he didn't even use C++.

5030
03:26:19,710 --> 03:26:22,860
He used visual scripting, he used blueprints to create it.

5031
03:26:22,860 --> 03:26:24,960
Okay, so I mean all that to say

5032
03:26:24,960 --> 03:26:25,980
people should go check it out,

5033
03:26:25,980 --> 03:26:27,900
support indie developer, support Gavin,

5034
03:26:27,900 --> 03:26:30,070
support everybody like that.

5035
03:26:30,070 --> 03:26:30,903
I think it's important to say

5036
03:26:30,903 --> 03:26:34,290
'cause there's so much genius and artistry out there

5037
03:26:34,290 --> 03:26:37,920
that we wanna support the crazy dreamers out there.

5038
03:26:37,920 --> 03:26:42,870
Anyway, all that to say, what are the ways you think Epic

5039
03:26:42,870 --> 03:26:45,270
can support indie developers like that?

5040
03:26:45,270 --> 03:26:48,510
People like Gavin, like give them superpowers

5041
03:26:48,510 --> 03:26:52,380
to create games from which they can make at the very least

5042
03:26:52,380 --> 03:26:55,683
enough money that they can keep doing their art.

5043
03:26:56,580 --> 03:26:59,430
- Yeah, well that's really about productivity

5044
03:26:59,430 --> 03:27:02,250
because to be successful with a game,

5045
03:27:02,250 --> 03:27:03,750
you have to have a great game.

5046
03:27:06,102 --> 03:27:07,140
If you're building a type of game

5047
03:27:07,140 --> 03:27:08,790
that nobody's ever built before, you might be able

5048
03:27:08,790 --> 03:27:10,950
to build a smaller, simpler game than if you're competing

5049
03:27:10,950 --> 03:27:14,190
in a massive genre that has huge expectations.

5050
03:27:14,190 --> 03:27:16,080
But it's all about enabling somebody to do that

5051
03:27:16,080 --> 03:27:17,910
in a reasonable amount of time that they can spend

5052
03:27:17,910 --> 03:27:19,440
and to be able to finish it and chip it

5053
03:27:19,440 --> 03:27:21,270
and maintain it successfully.

5054
03:27:21,270 --> 03:27:22,590
The tools are a big part of that.

5055
03:27:22,590 --> 03:27:24,890
Having the tools be as productive as possible.

5056
03:27:25,809 --> 03:27:27,180
But there are a lot of other facets as well.

5057
03:27:27,180 --> 03:27:29,673
Like having a content marketplace is a big thing.

5058
03:27:30,840 --> 03:27:33,960
You know, just off the shelf piles of content, some free,

5059
03:27:33,960 --> 03:27:36,630
some paid built by other creators

5060
03:27:36,630 --> 03:27:40,450
can enable a small indie team to build a big game

5061
03:27:41,370 --> 03:27:43,770
and just be able to focus on the unique content of the game.

5062
03:27:43,770 --> 03:27:45,630
Being able to write their gameplay

5063
03:27:45,630 --> 03:27:47,400
and lay out their environments the way they want,

5064
03:27:47,400 --> 03:27:50,160
but not have to build every tree and rock.

5065
03:27:50,160 --> 03:27:51,900
Yeah, because somebody's already built one

5066
03:27:51,900 --> 03:27:55,170
and there's is probably like, you know, perfectly suitable

5067
03:27:55,170 --> 03:27:56,580
for your game.

5068
03:27:56,580 --> 03:27:58,599
And over time there'll be more and more.

5069
03:27:58,599 --> 03:28:00,900
You know, there's also a lot of indie developers

5070
03:28:00,900 --> 03:28:02,460
living as content creators.

5071
03:28:02,460 --> 03:28:04,650
They'll be releasing content on Fab marketplace

5072
03:28:04,650 --> 03:28:07,710
or the Unity Asset Store and earn living for that.

5073
03:28:07,710 --> 03:28:09,570
But specialization of labor

5074
03:28:09,570 --> 03:28:11,550
is a really, really valuable thing.

5075
03:28:11,550 --> 03:28:12,383
In the early days,

5076
03:28:12,383 --> 03:28:14,160
pretty much one person would build one game.

5077
03:28:14,160 --> 03:28:16,860
Like that's how a lot of the games were built in the 1980s.

5078
03:28:16,860 --> 03:28:18,180
Over time you had a separation

5079
03:28:18,180 --> 03:28:20,940
where artists became specialized and then programmers

5080
03:28:20,940 --> 03:28:22,920
and then gameplay programmers and engine programmers.

5081
03:28:22,920 --> 03:28:24,220
Now you have technical artists

5082
03:28:24,220 --> 03:28:26,400
and you have, you know, dozens of different specialties

5083
03:28:26,400 --> 03:28:29,610
contributing to a AAA 3D game now.

5084
03:28:29,610 --> 03:28:33,390
And the more we can modularize those bits of content

5085
03:28:33,390 --> 03:28:35,730
so you could get something off the shelf

5086
03:28:35,730 --> 03:28:38,640
rather than having to build it or have to com,

5087
03:28:38,640 --> 03:28:41,340
you know, engine synthesize it for you,

5088
03:28:41,340 --> 03:28:43,680
the more we can enable creators

5089
03:28:43,680 --> 03:28:46,200
to create stuff fast and successfully.

5090
03:28:46,200 --> 03:28:49,140
- So we should talk about the fact

5091
03:28:49,140 --> 03:28:51,240
that amongst many other things you've been

5092
03:28:54,510 --> 03:28:57,870
philosophically and spiritually battling monopolies

5093
03:28:57,870 --> 03:28:58,703
in general.

5094
03:28:59,700 --> 03:29:03,680
Sort of one of which is sort of the Apple marketplace

5095
03:29:05,640 --> 03:29:08,463
that charges 30% from developers.

5096
03:29:09,720 --> 03:29:14,720
Can you speak about this idea

5097
03:29:15,330 --> 03:29:17,727
that you believe that Apple

5098
03:29:17,727 --> 03:29:20,880
and other companies valves should not be charging

5099
03:29:20,880 --> 03:29:23,520
that kind of revenue cut?

5100
03:29:23,520 --> 03:29:24,780
- Sure, well let's start

5101
03:29:24,780 --> 03:29:28,110
from a very basic principle of computing.

5102
03:29:28,110 --> 03:29:30,840
The first computer I owned was an Apple II +, you know,

5103
03:29:30,840 --> 03:29:33,690
designed by Steve Wozniak and marketed by Apple

5104
03:29:33,690 --> 03:29:35,340
and then an IBM PC.

5105
03:29:35,340 --> 03:29:38,670
And in those days anybody could write code.

5106
03:29:38,670 --> 03:29:40,920
Your computer literally turned on

5107
03:29:40,920 --> 03:29:42,203
with a programming language prompt in front of you.

5108
03:29:42,203 --> 03:29:45,270
You had to actually do work to not write a program

5109
03:29:45,270 --> 03:29:47,940
and to instead run somebody else's program.

5110
03:29:47,940 --> 03:29:49,140
That was incredibly empowering.

5111
03:29:49,140 --> 03:29:50,310
And anybody could write a program,

5112
03:29:50,310 --> 03:29:51,840
anybody could put it on a floppy desk,

5113
03:29:51,840 --> 03:29:54,000
anybody could share it with their friends.

5114
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:56,670
Anybody could make copies of that, put it in a store,

5115
03:29:56,670 --> 03:29:58,590
they could sell it, they could build a business around it.

5116
03:29:58,590 --> 03:30:01,740
And they were completely able to,

5117
03:30:01,740 --> 03:30:05,940
without seeking any big tech corporation's permission,

5118
03:30:05,940 --> 03:30:06,773
do whoever they want.

5119
03:30:06,773 --> 03:30:08,220
Even from IBM, remember IBM

5120
03:30:08,220 --> 03:30:11,370
was the dominant computer company on Earth at the time

5121
03:30:11,370 --> 03:30:13,953
that they released IBM PC as an open platform.

5122
03:30:14,790 --> 03:30:16,710
And you know, so it's really been firmly implanted

5123
03:30:16,710 --> 03:30:19,470
in my mind that this was a magical

5124
03:30:19,470 --> 03:30:24,470
and wonderful time of unmatched economic progress

5125
03:30:24,750 --> 03:30:28,203
for technology in the entire world.

5126
03:30:29,340 --> 03:30:32,550
And you know, over time the big companies have realized

5127
03:30:32,550 --> 03:30:33,477
that they could shut down

5128
03:30:33,477 --> 03:30:38,070
and just block software makers from releasing software

5129
03:30:38,070 --> 03:30:41,580
on their own and block software makers from doing business

5130
03:30:41,580 --> 03:30:42,843
with customers directly.

5131
03:30:43,800 --> 03:30:46,470
And yeah, I've always viewed this practice

5132
03:30:46,470 --> 03:30:48,330
as terribly abusive

5133
03:30:48,330 --> 03:30:52,080
because when you buy a computer or a phone,

5134
03:30:52,080 --> 03:30:53,130
you spend good money on it,

5135
03:30:53,130 --> 03:30:55,200
it's your money you spend on that phone

5136
03:30:55,200 --> 03:30:56,970
and now you own that phone.

5137
03:30:56,970 --> 03:31:00,750
And there's absolutely no reason that Apple should block you

5138
03:31:00,750 --> 03:31:02,440
from installing apps

5139
03:31:03,750 --> 03:31:05,640
from other developers directly if you want,

5140
03:31:05,640 --> 03:31:08,610
going to their webpage or writing your own apps

5141
03:31:08,610 --> 03:31:11,670
without their permission and running them yourself

5142
03:31:11,670 --> 03:31:13,380
without having to get a developer account,

5143
03:31:13,380 --> 03:31:15,730
without having to go through their bureaucracy.

5144
03:31:16,770 --> 03:31:18,240
And there's no reason that any consumer

5145
03:31:18,240 --> 03:31:20,313
who gets an app shouldn't be able to do business directly

5146
03:31:20,313 --> 03:31:22,830
with the developer of the consumer.

5147
03:31:22,830 --> 03:31:24,450
You already bought that phone.

5148
03:31:24,450 --> 03:31:27,720
Why should Apple be adding a 30% junk fee

5149
03:31:27,720 --> 03:31:29,940
to all commerce you do.

5150
03:31:29,940 --> 03:31:31,350
And why do they selectively apply it

5151
03:31:31,350 --> 03:31:32,850
to some things and not others?

5152
03:31:33,870 --> 03:31:35,920
I've always viewed this as deeply abusive

5153
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:39,390
and that it shuts down the competitive engine

5154
03:31:39,390 --> 03:31:42,120
that once fueled the app and software economy.

5155
03:31:42,120 --> 03:31:44,430
It's still a vibrant competitive engine on Windows

5156
03:31:44,430 --> 03:31:48,060
and on the internet, but it's no longer with mobile apps

5157
03:31:48,060 --> 03:31:50,500
because these stores have popped up

5158
03:31:51,360 --> 03:31:55,380
and they don't provide any useful value to the user.

5159
03:31:55,380 --> 03:31:57,360
Yes, they're a search function to find software,

5160
03:31:57,360 --> 03:31:58,650
but there's no reason other companies

5161
03:31:58,650 --> 03:31:59,730
couldn't build a better one.

5162
03:31:59,730 --> 03:32:01,290
And I bet if you had Steam

5163
03:32:01,290 --> 03:32:03,510
or if you had Valve build Steam for iPhone,

5164
03:32:03,510 --> 03:32:06,030
I bet Steam for iPhone would be a much better app store

5165
03:32:06,030 --> 03:32:07,170
than the iOS App Store.

5166
03:32:07,170 --> 03:32:09,210
And a lot of people would use it.

5167
03:32:09,210 --> 03:32:10,560
And that Apple would be forced

5168
03:32:10,560 --> 03:32:12,870
to build a better app store in competition

5169
03:32:12,870 --> 03:32:16,320
and everybody would improve their products as a result.

5170
03:32:16,320 --> 03:32:18,030
But you know, Apple and Google shutting down

5171
03:32:18,030 --> 03:32:21,870
the competitive engine that drives the software economy

5172
03:32:21,870 --> 03:32:24,153
has massive implications for everything.

5173
03:32:25,200 --> 03:32:27,930
And you know, one of them is reshaping

5174
03:32:27,930 --> 03:32:31,020
the nature of mobile apps to be really offensive

5175
03:32:31,020 --> 03:32:32,850
to gamer sensibilities.

5176
03:32:32,850 --> 03:32:34,140
You know, if you go on console,

5177
03:32:34,140 --> 03:32:36,900
the best console games you see listed in the store,

5178
03:32:36,900 --> 03:32:39,363
on the storefronts, the best console games

5179
03:32:39,363 --> 03:32:42,480
that you see reviewed are awesome games

5180
03:32:42,480 --> 03:32:44,130
that really have a lot of creative merit.

5181
03:32:44,130 --> 03:32:48,180
The ones that sell the best are really enormous values

5182
03:32:48,180 --> 03:32:49,013
for their money

5183
03:32:50,066 --> 03:32:52,830
or their product of an immense amount of work.

5184
03:32:52,830 --> 03:32:54,540
You don't see that on iPhone.

5185
03:32:54,540 --> 03:32:57,420
The top apps on iPhone or the top games on iPhone

5186
03:32:57,420 --> 03:33:00,780
at almost all times are these ridiculously greedy,

5187
03:33:00,780 --> 03:33:03,360
high monetizing, you know, whale games,

5188
03:33:03,360 --> 03:33:06,750
which are pervaded with pay to win and loot box practices,

5189
03:33:06,750 --> 03:33:10,110
you know, they have a sort of a legalized a form of gambling

5190
03:33:10,110 --> 03:33:12,750
and you know, these games are not driven by fun,

5191
03:33:12,750 --> 03:33:14,970
they're driven by manipulation

5192
03:33:14,970 --> 03:33:17,163
of the players to greedy ends.

5193
03:33:18,480 --> 03:33:21,360
And you know, it's very hard for the fun-based games

5194
03:33:21,360 --> 03:33:23,340
to actually succeed there.

5195
03:33:23,340 --> 03:33:26,100
And you know, the cost of operating these online games

5196
03:33:26,100 --> 03:33:27,180
now are enormously high.

5197
03:33:27,180 --> 03:33:28,620
So you have a game that's based on fun,

5198
03:33:28,620 --> 03:33:32,390
it's not loot box heavy, you know, you have to pay 30%

5199
03:33:32,390 --> 03:33:33,810
of your revenue to Apple

5200
03:33:33,810 --> 03:33:36,780
in order to just get access to the platform.

5201
03:33:36,780 --> 03:33:40,020
And 30% is way, way, way more than most gaming companies

5202
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:41,730
make in profits right now.

5203
03:33:41,730 --> 03:33:44,850
And so if the that fee is more than the profit

5204
03:33:44,850 --> 03:33:45,720
from a natural company,

5205
03:33:45,720 --> 03:33:48,330
then they can only stay in business by raising prices.

5206
03:33:48,330 --> 03:33:51,300
So these 30% fees are raising prices of all digital goods.

5207
03:33:51,300 --> 03:33:54,123
It's just inflationary as a force in the economy.

5208
03:33:55,500 --> 03:33:57,330
That's just the first drag text.

5209
03:33:57,330 --> 03:34:01,710
But then to reach users, when a user searches for like,

5210
03:34:01,710 --> 03:34:03,480
before Apple blocked "Fortnite" on iOS,

5211
03:34:03,480 --> 03:34:05,220
when a user searched for "Fortnite,"

5212
03:34:05,220 --> 03:34:07,650
the first result was always some competing game.

5213
03:34:07,650 --> 03:34:09,723
Like it's utterly anti-user.

5214
03:34:09,723 --> 03:34:11,337
Like you search for Steam for a game

5215
03:34:11,337 --> 03:34:15,091
and if that game's on Steam, it's the first result always.

5216
03:34:15,091 --> 03:34:17,130
'Cause Steam's not getting in inshitified

5217
03:34:17,130 --> 03:34:19,620
with advertising, Apple is.

5218
03:34:19,620 --> 03:34:20,640
And you know, they do that

5219
03:34:20,640 --> 03:34:22,380
so they can make even more than 30%.

5220
03:34:22,380 --> 03:34:24,720
So if you wanna be the first search result

5221
03:34:24,720 --> 03:34:27,480
for your game, you're probably paying more like 45%.

5222
03:34:27,480 --> 03:34:29,070
If you wanna reach users on social media,

5223
03:34:29,070 --> 03:34:30,630
you're paying another 20%.

5224
03:34:30,630 --> 03:34:33,240
So literally something like 70% of the revenue

5225
03:34:33,240 --> 03:34:36,480
for your game is just going into junk fees

5226
03:34:36,480 --> 03:34:38,577
to acquire users and get them in your game.

5227
03:34:38,577 --> 03:34:41,520
And the money that's left over is only enough to fund these,

5228
03:34:41,520 --> 03:34:44,850
you know, games with rather abusive practices

5229
03:34:44,850 --> 03:34:46,770
that do not look to normal gamers like games

5230
03:34:46,770 --> 03:34:47,603
for the most part.

5231
03:34:47,603 --> 03:34:48,540
Now there are some exceptions.

5232
03:34:48,540 --> 03:34:49,890
There are some great games on iOS

5233
03:34:49,890 --> 03:34:51,480
and there's some games with good practices,

5234
03:34:51,480 --> 03:34:54,810
but you know, the engine has been really corrupted in a way

5235
03:34:54,810 --> 03:34:56,340
that competition would fix.

5236
03:34:56,340 --> 03:34:59,310
If you unleashed lots of competing stores on iOS,

5237
03:34:59,310 --> 03:35:01,290
then you'd have lots of awesome options

5238
03:35:01,290 --> 03:35:04,230
and you'd have much better deals and much better prices.

5239
03:35:04,230 --> 03:35:06,000
- I had a quick chat with Matthew.

5240
03:35:06,000 --> 03:35:08,160
He asked me to ask you this question of

5241
03:35:08,160 --> 03:35:12,000
why don't more companies fight Apple in the way openly

5242
03:35:12,000 --> 03:35:14,880
and totally as Epic has been.

5243
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:16,920
What makes you, what makes Epic

5244
03:35:16,920 --> 03:35:18,537
so unique in this regard?

5245
03:35:18,537 --> 03:35:21,510
And I should say, I think everything you said

5246
03:35:21,510 --> 03:35:22,830
I agree with fully.

5247
03:35:22,830 --> 03:35:26,640
I think what Apple is doing is just wrong.

5248
03:35:26,640 --> 03:35:30,240
I think Apple in many dimensions is an incredible company.

5249
03:35:30,240 --> 03:35:33,630
They have brought so much good for the world.

5250
03:35:33,630 --> 03:35:36,120
In this regard,

5251
03:35:36,120 --> 03:35:39,630
I just think it's straight up wrong what they're doing.

5252
03:35:39,630 --> 03:35:42,113
That they're not providing the value of 30%.

5253
03:35:43,170 --> 03:35:47,280
And even if they were the monopolization,

5254
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:50,610
the centralized control without competition is wrong.

5255
03:35:50,610 --> 03:35:54,900
Anyway, why are you fearlessly fighting Apple on this?

5256
03:35:54,900 --> 03:35:58,410
And other companies don't seem to wanna step up?

5257
03:35:58,410 --> 03:36:01,030
- All companies are terrified of Apple

5258
03:36:02,010 --> 03:36:04,083
because Apple can destroy their business.

5259
03:36:06,660 --> 03:36:08,550
Epic was in a unique position with "Fortnite,"

5260
03:36:08,550 --> 03:36:10,250
first of all having the, you know,

5261
03:36:11,154 --> 03:36:12,360
the biggest game in the world at the time

5262
03:36:12,360 --> 03:36:13,960
we started the fight with Apple.

5263
03:36:14,850 --> 03:36:17,220
And second of all, having a majority of our users

5264
03:36:17,220 --> 03:36:19,650
playing on PC and console

5265
03:36:19,650 --> 03:36:22,740
meant that if we lost access to iOS during a fight,

5266
03:36:22,740 --> 03:36:24,960
then we would still be able to survive.

5267
03:36:24,960 --> 03:36:26,133
That a bigger part,

5268
03:36:28,080 --> 03:36:32,670
Spotify, Facebook, you name the top 10 mobile apps,

5269
03:36:32,670 --> 03:36:35,640
I think none of them would be able to survive without Apple.

5270
03:36:35,640 --> 03:36:37,710
Like literally their business would be destroyed

5271
03:36:37,710 --> 03:36:40,380
if Apple blocked access to them.

5272
03:36:40,380 --> 03:36:45,180
And Apple is incredibly clear with developers

5273
03:36:45,180 --> 03:36:48,660
that they're willing to deprive all users of access

5274
03:36:48,660 --> 03:36:50,733
to any app if they get in a fight.

5275
03:36:51,690 --> 03:36:53,280
And they've, you know, if you look at how they dealt

5276
03:36:53,280 --> 03:36:57,420
with Epic, they were not just legally maneuvering

5277
03:36:57,420 --> 03:36:59,640
with the intent of winning the court case against us,

5278
03:36:59,640 --> 03:37:00,870
they were also sending a message

5279
03:37:00,870 --> 03:37:02,100
to all developers in the world.

5280
03:37:02,100 --> 03:37:03,510
We will destroy your business

5281
03:37:03,510 --> 03:37:06,900
or we will try our best if you fight us.

5282
03:37:06,900 --> 03:37:08,820
And a very small number of vocal developers

5283
03:37:08,820 --> 03:37:10,080
have been willing to speak up

5284
03:37:10,080 --> 03:37:13,080
and Apple was actually refrained from crushing

5285
03:37:13,080 --> 03:37:16,230
their businesses when they weren't violating

5286
03:37:16,230 --> 03:37:17,613
any Apple policies.

5287
03:37:18,570 --> 03:37:20,370
And that took a bit of discipline,

5288
03:37:20,370 --> 03:37:23,343
which I think is also amount of calculation by Apple

5289
03:37:23,343 --> 03:37:26,880
that they couldn't survive being seen as the company killer,

5290
03:37:26,880 --> 03:37:30,060
that if you criticize us will crush your company.

5291
03:37:30,060 --> 03:37:32,340
But you know, the other thing that Apple has,

5292
03:37:32,340 --> 03:37:34,620
that they can and will readily deploy

5293
03:37:34,620 --> 03:37:36,960
against every developer is soft power.

5294
03:37:36,960 --> 03:37:40,920
When they take 30% and advertising is so expensive,

5295
03:37:40,920 --> 03:37:44,520
soft power by Apple, like approving your updates faster

5296
03:37:44,520 --> 03:37:45,870
or slowing down all of your updates

5297
03:37:45,870 --> 03:37:48,810
by a couple weeks can also have a dramatic effect

5298
03:37:48,810 --> 03:37:51,570
on your ability to compete successfully.

5299
03:37:51,570 --> 03:37:53,730
And Apple, it's a very long history of playing

5300
03:37:53,730 --> 03:37:55,380
cat and mouse games with developers.

5301
03:37:55,380 --> 03:37:59,550
It's like a developer isn't in Apple's good graces,

5302
03:37:59,550 --> 03:38:00,930
so just slow down the updates.

5303
03:38:00,930 --> 03:38:03,060
So they've been slowing down updates

5304
03:38:03,060 --> 03:38:05,940
for several major tech companies, sometimes for weeks,

5305
03:38:05,940 --> 03:38:08,520
sometimes for months without all going under the radar

5306
03:38:08,520 --> 03:38:11,220
because everybody's afraid to challenge them publicly.

5307
03:38:12,210 --> 03:38:14,670
And so Apple's wielding a soft power can change

5308
03:38:14,670 --> 03:38:16,560
a company's economics for the worse,

5309
03:38:16,560 --> 03:38:19,560
enough to deter almost any public company.

5310
03:38:19,560 --> 03:38:20,820
And you know, Epic is in the fight

5311
03:38:20,820 --> 03:38:22,650
because I firmly believe

5312
03:38:22,650 --> 03:38:24,600
that something like the metaverse will only arise,

5313
03:38:24,600 --> 03:38:28,440
it's something like a billion plus user, you know,

5314
03:38:28,440 --> 03:38:33,420
real-time 3D social ecosystem that grows to encompass

5315
03:38:33,420 --> 03:38:35,700
potentially all or most major games

5316
03:38:35,700 --> 03:38:39,120
by all major developers tied together into an open economy

5317
03:38:39,120 --> 03:38:40,860
where they all participate as peers

5318
03:38:40,860 --> 03:38:43,480
and they all compete to give users the best deals

5319
03:38:44,490 --> 03:38:46,590
and they grow and, you know, do business

5320
03:38:46,590 --> 03:38:48,060
with their customers directly.

5321
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:51,240
That thing can only exist if the Apple

5322
03:38:51,240 --> 03:38:55,230
and Google gatekeeping monopolies are lifted.

5323
03:38:55,230 --> 03:38:57,150
And it's not just the 30% fees.

5324
03:38:57,150 --> 03:38:59,310
30% fees are economically ruin us,

5325
03:38:59,310 --> 03:39:01,710
but they impose other levels of control.

5326
03:39:01,710 --> 03:39:04,710
Apple prevents all web browsers on iOS from implementing

5327
03:39:04,710 --> 03:39:06,870
web standards better than Apple does.

5328
03:39:06,870 --> 03:39:10,900
So Apple has really limited data storage capabilities

5329
03:39:12,355 --> 03:39:16,891
and 3D graphics capabilities on, you know, the iOS web APIs.

5330
03:39:16,891 --> 03:39:18,690
So APIs you can access from web apps

5331
03:39:18,690 --> 03:39:20,490
running within a web browser.

5332
03:39:20,490 --> 03:39:22,920
And you know, that's to eventually cripple those apps

5333
03:39:22,920 --> 03:39:27,180
to ensure that they can't possibly compete with native apps.

5334
03:39:27,180 --> 03:39:29,280
And by depriving web apps of those features,

5335
03:39:29,280 --> 03:39:32,250
they prevent web apps from competing with native apps.

5336
03:39:32,250 --> 03:39:34,050
Well, you know, Apple,

5337
03:39:34,050 --> 03:39:36,510
if they treat the Metaverse the way they treat the web,

5338
03:39:36,510 --> 03:39:39,480
they'll say you can only use Apple's metaverse engine.

5339
03:39:39,480 --> 03:39:41,700
Unreal Engine is disallowed.

5340
03:39:41,700 --> 03:39:43,680
And then they can impose all of their own limitations

5341
03:39:43,680 --> 03:39:46,230
on the metaverse to force all commerce through Apple

5342
03:39:46,230 --> 03:39:48,780
or force it to be so uncompetitive

5343
03:39:48,780 --> 03:39:51,300
and lousy that it can't compete.

5344
03:39:51,300 --> 03:39:52,770
And you know, they have this giant array

5345
03:39:52,770 --> 03:39:54,780
of these anti-competitive techniques that they use

5346
03:39:54,780 --> 03:39:58,200
to disadvantage other app developers, you know,

5347
03:39:58,200 --> 03:40:00,270
saying only Apple can build certain kinds of apps

5348
03:40:00,270 --> 03:40:03,180
or only Apple can integrate certain features.

5349
03:40:03,180 --> 03:40:06,120
In Europe, even where the DMA law requires Apple

5350
03:40:06,120 --> 03:40:07,230
to allow competing stores,

5351
03:40:07,230 --> 03:40:09,240
they say a store can only be a store.

5352
03:40:09,240 --> 03:40:11,490
You can't build a store into Facebook,

5353
03:40:11,490 --> 03:40:13,243
you can't build a social network into a store.

5354
03:40:13,243 --> 03:40:14,790
A store must only be a store

5355
03:40:14,790 --> 03:40:16,710
because a store that's more than a store might be able

5356
03:40:16,710 --> 03:40:19,200
to compete with us more effectively.

5357
03:40:19,200 --> 03:40:22,800
It's just a giant, you know, to use the Soviet term,

5358
03:40:22,800 --> 03:40:24,270
it's a defense in depth strategy

5359
03:40:24,270 --> 03:40:27,480
where they've constructed a massive series of barriers,

5360
03:40:27,480 --> 03:40:30,000
each are fatal to any attempt to compete

5361
03:40:30,000 --> 03:40:32,100
so that even if one barrier is overcome,

5362
03:40:32,100 --> 03:40:34,770
the others remain in place and shut down the whole scheme.

5363
03:40:34,770 --> 03:40:37,560
And that's playing out in Europe where Apple has enabled us

5364
03:40:37,560 --> 03:40:40,980
to launch the Epic Game Store, but has made it so difficult

5365
03:40:40,980 --> 03:40:43,620
and uncompetitive both for Epic

5366
03:40:43,620 --> 03:40:47,387
and for clients who we want to do business with that,

5367
03:40:47,387 --> 03:40:48,450
you know, it has no chance of success

5368
03:40:48,450 --> 03:40:50,160
until the European Union

5369
03:40:50,160 --> 03:40:53,880
and starts to really enforce the DMA law and impose harsh

5370
03:40:53,880 --> 03:40:56,640
and serious penalties on Apple to force compliance.

5371
03:40:56,640 --> 03:41:00,180
- I think it should be said, once again, I think it's wrong

5372
03:41:00,180 --> 03:41:03,030
what they're doing there and I hope there's public pressure

5373
03:41:03,030 --> 03:41:07,083
and government pressure for them to open up the platform.

5374
03:41:08,580 --> 03:41:11,260
And I believe as a person

5375
03:41:12,210 --> 03:41:17,043
who loves Apple, I believe this is also good for Apple.

5376
03:41:18,420 --> 03:41:21,690
There's the natural thing in companies to want to close

5377
03:41:21,690 --> 03:41:25,050
and control and crush competition.

5378
03:41:25,050 --> 03:41:28,170
But like Apple is full of brilliant engineers,

5379
03:41:28,170 --> 03:41:32,400
open it up and win, it's going to create the right

5380
03:41:32,400 --> 03:41:36,450
kind of competitive incentive to make the Apple Store better

5381
03:41:36,450 --> 03:41:37,980
to make, you know,

5382
03:41:37,980 --> 03:41:40,650
'cause they're great at creating great interfaces,

5383
03:41:40,650 --> 03:41:42,870
but competition will sharpen the sword.

5384
03:41:42,870 --> 03:41:46,320
I mean, it's just gonna make everything much better.

5385
03:41:46,320 --> 03:41:48,630
So I do hope there's a lot of public pressure

5386
03:41:48,630 --> 03:41:49,890
and I deeply appreciate

5387
03:41:49,890 --> 03:41:52,320
that you're speaking out in this way, sort of putting

5388
03:41:52,320 --> 03:41:56,280
that pressure and letting people know

5389
03:41:56,280 --> 03:41:58,410
like it's okay to say that this is wrong.

5390
03:41:58,410 --> 03:42:01,320
- Thanks, competition makes everybody better.

5391
03:42:01,320 --> 03:42:02,940
You have a monopoly that's forced to compete,

5392
03:42:02,940 --> 03:42:04,890
suddenly the monopolies products get much better,

5393
03:42:04,890 --> 03:42:07,260
the offerings to consumers get much better.

5394
03:42:07,260 --> 03:42:11,130
You see so many areas where Apple could be the best,

5395
03:42:11,130 --> 03:42:13,260
but what they have is just really, really lousy.

5396
03:42:13,260 --> 03:42:16,080
And it's this old guard of leadership who is clinging

5397
03:42:16,080 --> 03:42:19,065
to these old policies, turning themselves into the enemy

5398
03:42:19,065 --> 03:42:22,080
of every developer, every regulator.

5399
03:42:22,080 --> 03:42:24,210
And I think it's ultimately massively to their detriment.

5400
03:42:24,210 --> 03:42:26,220
And I can't wait for a new generation to come in

5401
03:42:26,220 --> 03:42:29,580
and, you know, paint a bright path to the future.

5402
03:42:29,580 --> 03:42:31,480
Epic was an awesome partner to Apple

5403
03:42:32,430 --> 03:42:35,790
for more than a decade of demos and partnership

5404
03:42:35,790 --> 03:42:37,470
and technology usage together.

5405
03:42:37,470 --> 03:42:39,210
And we did amazing things together.

5406
03:42:39,210 --> 03:42:44,130
Love nothing more than to have that Apple, you know,

5407
03:42:44,130 --> 03:42:48,270
bringing back Steve Wozniak's original views.

5408
03:42:48,270 --> 03:42:50,488
Just the Apple II was such an amazing thing.

5409
03:42:50,488 --> 03:42:52,470
It's a completely open platform.

5410
03:42:52,470 --> 03:42:55,200
The manual to the Apple II included a listing

5411
03:42:55,200 --> 03:42:56,930
for all the ROMs, the source code to the ROMs,

5412
03:42:56,930 --> 03:42:59,220
so you could understand exactly what was happening there

5413
03:42:59,220 --> 03:43:00,500
and you could learn from it.

5414
03:43:00,500 --> 03:43:03,810
It included a hardware schematic of the entire computer

5415
03:43:03,810 --> 03:43:06,237
so you could learn how to make a peripheral and plug it in

5416
03:43:06,237 --> 03:43:07,797
and an open ecosystem.

5417
03:43:07,797 --> 03:43:09,510
And that's the awesome Apple,

5418
03:43:09,510 --> 03:43:11,490
that company would be the best company in the world.

5419
03:43:11,490 --> 03:43:15,030
Again, I think the current one is just

5420
03:43:15,030 --> 03:43:17,670
on the wrong side of history and needs to change.

5421
03:43:17,670 --> 03:43:21,600
- Well I hope Epic and Apple find a path forward together

5422
03:43:21,600 --> 03:43:22,680
and flourishing together

5423
03:43:22,680 --> 03:43:24,753
and Apple embraces competition better.

5424
03:43:26,070 --> 03:43:28,230
One of the things I admire about this conversation

5425
03:43:28,230 --> 03:43:32,460
that you mentioned Steam a bunch, with kind words,

5426
03:43:32,460 --> 03:43:36,870
supportive and basically never mentioned Epic Game Store.

5427
03:43:36,870 --> 03:43:37,703
I love that.

5428
03:43:37,703 --> 03:43:39,090
So I really love that.

5429
03:43:39,090 --> 03:43:43,110
It really embodies the fact that you want variety,

5430
03:43:43,110 --> 03:43:47,560
you want freedom for people to choose the best thing

5431
03:43:48,682 --> 03:43:51,900
and in so doing, create this large network

5432
03:43:51,900 --> 03:43:54,780
of humans interacting freely with each other.

5433
03:43:54,780 --> 03:43:59,070
Okay, that said, one of the competitive pressures

5434
03:43:59,070 --> 03:44:01,920
that Epic has created a few years ago

5435
03:44:01,920 --> 03:44:04,470
was by launching the Epic Game Store.

5436
03:44:04,470 --> 03:44:08,520
And instead of Steam's 30% revenue cut,

5437
03:44:08,520 --> 03:44:11,580
you went with 12% revenue cut

5438
03:44:11,580 --> 03:44:14,197
creating the competitive pressure saying, you know,

5439
03:44:14,197 --> 03:44:18,717
"Listen, this shouldn't be that high of a cut."

5440
03:44:20,490 --> 03:44:22,830
Which I thought was like amazing.

5441
03:44:22,830 --> 03:44:24,210
This is a brilliant idea

5442
03:44:24,210 --> 03:44:26,520
and I think it still is a brilliant idea, it's wonderful.

5443
03:44:26,520 --> 03:44:28,440
Now in preparing for this conversation,

5444
03:44:28,440 --> 03:44:29,940
I looked on the internet and I saw

5445
03:44:29,940 --> 03:44:34,940
there's a lot of criticism of EGS at Big Game Store.

5446
03:44:35,880 --> 03:44:39,673
First of all, I should say the internet, (laughs)

5447
03:44:41,310 --> 03:44:43,440
it's full of drama and criticism.

5448
03:44:43,440 --> 03:44:46,500
Like there's not enough celebrating of awesome shit,

5449
03:44:46,500 --> 03:44:47,580
that let's get...

5450
03:44:47,580 --> 03:44:50,760
If I can ask the internet as a blob one request,

5451
03:44:50,760 --> 03:44:54,450
can we just celebrate awesome and also criticize.

5452
03:44:54,450 --> 03:44:56,340
But just like there's not enough celebration.

5453
03:44:56,340 --> 03:45:01,340
Anyway, the two directions of criticism

5454
03:45:01,440 --> 03:45:04,950
is just straight up the Launcher interface is clunky

5455
03:45:04,950 --> 03:45:07,680
and lacks a lot of the features of Steam.

5456
03:45:07,680 --> 03:45:10,650
And then the second set of criticism

5457
03:45:10,650 --> 03:45:15,330
is the exclusive contracts

5458
03:45:15,330 --> 03:45:18,720
which were made with some of the games

5459
03:45:18,720 --> 03:45:22,350
that are on Epic Game Store.

5460
03:45:22,350 --> 03:45:25,320
So first huge props on the 12%.

5461
03:45:25,320 --> 03:45:26,907
Maybe you could speak to the vision of that.

5462
03:45:26,907 --> 03:45:31,530
And second, can you comment on those two criticisms?

5463
03:45:31,530 --> 03:45:36,300
- Sure, yeah, I think, one of the reasons that people

5464
03:45:36,300 --> 03:45:38,850
characterize the Epic Games launcher is clunky

5465
03:45:38,850 --> 03:45:41,300
is because like the Epic Games launcher is clunky

5466
03:45:42,270 --> 03:45:45,060
and we need to improve this. (laughs)

5467
03:45:45,060 --> 03:45:47,340
You know, there's a lot of work going on there

5468
03:45:47,340 --> 03:45:51,030
and you know, I wish we'd gotten better

5469
03:45:51,030 --> 03:45:53,220
at addressing quality of life features

5470
03:45:53,220 --> 03:45:57,049
and prioritize them above all of the other features.

5471
03:45:57,049 --> 03:46:00,120
You know, because Steam has 15 years of built up work

5472
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:02,400
by many of the best programmers in the whole industry

5473
03:46:02,400 --> 03:46:03,313
working on that.

5474
03:46:03,313 --> 03:46:06,030
A much larger team working on Steam

5475
03:46:06,030 --> 03:46:08,817
and a lot more time working on it.

5476
03:46:08,817 --> 03:46:11,610
And so we've had to make a lot of prioritization decisions

5477
03:46:11,610 --> 03:46:15,260
about what do we support with the Epic Game Store and when.

5478
03:46:15,260 --> 03:46:17,670
A lot of the time it's been supporting commercial features

5479
03:46:17,670 --> 03:46:20,280
like merchandising, offering multiple versions of a game

5480
03:46:20,280 --> 03:46:22,980
for sale and offering upgrades from the regular edition

5481
03:46:22,980 --> 03:46:25,680
to the deluxe edition and other things that partners work.

5482
03:46:25,680 --> 03:46:28,440
And you know, other priorities have been quality of life

5483
03:46:28,440 --> 03:46:30,300
and launcher load times and other things.

5484
03:46:30,300 --> 03:46:32,340
And we've not put enough emphasis

5485
03:46:32,340 --> 03:46:34,410
on the quality of life features.

5486
03:46:34,410 --> 03:46:37,230
We've recognized this very clearly multiple times

5487
03:46:37,230 --> 03:46:38,940
and we've gone through multiple refactorings.

5488
03:46:38,940 --> 03:46:41,850
But you know, that's definitely been a disappointment to us

5489
03:46:41,850 --> 03:46:43,383
and to a lot of users.

5490
03:46:44,340 --> 03:46:47,160
And I think one thing it took us a while to realize

5491
03:46:47,160 --> 03:46:49,890
was it's not in uniform.

5492
03:46:49,890 --> 03:46:52,530
Depending on your proximity to a CDN

5493
03:46:52,530 --> 03:46:54,780
and the size of your game collection,

5494
03:46:54,780 --> 03:46:57,153
it can be either awesome or really clunky.

5495
03:46:58,080 --> 03:47:01,110
And the users for whom it's really clunky

5496
03:47:01,110 --> 03:47:04,112
are the people like I think

5497
03:47:04,112 --> 03:47:05,280
are a large part of the complaints.

5498
03:47:05,280 --> 03:47:06,360
- They're gonna speak up.

5499
03:47:06,360 --> 03:47:09,330
And I should also say that the Steam launcher

5500
03:47:09,330 --> 03:47:11,460
for a long time, from my memory,

5501
03:47:11,460 --> 03:47:14,130
but also just looking online was also very clunky

5502
03:47:14,130 --> 03:47:15,120
in the beginning.

5503
03:47:15,120 --> 03:47:18,960
- Yeah and you know, one of the criticisms of Epic Game

5504
03:47:18,960 --> 03:47:20,460
Store from the beginning was you don't have

5505
03:47:20,460 --> 03:47:21,570
all of the features of Steam,

5506
03:47:21,570 --> 03:47:22,460
but we very much don't want

5507
03:47:22,460 --> 03:47:24,150
to have all of the features of Steam.

5508
03:47:24,150 --> 03:47:26,457
Like Steam has forums to get to your game

5509
03:47:26,457 --> 03:47:28,740
and like we decide we don't wanna create forums

5510
03:47:28,740 --> 03:47:30,180
and our partners when we talk to them,

5511
03:47:30,180 --> 03:47:32,580
generally didn't want us to create Epic Game Store forums

5512
03:47:32,580 --> 03:47:33,413
for their games

5513
03:47:33,413 --> 03:47:34,830
because there's already, you know,

5514
03:47:34,830 --> 03:47:36,660
channels that they prefer to them.

5515
03:47:36,660 --> 03:47:38,910
There's social media and a number of platforms

5516
03:47:38,910 --> 03:47:41,370
and there's Reddit and there's lots of places for gamers

5517
03:47:41,370 --> 03:47:42,807
to discuss their game

5518
03:47:42,807 --> 03:47:45,477
and they preferred those discussions to be there.

5519
03:47:45,477 --> 03:47:48,090
And so it's very much not our goal to mimic everything

5520
03:47:48,090 --> 03:47:50,490
of Steam, but we do wanna have

5521
03:47:50,490 --> 03:47:53,280
all of the convenience features that makes it as easy

5522
03:47:53,280 --> 03:47:55,020
and fun to use as Steam.

5523
03:47:55,020 --> 03:47:57,030
So there's a long journey ahead,

5524
03:47:57,030 --> 03:47:58,530
but you know, we continue to reinvest in

5525
03:47:58,530 --> 03:48:00,030
and you know, we're working

5526
03:48:00,030 --> 03:48:01,860
to build a multi-billion dollar business there

5527
03:48:01,860 --> 03:48:03,483
and think we'll succeed.

5528
03:48:04,650 --> 03:48:06,303
Already at the Epic Game Store,

5529
03:48:07,620 --> 03:48:10,530
yeah, supports an immense amount of Epic games commerce

5530
03:48:10,530 --> 03:48:13,770
in "Fortnite," on PC, now on Android and iOS

5531
03:48:13,770 --> 03:48:15,840
and the European Union too.

5532
03:48:15,840 --> 03:48:17,640
So it's a forever facet of the industry

5533
03:48:17,640 --> 03:48:19,623
and we are never losing heart in it.

5534
03:48:20,670 --> 03:48:22,110
And we think at some point, you know,

5535
03:48:22,110 --> 03:48:25,560
I really feel that the benefits of the Epic Games approach

5536
03:48:25,560 --> 03:48:28,050
are gonna outweigh the benefits of this Steam approach,

5537
03:48:28,050 --> 03:48:30,810
especially as gaming becomes multi-platform.

5538
03:48:30,810 --> 03:48:34,530
One of the things that really sucks for all gamers is that,

5539
03:48:34,530 --> 03:48:37,830
you know, you have a lot of friends in the real world,

5540
03:48:37,830 --> 03:48:39,630
everyone has different platforms.

5541
03:48:39,630 --> 03:48:42,840
Your Steam friends aren't connected to your Xbox friends

5542
03:48:42,840 --> 03:48:44,580
and they're not connected to your PlayStation friends,

5543
03:48:44,580 --> 03:48:45,750
or your Nintendo friends.

5544
03:48:45,750 --> 03:48:48,780
And so you're very much bottling up PC gaming

5545
03:48:48,780 --> 03:48:52,050
into a kind of a hard core group of PC only folks

5546
03:48:52,050 --> 03:48:54,720
and making all of the other aspects of it difficult.

5547
03:48:54,720 --> 03:48:56,910
You know, a lot of games have flocked towards Discord,

5548
03:48:56,910 --> 03:48:58,560
which is a mess in itself.

5549
03:48:58,560 --> 03:49:00,480
Can now your Steam name is not your Discord name

5550
03:49:00,480 --> 03:49:01,770
and that's not your PlayStation name.

5551
03:49:01,770 --> 03:49:03,630
And so now you have two people in a game

5552
03:49:03,630 --> 03:49:06,603
and they have four different identities and that sucks.

5553
03:49:07,950 --> 03:49:10,140
You know, our aim for that is, you know,

5554
03:49:10,140 --> 03:49:12,360
with Epic Online Services and the social systems

5555
03:49:12,360 --> 03:49:14,430
that we built for "Fortnite" opened up

5556
03:49:14,430 --> 03:49:18,000
to all developers to have cross kept platform social

5557
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:20,370
features be super easy and free for all developers.

5558
03:49:20,370 --> 03:49:22,290
This is not something we're trying to gatekeep

5559
03:49:22,290 --> 03:49:25,710
or rent seek on or lock people into.

5560
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:28,710
It's just a way that we're making social gaming easier

5561
03:49:28,710 --> 03:49:29,880
for everybody.

5562
03:49:29,880 --> 03:49:31,820
As more and more games follow the "Fortnite" approach

5563
03:49:31,820 --> 03:49:35,160
of being multi-platform, especially multi-player games.

5564
03:49:35,160 --> 03:49:37,590
You know, Metcalfe's law is a very real phenomena

5565
03:49:37,590 --> 03:49:38,423
in the industry.

5566
03:49:38,423 --> 03:49:41,100
It's the thing that's upending some games

5567
03:49:41,100 --> 03:49:43,410
and causing growth in other games.

5568
03:49:43,410 --> 03:49:44,790
It is the number one trend

5569
03:49:44,790 --> 03:49:47,040
for pervading the world of gaming today.

5570
03:49:47,040 --> 03:49:49,920
And it says that, you know, your game is

5571
03:49:49,920 --> 03:49:52,440
quadratic more valuable the more percentage

5572
03:49:52,440 --> 03:49:55,023
of a user's real world friends they can connect to.

5573
03:49:55,860 --> 03:49:59,160
Your game vastly benefits by connecting

5574
03:49:59,160 --> 03:50:00,960
all of its players together and not, you know,

5575
03:50:00,960 --> 03:50:03,540
segregating them off into different online platform

5576
03:50:03,540 --> 03:50:05,250
populations and so on.

5577
03:50:05,250 --> 03:50:06,690
And so, you know, I think the future trend

5578
03:50:06,690 --> 03:50:08,190
is in that direction.

5579
03:50:08,190 --> 03:50:10,170
I wish Velvet opened up Steam Works

5580
03:50:10,170 --> 03:50:11,400
to just work on all platforms.

5581
03:50:11,400 --> 03:50:14,013
They could have easily done it, we did it,

5582
03:50:15,030 --> 03:50:16,920
but you know, they seem to be using it as a lever

5583
03:50:16,920 --> 03:50:19,563
to keep people locked into the Steam PC game store.

5584
03:50:20,490 --> 03:50:25,490
And you know, that's gonna be a long long running battle

5585
03:50:25,530 --> 03:50:28,170
because there's always a very toxic group of Steam users

5586
03:50:28,170 --> 03:50:30,600
who, like, they even created an entire subreddit dedicated

5587
03:50:30,600 --> 03:50:32,343
to criticizing Epic on our store.

5588
03:50:33,708 --> 03:50:35,730
And they create, you know, basically harassment campaigns

5589
03:50:35,730 --> 03:50:40,730
at times against developers who use Epic Online Services.

5590
03:50:40,890 --> 03:50:42,570
You know, developers do that

5591
03:50:42,570 --> 03:50:44,397
so they can connect their players across platforms

5592
03:50:44,397 --> 03:50:45,960
and have friends across platform

5593
03:50:45,960 --> 03:50:47,460
and voices across platforms.

5594
03:50:47,460 --> 03:50:51,060
But, you know, suddenly that's trying

5595
03:50:51,060 --> 03:50:52,740
to be turned into a negative.

5596
03:50:52,740 --> 03:50:57,270
- It's clear that Epic wants developers to win,

5597
03:50:57,270 --> 03:51:00,150
wants gamers to win

5598
03:51:00,150 --> 03:51:03,600
and wants Steam to do awesome also.

5599
03:51:03,600 --> 03:51:08,600
And in the competition between Steam and Epic Game Store,

5600
03:51:08,610 --> 03:51:11,597
like create awesome stuff together.

5601
03:51:11,597 --> 03:51:14,520
I mean there's just, it's obvious to me

5602
03:51:14,520 --> 03:51:16,170
if you don't read this stuff online,

5603
03:51:16,170 --> 03:51:21,170
but online it's like there is this just negativity

5604
03:51:21,330 --> 03:51:24,243
that I don't think is constructive in general.

5605
03:51:25,256 --> 03:51:29,610
I give a big sort of positive

5606
03:51:29,610 --> 03:51:34,350
thank you and props for the push to multi-platform

5607
03:51:34,350 --> 03:51:36,867
that was always there with for "Fortnite."

5608
03:51:38,100 --> 03:51:39,870
Perhaps before the pressure

5609
03:51:39,870 --> 03:51:43,410
that Epic created on breaking the barriers of Xbox

5610
03:51:43,410 --> 03:51:48,270
and PlayStation and PC and be being multi-platform.

5611
03:51:48,270 --> 03:51:50,520
Like I got a chance to play with "Fortnite" a little bit

5612
03:51:50,520 --> 03:51:52,740
with you and all the people in the group...

5613
03:51:52,740 --> 03:51:56,640
By the way awesome interface audio chat, really fun.

5614
03:51:56,640 --> 03:51:59,280
But you could see like a couple of PC folks,

5615
03:51:59,280 --> 03:52:02,580
a PlayStation person, Xbox person all together.

5616
03:52:02,580 --> 03:52:04,380
You can't really tell what they're using

5617
03:52:04,380 --> 03:52:05,760
except for a little icon.

5618
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:08,520
And it's nice, it's like all these barriers

5619
03:52:08,520 --> 03:52:12,070
that we've created with these platforms are gone

5620
03:52:13,110 --> 03:52:16,080
and you creating the pressure with Epic Game Store

5621
03:52:16,080 --> 03:52:19,353
and just everything you're doing with "Fortnite" platform,

5622
03:52:20,490 --> 03:52:21,510
it's really nice.

5623
03:52:21,510 --> 03:52:23,460
There's no reason to create these silos

5624
03:52:23,460 --> 03:52:25,920
'cause ultimately you should put the gamer first

5625
03:52:25,920 --> 03:52:29,020
and let everybody interact

5626
03:52:30,450 --> 03:52:32,130
with actual real life friends

5627
03:52:32,130 --> 03:52:34,980
and make new friends across the entire network of humans.

5628
03:52:34,980 --> 03:52:36,570
So anyway, thank you for that.

5629
03:52:36,570 --> 03:52:38,490
Thank you for creating that pressure.

5630
03:52:38,490 --> 03:52:41,130
- Thanks, yeah, that was an interesting time.

5631
03:52:41,130 --> 03:52:42,810
Sony had a long running policy

5632
03:52:42,810 --> 03:52:45,240
preventing cross-platform play

5633
03:52:45,240 --> 03:52:48,360
and we had a long series of conversations

5634
03:52:48,360 --> 03:52:51,303
which got pretty harsh towards the end,

5635
03:52:52,290 --> 03:52:54,270
but Sony ultimately came around

5636
03:52:54,270 --> 03:52:56,340
and they opened up PlayStation

5637
03:52:56,340 --> 03:52:58,740
and you know, through a series of private conversations

5638
03:52:58,740 --> 03:52:59,667
they did the right thing.

5639
03:52:59,667 --> 03:53:03,180
And not only that, our partnership with Sony has increased,

5640
03:53:03,180 --> 03:53:05,850
you know, since that argument back in 2018.

5641
03:53:05,850 --> 03:53:07,770
And we've gotten closer and closer

5642
03:53:07,770 --> 03:53:11,100
and done ever more things with, you know, Sony, you know,

5643
03:53:11,100 --> 03:53:13,200
brand IP like the characters from "God of War"

5644
03:53:13,200 --> 03:53:15,540
and other games coming into "Fortnite"

5645
03:53:15,540 --> 03:53:17,670
and you know, all kinds of crossovers.

5646
03:53:17,670 --> 03:53:19,290
Massive Unreal Engine adoption

5647
03:53:19,290 --> 03:53:20,700
and Sony for making games,

5648
03:53:20,700 --> 03:53:22,590
for making movies at Sony Pictures,

5649
03:53:22,590 --> 03:53:24,603
music partnerships with Sony Music.

5650
03:53:25,500 --> 03:53:27,930
That's been an absolutely wonderful relationship.

5651
03:53:27,930 --> 03:53:30,930
And I think, you know, that stands as an awesome example

5652
03:53:30,930 --> 03:53:32,910
of a company that, you know,

5653
03:53:32,910 --> 03:53:35,760
because of historic reasons got, you know,

5654
03:53:35,760 --> 03:53:38,490
stuck with a policy that no longer made sense for the future

5655
03:53:38,490 --> 03:53:41,160
and you know, following a serious discussion

5656
03:53:41,160 --> 03:53:44,400
with a close partner, righted it and did an awesome thing

5657
03:53:44,400 --> 03:53:46,680
and now Sony's much better off and Epic's better off

5658
03:53:46,680 --> 03:53:48,090
and all game developers are better off

5659
03:53:48,090 --> 03:53:49,770
and the whole console industry

5660
03:53:49,770 --> 03:53:52,470
I think it's a lot stronger now than it would've been if,

5661
03:53:52,470 --> 03:53:54,690
you know, these silos had continue to be playing out.

5662
03:53:54,690 --> 03:53:57,870
And despite the kind of potential concern

5663
03:53:57,870 --> 03:54:00,900
that like maybe blocking platform play

5664
03:54:00,900 --> 03:54:03,060
with Xbox gave Sony advantage, you know.

5665
03:54:03,060 --> 03:54:05,100
Sony's actually grown in market share

5666
03:54:05,100 --> 03:54:07,500
relative to Xbox since that time.

5667
03:54:07,500 --> 03:54:08,940
And so you can't say that anything

5668
03:54:08,940 --> 03:54:11,997
but goodness came of that time.

5669
03:54:11,997 --> 03:54:14,830
And I think a better version of Apple would've received

5670
03:54:16,290 --> 03:54:19,350
the email I sent to Senior Apple Management

5671
03:54:19,350 --> 03:54:21,480
and been like, "Huh, there's an issue here.

5672
03:54:21,480 --> 03:54:22,470
We should have a discussion,

5673
03:54:22,470 --> 03:54:24,810
we should reconsider this, we should listen."

5674
03:54:24,810 --> 03:54:28,140
And you know, they didn't and that's why we're in the midst

5675
03:54:28,140 --> 03:54:30,060
of a five-year battle with Apple

5676
03:54:30,060 --> 03:54:34,890
and in, you know, hopefully they're,

5677
03:54:34,890 --> 03:54:37,350
still the early days of a 15 plus year partnership

5678
03:54:37,350 --> 03:54:38,183
with Sony.

5679
03:54:38,183 --> 03:54:40,470
- Come on Apple, we love you Apple,

5680
03:54:40,470 --> 03:54:41,883
do a little bit better.

5681
03:54:43,020 --> 03:54:45,150
The second line of criticism that I mentioned,

5682
03:54:45,150 --> 03:54:48,180
the exclusive contracts with some of the games.

5683
03:54:48,180 --> 03:54:49,410
Can you just speak to that

5684
03:54:49,410 --> 03:54:51,750
because in so much of the journey of Epic

5685
03:54:51,750 --> 03:54:54,210
you've been sort of against exclusivity.

5686
03:54:54,210 --> 03:54:57,160
- Let's back up and talk about the principles at work here.

5687
03:54:58,470 --> 03:55:00,480
Apple forcing other companies

5688
03:55:00,480 --> 03:55:05,103
to use their payment service is a cursive decision by Apple.

5689
03:55:06,990 --> 03:55:11,990
- But if Apple convinced other developers

5690
03:55:12,170 --> 03:55:14,760
to use their payment service by offering benefits

5691
03:55:14,760 --> 03:55:17,190
or a better deal or funding

5692
03:55:17,190 --> 03:55:18,660
or any other positive incentive,

5693
03:55:18,660 --> 03:55:20,580
then that would be perfectly fine.

5694
03:55:20,580 --> 03:55:23,577
One is preventing competition

5695
03:55:23,577 --> 03:55:25,593
and the other is actual competition.

5696
03:55:26,670 --> 03:55:29,070
Epic has never forced any developer

5697
03:55:29,070 --> 03:55:31,230
into any sort of exclusivity relationship.

5698
03:55:31,230 --> 03:55:35,850
Rather we've offered developers payment or incentives

5699
03:55:35,850 --> 03:55:38,640
or marketing or any number of things of value to them

5700
03:55:38,640 --> 03:55:41,430
in exchange for coming to our store exclusively.

5701
03:55:41,430 --> 03:55:43,260
And it's their game.

5702
03:55:43,260 --> 03:55:47,790
So it's entirely rightfully up to them

5703
03:55:47,790 --> 03:55:50,550
to decide how to distribute it

5704
03:55:50,550 --> 03:55:52,440
and to make the decisions about their business.

5705
03:55:52,440 --> 03:55:53,273
It's their game.

5706
03:55:53,273 --> 03:55:55,170
If they wanna distribute it through Steam, they can.

5707
03:55:55,170 --> 03:55:56,063
If they wanna distribute it

5708
03:55:56,063 --> 03:55:58,020
through Epic exclusively, they can.

5709
03:55:58,020 --> 03:56:00,390
If they wanna distribute it through both,

5710
03:56:00,390 --> 03:56:01,990
then they could do that as well.

5711
03:56:03,120 --> 03:56:04,440
And if we pay them money

5712
03:56:04,440 --> 03:56:06,360
or other things of value in exchange

5713
03:56:06,360 --> 03:56:08,490
for them coming exclusively to the Epic Game Store,

5714
03:56:08,490 --> 03:56:09,807
I think that's their right.

5715
03:56:09,807 --> 03:56:13,470
And this is an example of Epic, an underdog

5716
03:56:13,470 --> 03:56:15,960
with a tiny fraction of Steam's market share,

5717
03:56:15,960 --> 03:56:18,990
working to proactively compete with Steam

5718
03:56:18,990 --> 03:56:21,060
by offering a better supply of games.

5719
03:56:21,060 --> 03:56:24,210
And some consumers who prefer Steam might prefer

5720
03:56:24,210 --> 03:56:25,830
that the game be on Steam,

5721
03:56:25,830 --> 03:56:29,160
but the developer in each case has decided

5722
03:56:29,160 --> 03:56:31,260
that they believe they would benefit more

5723
03:56:31,260 --> 03:56:33,750
by doing this exclusive deal in exchange for benefits

5724
03:56:33,750 --> 03:56:35,460
than by being on Steam.

5725
03:56:35,460 --> 03:56:37,830
And you know, like one of the key exhibits

5726
03:56:37,830 --> 03:56:41,250
in the Epic-Google trial was it's opening exhibit,

5727
03:56:41,250 --> 03:56:46,250
which was trying to point out to the jury in the trial

5728
03:56:46,260 --> 03:56:47,970
the benefits of exclusives.

5729
03:56:47,970 --> 03:56:50,103
Like imagine a new store popping up.

5730
03:56:51,270 --> 03:56:53,017
The store has a big sign outside of it,

5731
03:56:53,017 --> 03:56:56,040
"We're the new store store, we have everything

5732
03:56:56,040 --> 03:56:58,950
that the other store has and it's at the same price."

5733
03:56:58,950 --> 03:57:01,620
Are you gonna go to the new store? No.

5734
03:57:01,620 --> 03:57:03,480
You know, nobody's gonna switch from Steam

5735
03:57:03,480 --> 03:57:06,180
if Steam has all of the same games as the competing store

5736
03:57:06,180 --> 03:57:08,640
and everything's priced just the same.

5737
03:57:08,640 --> 03:57:10,890
And so we looked at initially two ways

5738
03:57:10,890 --> 03:57:12,240
of competing with Steam strongly.

5739
03:57:12,240 --> 03:57:15,220
We wanted to sell BET games at a better price than Steam

5740
03:57:16,560 --> 03:57:18,630
by agreeing on the amount of money

5741
03:57:18,630 --> 03:57:21,401
we pay each game developer, you know,

5742
03:57:21,401 --> 03:57:24,240
if the game's gonna sell for $50 and we take 12%,

5743
03:57:24,240 --> 03:57:26,250
we'd actually lower the price

5744
03:57:26,250 --> 03:57:29,850
and potentially even lose some money to offer a better deal.

5745
03:57:29,850 --> 03:57:34,080
Well, you know, we tried to pursue this,

5746
03:57:34,080 --> 03:57:37,770
but very quickly every developer told us

5747
03:57:37,770 --> 03:57:40,020
that they wouldn't agree to better pricing

5748
03:57:40,020 --> 03:57:43,320
because if they did then Steam would stop giving them,

5749
03:57:43,320 --> 03:57:45,510
you know, marketing featuring and benefits

5750
03:57:45,510 --> 03:57:46,860
and the console makers would be mad

5751
03:57:46,860 --> 03:57:50,310
and all their relationships would be harmed,

5752
03:57:50,310 --> 03:57:54,450
you know, so there's an undercurrent of powerful platforms

5753
03:57:54,450 --> 03:57:56,550
and ecosystems encouraging developers

5754
03:57:56,550 --> 03:57:58,110
not to compete on price.

5755
03:57:58,110 --> 03:57:59,970
So not being able to compete on price,

5756
03:57:59,970 --> 03:58:03,120
we decided to compete on supply by doing exclusive deals

5757
03:58:03,120 --> 03:58:04,980
and we signed a lot of them,

5758
03:58:04,980 --> 03:58:06,473
paid developers lots and lots of money.

5759
03:58:06,473 --> 03:58:09,300
I think we distributed over a billion dollars

5760
03:58:09,300 --> 03:58:11,980
in net expenditures to developers beyond

5761
03:58:13,830 --> 03:58:15,330
the revenue we actually made from games

5762
03:58:15,330 --> 03:58:17,730
in order to get a whole lot of exclusive games.

5763
03:58:17,730 --> 03:58:19,237
Some are successful, some weren't.

5764
03:58:19,237 --> 03:58:21,737
"Borderlands" did awesomely on the Epic Games tour

5765
03:58:23,324 --> 03:58:26,640
and Gearbox felt that it did just as well through Epic

5766
03:58:26,640 --> 03:58:27,810
as it would've done on Steam

5767
03:58:27,810 --> 03:58:30,330
because you know, the players who wanted "Borderlands"

5768
03:58:30,330 --> 03:58:32,550
wanted "Borderlands" and they came and got it.

5769
03:58:32,550 --> 03:58:33,660
Whereas a lot of other games, you know,

5770
03:58:33,660 --> 03:58:34,980
some smaller games especially

5771
03:58:34,980 --> 03:58:36,540
that didn't have a dedicated audience

5772
03:58:36,540 --> 03:58:38,670
that was absolutely gonna play the game

5773
03:58:38,670 --> 03:58:40,830
typically benefited from exposure on Steam.

5774
03:58:40,830 --> 03:58:41,940
They were reaching an audience

5775
03:58:41,940 --> 03:58:43,410
that wouldn't have reached organically.

5776
03:58:43,410 --> 03:58:45,780
And so some of them in the end we

5777
03:58:45,780 --> 03:58:47,310
and they concluded that they did worse

5778
03:58:47,310 --> 03:58:49,740
by being on the Epic Game Store exclusively

5779
03:58:49,740 --> 03:58:52,650
in terms of, you know, reaching fewer customers.

5780
03:58:52,650 --> 03:58:53,483
And so, you know,

5781
03:58:53,483 --> 03:58:55,440
we had these limited time exclusives,

5782
03:58:55,440 --> 03:58:57,270
when they ran out, they put their games on Steam

5783
03:58:57,270 --> 03:58:59,190
and you know, lots of data was gathered

5784
03:58:59,190 --> 03:59:00,660
to understand what worked.

5785
03:59:00,660 --> 03:59:02,130
And so this worked well for some games,

5786
03:59:02,130 --> 03:59:03,330
didn't work for other games.

5787
03:59:03,330 --> 03:59:06,700
But you know, companies

5788
03:59:07,740 --> 03:59:09,750
seeking to compete,

5789
03:59:09,750 --> 03:59:11,700
especially underdogs seeking to compete,

5790
03:59:11,700 --> 03:59:14,250
have to offer some unique value, have to offer something

5791
03:59:14,250 --> 03:59:17,370
that's not available through their competitors.

5792
03:59:17,370 --> 03:59:19,530
And I get that Steam users who just prefer using Steam

5793
03:59:19,530 --> 03:59:21,480
and buying games on Steam and wanna have their library

5794
03:59:21,480 --> 03:59:22,830
in one place don't like this.

5795
03:59:22,830 --> 03:59:24,720
But you're never gonna have competition

5796
03:59:24,720 --> 03:59:27,120
for better deals if you don't support

5797
03:59:27,120 --> 03:59:28,530
the competitive mechanisms

5798
03:59:28,530 --> 03:59:30,690
that allow competitors to come about.

5799
03:59:30,690 --> 03:59:32,640
And I think if Valve were forced

5800
03:59:32,640 --> 03:59:34,620
through Epic Game Store's success to compete

5801
03:59:34,620 --> 03:59:36,630
with Epic Game Store, then developers would be getting

5802
03:59:36,630 --> 03:59:39,540
a better deal, consumers would be getting a better deal

5803
03:59:39,540 --> 03:59:41,940
and these 30% fees would be driven down

5804
03:59:41,940 --> 03:59:44,460
quite a lot towards the actual costs

5805
03:59:44,460 --> 03:59:46,590
that are required to support the stores.

5806
03:59:46,590 --> 03:59:49,113
- Yeah, I mean there's a lot to be said there.

5807
03:59:50,490 --> 03:59:53,460
You know, I've gotten to watch Spotify

5808
03:59:53,460 --> 03:59:57,120
try to do this with podcasts, you know,

5809
03:59:57,120 --> 03:59:59,400
enter as the underdog into the space

5810
03:59:59,400 --> 04:00:02,460
and try to attract, you know, they made exclusive deals

5811
04:00:02,460 --> 04:00:04,830
with, for example, for Joe Rogan

5812
04:00:04,830 --> 04:00:08,493
where the podcast would only be published on Spotify.

5813
04:00:09,420 --> 04:00:13,140
I personally think long term what I would love to see

5814
04:00:13,140 --> 04:00:17,853
for EGS for Epic Game Store is to not do any exclusivity.

5815
04:00:19,230 --> 04:00:21,120
Similar to what Spotify's doing now.

5816
04:00:21,120 --> 04:00:25,050
Even with Joe Rogan, they let go, it's wide open.

5817
04:00:25,050 --> 04:00:28,900
And instead compete on the space of just

5818
04:00:30,570 --> 04:00:33,220
the non-clunkiness of the interface

5819
04:00:34,080 --> 04:00:37,600
because the foundation of what

5820
04:00:38,640 --> 04:00:41,970
Epic games still represent with 12%,

5821
04:00:41,970 --> 04:00:43,770
it's just philosophically.

5822
04:00:43,770 --> 04:00:47,250
So you're also competing on the sort of spiritual realm

5823
04:00:47,250 --> 04:00:49,470
of like what it stands for, ethically.

5824
04:00:49,470 --> 04:00:52,890
That's also a really powerful way to win.

5825
04:00:52,890 --> 04:00:56,460
So now that there's enough number of people

5826
04:00:56,460 --> 04:01:00,240
using at the Epic Game Store, like to drift away,

5827
04:01:00,240 --> 04:01:02,580
to move away from exclusivity.

5828
04:01:02,580 --> 04:01:05,040
It's understandable that it's needed for the competition

5829
04:01:05,040 --> 04:01:08,370
for the underdog to enter the scene.

5830
04:01:08,370 --> 04:01:10,713
But it goes against the sort of the freedom,

5831
04:01:11,880 --> 04:01:14,640
the free spirit of choice that I think you represent

5832
04:01:14,640 --> 04:01:16,530
in a lot of the decisions you've made,

5833
04:01:16,530 --> 04:01:19,140
which is making the games cross platform.

5834
04:01:19,140 --> 04:01:23,340
And just yes, giving freedom to the developers,

5835
04:01:23,340 --> 04:01:26,400
giving freedom to the gamers to choose.

5836
04:01:26,400 --> 04:01:28,590
So in that way I think exclusivity a little bit

5837
04:01:28,590 --> 04:01:29,523
goes against that.

5838
04:01:30,660 --> 04:01:34,830
- Well here's the conundrum, the exercise of soft power

5839
04:01:34,830 --> 04:01:36,820
by all of the competing stores

5840
04:01:38,130 --> 04:01:41,850
has made it intractable for almost any developer

5841
04:01:41,850 --> 04:01:43,530
to offer a better price

5842
04:01:43,530 --> 04:01:45,870
through the Epic Game Store than through Steam.

5843
04:01:45,870 --> 04:01:48,840
You can imagine that if the effective Epic revenue

5844
04:01:48,840 --> 04:01:51,480
sharing 12% to developers was

5845
04:01:51,480 --> 04:01:55,590
that games just cost 22% less on Epic Games,

5846
04:01:55,590 --> 04:01:57,843
sorry 18% less on Epic Game Store.

5847
04:01:59,370 --> 04:02:00,203
That would actually start

5848
04:02:00,203 --> 04:02:02,220
to reshape consumer behavior significantly.

5849
04:02:02,220 --> 04:02:04,710
People would start coming here for the better deals.

5850
04:02:04,710 --> 04:02:06,137
But I feel like Steam, you know,

5851
04:02:06,137 --> 04:02:08,070
giving developers nasty phone calls

5852
04:02:08,070 --> 04:02:11,250
and so on, when they propose to do that

5853
04:02:11,250 --> 04:02:14,163
prevents developers from passing on savings to consumer,

5854
04:02:15,450 --> 04:02:20,130
then what's the mechanism that drives users away

5855
04:02:20,130 --> 04:02:22,080
from the incumbent store to the store

5856
04:02:22,080 --> 04:02:23,790
that offers a better deal.

5857
04:02:23,790 --> 04:02:28,170
If basically developers are fearful of competing on price

5858
04:02:28,170 --> 04:02:30,420
through stores, you know,

5859
04:02:30,420 --> 04:02:33,840
what can possibly be done to get a dominant store with,

5860
04:02:33,840 --> 04:02:37,650
you know, something like 90% of revenue share from,

5861
04:02:37,650 --> 04:02:40,893
you know, multi publisher stores,

5862
04:02:42,750 --> 04:02:45,690
you know, in line so that a much,

5863
04:02:45,690 --> 04:02:47,430
much smaller store can compete.

5864
04:02:47,430 --> 04:02:49,353
I think some answers required there.

5865
04:02:50,370 --> 04:02:51,870
A better UI is great.

5866
04:02:51,870 --> 04:02:53,070
Like Steam is super polished.

5867
04:02:53,070 --> 04:02:54,570
Epic Game Store and you know,

5868
04:02:54,570 --> 04:02:56,463
time will hopefully be as polished.

5869
04:02:57,630 --> 04:03:00,810
You know, how does that overcome the fact

5870
04:03:00,810 --> 04:03:04,590
that your entire library over the past 15 years is there.

5871
04:03:04,590 --> 04:03:06,420
If developers have been afraid

5872
04:03:06,420 --> 04:03:08,280
to exercise their own economic interest

5873
04:03:08,280 --> 04:03:10,500
because there's own developer's interest to sell on Epic

5874
04:03:10,500 --> 04:03:14,493
and you know, 18% more of the revenue.

5875
04:03:15,780 --> 04:03:19,200
You know, I think there's a real power to incumbents.

5876
04:03:19,200 --> 04:03:23,190
It's very hard to overcome through just being there

5877
04:03:23,190 --> 04:03:24,990
and being as good.

5878
04:03:24,990 --> 04:03:29,310
- Ultimately, where I hope it converges to

5879
04:03:29,310 --> 04:03:31,293
is less exclusivity.

5880
04:03:32,541 --> 04:03:36,240
And where the competition can be the kind I love the most,

5881
04:03:36,240 --> 04:03:37,653
which is on the UI,

5882
04:03:41,125 --> 04:03:43,490
on the experience, on the just...

5883
04:03:45,060 --> 04:03:48,360
And then on the Steam side, on the 12%.

5884
04:03:48,360 --> 04:03:49,890
So it can go from 30%

5885
04:03:49,890 --> 04:03:52,770
and start to support the developer

5886
04:03:52,770 --> 04:03:55,980
by lowering it from 30% closer to 12%.

5887
04:03:55,980 --> 04:03:59,370
So anyway, I'm a big supporter

5888
04:03:59,370 --> 04:04:02,970
and I don't like the criticism of Epic Game Store,

5889
04:04:02,970 --> 04:04:05,730
but I also have to say that I don't love the exclusivity

5890
04:04:05,730 --> 04:04:06,843
but I understand.

5891
04:04:07,680 --> 04:04:09,570
I understand the reality of the world is

5892
04:04:09,570 --> 04:04:14,040
that you have to have some mechanism to get people

5893
04:04:14,040 --> 04:04:15,690
to switch or not to switch

5894
04:04:15,690 --> 04:04:20,010
but to at least get some of their games to try out,

5895
04:04:20,010 --> 04:04:24,150
to experience, to allocate some of their library

5896
04:04:24,150 --> 04:04:25,440
to the underdog.

5897
04:04:25,440 --> 04:04:27,030
So I totally understand.

5898
04:04:27,030 --> 04:04:29,706
And hope the UI keeps improving.

5899
04:04:29,706 --> 04:04:30,630
(Tim laughing)

5900
04:04:30,630 --> 04:04:34,470
- Thanks, one more bit on that exclusivity point

5901
04:04:34,470 --> 04:04:36,900
is that when we told Google that we were going

5902
04:04:36,900 --> 04:04:38,820
to launch "Fortnite" outside of Google Play

5903
04:04:38,820 --> 04:04:42,900
and go into competition with them, they viewed exclusivity

5904
04:04:42,900 --> 04:04:46,200
as such a powerful competitive force

5905
04:04:46,200 --> 04:04:49,710
that they went around to the top 30 publishers

5906
04:04:49,710 --> 04:04:53,400
and paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to them

5907
04:04:53,400 --> 04:04:56,970
in order to agree not to do exclusive deals

5908
04:04:56,970 --> 04:04:58,113
with competitors.

5909
04:04:59,370 --> 04:05:03,630
And that was called Project HUG, H-U-G

5910
04:05:03,630 --> 04:05:04,923
Hold developers Close.

5911
04:05:07,050 --> 04:05:11,880
And that was one of the major pieces of evidence

5912
04:05:11,880 --> 04:05:13,770
on which the jury found their practices

5913
04:05:13,770 --> 04:05:16,530
to be illegal and anti-competitive.

5914
04:05:16,530 --> 04:05:18,030
And the one more data point on that,

5915
04:05:18,030 --> 04:05:19,410
you know, we talk about 30%

5916
04:05:19,410 --> 04:05:21,510
and there's always a lot of people defending Steam.

5917
04:05:21,510 --> 04:05:22,590
Well of course they have more costs

5918
04:05:22,590 --> 04:05:24,660
because they have more features than Epic.

5919
04:05:24,660 --> 04:05:27,420
We have data on that's very detailed.

5920
04:05:27,420 --> 04:05:30,513
The all in cost of operating the Google Play store,

5921
04:05:31,740 --> 04:05:34,170
stocking it, maintaining it, the software,

5922
04:05:34,170 --> 04:05:38,880
the entire ecosystem is around 6% of revenue.

5923
04:05:38,880 --> 04:05:42,240
So you know, in a competitive market,

5924
04:05:42,240 --> 04:05:44,670
what a company whose cost is 6%,

5925
04:05:44,670 --> 04:05:49,590
people to charge 30%, like absolutely not.

5926
04:05:49,590 --> 04:05:50,760
And Apple's costs are similar.

5927
04:05:50,760 --> 04:05:52,200
Apple runs an even more efficient

5928
04:05:52,200 --> 04:05:53,640
and lean operation than Google.

5929
04:05:53,640 --> 04:05:58,290
So their costs are also likely in the range of 6% all in.

5930
04:05:58,290 --> 04:06:01,020
They mark it up from 6% to 30%.

5931
04:06:01,020 --> 04:06:02,973
Like only a monopoly can do that.

5932
04:06:03,930 --> 04:06:05,220
Look at competitive businesses,

5933
04:06:05,220 --> 04:06:07,440
they have a margin of a few percentage.

5934
04:06:07,440 --> 04:06:11,700
The numbers there are strikingly supportive

5935
04:06:11,700 --> 04:06:16,350
of just outright anti-competitive distortions.

5936
04:06:16,350 --> 04:06:17,889
- Okay, what do you think

5937
04:06:17,889 --> 04:06:19,440
is the future of the gaming industry?

5938
04:06:19,440 --> 04:06:22,590
So we've said to me a bunch of exciting stuff

5939
04:06:22,590 --> 04:06:24,810
about indie developers so, you know,

5940
04:06:24,810 --> 04:06:28,620
do what are called AAA video game companies,

5941
04:06:28,620 --> 04:06:32,370
so these big gaming companies, do they have a future?

5942
04:06:32,370 --> 04:06:34,020
What is their role?

5943
04:06:34,020 --> 04:06:37,230
How do you see like in the next 5, 10, 20 years

5944
04:06:37,230 --> 04:06:42,230
the evolution of these big companies and indie developers?

5945
04:06:42,300 --> 04:06:44,520
- Yeah, there's one constant in gaming

5946
04:06:44,520 --> 04:06:46,500
that I think the industry manages to lose sight of

5947
04:06:46,500 --> 04:06:49,890
from time to time astonishingly and that's fun

5948
04:06:49,890 --> 04:06:51,660
and people play games for fun.

5949
04:06:51,660 --> 04:06:53,400
Our whole job is to deliver fun.

5950
04:06:53,400 --> 04:06:55,590
And when you look at a lot of the games

5951
04:06:55,590 --> 04:07:00,330
that failed recently, they just didn't deliver fun

5952
04:07:00,330 --> 04:07:02,220
or they didn't deliver fun in a manner

5953
04:07:02,220 --> 04:07:03,420
that was nearly competitive

5954
04:07:03,420 --> 04:07:07,140
with the other sources of fun just in people's lives.

5955
04:07:07,140 --> 04:07:09,120
And so, you know,

5956
04:07:09,120 --> 04:07:11,940
at a basic level we don't need a terribly complicated theory

5957
04:07:11,940 --> 04:07:14,820
to explain a lot of the malas in the game industry.

5958
04:07:14,820 --> 04:07:17,130
There's just been a degradation of the capabilities

5959
04:07:17,130 --> 04:07:19,050
of a lot of publishers,

5960
04:07:19,050 --> 04:07:21,210
partly because of competition for talent.

5961
04:07:21,210 --> 04:07:24,210
You know, companies like really vibrant game businesses

5962
04:07:24,210 --> 04:07:28,290
like Epic or Riot or others are hiring the best developers

5963
04:07:28,290 --> 04:07:30,240
and accumulating them and big tech companies are hiring

5964
04:07:30,240 --> 04:07:32,127
the best game developers 'cause there's super talent there.

5965
04:07:32,127 --> 04:07:35,880
And so in some cases the companies aren't competing

5966
04:07:35,880 --> 04:07:37,170
robustly or getting worse.

5967
04:07:37,170 --> 04:07:38,640
They're making games that are less fun.

5968
04:07:38,640 --> 04:07:40,890
And you know, I think everything else

5969
04:07:40,890 --> 04:07:43,983
that's happened is kind of a side show to that.

5970
04:07:45,110 --> 04:07:46,410
You know, there's always political drama and so,

5971
04:07:46,410 --> 04:07:49,860
and I think the core is of failure to deliver fun.

5972
04:07:49,860 --> 04:07:52,050
And you know, the nature of fun is changing.

5973
04:07:52,050 --> 04:07:54,630
It turns out that playing a game together

5974
04:07:54,630 --> 04:07:56,250
with your friends in a really socially

5975
04:07:56,250 --> 04:07:59,700
and engaging way with voice chat is just way more fun

5976
04:07:59,700 --> 04:08:02,490
than playing a solitary game for the most part.

5977
04:08:02,490 --> 04:08:04,590
And there are exceptions to that,

5978
04:08:04,590 --> 04:08:06,420
but I think we're seeing much, much play time

5979
04:08:06,420 --> 04:08:08,280
shifting towards games you're playing

5980
04:08:08,280 --> 04:08:09,240
together with your friends.

5981
04:08:09,240 --> 04:08:12,240
And not just random internet strangers who happen to play

5982
04:08:12,240 --> 04:08:13,911
that game too, but the people actually

5983
04:08:13,911 --> 04:08:15,900
you know in the real world.

5984
04:08:15,900 --> 04:08:17,400
And that's certainly been the case with me

5985
04:08:17,400 --> 04:08:19,417
and with almost everybody I know who's playing

5986
04:08:19,417 --> 04:08:21,300
"Fortnite" or similar games.

5987
04:08:21,300 --> 04:08:24,090
And that has really significant effect in reshaping

5988
04:08:24,090 --> 04:08:25,560
the whole game business.

5989
04:08:25,560 --> 04:08:27,999
Because like a single player game,

5990
04:08:27,999 --> 04:08:30,150
if you have 20 people with 20 different opinions

5991
04:08:30,150 --> 04:08:31,963
of which game to play, each one might buy

5992
04:08:31,963 --> 04:08:33,810
a different single player game.

5993
04:08:33,810 --> 04:08:37,497
But in a multiplayer game, if there are 20 games out

5994
04:08:37,497 --> 04:08:40,110
and each one might have their own completely individual

5995
04:08:40,110 --> 04:08:42,030
preference and each one or independently choosing

5996
04:08:42,030 --> 04:08:45,153
which game to play, each one might buy a different game.

5997
04:08:46,350 --> 04:08:48,390
But they're all realizing that they wanna play together.

5998
04:08:48,390 --> 04:08:51,970
And so what players are doing increasingly is playing

5999
04:08:53,640 --> 04:08:56,550
a game they like and accept together with their friends,

6000
04:08:56,550 --> 04:08:59,550
even if it's not the game that every one of them

6001
04:08:59,550 --> 04:09:01,680
might be preferring to play themselves.

6002
04:09:01,680 --> 04:09:03,690
Like if you have, and you know,

6003
04:09:03,690 --> 04:09:06,180
that's certainly the case in, you know,

6004
04:09:06,180 --> 04:09:08,310
different "Fortnite" groups I play with from time to time.

6005
04:09:08,310 --> 04:09:10,440
It's like, you know, one player might have been preferring

6006
04:09:10,440 --> 04:09:11,700
to play "COD", one might have been

6007
04:09:11,700 --> 04:09:13,470
preferring "League of Legends,"

6008
04:09:13,470 --> 04:09:15,030
somebody else, something completely random,

6009
04:09:15,030 --> 04:09:18,078
but it's just so fun to play together, we're doing that.

6010
04:09:18,078 --> 04:09:19,920
And that means that there's really strong

6011
04:09:19,920 --> 04:09:22,470
Metcalfe's law effect in games

6012
04:09:22,470 --> 04:09:24,510
which are able to attract a large percentage

6013
04:09:24,510 --> 04:09:27,630
of your friends are more able to attract you

6014
04:09:27,630 --> 04:09:30,303
and not only attract, but also retain.

6015
04:09:31,140 --> 04:09:33,660
And so, you know, I think Matthew Ball's analysis

6016
04:09:33,660 --> 04:09:36,240
of this over the years has really documented

6017
04:09:36,240 --> 04:09:38,820
the trend towards, you know, you can call it the metaverse

6018
04:09:38,820 --> 04:09:42,260
or you can call it large scale multiplayer social gaming.

6019
04:09:42,260 --> 04:09:43,740
He is really documented this trend

6020
04:09:43,740 --> 04:09:46,530
and you know, over the past year or so it's taken a really,

6021
04:09:46,530 --> 04:09:49,590
really strong turn towards increasing rate of change,

6022
04:09:49,590 --> 04:09:52,180
increasing numbers of players coming to "Fortnite."

6023
04:09:52,180 --> 04:09:53,480
You know, we hit an all time high

6024
04:09:53,480 --> 04:09:57,435
of 110 million monthly active users about a year ago.

6025
04:09:57,435 --> 04:09:58,761
(Lex laughing)

6026
04:09:58,761 --> 04:09:59,760
- That's crazy. - And another

6027
04:09:59,760 --> 04:10:01,597
like close to peak this time.

6028
04:10:01,597 --> 04:10:03,150
"Roblox" is bigger than ever.

6029
04:10:03,150 --> 04:10:05,760
And you know, this trend is players consolidating

6030
04:10:05,760 --> 04:10:08,670
into multi-player experiences of play together.

6031
04:10:08,670 --> 04:10:10,320
And we're seeing another trend overlaid with that,

6032
04:10:10,320 --> 04:10:13,380
which is like when an awesome single player game comes out

6033
04:10:13,380 --> 04:10:14,940
or a small multi-player game comes out,

6034
04:10:14,940 --> 04:10:16,860
people often will like treat it as a vacation.

6035
04:10:16,860 --> 04:10:18,090
They'll go off and play that game for a while,

6036
04:10:18,090 --> 04:10:19,290
then come back.

6037
04:10:19,290 --> 04:10:21,360
And I think "Wukong" was an awesome example of

6038
04:10:21,360 --> 04:10:24,120
that wonderful game from a brilliant team.

6039
04:10:24,120 --> 04:10:26,760
In China they made a game that's like,

6040
04:10:26,760 --> 04:10:28,200
no western players had really seen

6041
04:10:28,200 --> 04:10:29,730
that type of thing done before.

6042
04:10:29,730 --> 04:10:31,410
And it was awesome and it did well,

6043
04:10:31,410 --> 04:10:35,280
but most players play it for a while and move back on.

6044
04:10:35,280 --> 04:10:36,240
And that could be lucrative.

6045
04:10:36,240 --> 04:10:37,980
But a business that's building that kind of game,

6046
04:10:37,980 --> 04:10:40,945
it's gonna have to build a new one every few years

6047
04:10:40,945 --> 04:10:43,290
and build a business around that while the other games

6048
04:10:43,290 --> 04:10:45,660
continue to accrete users.

6049
04:10:45,660 --> 04:10:48,940
But you know, when you have a large number of gamers

6050
04:10:50,010 --> 04:10:51,930
migrating to a small number of games,

6051
04:10:51,930 --> 04:10:55,590
the effect of that is increasing revenue for those games,

6052
04:10:55,590 --> 04:10:57,003
increasing reinvestment.

6053
04:10:57,960 --> 04:10:59,610
And you know, there are things that Epic can do

6054
04:10:59,610 --> 04:11:03,180
with a team of thousands of people building "Fortnite."

6055
04:11:03,180 --> 04:11:06,570
Internally and tens of thousands contributing to "Fortnite"

6056
04:11:06,570 --> 04:11:07,983
as independent creators.

6057
04:11:08,940 --> 04:11:10,230
You know, there are just things that can happen

6058
04:11:10,230 --> 04:11:11,310
with that level of investment

6059
04:11:11,310 --> 04:11:13,377
that can't happen in a smaller game.

6060
04:11:13,377 --> 04:11:16,050
And so there's somewhat of an increasing

6061
04:11:16,050 --> 04:11:17,130
winner take all dynamic

6062
04:11:17,130 --> 04:11:18,720
where the biggest games reinvest more

6063
04:11:18,720 --> 04:11:19,800
to make their games more fun,

6064
04:11:19,800 --> 04:11:21,990
to gain fun at a faster rate than other games.

6065
04:11:21,990 --> 04:11:25,170
And you know, the industry is changing around that.

6066
04:11:25,170 --> 04:11:27,930
And you know, so I think the lesson for the game industry

6067
04:11:27,930 --> 04:11:31,020
now is that there are really two big opportunities

6068
04:11:31,020 --> 04:11:31,853
being pursued.

6069
04:11:31,853 --> 04:11:33,780
There's big games or games that have the potential

6070
04:11:33,780 --> 04:11:35,610
to be really big multiplayer experiences

6071
04:11:35,610 --> 04:11:38,430
that keep players around, you know, indefinitely

6072
04:11:38,430 --> 04:11:39,963
for very long periods of time.

6073
04:11:40,800 --> 04:11:42,930
And then there are just really good single player

6074
04:11:42,930 --> 04:11:44,100
and small scale games

6075
04:11:44,100 --> 04:11:46,920
that people are taking a break from their big games for.

6076
04:11:46,920 --> 04:11:48,300
And you know, the trend there is going

6077
04:11:48,300 --> 04:11:50,460
to be towards efficiently developing those games.

6078
04:11:50,460 --> 04:11:52,020
You can't build one of those games

6079
04:11:52,020 --> 04:11:53,550
with a $300 million budget,

6080
04:11:53,550 --> 04:11:55,920
but if you can do it with a $40 million budget,

6081
04:11:55,920 --> 04:11:57,840
you can make a lot of money.

6082
04:11:57,840 --> 04:11:59,760
So I think that's the main reshaping going on

6083
04:11:59,760 --> 04:12:02,670
and I think that it creates a rather bleak outlook

6084
04:12:02,670 --> 04:12:06,210
for a lot of the category of like single player games

6085
04:12:06,210 --> 04:12:08,643
that don't have a huge audience to reach.

6086
04:12:10,740 --> 04:12:12,480
But this is just one of the really trends

6087
04:12:12,480 --> 04:12:14,850
of restructuring the business around

6088
04:12:14,850 --> 04:12:17,220
the technology and changes of the day.

6089
04:12:17,220 --> 04:12:18,780
- Okay, this is gonna be a ridiculous question,

6090
04:12:18,780 --> 04:12:22,740
but aside from the games you've created,

6091
04:12:22,740 --> 04:12:25,050
what are some of the greatest video games

6092
04:12:25,050 --> 04:12:26,910
ever created to you?

6093
04:12:26,910 --> 04:12:29,080
Like what video games have been like

6094
04:12:31,080 --> 04:12:33,180
either impactful to you in your life

6095
04:12:33,180 --> 04:12:35,250
or maybe you've seen created

6096
04:12:35,250 --> 04:12:38,640
and you're like, "Huh, that's a beautiful art piece."

6097
04:12:38,640 --> 04:12:40,740
Like it could be in a totally different realm.

6098
04:12:40,740 --> 04:12:44,370
Like obviously for me, I returned too often

6099
04:12:44,370 --> 04:12:47,300
to the single player domain of role playing games.

6100
04:12:47,300 --> 04:12:49,440
Of the "Elder Scroll" series, "Skyrim",

6101
04:12:49,440 --> 04:12:51,900
that was like a world that they created.

6102
04:12:51,900 --> 04:12:54,990
A recent game, "Baldurs Gate 3",

6103
04:12:54,990 --> 04:12:58,230
that was really incredible piece of work and art

6104
04:12:58,230 --> 04:13:00,780
and doing a lot of innovative stuff

6105
04:13:00,780 --> 04:13:03,360
again in the single player domain.

6106
04:13:03,360 --> 04:13:06,393
Is there games like that outside the ones you've created?

6107
04:13:07,290 --> 04:13:11,340
- I'm most impressed with the games that have created

6108
04:13:11,340 --> 04:13:13,953
what appears to be a full living, breathing world.

6109
04:13:16,140 --> 04:13:19,110
You know, games that give you the sense that

6110
04:13:19,110 --> 04:13:21,120
you're just a part of it and there's a lot more happening

6111
04:13:21,120 --> 04:13:23,583
and there's, you know, always more.

6112
04:13:25,486 --> 04:13:27,960
And you know, gives you the sense that you could go anywhere

6113
04:13:27,960 --> 04:13:29,040
and do anything.

6114
04:13:29,040 --> 04:13:31,590
Even though these games really do have finite limitations

6115
04:13:31,590 --> 04:13:32,790
and there are places you can't go.

6116
04:13:32,790 --> 04:13:36,060
It really creating that sense of wonder

6117
04:13:36,060 --> 04:13:37,560
is just a magical thing.

6118
04:13:37,560 --> 04:13:40,020
Like "Zelda: Breath of the Wild,"

6119
04:13:40,020 --> 04:13:41,857
yeah "Skyrim," "Red Dead Redemption"

6120
04:13:41,857 --> 04:13:43,622
- [Lex] "Red Dead" is great, yeah.

6121
04:13:43,622 --> 04:13:46,991
- It's like there's an entire ecology simulator in there.

6122
04:13:46,991 --> 04:13:48,120
I have a high school classmate

6123
04:13:48,120 --> 04:13:49,920
that got into studying river ecology

6124
04:13:49,920 --> 04:13:51,370
and he was commenting on like

6125
04:13:52,297 --> 04:13:53,130
"This is one of the very few games

6126
04:13:53,130 --> 04:13:54,987
that's hydrologically sound."

6127
04:13:56,010 --> 04:13:57,630
The way, like they actually went to the effort

6128
04:13:57,630 --> 04:13:58,680
of shaping the rivers

6129
04:13:58,680 --> 04:14:01,390
to follow like erosion dynamics and so on.

6130
04:14:01,390 --> 04:14:03,900
It is the attention to detail.

6131
04:14:03,900 --> 04:14:05,250
There's something there, it's big,

6132
04:14:05,250 --> 04:14:08,910
and it's been funny through the industry.

6133
04:14:08,910 --> 04:14:12,240
Like I last designed a game in 1992,

6134
04:14:12,240 --> 04:14:13,653
I'm not a game designer.

6135
04:14:14,820 --> 04:14:16,650
Yeah, I have a very open-minded

6136
04:14:16,650 --> 04:14:20,580
like the best game genre that will ever exist

6137
04:14:20,580 --> 04:14:21,963
has not yet been invented.

6138
04:14:22,938 --> 04:14:27,120
And as we get more technological capabilities

6139
04:14:27,120 --> 04:14:29,643
and creatives, people use that to,

6140
04:14:30,501 --> 04:14:31,620
and you know, hopefully empowered

6141
04:14:31,620 --> 04:14:34,260
by higher productivity tools and so on that will see more

6142
04:14:34,260 --> 04:14:35,340
and more cool things emerge

6143
04:14:35,340 --> 04:14:37,677
that we'd never dreamed possible.

6144
04:14:37,677 --> 04:14:38,940
And you know, the idea of a world simulator

6145
04:14:38,940 --> 04:14:40,790
is actually really interesting there.

6146
04:14:41,880 --> 04:14:42,810
It's been tried a lot.

6147
04:14:42,810 --> 04:14:44,670
It's, you know, usually extremely slow

6148
04:14:44,670 --> 04:14:45,630
and expensive to create,

6149
04:14:45,630 --> 04:14:47,520
but over time maybe we'll get better at that

6150
04:14:47,520 --> 04:14:49,050
and that will be a thing too.

6151
04:14:49,050 --> 04:14:51,270
- You said so many interesting things there.

6152
04:14:51,270 --> 04:14:53,197
New city builders. - [Tim] Yeah.

6153
04:14:53,197 --> 04:14:55,530
"Civilization," it's a mind boggling

6154
04:14:55,530 --> 04:14:57,630
they built a game with that depth that can evolve

6155
04:14:57,630 --> 04:14:59,820
so dependent on your actions.

6156
04:14:59,820 --> 04:15:03,510
- To do that scale of world,

6157
04:15:03,510 --> 04:15:06,150
but to where you can step into it

6158
04:15:06,150 --> 04:15:08,460
and be in it, you know.

6159
04:15:08,460 --> 04:15:11,370
I think "Red Dead" is a great example,

6160
04:15:11,370 --> 04:15:14,481
but to do "Red Dead" redemption in a way

6161
04:15:14,481 --> 04:15:19,113
where you can walk around with friends at a large scale.

6162
04:15:20,460 --> 04:15:24,720
And I guess what you have given

6163
04:15:24,720 --> 04:15:26,700
so many years to is creating the tools

6164
04:15:26,700 --> 04:15:30,600
that enable the artists to give that attention to detail

6165
04:15:30,600 --> 04:15:34,500
that "Red Dead" does on several of the things.

6166
04:15:34,500 --> 04:15:37,353
And once you do, there's something magical about that.

6167
04:15:40,072 --> 04:15:42,870
Like once you give that attention to detail,

6168
04:15:42,870 --> 04:15:44,640
like, I don't know what it is,

6169
04:15:44,640 --> 04:15:47,620
but the love of the artist comes through somehow

6170
04:15:48,819 --> 04:15:52,170
and you could feel the care that they put into it.

6171
04:15:52,170 --> 04:15:53,730
- That's right, the best games of a soul.

6172
04:15:53,730 --> 04:15:55,571
You can really sense it.

6173
04:15:55,571 --> 04:15:57,360
You know, like "Call of Duty" has a very different soul

6174
04:15:57,360 --> 04:15:59,610
than "Fortnite" and it just kind of exudes not only

6175
04:15:59,610 --> 04:16:00,690
in what you see in the game,

6176
04:16:00,690 --> 04:16:02,550
but also in how players interact with it

6177
04:16:02,550 --> 04:16:05,149
and interact with each other online.

6178
04:16:05,149 --> 04:16:06,090
And that's a really fascinating thing

6179
04:16:06,090 --> 04:16:07,739
I wish would be studied more.

6180
04:16:07,739 --> 04:16:09,810
(Lex laughing)

6181
04:16:09,810 --> 04:16:12,840
- I think we talked about the soul on several fronts, right?

6182
04:16:12,840 --> 04:16:14,460
I wish it would be studied more.

6183
04:16:14,460 --> 04:16:18,090
- Yeah, yeah, all game design decisions

6184
04:16:18,090 --> 04:16:23,090
the designers make have a profound impact on what players

6185
04:16:23,100 --> 04:16:24,825
think of the game and seeing the game.

6186
04:16:24,825 --> 04:16:26,160
You know, "Fortnite: Battle Royale"

6187
04:16:26,160 --> 04:16:27,540
always had a sense of mystery to it.

6188
04:16:27,540 --> 04:16:28,860
You're on this island but you're not sure

6189
04:16:28,860 --> 04:16:29,940
exactly what's happening here.

6190
04:16:29,940 --> 04:16:32,850
There are all these houses, they're abandoned, why?

6191
04:16:32,850 --> 04:16:36,600
And you know, I'm not the secret holder,

6192
04:16:36,600 --> 04:16:38,280
you know, I'm not on the design team.

6193
04:16:38,280 --> 04:16:39,900
I experienced "Fortnite" as a player,

6194
04:16:39,900 --> 04:16:41,967
but it really exudes a lot of that

6195
04:16:41,967 --> 04:16:44,880
and a good spiritedness as well

6196
04:16:44,880 --> 04:16:47,100
'cause even when you're eliminated in "Fortnite," you know,

6197
04:16:47,100 --> 04:16:50,250
there's not like blood spurts and there's not jibs.

6198
04:16:50,250 --> 04:16:52,830
You're just, you know, teleported out of the simulation

6199
04:16:52,830 --> 04:16:55,740
and often, you know, you end up losing the game in a way

6200
04:16:55,740 --> 04:16:57,660
that's hilarious enough to like,

6201
04:16:57,660 --> 04:16:58,680
actually you're laughing at it

6202
04:16:58,680 --> 04:17:00,540
or you're like, respect to that player

6203
04:17:00,540 --> 04:17:02,390
who just won because that was clever.

6204
04:17:03,450 --> 04:17:05,130
And you know, it creates a very different dynamic

6205
04:17:05,130 --> 04:17:06,480
than these other games where players

6206
04:17:06,480 --> 04:17:09,720
tend to be very, very positive towards each other.

6207
04:17:09,720 --> 04:17:11,045
One of the things I like to do in "Fortnite,"

6208
04:17:11,045 --> 04:17:13,710
just to kind of gauge how the game is going

6209
04:17:13,710 --> 04:17:14,837
is I play full squads

6210
04:17:14,837 --> 04:17:16,680
so you get match made with the, you know,

6211
04:17:16,680 --> 04:17:19,110
three other random players and play a game together.

6212
04:17:19,110 --> 04:17:21,371
Sometimes they have voice chat, sometimes they don't.

6213
04:17:21,371 --> 04:17:24,150
And you know, back when our matchmaking regions were bigger,

6214
04:17:24,150 --> 04:17:26,460
I learned a little bit of like battlefield Spanish

6215
04:17:26,460 --> 04:17:28,402
so I could speak with the people who were down.

6216
04:17:28,402 --> 04:17:29,820
- [Lex] Battlefield Spanish - As far south as, yeah.

6217
04:17:29,820 --> 04:17:33,780
Mexico City, and you know, the positivity

6218
04:17:33,780 --> 04:17:37,110
of the interactions there among just every kind of person

6219
04:17:37,110 --> 04:17:39,540
you might ever meet online were really quite impressive

6220
04:17:39,540 --> 04:17:41,340
and completely unlike what you would see in a game

6221
04:17:41,340 --> 04:17:42,173
like "Call of Duty",

6222
04:17:42,173 --> 04:17:44,160
where it's always, you know,

6223
04:17:44,160 --> 04:17:46,237
everybody's gotta be an Edge Lord.

6224
04:17:46,237 --> 04:17:48,540
(Lex laughing)

6225
04:17:48,540 --> 04:17:53,190
- Ah, I love online gaming culture.

6226
04:17:53,190 --> 04:17:55,140
I have to ask it 'cause it's kind of like one of

6227
04:17:55,140 --> 04:17:57,570
the legendary games is "Grand Theft Auto,"

6228
04:17:57,570 --> 04:18:01,080
speaking of the worlds that are just like...

6229
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:03,570
I mean that's a whole, it's that's its own thing, right?

6230
04:18:03,570 --> 04:18:06,600
That's that world, the characters,

6231
04:18:06,600 --> 04:18:09,360
the style, the edginess, all of that.

6232
04:18:09,360 --> 04:18:12,810
But the interesting thing about "Grand Theft Auto 6" to me

6233
04:18:12,810 --> 04:18:15,120
that I want to ask you about is they took forever.

6234
04:18:15,120 --> 04:18:17,850
It's the six month thing that you mentioned before.

6235
04:18:17,850 --> 04:18:20,800
You know, there's some games like that just take years

6236
04:18:21,720 --> 04:18:23,493
to bring to the conclusion.

6237
04:18:24,690 --> 04:18:29,400
What can you say about that process that, you know,

6238
04:18:29,400 --> 04:18:34,200
you eventually were able to take Unreal to completion.

6239
04:18:34,200 --> 04:18:37,200
If you were to look from the outside,

6240
04:18:37,200 --> 04:18:39,660
why does it take Grand Theft Auto that long

6241
04:18:39,660 --> 04:18:43,590
or other companies

6242
04:18:43,590 --> 04:18:46,170
to take the games to the conclusion

6243
04:18:46,170 --> 04:18:51,170
and I mean, just insight into what that process is like.

6244
04:18:52,140 --> 04:18:53,610
- Making games is very hard

6245
04:18:53,610 --> 04:18:55,140
and especially when you're pushing

6246
04:18:55,140 --> 04:18:56,540
the boundaries of something.

6247
04:18:58,050 --> 04:18:59,760
You know, with "Grand Theft Auto,"

6248
04:18:59,760 --> 04:19:01,380
it's just the realism

6249
04:19:01,380 --> 04:19:03,960
and feeling that you're in this huge city

6250
04:19:03,960 --> 04:19:06,540
and anything can happen and it's all living

6251
04:19:06,540 --> 04:19:09,150
and breathing in you're just a part of it.

6252
04:19:09,150 --> 04:19:11,550
The level with which Rockstar has brought quality

6253
04:19:11,550 --> 04:19:13,410
to that genre is astonishing.

6254
04:19:13,410 --> 04:19:16,020
And when you're building something at a level of quality

6255
04:19:16,020 --> 04:19:18,690
and detail that's never been achieved before,

6256
04:19:18,690 --> 04:19:20,690
you can't predict how long it will take.

6257
04:19:21,570 --> 04:19:25,350
Whatever problems you're solving today to get to, you know,

6258
04:19:25,350 --> 04:19:26,970
the next iteration of quality on it,

6259
04:19:26,970 --> 04:19:29,730
you don't know what new problems that will unlock.

6260
04:19:29,730 --> 04:19:32,132
And often, you know, you fix one thing

6261
04:19:32,132 --> 04:19:33,150
and make it super realistic

6262
04:19:33,150 --> 04:19:35,395
and that just highlights the unrealism of other things

6263
04:19:35,395 --> 04:19:36,695
that you then need to fix.

6264
04:19:37,560 --> 04:19:39,030
And I think the, you know, the thing that always

6265
04:19:39,030 --> 04:19:43,200
comes to mind is that shipping a game is easy

6266
04:19:43,200 --> 04:19:45,693
if you don't have a high quality standard,

6267
04:19:46,590 --> 04:19:48,510
we also won't have much success.

6268
04:19:48,510 --> 04:19:51,330
What we've seen from Rockstar is they take a long time,

6269
04:19:51,330 --> 04:19:54,390
but they ship amazing games and it's worth it in the end.

6270
04:19:54,390 --> 04:19:57,270
Right, a bad game is bad forever.

6271
04:19:57,270 --> 04:19:59,460
The late good game is eventually game is released

6272
04:19:59,460 --> 04:20:01,110
and is good.

6273
04:20:01,110 --> 04:20:04,260
- Do you ever feel, like Rockstar is a good example of that,

6274
04:20:04,260 --> 04:20:07,533
the pressure of delivering quality.

6275
04:20:08,400 --> 04:20:11,310
You know, Epic has not missed recently

6276
04:20:11,310 --> 04:20:14,360
that I'm aware of in terms of delivering quality.

6277
04:20:14,360 --> 04:20:16,473
Do you feel the pressure of that,

6278
04:20:16,473 --> 04:20:19,260
that you're not allowed misses?

6279
04:20:19,260 --> 04:20:20,313
- We certainly do.

6280
04:20:22,770 --> 04:20:25,110
Everybody's often working very much to the last minute

6281
04:20:25,110 --> 04:20:26,700
to make something excellent.

6282
04:20:26,700 --> 04:20:30,090
And it's really hard with these fast delivery timeframes

6283
04:20:30,090 --> 04:20:33,600
because you really have to get a lot of stuff up and running

6284
04:20:33,600 --> 04:20:34,560
before you can judge it,

6285
04:20:34,560 --> 04:20:36,660
like a new "Fortnite" season holistically.

6286
04:20:37,530 --> 04:20:40,110
You know, it's not until like the last month or so

6287
04:20:40,110 --> 04:20:41,693
that you really know what you've built

6288
04:20:41,693 --> 04:20:43,260
and you really understand it.

6289
04:20:43,260 --> 04:20:46,530
And if any late breaking problems emerge in like balance

6290
04:20:46,530 --> 04:20:49,080
or anything else, it's usually towards the end

6291
04:20:49,080 --> 04:20:52,800
and that usually leads to a rapid push to fix it.

6292
04:20:52,800 --> 04:20:55,150
And then other lessons you can only learn live.

6293
04:20:56,310 --> 04:20:58,020
And you know, from experience

6294
04:20:58,020 --> 04:21:01,890
and that means accepting a game that like

6295
04:21:01,890 --> 04:21:04,290
it's a live experience and it's also an experiment

6296
04:21:04,290 --> 04:21:06,060
and it's gonna continually be improving.

6297
04:21:06,060 --> 04:21:08,997
And anytime there's some things that some people don't like

6298
04:21:08,997 --> 04:21:12,600
and you learn from it and you improve it and you move on.

6299
04:21:12,600 --> 04:21:14,760
- Let me ask you a big philosophical question.

6300
04:21:14,760 --> 04:21:17,860
So you've created these gigantic worlds

6301
04:21:18,720 --> 04:21:22,293
that bring so much fun to humanity,

6302
04:21:23,160 --> 04:21:25,470
but you also get to learn about humanity.

6303
04:21:25,470 --> 04:21:28,893
What gives you hope about us humans,

6304
04:21:29,820 --> 04:21:33,423
about the future of humans, the future of humanity?

6305
04:21:34,470 --> 04:21:37,770
- You know, I see two contrasting worlds that, you know,

6306
04:21:37,770 --> 04:21:39,570
have been brought about in the digital age.

6307
04:21:39,570 --> 04:21:41,760
One is the world of social networks

6308
04:21:41,760 --> 04:21:43,050
and people typing at each other

6309
04:21:43,050 --> 04:21:47,280
and just, you know, massive negativity and politics

6310
04:21:47,280 --> 04:21:50,596
and, you know, hucksterism

6311
04:21:50,596 --> 04:21:55,200
and, you know, curation by engagement

6312
04:21:55,200 --> 04:21:59,133
often promoting negativity and toxicity.

6313
04:22:00,090 --> 04:22:01,680
That's a harsh world, I think is a step

6314
04:22:01,680 --> 04:22:02,790
backwards in many ways.

6315
04:22:02,790 --> 04:22:04,920
Like, I think that the foundation of the world

6316
04:22:04,920 --> 04:22:06,090
is actually a little bit shaky

6317
04:22:06,090 --> 04:22:08,640
because of just the social dynamic

6318
04:22:08,640 --> 04:22:11,310
that those platforms have have brought on.

6319
04:22:11,310 --> 04:22:14,631
But then I compare that with the good spiritedness

6320
04:22:14,631 --> 04:22:15,960
of what's happening online when you're connected

6321
04:22:15,960 --> 04:22:18,030
to real people, like actually playing "Fortnite."

6322
04:22:18,030 --> 04:22:19,470
Playing "Fortnite," full squads with people

6323
04:22:19,470 --> 04:22:21,060
you've never met before, never talked to,

6324
04:22:21,060 --> 04:22:23,250
and just judging what, you know,

6325
04:22:23,250 --> 04:22:24,600
human connections develop there

6326
04:22:24,600 --> 04:22:25,680
and whether they're positive.

6327
04:22:25,680 --> 04:22:29,130
I found those to be really, really excellent and endearing.

6328
04:22:29,130 --> 04:22:33,060
I think the lesson from all of that is that humans talking

6329
04:22:33,060 --> 04:22:38,060
to humans and being together in the real world

6330
04:22:38,190 --> 04:22:40,590
or virtual world is

6331
04:22:40,590 --> 04:22:43,860
a naturally empathetic medium at which naturally leads

6332
04:22:43,860 --> 04:22:46,320
to bonding and though conflict sometimes occurs,

6333
04:22:46,320 --> 04:22:48,930
it's just generally so much more promoting

6334
04:22:48,930 --> 04:22:50,010
of our social norms

6335
04:22:50,010 --> 04:22:52,380
and good interactions between people

6336
04:22:52,380 --> 04:22:54,270
and positivity promoting.

6337
04:22:54,270 --> 04:22:56,220
Whereas kind of the, you know,

6338
04:22:56,220 --> 04:22:58,590
typing angry message is thing at each other

6339
04:22:58,590 --> 04:23:02,940
as a self-reinforcing negative dynamic that's negative.

6340
04:23:02,940 --> 04:23:06,330
And then I think you though, you look at social media

6341
04:23:06,330 --> 04:23:08,730
and you look at gaming that is increasingly social

6342
04:23:08,730 --> 04:23:11,520
and I couldn't see a bigger divide between any two medium

6343
04:23:11,520 --> 04:23:14,670
as I see there in terms of the actual social dynamics.

6344
04:23:14,670 --> 04:23:18,870
One super positive, one super toxic at times.

6345
04:23:18,870 --> 04:23:23,280
- Yeah, that's actually really the text-based medium.

6346
04:23:23,280 --> 04:23:24,960
Now that could even be around gaming.

6347
04:23:24,960 --> 04:23:28,560
You could look at Discord, it could be a real toxic in text,

6348
04:23:28,560 --> 04:23:30,900
but you place humans together

6349
04:23:30,900 --> 04:23:32,640
in the real world, here in the room.

6350
04:23:32,640 --> 04:23:34,320
I literally have never, like,

6351
04:23:34,320 --> 04:23:37,560
I very rarely see humans not get along

6352
04:23:37,560 --> 04:23:39,153
in the physical space.

6353
04:23:40,020 --> 04:23:44,250
And the degree to which you can create a digital space,

6354
04:23:44,250 --> 04:23:46,500
like a metaverse type of space

6355
04:23:46,500 --> 04:23:48,900
where it's sufficiently immersive,

6356
04:23:48,900 --> 04:23:53,900
where you feel the other person, the empathy comes out

6357
04:23:53,970 --> 04:23:57,300
and then the joy that's derived from the empathy comes out.

6358
04:23:57,300 --> 04:24:00,153
And it's just a reminder that humans like,

6359
04:24:01,200 --> 04:24:03,030
I don't know that humans are good

6360
04:24:03,030 --> 04:24:04,800
and they wanna see the good in others,

6361
04:24:04,800 --> 04:24:06,870
they wanna share the goodness.

6362
04:24:06,870 --> 04:24:08,970
And then, you know, like when they get in

6363
04:24:08,970 --> 04:24:12,510
that group together, there's love there.

6364
04:24:12,510 --> 04:24:16,470
Now they might talk shit about some other group,

6365
04:24:16,470 --> 04:24:19,050
this is the dark side of humans, (laughs)

6366
04:24:19,050 --> 04:24:21,330
but together in terms of the dynamics

6367
04:24:21,330 --> 04:24:23,220
of that group, is joyful.

6368
04:24:23,220 --> 04:24:25,497
So yeah, that gives me hope as well.

6369
04:24:25,497 --> 04:24:29,190
And the more degree which we can create those worlds

6370
04:24:29,190 --> 04:24:31,740
online that make it super easy for us to connect

6371
04:24:31,740 --> 04:24:34,200
in that empathic way, the better.

6372
04:24:34,200 --> 04:24:38,550
And I am grateful that you are pushing the boundaries

6373
04:24:38,550 --> 04:24:41,010
of what's possible in creating such worlds.

6374
04:24:41,010 --> 04:24:43,380
And I'm grateful that you would talk with me today, Tim.

6375
04:24:43,380 --> 04:24:46,350
This was amazing and it's an honor to talk to you.

6376
04:24:46,350 --> 04:24:49,230
- Oh, thank you very much, it's been fun.

6377
04:24:49,230 --> 04:24:50,580
- Thanks for listening to this conversation

6378
04:24:50,580 --> 04:24:51,660

6379

And now let me leave you some words from Benjamin Franklin.

6382
04:25:00,037 --> 04:25:03,900
"We do not stop playing because we grow old,

6383
04:25:03,900 --> 04:25:06,627
we grow old because we stop playing."

6384

Thank you for listening, I hope to see you next time.
