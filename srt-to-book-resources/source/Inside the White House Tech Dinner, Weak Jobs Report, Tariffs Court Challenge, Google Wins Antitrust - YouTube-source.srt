5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,839
 ah, so you suited up with the ties.

6
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,639
 you suited up with ties.

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:09,440
 well, maybe i'll join you.

8
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,320

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,599
 oh, look.

10
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,480

12
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,759
 oh, that's for my guy tom.

16
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,520
 oh, what's going on here?

17
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,720
 tom ford sent you something.

18
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,320
 oh, tom sent me a nice tie.

19
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,480
 and you don't go i i heard that moose ate your invitation to the white house.

20
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,960
 he did.

21
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,760
 he did.

22
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,040
 sorry about that.

23
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,440
 sorry about that.

24
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
 [music] let your winners ride.

25
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,559
 rainman david.

26
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,760
 we open sources to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,199
 all right, everybody.

28
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,120
 welcome back to the number one podcast in the universe in the universe.

29
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,199
 it's been proven time and time again.

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
 oh, this i'm not putting the tie up.

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,479
 ah, it.

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,600
 it's just it's enough already.

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
 i i guess friday.

34
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,720
 we we moved the show to friday.

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,000
 sorry you're getting this on saturday.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
 you can't come to the white house.

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,360
 you can't figure out a tie.

38
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,680
 yeah.

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
 well, maybe you could show me how to do this next time i'm in town.

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,600
 i got to practice with you.

41
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,479
 we'll go in the mirror.

42
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:18,880
 you could.

43
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,439
 that'd be great.

44
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,479
 bit you behind me.

45
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,240
 show me how to do a tie.

46
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,439
 we didn't have ties in brooklyn.

47
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,320
 what do you want me to do?

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,640
 all right.

49
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,280
 well, it was an eventful week.

50
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
 some of our besties,

51
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,560
 some,

52
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,880
 not all, were invited apparently to a a little suare

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,759
 at the white house with the president,

54
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,720
 saxs and cham.

55
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
 here's a photo.

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,520
 some pretty good seeing arrangement here.

57
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,000
 looks like zuckerberg got the pole position on the right hand of the father

58
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,840
 followed by saxi pooh and chimath and amo

59
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,799
 sitting right across from sam alman and tim cook.

60
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,600
 what a crowd.

61
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,720
 what a crowd.

62
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,520
 what was the

63
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,320
 um what was the impetus for this dinner?

64
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
 sachs, tell us.

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
 well, this was a tech dinner at the white house.

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
 i think it originally started with a group

67
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,560
 that chimath

68
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,520
 organized in silicon

69
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
 valley and they were kind of the core nucleus

70
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,720
 of this and then

71
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,319
 more and more people just wanted to

72
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,239
 come and try to get in and

73
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,280
 the president invited some of the top tech leaders and

74
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,920
 pretty soon it turned into the room that you saw there.

75
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,720
 i mean it's really pretty amazing president trump's ability to convene all these people.

76
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,599
 you normally don't get these people in a room together.

77
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
 many of them are competitors and it's remarkable.

78
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,400
 you pretty much had i'd say like maybe half the tech industry was there

79
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,280
 by market cap.

80
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,680
 certainly.

81
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
 by market cap for sure.

82
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,920
 yeah.

83
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,120
 and chimath, you obviously were involved here and you got a pretty good seat.

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
 any great inside stories?

85
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
 any inside baseball?

86
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,959
 what did they serve?

87
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,599
 by the way, i'm curious what gets served at a dinner like this.

88
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,560
 that was a very elegant menu.

89
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
 and they they try to keep it light so that it's not

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,519
 overwhelming, which i think can get in the way.

91
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,040
 so it was like so no prime rib, right?

92
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,920
 there was a barata

93
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
 salad and then there was a a fillet and then a nice raspberry

94
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,000
 dessert.

95
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,440
 okay, here's what i'll tell you.

96
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,400
 sax said it well.

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,599
 what was incredible for me just to frankly be in the room felt very surreal.

98
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,319
 you're seeing the leaders of the most important companies in the world sitting together

99
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,080
 and i just felt like there was a sense of alignment and cooperation

100
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,599
 and that was really cool.

101
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,280
 i think none of those folks

102
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
 have to really show up anywhere that they don't have to.

103
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
 i think they're at a place in their career and the importance

104
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,400
 of the businesses

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,959
 that they run.

106
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,680
 but the fact that the president can convene them, i think says

107
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
 a lot about him and the agenda.

108
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
 and then they

109
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,239
 to a one were incredibly

110
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,720
 supportive of what he has done and

111
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,879
 clearing the way and allowing them to build their businesses with a lot more clarity.

112
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,720
 it was just very clear the juxtaposition

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,440
 of

114
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,560
 what it was like and the difficulty under biden versus what it was now.

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,200
 and you saw some very truly hard cast liberals who have now completely embraced president trump.

116
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,120
 folks like tim cook, folks like bill gates.

117
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,760
 and i think that that's an incredible testament to him and his agenda.

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,439
 and then the second thing, which is more personal, is i was so proud of sachs.

119
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,320
 every single one of these guys, and you're talking like the titans of titans,

120
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,358
 they took a moment to say that he was just doing an incredible

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,199
 job and the president was really proud of it.

122
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,160
 it was like as a brother.

123
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
 it's like you're seeing your brother just get completely it was it was great.

124
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,880
 so, that was really special.

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
 freeberg, any any take on this?

126
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
 i i noticed you didn't make it.

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,280
 you didn't make the cut.

128
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,840
 my invite got eaten by moose obviously as we heard earlier, but

129
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,759
 i thought you for sure would get a seat.

130
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,560
 what happened for you?

131
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,360
 bring no seat for you.

132
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,960
 i work in agriculture, jay cal.

133
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,639
 so, we're doing the agriculture dinner next month.

134
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,280
 it's going to be great.

135
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
 the president and i are arranging a round table.

136
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,600
 it's going to be fantastic.

137
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,880
 yeah, just kidding.

138
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,759
 no, but i was in dc.

139
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
 so, if i eat my vegetables, i can come to them.

140
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,680
 no, no, i was in dc with the guys.

141
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
 i actually did an interview with

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,440
 senator

143
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,759
 rand

144
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,080
 paul,

145
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,560
 which you'll

146
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
 which i think is out on youtube

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,080
 now

148
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,400
 and

149
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,520
 on our

150
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
 podcast channels.

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
 it was great to sit down with the senator.

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
 what was the highlight of the of the the paul interview?

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
 i didn't get to watch it yet.

154
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,199
 apologies.

155
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,479
 as i was getting ready for the summit.

156
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,880
 but did you have a highlight or two you want to share with us?

157
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
 i mean he he's an interesting guy.

158
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,680
 a lot of people have challenged him because he's an independent thinker.

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,759
 he really is true kind of libertarian

160
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,720
 views and libertarian beliefs and he's held firm to them despite bucking with the party

161
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
 which he did recently on the big beautiful bill.

162
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
 you know he was one of three republicans to vote against it.

163
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,199
 so he's criticized and chastised and, you know, ousted

164
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,880
 in a lot of different circles in dc because he doesn't kind of fall in line.

165
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,199
 but i do think that dissent

166
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,120
 and debate is critical and important for us to find the better path forward.

167
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,800
 and i i like the role that he plays.

168
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
 and i think he's very first principled.

169
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
 and i think his talking about his ability to get elected

170
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,800
 despite not being willing to always fall in line with the party

171
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,320
 is a really important point.

172
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,639
 and he hopes it will inspire other politicians

173
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,080
 to follow the same path and for voters to see that there is a role

174
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,479
 for independent thinkers in congress.

175
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,720
 yeah, i mean that is something we need.

176
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,039
 it seems like these parties just get locked step.

177
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,639
 they're expected to vote the same.

178
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,680
 they're vote on party lines and

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,600
 sachs that is definitely a weakness i think of the two-party system.

180
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,199
 your thoughts on ran paul and his

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,400
 you know being a bit of an agitator maybe like

182
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
 mansion was that there's a role for this.

183
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:32,639
 yeah.

184
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,319
 in our democracy.

185
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,400
 well, i think it's good to hear from a libertarian

186
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,759
 voice once in a while they're going to have a different sort of conservative

187
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,560
 once in a while.

188
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,080
 i caught that too.

189
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,840
 they're going to have a different sort of viewpoint that could be called conservative.

190
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,360
 so, i like grandp.

191
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
 but can we just go back to the the dinner?

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,840
 i want to just yeah build on a point that chimath

193
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,720
 made about the level of sort of comey

194
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,240
 in in the room.

195
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,479
 i think that the the people in the room there it was remarkable even though

196
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,199
 a lot of these companies are competing with each other they

197
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,840
 were largely on the same page with respect to what was happening

198
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,800
 in the economy

199
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,440
 and the world

200
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,919
 and

201
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,520
 with the kind of support they needed

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,919
 for

203
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,720
 the tech industry

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,440
 to do well

205
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:13,759
 and

206
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,720
 for the us economy

207
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,919
 to do well.

208
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,240
 and i think the reason why they were largely happy with the trump administration

209
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,440
 is because the trump administration has been pro- innovation, pro- infrastructure,

210
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,880
 which includes being pro- energy, pro- export, so these companies can sell their products internationally.

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,800
 and then also the thing that's been very important to the trump administration is proworker.

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,639
 and you heard the president make all of those points in his

213
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
 critical ai speech

214
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
 that he gave on july 23rd at the ai summit that we co-sponsored

215
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
 with hill and valley.

216
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,000
 so i think a lot of the compliments that we received were due to the agenda

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,599
 that the president articulated

218
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
 so well at the ai

219
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,199
 summit

220
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,599
 and

221
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,879
 the people in that room are largely

222
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,199
 supportive

223
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,639
 of that policy.

224
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:58,960
 so,

225
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,479
 i don't know if i would call it a love fest,

226
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,759
 but i think it was an opportunity

227
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,960
 for

228
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,759
 these tech leaders to articulate their concerns where they could use help.

229
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,759
 and i think the president, he's a great listener, and

230
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,000
 he wanted to take in their feedback and

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,479
 figure out how to make the economy grow even faster.

232
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,240
 i had so many questions from, you know, behind the scenes, etc., like

233
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
 seating arrangement, how's that discussed?

234
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,639
 the first thing i'll say is the president takes tremendous control over these details.

235
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,199
 so i've said this before about how conscientious

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
 he is, but one of the things that he noticed before

237
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,640
 was it was very difficult to host

238
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,000
 press conferences or world leaders outside in the rose garden.

239
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,039
 so the way that it started was around 4:00

240
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,480
 what happened was that

241
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,200
 david, and i'll tell you because there was a joke about this at dinner.

242
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,600
 david asked the president, "can we do a tour of the oval

243
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,720
 for all of the fans of allin?" and the president said, "absolutely." so me, freeberg,

244
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,000
 sachs, we went and caroline levit meets us and walks us in.

245
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,040
 by the way, if you want to see a star of stars,

246
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,040
 like i've i've met few people like this who exudes this level of competence.

247
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,959
 i mean, i think it was the first thing that freeberg

248
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,600
 said after maybe like two minutes of interacting with her.

249
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,120
 it's like, "wow, this may be the most competent person i've ever spoken to.

250
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
 she's outrageously

251
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,800
 good."

252
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,360
 so,

253
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,240
 she gets us all,

254
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:26,720
 she cleans

255
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,640
 up some stuff that had to be cleaned up,

256
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:28,959
 walks

257
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,240
 us in,

258
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,320
 and the president gave us this tour.

259
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
 and the beautiful thing about the tour, if you are

260
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,320
 a student of american history, is the history is on the walls.

261
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,959
 i mean from george washington to abe lincoln to even ben franklin

262
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,800
 and the declaration of independence jason.

263
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,360
 and so

264
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
 we were able to see all of that and and

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
 see all of that in detail and he was able to talk about it and then

266
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,839
 as it kind of always does it veers where

267
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,000
 you know he does the weave and he's like guys

268
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,920
 what do we want to talk about and

269
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,480
 free

270
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,080
 was able to ask some questions and saxs

271
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,880
 and i and then it just became a little bit more freewheeling

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
 like well it turned into like a hang a hang.

273
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:07,600
 yeah.

274
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
 we we hung with the president

275
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,760
 and then

276
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,200
 after we hung we turned the cameras

277
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,600
 off

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
 and then we hung like another half hour 45

279
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,480
 minutes with him.

280
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,120
 people are coming in the oval

281
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
 but it's literally like an episode of west wing

282
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,160
 meets vep meets like you know it was like everyone's just chatting going in and out.

283
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
 you meet all the characters.

284
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,240
 so then that

285
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,720
 ends

286
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
 and sax had to do some meetings in the oval with the president.

287
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,959
 so we all leave and we're escorted into i think it's the roosevelt room.

288
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,600
 sax, is that right?

289
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,720
 is that so when we get into the roosevelt room, this is where it becomes surreal.

290
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,839
 you're seeing the most powerful people that have built these incredible businesses.

291
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,600
 i think there's 30 people, but the table can only fit like 15 people.

292
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
 and so you have like

293
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
 tim and sam and satia

294
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,079
 sitting on the couch over here by these two chairs just like dylan

295
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,360
 field and alan

296
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,240
 wag.

297
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,160
 and it's like the funniest scene because everybody

298
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,440
 at that moment

299
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,079
 all the ears are gone because they know the context in which they're they're there.

300
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:10,240
 yeah.

301
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,399
 in their own worlds, they're like kings.

302
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,680
 but in the white house, you're back.

303
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,880
 you're sharing the backbench.

304
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,920
 you're an american citizen who's there to meet the president, right?

305
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,760
 but there were some incredible people there.

306
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,519
 some people i i'd not really met before.

307
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
 safatz, lovely, and her husband.

308
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,279
 and then there were some other people that were just amazing.

309
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,240
 jared isaacman, which is wonderful to see him.

310
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,680
 there was a whole group of folks that were there.

311
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,240
 and then

312
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,240
 they say, "hey guys, can you just get into a single file line?"

313
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,399
 and so again, it's like a it's like a surreal scene where it's like

314
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,560
 sundar satya, bill gates, survey

315
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,240
 these people in a single file line.

316
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,839
 i mean, you guys sound like you went backstage at a zeppelin concert.

317
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,399
 incredible.

318
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:56,640
 no, dude.

319
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,640
 and then we're we're escorted into the oval

320
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,800
 and this is like what's so kind about what he does.

321
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,760
 he sits at the at the resolute desk

322
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,480
 and mirith or who's incredible,

323
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,720
 she introduces everybody one by one so that they hear their name.

324
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,920
 i don't i it may sound like a a weird thing, jason, but like

325
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
 to hear your name called

326
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,760
 in the oval and then you stand beside the president.

327
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,560
 he's seated and they have a photo.

328
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
 they take this beautiful photo

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,360
 and then the first person was saffra and her husband and her husband

330
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
 says, "could i take a pen?" i swear.

331
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,279
 so

332
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:39,920
 the president

333
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,839
 says, "of course, that's what they're there for."

334
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,680
 so he gives him a challenge coin

335
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,320
 and a pen.

336
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,079
 everybody takes one.

337
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,680
 so again, you're seeing the leaders of these incredible businesses.

338
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
 one by one, they get announced.

339
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,800
 they go stand by the president.

340
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,519
 they take a beautiful picture and they take a coin and a pen.

341
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,959
 and then we're all just kind of milling in the oval after that's all done.

342
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
 and he says, "well, guys, we're going to talk at dinner, but

343
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
 do you want to just start?"

344
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,680
 and it was amazing because sergey, does he sit behind the desk then?

345
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
 he's still sitting at the he's still sitting.

346
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,279
 so anyways, sergey asks a few questions,

347
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,639
 really starts to get the conversation going, which i which i think was really good.

348
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,760
 and then he says, "okay guys, let's continue this conversation

349
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,519
 at dinner." and so we exit into the rose garden

350
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,160
 and this is where our friend

351
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,040
 sunonny madro

352
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,519
 says

353
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,040
 on the way like as we're walking says sir i hear you have a playlist.

354
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,079
 can we hear the music?

355
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,839
 and so he takes the ipad

356
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,360
 turns the music on

357
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,480
 and he apparently

358
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
 had been tuning it and so now it's like

359
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,079
 he's got a great playlist by the way.

360
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,040
 it's like fleetwood mac.

361
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,680
 i mean like you're hearing like all the classics and it's just blasting in the rose.

362
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,639
 i mean blasting.

363
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,639
 lisa sue posted one of the photos.

364
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,040
 you can see them all because like the oval is small.

365
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,279
 okay.

366
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,079
 so, just to be clear.

367
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,519
 so, then that's dinner.

368
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,000
 oh, wow.

369
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,399
 there you go.

370
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,600
 it's stuffed.

371
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,720
 i mean, i'm

372
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,320
 right to the left of tim and jamie simmonoff is right at the end.

373
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,920
 i and i think it's vc rana dbe who's the owner of the kings

374
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
 is right there of the sacramento kings started typical and then i think it's me.

375
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,680
 i think i was standing kind of more in the front there.

376
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
 anyways, so we leave.

377
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,199
 so, so if you just pause there.

378
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,480
 so that window

379
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,279
 that's sham sankar who's the cto of palanteer

380
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,680
 and behind him is dave limp and then you can see

381
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,920
 dylan field the founder and ceo of figma.

382
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
 that's the door you exit.

383
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,480
 you go into the rose garden and then you walk through and

384
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,680
 we walk down the hallway.

385
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,720
 you guys have seen that before.

386
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,880
 and we go into the to the east wing and they say

387
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,519
 want to introduce the first lady.

388
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,480
 so what happens is you walk into the east wing, you walk upstairs

389
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,399
 and there's a very elegant seating chart that they make.

390
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
 it's actually a really good way of doing it because normally

391
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
 what you would do is you would

392
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,680
 walk around the table.

393
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,160
 yeah.

394
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,079
 no, this is a much better system.

395
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,160
 so you actually have a

396
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,000
 small model of the table

397
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 and so what happens is you go you you can see where everybody is sitting

398
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
 and then you see where you're sitting and then there's an escort that takes you to

399
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,040
 your seat.

400
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,760
 so, it's a really it's it's done really well.

401
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,800
 i mean, for it's very thoughtful.

402
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,760
 yeah, it's very thoughtful.

403
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,519
 it was in the east room where we also

404
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,320
 did the crypto

405
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,639
 summit

406
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,079
 at the white house and there's been

407
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,639
 other events

408
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:16,959
 there.

409
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:19,680
 but let me just give a shout out to the first lady, melania trump.

410
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,160
 she's very interested in this topic of ai.

411
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,480
 and in fact, earlier that day, we did an event at the white house

412
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,160
 with the ai education task force, which she's chairing.

413
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,440
 and she's very passionate about making sure that every school child in america has access

414
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
 to ai

415
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
 so they can get ai education.

416
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,639
 and we had dozens of companies there at the white house making pledges

417
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,279
 of resources to make sure that

418
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,279
 teachers and students and families will be able to have everything they need

419
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,320
 for kids to learn ai so they have the skills

420
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
 for this critical tool.

421
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,079
 so this is a topic she's very interested in.

422
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,000
 so she wanted to be at that dinner.

423
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
 so then we get seated

424
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,399
 and

425
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:00,720
 people

426
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
 are talking a little bit and he goes, "guys,

427
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,600
 if it's okay with you, we're just going to let the press in." and i thought

428
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,959
 what that meant was

429
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,199
 a few people, i mean,

430
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,920
 i've never seen anything like this before.

431
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:19,120
 it it's like a zoo entered the east wing like cameras, boom, microphones.

432
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,079
 oh, the gaggle.

433
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,040
 the gaggle.

434
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,199
 they start screaming

435
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,199
 because like everybody's trying to shout over each other to try to

436
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,399
 be able to ask questions.

437
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,440
 but then, you know, the president kind of imposes control and says, "guys,

438
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,600
 hold on." and then he allowed

439
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,839
 the ceos of the of the big companies

440
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,600
 to say something and then gates said something

441
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
 and then that kind of set the tone and obviously he said something

442
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,720
 and then he said, "anybody have any questions?" and then they just start screaming.

443
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,920
 i mean, and there are people running around with mics.

444
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
 i don't know

445
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,360
 how you pick who gets to say something quite honestly because the question

446
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,320
 procedure it's out of control.

447
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,480
 no, but but you know what's crazy is the questions are so all over the place.

448
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,279
 i don't know how you can be prepared like he knows what he's saying.

449
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,640
 he's very purposeful with what he's saying.

450
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,240
 i don't know how you do that

451
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,559
 because

452
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,119
 the questions

453
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,000
 are all over the place and you could tell like cuz one of them asked zuck

454
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,799
 questions.

455
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,720
 zuck was like what's going on zuck?

456
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,799
 zuck zuck what about your 12 houses in palo alto zuck?

457
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,880
 i mean, no, it was a tougher question.

458
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,439
 what was that?

459
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,280
 i it was about free speech and the uk and he did a pretty good job.

460
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,039
 zach, my instagram account's locked.

461
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,839
 can you help me?

462
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,640
 my instagram.

463
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,039
 anyway,

464
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,400
 so then so then they leave

465
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,039
 and then

466
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,880
 well, by the way, they have to be like thrown

467
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,200
 out,

468
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,440
 you know.

469
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,480
 they don't just leave.

470
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,039
 they're out of control.

471
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,039
 they make coral, you know.

472
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,440
 yeah.

473
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,720
 and then we had this

474
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
 lovely three course dinner and then right after the appetizer,

475
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,840
 i think like he starts going around and people just start

476
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,160
 talking and saying things and things that are on their mind.

477
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,400
 and i'm i'm not going to share anything from that from that.

478
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,679
 but i thought i thought that was pretty illuminating and pretty awesome.

479
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,440
 let me ask you a candid question.

480
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
 and challenge him on any topics.

481
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
 were there any i mean we saw there's a lot of agilation.

482
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:56,880
 people thank you mr.

483
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,440
 president.

484
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,480
 there's a lot of difference.

485
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
 anybody throw him a fastball, curveball?

486
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
 was there any challenging question in that format?

487
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
 it's not about asking him questions like you're interviewing him.

488
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,600
 but there are people that brought up challenging things that they are dealing with.

489
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,640
 yeah, that's what i mean.

490
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
 but that no, that is not what you said.

491
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,960
 so, no, no, it's something that maybe is

492
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
 not aligned with maybe how the administration is doing things.

493
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
 that's what i'm sort of getting at.

494
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,240
 okay.

495
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,120
 no, but that's again you're trying to like nobody's there to gotcha.

496
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,880
 people are like, "sir, i'm dealing with this specific issue in this specific country.

497
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
 can you help?" ah, got it.

498
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,640
 well, i was thinking like immigration, high skilled in immigration.

499
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
 that seems like a topic everybody cares about in our industry.

500
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,080
 i'll tell you what we talked about.

501
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,799
 the issues that they had are

502
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:45,600
 many and they have to deal with how american companies can build businesses

503
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,120
 in a seamless, straightforward way.

504
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,600
 and what they said is

505
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,200
 since biden, what trump has done is clean the decks and allowed them.

506
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,080
 they all said that.

507
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,520
 they didn't they weren't forced to say that.

508
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,280
 they all said it, which i thought was really cool.

509
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,000
 this is again why i said earlier, super proud of what david has done.

510
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,400
 like it was palpable the respect that all these guys had for him, which is awesome.

511
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
 but then what the president says is, i could take care of this.

512
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,640
 i can do that.

513
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
 that's not going to stand.

514
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,640
 he's like what you see is you have these american titans of industry.

515
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
 i've said this before, jason.

516
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,000
 the whole premise of the american dream, i think, rests on economic and military supremacy.

517
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,200
 that is derived from technical supremacy.

518
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,840
 that group of people are the geniuses that create the technical supremacy for the world.

519
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
 and he is their biggest advocate.

520
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,720
 and that's inspiring because it's like

521
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
 they are like sir here's what we need

522
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,080
 and he's like great

523
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,799
 i'm going to go to that for you and try to get what you need.

524
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,840
 and so there was that conversation and then there was a joke

525
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,520
 and he said at the end something to along the lines of ah you know

526
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,480
 i had to

527
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
 it's a tough day or something like i had to

528
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,760
 i had to film a segment

529
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,160
 for

530
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,559
 david's

531
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:58,880
 dumb

532
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,280
 podcast.

533
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,640
 just said it like as a joke.

534
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,360
 so everybody everybody everybody starts laughing and then zuck piles on.

535
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,160
 he goes, "well, the only dumb parts are chimat's parts and

536
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,600
 everybody else starts laughing." but when zuck said it, he's leaning back.

537
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
 and then he loses his balance.

538
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,600
 sax saxs with the tism is just looking straight ahead at timco.

539
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,679
 i i am like i don't know what to do.

540
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:28,720
 nat caught zuck.

541
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,679
 nat pulls her arm.

542
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,799
 i don't know how she got there.

543
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,840
 it was a really sweet moment.

544
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
 and then i had a favorite moment actually.

545
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,080
 it occurred after you guys left the white house.

546
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:36,799
 here it is.

547
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,280
 this is chimat's greatest moment.

548
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,360
 there is a chimat super fan.

549
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,320
 as you can see there, that's a chimat super fan.

550
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,360
 and he's signing multiple pictures from all different eras.

551
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,720
 those will be on ebay later.

552
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:52,799
 look at this guy.

553
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,240
 i just want to back up and say

554
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,840
 one of the reasons why i thought it would be

555
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,679
 cool for us to kind of do this

556
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,480
 interview

557
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,360
 in the oval

558
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,320
 where the president

559
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,360
 kind of gave us a tour

560
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
 of the changes he had made to the white house

561
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,600
 is

562
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
 i was getting a tour

563
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,080
 with my family

564
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
 one weekend of the white house and the guides

565
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,400
 who do these tours

566
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
 were telling us about how much care the president takes in

567
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,559
 the condition of the white house and all the upgrades

568
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,919
 that he's made.

569
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
 and they've seen him walking around and he'll pick out paintings and art.

570
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,039
 they'll move things around.

571
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,679
 he got a whole bunch of paintings out of storage.

572
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,679
 all the paintings that are now in the oval office are ones that he directly

573
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:30,640
 picked out.

574
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,919
 and they also said that when he sees something wrong,

575
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,120
 like with the landscaping

576
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,080
 or, you know, he'll

577
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
 call a gardener over and give him notes on

578
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
 how to make it look better.

579
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,720
 and the president himself posted a truth

580
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,760
 a few days ago where the new pavers on the rose garden patio

581
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,480
 got damaged.

582
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,159
 there was like a big scratch and see that video.

583
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,440
 he caught them online.

584
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,919
 he caught the he caught he caught the delivery guys.

585
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,159
 he went to the tape to figure out who did it.

586
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:58,480
 yeah.

587
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,039
 yeah.

588
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,200
 that's that's a new york developer.

589
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,280
 and not only that, he fired them

590
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,840
 and he's making them pay for it and they got to buff it or something.

591
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,480
 yeah.

592
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,799
 it's funny.

593
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,120
 he told us the story at the dinner that the the contractor

594
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,240
 who got fired was devastated.

595
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,960
 so, he's probably going to have to hire them back cuz, you know, he's

596
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,760
 he's too nice.

597
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,799
 and he asked everybody.

598
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,440
 he's like, "do you guys think i should hire him back?" we're like, "yes,

599
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,799
 i heard the guy." he's like, "i'll probably hire him back." it started as a tour.

600
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,919
 it was supposed to be a tour.

601
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,960
 we were going to see the rose garden and other things.

602
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,240
 and then it rained

603
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,559
 and so we just stayed in the oval and then it became

604
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,039
 like

605
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,760
 more of like a hang.

606
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,159
 oh, wow.

607
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,840
 you guys are going to make that into an episode.

608
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,960
 that's going to be an episode.

609
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,159
 oh, that's incredible.

610
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:36,400
 okay.

611
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,799
 so, jason, like look, you see

612
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,760
 the couple days before and the president tweeted about this, nick.

613
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,720
 i sent that to you.

614
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,640
 you have india, russia and china kind of like fratinizing

615
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,280
 and then one or two days later

616
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,000
 the president convenes this dinner of

617
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,799
 i think you know some incredible entrepreneurs building

618
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,320
 a lot of the really important things that the world needs in the future.

619
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,280
 i don't know what your reaction is when you see the kind of like

620
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,919
 i mean yeah there's a legion of doom there the putin and she and

621
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,679
 not modi maybe but he he's obviously making a point

622
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,600
 but you know overall i had a lot of thoughts about it.

623
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,320
 but i did a i did a press hit.

624
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
 of the 20 people there or so, i'm not sure what the exact number was.

625
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,200
 i'm just eyeballing it here.

626
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,799
 i think we're at 2930. i think about 19 of them

627
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,840
 are lifelong democrats who have switched to this party.

628
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,640
 and and i i think the democrats need to look at this.

629
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,760
 this opportunity was always there for the democrats.

630
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,880
 but what did they choose?

631
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,679
 they chose to take the position of ban the billionaires

632
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,840
 and an agenda that makes no sense.

633
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,720
 and if you had invited this group of people, if you were biden

634
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,280
 or kamla

635
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:41,760
 and you invited

636
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,240
 this group of people to come to the white house, they would have come as well

637
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
 and you could have a really thoughtful

638
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,960
 conversation about them.

639
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,760
 what the democratic positions might be, you know, wages,

640
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,480
 healthcare,

641
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,039
 and and this same group of people would have engaged,

642
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,799
 but they were not allowed

643
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,159
 to access the white house.

644
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,480
 they were not allowed to have a dialogue.

645
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,320
 and i think they pursued, you know, very weird agenda.

646
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,559
 and you got nancy pelosi out there day trading.

647
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,799
 got aoc and the socialists, you know, pursuing some crazy agenda.

648
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,320
 what do you expect

649
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,799
 people to do if you tell them we don't want to hear your concerns?

650
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,159
 we don't want to engage with you in debate.

651
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,360
 you can have all kinds of differences with trump on style.

652
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,760
 i do.

653
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,279
 you could have policy issues.

654
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,240
 i do.

655
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
 but as a moderate,

656
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,440
 when i see something like this, i just got to give,

657
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
 you know, you a lot of credit,

658
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,240
 saxs,

659
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,520
 for being able to

660
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,000
 give

661
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,080
 access to the president and give the president

662
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
 access to these individuals

663
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,240
 and let

664
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
 an all these important discussions

665
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,559
 happen and then the group can act as one

666
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,000
 in the american people's interest.

667
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
 and i think it's very important for

668
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,320
 the democrats to learn something here, which is 90% of americans

669
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
 aspire to be billionaires.

670
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,960
 and 10% maybe they're you know socialists

671
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,679
 moon

672
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:56,320
 communists

673
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,000
 whatever they are it's fine they can pick

674
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,880
 and choose what

675
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,200
 they

676
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
 believe is important in the world

677
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,080
 but americans

678
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,520
 love these individuals

679
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,799
 they love these products and services and 70%

680
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,039
 of the top 50 companies in the world by market cap are american companies

681
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,880
 this is the best of america this is the best of the american dream

682
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,440
 and

683
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
 it's great that they can go and have debates

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,080
 with the president

685
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,200
 that was you know to my earlier

686
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,520
 question

687
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,919
 like i know a lot of these guys have some issues with the president

688
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,400
 or

689
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,200
 certain issues

690
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,840
 tariffs

691
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,880
 etc.

692
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,200
 this is an important i think moment in time to just say trump 2.0 i know

693
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,360
 is engaging the business community

694
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,640
 and meeting them where they are and saying how can i help you grow faster?

695
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,559
 how can we compete?

696
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,320
 america is not the only game in town.

697
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,159
 now, as you saw with modi,

698
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,279
 you know, creating this alliance with she and putin,

699
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,080
 it's imperative for the american companies to excel and create jobs.

700
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,440
 and we have the lowest unemployment.

701
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,559
 we'll talk about employment today.

702
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,919
 there's some new statistics.

703
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,080
 we have the lowest unemployment of our lifetimes.

704
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:58,960
 it's for a reason.

705
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,159
 it's not because of any president.

706
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,440
 it's because of these great companies.

707
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
 we should be celebrating them.

708
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,880
 and the president's done an exceptional job of doing what all americans do.

709
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,080
 we celebrate these companies.

710
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,039
 we love the iphone.

711
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,240
 we love teslas.

712
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,559
 we we love these products and services people are building.

713
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,279
 people love google.

714
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,320
 they love chat gbt.

715
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,600
 it's fantastic.

716
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,320
 and so it's easy to be cynical,

717
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,960
 you know, about business or business leaders,

718
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,159
 but this was really, i think, a great show of force

719
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,520
 and it shows the country's getting in sync on what matters and that

720
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,120
 has it should be independent

721
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,320
 of political parties.

722
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,720
 so i was very proud of you, david, that you built this bridge

723
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,760
 and you built it brick by brick and i think

724
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,159
 yet to come.

725
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,279
 well, i mean,

726
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,799
 just to be clear, i mean, obviously

727
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,520
 the president already

728
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,080
 had access

729
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,240
 to all these people and in fact, many of them

730
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,200
 were already on speed

731
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,240
 dial and he already knew

732
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,559
 them

733
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,000
 and he he's the one who convened

734
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,520
 them at the white house.

735
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,600
 i've just been helping with policy.

736
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,240
 so, i don't want to just be clear about that.

737
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
 well, i'm not overstating

738
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
 it, but i'm i'm i'm even going back six months

739
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
 when you guys held the fundraiser

740
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,600
 and then just, you know, you see like a very close friend of mine, mark pinkis,

741
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,520
 lifelong democrat, has donated,

742
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,159
 you know, probably

743
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:04,640
 eight figures

744
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,360
 to the dems

745
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,640
 in total over the years

746
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,679
 and he got frustrated

747
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,799
 at a certain point that he couldn't get his calls returned or he couldn't

748
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,840
 have important discussions.

749
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,640
 well, here we are.

750
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,000
 he was at that dinner.

751
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,480
 i think that's a very important lesson.

752
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,440
 the democrats need to feel moderates, business leaders.

753
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,480
 they got their bob igor,

754
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:20,960
 they got jamie

755
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,360
 diamond,

756
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,440
 they got a bunch of people who could help,

757
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,559
 you know, build an agenda that's not lunacy.

758
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:26,720
 yeah.

759
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,279
 and what i would say is is look, maybe half the people at the dinner

760
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,520
 have actually moved to the center or to the right relative to where they were.

761
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,559
 and i think mark pinkis has basically put himself in that category.

762
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:44,080
 so there's people who have like been red pilling and moving over to our side.

763
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,200
 and then i'd say the other half

764
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,320
 people in the room haven't necessarily

765
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,400
 changed their politics and they're just there to do business.

766
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,559
 they want to have a good relationship with the government.

767
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,159
 but the same is true on the part of the president.

768
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,840
 you i saw some conservative influencers

769
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,399
 saying, "how can the president meet with this person or that person?

770
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,559
 he's been such an opponent in the past."

771
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,720
 i mean, look, the president is doing business as well.

772
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,640
 he asks all the attendees

773
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,039
 of the dinner, "how much are you investing in america?"

774
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,480
 you know, what do you need to invest more?

775
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,360
 he wants to see the infrastructure investment.

776
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,760
 why?

777
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,559
 because it benefits all americans, not just software companies.

778
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
 it benefits the construction industry, the trades, the electricians,

779
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,880
 the carpenters, the energy companies,

780
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,760
 fracking

781
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,240
 and so on.

782
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,960
 so he he's there representing the interests of the country

783
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,559
 and then many of those ceos are representing the interests of their companies

784
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,600
 and there's a dialogue

785
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,240
 going on

786
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,080
 and it doesn't mean that everyone has to like suddenly

787
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,880
 become a republican

788
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
 or change their politics.

789
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,360
 but it's constructive and this is all in furtherance of having the us economy grow better.

790
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,720
 all right, perfect segue.

791
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,480
 we got lots to talk about in terms of the economy.

792
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,799
 and first story here, trump's tariffs got overturned in court.

793
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:54,559
 federal appeals court ruled 74 that trump exceeded his authority when it comes to the

794
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,799
 emergency economic powers act.

795
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,120
 okay, we'll get into the details here.

796
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,080
 historically, congress was in charge of tariffs, but under an emergency, a national emergency,

797
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,480
 the president can get involved with tariffs.

798
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,399
 and they cited

799
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:17,520
 the 47th administration fentinyl crisis at the borders, mexico, canada, china, etc., and the trade deficits.

800
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,120
 well, the white house got sued by a group representing small businesses.

801
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,360
 in may, two federal courts ruled that he wrongfully

802
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,000
 invoked the ea and the white house appealed that.

803
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,120
 they've now lost and trump's tariffs will remain in effect until october 14th

804
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,520
 allowing the supreme court to appeal this.

805
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,760
 these tariffs have been tremendously unpopular in the business sector.

806
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,120
 i think maybe 70 80% of business leaders in a recent survey

807
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,919
 sack said that they don't they're not crazy about them.

808
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,640
 but they have on the other side generated over $150

809
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440
 billion in revenue in a couple of short months.

810
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,640
 so they could generate trillions of dollars in the next decade according to estimates.

811
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,000
 i guess the question i have for you sachs is you guys are moving

812
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,559
 at the white house there in this administration, the executive branch at startup speed,

813
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,279
 moving fast and break things is something we talk about doing in our

814
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,799
 industry and is this just the natural extension of that?

815
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,919
 the president is doing a lot of aggressive things and sometimes

816
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,440
 they're going to be allowed, sometimes they're not.

817
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,080
 what's your take?

818
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,600
 well, i'm not concerned about the fate of tariffs at the supreme court,

819
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,960
 even though it's probably

820
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,080
 a coin flip, whether the supreme court's going to allow the tariffs under aipa,

821
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,799
 but there are five different

822
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,960
 laws under which the president has the authority to impose these tariffs.

823
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,320
 so, there's a chart here that we can throw up on the screen.

824
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,799
 there's section 232, there's section 2011, section 301, section 122, section 338.

825
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,679
 there are at least five different bases for the president's

826
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,000
 authority to impose tariffs.

827
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,279
 so, at the end of the day, i think it's actually quite unlikely

828
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,360
 that the supreme court's going to force a change in tariff policy.

829
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
 and i don't think the supreme court

830
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,679
 sees it as this urgent matter that requires a a quick resolution.

831
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,200
 so, i'm not particularly worried about it.

832
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,120
 in terms of the popularity of the tariffs,

833
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,520
 my guess is that they're not going to be reversed

834
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,600
 in the future by a future president because i think they actually are quite popular

835
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,840
 with the country, with workers.

836
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,480
 among the business elite, it's more mixed.

837
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,679
 i'll grant you that.

838
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,799
 but if you change the way you ask the question

839
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,120
 from are you in favor of these tariffs to

840
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,279
 are you in favor of

841
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,240
 raising

842
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,880
 4 trillion

843
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,200
 in revenue over the next decade through tariffs

844
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:39,919
 to fund

845
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,039
 a tax cut

846
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,200
 like we had in the big beautiful bill

847
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,679
 then that might change people's perception of it.

848
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,919
 so that's really the question is is

849
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,840
 how do you want to raise revenue for the government?

850
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,640
 and between big beautiful bill

851
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,760
 and the tariffs, what you see is a substitution from taxing americans to taxing

852
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,720
 foreign companies unless those foreign companies then make a big investment in america.

853
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,279
 so look, there's no great way to extract revenue from the private sector.

854
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,880
 all taxation is is unfortunate and undesirable

855
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,000
 and be better if we didn't have to tax so much.

856
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,360
 but the reality is i think that if you have a choice between

857
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,399
 taxing american people or imposing tariffs,

858
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,480
 i think tariffs may be the better way to do it.

859
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,600
 and i just want to note that the cbo

860
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,640
 has now increased their projection

861
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,279
 of what tariffs will raise to 4 trillion over the next decade.

862
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,799
 so 400 billion a year.

863
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,320
 it's pretty significant, right?

864
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,840
 and initially it started as a lower number and it completely pays

865
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,519
 for the one big beautiful bill.

866
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,720
 chimoth, here's the chart.

867
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
 tar trump's tariffs were meant to help manufacturers.

868
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,279
 do manufacturing firms think they're helping?

869
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,640
 has your business been impacted by higher tariffs this year?

870
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,240
 and here negative impact 72% of manufacturers.

871
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,559
 3.7% think it helped and 17% said no impact.

872
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,399
 7% don't know yet.

873
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:03,679
 your thoughts on tariffs?

874
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,360
 are obviously unpopular with people in retail manufacturing

875
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,240
 in those businesses,

876
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,960
 but as

877
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,080
 axe points out,

878
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,039
 hey, maybe the american

879
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,279
 people like them and they like the idea of a new revenue

880
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:13,600
 stream.

881
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,720
 what are your thoughts, shiman?

882
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,880
 i think that the tariffs on balance are a pretty smart master stroke of strategy.

883
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,960
 i think that we did not understand

884
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:34,320
 what the impact of tariffs would be except for hypothetical econ wonk talk.

885
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,080
 and so that hypothetical

886
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,720
 econ wonk talk basically said that tariffs

887
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,559
 were always going to be a disaster.

888
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,960
 and if you ask them, well, what is the actual practical

889
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
 data that you would point to?

890
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,840
 they didn't have any.

891
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,559
 it was just more hypothesis.

892
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,159
 but what is the practical data now?

893
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,600
 i think that the united states is going to book

894
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,320
 probably close to half a trillion of of incremental revenue.

895
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,840
 it's actually forced a stabilization in the dollar,

896
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,359
 which i think that people were always very concerned with.

897
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,359
 what's going to happen to the dollar complex?

898
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,040
 everybody always screams like with a like their hair is on fire.

899
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,359
 but the dollar complex has stabilized, i think, because of tariffs.

900
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,879
 so, there's been some real positives.

901
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,918
 and what sax says is right, which is whoever is president over the next,

902
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,480
 you know, 5, 10, 15,

903
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,320
 20, 30 years, there'll be some democrats, there'll be some republicans.

904
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,399
 it's going to be very hard to justify why you would undo this now

905
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,520
 because this source of revenue is going to be an incredibly important one.

906
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,639
 well, and also it's not just the fact that the revenue is very important.

907
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,560
 you rais a great point, which is the us government's

908
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,280
 going to become dependent

909
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,639
 on that revenue, but also

910
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,359
 just workers.

911
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,639
 i think the tariffs are very popular with bluecollar workers.

912
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,399
 auto workers really like it.

913
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,520
 well, here's what i was going to this the the pie chart that you showed

914
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,240
 is not accurate.

915
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,240
 and the reason it's not accurate is that the investment cases

916
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,320
 that you would underwrite because of tariffs and the big beautiful bill haven't happened.

917
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,040
 so, i'll give you an example.

918
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,760
 i am a person that started a business that is building a factory

919
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,599
 to make batteries in my specific example in michigan.

920
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,400
 so to delever away from china

921
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
 for the battery supply chain

922
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,560
 and what i will tell you jason is after the big beautiful

923
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,800
 bill and because of tariffs

924
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,040
 it is much easier now for me to underwrite.

925
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:33,359
 why?

926
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,200
 because i have 100% depreciation across all my capex

927
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,839
 it's a complete changer on the irra of these projects.

928
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,119
 so before where i would have to raise billions of dollars from outsiders,

929
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,079
 i can subsidize a lot more of it internally

930
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,480
 because i can actually underwrite to a better gain because the the tax savings are

931
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,440
 so meaningful.

932
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,160
 same thing for this data center that i'm building in arizona.

933
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,720
 so

934
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,079
 in all of these cases,

935
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:58,960
 i think that

936
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,599
 a you have this uptick in revenue because of tariffs on the short term and b

937
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,119
 the important thing is to redo this pie chart in probably a year.

938
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,440
 like for example, our groundbreaking in michigan will be in july of next year

939
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,960
 for that factory.

940
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,200
 it'll be online 2 years after that.

941
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,760
 the real story, jason, of all of this will be really known in that period.

942
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
 but right now, what i'll tell you is the underwriting

943
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,440
 case for putting a ton of money into the united states

944
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,000
 has changed to the positive because of these because that 100% depreciation.

945
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,359
 it's a huge deal.

946
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:31,520
 yeah.

947
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,920
 whether you're buying plane, yum yum.

948
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,599
 all in aviation.

949
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,200
 freeberg, here's your poly market.

950
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,560
 will tariffs generate greater than 250 billion?

951
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,480
 it's peaked at like 30%, it's come back down to five.

952
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,599
 most people are betting.

953
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,640
 so, this could be a case of

954
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,040
 free money

955
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,480
 if people want to go get it on poly

956
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,119
 market

957
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,960
 because it has a pretty good chance of hitting that.

958
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,320
 but well, the number the number i said, jason, is like a yearly run rate.

959
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,119
 so, technically,

960
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,480
 if you just look at the calendar

961
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,960
 25,

962
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,160
 you you only get a stub of eight months because it starts april 1st.

963
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,240
 8 months, 50k a month, 50 billion a month to get to 400 billion.

964
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,640
 so they should be able actually think they're going to hit that bogey.

965
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,920
 but freeberg, the reports from people who have been impacted by tariffs.

966
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,240
 obviously these could become inflationary,

967
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,640
 but the people who are being impacted said they've been eating them to date,

968
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,800
 but they're not going to be able to eat them forever.

969
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,960
 so it could become inflationary.

970
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,680
 what are your thoughts on the tariff kfluffle here and and the legal battle over them

971
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,040
 as well as the impact it might have on inflation

972
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,480
 which is something we do not want to see come back and we have been teetering

973
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,760
 just under that 3%

974
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,480
 number

975
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,640
 which then puts the fed obviously in difficult

976
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,760
 position with their mandate

977
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,000
 to get to two freeberg

978
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,320
 i'll address the legal kurfuffle

979
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,359
 point which i think is a good one because i do think

980
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,839
 that the great debate that's going to happen from this presidency

981
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,880
 and will likely shape the next set of presidencies

982
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:05,040
 will be the right for presidents to declare emergencies to move forward their legislative agenda

983
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,599
 and arguably the tariff

984
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,520
 institution by many members of congress should have gone through a congressional process.

985
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,720
 in the meeting i did with ran paul this week which has now been posted,

986
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,240
 he talked about

987
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,880
 the challenge that they have had with democratic presidents biden and

988
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,240
 prior to that

989
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,000
 using emergency authorization

990
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,760
 vested to them under the national emergencies act which is a 1976

991
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,119
 statutory authority to take action and then in order for

992
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:37,920
 the emergency

993
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,599
 powers to be turned off,

994
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,280
 congress actually has to vote

995
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,359
 and they can only do so after 30 days.

996
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,119
 and when congress makes that vote, the president can veto their vote.

997
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:49,839
 so the president

998
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,240
 can then say, "send it back." so then they have to get a two-third

999
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:52,960
 supermajority

1000
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,480
 to get it to pass.

1001
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,680
 so it creates a system whereby the president can have this emergency authorization

1002
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,040
 to progress much of their legislative agenda under the guise of emergency powers,

1003
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,079
 which

1004
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,640
 you know, for many people they would say is not the right way to do it.

1005
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,440
 so,

1006
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,760
 senator paul and others have proposed bills,

1007
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,160
 for example, that the president has to get any emergency

1008
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,359
 power reauthorized

1009
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,520
 after 30 days

1010
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,240
 and then it can only be a maximum of 90 days without

1011
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,040
 congress enacting

1012
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,320
 a a renewal.

1013
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,640
 and so, it requires actual congressional action to continue the authority

1014
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,320
 of that emergency power depending on what the supreme court does or doesn't do.

1015
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,160
 i think it is going to catalyze

1016
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
 a legislative push

1017
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,480
 and the republicans

1018
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,760
 are likely not going to embrace it this presidency or this term because

1019
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
 president trump is in office.

1020
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,040
 but i think the conversation

1021
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,079
 that some,

1022
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,320
 you know, out of the box republicans

1023
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,920
 like senator paul and others are saying is, well, what's going to happen next time?

1024
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,320
 what's going to happen when there's a democrat president and we don't aoc is going to

1025
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,119
 emergency powers to do something you might not like, right?

1026
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,000
 is that your point?

1027
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,160
 yeah.

1028
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,680
 and so as it relates to both the aipa of 1977,

1029
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,480
 which is the act that this case is about,

1030
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,079
 but also the national emergencies act of 1976,

1031
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,480
 should they go back and pass a new law that basically

1032
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:08,960
 forces

1033
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,480
 the president to have to get congressional

1034
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,359
 approval

1035
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,880
 for any emergency to last longer than 30 days?

1036
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,119
 so

1037
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:15,760
 i do think that's

1038
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,480
 going to be the big debate

1039
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:16,720
 that's

1040
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,000
 going to come out of this.

1041
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,720
 as it relates to the tariff revenue,

1042
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
 i am most worried about the fact

1043
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,320
 that we use the tariff revenue,

1044
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,440
 as i said before,

1045
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,960
 to offset spending

1046
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,359
 and basically keep a baseline of spending without actually getting ourselves to that deficit

1047
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,400
 target.

1048
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,240
 right now, we are going to vaporize and create debt of $2 trillion this fiscal year.

1049
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,119
 so,

1050
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,880
 we're using the

1051
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,000
 the tariff revenue under the cdo scoring

1052
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,160
 to basically say, "hey, we can do these tax cuts because it's offset."

1053
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,920
 but the goal shouldn't be to offset.

1054
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,520
 the goal should be to get cuts to actually reduce the deficit.

1055
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,040
 and so, that's the biggest concern i have with respect to the tariffs long term

1056
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,599
 is it's

1057
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,400
 now a new revenue

1058
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,920
 source that we don't actually treat as

1059
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,319
 incremental

1060
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:01,200
 to reduce deficit.

1061
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,359
 we just use it as a way to introduce new spending or continue spending.

1062
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,640
 sachs, just to

1063
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,720
 um you know talk about the three branches of government, wouldn't

1064
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,400
 it also be an option for the president

1065
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,280
 just to go to congress

1066
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,240
 with some of these tariffs

1067
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,920
 and say, "hey, can i get these approved?"

1068
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,520
 would that be the worst thing in the world?

1069
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
 wouldn't they vote for it?

1070
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,880
 i mean, but yeah, things take time.

1071
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,960
 do you have concerns that president aoc

1072
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
 might do some things with executive powers that the republican

1073
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,599
 party might be opposed to if she

1074
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,040
 winds up winning in 2028?

1075
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,680
 that's an important question, sax, is if aocc's president and then she uses her emergency authorization

1076
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,079
 to do things that you disagree with,

1077
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,119
 wouldn't the republicans

1078
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,400
 then feel regret that they didn't pass one of these acts that

1079
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,800
 limits emergency authorization and power?

1080
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,720
 well, look, i i think that in general,

1081
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,920
 when you have a policy

1082
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,520
 that you want to last

1083
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,440
 for a long time, the best thing to do is to codify it into law

1084
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,079
 because executive orders obviously

1085
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,319
 only last until the next president decides they don't want them anymore.

1086
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,400
 so yeah, it may make sense after the administration

1087
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,319
 hopefully wins its case to seek to codify these things into law.

1088
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,880
 we have a few years to do that,

1089
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
 but i don't think it makes sense to wait for congress

1090
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,640
 to act because they may never act.

1091
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,760
 and in fact, it was president trump who shifted the whole debate on this topic.

1092
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,400
 i mean, the whole establishment of both the republican and democrat parties were

1093
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,880
 very against tariffs and it's pretty obvious that nothing would have happened on this issue

1094
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,599
 and he's completely moved the debate.

1095
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,880
 so, this is just one where i think he's acted unilaterally because he had to.

1096
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
 but i think that once these tariffs are in place for a few years, i don't

1097
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,200
 think they're

1098
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,680
 going to get

1099
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,000
 pulled

1100
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,200
 back by a future president

1101
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,400
 because i think they're going to

1102
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,440
 it's too much money become

1103
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,000
 quite popular.

1104
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,119
 it's too much money.

1105
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,520
 okay.

1106
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,359
 in the other cases, two more lower courts have ruled against trump.

1107
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,400
 one said the deployment of the marines and the national guard were illegal.

1108
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,800
 one said he can't freeze research funds for harvard.

1109
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,200
 so, again, back to moving fast and breaking things.

1110
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,680
 these cases are making their way through the courts and there has been some resistance

1111
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,720
 to

1112
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:11,119
 sending in the national guard which is something there's been a bit of saber rattling chimoth

1113
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,040
 about maybe going into chicago next.

1114
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,079
 what are your thoughts on the national guard issue?

1115
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,920
 they should look here's the thing.

1116
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,240
 who is against safety and security?

1117
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,280
 who and why?

1118
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,800
 i don't understand.

1119
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,200
 so if you can't do your job, look, you have to remember jason,

1120
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,319
 let's take where we live in california, where you used to live.

1121
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:34,640
 yep.

1122
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,520
 not anymore.

1123
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,119
 13% of our income goes towards state coffers

1124
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,160
 and then we pay

1125
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,760
 real estate taxes and all of the stuff that goes to local municipalities.

1126
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,280
 what are you doing with that money if you're not making the places we live safe?

1127
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,560
 and then the second thing would be making the schools good.

1128
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,960
 and so if you can't do it, if you can't do it, of course

1129
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,240
 somebody else should step in.

1130
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,560
 and frankly, what i have heard consistently

1131
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,839
 is even though the talking point has to be, "oh my god, woe is me.

1132
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,200
 we can do the job."

1133
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,640
 everybody behind the scenes like, "oh, thank god they're here." anybody who is being impacted

1134
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,079
 by crime would like to see the national guard come in and remove encampments

1135
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,640
 or drug dealers or get drugs off the

1136
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,520
 streets.

1137
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,079
 saxs, you know, you're a

1138
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,040
 um

1139
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,440
 my perception would be that you think

1140
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,200
 that there should be separations between the executive branch and

1141
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,760
 maybe the states and that this rule breaking

1142
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,240
 of sending in the national guard that would go against

1143
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,720
 the rules of the sovereignty of the states.

1144
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,160
 so, putting aside chamat's

1145
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,079
 point, which is completely valid, that they haven't done a good job here and

1146
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,880
 it it is illegal as the judges are pointing out, do you have concerns about that?

1147
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,200
 okay.

1148
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,440
 well, first of all, i reject this characterization

1149
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,440
 that it's the trump administration that's moved fast and breaking things.

1150
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,240
 if you recall fast, let's just say moving fast.

1151
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,560
 well, i think the president is taking swift executive actions that are popular.

1152
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,800
 and you see this actually in his poll ratings.

1153
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,880
 he got the highest approval rating he's ever had just in the last week.

1154
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,560
 and a big part of it is because of the reduction in crime in dc.

1155
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,359
 i think he got to 55% approval on poll rating.

1156
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,440
 and even in dc, by the way,

1157
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,160
 the mayor and her staff have said all sorts of positive things about the help

1158
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,920
 they've received now from the national guard and from the federal government.

1159
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,079
 and the citizens are extremely happy.

1160
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,119
 crime is down.

1161
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,000
 i think we had the first two weeks where there was no murders

1162
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,680
 in the capital in a long time.

1163
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,359
 the residents are very happy.

1164
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,119
 so, this is definitely working.

1165
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:33,200
 now, with respect to california,

1166
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,520
 let me just point out that

1167
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,839
 the national guard wasn't called in specifically to enforce laws on the street.

1168
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,480
 what happened was that you had ice and homeland security agents

1169
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,520
 and workers were doing their job

1170
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,480
 and they were conducting some deportations and then you had protests

1171
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,160
 turn into riots and those protesters were threatening to burn down

1172
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,760
 their headquarters and that's why the national guard had to be sent in.

1173
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,000
 so, it wasn't the trump administration breaking things.

1174
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,560
 it was riers who were breaking things.

1175
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,200
 i can't understand for the life of me why

1176
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,359
 the administration wouldn't be able to send in the national guard to protect

1177
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,040
 federal workers against riers, but apparently that's the case.

1178
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,440
 so, look, i think the court reached a very specific decision about what happened in california.

1179
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,680
 we still haven't had a case adjudicating the question of whether

1180
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,119
 the proposed interventions

1181
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,599
 in in these blue states to clean up crime

1182
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,480
 will be allowed over the objections of democrat governors.

1183
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,599
 we don't know.

1184
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,960
 i think it's pretty clear that the dc intervention will be allowed and it's extremely popular.

1185
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,280
 and look, the dc one he's legally allowed to do.

1186
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,119
 so yeah, he's got he's got his what was it?

1187
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,079
 a 30-day mandate.

1188
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:42,960
 he can take it over.

1189
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,119
 and so here's your popularity from the economist.

1190
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,720
 it is ticking up, but

1191
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,839
 um trump and the country still seems pretty divided.

1192
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:58,560
 41% approved, 55% disapproved, 3% unsure, but he has moved up significantly in the last week.

1193
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,400
 today, some big news came out friday with the soft jobs report.

1194
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,760
 pretty much bad across the board.

1195
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,000
 jobs came in super light, 22,000 added versus 75,000 expected.

1196
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,800
 most of the gains came from part-time jobs.

1197
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:18,160
 us lost 357 full-time jobs while gaining 597,000 part-time jobs last month.

1198
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,800
 and this is after a bunch of revisions.

1199
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,160
 you guys remember we talked about here a couple of times with these revisions.

1200
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,240
 and we'll show up some charts with long-term revisions.

1201
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:35,440
 july revised up slightly by 6k, 73,000 to 79. in june was revised down significantly.

1202
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,400
 remember that impacted the market by 27,000.

1203
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,200
 this makes june the first month with a net loss of jobs since july of 2021.

1204
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,240
 so there's an account on xcov letter and they did this revisions chart.

1205
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,200
 it's pretty crazy as you can see.

1206
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,040
 may and june revisions

1207
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,079
 were

1208
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,119
 in the six figures and they're constantly revising these down it seems.

1209
00:47:59,119 --> 00:47:59,680
 all right.

1210
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,480
 free break had some internet connectivity issues apparently.

1211
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,160
 but shimoth, let's talk about the revisions here and the softness in the job market concerning.

1212
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,200
 did maybe the fed take too long to get towards cuts in september?

1213
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,760
 what what is what's your read on this and the endless revisions?

1214
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,240
 look, i think that i've said this yes last week, i think, right?

1215
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,640
 so i'll just say it again this week.

1216
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,119
 you can't run the most sophisticated

1217
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:34,400
 economy in the world if you have data that is completely unreliable in either direction.

1218
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,760
 and so

1219
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,720
 the problem with this jobs report is there are already two competing versions of the truth.

1220
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:48,160
 one group of people are trying to paint the jobs report as everything is working.

1221
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,079
 there's nothing to see here.

1222
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,079
 another group of people are saying, "oh, well, hold on.

1223
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,400
 there's a birth stats number where if you

1224
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,359
 extract that out the jobs numbers is actually negative.

1225
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,359
 i don't know

1226
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:05,760
 which one is actually better in terms of

1227
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,960
 where we want to be right now going into a rate cut cycle.

1228
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,559
 so my general commentary is the following.

1229
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,160
 the bls and their approach is incredibly brittle.

1230
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,000
 it doesn't work.

1231
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:25,040
 i think commerce has taken the first right step which is to start publishing

1232
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,720
 useful economic data into the blockchain.

1233
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,359
 i think we need to figure out a way and this is where congress

1234
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,280
 should get their act together

1235
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,800
 and pass an incentive or a requirement

1236
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,960
 for certain parts of the critical economic infrastructure of america

1237
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:47,040
 to report their data in an anonymized way into a broad set of blockchains.

1238
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:53,359
 and the reason is that you will have very astute and precise pricing oracles

1239
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,839
 help distill that information.

1240
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,920
 so if you're adp, if you're american express, if you're stripe,

1241
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,280
 there's an imperative now for you to contribute the information you have into a broad

1242
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:05,680
 collection

1243
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,319
 of information

1244
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:07,440
 so that we have an accurate

1245
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,040
 sense of what the hell is actually

1246
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,240
 going on.

1247
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,839
 because i can't react to this number because i don't know how it's going to change.

1248
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,640
 it could literally swing by 200,000 in either direction.

1249
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,800
 jason, this is a i think a really good point.

1250
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,599
 here's some research.

1251
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,160
 i had my put one of my researchers at launch on this.

1252
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,319
 here's 2021 and the initial reading first revision and we did this for the year sach.

1253
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,640
 so, as you can see in 2021, they missed it by 1.9 million

1254
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,559
 which was about 15%.

1255
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,880
 2022 they miraculously nailed it.

1256
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,160
 2023 they were off by 10%.

1257
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,920
 2024 it looks like they were off again by 10%.

1258
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,920
 all this is revising down by the way.

1259
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,119
 in the first half of this year.

1260
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,640
 let me just finish the chart.

1261
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,079
 first half of this year, initial reading 985,

1262
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,520
 first revision 732,

1263
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,960
 second revision 497. so they were off by 50% so far this year alone.

1264
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,440
 this chart is itself inaccurate.

1265
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,280
 the table is and and it's because it's coming from the same people that measured.

1266
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,880
 so you're asking the people that measured to grade themselves

1267
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,079
 and i suspect that the answer is actually much worse than all of this.

1268
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,400
 now, what is the implication of it?

1269
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,960
 the implication of it is if you take the most positive

1270
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,760
 view possible,

1271
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,400
 it's that the people that then control the levers of the economy

1272
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,839
 don't actually have accurate data.

1273
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,480
 so, they'll be hesitant to act until the data is overwhelming.

1274
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,119
 the most important lens of that will be the fed and what they do with rates.

1275
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,880
 and so, everybody's like, "oh, wow.

1276
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,319
 there's a 99% chance of a 25 basis point cut."

1277
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:43,359
 that may be wildly wildly wildly conservative in terms of the the total amount

1278
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:47,359
 that they need to be thinking about and how they should phase that in.

1279
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,280
 but how would i actually prove that to you?

1280
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,040
 i can point to a whole litany of private data,

1281
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,480
 but the problem is the federal actors use public data

1282
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,079
 and this data is not useful.

1283
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:06,079
 and i think that when you get private data into your hands, which i know that

1284
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,800
 other folks have, hedge funds, banks,

1285
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,359
 the white house, what they see is different

1286
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,079
 than what the fed sees.

1287
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:22,640
 so what i would tell you from this jobs report is it's going to start again

1288
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,400
 this clamor of what is your plan?

1289
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,319
 clapping is not a strategy.

1290
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:36,559
 so a 25 basis point cut to a $32 trillion economy is not a strategy.

1291
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,119
 and i

1292
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:38,160
 think that the reason they

1293
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,440
 don't know what to do exactly

1294
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,119
 is because they have extremely

1295
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,400
 faulty data.

1296
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:42,880
 again,

1297
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,119
 this is not i'm i'm not taking a position on this

1298
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,720
 or framing it as if i'm taking a position.

1299
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,920
 i'm just reporting the data here as they've reported it.

1300
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,680
 so i'm i'm just doing that here just to be clear here that i'm not endorsing

1301
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,480
 any side of this.

1302
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,200
 i'm an independent.

1303
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,920
 i'm a moderate.

1304
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,920
 i'm just giving you the data as it stands.

1305
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,079
 here's the fred chart just so we can zoom out and see unemployment since the 50s.

1306
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,160
 we're still at historic lows and there's a slight uptick 4.3%

1307
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:11,520
 which is the highest unemployment since 2021 but it's absurdly low historically.

1308
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:16,720
 so even we're looking historically sachs we're still at very low but do you have concerns

1309
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,200
 that the economy could be slowing and that we could have a jobs issue?

1310
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,040
 that i guess is the question that

1311
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,040
 is filling the airwaves on cnbc

1312
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,119
 and that everybody's talking about in group chats.

1313
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,480
 are we

1314
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:34,400
 maybe didn't make the fed cuts in time for what clearly is some amount of slowing?

1315
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,720
 now, we could argue over if they're getting the data right or not.

1316
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,280
 the fed says they look at all data, not just this data.

1317
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,599
 they say they look at the private data as well.

1318
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:43,920
 but what are your thoughts here, sachs?

1319
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,640
 well, we had 22,000 jobs added in august.

1320
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,920
 and yet, while the number of jobs went up, unemployment

1321
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,000
 rose, like you said, from 4.2

1322
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,920
 to 4.3%.

1323
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,000
 which is a little bit of a contradiction, but that happened because more people started looking

1324
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,200
 for jobs.

1325
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,680
 yeah.

1326
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,000
 but there are huge error bars around this data.

1327
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,520
 like jamal said, i mean, like you showed, there's roughly 50% revisions

1328
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,359
 to all of this data over time over the course of a year.

1329
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,160
 so, we don't really have great visibility in what's going on.

1330
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:19,119
 and that's why you see such huge disparities in how people are interpreting this data.

1331
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,920
 so if you want to look at some of the people who are pessimistic,

1332
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,119
 you've got coobe letter, but they're pessimistic about everything.

1333
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,760
 you've got moody's economist mark xandandy.

1334
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,839
 he says we're on the precipice of a recession

1335
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,079
 and he has a bunch of reasons why.

1336
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,359
 but then if you look at poly market, people on poly market

1337
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,480
 are strongly betting against a recession this year.

1338
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,119
 i think the number is at about 8%.

1339
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,079
 so, it appears that most people still feel like the economy is doing well.

1340
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,359
 and remember, we just had a 3.3%

1341
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:53,280
 gdp growth rate for q2. so, i i'd be surprised if if there's a recession.

1342
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,559
 i think there's a lot of factors against it.

1343
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,920
 i guess i would also note that if there's any weakness in the job numbers,

1344
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,240
 it's coming from foreignb born workers

1345
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,079
 more than native born workers.

1346
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:10,400
 around 2 million more americanborn workers have jobs in 2025 so far.

1347
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:16,559
 and i think meanwhile about a million foreignb born workers roughly have lost jobs.

1348
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,480
 so the net increase is about a million.

1349
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,880
 but what you're seeing is a repatriation in a way of jobs within the economy.

1350
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,200
 the other thing that's happening is a reprivatization of the economy.

1351
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,359
 so in august the federal government shed about 15,000 jobs

1352
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,280
 and there's been 100,000 federal jobs lost

1353
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,960
 over the course of the whole year.

1354
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,119
 so that makes the overall numbers look worse than they are.

1355
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:42,640
 but i a lot of us would argue that

1356
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,200
 having fewer

1357
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:43,520
 federal

1358
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:43,920
 workers

1359
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,680
 is a good thing for the economy.

1360
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,880
 so you've got those factors.

1361
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,240
 then you've got blue collar real wages are rising the second fastest in history.

1362
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,760
 you had 3.7% wage growth this year versus 2.7% average inflation.

1363
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,920
 so you have a net 1% wage growth during most of the biden presidency.

1364
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,160
 it was negative.

1365
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,640
 and then i would also point to

1366
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,720
 i think several factors which would make me optimistic about

1367
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,400
 the economy moving ahead.

1368
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,440
 you've had massive investment in the us by both private companies and foreign governments.

1369
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,079
 you know, according to these new trade deals, i think roughly $8 trillion of new investment.

1370
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,760
 you've got this ai boom you're seeing.

1371
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,680
 and that's going to land over the next year, right?

1372
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,200
 that hasn't actually been dumped in.

1373
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,240
 so we should see that in 2027, maybe late 2026. yeah.

1374
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,400
 yeah.

1375
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,040
 this is the outlook for 2026 and beyond.

1376
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,599
 i mean, this would be the bull case is number one,

1377
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,319
 $8 trillion

1378
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,520
 of of new investment

1379
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,480
 in the us economy

1380
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,680
 by private companies

1381
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,680
 and by foreign governments.

1382
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,200
 number two, the ai boom.

1383
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,040
 you've got this massive buildout of data centers and ai infrastructure underway.

1384
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,319
 and that includes energy and the manufacturing sectors are going to boom alongside tech.

1385
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,920
 number three, this has been the most affordable summer at the pump since 2021,

1386
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,040
 and low gas prices don't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.

1387
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,920
 so, lowest gas prices since 2021.

1388
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,520
 number four, you have these huge new tax incentives for business expansion.

1389
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,720
 you've got the accelerated depreciation on equipment purchases, on r&d.

1390
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,559
 i think those are going to kick in once the big beautiful bill goes into effect.

1391
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,319
 and then the last thing i would say is that interest rate cuts are coming.

1392
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,440
 i would say that now in light of the latest jobs report,

1393
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,079
 pal should really cut 50 basis points.

1394
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,079
 i doubt he will in september 25. yeah, i doubt he will.

1395
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,720
 it's probably be 25 and then hopefully another 25.

1396
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,000
 but i think you can make the case that they should do 50 now and then

1397
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,280
 25 after that.

1398
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,960
 but regardless of what it is, i think that most people think interest rates are coming

1399
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,640
 and that's going to juice the economy and further improve our fiscal position.

1400
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,280
 so look for 26, i think there's a lot of bullish factors here.

1401
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,319
 all right, just

1402
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,319
 before we wrap here, google,

1403
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,000
 uh, as we know, was found liable in this antitrust case, but

1404
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,040
 the sanctions

1405
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,640
 seem to

1406
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,799
 not be as harsh as people thought they would be.

1407
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:11,760
 judge meta rejected the request that google have to spin off chrome, android,

1408
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,480
 and pointed out that google is having massive competition.

1409
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,559
 so we had four years of lena khan, you know, in these aggressive cases.

1410
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,240
 there were there were tactical things we talked about here like dark patterns,

1411
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,599
 etc. that we all agreed with.

1412
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,240
 i think there was consensus there, but this one we found a little confusing because

1413
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,000
 gosh, google's under so much pressure.

1414
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,599
 what are your thoughts on i thought this was excellent.

1415
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:38,640
 unpack it all.

1416
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,599
 essentially,

1417
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,680
 the crux of the ruling

1418
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,480
 was look, there are some restrictions that google has to live by.

1419
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:50,000
 don't get me wrong, but the most punitive remedies that were suggested were thrown out.

1420
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,599
 and the reason they were thrown out was because the judge very eloquently cited

1421
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:58,880
 competition in a fair and free and open market.

1422
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,240
 and that is incredibly refreshing because the real question is

1423
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,480
 would this judge have had the wherewithal

1424
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,799
 and the courage to actually be able to rule this way

1425
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:14,799
 a few years ago when there would have been an enormous amount of political pressure.

1426
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:15,040
 they

1427
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,280
 probably

1428
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,319
 would have found a way to to

1429
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:16,720
 run this

1430
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,440
 case in a in

1431
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:17,839
 a different

1432
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:18,400
 place

1433
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,119
 etc etc. but now what you saw was just

1434
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:22,799
 very simple logic

1435
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:23,440
 intervene.

1436
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,440
 and at the core of it was,

1437
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,680
 you know, when we started this lawsuit, things like openai and chat gpt didn't exist.

1438
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,720
 and when you fast forward, it's incredibly fastm moving.

1439
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,000
 we are reallocating hundreds of millions or billions of users intentions.

1440
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,760
 as a byproduct, we're reallocating tens of maybe hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue.

1441
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,760
 and so the judge said the most severe

1442
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,799
 remedies aren't necessary because the free market is doing its job.

1443
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,119
 yes.

1444
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,839
 so i i just think that's incredibly refreshing because we forget

1445
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:58,319
 that if the market is left to deal with these issues on its own,

1446
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,720
 they do a very good job of cleaning things up.

1447
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:06,079
 and it's because as you said earlier, jason, consumers want creative destruction.

1448
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,599
 they want the next best thing.

1449
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,839
 they want to be better prices better services.

1450
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,359
 it's it happens by the free market.

1451
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:14,559
 they're willing they're willing to reward better companies and better products.

1452
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:20,960
 so i think the the great news for google is that this takes an enormous

1453
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,880
 risk off the table.

1454
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,200
 and now i think that they probably have even more

1455
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,680
 ambition

1456
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,240
 and energy

1457
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,079
 to just go for it and try to compete

1458
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,400
 because

1459
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,079
 they're not going to be worried

1460
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,680
 about everybody on the outside

1461
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,480
 and probably

1462
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,319
 some percentage of employees on the inside

1463
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,319
 who are always trying to slow things down.

1464
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:38,799
 yeah.

1465
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:40,079
 and and

1466
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:43,040
 it out correctly and i'll let you comment on this sachs

1467
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,559
 is that they did get some tactical,

1468
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,839
 you know, penalties here.

1469
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:50,559
 uh, and they make sense doing

1470
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,920
 deals that are exclusive when you are a monopoly player, like getting

1471
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,480
 firefox and apple to only do an exclusive deal with you.

1472
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,400
 they're not going to be allowed to do that.

1473
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,680
 and man, that would change the game on the field if somebody like duck.go

1474
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,000
 or bing or a new entrant, proplexity,

1475
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,040
 whoever who's doing search would be able to say to apple,

1476
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,680
 we will outbid google for 10% of the searches.

1477
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,520
 we'd like to buy 5% of the searches

1478
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,240
 from the

1479
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:16,720
 safari

1480
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,200
 browser

1481
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,240
 going to firefox

1482
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,839
 and saying, "hey, we'd like to

1483
01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:20,160
 one

1484
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:20,799
 up and we'd

1485
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:21,599
 like some percentage

1486
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:24,079
 of that." so, that seemed like a good part of the ruling.

1487
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,400
 your thoughts overall about this?

1488
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,599
 so on this podcast,

1489
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,559
 i think it was two or three years ago when this case first came up.

1490
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,440
 i think i took the position that google street broken up into two or three companies

1491
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,040
 because i thought it was this invulnerable

1492
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,040
 monopoly and i don't think monopolies are great for the sar ecosystem.

1493
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,440
 and what i mean by that is they had the

1494
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,520
 google search monopoly and that youtube

1495
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,839
 business which is basically a monopoly and so forth and so on.

1496
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:48,400
 so, i i

1497
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,200
 was in favor of breaking

1498
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:49,920
 this up, but i've

1499
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,319
 got to admit

1500
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:50,559
 i

1501
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:50,960
 was wrong

1502
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,200
 about

1503
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:51,680
 that

1504
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,160
 for

1505
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,960
 the reasons that the judge said, which is

1506
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,799
 google for the first time in a long while, is existentially threatened

1507
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,240
 by what's happened with ai.

1508
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,599
 i mean, their cash cow, the core of their business is search,

1509
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,880
 and people are starting to substitute in droves

1510
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,640
 from traditional

1511
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,640
 google search, which they own, or keyword search, where they have this monopoly or dominant share

1512
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,240
 to ai.

1513
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,319
 and if you look at ai revenue,

1514
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,000
 i think something like 90% of it is going to

1515
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:22,640
 open ai.

1516
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,160
 i mean, they have the dominant position among consumers for now for now.

1517
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:28,720
 and there's,

1518
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,240
 let's say, five major ai

1519
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:33,200
 companies that are hot on their heels and very competitive

1520
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,480
 and performing equally if not better on performance benchmarks.

1521
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,160
 so the point is just i think everyone can now see

1522
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,920
 that the search business

1523
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:42,640
 is

1524
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,440
 either going away or transforming into something else

1525
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,280
 which is it's basically merging with the it's called ai chatbot

1526
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:49,680
 business.

1527
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,280
 it's an answers business now.

1528
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,640
 it's not a like give me links.

1529
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,160
 it's just give me the damn answer, right?

1530
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,319
 and we've been talking about this for a while where it's so obvious that

1531
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,559
 having ai just give you the answer is better than 20 blue links.

1532
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,839
 especially as the quality improves and it gets better

1533
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:09,599
 at synthesizing those 20 blue links into the exact right answer

1534
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:11,040
 and the speed improves.

1535
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,160
 one of the things that google's really good at is just fast responses.

1536
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,559
 you they've always shown you in milliseconds

1537
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,480
 how long it takes to give you the search result.

1538
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,280
 and obviously

1539
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:22,480
 if you're looking for something quick and an ai chatbot's

1540
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,039
 going to take 30 seconds, you're going to go with google.

1541
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,960
 but that's going to get better, too.

1542
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,160
 so i think google is kind of in the fight of its life right now.

1543
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,240
 and i think this is why sergey's come back.

1544
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,000
 you know, we saw him at the

1545
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,520
 at the dinner at the white house yesterday

1546
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,480
 and he said he's

1547
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,039
 very involved

1548
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:37,359
 in

1549
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:37,680
 google

1550
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,160
 deep mind.

1551
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,160
 he's going to the office all the time.

1552
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:40,480
 yeah.

1553
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:40,640
 right.

1554
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,400
 and so you're seeing that founder

1555
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,119
 involvement

1556
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,520
 again because they know that they've got a real existential threat to their business.

1557
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:50,160
 and this is the argument that

1558
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:50,880
 opponents

1559
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,319
 of strong antitrust enforcement have always made,

1560
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:58,240
 which is that the free market will eventually break up, even the strongest monopolies,

1561
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,160
 if you just give it the chance to do it.

1562
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,440
 and that's what appears to be in motion right now.

1563
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,319
 by the way, i'm not saying that google's going to get destroyed.

1564
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,920
 i'm not saying it's going away.

1565
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,799
 i'm just saying that they have to pivot here in a big way.

1566
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:14,799
 their business is being disrupted and they suddenly have competition

1567
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,680
 i think in their core business like they've never had before.

1568
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:21,280
 so i do think that we don't need to bring the hammer down

1569
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,319
 on them in the same way that maybe we did a few years ago.

1570
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,440
 i still would not let them pursue anti-competitive

1571
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:33,440
 tactics against say applications in the android store where they basically have a duopoly.

1572
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,760
 so i'm not saying i would let them do anything

1573
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,799
 but i certainly

1574
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:39,760
 agree with this judge that we don't need to break up that company right now.

1575
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:39,839
 yeah.

1576
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:40,000
 yeah.

1577
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,400
 and there's there's rules in the field that need to be adjudicated.

1578
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,280
 so having

1579
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,640
 a very simple approach

1580
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,440
 with the ftc

1581
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,880
 of saying, "hey, these exclusive

1582
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,079
 deals when you have 90%

1583
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,920
 market share, that's not allowable.

1584
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,400
 but you can compete and you can fight versus the five new entrance and

1585
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,480
 have at it and and give consumers a better product at a cheaper price."

1586
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,160
 that's really the goal of the ftc

1587
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,319
 is to to have some basic rules of the field.

1588
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,640
 we saw it in the media business as well.

1589
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,119
 we spend a decade or two trying to

1590
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,400
 fight the consolidation

1591
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,480
 of media companies and then netflix

1592
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,559
 has trounced them all and youtube as well in terms of viewership.

1593
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,400
 netflix and youtube are crushing

1594
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,280
 the cable

1595
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:19,839
 monopolies

1596
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,559
 that we spend all this time trying to regulate.

1597
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:24,400
 all right everybody, there's your episode.

1598

1628
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,760
