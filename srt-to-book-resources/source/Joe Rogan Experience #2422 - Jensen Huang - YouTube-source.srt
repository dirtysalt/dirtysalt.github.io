3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,170
> > good to see you again. we were just talking about

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,410
was that the first time we ever spoke or did

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,570
was the first time we spoke at at spacex? > > spacex.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,210
> > spacex.

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,570
the first time when you were giving elon that crazy ai chip,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,769
> > right? djx spark.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,250
> > yeah.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,449
oo, that was a big moment.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,250
that was a huge

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,570
> > that felt crazy to be there. i was like watching these wizards of tech like exchange information

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,210
and

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,170
and you're giving him this crazy device, you know,

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,210
and then the other time was

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:39,690
uh

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,969
i was shooting arrows in my backyard and

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:43,530
uh

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,090
randomly get this call from trump and he's hanging out with you.

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,010
president trump called and i called you. > > yeah.

21
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,170
it's just > > we were talking about you. [laughter] > > it's just talking about

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,530
he was talking about the us ufc thing he was going to do in his front yard.

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,090
> > yeah.

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,370
and he pulls out.

25
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,730
he's jjs, look at this design.

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,570
he's so proud of it.

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,610
and i go, " you're going to have a fight in the front lawn in the white house.

28
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,369
" he goes, " yeah, yeah, you're going to come.

29
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:08,170
this is going to be awesome.

30
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,970
" and he's showing me his design and how beautiful it is.

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,729
and he goes, and somehow your name comes up. he goes, " do you know joe?

32
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,369
" and i said, " yeah, i'm going to be on his podcast.

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:25,130
" he let's call him. [laughter] > > he's like a kid. > > i know.

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:25,770
let's call him.

35
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,170
it's so he's like a 79y old kid.

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,970
> > oh, he's so incredible. > > yeah, he's an odd guy. just very different, you know,

37
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,890
like the what you'd expect from him.

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,130
very different than what people think of him.

39
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,290
and also just very different as a president.

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,770
a guy who just calls you or texts you out of the blue.

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,770
also, he makes when you te you.

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,170
you have an android, so it won't go through with you, but with my iphone, he makes the text go big.

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:50,890
> > like,

44
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,369
you know,

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,090
usa is respected again. like [laughter] all caps

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,210
and it makes the te

47
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,369
the

48
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:57,610
the

49
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,170
the text enlarge is kind of ridiculous. > > well, the the 101 trump president

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,969
trump is very different. he he surprised me

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:07,850
f

52
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,169
first

53
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,410
of all

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,010
he's an incredibly good listener. almost everything i've ever said to him, he's remembered. > > yeah.

55
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,209
people don't

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,410
they only want to look at negative stories about him or negative narratives about him.

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,810
you know, you can catch anybody on a bad day.

58
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,050
like there's a lot of things he does where i don't think he should do.

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,090
like i don't think he should say to a reporter rep reporter, " quiet piggy.

60
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,849
" like that's pretty ridiculous.

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,890
also objectively funny.

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,050
i mean, it's unfortunate that it happened to her.

63
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,690
i wouldn't want that to happen to her, but it was funny.

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,970
just ridiculous that the president does that. i wish he didn't do that.

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,610
but other than that, like he's he's an interesting guy.

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:52,569
like he's a lot of different things wrapped up into one person, you know? you know, part of part of his charm, well, part of his genius is yes.

67
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,970
he says what's on his mind. > > yes.

68
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,090
> > and which is like an anti-olitician in a lot of ways.

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:07,450
> > so, you know, what's on his mind is really what's on his mind, > > which i i do some people some people would rather be lied to.

70
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:07,930
> > yeah.

71
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,530
but but i i like the fact that he's telling you what's on his mind. um,

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:21,050
almost every time he explains something, he says something, he starts with his, you could tell, his love for america, what he wants to do for america.

73
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,730
and everything that he thinks through is very practical and very common sense. and, you know,

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,849
it's very logical

75
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,129
and um

76
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,810
i still remember the first time i i met him

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,409
and so this was i

78
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:38,890
i'd never known him, never met him before. and

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,370
um

80
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:39,849
uh

81
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:44,090
secretary lutnik called and we met right before

82
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,530
right at the beginning of the administration.

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,049
he said he told me what was important to president trump

84
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,930
that that

85
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,569
um

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,610
uh

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,890
that united states manufactures on shore

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,290
and that was really important to him

89
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,409
because because

90
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,049
uh

91
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,250
it's important to national security.

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,370
he wants to make sure

93
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,290
that that the important critical technology of our nation is built in the united states

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,330
and that we re-industrialize and get good at manufacturing again

95
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,450
because it's important for jobs.

96
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,409
> > it just seems like common sense, right? > > incredible common sense.

97
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,290
and and that was like literally the first conversation i had with secretary letic um

98
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,970
and he was talking about how

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:21,930
how

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,490
um

101
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,850
that he started

102
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,210
he started our conversation with uh jensen.

103
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,330
this is secretary lutnik

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,250
and i i just want to let you know that you're a national treasure.

105
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,370
uh

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,410
nvidia

107
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,930
is a national treasure and whenever you need access to the president

108
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,130
um

109
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,610
the administration

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:44,889
uh

111
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:45,530
you call us.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,530
we're always going to be available to you.

113
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,610
literally, that was the first sentence.

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,050
> > that's pretty nice.

115
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,810
> > and it was completely true.

116
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,490
every single time i called, if i needed something, i want to get something off my chest, um, express some concern,

117
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,210
uh,

118
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,650
they're always available. incredible.

119
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,169
it's just unfortunate we live in such a politically polarized society

120
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,930
that you can't recognize good common sense things if they're coming from a person that you object to.

121
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,090
and that, i think, is what's going on here.

122
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,610
i think most people generally a as a country, you know,

123
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,330
as a a giant community, which we are,

124
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,729
it just only makes sense that we have manufacturing in america that especially critical technology like you're talking about.

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,410
like it's kind of insane that we buy so much technology from other countries.

126
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,250
> > if united states doesn't grow, we will have no prosperity.

127
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,009
we can't invest in anything domestically or otherwise.

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,490
we can't fix any of our problems.

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,289
if we don't have energy growth, we can't have industrial growth.

130
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,729
if we don't have industrial growth, we can't have job growth. these

131
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,289
it's as simple as that, > > right? > >

132
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:57,770
and the fact that the fact that he came into office

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,169
and the first thing that he said was drill baby drill.

134
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,250
his point is we need energy growth.

135
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,449
without energy growth, we can have no industrial growth. and that was it saved

136
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,050
it saved the ai industry.

137
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:09,850
got

138
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,889
i got to tell you flat

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,210
out

140
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,449
if not for his progrowth energy policy

141
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,970
we would not be able to build factories for ai

142
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,729
not be able to build chip factories

143
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,330
we won't sure surely won't be able to build supercomputer factories

144
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,289
none of that stuff would be possible without all of that

145
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:28,889
construction

146
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,330
jobs would be challenged

147
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:30,970
right

148
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:31,289
electrical

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,090
you know

150
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,250
electrician

151
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:32,729
jobs

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,690
all of these jobs that are now flourishing would be challenged

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,449
and so i think he's got it right

154
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,970
we need energy growth

155
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,210
we want to re-industrialize the united states.

156
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,729
we need to be back in manufacturing.

157
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,090
every successful person doesn't need to have a phd.

158
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,690
every successful person doesn't have to have gone to stanford or mit.

159
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,690
and i think i think that that that you know that sensibility is is um spot on.

160
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,930
now, when we're talking about technology growth and energy growth,

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,690
there's a lot of people that go, " oh, no.

162
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,729
that's not what we need.

163
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:05,370
we need to, you know, simplify our lives and get back.

164
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,970
" but the the real issue is that we're in the middle of a giant technology race.

165
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,810
and whether people are aware of it or not, whether they like it or not,

166
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,889
it's happening. and it's a really important race

167
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:26,970
because whoever gets to whatever the event horizon of artificial intelligence is, whoever gets there first has massive advantages in a huge way.

168
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,050
do you agree with

169
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,610
that? well, first the part i i will say that we are in a technology race

170
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,690
and we are always in a technology race.

171
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,569
we've been in a technology race with somebody forever.

172
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,770
> > right. > > right. since the industrial revolution, we've been in a technology

173
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,569

174
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,130
even going back to the discovery of energy, right?

175
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,370
the united kingdom was where the industrial revolution was, if you will, invented

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,330
when they realized that they can turn steam and such into into energy into electricity.

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,009
all of that was invented largely in europe and the united states capitalized on it.

178
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,330
we were the ones that learned from it.

179
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,090
we industrialized it.

180
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,210
we diffused it faster than anybody in europe.

181
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:23,690
they were all stuck in discussions about policy and jobs and disruptions.

182
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,009
meanwhile, the united states was forming.

183
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,849
we just took the technology and ran with it.

184
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,770
and so i i think we were always in in a bit of a technology race.

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,610
world war ii was a technology race.

186
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,010
manhattan project was a technology race.

187
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,130
we've been in the technology race ever since during the cold war.

188
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,049
i think we're still in a technology race.

189
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,930
it is probably the single most important race. it is the technology is

190
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,050
uh

191
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,529
it gives you superpowers. you know whether it's information

192
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,529
superpowers or energy

193
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,610
superpowers or military superpowers is all founded in technology

194
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,850
and so technology leadership is really important

195
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,490
> > well

196
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,890
the problem is if somebody else has superior technology

197
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:03,529
right

198
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,649
that's that's the issue

199
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,130
it seems like with the ai race

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,769
people are very nervous about it

201
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,890
like you know

202
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,810
elon has famously said there was like 80 % chance it's awesome

203
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,290
20 % chance we're in trouble and people are worried about that

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,610
20

205
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:19,610

206
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,010
%

207
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,410
rightly

208
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:20,810
so.

209
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,850
i mean that you know if you had 10 bullets in a a a revolver

210
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,330
and you know you

211
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,930
you took out eight of them

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,209
and you still have tw two in there and you spin it, you're not going to feel real comfortable

213
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:34,010
when you pull that trigger.

214
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,130
it's terrifying, > > right? > > and when we're working towards this ultimate goal

215
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,170
um

216
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,089
of ai, it it just it's impossible to imagine

217
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,970
that it wouldn't be of national security interest to get there first.

218
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,250
we should

219
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,250
the question is what's there? that's the

220
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,769
that was the part that > > what is there? > > yeah.

221
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:54,410

226
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,610
i i think it's probably going to be much more gradual than we think. it won't

227
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,089
it won't be a moment. it won't be

228
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,050
it won't be as if um somebody arrived and nobody else has.

229
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,410
i don't think it's going to be like that.

230
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,170
i think it's going to be things that just get better and better and better and better

231
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,209
just like technology does.

> > so, you are rosy about the future. you're

uh

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,410
h

238
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,810
if history is a guide, um

239
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:37,529
uh

240
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,769
we were always concerned about new technology.

241
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,050
humanity has always been concerned about new technology. there are always somebody who's thinking

242
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,170
there always a lot of people who are quite concerned. were quite concerned

243
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,130
and and and so

244
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:51,769
if

245
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,370
if history is a guide,

246
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,970
it is the case

247
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,329
um

248
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,370
that all of this concern is channeled into making the technology safer. and so for example,

249
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:12,250
in the last several years, i would say ai technology has increased probably in the last two years alone,

250
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:13,690
maybe a 100x.

251
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,490
let's just give it a number, okay? it's like a car two years ago was 100 times slower.

252
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,050
so ai is 100 times more capable today.

253
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,170
now, how did we channel

254
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,170
that technology? how do we channel all of that power? we directed it to um

255
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,329
causing the ai to be able to think, meaning that it can take a problem that we give it,

256
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,610
break it down step by step. it does research before it answers.

257
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,850
and so it grounds it on truth.

258
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,810
it'll reflect on that answer.

259
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,690
ask itself, is this the best, you know, answer that i can give you.

260
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,209
am i certain about this answer? if it's not certain about the answer

261
00:11:57,219 --> 00:11:59,690
or highly confident about the answer, it'll go back

262
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,329
and do more research.

263
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,810
it might actually even use a tool

264
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,050
because that tool provides a better solution than it could hallucinate itself.

265
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,329
as a result, we took all of that computing capability

266
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,010
and we channeled it into having it produce a safer result, safer answer,

267
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,690
a more truthful answer

268
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,889
because as you know,

269
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,930
one of the greatest criticisms of ai in the beginning was that it hallucinated,

270
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,690
> > right? > >

271
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,769
and so if you look at the reason why people use ai so much today is

272
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,730
because the amount of hallucination

273
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,810
has reduced. you know,

274
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,370
i use it almost

275
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,690
i

276
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,170
well

277
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,850
i used it the whole trip over here

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,610
and so so i think

279
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:35,690
the

280
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,370
the

281
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:37,930
uh

282
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,089
the

283
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,209
the capability

284
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,050
most people think about power

285
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,610
and they think about

286
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,649
you know

287
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,010
maybe as an explosion power

288
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,930
but the technology power

289
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,170
most of it is channeled to towards safety.

290
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,529
a car today is more powerful but it's safer to drive.

291
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,810
a lot of that power goes towards better handling.

292
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,889
you know, i'd rather have a

293
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:00,329
well,

294
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,649
you have a 1000 horsepower truck.

295
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,370
i think 500 horsepower is pretty good.

296
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,810
no, i thousand's better.

297
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,930
i think a th00and is better.

298
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,490
> > i don't know if it's better, but it's definitely faster. > > yeah.

299
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,450
no, i think it's better.

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:21,529
you can get out of trouble faster. um, i enjoyed my 599 more than my 612. it was

301
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,329
i think it was a better

302
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:22,649
better

303
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,329
horsepower is better. my 459 is better than my 430.

304
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,250
more horsepower is better. i i think more horsepower is better. i think it's better handling. it's better control.

305
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,610
in the case of

306
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,290
in the case of technology, it's also very similar in that way, you know.

307
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:37,850
and so if you

308
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:51,370
if you look at what we're going to do with the next thousand times of performance in ai, a lot of it is going to be channeled towards more reflection, more research, thinking about the answer more deeply.

309
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,170
so when you're defining safety, you're defining a it as accuracy, > > functionality.

310
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,250
> > functionality. okay. > > it

311
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,209
it does what you expect it to do.

312
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,529
and then you take all the the the technology in the horsepower, you put guard rails on it, just like our cars.

313
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,010
we've got a lot of technology in in a car today.

314
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,130
a lot of it is goes towards, for example, abs.

315
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,850
abs is great. and so, uh, traction control, that's fantastic.

316
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,930

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,250
> >

318
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,250
and

319
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,089
that little computer, the computers

320
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,889
that you have doing your traction control is more powerful than the computer that went to apollo 11.

321
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,050
and so you want that technology, channel it towards safety, channel it towards functionality.

322
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,089
and so

323
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:42,250
when people talk about power, the advancement of technology, often times i i i feel what they're thinking

324
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,130
and what we're actually doing is very different.

325
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,850
> > well, what do you think they're thinking? well, they're thinking somehow that this

326
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:50,329
this

327
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:50,889
uh

328
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:57,050
this ai is being powerful and their their mind probably goes towards a sci-fi movie.

329
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,250
the definition of power, you know,

330
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,850
often times the definition definition of power is military power or physical power.

331
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,930
but in in the case of technology

332
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,570
power

333
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,810
when we translate all of those operations

334
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,610
it's towards more refined thinking

335
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,730
you know

336
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,370
more reflection

337
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,730
more planning

338
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,010
more options

339
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,490
> > i think the big fears that people have is one

340
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,490
a big fear is military applications

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,010
that's a big fear

342
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,649

i'm happy that that

348
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,490
uh

349
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,449
our military is going to use ai technology for defense

350
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,529
and i think that that

351
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,250
um

352
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,290

356
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,570
um

357
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,529
all these tech startups now channeling their technology capabilities towards defense and military applications.

358
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,009
i think you needed to do that. > > yeah,

359
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:05,290
we had palmer lucky on the podcast.

360

he was demonstrating some of the stuff i put his helmet on. and we show we

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,649

367
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,449
it's [laughter] awesome.

368
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,449
he's awesome. but it's also

369
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:25,930
it's a

370
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,410
you know

371
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:31,769
an unusual intellect channeled into that very bizarre field is what you need, you

372
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:32,570
and i think it's

373
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:32,810
it's

374
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:33,449
uh

375
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,130
i think i'm happy that we're making it so more socially acceptable.

376
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,769
you know, there was a time where

377
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:47,130
when somebody wanted to channel their technology capability and their intellect into defense technology, uh

378
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,009
somehow they're vilified.

379
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:48,970
um

380
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,690
but

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,250
uh

382
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,130
we need people like that.

383
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,370
we need people who enjoyed enjoy that part of uh application of technology.

384
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,250
> > well, people are terrified of war, you know.

385
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,970

> > that's right.

395
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,089
[laughter] why ask for permission?

396
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:18,569
> > again,

397
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,130
like you said,

398

history.

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,970
go back and look at history.

400
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:21,689
um,

401
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,329
when you look at the future of ai

402
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:24,970
and

403
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:31,289
and you just said that no one really knows what's happening, do you ever sit down and ponder scenarios?

404
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,049
> > like

405
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:33,530
what do you

406
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,010
what do you think is like bestcase scenario for ai over the next two decades?

407
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,330
um

408
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,450
the best case scenario is that ai diffuses into everything that we do

409
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,490
and

410
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:51,929
uh

411
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,370
our

412
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,850
everything's more efficient

413
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,690
but the threat of war remains a threat of war.

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,210
uh,

415
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,490
cyber security remains a super difficult challenge.

416
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,169
somebody is going to try to breach your security.

417
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,610
you're going to have thousands of millions of ai agents protecting you from that threat.

418
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,970
your technology is going to get better.

419
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,890
their technology is going to get better. just like cyber security. right now, while we speak, we're being

420
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,410
we're seeing cyber attacks all over the planet on just about every front door you can imagine.

421
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,289
and and yet you and i are sitting here talking.

422
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,250
and so the reason for that is

423
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,730
because we know that there's a whole bunch of cyber security technology in defense.

424
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,130
and so we just have to keep amping that up, keep stepping that up.

425
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,210
this episode is brought to you by visible.

435
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,570
that's a big issue with people is the the worry that technology is going to get to a point

436
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,169
where encryption is going to be obsolete.

437
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,370
encryption is just it's no longer going to protect data.

438
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,210
it's no longer going to protect systems. do you anticipate that ever being an issue

439
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,250
or do you think there's it's as the defense grows, the threat grows, the defense grows,

440
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,690
and it just keeps going on

441
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,570
and on and on and they'll always be able to fight off any sort of intrusions?

442
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,690
> > not forever.

443
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,330
some intrusion will get in and then that we'll all learn from it.

444
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,370
and you know the reason why cyber security works is

445
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,090
because of course the technology of defense is advancing very quickly.

446
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,650
the technology offense is advancing very quickly.

447
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,210
however, the benefit of the cyber security defense is that socially the community

448
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,490
all of our companies work together as one.

449
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,570
most people don't realize this.

450
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,690
there's a whole community of cyber security experts.

451
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,289
we exchange ideas.

452
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,049
we exchange best practices.

453
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,530
we exchange what we detect. the moment something has been breached or maybe there's a loophole

454
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,650
or whatever it is,

455
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,010
it is shared by everybody. the patches are shared with everybody.

458
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:09,450

no

460
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,169
i had no idea.

461
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,730
i've assumed that it would just be competitive like everything else. > > we work together. interesting.

462
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,289
has that always been the case? > > uh,

463
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,570
it surely has been the case for about about 15 years.

464
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,450
it might not have been the case long ago, but this this > > what do you think started off

465
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,289
that cooperation? > > um,

466
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,970
people recognizing it's a challenge and no company can stand alone.

467
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,010
> > and the same thing is going to happen with ai.

468
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,330
i think we all have to decide work working together

469
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:39,690
uh

470
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,049
to stay out of harm's way is

471
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,570
is our best chance for defense.

472
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,929
then it's basically everybody against the threat.

473
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,690
> > and it also seems like you'd be way better at detecting

474
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,330
where these threats are coming from and neutralizing them.

475
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:52,809

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,690
that's why i'm sitting here right now instead of, you know,

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,210

483
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,610

485
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:16,010
when you think about

486
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:22,169
that cyber threat, > > this idea about cyber security is unknown to the people who are talking about ai threats.

487
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,130
they're

488
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:24,490
i think

489
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,690
when they think about ai threats

490
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,450
and ai cyber security threats, they have to also think about how we deal with it today.

491
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:37,289
now, there's no question that ai is a new technology and it's a new type of software.

492
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,250
in the end, it's software

493
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,850
just it's a new type of software and so it's going to have new capabilities

494
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,450
but so will the defense

495
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,450
you know where you use the same ai technology to go defend against it.

496
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,610
so you do you anticipate a time ever in the future

497
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,809
where it's going to be impossible where there's not going to be any secrets

498
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,250
where the bottleneck between the technology that we have and the information that we have.

499
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,330
information is just all a bunch of ones and zeros.

500
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,250
it's out there on hard drives and the technology has more and more access to that information.

501
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,330
is it ever going to get to a point in time

502
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,809
where there's no way to keep a secret? > > i don't think

503
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:17,690

504
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,169
> > i don't think so.

505
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,090
i think the quantum computers were supposed to

506
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:20,809
will

507
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,130
yeah.

508
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,650
quantum computers will make it possible

509
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,610
will make it so that the previous quantum

510
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,970
previous encryption technology is obsolete.

511
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,250
but that's the reason why the entire industry is working on postquantum encryption technology.

512
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,690
> > what would that look like? > > new algorithms.

513

514
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,450
when you hear about the kind of computation that quantum computing can do.

515
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,770
> > yeah. > > and the the power that it has. yeah.

516

518
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,490
it would take billions of years and it takes them a few minutes to solve these equations.

519
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,530
like how do you make encryption for something

520
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,169
that can do

521
00:23:58,179 --> 00:24:02,890
that? i'm not sure, but there's [laughter] but i've got a bunch of scientists who are working on that.

522
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,409

525
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:16,650

526
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:16,809

529
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,370
i'm

530
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,330
you know,

531
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,529
history is guide.

532
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,490
history is a guide before ai came around.

533
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,730
that's my worry. my worry is this is a totally,

534
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,210
you know,

535
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,970
it's like history was one thing

536
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,490
and then nuclear weapons kind of changed all of our thoughts on war

537
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,490
and mutually assured destruction came everybody to stop using nuclear bombs.

538
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:43,049
> > yeah.

539
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,409
> > my worry is that > >

540
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:47,370
the thing is joe is that that ai is not going to

541
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,650
it's not like we're cavemen

542
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,770
and then all of a sudden one day ai shows up.

543
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,809
every single day we're getting better and smarter because we have ai

544
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,370
and so we're stepping on our own ai's shoulders.

545
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,289
so when when that whatever that ai threat comes, it's a click ahead.

546
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,049
it's not a galaxy ahead, > > you know,

547
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,730
it's just a click ahead. and so so i think i think the

548
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:13,610
the

549
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,970
the idea that somehow this ai is going to pop out of nowhere

550
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,850
and somehow think in a way that we can't even imagine thinking

551
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,730
and do something that we can't possibly imagine i think is far-fetched.

552
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,610
and the reason for that is because we're all have

553
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,650
we all have ais

554
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,770
and you know there's a whole bunch of ais being in development.

555
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,090
we know what they are and we're using it and and so every single day we're getting

556
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,690
we're close to each other.

557
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,730
> > but don't they do things that are very surprising? > > yeah.

558
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,289
but so you you have an ai that does something surprising.

559
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,570
i'm going to have an ai and my ai looks at your ai and goes

560
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,289
that's not that surprising.

561
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:53,850
> >

562
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,210
the fear for the lay person like myself is that ai becomes sentient

563
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,330
and makes its own decisions and then ultimately decides to just govern the world.

564
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,250
do it its own way.

565
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,090
they're like, " you guys, you had a good run, but > > we're taking over now.

566
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,809

567
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:17,289
i mean, [laughter] so that's the

568
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,010
this is the cyber security argument. > > yes.

569
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,529
> > do you have an ai

570
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,409
and it's super smart, but my ai is super smart, too. and and maybe your ai.

571
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,090
let let's pretend

572
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,770
let's let's pretend for a second that we understand what consciousness is

573
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,730
and we understand what sentience is and and that in fact

574
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,770
> > and we really are just pretending.

575
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,130
> > okay, let's just pretend for a second that we we believe that. i don't believe

576
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,450
actually

577
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,490
i don't actually don't believe that

578
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,450
but nonetheless we

579
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,370
let's pretend we believe that. > > so your

580
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:43,529
your

581
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,850
your ai is conscious and my ai is conscious

582
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,049
and and let's say your ai is you know

583
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,409
wants to

584
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,210
i don't know

585
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,770
do something surprising. my ai is so smart that it won't

586
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,730
it might be surprising to me, but it probably won't be surprising to my ai.

587
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,490
and so maybe my ai thinks it's surprising as well,

588
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,330
but it's so smart the moment it sees it the first time, it's not going to be a surprise the second time, just like us.

589
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,650
and so i feel like i think the idea that that only one person has [clears throat] ai

590
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,409
and that one person's ai is compares

591
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,570
everybody else's ai is neanderthal

592
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:24,890
[snorts] is um

593
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,850
probably unlikely.

594
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,650
i think it's much more like cyber security.

595
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,250
> > interesting.

596
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,250
> > i think the fear is not that your ai is going to battle with somebody else's ai.

597
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,450
the fear is that ai is no longer going to listen to you.

598
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,330
that's the fear is that human beings won't have control over it after a certain point

599
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,330
if it achieves sensience and then has the ability to be autonomous

600
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,809
> > that there's one ai.

601
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,850

602
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,529

603
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,010

> > but

605
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,850
that's the there's arguments about

606
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,730
that, right? that we're dealing with some sort of synthetic biology that it's not as simple as new technology

607
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,570
that you're creating a life form.

608
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,690
> > if it's like life form,

609
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,330
let's go along with that for a while. i think if it's like life form,

610
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:11,690
as you know,

611
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,649
all life forms don't agree. and so i'm going to have to go with your life form

612
00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:17,929
and my life form are going to agree

613
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,890
because my life form is going to want to be the super life form.

614
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,450
and and now that now that we have disagreeing life forms, uh

615
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,210
we're back back again to where we are.

616
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,610
well, they would probably cooperate with each other.

617
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,409
it would just the reason why we don't cooperate with each other is we're territorial primates.

618
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,010
but ai wouldn't be a territorial primate.

619
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,570
it would realize the folly in that sort of thinking and it would say, " listen,

620
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,010
there's plenty of energy for everybody. we we don't need to dominate. we don't need

621
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,130
we're not trying to acquire resources and take over the world.

622
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,610
we're not looking to find a good breeding partner.

623
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,450
we're just existing as a new super life form that these cute monkeys created for us.

624
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,809
" okay. well, that would be a

625
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,169
that would be a um

626
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,809
a superpower with no ego, > > right?

627
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:20,330
and and if it has no ego, why would it have the ego to do any harm to us?

628
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,049
> > well, i don't assume that it would do harm to us,

629
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,970
but the the fear would be that we would no longer have control

630
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,130
and that we would no longer be the apex species on the planet.

631
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,529
this thing that we created would now be.

635
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,770
and here's the other thing is like > > if we're racing towards could

636
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,330
yeah.

637
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,010

641
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,490
but you guys are working towards it. um

642
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,210
the

643
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,850
the thing about you're saying about conscience and sensience

644
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,770
that you don't think that ai will achieve consciousness or that the question is

645
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,049
what's the definition? > > yeah.

646
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:13,929
what's the definition of

647
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,649
> > what is the definition to you? > >

648
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:16,649
um

649
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:17,929
uh

650
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:19,529
consciousness

651
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,450
um

652
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,610
uh

653
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:23,850
f

654
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,330
i guess

655
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,890
first of all

656
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,610
uh

657
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,370
you need to know about your own existence. um,

658
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:50,809
you have to have experience, not just knowledge and intelligence. the concept of a machine having an experience.

659
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,210
i'm not well,

660
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,690
first of all,

661
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,049
i don't know what defines experience,

662
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,529
why we have experiences, right? > > yeah.

663
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,970
and why this microphone doesn't uh

664
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:01,850
and so it

665
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,690
i think i know

666
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,570
i

667
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:04,890
well

668
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,450
i think i

669
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:05,690
i

670
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,370
i think i know what consciousness is the sense of experience

671
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,250
the ability to know self versus um

672
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:18,970
uh

673
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,649
the ability to be able to reflect

674
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,809
know our own self

675
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,090
the sense of ego

676
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,010
i think all of all of those human experiences

677
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:29,850
uh

678
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,649
probably is what consciousness is

679
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,929
but why it exists versus the concept of knowledge and intelligence

680
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,330
which is what ai is defined by

681
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,330
today

682
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:44,330
today

683
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,610
it has knowledge

684
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,649
it has intelligence

685
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,490
artificial intelligence

686
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,169
we don't call it artificial consciousness

687
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,250
artificial intelligence

688
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,890
the ability to uh

689
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:09,929
perceive believe, recognize, understand, um, plan, uh, perform tasks. those things are foundations of intelligence

690
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,289
to know things, knowledge.

691
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,610
i don't, it's clearly different than consciousness.

692
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,370
> > but consciousness is so loosely defined. how can we say that?

693
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,690
i mean, doesn't a dog have consciousness? yeah.

694
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,769
> > dogs seem to be pretty conscious. > > that's right.

695
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,090
> > yeah.

696
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,890
so, and that's a lower level consciousness than a human being's consciousness. > > i'm not sure.

697
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:31,929
yeah. right.

698
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,370
well, > > the question is what lower level intelligence? it's lower level intelligence, but i don't know

699
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,409
that it's lower level consciousness.

700
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,289
> > that's a good point.

701
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,210
right. > > because i believe my dogs feel as much as i feel. > > yeah.

702
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,850
they feel a lot. right. > > yeah.

703
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,690
they get attached to you. that's right.

704
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,690
they get depressed if you're not there. > > that's right.

705
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,809
exactly. > > there's

706
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:51,049
there's

707
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,850
definitely that.

708
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,330
> > yeah.

709
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:52,970
um

710
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,649
the the concept of experience, > > right? > > um

711
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,610
but isn't ai interacting with society?

712
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,409
so, doesn't it acquire experience through that interaction? > > um

713
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,730
i don't think interactions is experience. i think experience is

714
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:09,929
uh

715
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,769
experience is a collection of feelings. i think

716
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,090
> > you're aware of that ai

717
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:16,970
um

718
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,769
i forget which one

719
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,769
where they gave it some false information about one of the programmers having an affair with his wife

720
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,370
just to see how it would respond to it

721
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,809
and then when they said they were going to shut it down

722
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,929
it threatened to blackmail him and reveal his affair

723
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,289
and it was like whoa

724
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,169
like it's conniving

725
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,890
like if that's not learning from experience and being aware that you're about to be shut down

726
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,210
which would imply at least some kind of consciousness

727
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,010
or you could kind defined it as consciousness

728
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,090
if you were very loose with the term

729
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,409
and if you imagine that this is going to exponentially become more powerful.

730
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:51,850
wouldn't

731
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,890
that ultimately lead to a different kind of consciousness

732
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,330
than we're defining from biology? well, first of all, let's just break down what it probably did.

733
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,010
it probably read somewhere.

734
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:10,730
there's probably text that that in these consequences certain people did that.

735
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,449
i could imagine a novel, > > right? > > having those words related.

740
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,690
that it's just a bunch of numbers

741
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,050
that that in the in the collection of numbers that relates to a husband cheating on a wife.

742
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:32,089
um

743
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,369
has subsequently a bunch of numbers that relates to blackmail and such things.

744
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,690
however, whatever the revenge was, > > right? > > and so it has spewed it out.

745
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,810
> > and so it's just like, you know, it

746
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,969
it's just as if i'm asking it to write me a poem in shakespeare. it just whatever the words

747
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,889
are in the world

748
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,810
in in that dimensionality, this dimensionality is all these vectors and in in multi-dimensional space.

749
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,490
these words that were in the prompt that described the affair

750
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:09,849
um

751
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:13,130
subsequently led to one word after another led to

752
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:13,930
um

753
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,410
you know

754
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,290
some revenge and something

755
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,290
but it's not because it had consciousness

756
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,890
or you know

757
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,450
it just spewed out those words generated those words > >

758
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:27,450
i understand what you're saying that patterns that human beings have exhibited both in literature and in real life

759
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,329
> > that's exactly right

760
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,170

761
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,609
one would say, " okay,

762
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,810
well, it couldn't do this two years ago and it couldn't do this four years ago.

763
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:35,849
" like

764
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,970
when we're looking towards the future, like at what point in time

765
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,890
when it can do everything a person does,

766
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,849
what point in time do we decide that it's conscious?

767
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,890
if it absolutely mimics all human thinking and behavior patterns, > > that doesn't make it conscious.

768
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,849
> > it becomes in disccernible.

769
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,210
it's it's aware.

770
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,170
it can communicate with you the exact same way a person can. like is con is consciousness

771
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,570
are we putting too much weight on that concept

772
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,089
because it seems like it's a version of a kind of consciousness.

773
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,010
> > it's a version of imitation.

774
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,130
> > imitation consciousness, right? but if it perfectly imitates it, > > i still think it's a per

775
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,490
it's an example of imitation.

776
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,930
> > so it's like a fake rolex when they 3d print them and make them > > indestruable.

777
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,250
the question is what's the definition consciousness?

778
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,050
> > yeah. > > yeah. > > that's the question.

779
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,369
and i don't think anybody's really clearly defined that.

780
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,329
that's what get

781
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:25,690
where it gets weird and that that's

782
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,609
where the real doomsday people are worried that you are creating a form of consciousness that you can't control.

783
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:41,690
i believe it is possible to create a machine that imitates human intelligence

784
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:57,050
and has the ability to understand information, understand instructions, break the problem down, solve problems, and perform tasks.

785
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,329
i believe that completely. i believe that that

786
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,050
um

787
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,010
we could have a computer that has a vast amount of knowledge.

788
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,730
some of it true, some of it not true.

789
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,010
some of it generated by humans, some of it generated synthetically.

790
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,609
and more and more of knowledge in the world will be generated synthetically going forward. you know,

791
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,170
until now

792
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,609
the knowledge that we've we have are knowledge that we generate

793
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,490
and we propagate

794
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,930
and we send to each other and we amplify it and we add to it and we modify it.

795
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,650
we change it.

796
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,810
in the future, in a couple of years, maybe two

797
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,490
or three years, 90 % of the world's knowledge will likely be generated

798
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,130
by ai.

799
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,050
> > that's crazy. > > i know.

800
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,170
but it's just fine. > > but it's just fine. > > i know.

801
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,930
and the reason for that is this.

802
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:56,810
let me tell you

803
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:56,970
why.

804
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,410
> > okay? > > it's because

805
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,450
um

806
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,170
what difference does it make to me that i am learning from a textbook that was generated

807
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,770
by a bunch of people i didn't know

808
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,290
or written by a book that you know

809
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,410
from somebody i don't know

810
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:13,530
uh

811
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:13,690
to

812
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,050
uh

813
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:20,410
knowledge generated by ai computers that are assimilating all of this and reynthesizing things.

814
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,250
to me, i don't think there's a whole lot of difference. we still have to

815
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,770
we still have to fact check it. we still have to make sure that it's you know

816
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,369
based on fundamental first principles

817
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,010
and we still have to do all of that just like we do today.

818
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,410
> > is this taking into account the kind of ai that exists currently? and do you anticipate that

819
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,930
just like we could have never really believed that ai would be

820
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,250
at

821
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,250
least

822
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,170
a person like myself would never believe ai would be as so ubiquitous and so worth it. it's

823
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,329
it's so powerful today and so important today.

824
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,010
we never thought that 10 years ago.

825
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:52,810
never thought

826
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:01,530
that, > > right? > > you imagine like what are we looking at 10 years from now? > > i i think

827
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,849
that if you reflect back 10 years from now, you would say the same thing

828
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:07,450
that we would have never believed that

829
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,010
> > but > > in a different direction, > > right?

830
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,890
but if you

831
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,609
if you go forward 9 years from now

832
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,089
and then ask yourself what's going to happen 10 years from now, i think it'll be quite gradual.

833
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:20,329
um,

834
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,050
one of the things that elon said that makes me happy is he

835
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,290
he's

836
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,329
he believes that we're going to get to a point where it's not

837
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,369
it's not necessary for people to work

838
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,609
and not meaning that you're going to have no purpose in life, but you will have

839
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,970
in his words

840
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,490
universal high income

841
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,250
because so much revenue is generated

842
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,810
by ai

843
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,369
that it will take away this need for people to do things

844
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:53,690
that they don't really enjoy doing just for money.

845
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,890
and i think a lot of people have a problem with that

846
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,210
because their entire identity

847
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,130
and who how they think of themselves and how they fit in the community is what they do.

848
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,849
like this is mike.

849
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,010
he's an amazing mechanic. go to mike

850
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,130
and mike takes care of things.

851
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,450
but there's going to come a point in time

852
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,410
where ai is going to be able to do all those things much better than than people do.

853
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,730
and people will just be able to receive money.

854
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,490
but then what does mike do? mike is, you know, really loves being the best mechanic around.

855
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,210
you know, what does the guy who, you know, codes,

856
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,490
what does he do

857
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,730
when ai can code infinitely faster with zero errors? like what what happens with all those people?

858
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,329
and that is

859
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,210
where it gets weird.

860
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,250
it's like because we've sort of wrapped our identity as human beings around what we do for a living.

861
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:42,890
> >

862
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,170
you know, when you meet someone, one of the first things you meet somebody at a party, hi

863
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:46,570
joe.

864
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,450
what's your name? mike.

865
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,170
what do you do? mike

866
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,010
and you know mike's like, " oh, i'm a lawyer.

867
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,650
" " oh, what kind of law? " and you have a conversation, you know,

868
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,050
when mike is like, " i get money from the government.

869
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,609
i play video games. " > > gets weird. > > mhm.

870
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,170
> >

871
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,650
and i think

872
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,050
um

873
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,369
the concept sounds great until you take into account human nature.

874
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,730
and human nature is that we like to have puzzles to solve and things to do

875
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:08,970
and

876
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,849
and an identity

877
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,569
that's wrapped around our idea that we're very good at this thing that we do for a living.

878
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,050
> > yeah.

879
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,210
yeah,

880
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:17,609
i think

881
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:17,930
um

882
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,890
let's see, let me start with the more mundane

883
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,010
and i'll work

884
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,130
work backwards, okay? work forward. uh

885
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:26,089
so

886
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,690
one of the predictions from uh

887
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,369
jeff hinton

888
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,970
who who started the whole deep learning phenomenon

889
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,450
the deep learning technology trend

890
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,210
and

891
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:39,690
uh

892
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,530
in incredible incredible researcher

893
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:42,569
uh

894
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:44,329
professor at university of toronto

895
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,170
uh

896
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:46,890
he invented

897
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,210
discovered or invented the the idea of of back propagation

898
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,170
which

899
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,050
which

900
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,530
uh

901
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,369
allows the neural network to learn.

902
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,329
and um

903
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,970
and as

904
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,770
as as you know

905
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:02,329
uh

906
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,369
for for the audience,

907
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,770
software historically was humans

908
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,089
applying first principles and our thinking to

909
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,290
uh

910
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,730
describe an algorithm that is

911
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:16,970
then

912
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:20,970
codified just like a recipe that's codified in software.

913
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:22,890
it looks just like a recipe.

914
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,170
how to cook something looks exactly the same just in a slightly different language. we call it python

915
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,410
or c or c + + or whatever it is.

916
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:41,450
in the case of deep learning, this invention of artificial intelligence, we put a structure of a whole bunch of neural networks

917
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,010
and a whole bunch of math units

918
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,170
and we make this large structure.

919
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:58,170
it's like a switchboard of little u mathematical units and we connect it all together. um,

920
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,609
and we give it the input that the software would eventually receive

921
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,810
and we just let it randomly guess what the output is.

922
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,329
and so we say,

923
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:12,650
for example,

924
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,849
the input could be a picture of a cat.

925
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,569
and and um

926
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,250
one of the outputs of the switchboard is where the cat signal is supposed to show up.

927
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,010
and all of the other signals, the other one's a dog, the other one's an elephant, the other one's a tiger.

928
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,010
and all of the other signals are supposed to be zero when i show it a cat.

929
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,130
and the one that is a cat should be one.

930
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,970
and i show at a cat through this big huge network of switchboards and math units

931
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:54,490
and they're just doing multiply and adds multiplies and ads. okay? and and uh

932
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,569
and this thing, this switchboard is gigantic.

933
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,730
the more information you're going to give it, the more the bigger this switchboard has to be.

934
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,690
and what jeff hinton discovered was a invented was a way for you to guess

935
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,450
that put the cat signal in

936
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,569
put the cat image in

937
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,130
and that cat image you know could be a million numbers

938
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,970
because it's you know

939
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,930
a megapixel image

940
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,329
for example

941
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,609
and it's just a whole

942
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,810
a whole bunch of numbers

943
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:30,170
and somehow from those numbers it has to light up the cat signal. okay, that's the bottom line.

944
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,569
and if it

945
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,250
the first time you do it, it just comes up with garbage.

946
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,410
and so it says the right answer is cat.

947
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,410
and so you need to increase this signal

948
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,650
and decrease all of the other and back propagates the outcome through the entire network.

949
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,890
and then you show another.

950
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,210
now it's an image of a dog

951
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,210
and it guesses it takes a swing at it

952
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,770
and it comes up with a bunch of garbage and you say

953
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:01,930
no

954
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,089
no

955
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:02,329
no

956
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,369
the answer is

957
00:45:03,379 --> 00:45:04,089
this is a dog

958
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,930
i want you to produce dog

959
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,730
and all of the other switch

960
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,970
all the other outputs have to be zero

961
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,770
and i want to back propagate that and just do it over and over and over again.

962
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:16,490
it's just like

963
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:17,290
uh

964
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:18,410
showing a a kid

965
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,490
this is an apple, this is a dog, this is a cat.

966
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,849
and you just keep showing it to them until they eventually get it.

967
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:24,810
okay.

968
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,970
well, anyways, that big invention is deep learning.

969
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,650
that's the foundation of artificial intelligence, a piece of software that learns from examples.

970
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,329
that's basically we machine learning, a machine that learns. uh

971
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,770
and so so one of the the big first applications was image recognition

972
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,170
and one of the most important image recognition applications is radiology. > >

973
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:54,410
and so

974
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,530
so

975
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,010
uh

976
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,050
uh

977
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:57,530
he predicted

978
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:58,650
uh

979
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,849
about 5 years ago that in five years time the world won't need any radiologists

980
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,970
because ai would have swept the whole field.

981
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,970
well, it turns out ai has swept the whole field.

982
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,569
that is completely true.

983
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,609
today, just about every radiologist is using ai in some way.

984
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,290
and what's ironic though, what's what's interesting is that the number of radiologist has actually grown.

985
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,490
and so the question is why?

986
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,530
that's kind of interesting, right? > > it is.

987
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:38,569
and so the prediction was in fact that 30 million radiologists will be wiped out.

988
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,250
but as it turns out, we needed more.

989
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,569
and the reason for that [clears throat and cough] is

990
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,650
because the purpose of a radiologist is to diagnose disease, not to study the image.

991
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,130
this

992
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:59,210
the image studying is simply a task to in service of diagnosing the disease.

993
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,730
and so now the fact that you could study the images more quickly

994
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,210
and more precisely without ever making a mistake and never gets tired.

995
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:17,290
you could study more images. you could study it in 3d form instead of 2d

996
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,010
because you know the ai doesn't care whether it studies images in 3d or 2d.

997
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,609
you could study it in 4d.

998
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,810
and so the now you could study images in a way that radiologist radiologists can't easily do

999
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,569
and you could study a lot more of it.

1000
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,450
and so the number of tests that people are able to do increases and

1001
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,410
because they're able to serve more patients, the hospital does better.

1002
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,890
they have more clients, more patients.

1003
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,890
as a result, they have better economics.

1004
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,450
when they have better economics, they hire more radiologists because their purpose is not to study the images.

1005
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,530
their purpose is to diagnose disease.

1006
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:03,770
and so the question is the what i'm leading up to is ultimately what is the purpose? what is the purpose of the lawyer?

1007
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,849
and has the purpose changed? what is the purpose? you know, one of the examples

1008
00:48:09,859 --> 00:48:10,730
that i gave is is

1009
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,210
um

1010
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:11,849
that i would give

1011
00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:12,010
is

1012
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,369
for example

1013
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:14,490
uh

1014
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,130
if my car became self-driving will all chauffeers be out of jobs?

1015
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,809
the answer probably is not because for some per

1016
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,609
for some chauffeers

1017
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:24,650
they

1018
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,170
for some people who are driving you

1019
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:27,050
they could be protectors

1020
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,250
some people

1021
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,290
um

1022
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,569
they're part of the experience

1023
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,530
part of the service

1024
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,650
so when you get there

1025
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,809
they you know they could take care of things for you

1026
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,369
and so for a lot of different reasons not all chauffeers would lose their jobs

1027
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,450
some chauffeers would lose their jobs

1028
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:42,569
and

1029
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:42,970
uh

1030
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:49,690
many chauffeers would change their jobs and the type of applications of autonomous vehicles will probably increase

1031
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:50,809
you know

1032
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:52,329
the usage of the technology within

1033
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,609
find new homes

1034
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:57,849
and so i i think you have to go back to what is the purpose of a job

1035
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:58,490
you know

1036
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:58,650
like

1037
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:58,970
for example

1038
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,010
if ai comes along

1039
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,089
i actually don't believe i'm going to lose my job because my purpose isn't to

1040
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,809
i have to look at a lot of documents

1041
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,410
i study a lot of emails

1042
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,730
i look at a bunch of diagrams

1043
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,609
you know

1044
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:12,089
um

1045
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,010
the question is what is the job and and

1046
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:16,569
uh

1047
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,369
the purpose of somebody

1048
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,890
probably hasn't changed

1049
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,369
a lawyer

1050
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:19,849
for example

1051
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,010
help people that probably hasn't changed

1052
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,290
studying legal documents

1053
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,569
generating documents

1054
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,250
it's part of the job

1055
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,210
not the job

1056
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,130

1063

factor

1064
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,609
if your job is the task

1065
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,690
> > that's a lot of people > > it could be a lot of people

1066
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,530
but it'll probably generate like for example

1067
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,450
> >

1068
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:45,450
uh

1069
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:45,770
let's say

1070
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:45,930
we

1071
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:46,650
let's say

1072
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,569
i'm super excited about the the the robots elon's working on.

1073
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,890
it's still a few years away. when it happens, when it happens,

1074
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:58,569
um

1075
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:06,890
there's a whole new industry of technicians and people who have to manufacture the robots, right? > > mhm.

1076
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,450
> > and so that that job never existed.

1077
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,650
and so you're going to have a whole industry of people taking care of

1078
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,050
like

1079
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:15,369
for example,

1080
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:16,410
you know,

1081
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:22,809
all the mechanics and all the people who are building things for cars, supercharging cars, uh

1082
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,329
that didn't exist before cars

1083
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:27,369
and now we're going to have robots. you're going to have robot apparel.

1084
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,849
so a whole industry of [laughter] right.

1085
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,490
isn't that right? because i want my robot to look different than your robot.

1086
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,569
> > oh god. > > and so [laughter] you're going to

1087
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,770
you're going to have a whole, you know, apparel industry for robots.

1088
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,730
you're going to have mechanics for robots and you have

1089
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,890
you know people who comes and maintain your robots

1090

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:32,410
um

1108
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,050
yeah,

1109
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,010
both ideas probably won't exist at the same time

1110
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:38,970
and and

1111
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:39,690
um

1112
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,170
as in life, things will probably be in the middle.

1113
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,730
one idea, of course, is that there'll be so much abundance of resource that nobody needs a job

1114
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,849
and we'll all be wealthy.

1115
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,569
on the other hand,

1116
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,010
um

1117
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,089
we're going to need universal basic income.

1118
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,250
both ideas don't exist at the same time, > > right? > >

1119
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,849
and so we're either going to be all wealthy or we're going to be all

1120
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:04,329
> >

1121
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:06,250
how could everybody be wealthy though? but > > because

1122
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:06,730
scenario

1123
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,450
wealthy

1124
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,730
not because you have a lot of dollars, wealthy because there's a lot of abundance.

1125
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:11,770
like

1126
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,089
for example,

1127
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,569
today we are wealthy of information.

1128
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,809
you know, this is some a concept several thousand years ago only a few people have.

1129
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,730
and so, uh, today we have wealth of a whole bunch of things, resources that that historic point.

1130
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:26,970
yeah.

1131
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,609
and so, we're going to have wealth of resources, things

1132
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:35,130
that we think are valuable today that in the future are just not not that valuable, you know,

1133
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:35,609
and so it

1134
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:44,730
because it's automated. and so i think i think the question maybe maybe partly it's hard to answer

1135
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:52,089
partly because it's hard to talk about infinity and it's hard to talk about a long time from now

1136
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:59,770
and and the reason for that is because there's just too many scenarios to to consider.

1137
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:00,650
but i think it

1138
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,369
i think

1139
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:07,290
in the next several years, call it 5 to 10 years, there are several things

1140
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,970
that i i believe in hope.

1141
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,530
um, and i say hope

1142
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:12,410
because i'm not sure.

1143
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:19,210
one of the things that i believe is that the technology divide will be substantially collapsed.

1144
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:30,809
and of course the alternative viewpoint is that ai is going to increase the technology divide.

1145
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,930
now the reason why i believe ai is going to reduce the technology divide.

1146
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,890
i is because we have proof

1147
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,490
the evidence is that ai is the easiest application in the world to use.

1148
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,010
chat gpt has grown to almost a billion users frankly practically overnight.

1149
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,890
and if you're not exactly sure how to use,

1150
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,170
everybody knows how to use chatpt.

1151
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,210
just say something to it. if you're not sure how to use chatpt,

1152
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,450
you ask chatd how to use it.

1153
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,250
no tool in history has ever had this capability. a quez an art,

1154
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:06,890
you know,

1155
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,329
if you don't know how to use it, you're kind of screwed.

1156
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,089
you're going to walk up to it

1157
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:12,490
and say, " how do you use a quezin art? " you're going to have to find somebody else.

1158
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,329
and so, but an ai will just tell you exactly how to do it.

1159
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,609
anybody could do this.

1160
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,130
it'll speak to you in any language.

1161
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,290
and if it doesn't know your language, you'll speak it in that language

1162
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,730
and it'll probably figure out that it doesn't completely understand your language.

1163
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,170
go learns it instantly and comes back and talk to you.

1164
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,650
and so i think the the technology divide has a real chance finally

1165
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,569
that you don't have to speak python

1166
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,050
or c + + or forran.

1167
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,650
you can just speak human and whatever form of human you like.

1168
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,890
and so i think that that has a real chance of closing the technology divine.

1169
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:58,569
now, of course, the counternarrative would say that ai is only going to be available for the nations

1170
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,450
and the countries that have a vast amount of resources

1171
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,130
because ai takes energy

1172
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:10,410
and ai takes um a lot of gpus and factories to be able to produce the ai.

1173
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,329
no doubt at the scale that we would like to do in the united states.

1174
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,770
but the fact of the matter is your phone's going to run ai just fine all

1175
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:21,770
by itself, you know,

1176
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,410
in a few years.

1177
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,170
today, it already does it fairly decently.

1178
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,809
and so the the the fact

1179
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:34,170
that every every country, every nation, every every society will have the benefit of very good ai.

1180
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,930
it might not be tomorrow's ai.

1181
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,290
it might be yesterday's ai,

1182
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,930
but yesterday's ai is freaking amazing.

1183
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,170
you know, in 10 years time, 9year-old ai is going to be amazing.

1184
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,170
you don't need, you know, 10 year old ai. you don't need frontier ai

1185
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,369
like we need frontier ai because we want to be the world leader.

1186
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:57,369
but for every single country, everybody, i think the ele the capability to elevate everybody's knowledge

1187
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,010
and capability and intelligence, uh,

1188
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,730
that day is coming.

1189
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,049
the octagon isn't just in las vegas anymore.

1190
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:08,410
it's right in your hands with draftkings sportsbook, the official sports betting partner of ufc.

1191
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:09,609
get ready

1192
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:09,930
because

1193
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,130
when dwabish willie

1194
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:21,210
and yan face off again at ufc 323, every punch, every takedown, every finish, it all has the potential to pay off in real time.

1195
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,210
new customers bet just $ 5. and if your bet wins, you get paid $ 200 in bonus bets.

1196

1197
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,730
draftkings sportsbook is now live in the show me state.

1199
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,970
that's code rogan to turn five bucks into 200 in bonus bets if your bet wins.

1216
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,290
and so if you take a look at

1217
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,410
um

1218
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,250
one of the most important technology advances in history is this idea called moore's law.

1219
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,569
moore's law was the started basically in my generation

1220
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,329
and my generation is the generation of computers.

1221
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:55,130
i graduated in 1984

1222
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:04,490
and that was basically at the very beginning of the pc revolution. and the microprocessor and and um

1223
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,890
every single year it approximately doubled

1224
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,609
and we describe it as every single year we double the performance.

1225
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:19,049
but what it really means is that every single year the cost of computing halfed.

1226
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:27,849
and so the cost of computing in the course of five years reduced by a factor of 10.

1227
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,569
the amount of energy necessary to do computing to do any task

1228
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:34,089
reduced by a factor of 10.

1229
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,930
every single 10 years

1230
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,730
100 a th00and

1231
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:39,930
10,

1232
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:39,930
000

1233
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,609
100, 000 so on

1234
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:44,170
and so forth.

1235
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,890
and so each one of the clicks of moore's law,

1236
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:54,170
the amount of energy necessary to do any computing reduced. that's the reason why you have a laptop today

1237
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,369
when back in 1984 sat on the desk, you got to plug in,

1238
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:00,250
it wasn't that fast

1239
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,930
and it consumed a lot of power. today,

1240
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:02,809
you know,

1241
00:59:02,819 --> 00:59:03,849
it is only a few watts.

1242
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,170
and so moore's law is the fundamental technology, the fundamental technology trend that made it possible.

1243
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:13,849
well, what's going on in ai? the reason why nvidia is here is

1244
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,329
because in we invented this new way of doing computing.

1245
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,609
we call it accelerated computing.

1246
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:24,890
we started it 33 years ago. took us about 30 years to really made a huge breakthrough. in that

1247
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:28,490
in that 30 years or so we took computing

1248
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,010
you know

1249
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,690
probably a factor of

1250
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:32,089
well

1251
00:59:32,099 --> 00:59:32,569
let me just say

1252
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:33,609
in last 10 years

1253
00:59:33,619 --> 00:59:34,490
the last 10 years

1254
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,650
we improved the performance of computing by 100, 000 times.

1255
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,010
whoa.

1256
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,410
imagine a car over the course of 10 years that became a 100, 000 times faster

1257
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,890
or at the same speed

1258
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:51,290
100, 000 times cheaper

1259
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,690
or at the same speed

1260
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,770
100, 000 times less energy.

1261
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,530
if your car did that, it doesn't need energy at all.

1262
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,650
what i mean what what i'm trying to say is that in 10 years time

1263
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,490
the amount of energy necessary for artificial intelligence for most people will be minuscule

1264
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,730
utterly minuscule

1265
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:17,130
and so we'll have ai running in all kinds of things and all the time

1266
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:22,010
because it doesn't consume that much energy and so if you're a nation that uses ai

1267
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:22,410
for

1268
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,690
you know almost everything in your social fabric

1269
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,530
of course you're going to need these ai factories

1270
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,290
but for a lot of countries

1271
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:30,329
i think you're going

1272
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,770
you're going to have excellent ai and you're not going to need as much energy.

1273
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,369
everybody will be able to come along

1274
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,250
is my point.

1275
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,690
> > so currently that that is a big bottleneck, right? is energy.

1276
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,290
> > yeah, it is the bottleneck.

1277
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,970
> > the bottleneck is this.

1278
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:43,930
so was it google

1279
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:50,970
that is making nuclear power plants to operate one of its ai factories? > > oh, i haven't heard

1280
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,210
that.

1281
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:56,170
but i think in the next six, seven years, i think you're going to see a whole bunch of small nuclear reactors.

1282
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,010
> > and by small,

1283
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,170
like how big are you talking about? hundreds of megawws.

1284
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:00,809
yeah.

1285
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:06,890
> > okay. and that these will be local to whatever specific company they have. > > that's right.

1286
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,010
will all be power generators. > > whoa. > > you know,

1287
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:10,329
just like

1288
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,130
just like your

1289
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:12,569
you know,

1290
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,450
somebody's farm.

1291
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,650
> > it probably is the smartest way to do it, right? > >

1292
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:17,530
and it takes the burden off

1293
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:17,849
yeah.

1294
01:01:17,859 --> 01:01:21,849
takes the burden off the grid. it takes and you could build as much as you need

1295
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,170
> > and you can contribute back to the grid.

1296
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:29,849
it's a really important point that i think you just made about moore's law and the relationship to pricing

1297
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,089
because you know a laptop today

1298
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,089
like you can get one of those little mac macbook airs.

1299
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,290
they're incredible. they're so thin, unbelievably powerful. battery life is charge it. > > yeah.

1300
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,849
battery [laughter] life's crazy. and uh

1301
01:01:41,859 --> 01:01:42,809
it's not that expensive

1302
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,010
relatively speaking.

1303
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,770
like something like that. > > i remember.

1304
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,490
> > and that's just moore's law, right? > > then there's the nvidia law.

1305
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,250
> > oh, > > just right.

1306
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,730
the the the law i was talking to you about, the computing

1307
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,049
that we invented, > > right? > >

1308
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:58,250
the reason why we're here, this new this new way of doing computing

1309
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:05,130
> > is like mo's law on energy drinks. i mean, it's [laughter] it's like mo's law

1310
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:07,849
it's

1311
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:08,170
it's like

1312
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:08,569
yeah.

1313
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,849
moore's law and joe rogan.

1314
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:10,890
> > wow.

1315
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,329
that's interesting. > > yeah.

1316
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,210
that's us.

1317
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:14,809
> > so, explain that. um

1318
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:15,530
this

1319
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,809
this chip that you brought to elon,

1320
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:17,530
what

1321
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,049
what's the significance of this? it's like

1322
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:20,089
why is it so superior?

1323
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,569
and so in 2012, jeff hinton's lab,

1324
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,650
this gentleman i was talking talking about,

1325
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:29,849
um

1326
01:02:29,859 --> 01:02:30,410
ilas suscober,

1327
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,210
alex kresevski, um

1328
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:45,450
they made a breakthrough in computer vision in literally creating a piece of software called alexnet.

1329
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:53,849
and its job was to recognize images. and it recognized images at a c

1330
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:54,410
at a level

1331
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,130
computer vision which is fundamental to intelligence. if you can't perceive, you can't

1332
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,089
it's hard to have intelligence.

1333
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:05,130
and so computer vision is a fundamental pillar of not the only but fundamental pillar of.

1334
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,569
and so breaking computer vision

1335
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,089
or breaking through in computer vision is pretty foundational to almost everything that everybody wants to do in ai.

1336
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:18,650
and so in 2012, their lab in toronto

1337
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:20,890
uh

1338
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:21,530
made

1339
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:21,849
this

1340
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,609
made this breakthrough called alexnet.

1341
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,170
and alexet was able to recognize images so much better

1342
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,890
than any human created computer vision algorithm in the 30 years prior.

1343
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,089
so all of these people, all these scientists

1344
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,490
and we had many too working on computer vision algorithms

1345
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:50,010
and these two kids, ilia and alex under the the

1346
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:50,569
uh

1347
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,569
under under

1348
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:53,049
uh

1349
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:59,450
jeff hinton took a giant leap above it and it was based on this thing called alexet

1350
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:00,650
this neural network.

1351
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:08,410
and the way it ran, the way they they made it work was literally buying two nvidia graphics cards

1352
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,770
because nvidia nvidia's gpus

1353
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,809
we've been working on this new way of doing computing and our gpus application

1354
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:29,770
and it's basically a supercomputing application to back in 1984 in order to process computer games

1355
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:35,210
and what you have in your racing simulator that is called an image generator

1356
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,849
supercomputer. and so nvidia started our first application was computer graphics

1357
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:48,490
and we applied this new way of doing computing where we do things in parallel in instead of sequentially.

1358
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,049
a cpu does things sequentially. step one, step two, step three.

1359
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,410
in our case, we break the problem down and we give it to thousands of processors.

1360
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:07,369
and so our way of doing computation is much more complicated.

1361
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:15,690
but if you're able to formulate the problem in the way that we created called cuda,

1362
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,450
this is the invention of our company.

1363
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,849
if you could formulate it in that way, we could process everything simultaneously.

1364
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,970
now, in the case of computer graphics, it's easier to do

1365
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,250
because every single pixel on your screen is not related to every other pixel.

1366
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,970
and so, i could render multiple parts of the screen at the same time.

1367
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,250
not not completely true because, you know,

1368
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:45,210
maybe maybe the way lighting works or the way shadow works, there's a lot of dependency and and such.

1369
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:47,690
but computer graphics

1370
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:48,890
with all the dis

1371
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,450
with all the pixels, i should be able to process everything simultaneously.

1372
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:57,690
and so we we took this embarrassingly parallel problem called computer graphics

1373
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,890
and we applied it to this new way of doing computing.

1374
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,450
nvidia's nvidia's accelerated computing.

1375
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:10,329
we put it in all of our graphics cards. kids were buying it to play games.

1376
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:11,369
we're

1377
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:15,530
you probably don't know this, but we're the largest gaming platform in the world today.

1378
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,410
> > oh, i know that.

1379
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:16,890
oh, > > okay.

1380
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,089
> > i used to make my own computers.

1381
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,730
i used to buy your graphics cards. > > oh, that's super cool.

1382
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,049
> > yeah.

1383
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:23,690
[laughter] set up sli with two graphics cards. > > yeah,

1384
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,970
i love it. okay, that's super cool.

1385
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:25,530
> > oh, yeah, man.

1386
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,690
i used to be a quake junkie. > > oh, that's cool.

1387
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:28,089
> > yeah.

1388
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,210
> > okay, so sli, i'll tell you the story in just a second

1389
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:32,970
and how it led to elon.

1390
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,490
i'm still answering the question.

1391
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:36,170
and so, anyways,

1392
01:06:36,319 --> 01:06:42,170
these these two kids trained this model using the technique i described earlier on our gpus

1393
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,130
because our gpus could process things in parallel.

1394
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,650
it's essentially a supercomput in a pc.

1395
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:55,130
the reason why you used it for quake is because it is the first consumer supercomputer.

1396
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,250
okay.

1397
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:00,010
and so anyways, they made that breakthrough.

1398
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:02,650
we were working on computer vision at the time.

1399
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,890
it caught my attention and so we went to learn about it.

1400
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,210
simultaneously this deep learning phenomenon was happening all over all over the country.

1401
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:17,369
universities after another recognized the importance of deep learning

1402
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:23,210
and all of this work was happening at stanford, at harvard, at berkeley, just all over the place.

1403
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,170
new york university, l yan lakun, andrew yang at stanford, so many different places.

1404
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:37,690
and i see it cropping up everywhere. and so my curiosity asked,

1405
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,410
you know,

1406
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:41,530
what is so special about this form of machine learning?

1407
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,849
and we've known about machine learning for a very long time.

1408
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:45,609
we've known about ai for a very long time.

1409
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:50,650
we've known about neural networks for a very long time. what makes now the moment?

1410
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:52,010
and so we realized

1411
01:07:52,880 --> 01:08:00,809
that this architecture for deep neural networks back propagation the way deep neuronet networks were created.

1412
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,970
we could probably scale this problem, scale the solution to solve many problems.

1413
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,650
that is essentially a universal function approximator.

1414
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,609
okay? meaning meaning you know

1415
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:17,290
back when you're in in in school

1416
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:18,488
you have a

1417
01:08:18,499 --> 01:08:19,049
you have a

1418
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:21,770
you have a box inside of it is a function

1419
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:22,649
you give it an input

1420
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:23,529
it gives you an output

1421
01:08:24,158 --> 01:08:25,448
and and the

1422
01:08:25,459 --> 01:08:27,609
the reason why i call it universal function approximator

1423
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,330
is that this computer

1424
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:32,729
instead of you describing the function

1425
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,609
a function could be a new equation

1426
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:35,929
fals

1427
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:36,408
ma

1428
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:37,370
that's a function

1429
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,689
you write the function in software

1430
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,448
you give it input

1431
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:45,370
f mass acceleration, it'll tell you the force.

1432
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:51,049
okay? and the way this computer works is really interesting.

1433
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,488
you give it a universal function.

1434
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,210
it's not fals, just a universal function. it's a big huge deep neural network

1435
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:08,089
and instead of describing the inside, you give it examples of input and output

1436
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:09,689
and it figures out the inside.

1437
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,770
so you give it input and output and it figures out the inside.

1438
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,929
a universal function approximator.

1439
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,330
today it could be newton's equation.

1440
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:24,890
tomorrow it could be maxwell's equation. it could be kulum's law. it could be thermodynamics equation. it could be

1441
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,609
you know shingers's equation for quantum physics. and so you could put any

1442
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,890
you could have this

1443
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,330
describe almost anything

1444
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,370
so long as you have the input and the output.

1445
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,689
so long as you have the input and the output

1446
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,929
or it could learn the input and output.

1447
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,529
> > and so we took a step back and we said, " hang on a second.

1448
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,130
this isn't just for computer vision.

1449
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,370
deep learning could solve any problem.

1450
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,170
all the problems that are interesting so long as we have input and output.

1451
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,530
now what has input and output? well, the world.

1452
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,530
the world has input and output.

1453
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,449
and so we could have a computer that could learn almost anything. machine learning, artificial intelligence.

1454
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,810
and so we reasoned that maybe this is the fundamental breakthrough that we needed.

1455
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:16,010
there were a couple of things that had to be solved.

1456
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,850
for example, we had to believe that you could actually scale this up to giant systems.

1457
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:28,250
it was running in a they had two graphics cards, two gtx 580s, [laughter] which

1458
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,730
by the way is exactly your sli configuration.

1459
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:31,370
yeah.

1460
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:31,610
okay.

1461
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:41,210
so, that gtx 5880 sli was the revolutionary computer that put deep learning on the map.

1462
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:41,690
> > wow.

1463
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,730
> > it was 2018 and you were using it to play quake.

1464
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,690
> > wow. that's crazy. > > that was the moment.

1465
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,170
that was the big bang of modern ai.

1466
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:57,449
we were lucky because we were inventing this technology, this computing approach. we were lucky that they found it.

1467
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,810
turns out they were gamers and it was lucky they found it. and it

1468
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:05,690
it was lucky that we paid attention to that moment.

1469
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,489
it was a little bit like, you know,

1470
01:11:08,499 --> 01:11:10,890
that star trek,

1471
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,290
you know,

1472
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:13,929
first contact.

1473
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,170
the vulcans had to have seen the warp drive at that very moment.

1474
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:23,610
if they didn't witness the warp drive, you know,

1475
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,929
they would have never come to earth and everything would have never happened.

1476
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,530
it's a little bit like if i hadn't paid attention to that moment, that flash.

1477
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,370
and that flash didn't last long.

1478
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,449
if i hadn't paid attention to that flash

1479
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:40,810
or our company didn't pay attention to it, who knows what would have happened, but we saw that

1480
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,050
and we reasoned our way into this is a

1481
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,730
this is a universal function approximator.

1482
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:46,969
this is not just a computer vision approximator.

1483
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,370
we could use this for all kinds of things.

1484
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,929
if we could solve two problems. the first problem is that we have to prove to oursel

1485
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:54,570
it could scale.

1486
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:02,250
the second problem we had to wait for

1487
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:02,730
i guess

1488
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,050
contribute to and wait for

1489
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:13,210
is the world will never have enough data on input and output

1490
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,330
where we could supervise the ai to learn everything.

1491
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,890
for example, if we have to supervise our children on everything they learn,

1492
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,770
the amount of information they could learn is limited.

1493
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,610
we needed the ai, we needed the computer to have a method of learning without supervision.

1494
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:40,409
and that's where we had to wait a few more years, but un unsupervised ai learning is now here.

1495
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,170
and so the ai could learn by itself.

1496
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,929
and and the reason why the ai could learn by itself is

1497
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:49,449
because we have many examples of right answers.

1498
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:49,929
like

1499
01:12:49,939 --> 01:12:50,250
for example,

1500
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,650
if i want to learn

1501
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:53,370
uh

1502
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,170
if i want to teach an ai how to predict the next word,

1503
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,409
i could just grab it, grab a whole bunch of text we already have, mask out the last word

1504
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:03,690
and make it

1505
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,250
try and try and try again until it predicts the next one.

1506
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,850
or i mask out random words inside inside the text and i make it try and try and try

1507
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:12,810
until it predicts it.

1508
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,370
you know, like

1509
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:14,170
uh

1510
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,290
mary

1511
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:16,489
uh

1512
01:13:16,499 --> 01:13:17,929
mary goes down to the bank.

1513
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,449
is it a river bank or a money bank?

1514
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,489
well, if you're going to go down to the bank, it's probably a river bank. okay. so, and it

1515
01:13:26,499 --> 01:13:26,730
it

1516
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:34,409
it might not be obvious even from that. it might need and uh and uh

1517
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:40,010
and caught a fish. okay. now you know it's must be the riverbank. and so so you give

1518
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,170
you give these ais a whole bunch of these examples

1519
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,130
and you mask out the words, it'll predict the next one.

1520
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,250
okay? and so unsupervised learning came along.

1521
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,010
these two ideas, the fact that it's scalable and unsupervised learning came along.

1522
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:59,449
we were convinced that we ought to put everything into this and help create this industry

1523
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,090
because we're going to solve a whole bunch of interesting problems.

1524
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,690
and that was in 2012.

1525
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,130
by 2016, i had

1526
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,449
i had built this computer called the dgx1.

1527
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,010
the one that you saw me give to elon is called dgx spark.

1528
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:23,530
the dgx1 was $ 300, 000. it cost nvidia a few billion dollars to make the first one.

1529
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,610
and instead of two chips

1530
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,010
sli,

1531
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,850
we connected eight chips with a technology called mvlink,

1532
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,250
but it's basically sli supercharged.

1533
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,210
okay. > > okay. > >

1534
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,409
and so we connected eight of these chips together instead of just two.

1535
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,650
and all of them work together

1536
01:14:45,199 --> 01:14:49,929
just like your quake rig did to solve this deep learning problem

1537
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,890
to train this model. and so i create

1538
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:59,210
we created this thing. i announced it at gtc and at one of our annual annual events

1539
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:06,170
and i described this deep learning thing, computer vision thing and this computer called djx1.

1540
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,610
the audience was like completely silent. they had no idea what i was talking about.

1541
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:17,449
[laughter] and i was lucky because i i had known elon

1542
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:18,330
and

1543
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:18,810
uh

1544
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:19,530
uh

1545
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:22,650
i helped him build the first computer for model 3

1546
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,170
uh

1547
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:24,730
uh

1548
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,370
the model s.

1549
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:26,409
and

1550
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:26,810
uh

1551
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:26,969
and

1552
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:31,449
when he wanted to start working on autonomous vehicle, i helped him build the computer

1553
01:15:31,459 --> 01:15:37,210
that went into the the model s av system, his full full self-driving system.

1554
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:46,250
we were basically the fsd computer version one. and so we we're already working together

1555
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:47,050
and

1556
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:47,610
um

1557
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,530
when i announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it.

1558
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,730
i had no purchase orders.

1559
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:58,250
not not one. nobody wanted to buy it. nobody wanted to be part of it except for elon.

1560
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:58,810
he goes,

1561
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:05,370
he was at the event and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars.

1562
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:07,770
i think it's like 2016.

1563
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:08,810
yeah, 20

1564
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,690
maybe at that time

1565
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,170
it was 2015.

1566
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:16,570
and he goes, " you know what? i have a company that could really use this.

1567
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,530
" i said, " wow, my first customer.

1568
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:24,010
" and so, so i was pretty excited about it. and he goes, " uh,

1569
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:24,969
yeah.

1570
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,170
uh,

1571
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:33,690
we have this company. it's a nonprofit company. " and all the blood drained out of my face. yeah.

1572
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:37,530
[laughter] i just spent a few billion dollars building this thing.

1573
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:38,730
cost $ 300, 000.

1574
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:45,050
and you know the chances of a nonprofit being able to pay for this thing is approximately zero.

1575
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,090
and he goes,

1576
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:46,570
you know,

1577
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:46,890
this is a

1578
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,730
it's an ai company and

1579
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:49,210
uh

1580
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,370
it's a nonprofit and and

1581
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:52,409
uh

1582
01:16:52,419 --> 01:16:53,690
we could really use one of these supercomputers.

1583
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,010
and so i i picked it up. i built the first one for ourselves.

1584
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,690
we're using it inside the company.

1585
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,810
i boxed one up.

1586
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:04,730
i drove it up to san francisco and i delivered to elon in 2016.

1587
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:07,370
a bunch of researchers were were there.

1588
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,050
peter beiel was there, ilia was there, and there was a bunch of people there. and uh

1589
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,449
i walk up to the second floor

1590
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:19,370
where they were all kind of in a room this smaller than your place here.

1591
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:21,770
and and uh

1592
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:22,330
uh

1593
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,850
that place turned out to have been open ai

1596
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:31,690
uh

1597
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,690
nonprofit anymore, though, is it? > > they're not

1598
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,969
they're not nonprofit anymore. yeah. > > weird how that works. > > yeah. yeah.

1599
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:40,969
but anyhow, anyhow, elon was there. the yeah, it was

1600
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:43,290
it was really a great great moment. > > oh, yeah.

1601
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:43,850
there you go.

1602
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:44,730
yeah, that's it.

1603
01:17:45,618 --> 01:17:46,489
[laughter] > > look at you, bro.

1604
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:46,969
same jacket.

1605
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,730
> > look at that.

1606
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:53,290

1607
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:53,290
uh

1608
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,890
the size of it is

1609
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:55,449
uh

1610
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,530
it's significantly smaller. that was the other day. spacex. > > oh, yeah.

1611
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,409
there you go. > > yeah.

1612
01:18:00,419 --> 01:18:01,130
look at the difference.

1613
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,650
> > exactly the same industrial design. he's holding it in his hand > > here.

1614
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,929
here's the amazing thing.

1615
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,690
djx1 was one pedlops.

1616
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:18,250
okay, that's a lot of flops. and djx spark is one pedlops.

1617
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,610
nine years later. > > wow. > > the same

1618
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:28,330
the same amount of computing horsepower > > in a much smaller > > shrunken down.

1619
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:28,650
yeah.

1620
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,449
> > and instead of $ 300, 000, it's now $ 4, 000.

1621
01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:35,050
and it's the size of a small book. > > incredible.

1622
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,810
> > crazy. > > that's how technology moves. anyways,

1623
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,170
that's the reason why i wanted to get

1624
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:41,050

1625

2016.

1627
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,130
> > it's so fascinating. i mean you

1628
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:48,010
if you wanted to make a story for a film

1629
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,250
i mean that would be the story that

1630
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:50,570
like

1631
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:51,449
what

1632
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,610
what better scenario

1633
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:54,010
if

1634
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,250
if

1635
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,730
if it really does become a digital life form

1636
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:04,010
how funny would it be that it is birthed out of the desire for computer graphics for video games

1637
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:06,650
[laughter] > > exactly > > kind of cra

1638
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:07,610
it's kind of crazy

1639
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:10,170
> > kind of crazy when you think about it that way

1640
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,130
> > because it's just

1641
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:13,929
> > perfect origin

1642
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:22,010
computer graphics was one of the hardest computer supercomputer problems generating reality

1643
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:28,810
> > and also one of the most profitable to solve because computer games are so popular. > >

1644
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:34,330
when nvidia started in 1993, we were trying to create this new computing approach.

1645
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:42,890
the question is what's the killer app? and the the problem we wanted to the

1646
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:46,409
the company wanted to create a new type of computing pro

1647
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,610
a computing architecture

1648
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,290
a computing a

1649
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:54,730
a new type of computer that can solve problems that normal computers can't solve.

1650
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:06,170
well, the applications that existed in the industry in 1993 are applications that normal computers can solve

1651
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,210
because if the normal computers can't solve them, why would the application exist?

1652
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:18,650
and so, we had a mission statement for a company that has no chance of success.

1653
01:20:19,545 --> 01:20:23,050
[laughter] but i didn't know that in 1993.

1654
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,690
it just sounded like a good idea, > > right?

1655
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:32,090
and so if we created this thing that can solve problems, you know,

1656
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:35,690
it's like you actually have to go create the problem.

1657
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:44,170
and so that's what we did in 1993. there was no quake. john carmarmac hadn't been reduced

1658
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:44,409
doom

1659
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,610
released doom yet.

1660
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:47,610
you probably remember that.

1661
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:48,090
> > sure.

1662
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:48,650
yeah.

1663
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,170
> > and and

1664
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:50,810
uh

1665
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:52,409
there were no applications for it.

1666
01:20:53,120 --> 01:20:59,850
and so i went to japan because the arcade industry had this at the time of sega,

1667
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:00,650
if you remember.

1668
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,050
> > sure.

1669
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:10,570
> > the arcade machines, they came out with 3d arcade systems, virtual fighter, daytona, virtual cop,

1670
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,530
all of those arcade games were in 3d for the f very first time.

1671
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,530
and the technology they were using was from martin marietta,

1672
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,370
the flight simulators.

1673
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:26,409
they took the guts out of a flight simulator and put it into an arcade machine.

1674
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,170
the system

1675
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:33,929
that you have over here, it's got to be a million times more powerful than that arcade machine.

1676
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,370
and that was a flight simulator for nasa.

1677
01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:42,090
whoa. and so they took the guts out of that. they were

1678
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,130
they were using it for flight simulation for jets and, you know,

1679
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,570
space shuttle

1680
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:46,969
and

1681
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:49,929
and they took the guts out of that. and sega

1682
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:51,050
uh

1683
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:54,570
had this brilliant computer de developer. his name was yuzuki.

1684
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,010
yuzuki and miiamoto.

1685
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,730
sega and nintendo.

1686
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:06,010
these were the, you know, the incredible pioneers, the visionaries,

1687
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,290
the incredible artists,

1688
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:15,130
and they're both very, very technical. they were the origins really of of the gaming industry.

1689
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:19,130
and y suzuki pioneered 3d graphics gaming

1690
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:20,330
and

1691
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:20,889
um

1692
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,130
so i went

1693
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:23,690
we

1694
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:29,690
we created this company and there were no apps and we were spending all of our afternoons

1695
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:30,650
you know

1696
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,810
we told our family we were going to work

1697
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,170
but it was just the three of us

1698
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,130
you know who's going to know

1699
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,090
and so we went to curtis's my

1700
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,370
one of one of the founders went to curtis's townhouse and

1701
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:41,850
uh

1702
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:42,650
chris and i were married

1703
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:43,290
we have kids

1704
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:45,050
i already had spencer

1705
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:45,610
at madison.

1706
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,050
they were probably 2 years old. and um

1707
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:50,969
and

1708
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:51,449
uh

1709
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,370
chris's kids are about the same age as ours.

1710
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:56,650
and we would go to work in this townhouse.

1711
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:58,409
but you know,

1712
01:22:58,419 --> 01:22:58,969
when you're a startup

1713
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,210
and the mission statement is the way we described, you're not going to have too many customers calling you.

1714
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,290
and so we had really nothing to do.

1715
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:11,050
and so after lunch, we would always have a great lunch.

1716
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:15,850
after lunch, we would go to the arcades and play the sega v,

1717
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:16,250
you know,

1718
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:17,130
the sega virtual fighter

1719
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:17,530
and daytona

1720
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:18,409
and all those games

1721
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,969
and analyze how they're doing it, trying to figure out how they they were doing that.

1722
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,090
and so we decided, um, let's just go to japan

1723
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:34,330
and let's convince sega to move those applications into the pc.

1724
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:38,010
and we would start the pc gaming

1725
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:42,010
the 3d gaming industry partnering with sega.

1726
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,210
that's how nvidia started.

1727
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:43,690
> > wow.

1728
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:44,969
> >

1729
01:23:44,979 --> 01:23:45,210
and so

1730
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:45,690
so

1731
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,170
uh

1732
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:57,050
in exchange for them part developing their games for our computers in the pc, we would build a chip for their game console.

1733
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:58,810
that was the partnership.

1734
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,010
i build a chip for your game console. you port the sega games to us

1735
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:05,690
and um

1736
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,130
and then they paid us a you know

1737
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,090
at the time

1738
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:13,449
a quite a significant amount of money to build that game console

1739
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:21,690
and that was kind of the beginning of nvidia getting started and we thought we were on our way

1740
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,489
and so so i started with a business plan

1741
01:24:24,499 --> 01:24:25,130
a mission statement

1742
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:25,690
that was impossible

1743
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,330
we lucked into the sega partnership

1744
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,330
we started taking off

1745
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,250
started building our game console.

1746
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:41,690
and about a couple years into it, we discovered our first technology didn't work. it was it

1747
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:42,570
it would have been a flaw.

1748
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:43,610
it it was a flaw.

1749
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:50,090
and all of the technology ideas that we had the architecture concepts were were sound,

1750
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,850
but the way we were doing computer graphics was exactly backwards.

1751
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,650
you know, instead of i won't bore you with the technology,

1752
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:01,610
but instead of inverse texture mapping,

1753
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,850
we were doing forward texture mapping.

1754
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:11,690
instead of triangles, we did curved surfaces. so, other people did it flat, we did it round.

1755
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,050
um,

1756
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,449
other technology, the technology that ultimately won,

1757
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,770
the technology we use today has has zbuffers. it automatically sorted.

1758
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,210
we had an architecture with no zbuffers.

1759
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,130
the application had to sort it.

1760
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:34,090
and so we chose a bunch of technology approaches that three major technology choices.

1761
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,090
all three choices were wrong. okay. so this is how incredibly smart

1762
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,570
we were.

1763
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,210
and so

1764
01:25:39,844 --> 01:25:41,449
[laughter] and so in 1995

1765
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:42,250
19

1766
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:42,889
early mid95

1767
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,250
we realized we were going down the wrong path.

1768
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:53,210
meanwhile, the silicon valley was packed with 3d graphics startups

1769
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,889
because it was the most exciting technology of that time.

1770
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:03,370
and so 3d fx and rendition and silicon graphics was coming in. intel was already in there

1771
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:04,489
and you know

1772
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,050
gosh

1773
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:10,250
like what added up eventually to a hundred different startups we had to compete against.

1774
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:15,850
everybody had chosen the right technology approach and we chose the wrong one.

1775
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:23,130
and so we were the first company to start. we found ourselves essentially dead last with the wrong answer.

1776
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,170
and so the company was in trouble

1777
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,370
and um

1778
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:38,969
ultimately we had to make several decisions. the first decision is well

1779
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,889
if we change

1780
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,889
now we will be the last company.

1781
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:57,850
and even if we changed into the technology that we believe to be right, we'd still be dead.

1782
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,850
and so that argument,

1783
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:01,690
you know,

1784
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,770
do we change

1785
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:10,810
and therefore be dead? don't change and make this technology work somehow or go do something completely different.

1786
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:20,730
that question stirred the company strategically and was a hard question. i eventually, you know, advocated

1787
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:21,290
for

1788
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,690
we don't know what the right strategy is, but we know what the wrong technology is.

1789
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,850
so, let's stop doing it the wrong way

1790
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,050
and let's give ourselves a chance to go figure out what the strategy is.

1791
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:36,730
the second thing, the second problem we had was our company was running out of money

1792
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:37,690
and i had

1793
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:41,770
i was in a contract with sega and i owed them this game console

1794
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:53,929
and if that contract would have been cancelled, we'd be dead. we would have vaporized instantly. and so so

1795
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:54,489
uh

1796
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,050
uh

1797
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,530
i went to japan and i explained to

1798
01:27:58,400 --> 01:27:58,650
uh

1799
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,290
the ceo of sega, erie madri,

1800
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:02,889
really great man.

1801
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,130
he was the former ceo of honda usa.

1802
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,370
went back to sega to run sega.

1803
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:10,889
went back to japan to run sega.

1804
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,290
and i explained to him that i was

1805
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,610
uh

1806
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:16,489
i guess i was what

1807
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:17,130
30

1808
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,889
33 years old. you know,

1809
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:23,050
when i was 33 years old, i still had acne.

1810
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:31,050
and i got this this, you know, chinese kid. i was super skinny. and he

1811
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:34,730
he was already kind of elder. and

1812
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:35,210
uh

1813
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:40,330
i went to him and i said i said, " listen, i've got some bad news for you.

1814
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:47,449
" and and first, the technology that we promised you doesn't work.

1815
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:56,730
and second, we shouldn't finish your contract

1816
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,570
because we'd waste all your money and you would have something that doesn't work.

1817
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,570
and i recommend you find another partner to build your game console.

1818
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,210
> > whoa.

1819
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:16,409
> > and so i'm terribly sorry that we've set you back in your product roadmap. and third,

1820
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,090
even though you're going to

1821
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:25,290
i'm asking you to let me out of the contract, i still need the money

1822
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:31,130
because if you didn't give me the money, we'd vaporize overnight.

1823
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:39,850
and so i explained it to him humbly, honestly.

1824
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,770
i gave him the background.

1825
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:49,610
explain to him why the technology doesn't work, why we thought it was going to work, why it doesn't work.

1826
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,330
and um

1827
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,850
and i asked him to

1828
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:56,409
uh

1829
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,010
convert the last $ 5 million

1830
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:09,850
that they were to complete the contract to give us that money as an investment instead.

1831
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:19,130
and he said, " but it's very likely your company will go out of business, even with my investment.

1832
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:22,889
" and it was completely true.

1833
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:27,449
back then, 1995, $ 5 million was a lot of money.

1834
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:28,570
it's a lot of money today.

1835
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,250
$ 5 million was a lot of money.

1836
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,130
and here's a pile of competitors doing it right.

1837
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:39,610
what are the chances that giving nvidia $ 5 million that we would develop the right strategy

1838
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:43,770
that he would get a return on that $ 5 million or even get it back? 0

1839
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:43,770
%.

1840
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,330
you do the math. it's 0

1841
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:46,330
%.

1842
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,610
if i were sitting there right there, i wouldn't have done it.

1843
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,850
$ 5 million was a mountain of money to sega at the time.

1844
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,370
and so i told him that that that

1845
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,010
um

1846
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:03,690
uh

1847
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:10,650
if you invested that $ 5 million in us, it is most likely to be lost.

1848
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,889
but if you didn't invest that money, we'd be out of business and we would have no chance.

1849
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:19,690
and i i told him

1850
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:30,489
that i i don't even know exactly what i said in the end, but i told him

1851
01:31:30,499 --> 01:31:37,210
that i would understand if he decided not to, but it would make the world to me if he did.

1852
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:38,650
he went off

1853
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,969
and thought about it for a couple days and came back and said, " we'll do it.

1854
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:41,690
" > > wow.

1855
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:49,530
strategy to how to correct what it was doing wrong. did you explain that to him? > > wait,

1856
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:49,850
oh man,

1857
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,489
wait until i tell you the rest of it's scarier. even scarier. > > oh no.

1858
01:31:54,499 --> 01:32:05,449
[laughter] > > and so so um so what he what he decided was was

1859
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:06,090
uh

1860
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,929
jensen was a young man he liked. that's it.

1861
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:10,730
> > wow.

1862
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:13,929
to this day. > > that's nuts.

1863
01:32:14,719 --> 01:32:15,210
> > i was

1864
01:32:15,280 --> 01:32:15,530
>

1865
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:15,530
> boy,

1866
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:21,530
do you owe what the world owes that guy. > > no doubt, > > right? > > well,

1867
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:21,530
he's

1868
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:21,770
he

1869
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:22,010
c

1870
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:24,010
he's he celebrated today in japan.

1871
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,010
> >

1872
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,290
and if he would have kept that five

1873
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:28,730
>

1874
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:29,370
> the the investment,

1875
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:36,889
i think it'd be worth probably about a trillion dollars today. i know.

1876
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,770
but the moment we went public, they sold it.

1877
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:42,810
they go, " wow, that's a miracle. " so, [laughter] > > wow.

1878
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:43,850
> > they sold it. yeah.

1879
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:52,090
they sold it at nvidia valuation about 300 million. that's our ipo valuation. 300 million. > > wow.

1880
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:54,170
> >

1881
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:59,210
and so, so anyhow, i was incredibly grateful. um,

1882
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:02,570
and then now we had to figure out what to do

1883
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,090
because we still were doing the wrong strategy, wrong technology.

1884
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:11,210
so unfortunately we had to lay off most of the company. we shrunk the company all back.

1885
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:13,370
all the people working on the game console,

1886
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:14,010
you know,

1887
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,850
we had to shrunk it all. shrink it all back. and um

1888
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:21,130
and then

1889
01:33:21,140 --> 01:33:22,810
and then somebody told me that,

1890
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:23,690
but jensen,

1891
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,210
we've never built it this way before.

1892
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:32,810
we've never built it the right way before. we've only know how to build it the wrong way.

1893
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:42,650
and so nobody in the company knew how to build this supercomputing image generator

1894
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,770
3d graphics thing that silicon graphics did.

1895
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:47,770
and so so

1896
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:48,250
uh

1897
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:54,010
i said, " okay, how hard can it be? you got all these 30 companies, you know,

1898
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:54,969
50 companies doing it.

1899
01:33:54,979 --> 01:34:02,570
how hard can it be? " and so luckily there was a textbook written by the company silicon graphics.

1900
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,250
and so i went down to the store.

1901
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,770
i had 200 bucks in my pocket.

1902
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:13,050
and i bought three textbooks, the only three they had, $ 60 a piece.

1903
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,570
i bought the three textbooks. i brought it back and i gave one to each one of the architects

1904
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,449
and i said, " read that and let's go save the company. " > > [laughter] >

1905
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:23,449
>

1906
01:34:23,459 --> 01:34:26,065
and so [gasps and sighs]

1907
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:26,810
so they they

1908
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:34,969
they read this textbook, learned from the giant at the time, silicon graphics, about how to do 3d graphics.

1909
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,210
but the thing that was amazing

1910
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,650
and what makes nvidia special today is

1911
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,130
that the people

1912
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:52,330
that are there are able to start from first principles, learn best known art, but reimplement it in a way

1913
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,370
that's never been done before.

1914
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:55,690
and so

1915
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:02,969
when we re-imagined the technology of 3d graphics, we reimagined it in a way

1916
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,889
that manifest today the modern 3d graphics.

1917
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:15,210
we really invented modern 3d graphics, but we learned from previous known arts and we implement it fundamentally differently.

1918
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:19,610
> > what did you do that changed it? well, you know,

1919
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:21,610
the ultimately ultimately

1920
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,010
the

1921
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:22,409
um

1922
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:23,530
uh

1923
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,570
the simple

1924
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:28,250
the simple answer is that the way silicon graphics works

1925
01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:29,449
uh

1926
01:35:29,459 --> 01:35:32,969
the geometry engine is a bunch of software running on processors.

1927
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:35,690
we took that

1928
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:45,449
and eliminated all the generality, the general purposeness of it

1929
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,010
and we reduced it down into the most essential part of 3d graphics

1930
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,690
and we hardcoded it into the chip.

1931
01:35:54,800 --> 01:36:06,650
and so instead of something general purpose, we hardcoded it very specifically into just the limited applications, limited functionality necessary for video games.

1932
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,130
and that capability that super

1933
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:16,810
and and because we reinvented a whole bunch of stuff, it supercharged the capability of that one little chip.

1934
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:24,730
and our one little chip was generating images as fast as a $ 1 million image generator.

1935
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,489
that was the big breakthrough.

1936
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,330
we took a million dollar thing

1937
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:33,210
and we put it into the graphics card that you now put into your gaming pc.

1938
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,290
and that was [snorts] our big invention. and then

1939
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,170
and of course

1940
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:39,210
the question is is

1941
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:39,770
um

1942
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:41,610
uh

1943
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:48,730
how do you compete against these 30 other companies doing what they were doing? and and there we did

1944
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:50,570
we did several things. one

1945
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:52,170
uh

1946
01:36:52,800 --> 01:37:02,170
instead of building a 3d graphics chip for every 3d graphics application, we decided to build a 3d graphics chip for one application.

1947
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,650
we bet the farm on video games.

1948
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:11,050
the needs of video games are very different than needs for cad, needs for flight simulators.

1949
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,889
they're related, but not the same.

1950
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,330
and so we narrowly focused our problem statement so i could reject all of the other complexities

1951
01:37:19,119 --> 01:37:22,090
and we shrunk it down into this one little focus

1952
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,250
and then we supercharged it for gamers.

1953
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:32,090
and then the second thing that we did was we created a whole ecosystem of working with game developers

1954
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,250
and getting their their games ported

1955
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,889
and adapted to our silicon so

1956
01:37:36,899 --> 01:37:45,290
that we could get turn essentially what is a technology business into a platform business into a game platform business.

1957
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,730
so we, you know,

1958
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:47,369
geforce is

1959
01:37:47,379 --> 01:37:47,530
really

1960
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:48,570
today

1961
01:37:48,639 --> 01:37:53,290
it's also the most advanced 3d graphics technology in the world, but a long time ago

1962
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:58,889
geforce is really the game console inside your pc. it's, you know,

1963
01:37:58,899 --> 01:38:01,050
it runs windows, it runs excel, it runs powerpoint,

1964
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:01,690
of course,

1965
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:08,409
those are easy things, but its fundamental purpose was simply to turn your pc into a game console.

1966
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,290
so we

1967
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:18,090
we were the first technology company to build all of this incredible technology in service of one audience gamers.

1968
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:19,210
now

1969
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:19,530
of course

1970
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:19,929
in 1993

1971
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,810
the gaming industry didn't exist.

1972
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:29,210
but by the time that john carmarmac came along and the doom phenomenon happened

1973
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,969
and then quake came out

1974
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:32,650
as you know

1975
01:38:34,239 --> 01:38:35,369
that entire world

1976
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:35,690
oh

1977
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:38,170
that entire community boom took off.

1978
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,850
do you know where the name doom came from? > > it came from this se

1979
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,010
there's a scene in the movie the color of money

1980
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,449
where tom cruz

1981
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:46,330
who's this

1982
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,650
uh

1983
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,730
elite pool player shows up at this pool hall

1984
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:53,290
and this local hustler says what he got in the case and he opens up this case.

1985
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,650
he has a special pool queue.

1986
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,369
he goes in here and he opens it up. he goes, " doom. > > doom.

1987
01:38:57,379 --> 01:39:00,010
" [laughter] > > and that's where it came from. yeah.

1988
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:03,210
cuz carmarmac said that's what they wanted to do to the gaming industry. > > doom.

1989
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:06,969
> > that when doom came out, it would just be everybody be like, " oh, we're fucked.

1990
01:39:06,979 --> 01:39:07,770
" > > oh, wow.

1991
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,330
> > this is doom.

1992
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:08,969
> > that's awesome.

1993
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:10,250
> > isn't that amazing? that's amazing.

1994
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,850
> > cuz it's the perfect name for the game.

1995
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,810
> > yeah. > > and the name came out of that scene in that movie.

1996
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:15,449
> > that's right.

1997
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,730
well, and then

1998
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:17,210
of course,

1999
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:18,170
uh,

2000
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,130
tim sweeney

2001
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:22,409
and > > epic games and, uh,

2002
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:25,210
and the 3d gaming genre took off. > > yes.

2003
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,369
> > and so, if you just kind of

2004
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:29,369
in the beginning was no gaming industry.

2005
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:33,449
we had no choice but to focus the company on one thing.

2006
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:38,170
that one thing, > > it's a really incredible origin story. > > oh, it's

2007
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,409
it's amazing. like you must be like

2008
01:39:40,419 --> 01:39:41,050
look back

2009
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:42,250
> > a disaster is what

2010
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:43,130
> > a $ 5 [laughter] million

2011
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,090
that pivot with that conversation with that gentleman

2012
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,929
if he did not agree to that

2013
01:39:47,939 --> 01:39:49,050
if he did not like you

2014
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:50,810
what would the world look like

2015
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:51,050
today

2016
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:51,770
that's crazy

2017
01:39:52,560 --> 01:40:00,570
then then our entire life hung on another gentleman and so so now here we are

2018
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:00,969
we built

2019
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:01,690
so

2020
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:02,250
before geforce

2021
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:02,969
it was revo

2022
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:03,610
128

2023
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:06,250
revo 128 saved the company

2024
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,330
it revolutionized computer graphics

2025
01:40:09,199 --> 01:40:15,130
the performance cost performance ratio of 3d graphics for gaming was off the charts amazing.

2026
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:25,050
and we're getting ready to to ship it. get well, we're

2027
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,210
we're building it, but we're

2028
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,010
so

2029
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:29,210
as you know,

2030
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:33,690
$ 5 million doesn't last long. and so every single month, every single month,

2031
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:34,969
uh

2032
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:36,010
we were drawing down

2033
01:40:39,119 --> 01:40:42,090
you have to build it, prototype it.

2034
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:49,530
you have to design it, prototype it, get the silicon back, which costs a lot of money.

2035
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,530
test it with software

2036
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:56,409
because without the software testing the chip, you don't know the chip works.

2037
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,690
and then you're going to find a bug

2038
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:00,489
probably

2039
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:02,969
because every time you test something

2040
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:10,570
you find bugs, which means you have to tape it out again, which is more time, more money.

2041
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:12,889
and so we did the math.

2042
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,810
there was no chance anybody was going to survive it.

2043
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:19,850
we didn't have that much time to tape out a chip, send it to a foundry tsmc,

2044
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:25,449
get the silicon back, test it, send it back out again. there was no no shot, no hope.

2045
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:32,170
and so the math, the spreadsheet doesn't allow us to do that.

2046
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:38,570
and so i heard about this company and this company built this machine.

2047
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,170
and this machine is an emulator.

2048
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:51,050
you could take your design, all of the software that describes the chip,

2049
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,170
and you could put it into this machine.

2050
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,489
and this machine will pretend it's our chip.

2051
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,690
so i don't have to send it to the fab, wait until the fab sends it back, test.

2052
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,250
i could have this machine pretend it's our chip

2053
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,330
and i could put all of the software on top of this machine called an emulator

2054
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:13,449
and test all of the software on this pretend chip

2055
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:17,530
and i could fix it all before i send it to the fab.

2056
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:18,250
> > whoa.

2057
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:23,690
and if and and if i could do that when i send it to the fab, it should work.

2058
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,570
nobody knows, but it should work.

2059
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:28,889
and so we came to the conclusion

2060
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:34,489
that let's take half of the money we had left in the bank.

2061
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:36,889
at the time it was about a million dollars.

2062
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,889
take half of that money and go buy this machine.

2063
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:47,290
so instead of keeping the money to stay alive, i took half of the money to go buy this machine.

2064
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:49,530
well, i call this guy up. this

2065
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:50,810
the company's called ios.

2066
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:54,409
call this company up and i say, " hey, listen.

2067
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:55,610
i heard about this machine.

2068
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,010
i like to buy one.

2069
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:03,690
" and they go, " h, that's terrific, but we're out of business.

2070
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:08,650
" i said, " what? you're out of business? " he goes, " yeah, we had no customers.

2071
01:43:08,660 --> 01:43:14,570
" [laughter] i said, " wait, hang on a sec.

2072
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:16,889
so, you never made the machine? " they [snorts] can say, " no,

2073
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:17,130
no,

2074
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:17,290
no.

2075
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:17,929
we made the machine.

2076
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,770
we have one in inventory if you want it, but we're out of business.

2077
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:24,010
" so, i bought one out of inventory.

2078
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,850
okay. after i bought it, they went out of business. > > wow.

2079
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,369
> > i bought it out of inventory.

2080
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:40,330
and on this machine, we put nvidia's chip into it and we tested all of the software on top.

2081
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:43,770
and at this point, we were on fumes.

2082
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:47,850
but we convinced ourselves that chip is going to be great.

2083
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:56,730
and so i had to call some other gentleman. so i called tsmc. and i told tsmc that

2084
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:57,050
listen,

2085
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,530
tsmc is the world's largest founder today.

2086
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:07,530
at the time they were just a few hundred million dollars large, tiny little company.

2087
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:15,690
and i explained to them what we were doing. and um

2088
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:17,610
i explained to him

2089
01:44:17,620 --> 01:44:21,290
i told him i had a lot of customers. i had one, you know,

2090
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:21,770
diamond multimedia,

2091
01:44:23,119 --> 01:44:26,409
probably one of the companies you bought the graphics card from back in the old days.

2092
01:44:26,419 --> 01:44:28,889
and i i said, you know,

2093
01:44:28,899 --> 01:44:29,690
we have a lot of customers,

2094
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,889
and the demand's really great,

2095
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:38,810
and we're going to tape out a chip to you, and i like to go directly to production

2096
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:42,330
because i know it works.

2097
01:44:44,142 --> 01:44:45,850
> > [snorts] >

2098
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:45,850
>

2099
01:44:45,860 --> 01:44:48,090
and they said, " nobody has ever done that before.

2100
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:52,969
nobody has ever taped out a chip that worked the first time.

2101
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:57,449
and nobody starts out production without looking at it.

2102
01:44:57,459 --> 01:45:02,810
" but i knew that if i didn't start the production, i'd be out of business anyways.

2103
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,449
and if i could start the production, i might have a chance.

2104
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:13,850
and so tsmc decided to support me

2105
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:14,570
and

2106
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:15,050
uh

2107
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:16,810
this gentleman is named morris chang.

2108
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:22,170
morris chang is the father of the foundry industry, the founder of tsmc.

2109
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:29,449
really great man. he decided to support our company.

2110
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,130
i explained to them everything.

2111
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,090
he decided to support us frankly

2112
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,610
probably because they didn't have that many other customers anyhow

2113
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:41,690
but they were grateful and i was immensely grateful

2114
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,250
and as we were starting the production

2115
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,929
morris flew to united states and

2116
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:48,409
uh

2117
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:51,290
he didn't

2118
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:51,929
so many words

2119
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:53,050
asked me so

2120
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:57,130
but he asked me a whole lot of questions that was trying to tease out

2121
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:59,130
do i have any money

2122
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:02,170
but he didn't directly ask me that

2123
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:03,210
you know

2124
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:07,850
and so the truth is that we didn't have all the money

2125
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:10,810
but we had a strong po from the customer

2126
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:14,250
and if it didn't work

2127
01:46:15,199 --> 01:46:16,489
some wafers would have been lost

2128
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:17,850
and i'm you

2129
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:20,010
know i i'm not exactly sure what would have happened

2130
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:21,530
but we would have come short

2131
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:23,130
it would have been

2132
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:23,929
it would have been rough

2133
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,010
but they supported us with all of that risk involved

2134
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:33,690
we launched this chip turns out to been completely revolutionary.

2135
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,050
knocked the ball out of the park.

2136
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:43,690
we became the fastest growing technology company in history to go from zero to $ 1 billion.

2137
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:47,449
> > so wild that you didn't test the chip. > > i know.

2138
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:55,130
we tested afterwards. yeah, we tested afterwards. > > afterwards, but [laughter] production already. but by the way,

2139
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:55,770
by the way,

2140
01:46:56,159 --> 01:47:02,489
that methodology that we developed to save the company is used throughout the world today.

2141
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:03,929
> > that's amazing. > > yeah,

2142
01:47:03,939 --> 01:47:04,330
we changed

2143
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:09,369
we changed the whole world's methodology of designing chips. the whole world's uh

2144
01:47:09,379 --> 01:47:11,130
rhythm of designing chips. uh

2145
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:12,090
we changed everything.

2146
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:20,010
> > how well did you sleep those days? it must have been so much stress, [laughter] > > you know.

2147
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:20,489
um,

2148
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,010
what is that feeling where where

2149
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:26,570
uh

2150
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:30,650
the world just kind of feels like it's flying? it

2151
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:31,449
you

2152
01:47:31,459 --> 01:47:31,929
you have this

2153
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,610
what do you call that feeling? you can't

2154
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:36,730
you can't stop the

2155
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,650
the feeling that everything's moving

2156
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:39,210
super fast

2157
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,530
and you know

2158
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:47,369
and you're laying in your laying in bed and the world just feels like you know it

2159
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:47,770
you

2160
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:48,570
and you're

2161
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:48,969
you

2162
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:50,489
you feel deeply anxious

2163
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:52,090
uh

2164
01:47:52,159 --> 01:47:53,210
completely out of control.

2165
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,010
um

2166
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:59,690
i've felt that probably a couple of times [laughter] in my life.

2167
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:04,090
it's during that time. > > wow. > > yeah. it

2168
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:04,650
it was incredible.

2169
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,409
> > what an incredible success story.

2170
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,969
> > but i i learned i learned a lot. i learned i learned about

2171
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,130
i learned several things. i learned i learned

2172
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:11,610
uh

2173
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,409
how to develop strategies.

2174
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:14,650
um

2175
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:15,690
i learned how to

2176
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:17,210
uh

2177
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:17,850
uh

2178
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:18,570
and when i

2179
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:19,369
when i you know

2180
01:48:19,379 --> 01:48:21,050
our company learned how to develop strategies.

2181
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,090
what are winning strategies?

2182
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:29,369
we learned how to create a market. we created the modern 3d gaming market. we learned how

2183
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:29,690
and

2184
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,810
and so that exact same skill is how we created the modern ai market.

2185
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:38,010
it's exactly the same. > > wow. > > yeah.

2186
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,810
exactly the same skill. exactly the same blueprint.

2187
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:42,250
and

2188
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:43,770
uh

2189
01:48:43,780 --> 01:48:44,650
we learned how to

2190
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:45,130
uh

2191
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:50,889
deal with crisis, how to stay calm, how to think through things systematically.

2192
01:48:52,639 --> 01:48:56,810
we learned how to remove all waste in the company

2193
01:48:57,199 --> 01:49:00,730
and work from first principles and doing only the things that are essential.

2194
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:08,330
everything else is waste because we have no money for it to live on fumes at all times.

2195
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:13,850
and the feeling no different than the feeling i had this morning

2196
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:18,010
when i woke up that you're going to be out of business soon.

2197
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:18,969
that you're

2198
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:19,449
you know

2199
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:20,090
the phrase

2200
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:22,250
30 days from going out of business

2201
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,170
i've used for 33 years because > > you still feel that. > > oh yeah.

2202
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:26,570
oh yeah.

2203
01:49:26,639 --> 01:49:28,250
every morning. every morning. > >

2204
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:31,210
but but you guys are one of the biggest companies on planet earth.

2205
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,650
but the the feeling doesn't change. > > wow. > > the

2206
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:39,369
the sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity.

2207
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:40,810
uh

2208
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:42,330
it

2209
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:43,850
it doesn't leave you.

2210
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:44,730
> > that's crazy.

2211
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,650
we were, you know, we had nothing. we had nothing. we were dealing with giant. > > oh, yeah.

2212
01:49:50,660 --> 01:49:52,730
oh, yeah. every day, every moment.

2213
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:53,449
> > do you think

2214
01:49:53,459 --> 01:49:54,409
that fuels you? is

2215
01:49:54,419 --> 01:49:56,889
that part of the reason why the company's so successful?

2216
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,010
that you have

2217
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:09,210
that hungry mentality, that you never rest, you're never sitting on your laurels, you're always on the edge.

2218
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:21,850
i have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed.

2219
01:50:22,781 --> 01:50:25,449
[laughter] > > isn't

2220
01:50:25,459 --> 01:50:27,929
that like sex coaches would tell you

2221
01:50:27,939 --> 01:50:30,969
that's completely the wrong psychology? > > the world has just heard me say

2222
01:50:30,979 --> 01:50:32,489
that for out loud for the first time.

2223
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,170
> > but but it's true. > > well, that's how fascinating.

2224
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:43,449
fear of failure drives me more than the than the the greed or whatever it is.

2225
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,170
> > well, ultimately

2226
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,250
that's probably a more healthy approach

2227
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,570
now that i'm thinking about it

2228
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:50,170
because like the fear

2229
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:50,889
> > i'm not ambitious

2230
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:51,850
for example,

2231
01:50:52,256 --> 01:50:54,730
[laughter] you know, i just want to stay alive, joe.

2232
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,290
i want the company to thrive,

2233
01:50:57,520 --> 01:50:57,850
you know,

2234
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,250
i want us to make an impact. > > that's interesting.

2235
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:03,610
> > yeah. > > well, maybe that's why you're so humble. that's what

2236
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:06,090
maybe that's what keeps you grounded, you know,

2237
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:10,810
because with the kind of spectacular success the company's achieved, it would be easy to get a big head.

2238
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,610
> > no.

2239
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:12,409
> > right.

2240
01:51:12,419 --> 01:51:19,210
but isn't that interesting? it's like the if you were the guy that your main focus is just success.

2241
01:51:20,239 --> 01:51:22,650
you probably would go, " well, made it.

2242
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,449
nailed it.

2243
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:24,170
i'm the [laughter] man.

2244
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:25,610
> > drop the mic.

2245

2247

2248
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,050
that's crazy.

> > well, listen.

2251
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:38,170
if i was a major investor in your company, that's what i'd want running it.

2252
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,290
i'd want a guy who's > > yeah.

2253

> > that's what i work.

2254
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:45,290
that's why i work seven days a week.

2255
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,050
every moment i'm i'm awake.

2256
01:51:47,760 --> 01:51:48,730

2257

2260
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,409
but so [laughter] could be next week.

2261
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:01,290
sounds exhausting.

2262
01:52:02,159 --> 01:52:02,810
> > it is exhausting.

2263
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,409

2264
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:06,730

2265
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:10,250
> > wow. > > always in a state of anxiety. > > wow.

2266
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,010
kudos to you for admitting that.

2267
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,250
i think that's important for a lot of people to hear

2268
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:21,290
because, you know, there's probably some young people out there that are in a similar position to

2269
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:22,010
where you were

2270
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:22,969
when you were starting out

2271
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:28,330
that just feel like, oh, those people that have made it, they're just smarter than me

2272
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:32,730
and they had more opportunities than me and it's just like it was handed to them

2273
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,130
or they're just in the right place at the right time.

2274
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:40,650
and > > joe, i just described to you somebody who didn't know what was going on, [laughter] actually did it wrong.

2275
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:42,250
> > yeah. yeah.

2276
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:45,770
and the ultimate diving catch like two or three times. > > crazy.

2277
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:46,730
> > yeah.

2278
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:49,530
> > the ultimate diving catch is the perfect way to put it.

2279
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,170
> > you know, it's just like the edge of your glove.

2280
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:57,050
[laughter] > > it probably bounced off of somebody's helmet and landed at the edge.

2281
01:52:58,673 --> 01:53:01,290
[laughter] > > god, that's incredible.

2282
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:02,730
that's incredible.

2283
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:08,010
but it's also it's really cool that you have this perspective that you look at it that way

2284
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:13,050
because you know a lot of people that have delusions of grandeur

2285
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,570
or they have

2286
01:53:14,719 --> 01:53:15,130
you know

2287
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:15,849
> >

2288
01:53:15,859 --> 01:53:24,730
and their rewriting of history often times had them somehow extraord extraordinarily smart

2289
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:27,929
and they were geniuses and they knew all along and they were

2290
01:53:27,939 --> 01:53:28,570
they were spot-on.

2291
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:30,969
and the business plan was exactly what they thought.

2292
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:34,650
and > > yeah, > > they destroyed the competition and you know

2293
01:53:34,660 --> 01:53:35,849
and they emerged victorious.

2294
01:53:36,663 --> 01:53:41,210
[laughter] > > meanwhile, you're like, i'm scared every day.

2295
01:53:41,840 --> 01:53:45,929
> > exactly. [laughter] exactly. > > that's so funny.

2296
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,610
oh my god, that's amazing.

2297
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:48,570
> > it's so true, though.

2298
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:49,210
> > it's amazing.

2299
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,090

2300
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:50,810
> > it's amazing.

2301
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:58,810
well, but i i think there's nothing inconsistent with being a leader and being vulnerable. you know, i

2302
01:53:59,360 --> 01:54:08,409
the company doesn't need me to be a genius right all along, right? absolutely certain about what i'm trying to do

2303
01:54:08,419 --> 01:54:09,290
and what i'm doing.

2304
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:14,570
the the company doesn't need that. the company wants me to succeed. you know, the thing that

2305
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,170
and we started out today talking about president trump

2306
01:54:18,180 --> 01:54:23,290
and i was about to say something and listen, he is my president.

2307
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:26,090
he is our president. we should all

2308
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,969
and we're talking about just because it's president trump,

2309
01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:30,250
we all want him to be wrong.

2310
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:37,369
i think that united states, we all have to realize he is our president, we want him to succeed

2311
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:39,849
because > > no matter who's president attitude.

2312
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:40,730
> > that's right.

2313
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:42,489
> > we want him to succeed.

2314
01:54:42,800 --> 01:54:46,810
we need to help him succeed because it helps everybody, all of us succeed.

2315
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:53,929
and i'm lucky that i work in a company

2316
01:54:53,939 --> 01:54:56,810
where i have 40, 000 people who wants me to succeed.

2317
01:54:58,239 --> 01:54:59,210
they want me to succeed

2318
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,010
and i can tell

2319
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:03,929
and they're all every single day to help me overcome these challenges

2320
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:11,050
trying to realize realize what i describe to be our strategy doing their best.

2321
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:15,849
and if it's somehow wrong or not perfectly right

2322
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:18,409
to tell me so that we could pivot

2323
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:22,170
and the more vulnerable we are as a leader

2324
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:25,530
the more able other people are able to tell you

2325
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:26,570
you know that

2326
01:55:26,580 --> 01:55:26,730
jensen

2327
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:28,810
that's not exactly right or > > right

2328
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:29,290
right

2329
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:29,610
> >

2330
01:55:29,620 --> 01:55:31,130
have you considered this information or

2331
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,090
and the more vulnerable we are

2332
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:37,369
the more able we're actually able to pivot

2333
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,489
if we put ourselves into this superhuman capability

2334
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,409
then it's hard for us to pivot strategy,

2335
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:43,130
> > right?

2336
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,889
> > because we were supposed to be right all along.

2337
01:55:45,920 --> 01:55:48,889
> > and so if you're always right, how can you possibly pivot?

2338
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:50,810
because pivoting requires you to be wrong.

2339
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,290
and so i've got no trouble with being wrong.

2340
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:55,130
i just have to make sure

2341
01:55:55,199 --> 01:56:00,250
that i stay alert, that i reason about things from first principles all the time.

2342
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,130
always break things down to first principles.

2343
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:04,570
understand why it's happening.

2344
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:14,330
reassess continuously. the reassessing continuously is kind of partly what causes continuous anxiety, > > you know,

2345
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:20,250
because you're asking yourself, were you wrong yesterday? are you still right? is this the same? has

2346
01:56:20,260 --> 01:56:22,250
that changed? has that condition

2347
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:23,770
is that worse than you thought?

2348
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:26,650
> > but god, that mindset is perfect for your business, though,

2349
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,730
because this business is ever changing

2350
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:29,770
> > all the time.

2351
01:56:30,239 --> 01:56:31,929
i've got competition coming from every direction.

2352
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:38,409
so much of it is kind of up in the air and you have to invent a future

2353
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:45,770
where a 100 variables are included and there's no way you could be right on all of them.

2354
01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:47,449
and so you have to be

2355
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:48,730
> > you have to surf.

2356
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:49,690
> > wow.

2357
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:51,690
that's a good way to put it.

2358
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:56,090
you have to surf. yeah. you're surfing waves of technology and innovation. > > that's right.

2359
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:00,170
you can't predict the waves. you got to deal with the ones you have. > > wow.

2360
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,010
and but skill matters

2361
01:57:03,119 --> 01:57:04,730
and i've been doing this for 30

2362
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:07,770
i'm the longest running tech ceo in the world. > > is that true?

2363
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:08,170
congratulations.

2364
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:09,210
that's amazing.

2365
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:11,530
> > and you know people ask me

2366
01:57:11,540 --> 01:57:12,090
how is

2367
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:12,330
one

2368
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:22,650
don't get fired. [laughter] that'll stop a short heartbeat. and then two don't get bored. > > yeah.

2369
01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:24,010
> > well, how do you maintain your enthusiasm?

2370
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:32,010
well, the honor truth is is not always enthusiasm. it's, you know,

2371
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:32,969
sometimes is enthusiasm.

2372
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:41,210
sometimes it's just good oldfashioned fear and then sometimes, you know, a healthy dose of frustration, you know,

2373
01:57:41,220 --> 01:57:43,130
it's whatever keeps you moving.

2374
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:43,690
> > yeah.

2375
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,929
just all the emotions. i think,

2376
01:57:45,939 --> 01:57:46,330
you know,

2377
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:47,050
> > ceos,

2378
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:49,929
we have all the emotions, right? you know,

2379
01:57:49,939 --> 01:57:55,290
and so probably probably jacked up to the maximum because you're

2380
01:57:55,300 --> 01:57:57,690
you're kind of feeling it on behalf of the whole company.

2381
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:03,210
i'm feeling it on behalf of everybody at the same time. and it kind of, you know,

2382
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,770
encapsulates into into somebody.

2383
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:09,210
and so i have to be mindful of the past.

2384
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,929
i have to be mindful of the present. i've got to be mindful of the future.

2385
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:13,050
and um

2386
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:14,889
you know, it

2387
01:58:14,899 --> 01:58:15,130
can't

2388
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:19,050
it's not without emotion. it's not just it's

2389
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:20,810
it's not just a job.

2390
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:22,010
let's just put it that way.

2391
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:24,409
> > it doesn't seem like it at all.

2392
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:28,250
i would imagine one of the more difficult aspects of your job currently

2393
01:58:28,719 --> 01:58:32,090
now that the company is massively successful is anticipating

2394
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:36,650
where technology is headed and where the applications are going to be.

2395
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:41,449
> > yeah. > > so, how do you try to map that out? > > yeah. there there

2396
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:41,849
um

2397
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:43,050
there

2398
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,650
there's a whole bunch of ways

2399
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,969
and and it takes it takes

2400
01:58:47,199 --> 01:58:47,449
um

2401
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,449
takes a whole bunch of things

2402
01:58:51,459 --> 01:58:52,409
but let me just start

2403
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:53,929
uh

2404
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:58,330
you have to be surrounded by amazing people and nvidia is now

2405
01:58:59,199 --> 01:58:59,610
you know

2406
01:58:59,620 --> 01:59:00,090
if you look at

2407
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:00,570
look at

2408
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:01,369
look at

2409
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:01,849
um

2410
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:04,570
the large tech companies in the world today

2411
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:10,090
most of them have a business in advertising or social media

2412
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,010
or you know

2413
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:13,449
content distribution

2414
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:19,210
and at the core of it is really fundamental computer science

2415
01:59:20,400 --> 01:59:22,810
and so the company's business is not computers

2416
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:25,610
the company's business is not technology

2417
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:26,730
technology drives

2418
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,929
the company is the only company in the world that's large

2419
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:32,409
whose only business is technology

2420
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:34,250
we only build

2421
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:34,489
techn

2422
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,130
we don't advertise

2423
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:39,530
the only way that we make money is to create amazing technology and sell

2424
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:40,889
and so

2425
01:59:43,199 --> 01:59:43,929
to be that

2426
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,130
to be nvidia

2427
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:50,650
today, you're the number one thing is you're surrounded by the finest computer scientists in the world.

2428
01:59:51,119 --> 01:59:52,489
and that's my gift.

2429
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:58,170
my gift is that we've created a company's culture, a condition

2430
01:59:59,199 --> 02:00:02,409
by which the world's greatest computer scientists want to be part of it

2431
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:06,090
because they get to do their life's work and create the next thing

2432
02:00:06,560 --> 02:00:09,610
because that's what they want to do. because maybe they're not

2433
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:12,969
they don't want to be in service of another business.

2434
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,690
> > they want to be in service of the technology itself.

2435
02:00:16,080 --> 02:00:19,130
and we're the largest form of its kind in the history of the world.

2436
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,570
> > wow. > > i know.

2437
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:23,849
it's pretty amazing. > > wow. > > and so so one,

2438
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:25,449
you know,

2439
02:00:25,459 --> 02:00:27,050
we have a we we have got a great condition.

2440
02:00:27,199 --> 02:00:28,409
we have a great culture.

2441
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:34,010
we have great people. and then now now now the question is how do you systematically

2442
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:36,330
um

2443
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:40,010
be able to see the future

2444
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:42,489
stay alert of it

2445
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:44,250
and

2446
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:45,449
uh

2447
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:46,090
reduce

2448
02:00:46,239 --> 02:00:46,489
the

2449
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:46,969
reduce

2450
02:00:47,119 --> 02:00:51,369
the the likelihood of missing something or being wrong.

2451
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:55,130
and so there's a lot of different ways you could do that.

2452
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:56,250
for example, we have great partnerships.

2453
02:00:56,260 --> 02:00:58,250
we we have fundamental research.

2454
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:02,730
we have a great research lab, one of the largest industrial research labs in the world today.

2455
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:08,570
and we partner with a whole bunch of universities and other scientists. we do a lot of open collaboration

2456
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:18,090
and so i'm constantly working with researchers outside the company. we have the benefit of having amazing customers

2457
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:22,330
and so i have the benefit of working with elon and you know

2458
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:23,610
and others in the industry

2459
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:29,929
and we have the benefit of being the only pure pure play technology company that can serve

2460
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:31,290
uh

2461
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:31,929
consumer

2462
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:32,409
internet

2463
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:34,090
industrial

2464
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:34,650
manufacturing

2465
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:36,650
um

2466
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:36,969
scientific

2467
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:37,530
computing

2468
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:38,730
healthcare

2469
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:40,010
financial

2470
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:40,570
services

2471
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:48,889
all the industries that we're in. they're all signals to me. and so they all have mathematicians and scientists

2472
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:49,530
and

2473
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:50,409
and so

2474
02:01:50,419 --> 02:01:55,050
because i i have the benefit now of a radar system > >

2475
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:57,130
that is the most broad of any company in the world

2476
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,090
working across every single industry

2477
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:04,570
from agriculture to energy to video games.

2478
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:12,170
and so the ability for us to have this vantage point, one doing fundamental research ourselves

2479
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:19,770
and then two working with all the great researchers, working with all the great industries, the feedback system is incredible.

2480
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,650
and then finally, you just have to have a culture of staying super alert.

2481
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:29,690
there's no easy way of being alert except for paying attention.

2482
02:02:31,199 --> 02:02:36,969
i haven't found a single way of being able to stay alert without paying attention. and so, you know,

2483
02:02:36,979 --> 02:02:39,530
i probably read several thousand emails a day.

2484
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:45,369
> > how how do you have a time for that? > > i wake up early.

2485
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:46,889
this morning i was up at 4 : 00.

2486
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:52,250
> > how much do you sleep? > > uh, six, seven, six, seven hours.

2487
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:53,290
> > yeah.

2488
02:02:54,159 --> 02:02:57,849
> > and then you're up at 4 reading emails for a few hours before you get going.

2489
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:58,409
> > that's right.

2490
02:02:58,419 --> 02:02:58,650
yeah.

2491
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:02,250
> > wow. every day. > > every single day.

2492
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:06,810
not one day missed. [sighs] including thanksgiving, christmas.

2493
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:09,849
> > do you ever take a vacation? > > uh,

2494
02:03:10,159 --> 02:03:10,409
yeah.

2495
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:10,889
but they're

2496
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:11,849
um

2497
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:14,969
my definition of a vacation is when i'm with my family.

2498
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:19,449
and so if i'm with my family, i'm very happy. i don't care where we are.

2499
02:03:19,459 --> 02:03:20,489
> > and you don't work then

2500
02:03:20,499 --> 02:03:21,770
or do you work a little? > > no.

2501
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:21,929
no.

2502
02:03:21,939 --> 02:03:27,849
i work a lot. [laughter] > > even like if you go on a trip somewhere, you're still working.

2503
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,570
> > oh, sure.

2504
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:29,290
oh, sure.

2505
02:03:29,440 --> 02:03:31,050
> > wow. every day. > > every day.

2506
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:33,050
> > but my kids work every

2507
02:03:33,199 --> 02:03:34,650
you make me tired just saying this.

2508
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:39,210
> > my kids work every day. both of my kids work at nvidia.

2509
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:40,090
they work every day.

2510
02:03:40,239 --> 02:03:40,489
> > wow.

2511
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,969
> > yeah. i'm very lucky. > > wow.

2512
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:43,690
> > yeah.

2513
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,650
it's brutal now

2514
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:45,929
because, you know,

2515
02:03:45,939 --> 02:03:48,810
it's just me working every day. now we have three people working every day

2516
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,050
and they want to work with me every day

2517
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,130
and so it's it's a lot of work.

2518
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:58,170
> > well, you've obviously imparted that ethic into them.

2519
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,570
> > they work incredibly hard. i mean, there's no unbelievable.

2520
02:04:01,840 --> 02:04:05,290
> > but my parents work incredibly hard. > > yeah.

2521
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:05,929
i was

2522
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:11,770
i was born with the work gene, > > the suffering gene. [laughter] > > well, listen, man.

2523
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:19,530
it has paid off. what a crazy story. it was just it's really an amazing origin story. it really

2524
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,290
i mean, it has to be kind of surreal to be in the position that you're in now

2525
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:27,449
when you look back at how many times that it could have fallen apart and humble beginnings.

2526
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:28,810
but joe,

2527
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,369
this is great.

2528
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:30,250
it's a great country.

2529
02:04:30,880 --> 02:04:37,530
you know, i'm an immigrant. my parents sent my older brother and i here first. we're

2530
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:44,409
we're in thailand. i was born in taiwan, but my dad had a job in thailand.

2531
02:04:44,800 --> 02:04:48,889
he was a chemical and instrumentation engineer, incredible engineer.

2532
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:52,330
and his job was to go start an oil refinery.

2533
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:57,050
and so we moved to thailand, lived in bangkok. and um

2534
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:58,409
in 19

2535
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:00,969
i guess

2536
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:01,530
1973

2537
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:02,409
1974

2538
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:03,369
time frame,

2539
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:05,849
you know how

2540
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,170
thailand

2541
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:06,969
every so often

2542
02:05:06,979 --> 02:05:08,810
they would just have a coup. you know,

2543
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:10,489
the military would have an uprising

2544
02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:15,130
and all of a sudden one day there were tanks and soldiers in the streets

2545
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:18,889
and my parents thought, you know, it probably isn't safe for the kids to be here.

2546
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:26,170
and so they contacted my uncle. my uncle lives in tacoma, washington. and um

2547
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:30,250
we had never met him and my parents sent us to him.

2548
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,010
> > how old were you? > >

2549
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:32,010
uh

2550
02:05:32,239 --> 02:05:35,690
i was about to turn nine and my older brother

2551
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:36,409
uh

2552
02:05:36,719 --> 02:05:37,610
almost turned 11

2553
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:41,610
and so the two of us came to united states

2554
02:05:42,239 --> 02:05:47,929
and we stayed in with our uncle for a little bit while he looked for a school for us

2555
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:50,889
and my parents didn't have very much money

2556
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,650
and they never been to united states. my father was.

2557
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:56,330
i'll tell you that story in a second.

2558
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:58,489
and um

2559
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:09,610
and so my my uncle found a school that would accept foreign students and affordable enough for my parents.

2560
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:11,849
and

2561
02:06:11,859 --> 02:06:20,489
that school turned out to have been in onita, kentucky, clark county, kentucky, the epicenter of the opio crisis today.

2562
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:31,849
cold country. clark county, kentucky is was the poorest county in america when i showed up.

2563
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,409
it is the poorest county in america today.

2564
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:39,770
and so we went to the school, it's a great school, um,

2565
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:45,530
onita baptist institute in a town of a few hundred.

2566
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:52,650
i think it was 600 at the time that we showed up. no traffic light. and um

2567
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:56,170
i think it has 600 today. it's quite an amazing feat actually.

2568
02:06:58,960 --> 02:07:04,489
the ability to hold your population for [laughter] when it's 600 people. it was quite a magic

2569
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:07,290
quite a magical thing. however they did it.

2570
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:09,050
and and so

2571
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:10,170
uh

2572
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:18,889
the school had a mission of being an open school for any children who would like to come.

2573
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:26,650
and what that basically means is that if you're a trouble student, if you have a troubled family,

2574
02:07:28,079 --> 02:07:28,329
um

2575
02:07:29,040 --> 02:07:32,570
if you're, you know,

2576
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,250
whatever your background,

2577
02:07:35,679 --> 02:07:44,090
you're welcome to come to onita baptist institute, including kids from international who would like to stay there.

2578
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:46,090
> > did you speak english at the time? > > uh,

2579
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:46,650
okay.

2580
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:47,290
yeah.

2581
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:49,210
yeah. okay. yeah.

2582
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:53,929
and so we showed up and

2583
02:07:54,239 --> 02:07:54,489
uh

2584
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:00,329
my first my first thought was gosh

2585
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:03,210
there are a lot of cigarette butts on the ground.

2586
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,010
100 % of the kids smoked. [laughter] so right away

2587
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:12,889
you know this is not a normal school. > > nineyear-olds? > > no,

2588
02:08:12,899 --> 02:08:14,010
i was the youngest kid.

2589
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:19,449
> > okay. 11 year olds. > > my roommate was 17 years old. wow. > > yeah.

2590
02:08:19,459 --> 02:08:25,210
he just turned 17. and he was jacked and and um

2591
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:30,489
i don't know where he is now.

2592
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:32,889
i know his name, but i don't know where he is now. but anyways,

2593
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:33,929
uh

2594
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:35,610
that night we got

2595
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:42,090
and and the second thing i noticed when you walk into the into your dorm room is

2596
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:42,570
uh

2597
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:44,650
there are no drawers and no closet doors.

2598
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,889
just like a prison.

2599
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:57,130
and there are no locks so that people could check check up on you.

2600
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:02,090
and so i go into my room and he's 17

2601
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:02,969
and

2602
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:03,530
uh

2603
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:04,250
you know

2604
02:09:04,260 --> 02:09:10,170
get ready for for bed and he had all this tape all over his body

2605
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:11,210
and

2606
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:11,610
uh

2607
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:17,449
turned out he was in a knife fight and he's been stabbed all over his body

2608
02:09:17,459 --> 02:09:19,690
and these were just fresh wounds. > > whoa.

2609
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:25,050
and the other kids were hurt much worse. and uh

2610
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:29,929
so he was my roommate, the toughest kid in school, and i was the youngest kid in school.

2611
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:31,369
it was a

2612
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:36,010
it was a junior high, but they took me anyways

2613
02:09:37,119 --> 02:09:46,650
because if i walked about a mile across the kentucky river, the swing bridge, the other side is a middle school

2614
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:47,690
that i could go to

2615
02:09:47,920 --> 02:09:52,810
and then i can go to that school and i come back and then i stay in the dorm.

2616
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:58,090
and so basically onita baptist institute was my dorm when i went to this other other school.

2617
02:09:58,880 --> 02:10:00,810
my older brother went went to um

2618
02:10:00,820 --> 02:10:05,050
went to the junior high. and so we were there for a couple of years. um

2619
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:06,489
every kid had

2620
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:13,530
every kid had chores. my older brother's chore was to work in the tobacco farm, you know.

2621
02:10:13,540 --> 02:10:14,010
so tobac

2622
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:17,369
they raised tobacco so that they could raise some extra money for the school.

2623
02:10:18,079 --> 02:10:18,889
kind of like a penitentiary.

2624
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:20,170
> > wow.

2625
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:22,409
and my job was just to clean the dorm.

2626
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:25,369
and so i i was 9 years old.

2627
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:26,810
i was cleaning toilets.

2628
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:34,810
and for a dorm of 100 100 boys, i i clean more bathrooms than anybody.

2629
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:38,329
and i just wish that everybody was a little bit more careful, you know.

2630
02:10:38,339 --> 02:10:47,210
[laughter] but anyways, i was the youngest kid in school. the my memories of it was really good. um,

2631
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,369
but it was a pretty tough

2632
02:10:49,379 --> 02:10:52,969
it was a tough town. > > sounds like it. > > yeah. town kids, they all carried

2633
02:10:53,119 --> 02:10:53,770
everybody had knives.

2634
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:55,849
> > everybody had knives.

2635
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:57,690
everybody smoked.

2636
02:10:58,239 --> 02:11:02,650
everybody had a zippo lighter. i smoked for a week. > > did you? > > oh, yeah.

2637
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:02,810
sure.

2638
02:11:02,880 --> 02:11:04,250
> > how old were you? > > i was nine. yeah.

2639
02:11:04,260 --> 02:11:04,810
> > when you nine?

2640
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:06,090
you were nine, you tried smoking.

2641
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:06,650
> > yeah.

2642
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:11,050
i got myself a pack of cigarettes. everybody else did. > > did you get sick? no.

2643
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:12,810
i i got used to it, you know,

2644
02:11:12,820 --> 02:11:16,969
and i learned how to blow blow smoke rings and, you know,

2645
02:11:16,979 --> 02:11:19,449
[snorts] you know,

2646
02:11:19,459 --> 02:11:20,730
breathe out of my nose, you know,

2647
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:22,650
take it in out of through my nose.

2648
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:24,889
i mean, there was a all the different things that you learned.

2649
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:25,849
yeah.

2650
02:11:26,159 --> 02:11:26,730
> > at nine.

2651
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:27,530
> > yeah.

2652
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:30,329
> > wow. you just did it to fit in or it looked cool. > > yeah.

2653
02:11:30,339 --> 02:11:30,329
[clears throat]

2654
02:11:30,339 --> 02:11:31,929
because everybody else did it, > > right? > > yeah.

2655
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:35,290
and and then i did it for a couple weeks, i guess.

2656
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:39,530
and i just rather have i had a quarter,

2657
02:11:40,239 --> 02:11:40,650
you know,

2658
02:11:40,960 --> 02:11:42,090
i had a quarter a month

2659
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:48,329
or something like that. i just rather buy popsicles and fried sickles with it. i was nine, you know,

2660
02:11:48,561 --> 02:11:49,610
[laughter] > > right? > > i chose

2661
02:11:49,679 --> 02:11:52,489
i chose the the better path. > > wow.

2662
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:56,730
> > that was our school. and then my parents came to united states two years later

2663
02:11:57,360 --> 02:11:57,610
and

2664
02:11:57,920 --> 02:11:58,170
um

2665
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:00,329
we met him in tacoma, washington.

2666
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:02,489
> > that's wild.

2667
02:12:03,199 --> 02:12:04,969
it it was a really crazy experience.

2668
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:11,050
what a strange formative experience. > > yeah. tough kids. > > thailand

2669
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:20,250
to one of the poorest places in america or if not the poorest as a 9-year-old. > > yeah.

2670
02:12:20,260 --> 02:12:24,489
it was my first experience with your brother. > > wow. > > yeah. yeah.

2671
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:25,130
no,

2672
02:12:25,140 --> 02:12:26,010
i i remember

2673
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,690
and what breaks my heart

2674
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:28,969
probably the only thing

2675
02:12:28,979 --> 02:12:32,409
that really breaks my heart of about

2676
02:12:32,419 --> 02:12:41,770
that experience was so we didn't have enough money to make you know international phone calls every week

2677
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:44,969
and so my parents gave us this tape deck

2678
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,290
this iowa tape deck and a tape

2679
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:55,290
and so every month we would sit in front on that tape deck

2680
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:56,570
and that my older brother jeff

2681
02:12:56,580 --> 02:13:03,690
and i, the two of us would just tell them what we did the whole month.

2682
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:05,130
> > wow.

2683
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:07,369
> > and we would send that tape

2684
02:13:07,379 --> 02:13:07,849
by mail

2685
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:10,889
and my parents would take that tape

2686
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:14,650
and record back on top of it and send it back to us.

2687
02:13:17,119 --> 02:13:17,369
> > wow.

2688
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:18,570
> > could you imagine if

2689
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:19,210
for two years

2690
02:13:20,159 --> 02:13:20,409
> > wow.

2691
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:27,770
is that tape still existed of these two kids just describing their first experience with united states.

2692
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:32,409
like i remember telling my parents that that

2693
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,050
uh

2694
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:36,090
i joined the swim team and

2695
02:13:37,840 --> 02:13:38,090
uh

2696
02:13:40,239 --> 02:13:41,690
my roommate was really buff

2697
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:44,969
and so every day we spent a lot of time in the in the gym

2698
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:45,929
and so

2699
02:13:46,159 --> 02:13:46,409
uh

2700
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:47,130
uh

2701
02:13:47,140 --> 02:13:47,610
every night

2702
02:13:47,760 --> 02:13:49,929
100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups every day

2703
02:13:49,939 --> 02:13:50,329
in the gym.

2704
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:52,010
so, i was nine years old. i was getting

2705
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:55,290
i was pretty buff and i'm pretty fit.

2706
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:56,329
and uh

2707
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:01,369
and so i joined the soccer team. i joined the swim team

2708
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:05,849
because if you join the team, they take you to meets

2709
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,489
and then afterwards you get to go to a nice restaurant.

2710
02:14:09,119 --> 02:14:10,810
and that nice restaurant was mcdonald's.

2711
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,010
> > wow.

2712
02:14:12,400 --> 02:14:12,650
> >

2713
02:14:12,660 --> 02:14:15,369
and and i recorded this thing.

2714
02:14:15,379 --> 02:14:19,130
and i said, " mom and dad, we went to the most amazing restaurant today.

2715
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:22,170
this whole place is lit up.

2716
02:14:22,239 --> 02:14:23,050
it's like the future.

2717
02:14:23,060 --> 02:14:32,650
" and [snorts] the food comes in a box [laughter] and the food is incredible.

2718
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:37,369
the hamburger is incredible. it was mcdonald's. [snorts] but anyhow, it

2719
02:14:37,379 --> 02:14:39,449
it wouldn't it be amazing? > > oh my god.

2720
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:40,409
two years recording.

2721
02:14:40,719 --> 02:14:40,969
yeah.

2722
02:14:40,979 --> 02:14:41,929
two years. yeah.

2723
02:14:42,239 --> 02:14:48,650
what a crazy connection to your parents, too. just sending a tape and them sending you one back

2724
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:51,290
and it's the only way you're communicating for two years. > > yeah.

2725
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:52,730
wow.

2726
02:14:53,679 --> 02:14:53,929
yeah.

2727
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:54,730
no,

2728
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:55,130
i've

2729
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:56,250
my parents are incredible

2730
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:56,730
actually.

2731
02:14:56,800 --> 02:14:58,250
they're just they're

2732
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:58,810
uh

2733
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:00,570
they grew up really poor

2734
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:02,090
and um

2735
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:04,570
when they came to united states, they had almost no money.

2736
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:05,530
uh

2737
02:15:06,159 --> 02:15:10,650
probably one of the most impactful memories i have is

2738
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:11,050
is

2739
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:11,690
uh

2740
02:15:11,700 --> 02:15:11,849
we

2741
02:15:12,159 --> 02:15:13,290
they came and we were

2742
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:14,250
we were staying in a

2743
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:14,810
in a

2744
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:15,210
in a

2745
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:15,530
uh

2746
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:22,090
apartment complex and they had

2747
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,090
they had just rent back in the

2748
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:25,849
i guess people still do rent rent

2749
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:32,810
a bunch of furniture and we were messing around

2750
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:36,570
and

2751
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:37,130
uh

2752
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,130
we bumped into the coffee table and crushed it.

2753
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:48,810
it's made out of particle wood and we crushed it. and i just still remember my

2754
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:50,889
the look on my mom's face, you know,

2755
02:15:50,899 --> 02:15:53,929
because they didn't have any money and she didn't know how she was going to pay it back.

2756
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:59,210
and but anyhow, that's that kind of tells you how hard it was for them to come here.

2757
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:00,969
they they left everything behind

2758
02:16:01,360 --> 02:16:02,969
and all they had was their suitcase

2759
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:07,690
and the money they had in their in their pocket and they came to united states.

2760
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,130
> > how old were they pursued the american dream? they were in their 40s. > > wow.

2761
02:16:11,199 --> 02:16:11,449
> > yeah.

2762
02:16:11,459 --> 02:16:15,210
late late 30s. > > pursued the american dream. this is

2763
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:16,570
this is the american dream.

2764
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:19,050
i'm the first generation of the american dream.

2765
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:19,690
> > wow.

2766
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:20,650
> > yeah.

2767
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:22,170
it's hard not to love this country.

2768
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,929
> > that's > > it's it's hard not to be romantic about this country.

2769
02:16:26,079 --> 02:16:29,610
> > that is a romantic story. that's an amazing story. > > yeah.

2770
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:33,049
and and my dad found his job literally in the newspaper,

2771
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:34,888
you know,

2772
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:40,648
the ads and he calls people. got a job. > > what did he do? > >

2773
02:16:40,659 --> 02:16:40,648
uh

2774
02:16:40,659 --> 02:16:41,849
he was a consulting engineer

2775
02:16:42,879 --> 02:16:49,929
and a and a consulting firm and they helped people build oil refineries, paper mills and fabs.

2776
02:16:50,398 --> 02:16:52,490
and that's what he did. he was an he

2777
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:54,410
he's really good at factory design

2778
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:57,049
instrumentation engineer.

2779
02:16:57,439 --> 02:16:59,209
and so he's

2780
02:16:59,219 --> 02:17:00,410
he's brilliant at that.

2781
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:01,450
and so he did that

2782
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,049
and my mom

2783
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:03,849
uh

2784
02:17:03,859 --> 02:17:04,568
worked as a maid

2785
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:05,290
and

2786
02:17:05,599 --> 02:17:05,849
uh

2787
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:07,769
they found a way to raise us.

2788
02:17:08,879 --> 02:17:09,129
> > wow.

2789
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:11,849
that's an incredible story, jensen.

2790
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:13,049
it really is.

2791
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:22,968
every all of it from your childhood to the perils of nvidia almost falling. [laughter] it's really incredible, man.

2792
02:17:22,978 --> 02:17:24,250
> > it's a great story. yeah.

2793
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:25,769
i i've lived a great life.

2794
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:30,490
> > you really have. and it's a great story for other people to hear, too. it really is.

2795
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:31,370
> > you don't

2796
02:17:31,379 --> 02:17:34,170
you don't have to go to ivy league schools to succeed.

2797
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:37,370
this country creates opportunities.

2798
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,370
has opportunities for all of us.

2799
02:17:40,318 --> 02:17:41,290
you do have to strive.

2800
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:44,330
you have to claw your way here.

2801

> > yeah. > > but if you put in the work, you can succeed. nobody works with

2805
02:17:57,779 --> 02:18:01,450
you and i spoke about two two people who are very dear to me. um

2806
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:04,490
but the list goes on. the people

2807
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:06,648
the people at nvidia who have

2808
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:06,968
have

2809
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:07,450
uh

2810
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:08,330
helped me

2811
02:18:09,519 --> 02:18:09,769
um

2812
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:10,410
uh

2813
02:18:10,420 --> 02:18:11,769
many friends that are on the board

2814
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:13,129
uh

2815
02:18:13,139 --> 02:18:13,530
the decisions

2816
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:14,568
you know

2817
02:18:14,579 --> 02:18:14,808
them

2818
02:18:14,818 --> 02:18:15,849
giving me the opportunity

2819
02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:18,410
like when we were inventing this new computing approach

2820
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:24,330
i tanked our stock price because we added this thing called cuda to the chip

2821
02:18:24,638 --> 02:18:25,450
we had this big idea

2822
02:18:25,599 --> 02:18:27,209
we added this thing called cuda to the chip

2823
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:29,049
but nobody paid for it

2824
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,090
but our cost doubled

2825
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:37,609
and so we had this graphics chip company and we invented gpus, we invented programmable shaders,

2826
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,090
we invented everything modern computer graphics,

2827
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:44,010
we invented real-time tracing.

2828
02:18:44,638 --> 02:18:46,648
that's why it went from gtx to rtx.

2829
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:56,410
we invented all this stuff, but every time we invented something, the market doesn't know how to appreciate it, but the cost went way up.

2830
02:18:56,879 --> 02:19:02,490
and in the case of cuda that enabled ai, the cost increased a lot. it

2831
02:19:02,879 --> 02:19:03,129
and

2832
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:05,209
but i really we really believed it

2833
02:19:05,840 --> 02:19:06,250
you know

2834
02:19:06,260 --> 02:19:10,490
and so if you believe in that future and you don't do anything about it

2835
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:11,849
you're going to regret it for your life

2836
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:14,410
and so we always

2837
02:19:14,558 --> 02:19:14,968
you know

2838
02:19:14,978 --> 02:19:15,769
i always tell the team

2839
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:16,568
do you believe

2840
02:19:16,579 --> 02:19:18,170
what do we believe this or not

2841
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:22,170
and if you believe it and so grounded on first principle is not random

2842
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:23,450
you know

2843
02:19:23,459 --> 02:19:23,609
hearsay

2844
02:19:24,638 --> 02:19:25,609
and we believe it

2845
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:26,410
we've got to

2846
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:28,090
we owe it to ourselves to go pursue it

2847
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:30,490
if we're the right people to go do it

2848
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:33,769
if it's really really hard to do. it's worth doing and we believe it.

2849
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:39,929
let's go pursue it. well, we pursued it. we we launched the product. nobody knew.

2850
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:40,888
it was exactly what

2851
02:19:40,898 --> 02:19:46,250
like when i launched dgx1 and the entire audience was like complete silence.

2852
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,170
when i launched cuda,

2853
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,890
the audience was complete silence.

2854
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:53,050
no customer wanted it.

2855
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:55,210
nobody asked for it.

2856
02:19:56,080 --> 02:20:01,050
nobody understood it. nvidia was a public company. > > what year was this? this is

2857
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:01,450
uh

2858
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:02,970
uh

2859
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:04,410
let's see 200

2860
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:06,090
2006

2861
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:08,490
20 years ago

2862
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:11,130
2005.

2863
02:20:12,319 --> 02:20:15,370
> > wow. > > our stock price just went

2864
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:22,490

02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:26,330
> > from > > from about 12 or something like that.

2866
02:20:28,319 --> 02:20:29,290
i crushed it.

2867
02:20:29,947 --> 02:20:31,770
> > [laughter] > > in a very bad way.

2868

2869
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:35,609
yeah,

2870
02:20:35,619 --> 02:20:36,170
it's higher.

2871
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:39,930
[laughter] > > very humble of you.

2872

2874
02:20:46,399 --> 02:20:47,609
it's an incredible story, johnson.

2875
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:48,810
it really is.

2876
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:51,130
> > thank you.

2877
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:51,930

2878
02:20:51,940 --> 02:20:58,010
it's incredible. ah, > > my story is not as incredible. my story is more weird, you know.

2879
02:20:59,359 --> 02:21:01,050
it's much more fertuitous and weird.

2880
02:21:01,439 --> 02:21:06,250
> > okay. what are the three milestones that most important milestones that led to here?

2881
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:11,689

2882
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:17,689
um, > > what was step one? > > i think step one was seeing other people do it.

2883
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:22,330
step one was in the initial days of podcasting, like in 2009

2884
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:26,890
when i started, podcasting had only been around for a couple of years.

2885
02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:27,689
um,

2886
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:31,290
the first was adam curry, my good friend, who was the podfather.

2887
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:32,890
he he invented podcasting.

2888
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,210
and then, you know,

2889
02:21:35,439 --> 02:21:35,689
um,

2890
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:36,649
i remember

2891
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:39,290
adam corolla had a show because he had a radio show.

2892
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:40,569
his radio show got cancelled

2893
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:43,609
and so he decided to just do the same show but do it on the internet.

2894
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:45,850
and that was pretty revolutionary. nobody was doing that.

2895
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:51,770
and then there was the experience that i had had doing different morning radio shows like opie

2896
02:21:51,780 --> 02:21:52,970
and anthony in particular

2897
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:57,210
because it was fun and we would just get together with a bunch of comedians,

2898
02:21:58,399 --> 02:21:58,810
you know,

2899
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:01,290
i'd be on the show with like three or four other guys that i knew

2900
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:03,770
and it was always just looked forward to it.

2901
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:05,770
it was was just such a good time

2902
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:07,770
and i said, " god, i miss doing that.

2903
02:22:07,780 --> 02:22:08,569
it's so fun to do that.

2904
02:22:08,579 --> 02:22:12,250
i wish i could do something like that. " and then i saw tom green setup.

2905
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:14,250
tom green had a setup in his house

2906
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:18,010
and he essentially turned his entire house into a television studio

2907
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:21,050
and he did an internet show from his living room.

2908
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:25,050
he had servers in his house and cables everywhere. had to step over cables. i was

2909
02:22:25,060 --> 02:22:25,689
this is like 2007.

2910
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:26,569
i'm like tom

2911
02:22:26,579 --> 02:22:27,770
this is nuts. like this is

2912
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:30,569
> > and i'm like you got to figure out a way to make money from this. like this

2913
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:31,290
everybody

2914
02:22:31,520 --> 02:22:33,930
i wish everybody in the internet could see your setup.

2915
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:35,850
it's nuts. i just want to let you guys know that

2916
02:22:35,860 --> 02:22:38,569
[laughter] > > it's not just this.

2917
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:39,370
> > yeah.

2918
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:43,050
so that was the the beginning of it is just seeing other people do it

2919
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:44,170
and then saying all right

2920
02:22:44,180 --> 02:22:44,890
let's just try it

2921
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:45,370
and then

2922
02:22:45,380 --> 02:22:46,410
so the beginning days

2923
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:48,010
we just did it on a laptop

2924
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:51,530
had a laptop with a webcam and just messed around

2925
02:22:51,600 --> 02:22:52,970
had a bunch of comedians come in

2926
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:56,649
we would just talk and joke around and i did it like once a week

2927
02:22:56,720 --> 02:22:58,569
and then i started doing it twice a week

2928
02:22:58,720 --> 02:23:00,890
and then all a sudden i was doing it for a year

2929
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,330
and then i was doing it for two years

2930
02:23:02,479 --> 02:23:03,210
then it was like

2931
02:23:03,220 --> 02:23:03,450
oh

2932
02:23:03,460 --> 02:23:04,890
it's starting to get a lot of viewers

2933
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:06,170
a lot of listeners

2934
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:07,290
you know

2935
02:23:07,300 --> 02:23:09,050
and then i just kept doing

2936
02:23:09,439 --> 02:23:09,689
it's

2937
02:23:09,699 --> 02:23:10,250
all it is.

2938
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:15,450
i just kept doing it because i enjoyed doing it. well, was there any setback? > > no.

2939
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:16,090
no,

2940
02:23:16,100 --> 02:23:17,770
there was never really a setback really. > > no,

2941

2943
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:23,770

2944
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:24,250
no.

2945
02:23:24,319 --> 02:23:24,569
no.

2946
02:23:24,579 --> 02:23:24,810
no.

2947
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:26,010
it wasn't tough or hard.

2948
02:23:26,240 --> 02:23:27,130
it was just interesting.

2949
02:23:27,359 --> 02:23:31,050
so, i just it the the > > you were never once punched in the face. > > no,

2950
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:31,770
not in the show.

2951
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:32,090
no,

2952
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:32,569
not really.

2953
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:33,930
not not doing the show.

2954
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:38,810
> > you never did something that that big blowback. nope.

2955
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:40,569
not really.

2956
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:42,729
no, it all just kept growing.

2957
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:47,689
> > it kept growing and the thing stayed the same from the beginning to now.

2958
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,729
and the thing is, i enjoy talking to people.

2959
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:52,410
i've always enjoyed talking to interesting people.

2960
02:23:52,420 --> 02:23:53,210
> > i could even tell just

2961
02:23:53,220 --> 02:23:56,569
when we walked in, the way you interacted with everybody, not just me.

2962
02:23:57,359 --> 02:23:58,330
> > yeah, that's cool.

2963
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,170
> > people are cool. > > yeah, that's cool.

2964
02:24:00,319 --> 02:24:01,290
you know, i i

2965
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:08,090
it's a an amazing gift to be able to have so many conversations with so many interesting people

2966
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:10,729
because it changes the way you see the world

2967
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:13,530
because you see the world through so many different people's eyes

2968
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,770
and you have so many different people

2969
02:24:15,780 --> 02:24:21,130
have different perspectives and different opinions and different philosophies and different life stories.

2970
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:31,370
and you know, it's an incredibly enriching and educating experience having so many conversations with so many amazing people.

2971
02:24:32,319 --> 02:24:35,370
and that's all i started doing.

2972
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:36,729
and that's all i do now.

2973
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:40,330
even now, when i booked the show, i do it on my phone.

2974
02:24:40,800 --> 02:24:45,290
and i basically go through this giant list of emails of all the people

2975
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:46,410
that want to be on the show

2976
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:48,170
or that request to be on the show.

2977
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,170
and then i factor in another list

2978
02:24:50,180 --> 02:24:53,370
that i have of people that i would like to get on the show that i'm interested in.

2979
02:24:53,600 --> 02:24:56,330
and i just map it out and that's it.

2980
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:57,770
and i go, " oh, i'd like to talk to him.

2981
02:24:57,780 --> 02:24:59,450
" > > if it wasn't because of president trump,

2982
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:02,090
i wouldn't have been bumped up on that list. [laughter] > > no,

2983
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:03,210
i wanted to talk to you already.

2984
02:25:03,760 --> 02:25:06,810
i i just think, you know, what you're doing is very fascinating.

2985
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:08,810
i mean, how would i not want to talk to you?

2986
02:25:08,820 --> 02:25:12,810
and then today, it proved to be absolutely the right decision. > > well,

2987
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:13,290
you know,

2988
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:13,850
listen,

2989
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:14,170
it's

2990
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:17,210
it's strange to be an immigrant one day.

2991
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:23,530
going to onita baptist institute with with the students that were there

2992
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:25,050
and then here

2993
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:31,050
nvidia's one of the most consequential companies in the history of companies.

2994
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:36,729
> > it is a crazy story. > > it has to be that journey is

2995
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:37,370
is a

2996
02:25:37,380 --> 02:25:40,490
and it's very humbling and > > and um

2997
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:41,370
i'm very grateful.

2998
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:45,850
> > it's pretty amazing man. > > surrounded by amazing people. you're very fortunate and you've also

2999
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:50,490
you seem very happy and you seem like you're 100 % on the right path in this life.

3000
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:51,370
you know,

3001
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:51,930
> >

3002
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:52,090
you know,

3003
02:25:52,479 --> 02:25:56,729
everybody says you must love your job. not every day. [laughter] > > that's not

3004
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:01,050
that's part of the beauty of everything is that there's ups and downs.

3005
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:04,330
it's never just like this giant dopamine high. > > we leave

3006
02:26:04,399 --> 02:26:09,210
we leave this impression here. here's here's an impression i don't think is healthy. we

3007
02:26:09,220 --> 02:26:09,450
we

3008
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:10,810
um

3009
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:12,410
people who are successful

3010
02:26:12,560 --> 02:26:18,410
leave the impression often that that our job gives us great joy.

3011
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:27,770
i think largely it does that our jobs were passionate about our work. um

3012
02:26:27,780 --> 02:26:29,930
and that passion relates to

3013
02:26:30,319 --> 02:26:33,689
it's just so much fun. i think it largely is,

3014
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:36,970
but it it it distracts from

3015
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:37,689
in fact

3016
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:42,330
a lot of success comes from really really hard work.

3017
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:46,810
> > yes, > > there's long periods of suffering

3018
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:55,770
and loneliness and uncertainty and fear and embarrassment and humiliation.

3019
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:05,850
all of the feelings that we most not love that creating something from the ground up

3020
02:27:06,319 --> 02:27:08,410
and and elon will tell you something similar

3021
02:27:09,439 --> 02:27:11,850
very difficult to invent invent something new

3022
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:15,290
> > and people people don't believe you

3023
02:27:15,300 --> 02:27:15,850
all the time

3024
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:16,410
you're humiliated

3025
02:27:16,880 --> 02:27:19,450
often disbelieved most of the time

3026
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:23,530
and so so people forget that part of success

3027
02:27:24,240 --> 02:27:24,490
and

3028
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,410
and i i don't think it's health.

3029
02:27:26,640 --> 02:27:29,130
i think it's it's good that we pass that forward

3030
02:27:29,439 --> 02:27:32,330
and let people know that that it's just part of the journey.

3031
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:32,890
> > yes.

3032
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,250
> > suffering is part of the journey. > > you will appreciate it

3033
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:40,330
so these horrible feelings that you have when things are not going so well.

3034
02:27:40,479 --> 02:27:44,810
you will appreciate it so much more when they do go well. > > deeply grateful. > > yeah.

3035
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:45,530
> > yeah.

3036
02:27:45,680 --> 02:27:46,810
deep deep pride.

3037
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:48,810
incredible pride.

3038
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:53,850
in incredible incredible gratefulness and and and surely incredible memories.

3039
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:54,970
absolutely.

3040
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:57,370
jensen, thank you so much for being here.

3041
02:27:57,380 --> 02:27:58,170

3042
02:27:58,180 --> 02:27:59,130

3044
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:07,450
and very inspirational and and i you know, i think it really is the american dream.

3045
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:08,810
it is the american dream.

3046
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:15,252
