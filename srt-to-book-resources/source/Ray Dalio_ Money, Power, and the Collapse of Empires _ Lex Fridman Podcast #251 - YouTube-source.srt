1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
the following is a conversation with ray dalio

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,850
his second time on the podcast

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,330
he is a legendary investor

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,410
founder of bridgewater associates

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,969
author of a book i highly recommend

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,769
called principles

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,130
and also a new book called principles for dealing with a changing world order

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,770
that looks at the geopolitics of today

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,330
especially us and china

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,850
to the lens of history

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,490
providing a fascinating model for the rise

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,570
and fall of empires that can be applied to the analysis of our world

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:30,890
today

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,969
this is the lex friedman podcast to support it

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,730
please check out our sponsors in the description

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,809
and now here's my conversation with ray dalio

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,610
when you look at the history of the world as you have done in your new book

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,649
principles of dealing with the changing world order

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,410
what is more important

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:51,129
more

21
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:51,289
impactful

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,890
money or power

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,449
they go hand in hand

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,170
they support each other and they

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,570
um

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,090
compete with each other

27
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,090
those who have money

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,449
have power

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,970
a certain type of power

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:05,930
um

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,130
that power has to do with all that they can buy

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,890
but it also has the ability to influence those with political power

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,170
so

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:16,970
um

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,610
and

36
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,930
and so you see this throughout history

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,770
this symbiotic relationship

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,369
you know

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,770
um

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,729
for example

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,450
between

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,490
um

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,330
the royal families

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,250
the nobility and the church

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,090
so you see that group of people supporting each other in various ways

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,130
and then wrestling around with each other for the money and power among that group

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,369
so the dynamic that's quite classic is you could look at the parties in power back in

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,130
you know the 16th 17th centuries

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,570
you would look at

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,890
uh

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,170
royal families

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,250
nobles and um

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,770
and the church

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:04,890
if you're in europe

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,129
and then you would look at agricultural land and there was a certain dynamic

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,770
and that varies over time

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,170
it changes as those people get thrown out and technology changes

58
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,690
so when we evolved

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,730
when the society evolved so that it would produce goods and services

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,290
and you have something like the industrial revolution

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,970
the first industrial revolution

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,330
you have machines and you have the talent of people that are off the farms

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,890
and then you have a struggling for power

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,650
you see that power mix change

65
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,010
and so we don't see that same power mix anymore

66
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,890
but you still see the same dynamic

67
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,129
you see those with money

68
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,810
dealing with those who have political power around those assets that are considered most valuable to

69
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,409
particularly the productive assets that produce money

70
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,209
and political power is usually centered around nation state

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,810
so the major locus there's of power is the nations

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,090
yes

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,769
in 1668

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,530
after 30 years of war

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,370
there was the development of nation states

76
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,530
before then we had

77
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,250
it was really the development of countries

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,290
as we know it

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,129
that there were borders and that within those borders

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,170
uh

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,450
those who had control got to control it

82
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,690
and there was not to be intrusions in those borders

83
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,730
and that's how we established the nation state

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,769
and then

85
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:52,170
of course

86
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,530
within each country

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,370
there is levels

88
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,810
there is a central level

89
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,890
and then there is a typically a province or state level down below

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,810
and then there's a municipal level

91
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,930
so they each have different levels of power

92
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,529
and it's the coordination of those that determines how the country is run

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,370
you write that the quote archetypal big cycle governs the rising and declining empires and influences everything about them

94
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,290
including their currencies and markets

95
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,009
the most important three cycles are the ones you mentioned in the introduction

96
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,449
the long-term debt and capital market cycle

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,850
the internal order and disorder cycle and the external order and disorder cycle

98
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,889
can you describe this big cycle

99
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,050
there are two orders

100
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,449
there is an order by a sip order

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,250
i mean a system

102
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,410
how the system works

103
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,650
so there's an internal order

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,289
that is the internal governance system and it's usually set out in a constitution or some agreements

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,169
and then there's the world order

106
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,210
uh

107
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,250
how the world system

108
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:12,889
so

109
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:13,370
for example

110
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,090
in 1945

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,330
um

112
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,690
at the end of a war

113
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,850
which is basically a fight for determining the world order

114
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:22,889
um

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,250
the winners of the fight got together and created the world system

116
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,930
as we now know it

117
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,570
44

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,770
they created the brenton woods monetary system that determined the money pretty much

119
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,690
and because the united states won and had 80 percent of the world's money

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,889
gold was money then and had 80 of the world's gold

121
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,490
and it was half the world economy and it was the great military power

122
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,050
the order was built around an american world order

123
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,090
so that the united nations was in new york

124
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,569
the world bank and the imf were in washington and they built that new order

125
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,130
so classically

126
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,370
you have a war to determine whose rules we're following and then you have

127
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,009
um

128
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,009
the new water beings constructed after that

129
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,970
there is usually period of extended peace and prosperity

130
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,490
uh

131
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,090
peace suits prosperity

132
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,449
um

133
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,889
and so there's not

134
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,530
and the reason you have the peace is because no one wants to fight with the um dominant power

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,729
you know you're going to lose

136
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,210
you've surrendered

137
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,650
there's been the surrendering

138
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,250
they carve up the world

139
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,850
they say what it's going to look like

140
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,530
who's going to control what

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,770
and then you come into that period of of peace and then prosperity

142
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,330
where then there's uh

143
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,250
a working together

144
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,569
usually at that point you've wiped out a lot of the debt

145
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,250
you've wiped out a lot of the issues

146
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,250
the class warfare and so on

147
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,569
and then there's good working together

148
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,610
so those great periods um such as the industrial revolution in the late 1800s

149
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,889
or what we've experienced in the post-world war ii period are peaceful and prosperous periods led largely

150
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,569
by the dominant world power over a period of time

151
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,810
since really 1500

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,250
and maybe before but really 1500

153
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,729
when the dutch invented capitalism

154
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,289
and what i mean by that they invest

155
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,210
invented the first capital markets

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,090
the first stocks and the first stock market

157
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,130
um

158
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,569
that since then

159
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,729
capitalism has been an effective tool for building wealth because it got resources into the hands of inventive people

160
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,569
that's when we moved from agriculture to the importance of inventiveness of people

161
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,289
they got resources and then they built that prosperity in that process of doing that

162
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,530
they create wealth gaps

163
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,090
naturally

164
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,569
those who make a lot of money make a lot more and than those that don't

165
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,449
and it also produces opportunity gaps

166
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,410
because

167
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,449
uh

168
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,009
for example

169
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,690
those who earn a lot of money have that wealth

170
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,490
they have the power to educate their children in a way that others don't

171
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,769
and the gaps grow and also the debts grow at that time

172
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,250
when they go around the world with their competitiveness

173
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,930
they earn a lot of money

174
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,170
so

175
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:46,570
for example

176
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,209
the dutch

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,649
the dutch empire learned how to build ships

178
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,690
um

179
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,690
and that would go around the world

180
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,130
a key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle is the improvement of education and by education

181
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,690
i mean the skills that come from education

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,370
but also civility

183
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,130
the ability to deal with

184
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,850
well together

185
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,529
so the dutch invented ships that could go around the world and they had military power

186
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,050
but they were also very inventive

187
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:15,529
society

188
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,649
25 of the world's new inventions came from the dutch

189
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,769
and so

190
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,450
as they went around the world

191
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,130
they also brought their currency and they brought their military

192
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,890
they needed their

193
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,730
the currency they paid for things

194
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,290
um

195
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,250
and that currency

196
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,930
and then the more that happens

197
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,810
the more that becomes a reserve currency

198
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,690
and then they have their military

199
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,690
so they need their military strength

200
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,050
and so you see it evolve in all of those ways

201
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,370
but over a period of time

202
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,410
um

203
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,610
as they become more successful and more expensive

204
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:52,890
um

205
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,290
they became

206
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,490
they become more expensive

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:55,850
um

208
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,570
and and newer countries come along like um

209
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,209
the uk

210
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,410
um

211
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,370
then

212
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,850
uh

213
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,570
be learned to build ships from a lot

214
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,130
the dutch and could do that less expensively

215
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,209
and also

216
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,930
when they become more expensive

217
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,050
so less competitive

218
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,329
and also the work ethic begins to change

219
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,329
they believe that since they're richer

220
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,410
they can enjoy life more

221
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,490
they don't have to work quite as hard

222
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,130
and so you start to see the tilt

223
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,209
now you start to see the development of the top and

224
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:36,170
when you have a world reserve currency that allows you to borrow a lot of money

225
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,290
because those who want to save

226
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,529
want to hold your money

227
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,769
and that means that they'll lend you money

228
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,329
and so those countries get deeper into debt

229
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,850
so you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness and they

230
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,410
um

231
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,290
and they get themselves into financial circumstances

232
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,250
which are not good and they have large wealth gaps

233
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,529
which set the stage for downturns

234
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,769
and when they have downturns

235
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,130
um

236
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,570
the first question is

237
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,690
do they have enough money

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,850
and traditionally you know

239
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,170
uh

240
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,130
money is

241
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,089
is resources

242
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,290
um

243
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,209
so you classically see that the coffers are bare

244
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,410
that they're spending more money than their than they are earning

245
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,649
and they run out of money in the coffers and their granaries are empty rather than stocked

246
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,490
so that they give them the buffer

247
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,209
and as that deteriorates

248
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,370
that's that worsens conditions

249
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,010
and if they have a rival power

250
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,010
that's also challenging them

251
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,769
they see greater internal conflict over wealth

252
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,450
and then they have the problems internally and the problems externally

253
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,050
which usually results in an internal war

254
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,649
or an external war that leads to the change in the to the new world order

255
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,290
and to you

256
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,970
the dutch empire is a good example that

257
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,010
the british

258
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,850
what are some of the key examples that you think about in the book of this process

259
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,290
that follow the big cycle

260
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,410
well

261
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,329
the leading reserve currency empires

262
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,810
but it applies to all the empires

263
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,010
um

264
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:23,690
were the

265
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,410
the dutch

266
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:24,889
the british

267
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,450
uh

268
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,970
the american and the chinese

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,410
um

270
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:28,970
but

271
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:29,529
um

272
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,370
you could follow the same pattern

273
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:32,329
um

274
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,610
in the book i

275
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,329
it was very important for me to not just use words and concepts because that's subjective

276
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,810
it was very important for me to use actual measurements

277
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,490
so as you see

278
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:46,970
in the book

279
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,290
you can see every level of this

280
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,930
you can see

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,529
where is the education level

282
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,930
what is the military power

283
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,050
each one of those

284
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,410
and you could see them back going over the 500 years

285
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,690
and so

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,250
um

287
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,490
you can see the arcs and the composition of those arcs

288
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,930
and what you see is really in most countries

289
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,170
in most dynasties you can see that

290
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,649
but you also can see through those numbers

291
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,930
the health

292
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,730
um

293
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,170
of those countries today

294
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:17,209
um

295
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,089
there are

296
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,769
there are statistics that you could

297
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,570
that are in the book that show what is the level of education

298
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,850
what is the letter level of economic output

299
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,690
what is the level of um military strength

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,970
what is the level of a number of different measures of strength

301
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,370
so that you can then compare that

302
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,730
and i think that because there are objective measures of strength that you could see change

303
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,370
that shows the picture of where we are today

304
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,769
and i think one of the most important things about the book is

305
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:55,370
that it allows people to monitor how those things are transpiring

306
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,089
i think for policy makers

307
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,209
um

308
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:00,089
you know

309
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:02,570
are your policy policymakers doing a good job

310
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,690
and there's so much subjectivity in that

311
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,410
but i think it's very simple if those lines on the chart are improving

312
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,329
if your health index is improving

313
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,970
then you're moving toward a better life

314
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,130
so that's what the book works like

315
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,130
also it was used to create a model for the future

316
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,570
in other words

317
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,730
there are cause effect relationships

318
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,570
everything that happens has reasons

319
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,050
causes that preceded it

320
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,089
that made it happen

321
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,209
and so by having all those in numbers

322
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,610
one can see the probabilities of certain things happening

323
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,570
so

324
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,050
um

325
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,649
that's what

326
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,570
that's what you see in in the book

327
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,290
it's not just

328
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,250
you know

329
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,130
rey's interpretation

330
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,209
i didn't want to make it raise interpretation

331
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,290
because i don't know if i'm right

332
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:53,930
yeah

333
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,010
so one of the fascinating things in the book

334
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,690
so you have list these 18 measures

335
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,089
and there's like a little scorecard for the countries of the world today

336
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,449
so let's say u.

337
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:05,930
s china

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,690
and europe and what it was 20 years ago and looking at the change from 20 years ago

339
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,410
and that's another indicator to change itself to see where things are headed

340
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,370
maybe

341
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,490
can you comment on

342
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,570
from a score perspective

343
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,810
how is u. s and china

344
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,370
doing and in the 18 measures

345
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,610
what are some measures that stand out to you

346
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,810
is particularly important to think about today

347
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,690
for the united states

348
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,089
for china

349
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:33,529
well

350
00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:34,009
there are a number

351
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,490
um

352
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:35,930
financially

353
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,610
what you see in the united states is that

354
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,089
um

355
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,649
we're borrowing a lot more money

356
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,050
creating a lot of debt and we're

357
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:47,529
uh

358
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,810
printing a lot of money and our capacity to do that is very much is limited

359
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,690
first of all

360
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:55,930
because

361
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:56,889
um

362
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,610
when you

363
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,529
when there's a sale of a bond

364
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,250
when the government borrows more than it borrows money

365
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,089
because it spends more than it takes in

366
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:07,930
um

367
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,490
you have to sell a bond and the world right now has a lot of us dollar denominated bonds

368
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,410
because as the world's reserve currency

369
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,649
they sell sold on them

370
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,690
and they have very bad returns

371
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,690
negative real returns

372
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,570
negative

373
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,370
real returns

374
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:25,850
significantly

375
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,130
and so on

376
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:35,769
so that um means that more bonds has to be sold than um are bought

377
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:36,810
and

378
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,370
that means

379
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:46,089
that the federal reserve has is faced with the choice of having to raise the interest rate to curtail borrowing

380
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,370
which slows the economy and hurts the markets

381
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,649
or by filling that difference and producing money

382
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,610
the debt monetization

383
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,170
which produces an inflation in goods

384
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,490
services and financial assets

385
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,890
so in that regard

386
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,449
that's our the united states's position

387
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,689
in china's case

388
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,289
its balance of payments

389
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,089
um

390
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,689
is a better

391
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,730
um

392
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,890
china has displaced the united states as the world's largest trading country

393
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,089
in other words

394
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:25,369
more exports to other countries and as a result

395
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,410
it's economically competitive

396
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,530
but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency

397
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,970
it's a real blessing

398
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,730
so the united states

399
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,730
it has the world's reserve currency

400
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,490
but it is risking it because of this imbalance

401
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,090
so if you look at history

402
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,730
you see that those go slowly

403
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,450
but when they go eventually

404
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,490
they go quickly

405
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,370
so there's a risk of of of that financially

406
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,169
then there's the issue of

407
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,570
uh

408
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,610
internal order

409
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,090
so i'm just giving you the major ones

410
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,210
but i'll get into some of the other ones too right now

411
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:03,850
um

412
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,690
there's a lot of internal conflict in the united states

413
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,730
uh

414
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,010
which affects its

415
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,210
and um

416
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,890
how well it works

417
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,770
um

418
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,809
in china

419
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,410
there's less internal conflict because it's a more autocratic state

420
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:28,970
but also they've created this bifurcation of what is political and what is um economic

421
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,450
in terms of producing that prosperity

422
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,289
so if you stay out of the politics pretty much um

423
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,650
and then you're seeing um entrepreneurship

424
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,690
you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on

425
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,250
and so that internal working

426
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,210
um

427
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,169
you know that's subject to different people's

428
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,570
interpretations

429
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,410
whether they like it or not

430
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,570
but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds of measures is

431
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,610
is less sorry to pause on that for a second

432
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,730
so these measures

433
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,450
i guess you don't want to sort of um

434
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,530
romanticize any one measure or something like that

435
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,210
over interpret any one measure

436
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,370
but is internal conflict

437
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,250
always a bad thing is some

438
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,730
is this

439
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,049
uh

440
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,210
is it a complicated calculation

441
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,970
or do you kind of the way we think about these measures that you've presented

442
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,450
we should be thinking like the higher

443
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,410
the better

444
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,770
the lower worse

445
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,730
or i mean

446
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:26,970
of course

447
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,450
depending on

448
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:27,690
well

449
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,130
in many cases

450
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:42,890
the conflict that produces the revolution produces revolutionary changes that lead to resolutions that and lead to new starts

451
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,130
and so their short term

452
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,690
a short-term civil war is a hellacious experience

453
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,289
and at the same time it can be

454
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:55,850
um

455
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,330
the transition to a new beginning

456
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,530
um

457
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,570
also

458
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,169
there are different types of conflict

459
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,289
uh

460
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:03,929
competition

461
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,330
which makes things makes everything better

462
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,130
is

463
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,770
is a productive conflict

464
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,929
whereas destructive conflicts are not good over the short time

465
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,370
so you know that's how that those go

466
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:23,770
so

467
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:24,809
within each measure

468
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,010
the story is complicated

469
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:29,289
yeah

470
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,490
but my measures are are sort of clear meaning

471
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,730
how much political conflict

472
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,530
how much social conflict

473
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,210
in other words

474
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,250
you can measure conflict

475
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,450
you can measure fighting

476
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,010
you can measure crime rates

477
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,890
you can measure

478
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,010
um

479
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,130
lots of different ways of conflict

480
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,570
so the measures are a composite of different types of internal conflict

481
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,049
what are some other interesting measures

482
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,210
maybe if you can also mention

483
00:20:59,360 --> 00:20:59,610
like

484
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,169
for me

485
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,330
in particular interest is education and innovation

486
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,450
yes

487
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,370
the classic cycle

488
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,770
the most important leading indicator is the quality of education

489
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,770
most importantly

490
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,090
broad-based education

491
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:18,169
drawn as a from the largest population

492
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,809
because you can never tell who the talent is going to be

493
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,570
so where they're going to come from

494
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,210
so

495
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,530
for example

496
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,289
if you look at the chinese dynasties

497
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,210
the great chinese dynasties

498
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,490
um

499
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,169
and the confucian approach

500
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,049
it was meritocratic

501
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,770
of um

502
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,730
everybody could sit for exams and so

503
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,250
on broad base of drawing in the populations and you see that

504
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,370
if you go across societies

505
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,690
because that draws on the largest number of population to get education

506
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,610
and it also

507
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,330
um

508
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,530
that creates

509
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,250
um

510
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,450
a reality and a perception that the system is fairer

511
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:00,570
equal opportunity

512
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,490
not just one of privilege

513
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,210
and that helps to create social stability

514
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,890
but education is not just

515
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,530
uh

516
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,169
education in understanding facts and so on

517
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,330
it is education and um

518
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,570
civility of how to behave together

519
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,330
and so if they're smart

520
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,730
they understand how to be productive

521
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,409
because they work well together and they're productive

522
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,690
and then that leads to the next stage

523
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:30,730
you could see

524
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,330
in the lines in the charts

525
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,970
we i plotted these so that you could see in a typical cycle

526
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,610
you could see that education is the long leading indicator

527
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,610
and then you could see

528
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,770
as you mentioned that you

529
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,409
what you see is inventiveness and technology measures then follow

530
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,610
and you see

531
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,730
then also competitiveness in world markets

532
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,210
follows

533
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,250
for example

534
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,409
in the early stages of a cycle

535
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,610
the industries that they go into um

536
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,330
tend to be very basic industry

537
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,530
because they have cheap labor

538
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,250
something like textiles and simple manufactured goods

539
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:10,970
and so on

540
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,809
but as the education rises

541
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,370
then they move up the value chain to uh tech

542
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,610
greater technologies and so on

543
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,250
which raises incomes and raises productivity

544
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,610
so yes

545
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:23,929
those

546
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,330
and

547
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,130
and you know

548
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,929
as you say

549
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:28,010
there are 18 different measures like that

550
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:28,650
but education

551
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,450
um

552
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,090
and then civility and the inventiveness

553
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,730
so you see it reflected in in who's inventing what

554
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,690
um

555
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,730
and that corresponds

556
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,049
then who's trading with

557
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,370
who's a big trading country and where's the value of economic output and what are per capita incomes

558
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,289
they all follow those arcs

559
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,210
yeah

560
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,770
like you said

561
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,450
the fascinating thing about your book

562
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,330
so there's philosophy

563
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,210
there's wisdom

564
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,250
uh

565
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,370
but there's plots

566
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:58,809
yeah

567
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,929
you can see it

568
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,929
so it's not just your opinion

569
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,130
it's kind of like

570
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:03,370
uh

571
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,289
you can interpret it any way you like

572
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:05,929
uh

573
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,169
but you're just giving a lot of of your own insights along with the numbers

574
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,289
if you were to look at the american nation

575
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,210
the american empire and the trajectory is looking into the future

576
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:20,730
given these measures

577
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,730
what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse of the american empire

578
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,169
based on these measures

579
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,850
what are the concerning indicators

580
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,890
and if

581
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:31,610
um

582
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,130
if those break down further

583
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,169
what does that look like

584
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,690
well

585
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,090
all of those indicators are concerning

586
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,010
um

587
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,809
maybe except for one

588
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,250
which is technology

589
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,210
the technology niche

590
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:50,169
although

591
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,850
even in that area

592
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,409
the united states is improving at a slower rate than is china

593
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,370
for various advantages that they have there

594
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,409
they put out about eight times as many computer engineers

595
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:05,850
they have free data

596
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,970
and so on

597
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,409
but if you look at them so the financial is a is a concern

598
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,450
the internal order disorder is a concern

599
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,409
then if you look at education levels

600
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,049
the united states is in many way is is losing its educational advantage

601
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,210
if you were to look at

602
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,570
compare it with china

603
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,090
if you take general public education in the united states

604
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,770
it's deteriorated tremendously even in comparison to developed countries

605
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,010
there are scores pieces scores

606
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:44,730
and so on

607
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,130
and it's

608
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,450
you know

609
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,610
something like 38th in the world or something

610
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,049
and that was a big plunge

611
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,570
average public education

612
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,250
if you look at the best universities in the world

613
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,730
the united states is unique in having the best universities in the world

614
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,970
so there are these privileged spots

615
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,730
um that are

616
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,529
you know

617
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:03,850
excellent

618
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,210
uniquely

619
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:05,850
excellent

620
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,169
so when you look at the comparison

621
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,490
education in china is improving rapidly and it

622
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:21,049
and the quantity is a quantity of educated people in the areas that they're moving in

623
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,370
are

624
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,330
is is greater and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater

625
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:27,850
and so you see

626
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,970
the results are greater

627
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,010
um

628
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:30,730
but

629
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,130
um

630
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,330
it's sort of along the lines that i'm i'm dealing with

631
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,929
if you were to follow through in terms of um

632
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,690
actual productions

633
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:40,809
i i think

634
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,210
uh

635
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,450
you

636
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:41,929
you know

637
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,210
in terms of technologies

638
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,650
um

639
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,370
there are some areas that the united states is in a lead at the moment

640
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,289
there's some areas that china's in a lead

641
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,090
but china's gaining very quickly when i first went to china

642
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:56,690
1984

643
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,850
i would bring 10 calculators

644
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,570
and i gave them away as gifts to high ranking people and they thought they were miracle devices

645
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:07,929
um

646
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,289
right now

647
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,690
in terms of areas like quantum computing and a. i

648
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:14,409
and

649
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,049
and you know many areas

650
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,850
you have a race going on

651
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,010
and so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness

652
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,330
not just look at the current level

653
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,570
you have a situation where they're improving at a much faster rate

654
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,970
this is all good for the world

655
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,490
if the world can get along

656
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,250
and the main thing i think is

657
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,450
um

658
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,529
in just how do you have a healthy world and how do you have a strong economy

659
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,970
and how do you have a strong situation

660
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,330
is

661
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:48,809
be strong

662
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,130
the united states is

663
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,490
war is with itself

664
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,649
that's the main war

665
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,890
you know it's very simple in history

666
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,730
[music] be financially sound

667
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,570
earn more than you spend

668
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:03,770
um

669
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,330
and be strong in these ways and pretty much everything will take care of itself

670
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,490
but you make it sound simple

671
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:14,890
of course

672
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,730
because there's a momentum when things degrade when the education system degrades when you start borrowing

673
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:21,850
when

674
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,250
um

675
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,250
i mean all of these indicators once

676
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,529
once they start going down

677
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,250
it's

678
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:26,570
uh

679
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,169
there's a momentum to it right

680
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,330
so it's hard to reverse it right

681
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,649
and there are circumstances that you're then in

682
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,450
uh

683
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,010
for example

684
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,210
indebtedness

685
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:43,770
you know it's politically desirable for those in to borrow money and spend

686
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,490
because their constituencies only look at what they get and when they get a lot

687
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,409
they don't pay attention to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books

688
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,049
so it's always better to borrow spend and then leave the cleanup to the next guy

689
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:09,210
and so you inherit a lot you inherited as a new president enters in

690
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,490
or new legislators

691
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,649
they have a lot of debt

692
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,289
they have a broken down infrastructure

693
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:16,890
um

694
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,090
they don't have enough money to fix that

695
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,890
and so that's the lay of the land that the prior generations put you in

696
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,730
and there you are

697
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,169
and so that's right

698
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,130
um

699
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:31,929
it's difficult

700
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,690
because when you start to think

701
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,010
okay

702
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,649
what's healthy

703
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:35,529
well

704
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,450
spend earn more than you spend

705
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,010
well

706
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,890
that's not so easy

707
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,809
because you know

708
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:41,450
what does that mean

709
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,730
go earn more

710
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:43,690
i mean

711
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,010
okay

712
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,130
that's not so easy

713
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,490
spend less

714
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,250
that isn't going to work

715
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,250
so now what do you do

716
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:50,809
okay

717
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,970
you have this debt that you then monetize

718
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,210
and that's why it's classic

719
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:55,850
so

720
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,010
yes

721
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,450
that's why these cycles occur

722
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,610
because what has created before

723
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,169
put

724
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,010
what happened before created

725
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,130
the lay of the land

726
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,770
that is then increasingly difficult to deal with

727
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,330
so what can great leaders do in this moment

728
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:08,970
i mean

729
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,370
maybe

730
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:09,850
um

731
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,649
my sense is leadership is crucial here

732
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,010
so for example

733
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,690
to do very large projects that invest in the education system

734
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,929
that sort of try to fix the fundamentals or maybe invest more

735
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:27,370
and more into the innovation and the develop development of new technologies

736
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,250
and so on

737
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,090
it feels like that just doesn't happen organically

738
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:42,250
so you have to have strong leaders that convince the populace of the importance of these ideas

739
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:43,770
well

740
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,850
i completely agree with your list

741
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,210
what we have is a situation where everybody has their opinions

742
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,490
and they have to sort of get them exactly right

743
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,769
and they all fight with each other about whether their opinions

744
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,490
so

745
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,169
the most important thing is that we are become bipartisan so that we don't

746
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,090
and we get over our differences

747
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,289
i would have a bipartisan cabinet

748
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,090
i would draw upon um

749
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,730
both members of both parties

750
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,169
the the moderates

751
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,809
who are going to be able to work together

752
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,370
so as then we have one country

753
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,529
and then we deal with those in a means

754
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,610
that works for the majority of the people in the middle rather than the polarity

755
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,450
i think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that

756
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,210
so i would say that's a paramount importance

757
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,529
because we have the resources

758
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,049
you know

759
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,450
um

760
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:46,649
wealth

761
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,890
real wealth and and science

762
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,690
and everything has never been better than it is

763
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,929
but the notion is that it has to work for the majority of people

764
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,370
and we have to keep it being productive

765
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,850
so that that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably work together

766
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,450
so that they increase the size of the pie and they create broad-based prosperity

767
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,250
so that is a paramount importance

768
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,490
whatever they do

769
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,289
if they do it

770
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:17,690
that way

771
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,649
i can say i'm happy about

772
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,210
because that other alternative is the really scary alternative

773
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:28,649
the

774
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:30,809
the scary alternative

775
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,890
the different ways it has evolved throughout history

776
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,130
some of it has led to wars what are the future trajectories

777
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,610
that lead to a potential war with china

778
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,409
cold war or hot war

779
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,010
is this something you think about

780
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,450
is this something you're worried about

781
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,330
yeah

782
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,090
i'd like to talk about both wars

783
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,450
so the war with china

784
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:54,890
as i say

785
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,090
there are five kinds of wars

786
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,090
there's a trade war

787
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:58,409
tech

788
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:58,809
um

789
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,529
technology

790
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:00,169
war

791
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,130
geopolitical

792
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,010
influence

793
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,570
war

794
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:03,529
um

795
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,890
capital war and military war

796
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:07,850
i

797
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,250
um

798
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,330
as far as military war goes

799
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:10,970
i only

800
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,529
i think it's only a taiwan issue

801
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,490
um

802
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,690
but that's a big issue

803
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,090
and we could talk about that for a minute

804
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,809
but those others there'll be

805
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,370
uh

806
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,450
rough competitions and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time

807
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,850
that's what that war looks like

808
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,769
taiwan has been for a long time

809
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,929
a sovereignty issue to china

810
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,130
and it has its roots in what's called the hundred years of humiliation

811
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,049
from the 1840s to 1949

812
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,929
foreign powers came in took advantage of china

813
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,049
they had the opium wars and such times

814
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:57,929
and

815
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,010
and that represented the 100 years of humiliation and taiwan represents

816
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,810
is their sovereignty and their important thing

817
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,649
and 50 years ago

818
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,929
starting 50 years ago

819
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,449
there was an agreement that there is one china

820
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,969
and taiwan is part of china and that there would be peaceful reunification

821
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,730
the the peaceful reunification hasn't happened

822
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,089
and in their view

823
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,570
that's a very big issue

824
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,730
and so it's a big contentious issue

825
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:37,849
and that

826
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,250
uh

827
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,570
could produce a military war

828
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,530
um

829
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,129
could produce a military accident

830
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,250
could produce a

831
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,369
it's a very tense situation

832
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,849
and if we had a military war

833
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,929
god help us because of the capacity in all different new ways to inflict um harm on each other

834
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:56,889
but anyway

835
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,250
that's that's that

836
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,210
if you don't have that military war

837
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,730
you'll have the competition between those other kinds of wars and whoever is strongest in those areas

838
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,329
will um win

839
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,690
where do you put cyber war within the five

840
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:14,730
well

841
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,050
cyber war is a military war

842
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,609
i'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're using you're referring to

843
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,410
is that

844
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,170
which it's used to inflict pain on the other party through cyber

845
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,690
so cyber wars

846
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:28,970
you'll see cyber war

847
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,130
you could see space war

848
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,609
you can see drone warfare

849
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,050
you

850
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,450
um

851
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:36,890
new types of warfare

852
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,690
not just the traditional and nuclear type of warfare

853
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,849
but you could see any of the above

854
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,130
what are the defining characteristics

855
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,130
what are the interesting things about xi jinping

856
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,810
the president of china as a leader on the world stage

857
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,290
his father was a early leader

858
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,450
he was himself

859
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,609
[music] in the cultural revolution

860
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,530
at times treated brutally

861
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:12,890
um

862
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,530
and during that period of time

863
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,089
it was very

864
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:19,369
very difficult and he came up

865
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,250
you know

866
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,130
through the ranks

867
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:28,570
and he's a very intelligent man when he first came to power

868
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,050
they

869
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:29,690
as you know

870
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:36,089
they have two five-year terms and we're now coming to the end of the second of those five-year terms

871
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,849
when he first came to power

872
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,690
he felt that there should be a lot of reform

873
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,210
and reform meant moving to much more of a market

874
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,170
an open economy

875
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,410
when that happened in him coming in

876
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,329
i had some contact with economic policymakers

877
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,050
but

878
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,890
and the circumstances then were that five major banks lent to state-owned enterprises

879
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,490
and local governments with implied government guarantees

880
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,770
and so there was not control of that

881
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,410
and they

882
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,849
and the movement to aim more of a market economy and the development of markets

883
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:16,570
uh

884
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,329
was a primary and also the dealing with the corruption issue

885
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,849
there was a lot of corruption prior to that

886
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,770
and that was viewed as an existential threat to the system

887
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,329
so that became the primary objective

888
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,410
and then

889
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,849
as time progressed

890
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,849
over those 10 years

891
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,130
there was a a lot of changing in the world

892
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,450
finance

893
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,970
their financial circumstances

894
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,329
opening many

895
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,450
many other markets

896
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,810
they particularly getting money to small

897
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,890
and medium-sized enterprises and developing a lending system and then establishing controls on it

898
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,089
so right now

899
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:56,650
um

900
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,329
there's a vibrant

901
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,290
um capital markets

902
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,250
um

903
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,609
you can raise capital

904
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,650
you can be an entrepreneur

905
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,369
you can become a billionaire

906
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,849
um in the capital markets

907
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,290
and they develop the markets to be the second largest capital markets at the same time

908
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,010
um

909
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,130
they had to deal with their um

910
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,490
rising debt issue

911
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,450
which they began to deal with

912
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,010
uh

913
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:34,570
really about four years ago when the second term began and the um

914
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,329
and then uh

915
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:36,890
lu huh

916
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,690
became

917
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,410
um

918
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,329
the vice premier

919
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,290
um

920
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,290
responsible for that and to um and deal with uh

921
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,089
those issues

922
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,089
so you see right now that what's happening is

923
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:50,810
uh

924
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,570
the dealing with the real estate bubble

925
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,650
there was a development in real estate

926
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,570
a bubble which produced

927
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,290
um

928
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,130
a lot of unproductive lending

929
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,490
and xi ping said you know houses are meant to live in

930
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,690
not to speculate on

931
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,450
and so that was wasteful

932
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,650
so they established what they call three red lines

933
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,930
which are financial ratios that the property developers had to live within

934
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,890
and that is then causing the adjustments that are going on now

935
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:24,890
which in my view are very healthy

936
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,450
because

937
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,250
um

938
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,170
whenever there's uh

939
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,369
bankruptcies and so on

940
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,490
the most in the public

941
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,290
think

942
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,690
okay

943
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,490
that's a problem

944
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,890
it's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts and bad practices

945
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,690
and so

946
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:38,329
um

947
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,690
that's what's going on

948
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,050
so that's let's say

949
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,450
economically

950
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,609
at the same time

951
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,050
there is the changing relationships

952
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,290
the changing world order the changing relationships with the united states and other countries

953
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:54,890
which is becoming

954
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:55,690
um

955
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,490
much less cooperative and much more war-like much more confrontational

956
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,170
um

957
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,770
those two things

958
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,250
the the domestic debt problem and domestic has led to

959
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,130
um

960
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,730
what's called core

961
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,250
what they call core leadership

962
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,569
which means a leadership more around him

963
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,930
that is less challenging

964
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,410
because they believe in history

965
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,970
that during very difficult times

966
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:25,930
um

967
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:34,329
a more centrally controlled decision-making process lends itself better than to a more fragmented political contentious project

968
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,770
and that's basically what's going on

969
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,050
now you said it very eloquently

970
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,930
but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men

971
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,210
and there's a lot of centralized control

972
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,490
that characterization is

973
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,210
view

974
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,329
is much more black and white than it really is

975
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,290
uh

976
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,490
but it leans towards that direction they're like

977
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,970
for example of the standing members of the polar bureau

978
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,170
four are more eligi allied him three or less

979
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:14,010
so you have to understand that it's kind of a collective leadership at the top

980
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:14,970
and then

981
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,290
of course there's just jockeying for power

982
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,089
um

983
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,490
you know

984
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,930
in a highly political sense

985
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:20,810
um

986
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,690
at the top

987
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,410
uh

988
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,849
but no one leader can be successful against the uh

989
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,690
all those powers at the top

990
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,089
so it's very politically negotiating

991
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,050
it's

992
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:33,690
you know

993
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,050
it's very much more like

994
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,369
if you put um in the united states

995
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,170
the democrats and the republicans and they had to be in the same government and they work it out

996
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:42,810
uh

997
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,890
it's kind of something like that

998
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:45,450
and then

999
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,810
so that's that struggle

1000
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,650
but it's an internal struggle

1001
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,329
where do you put the importance of some of these ideas at the founding of the united states

1002
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,650
when then now we're talking about at the context of china

1003
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,170
the freedom of speech

1004
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:00,970
freedoms

1005
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,210
what china is doing with the central management of a lot of things

1006
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,690
it's enabling a lot of growth

1007
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,650
but it's also limiting people on the very basic level

1008
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,450
in terms of freedom

1009
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,290
the kind of freedom that i think can lead to entrepreneurship to starting new businesses

1010
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,890
to having big dreams and chasing those dreams and then creating totally new things in whatever the space

1011
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,609
maybe in technology

1012
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,490
in business and whatever

1013
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,170
what

1014
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,650
how important is that as a metric for society

1015
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,530
well

1016
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,329
they have a view

1017
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,210
which is the idea of a dialectic

1018
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,650
which means that two things are at obvious

1019
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,609
that everything comes with pros and cons and two opposites exist

1020
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,050
and you want the benefits of those two opposites

1021
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,970
and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites

1022
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,690
right

1023
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,490
so let's say you want the capital markets because it gets

1024
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,530
uh money into the hands of the entrepreneurs who are motivated they build fortunes

1025
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,369
and that drives an economy to do very well

1026
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,970
and at the same time

1027
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:09,930
um

1028
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:10,730
it produces

1029
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:11,609
uh

1030
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,490
the other problems

1031
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,369
the wealth gaps

1032
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,490
the other problems

1033
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,369
then the debt cycle that we're talking about

1034
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:17,930
and so on

1035
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,369
and deng xiaoping

1036
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:20,490
you know

1037
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,530
how do you reconcile communism and

1038
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:24,329
um

1039
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,810
the market economy and the capital markets

1040
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,930
and he

1041
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:28,569
uh

1042
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,690
famously said

1043
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:30,089
um

1044
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,569
and if it doesn't matter

1045
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,250
if it's a white cat or a black cat

1046
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,609
just as long as it catches mice

1047
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,730
in other words

1048
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,290
if it

1049
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,690
if it works in making the country richer

1050
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,849
then that becomes the objective

1051
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,369
and then they move that along

1052
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,650
so there are these conflicts

1053
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,089
um

1054
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,290
and um

1055
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,050
one of the leaders described it to me as follows

1056
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:54,890
because it's confusion and it goes back over a period of time

1057
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,890
there's a a hierarchy and it's an extension of

1058
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,210
uh

1059
00:43:59,280 --> 00:43:59,690
the family

1060
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:07,050
he described it and he said the united states is a country of individuals and individualism

1061
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,970
and that is its vibrancy

1062
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,250
that

1063
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:12,730
um

1064
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,530
we see the individual rights to speak up

1065
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,010
the individual [music] protection of the individual

1066
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,810
individual property rights and all of those things

1067
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,250
as of uh

1068
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,369
paramount importance

1069
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,450
and we build our organization

1070
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,010
that's why democracy is from the bottom up

1071
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,810
or even a company

1072
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,329
we'll get together and we'll be partners to proper prosper

1073
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,890
together that is the american approach

1074
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,089
um

1075
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,810
he was describing that in china

1076
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,890
it's an extension of the confucian family essentially

1077
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,290
and so it's almost like

1078
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:49,849
um

1079
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,490
um

1080
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:50,890
you know

1081
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,450
there's a hierarchy

1082
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,849
and so what they think about is the common good

1083
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:56,810
uh

1084
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,770
not the individualism

1085
00:44:59,280 --> 00:44:59,530
so

1086
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,010
for example

1087
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,450
if they want a high-speed rail to go from one place to another

1088
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,930
and that's best in the common good

1089
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,730
then the individual protections that would stand in the way of doing that would be of secondary concern

1090
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,730
so that notion of uh controlling

1091
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:17,690
so it

1092
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:17,690
it

1093
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,329
for example

1094
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:19,530
um

1095
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,290
the what what they're doing with

1096
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:21,609
uh

1097
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,410
video games

1098
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:23,369
um

1099
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,410
they

1100
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,050
um

1101
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:25,609
control

1102
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,170
uh what type of video games and how many hours a day

1103
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,329
kids can be on video games

1104
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,290
um

1105
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,530
operating in that way

1106
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,609
because they believe that that's good for the society and that's very controlling in the united states

1107
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,170
i i think probably most parents would say

1108
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,970
leave it to me

1109
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,690
and it's it's a matter between me and my kids

1110
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,849
the same thing has to do with data

1111
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,130
in other words

1112
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,410
in the united states

1113
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,930
who controls the data

1114
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,810
does the company control the data

1115
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,369
do you individually control the data

1116
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,450
and so the inclination would be to figure that out

1117
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,970
but nobody would say that the government is going to control the data

1118
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,170
because of our inclination of really anti-government control in china

1119
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,329
it would be that the government will control the data because that's going to be best for the society

1120
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,010
and it depends who you trust

1121
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:26,810
but that's so that difference in philosophy is very much at the um

1122
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,450
you know

1123
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,250
at the heart of that

1124
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,770
as far as um

1125
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,930
your question in terms of effectiveness

1126
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,770
it really is in china's case

1127
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:37,609
it's how you balance the things right

1128
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,730
so what they're attempting to do is to create a lot of freedom and creativity

1129
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,170
um

1130
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,170
in areas that are not

1131
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:46,970
uh

1132
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,290
political

1133
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,170
let's say

1134
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,050
and and so you see

1135
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,410
on a lot of entrepreneurship

1136
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,210
you see a lot of product development

1137
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,050
you see a lot of creativity

1138
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:58,890
um

1139
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,490
happening in that way

1140
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,010
so the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening is is an old stereotype

1141
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,530
where's a lot of creativity

1142
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:08,810
certainly happening

1143
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,810
and the system can work well if they can achieve that kind of balance

1144
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,130
it's proven to have worked well since i started going there in 1984

1145
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,369
per capita income

1146
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,369
real per capita income has increased by 26 times

1147
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,410
the um longevity rate has increased by 10 years

1148
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,650
the poverty rate has fallen from 88 to less than 1

1149
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,770
in terms of

1150
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,250
you know

1151
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,809
basics like starvation and things

1152
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,970
and if you read history

1153
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:40,650
plato's republic

1154
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,730
you know he talks about the cycles

1155
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:43,849
democracy

1156
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,849
you know an autocratic and the benevolent despot

1157
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,809
and all of that

1158
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,010
each has their own vulnerability

1159
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,730
the vulnerability of democracy

1160
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:01,849
which has been a remarkable remarkable system and i don't have to extol the benefits of it

1161
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,490
um

1162
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,970
but the vulnerability of it has always been

1163
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,530
uh

1164
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:08,569
the um

1165
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,250
internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy

1166
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:13,369
um

1167
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,290
in world war ii

1168
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:16,329
uh

1169
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,930
four democracies chose to be autocracies

1170
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,490
um

1171
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,170
because there was internal disorder and there

1172
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:26,329
was

1173
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:27,530
this is the belief

1174
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,450
will somebody bring about order and get control of the situation

1175
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,369
you know that was in

1176
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:33,849
um

1177
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:34,569
germany

1178
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,210
italy

1179
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:35,930
uh

1180
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,250
japan

1181
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:36,890
and spain

1182
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:37,770
um

1183
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,290
they were parliamentary dictat systems that

1184
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:41,609
uh

1185
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,290
turned themselves over to that

1186
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,050
so both systems

1187
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:45,849
um

1188
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,569
have vulnerabilities

1189
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:48,809
um

1190
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,930
i think the main thing now that we need to think about is those vulnerabilities

1191
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:59,050
democracy is an amazing system because it requ

1192
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:00,089
the

1193
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:02,010
the adherence to the rules

1194
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:02,890
and the system

1195
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:10,010
and the checks and balances is quite amazing and it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars

1196
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:10,890
um

1197
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,530
um

1198
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,329
but there has to be the respect of the rules

1199
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,170
and when you see something like that

1200
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,010
they will not accept elections or they will not accept rules

1201
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,609
and history has shown when the causes that people are behind are more important to them than the system

1202
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,530
the system is in jeopardy

1203
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:37,530
so we have a situation that's very much like that

1204
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,450
in terms of let's say the 2024 elections

1205
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:49,450
i believe that there's a very high chance that neither side will accept losing

1206
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:50,970
for example

1207
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,730
and so we

1208
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:53,369
um

1209
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,690
we have that kind of a situation

1210
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:03,930
so one would hope that one could rise above the disagreements and rely on the system

1211
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:04,569
uh

1212
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,770
for resolving disagreements

1213
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,650
because if if that doesn't happen

1214
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:10,329
then we have our own

1215
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,210
uh chaos

1216
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,690
so the kind of the trend that started in 2020

1217
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:16,410
this

1218
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,210
or i mean

1219
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:17,609
i mean

1220
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,050
i suppose it's been there

1221
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,849
it's been growing a rep

1222
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,650
one representation of this internal disorder has been the growing trend of being skeptical about the results of the election

1223
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:29,770
well

1224
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,970
it started before that

1225
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,369
there was the emergence of populism

1226
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:34,809
where

1227
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,569
before uh president

1228
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:37,369
uh

1229
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,569
trump was elected

1230
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:42,650
he was basically elected as a populist

1231
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,010
because there was a large percentage of the population that felt that the system didn't work for them

1232
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,730
and he tapped into that and he was largely elected as a populist

1233
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:55,369
leader

1234
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,250
first

1235
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,809
populous leader in a developed country

1236
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,010
um

1237
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,569
and so populism began that

1238
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,050
then

1239
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:07,609
and that was a battle of one group against the other group

1240
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,130
and so since then it's been like that and it continued to grow

1241
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:21,930
you've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy

1242
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,690
that internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy

1243
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,050
what's the vulnerability of a system like china

1244
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,250
maybe one way to say is put china aside and look at history like a soviet union

1245
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,730
what's the vulnerability of a communist type system

1246
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,010
well

1247
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,329
i'll call it both communist and autocratic

1248
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:45,369
sure

1249
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,970
depending on how much autocracy is that it lacks flexibility

1250
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,650
it

1251
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,450
it lacks

1252
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,250
um

1253
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,130
the ability

1254
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:56,730
so

1255
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,329
but i should deal with them differently

1256
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,210
um

1257
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,930
in other words

1258
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,290
there's the economic system

1259
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,130
the economic system

1260
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:03,849
um

1261
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,650
threatens motivation and productivity

1262
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,130
so communism or socialism

1263
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,490
uh

1264
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,809
has to be done in a way where

1265
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:13,770
um

1266
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,609
you can threaten productivity

1267
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,410
capitalism has

1268
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,410
and what i mean by that

1269
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,609
i mean free markets and capital markets

1270
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,089
i have been an effective way of allocating resources and also creating the

1271
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,970
the incentives and the resources

1272
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,569
providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas

1273
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,369
and so if i compare that

1274
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,329
what the chinese have done to a large extent is to recognize that and have made a move

1275
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,369
that's why the uh seeming dialectic or the conflict between those two things exists

1276
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,170
but anyway

1277
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,290
that's it

1278
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,369
as far as an autocratic system

1279
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,329
rather than um

1280
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,290
one man

1281
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,609
one vote from the population up

1282
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,530
the risks of the autocratic system is

1283
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:15,130
that there's enough discontent that arises that the system doesn't have the flexibility

1284
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,890
and that

1285
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,010
rather than bending

1286
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:18,970
um

1287
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:19,849
it breaks

1288
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:20,890
um

1289
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,130
that's that's the big risk

1290
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:23,849
um

1291
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,010
the notion of trying to control a um

1292
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:28,970
if there's that

1293
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,410
rather than giving it the flexibility

1294
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:31,930
um

1295
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:33,050
so that's the

1296
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,849
that would be the big risk of the autocratic system

1297
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,730
what's the human

1298
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:37,609
uh

1299
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,050
because you mentioned

1300
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,730
like the top gets bigger with empires

1301
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,369
and you start taking things for granted is the some of this just human nature

1302
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,849
so the concern with with china with autocratic nations

1303
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,329
the concern with the the third reich

1304
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,369
the soviet union was that fundamentally at the individual level

1305
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,130
the humans involved at the top they start becoming

1306
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:13,369
they're starting to lose touch with reality in a way that no longer makes them

1307
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:16,650
i guess that's the representation of the flexibility that you're referring to

1308
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,130
well

1309
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,369
i'm

1310
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:17,849
i mean

1311
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,970
in a democracy you could change

1312
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,050
you can go as far left or as far right

1313
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,450
you can change the leaders easily

1314
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,130
and so the people don't become

1315
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,170
um

1316
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,890
you know

1317
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,730
they pretty much only have themselves to blame

1318
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:31,530
uh

1319
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:32,089
yeah

1320
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:32,730
you know

1321
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,450
and one of the problems of that is they may not choose the best leaders

1322
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:39,849
but they

1323
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,609
they have that flexibility

1324
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,210
so if vote and you get what you wanted in the case of the autocratic

1325
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:48,089
let's say

1326
00:54:48,099 --> 00:54:48,329
leaders

1327
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,089
and then the movement from democracies to autocracies

1328
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,450
what you see

1329
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,410
normally that movement is that one of the systems

1330
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:58,970
is

1331
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,250
it is not working

1332
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,410
let's say the democracy is not effectively

1333
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,690
everybody's arguing with each other and nobody's getting anything done

1334
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,890
and you know

1335
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,690
like mussolini

1336
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,690
the trains are not running on time

1337
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,849
and that would be the example

1338
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,410
jesus

1339
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,010
this place has gotten chaotic

1340
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,210
will somebody get into control and then they

1341
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,089
then you get the autocratic um

1342
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,450
and then he's autocratic enough to boss people around and um

1343
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:28,410
and then you follow those kinds of orders

1344
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,690
and it's like a

1345
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:33,290
maybe a ceo in a powerful company ordering around

1346
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,410
and that could work well

1347
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:35,450
or it could work badly

1348
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,250
you know

1349
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,250
most um companies are run as

1350
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:40,890
um

1351
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,690
like autocracies in a sense

1352
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,250
you know there's the hierarchy and you the command economy and that kind of thing

1353
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,329
and now that can work well or not

1354
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:53,210
um

1355
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,890
but then what

1356
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,530
quite often

1357
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:56,569
when you get the populist

1358
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:57,690
autocratic

1359
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,849
their personality is something that they want to fight

1360
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,730
and they become more nationalistic

1361
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:14,890
and they tend to become more militaristic and human nature at that stage lends itself to fighting

1362
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,450
there's an arc here that when we think it's we think of a country

1363
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,490
um

1364
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:21,770
and we say we

1365
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,210
when we think of a country

1366
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,170
um

1367
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,210
it's not true

1368
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,250
it's not like that there are individuals who change

1369
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,170
one generation dies and another generation comes along

1370
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,530
and one of those arcs is that

1371
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,089
um

1372
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:42,809
the ones who have been through war don't want to go to war and are more happily

1373
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:43,930
you know

1374
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,410
willing to

1375
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:44,809
um

1376
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,369
abide by whatever the rules are

1377
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,650
as you get farther along into that cycle

1378
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,730
and you get a new generation and they forget about wars and the horrors of wars

1379
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:55,770
then they

1380
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,250
um

1381
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,930
then they want to

1382
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:58,490
uh

1383
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:58,890
uh

1384
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,290
fight

1385
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,130
and so you're seeing right now

1386
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,170
the emergent of fight for right

1387
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,530
and and what that means is you see it internally

1388
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:08,730
uh

1389
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,130
fight

1390
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,970
where are you and fight for that thing

1391
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,010
and they mean fight and then into externally

1392
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,650
fight are you going to be

1393
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:19,049
uh

1394
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,410
the strong one who will fight and win and that develops

1395
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,450
on both sides

1396
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,329
this fight and win and each side is cheering each other on into

1397
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:29,049
uh

1398
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:29,609
a war

1399
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,569
but that's comes by those who really have not experienced war

1400
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,970
because it comes in their part of their lifetime

1401
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,450
humans are fascinating

1402
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,210
humans are fascinating

1403
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:42,490
and by the way

1404
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:47,849
human nature has not changed over the thousands of years

1405
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:48,809
so it's the

1406
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,690
it's so interesting

1407
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,170
because

1408
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,609
like in doing this study and it comes across in the study

1409
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,410
it's like watching the same movie over and over again

1410
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:57,849
you

1411
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:58,569
you know

1412
00:57:58,579 --> 00:57:59,450
you see the ark

1413
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,210
and you see it happen over

1414
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:06,250
and over again the only things that seem to change are the clothes people wear and the technologies

1415
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:09,690
uh

1416
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:11,210
yeah

1417
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,530
and then somebody probably will disagree with you about the clothes

1418
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,450
maybe there's also cycles within fashions

1419
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,690
maybe we're not even creative there

1420
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:18,730
uh

1421
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,290
what do you um make of

1422
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:21,609
uh

1423
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,849
russia and vladimir putin

1424
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,930
what do you think about putin as a leader as a human being on this world stage

1425
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,890
within the context of the cycles of empires that you think about

1426
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,010
well

1427
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,650
putin came to power at the failure of russia's last order

1428
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,609
so there was

1429
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,530
there was the end of communism and there was the development of the market economy

1430
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:49,690
the collapse of the soviet union

1431
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:52,490
and at that

1432
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,970
time he was appointed by yeltsin

1433
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,569
who was an alcoholic and had problems managing and was put into power

1434
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:08,569
and the conditions in the russian were the work

1435
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:09,130
there was anarchy

1436
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:10,410
um

1437
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:12,010
there was no money

1438
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:12,410
it was

1439
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:15,049
it had the classic end of cycle ingredients

1440
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,010
it was broke

1441
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,569
it was people were fighting with each other

1442
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:19,290
was the anarchy

1443
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,290
and that's when he came to power and

1444
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:24,089
um

1445
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,329
there were not institutions

1446
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,010
the whole thing had collapsed and it was not effective

1447
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,450
ministry of education

1448
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:32,650
ministry of anything

1449
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:40,170
and so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability

1450
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:46,970
and they needed a democracy and they needed the the improvement of capital markets

1451
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,089
um

1452
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,210
so he's been in that position as

1453
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:51,690
a

1454
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,170
um

1455
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:56,010
as i guess i would call him

1456
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:56,730
um

1457
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,930
a semi-autocratic leader in that

1458
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,329
from all indications

1459
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,809
he would respect the democracy

1460
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:06,329
um

1461
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,930
and he's very popular

1462
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,849
he's won democratic elections because he's been a strong leader and he's brought uh

1463
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,930
peace and stability to the soviet u

1464
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,250
to

1465
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:18,970
to russia

1466
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,369
after the breakup of the soviet union

1467
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:22,490
and

1468
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:22,970
um

1469
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:32,089
he's a strong leader in pursuit of the the country's interests in

1470
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:32,730
um

1471
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:43,930
a way where russia is not a significant economic power and but it is a significant military power

1472
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,130
um

1473
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:45,690
so

1474
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:46,410
um

1475
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:47,450
the issues

1476
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,049
and then there's a strong alliance between russia and china

1477
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:51,450
now

1478
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:52,490
um

1479
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,290
so

1480
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,369
that's kind of the lay of the land

1481
01:00:56,799 --> 01:00:57,970
and then there are sensitivities

1482
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,210
the ukraine issue is

1483
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:01,690
uh

1484
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:02,170
a sensitivity

1485
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:03,450
um

1486
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,809
because of

1487
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,930
there are a lot of russians who live in the ukraine

1488
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:11,690
and there's also the issue of nato on it

1489
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:12,329
on their border

1490
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:13,369
um

1491
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,290
so there are those kinds of things

1492
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,210
and he has military power and he has a strong alliance with china

1493
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,170
um

1494
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,690
and i guess that's my best summary of

1495
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:24,250
um

1496
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,930
what his position is strong leader

1497
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:28,730
um

1498
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:29,450
popular

1499
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:30,650
um

1500
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,490
[music] these are not subjective interpretations

1501
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:35,770
these are

1502
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:36,089
uh

1503
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,049
objective interpretations

1504
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:37,930
yeah

1505
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:38,569
it's interesting

1506
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,010
just in this conversation

1507
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,290
you're not sort of um

1508
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,369
doing the usual criticism

1509
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,130
of any one particular system

1510
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,849
you're looking at these systems from the perspective of history

1511
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,170
you're just describing how they work

1512
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,010
it's often times

1513
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:56,089
when you talk about what russia is today

1514
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,250
or what the soviet union was or what china is today is you start to criticize

1515
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:00,890
well

1516
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:01,130
they

1517
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,410
they do this kind of censorship or they do this kind of

1518
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,329
they limit freedoms in this kind of way

1519
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,049
but you're just kind of describing this as a nation with ideas

1520
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,250
what they think is right

1521
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,890
this is how they hope to get it to work

1522
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,170
this is why it's working

1523
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,450
this is what's not working

1524
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:20,650
here's metrics that show that it's not working

1525
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,369
i think that's a refreshing way to think about it

1526
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:24,089
it's easy

1527
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:24,410
though

1528
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,530
i mean you got some criticism

1529
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:26,410
um

1530
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:28,010
saying that

1531
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,530
i think china's a strict parent

1532
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:31,049
um

1533
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:32,650
you know

1534
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,410
some people criticize these countries for doing

1535
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:36,170
uh

1536
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,410
so for violating human rights

1537
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:43,530
i suppose there's some people that criticize the united states violating human rights

1538
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:56,089
but what are your thoughts on the world stage today about some of the behaviors of this government in terms of respecting the rights

1539
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,690
the basic rights of human beings

1540
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,369
you described accurately

1541
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,250
how i just try to look at things in an um

1542
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:04,970
a non

1543
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,849
i don't want to impute my values yes on anybody

1544
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:10,809
um

1545
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,849
i mean there are intolerable things

1546
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:16,250
so i'm not saying there aren't intolerable things

1547
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:16,890
but

1548
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:17,289
um

1549
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:20,569
one of the great things of being an american here is

1550
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:25,930
that i grew up with all different nationalities having all different points of view

1551
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,369
and all different religions and all different ways of operating

1552
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,730
and i've come to treasure the fact that that is

1553
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:35,930
you know

1554
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:36,329
what's their

1555
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:36,650
business

1556
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:37,609
is their business

1557
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,289
and then the question is

1558
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:40,730
where do you cross the line

1559
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:45,369
under what circumstances that that others have got to do it my way

1560
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,089
and then

1561
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:47,329
when you do it internationally

1562
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:48,890
uh

1563
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,450
the ob

1564
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,930
the issue of what is a sovereign state

1565
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,049
you know which

1566
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:53,369
um

1567
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,730
as i say in the piece of west failure and you have borders

1568
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:57,930
and you

1569
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,170
then

1570
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,369
when do you cross the line

1571
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,170
that

1572
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:00,650
um

1573
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,329
my way of doing things has got to be their way of doing things

1574
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:05,690
or what are the various rights

1575
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,289
and so that's a very

1576
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:07,849
uh

1577
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:10,730
delicate question or a very difficult question

1578
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,849
and we all have responsibilities to different parties

1579
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:20,569
and we all have different levels of knowledge about those particular things

1580
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:21,369
so

1581
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:21,849
um

1582
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:22,329
so

1583
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:22,809
for example

1584
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:25,130
as an international investor

1585
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,609
i have a responsibility to my investors

1586
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:34,170
those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs of how do they run that

1587
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,690
so if you're taking nike or stinkers and so on

1588
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:43,130
and americans can decide whether they want to buy product

1589
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,609
chinese products or not buy chinese products

1590
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,490
we are all faced with those types of choices

1591
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:53,049
so you have what do you want to do in your constituency and you have your choices

1592
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,170
and then

1593
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:55,130
beyond that

1594
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,010
in many cases

1595
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,450
the issues are quite complex

1596
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,849
like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it

1597
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:02,490
so

1598
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:03,049
um

1599
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:03,770
uh

1600
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,770
and then i i believe that if if you disconnected

1601
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:09,450
if all those

1602
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,490
if entities like myself

1603
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:13,369
the businesses

1604
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:14,410
uh

1605
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,650
doing business with china disconnected

1606
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,770
i think that that would be disastrous

1607
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,369
economically disastrous

1608
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,490
and it would also be um reduce

1609
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:25,530
um

1610
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:26,010
the

1611
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:30,730
the understanding that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars

1612
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:32,809
and so these are all complicated

1613
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,609
so what we do is

1614
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,010
uh

1615
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:37,770
and and who makes it

1616
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,369
my opinion matters the most

1617
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,650
why should it be my opinion

1618
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,490
that matters the most in making that decision

1619
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,210
so i largely look at the guide

1620
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:50,329
the government guidance that i get not only from my own government but from the other governments

1621
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,690
and i follow the rules

1622
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:52,809
i'm in 40

1623
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,410
we invest in 40 countries

1624
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,049
and we want to do that in the best way to provide the diversified portfolio

1625
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,210
and we sort of need that every one of those countries has similar complexities

1626
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,049
there are always one issue or another and then

1627
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:13,530
and there's only so much that we really understand about all of those issues

1628
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:17,609
so we rely largely on the guidance that we you have

1629
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:20,730
get empathize and show respect to the the culture of the place

1630
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,089
the way things are done

1631
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,089
you don't necessarily

1632
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:24,970
um

1633
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,650
the way you heal relationships between nations is like

1634
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,289
like you said

1635
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,170
you work together

1636
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:38,089
and that requires kind of um to listen

1637
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,450
maybe more than you talk

1638
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,010
and i think people in the public sphere

1639
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:43,530
uh

1640
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,329
talk a lot about china without really listening

1641
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,770
without understanding much about china

1642
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:50,250
without one of the things that makes me really sad

1643
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:54,170
because i know how to speak russian and i can

1644
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:55,930
i know how much is lost in translation

1645
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,049
it makes me sad that i'll never really get to know the chinese culture

1646
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:01,609
because

1647
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,329
like i'll never really get to know the language

1648
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,130
the literature

1649
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,770
the just talk to regular people

1650
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,250
it's not just the government or officials or scientists

1651
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:11,369
just regular folks

1652
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,089
get the culture

1653
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,049
i think

1654
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:14,250
if you don't understand the culture

1655
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,010
uh

1656
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,530
just the basics of the human nature of what people love about their country

1657
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,250
about their family or the kind of hopes they have

1658
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,970
you know what kind of values they have without that

1659
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:28,970
you're not going to be able to um

1660
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:31,049
fully

1661
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,849
um connect with them

1662
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,450
and you have to do that first to have a chance of building a good world

1663
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,890
i couldn't agree with you more

1664
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:39,930
i was very lucky

1665
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:40,329
because

1666
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,530
as i say

1667
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:41,770
uh

1668
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:43,210
you know

1669
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,010
since 1984

1670
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,210
so

1671
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,650
for more than half of my life i've been going there

1672
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,089
and i and the common people and all sorts of people

1673
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,530
and i've got to meet them

1674
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:54,809
i don't speak the language

1675
01:07:56,160 --> 01:08:00,410
but it a combination of through translators or men

1676
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,490
them speaking english and being in situations

1677
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,970
i had my son go to school

1678
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,930
a local school and we

1679
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,089
we developed those kinds of understandings

1680
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,450
i think that

1681
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:12,329
um

1682
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:21,290
but the not wanting to know the other perspective is the thing that's most scary

1683
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:21,850
yeah

1684
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,969
like i'm right now in the middle and um

1685
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,569
and all i want to try to do is to help mutual understanding

1686
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,649
you're right if there were questions probing me asking me what is it

1687
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,408
i'm not on one side or another

1688
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:39,210
i get

1689
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,210
i don't want to be on one side or another

1690
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,890
i believe that each has their right within there to approach their different culture in their own way

1691
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,130
so many ways you gave an example it

1692
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:49,448
uh

1693
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:49,770
um

1694
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:50,810
if they're not

1695
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:51,448
um

1696
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,210
doing harm to others

1697
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:54,569
i mean so

1698
01:08:54,640 --> 01:09:03,049
but that issue of um trying to understand is so much better

1699
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,890
that doesn't mean agree with

1700
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,089
if you are wanting to out-clever and out-compete somebody

1701
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,850
it still pays to understand what they're thinking

1702
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,210
so

1703
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:22,089
to achieve understanding of what they're thinking even if you want to go to war with them

1704
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,488
that understanding is the best thing to have

1705
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:30,330
what we have now is a situation in which there's an enemy mentality

1706
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:35,210
and that means that anything that serves the

1707
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:36,649
seems to be like understanding

1708
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:44,890
or conveying understanding seems to mistakenly create the notion of i'm on their side in a war

1709
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:47,448
and that's kind of a dangerous thing

1710
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:47,770
because

1711
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:48,810
um

1712
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:52,408
there's a momentum here to fight henry kissinger

1713
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,330
praises your new book and you thank him in it in the dedication

1714
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,210
what's your relationship like with him

1715
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,330
what makes him interesting

1716
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:01,610
maybe

1717
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:02,489
what makes him controversial

1718
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,929
what makes him such a central figure in history the first

1719
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,130
most importantly

1720
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,050
he's unique about seeing things through all the others eyes

1721
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,610
so if you were

1722
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,770
it's like there's a chess game

1723
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:18,250
i mean

1724
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:22,730
i think geopolit geopolitics is like a chess game

1725
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:26,010
but with multiple chess players playing the same game

1726
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:26,489
yes

1727
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,050
so imagine there are six people around playing the chess game

1728
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,850
and he could sit in each seat

1729
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,090
and he could know how they see it okay

1730
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,850
and see it in a calm way of how they see it

1731
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,610
he's unique in that way

1732
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:47,370
he's 98 years old and he's equally able to do that

1733
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,570
and he has a background that

1734
01:10:50,719 --> 01:10:51,929
in which he's a historian

1735
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,730
so he really understands history

1736
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:55,929
super

1737
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:58,010
um

1738
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,850
he doesn't understand economic history as much

1739
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:02,570
so that's why

1740
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,449
to some extent we enjoy having a conversation

1741
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,370
because he's interested in the act and in the economic piece

1742
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,090
he doesn't know

1743
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:14,489
and i'm so interested in the geopolitical piece that i don't know as well

1744
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:15,449
but anyway

1745
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,570
he's able to do that

1746
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,770
but not only a historian but a practitioner

1747
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:21,690
so

1748
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:28,170
when you go from an academic to a practitioner who has

1749
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,890
that talent to see things through others eyes in an objective way

1750
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,170
and to be strategic rather than just tactical

1751
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,650
that's a very special person

1752
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,330
and that's why henry is

1753
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:40,810
uh

1754
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:42,090
to me a very special person

1755
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,130
yeah

1756
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,570
he's lived a fascinating life

1757
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:50,090
just all all of the world events he's been involved in is fascinating

1758
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:51,530
and like you said

1759
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,730
that's such an interesting skill to have to consider

1760
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,610
what are the concerns

1761
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,409
the hope

1762
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:56,890
the dreams

1763
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,090
the fears of the

1764
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:59,210
all the people at the table

1765
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,090
what are they thinking

1766
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,929
i find that people don't once again

1767
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:04,890
don't do that enough

1768
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,449
when it's the obvious thing you should be doing

1769
01:12:07,459 --> 01:12:10,489
whether it's business deals or um

1770
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,010
political negotiation or geopolitical negotiation

1771
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:16,570
i'm often surprised again

1772
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:17,929
sorry to go to the russian thing

1773
01:12:17,939 --> 01:12:19,610
because i i i hear

1774
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,370
sort of like

1775
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:27,610
i hear putin talk in russian and you start to infer certain intentions and like not the trivial stuff

1776
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,050
like the human being

1777
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:33,610
what is what is that human being hoping for himself for his country

1778
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:34,810
for his

1779
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,370
close in a circle for the bigger like

1780
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,969
and i i just see that that's often just lost in translation

1781
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:41,770
i just see

1782
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:44,570
like american leaders talking to putin

1783
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,409
and it's just not

1784
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:47,370
it's

1785
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:48,170
there's not a connection

1786
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,050
absolutely

1787
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,650
i know exactly what you're talking about you

1788
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:53,370
i

1789
01:12:53,440 --> 01:13:00,250
it has never failed that in my listening to a conversation and or even reading a speech

1790
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:01,290
or

1791
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,730
and you see

1792
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:03,770
then it reported

1793
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,890
the inevitably the reporter picked some headline characterization

1794
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,530
that has very little to do with what was really happening

1795
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,090
but might be a headline grabber

1796
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:24,090
that's at some kind of distortion and there's a lack of understanding of really what's going on

1797
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,610
if it's okay

1798
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,010
let me ask you a couple questions about cryptocurrency

1799
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:29,770
uh

1800
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,170
you've had a few opinions about bitcoin over the years

1801
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,250
what are your thoughts about bitcoin today

1802
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,770
its role in the global financial system and just in human society

1803
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:40,409
in general

1804
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:41,530
well

1805
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:49,210
the evolution of bitcoin over the years is one of the things that has influenced changes

1806
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:49,929
in my view

1807
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,330
it has proven itself something like 10

1808
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,290
11 years ago

1809
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,690
imagine the programming of this

1810
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,409
and here's the

1811
01:14:00,419 --> 01:14:01,210
you throw it out

1812
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:02,090
and that's the idea

1813
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:03,929
it has not been hacked

1814
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:05,210
it has

1815
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:06,010
um

1816
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:06,969
um

1817
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:07,690
operated

1818
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:08,969
it is built

1819
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,370
it has come an amazing way

1820
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:12,330
um

1821
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,730
over that 11 years to be

1822
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,210
um

1823
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:21,130
maybe probably the most excited topic among a lot of people

1824
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,489
um and has been used and and is now um has obtained

1825
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:32,090
you know the status of having imputed value at the same time

1826
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:36,730
it is one of those assets that is an alternative money

1827
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,969
i think we're entering an era where um

1828
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,770
there's going to be a competition of monies

1829
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:44,969
um

1830
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,330
because of the printing of fiat money

1831
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:49,370
um

1832
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,170
and the depreciated value

1833
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,090
there will be a competition of monies

1834
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,010
um

1835
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:58,810
and bitcoin is part of that competition

1836
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,810
but there'll be many monies

1837
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:02,250
not just crypto monies

1838
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,050
but there'll be central bank crypto monies

1839
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,090
um

1840
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,210
but they'll be

1841
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:07,610
uh

1842
01:15:07,620 --> 01:15:08,730
different kinds of monies

1843
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:09,770
um

1844
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,290
and even monies

1845
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:11,929
um

1846
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,810
are things that you buy and sell nfts can become a money

1847
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:17,690
uh

1848
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,570
a type of money

1849
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,370
you own it

1850
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,010
and it's an investment

1851
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,810
and you could say i'd rather own it than own

1852
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:23,370
uh

1853
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:23,610
bitcoin

1854
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,610
has ray dalia bought any nfts not yet

1855
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:27,929
okay

1856
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:28,810
um

1857
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,090
but

1858
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:30,489
um

1859
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,010
only only just because

1860
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:32,330
like

1861
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:32,890
i

1862
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:36,250
i definitely want to buy nfts to just experience them

1863
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:36,650
you know

1864
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,050
like

1865
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:37,449
i think

1866
01:15:37,459 --> 01:15:38,810
think i should produce one

1867
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:39,290
yeah

1868
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:39,929
and i should

1869
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:40,330
uh

1870
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,370
i should have asked that

1871
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:42,170
have you made it

1872
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,690
have you minted an empty

1873
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,409
you probably should

1874
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,610
just to know what it's like

1875
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:45,850
yeah

1876
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:46,250
that's right

1877
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,449
this stuff is happening

1878
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,090
yeah

1879
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,050
this stuff is real okay and how it operates

1880
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,489
but like all new real things

1881
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:55,690
um

1882
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:57,050
some are gonna go

1883
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:57,850
and so i'm gonna

1884
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:58,250
you know

1885
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,810
it's like in the internet in the year 2000

1886
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:02,170
um

1887
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:02,730
you know

1888
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,050
pets. com could have been a great

1889
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,530
but maybe pets. com doesn't make it

1890
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,010
and who knows

1891
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,330
that's the beauty of the competitive system

1892
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,170
that will evolve and some things will be treasured and some things will be

1893
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:14,570
uh

1894
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:14,890
trashed

1895
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:16,010
so

1896
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:16,489
um

1897
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,290
um

1898
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,810
but when i look at it

1899
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:19,050
um

1900
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,929
i think we are in an environment of

1901
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,530
you know what is an alternative money

1902
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,210
a money has two purposes

1903
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,810
a medium of exchange and a storehold of wealth and we are looking for

1904
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,170
and it's portable and you can

1905
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,370
and it's best if it's recognized in other countries

1906
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:38,650
um

1907
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:41,530
so gold is one of those

1908
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,610
so i look at it as an alternative gold

1909
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,210
but i look at a number of things as alternative gold

1910
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:50,170
um

1911
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:51,690
and i think that

1912
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,409
and i think

1913
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,570
and gold is still my favorite because of certain qualities

1914
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:57,210
for example

1915
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:57,850
um

1916
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,090
you can't trace it in in bitcoin

1917
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,890
you can trace who owns it where it's going

1918
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,010
and and so on

1919
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:06,730
governments can't have that ability to trace it

1920
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:08,570
and so on a gold piece of coin

1921
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,050
it's

1922
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:09,929
it's not connected

1923
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,489
i think not connected has benefits

1924
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,130
particularly in a world where maybe connections can be more risky

1925
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,250
um

1926
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:18,969
so

1927
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:24,570
and then also gold has been for many thousands of years

1928
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,290
universally recognized as a source of money and central banks

1929
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,409
it's the third largest uh source of money in central bank reserves

1930
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:39,050
and i don't think bitcoin is going to serve those types of purposes

1931
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,010
and so on

1932
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,770
so for various reasons

1933
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,610
i prefer gold to the other

1934
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,090
but it's a little bit part of my mix

1935
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,929
but then you look at it

1936
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:48,489
it hit

1937
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,130
i think 69

1938
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,850
000 this year as the high bitcoin hit

1939
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,449
do you think it's possible

1940
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,570
you mentioned gold

1941
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:01,530
do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers like 1 million some people talk about

1942
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,650
i don't

1943
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:03,850
i don't think that's possible

1944
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,250
because the way i look at it is

1945
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:11,610
there's a certain amount of um

1946
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,730
[music] a certain amount of it

1947
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:17,530
and there's a certain amount of gold

1948
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,130
i'll use gold as a benchmark

1949
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:23,530
the amount of it is worth about five

1950
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:24,170
uh

1951
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,770
about one trillion dollars

1952
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,290
total cryptos

1953
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:28,890
about 2. 2 trillion

1954
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:30,409
but let's say bitcoin

1955
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:31,449
uh

1956
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:32,650
it's one trillion dollars

1957
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:38,650
if you take the amount of money that is in um gold

1958
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,489
that is not used for jewelry purposes and not used by central banks

1959
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,449
and i assume bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes or central bank purposes

1960
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:50,810
um

1961
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:54,250
that amount in gold is about five trillion dollars

1962
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:55,850
so right now

1963
01:18:56,239 --> 01:19:00,969
if you were to have a portfolio that has um gold and crypto

1964
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,489
um gold

1965
01:19:02,499 --> 01:19:03,130
then bitcoin

1966
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:06,650
it's worth about 20 of the value of gold

1967
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,130
do i think it's going to be

1968
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:09,690
uh

1969
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,449
worth more than gold in terms of that mix

1970
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,330
i don't think it'll be worth more than gold

1971
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:21,050
but let's say it became worth as as much as gold

1972
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:22,489
i don't believe it will be

1973
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,449
i think that 20 sounds kind of about right

1974
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,770
i really don't know that what the right answer is

1975
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:28,650
um

1976
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:33,050
and then there's the question of what is all of that pool of money

1977
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,010
that

1978
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:37,449
let's say gold and gold equivalents relative to everything else

1979
01:19:37,459 --> 01:19:38,890
does it go from

1980
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:40,170
you know

1981
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:42,090
let's call it six

1982
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,330
seven

1983
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:44,489
eight trillion to sixteen trillion

1984
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,530
maybe it could double

1985
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,850
it depends what it is in the world environment

1986
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,130
but basically

1987
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,210
if you use gold as a measure

1988
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:52,250
i

1989
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:52,570
um

1990
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:53,690
there's no

1991
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:57,449
it just makes no sense that it's going to be used

1992
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,449
um that much more

1993
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,449
am i sure about that

1994
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:02,730
i'm not sure about anything

1995
01:20:03,199 --> 01:20:03,449
but

1996
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:03,770
logically

1997
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:05,530
it seems to me

1998
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:12,090
that there's a limitation on its price in relationship to other things that are like it

1999
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,810
let me ask for your deep financial analysis on a very important issue

2000
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:17,610
uh

2001
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,370
i've just talked a couple days ago

2002
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:20,090
the elon musk

2003
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,810
he wants to put a literal dogecoin on the moon

2004
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:23,770
uh

2005
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:25,290
what are your thoughts about deutsche coin

2006
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:26,730
uh

2007
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:27,210
and

2008
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:27,690
uh

2009
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,690
do you think he'll be the official currency

2010
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:31,210
maybe

2011
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:31,770
uh

2012
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,489
reserve currency on the moon and on mars

2013
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,130
my reaction is that's cute

2014
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,409
i remember elon

2015
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:39,690
when he first got

2016
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,010
he

2017
01:20:40,159 --> 01:20:41,770
he first got his money from paypal

2018
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,330
i think he said to me it was

2019
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:46,730
he got 180 million dollars

2020
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:47,850
90 million dollars

2021
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,010
he decided to say why aren't we going to outer space

2022
01:20:52,400 --> 01:21:03,370
and he wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified using russian technology to put a um

2023
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,290
a plant and a watering can on the moon

2024
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:10,330
um

2025
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:12,090
or on mars

2026
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:13,770
i think it was um

2027
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:17,449
and and and he said first life on mars

2028
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,050
or first line as an inspiring

2029
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:22,889
uh notion

2030
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:26,810
and so then there's always what's behind it

2031
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:33,210
i have a lot of respect for elon's ability to do other things behind it

2032
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:33,850
uh

2033
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,449
and so i would take that as um symbolic

2034
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,090
and i'd be asking him what's behind it

2035
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:40,969
what's what's next

2036
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:44,969
and i'm also just on the topic of deutsche coin and meme coin and

2037
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:45,290
uh

2038
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:46,969
there's some aspect of humor and lightheartedness

2039
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:53,370
that's that's really interesting about the way we communicate what ideas become viral

2040
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,969
how to captivate people with ideas

2041
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,370
there's something about taking things too seriously that somehow slows it all down

2042
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,170
and it's interesting

2043
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:03,290
you're right

2044
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:04,570
that's part of human nature

2045
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:04,889
somehow

2046
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:05,449
so

2047
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,449
like humor is part of this whole thing

2048
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,090
you've

2049
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:10,570
uh

2050
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,050
talked about the importance of writing ideas down

2051
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:14,570
and

2052
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:14,810
uh

2053
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,690
you have principles

2054
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:16,409
in particular

2055
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,770
in principles and you have this really nice thing in your

2056
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:20,409
in your book

2057
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:21,370
we actually

2058
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:21,690
um

2059
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,090
i think there's such a brilliant way

2060
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:25,050
okay

2061
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,010
uh

2062
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:32,730
you have such a brilliant way of highlighting which parts are extra important and you make them bold

2063
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,250
that's a brilliant idea

2064
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:38,489
but let me just ask the high-level question of what's a good system for um

2065
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:40,969
taking notes

2066
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,250
well

2067
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,409
i find that almost everything happens over and over again

2068
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:47,690
um

2069
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,530
and we're in this

2070
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,610
the blizzard of these things happening

2071
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:56,170
and what i found is that if i'm making a decision

2072
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:03,050
that that after i make the decision usually or right at the time

2073
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,570
if i pause and reflect and i write my principle down

2074
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:09,290
in other words

2075
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,370
principle is sort of a recipe

2076
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:14,010
what would i use to

2077
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,250
how would i make that decision and what are the criteria around it

2078
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,130
i find that i make it much more clear

2079
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,090
it becomes clearer and it applies to the next thing that comes along

2080
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,850
it'll be that way

2081
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,650
because everything happens over and over and over again

2082
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:36,889
and i think people make the mistake of looking at just the one like it's the first one they have

2083
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:42,090
i don't know they have the first problem of this sort of the first child or whatever it is

2084
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:44,250
and this has been happening plenty of times

2085
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:45,130
and so

2086
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,010
if you have the principles

2087
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,330
i found that that helped me think more clearly about it

2088
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,610
and it helped me communicate better like why

2089
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:54,889
and so

2090
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:55,850
over the years

2091
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,010
over the last 30 years or so

2092
01:23:58,800 --> 01:23:59,770
that's what i've done

2093
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,850
i did it originally to communicate very well with the people i work with

2094
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:04,489
um

2095
01:24:04,499 --> 01:24:04,889
you know

2096
01:24:04,899 --> 01:24:06,889
i set up my company and and i

2097
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:08,330
it was very important to have good communication

2098
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,810
and then we could debate the principles

2099
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,130
and so that's the process

2100
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,170
i urge people to do that

2101
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,650
there are many excellent decision makers

2102
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:19,370
um

2103
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,650
and i just wish that they wrote down their principles when this set

2104
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:25,449
so

2105
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:26,570
for example

2106
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,250
we talked about henry kissinger and his new book is going to come out with a book on leadership

2107
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:33,370
um

2108
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,130
and don't just describe the leaders describe

2109
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,130
then what about them

2110
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:43,290
were the essential elements to make a good leader under what circumstances

2111
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,090
and so if we think about that

2112
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:46,810
when

2113
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,690
then also

2114
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,170
then you begin to think in a principled way and then

2115
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,730
when you start to think in a principle way

2116
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:55,690
life becomes

2117
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:00,090
it's so much easier to make decisions and it's so much less confusing

2118
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,810
because it's like coming up on a species and you say

2119
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:05,290
okay

2120
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:05,850
well

2121
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:06,650
what species

2122
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:08,969
is it not just another

2123
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,090
it's a thing

2124
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:10,730
no

2125
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,090
what species is it

2126
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,730
and how do i deal with that species effectively

2127
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:16,010
and

2128
01:25:16,159 --> 01:25:17,610
and so that's what that is

2129
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,170
and so i encourage people to write it down

2130
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:21,929
i wish anybody who's successful

2131
01:25:22,719 --> 01:25:26,489
wrote down their principles or their recipes for making those types of decisions

2132
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:33,050
so the events of interest here happens over and over and over in similar ways

2133
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,929
as you're looking for the patterns and you're defining the process that's right to respond to those patterns

2134
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:45,690
and you call that the principles and that allows you to deal with the future

2135
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:46,090
effectively

2136
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:51,290
so like that codifies the lessons from the past to be able to deal with the future

2137
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:54,889
what advice do you have for young folks today

2138
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:56,090
in high school

2139
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:56,969
in college

2140
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,730
thinking about how to live

2141
01:25:58,800 --> 01:25:59,050
uh

2142
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,730
have a career they can be proud of or maybe have a life they can be proud of

2143
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:05,850
know yourself

2144
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,170
follow your passion

2145
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:14,570
make your work and passion the same thing while considering the money part

2146
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:19,370
because money will get you freedom and choice and be able to make that

2147
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:21,850
but if you know yourself

2148
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:28,090
feel the pull um and um and pursue that passion

2149
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:29,290
um

2150
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,210
and along those lines

2151
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:32,409
by the way i found

2152
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:33,130
um

2153
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,370
that using personality profile tests has been very helpful

2154
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,850
i've used those for about 25 years for people to help to understand themselves and understand each other

2155
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:48,889
so i created a free one that is called principles you

2156
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:49,530
it's online

2157
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,370
it's had remarkable

2158
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,290
loving people who've taken it

2159
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:58,090
learn about themselves

2160
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:03,449
but also you can put in somebody else and it'll tell you about your relationship with them

2161
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,449
that's like 30 minutes

2162
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,409
is a quick discovery

2163
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:10,409
but the main thing is to understand on your journey

2164
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:11,690
your hero's journey

2165
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:13,290
when you're um

2166
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:23,050
that you will have uh mistakes and you will have weaknesses and to understand those

2167
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,330
not fight those

2168
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,929
because by understanding mistakes

2169
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,489
you will learn not to make mistakes again

2170
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:31,770
i have a principle

2171
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,210
which is pain

2172
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,170
plus reflection equals progress

2173
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:40,810
and so that reflection is important to know yourself

2174
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:41,850
know your pulls

2175
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:43,290
know your weaknesses

2176
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:48,170
and when you also know your weaknesses and the strengths of other people

2177
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,409
there are people who um

2178
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,290
have strengths

2179
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,130
where you're weak and you have strengths

2180
01:27:53,280 --> 01:28:00,090
where they're weak and to be able to work well together is the most effective way of achieving

2181
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:00,969
uh

2182
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:01,449
success

2183
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,050
so yeah

2184
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:06,250
it's that journey and there's a life arc

2185
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,810
and there's a journey and you want to make it the best that you can make it

2186
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:12,250
and it has

2187
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:14,330
it's like a video game

2188
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:15,050
you know

2189
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:21,690
it has the challenges and the obstacles and the learning experiences and the temptations

2190
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,409
and all of that and the maximizing learning to go

2191
01:28:26,419 --> 01:28:31,210
where you want to go to achieve the life you want is the most important

2192
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,330
that's kind of maybe a long-winded way of suing it

2193
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:35,690
but to learn

2194
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,489
i think i'll try to say it simply

2195
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:40,489
there's a five-step process

2196
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:42,889
step one is

2197
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:44,570
know your goals

2198
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,969
know what you're going after

2199
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,170
you could have almost anything you want

2200
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,850
but you can't have everything you want

2201
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:57,050
and so you have to prioritize and you move in that direction on the way to your goals

2202
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,690
you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles

2203
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:06,010
so identifying step two is understanding your problems and your obstacles

2204
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:07,050
identify them

2205
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,570
step three is to diagnose them

2206
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:12,969
to get at the root cause of the problem

2207
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:16,250
and that could be many root causes

2208
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,449
but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others

2209
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,530
but you have to be objective about them

2210
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,530
once you diagnose them

2211
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,690
then you go to step four

2212
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,969
which is to design a way to get around them

2213
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,449
and then

2214
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,050
after you have that design

2215
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:35,210
you implement that design

2216
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,530
so you have to follow through and do it

2217
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,889
and you do that

2218
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,409
and and that will then produce its new results

2219
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,969
which should be better results i have

2220
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,969
i call this kind of the looping process

2221
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,370
it's the evolutionary looping process

2222
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:50,409
and

2223
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:51,050
um

2224
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:52,170
you do

2225
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:53,210
you just keep doing that

2226
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:57,370
and you learn over a period of time and you move in the direction that you want

2227
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:58,969
last question

2228
01:29:59,120 --> 01:30:01,050
and you only have one minute to answer it

2229
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:05,610
you dedicate the book quote to my grandchildren

2230
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:11,770
and those of their generation who will be participants in the continuation of the story

2231
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:15,050
may the force of evolution be with you

2232
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:16,330
so let me ask

2233
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,290
where is this force of evolution taking human civilization

2234
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:29,850
and what in this story that evolution is writing gives you hope evolution isn't a direction toward improvement

2235
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:31,530
um

2236
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:38,969
and the greatest force is a man's capacity to adapt and invent

2237
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,889
and so you see

2238
01:30:40,899 --> 01:30:42,090
in the charts in the book

2239
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:43,929
you see that

2240
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:44,650
um

2241
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,929
this upward movement

2242
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:47,210
life expectancy

2243
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:49,290
um

2244
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:50,570
uh

2245
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,570
health or all the things that we think are better

2246
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:55,770
you see the

2247
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:56,810
there's a chart

2248
01:30:57,040 --> 01:31:04,409
and it shows that over a period of time and you barely see the downturns from depressions and wars

2249
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,690
in that that is the greatest power

2250
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,250
man's ability to invent and adapt is evolution

2251
01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:15,050
and that's the greatest power

2252
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:21,370
and that is what gives me justifiable hope and a continuation of that

2253
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:22,650
like we mentioned with elon

2254
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:25,290
maybe we'll become a multi-planetary species

2255
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,050
so not only will we keep creating amazing things here on earth

2256
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,810
will keep expanding out into the cosmos

2257
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,770
my time horizon isn't

2258
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:36,409
doesn't have me analyzing that yet

2259
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,050
but i

2260
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:37,530
i

2261
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:38,570
i hope

2262
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:38,810
so

2263
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:39,210
and i

2264
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:39,610
uh

2265
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,929
agree that that would mean the nature

2266
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:45,130
so i'm not going to ask you for the best financial system on mars

2267
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:45,770
um

2268
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:47,530
i think we'll focus on earth for now

2269
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,010
right

2270
01:31:48,020 --> 01:31:49,929
thank you so much for your brilliance for the

2271
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,690
for the books you've written for the works you've done for the inspiration from of millions

2272
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,170
so

2273
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,929
and thank you for spending your valuable time here with me today

2274
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:58,810

and now let me leave you with some words from ray dalio

2279
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,170
himself

2280
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,130
every time you confront something painful

2281
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:16,489
you are at a potentially important juncture in your life

2282
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:23,929
you have the opportunity to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion

2283
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,409
thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
